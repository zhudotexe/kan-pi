The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only 2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national and/or European competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Barcelona** (/ˌbɑːrsəˈloʊnə/ ⓘ *BAR-sə-LOH-nə*, Catalan: [bəɾsəˈlonə] ⓘ, Spanish: [baɾθeˈlona] ⓘ) is a city on the northeastern coast of Spain. It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[7] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics.[57][58] The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (−16.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9 percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6 percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed 56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just 6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5 percent of the population.[80][81]\n\n\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents in Barcelona[82]\n| Nationality | Population(2019) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Italy | 36,276\n |\n| China | 21,658\n |\n| Pakistan | 20,643\n |\n| France | 16,940\n |\n| Morocco | 14,418\n |\n| Colombia | 12,290\n |\n| Honduras | 11,744\n |\n| Peru | 10,558\n |\n| Venezuela | 10,185\n |\n| Philippines | 9,439\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Ajuntament de Barcelona\".

Less well known is that the city industrialised early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.\n\n\nBorsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation.\n\n\n\n### Late twentieth century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and 3 km (2 mi) of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.[50][51][52][53][54]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% respectively 3.9%.[75]\n\n\nThe most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[75] Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[83]\n\n\nThere exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Estadi Olímpic de Montjuïc (Barcelona Olympic Stadium) built for the 1936 Summer Olympics named *People's Olympiad*, main stadium of 1992 Summer Olympics\n![](image)The Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe\nBarcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums).

Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 residents, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.[78]\n\n\n\n### Population density[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion.[89] A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169 locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain).[86] In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5 million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim,[89] which makes 5.6% of the total population.\n\n\nThe city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city.[90] There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71 locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah's Witnesses (21 Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13 locations),[91] and Eastern Orthodox.[92]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n### General information[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Spain | * ***Barcelona***, Catalonia\n* ***Las Palmas*** & ***Santa Cruz de Tenerife***, Canary Islands\n* ***Logroño***, La Rioja\n* ***Madrid***, Community of Madrid\n* ***Mérida***, Extremadura\n* ***Murcia***, Region of Murcia\n* ***Oviedo***, Asturias\n* ***Palma de Mallorca***, Balearic Islands\n* ***Pamplona***, Navarre\n* ***Santander***, Cantabria\n* ***Santiago de Compostela***, Galicia\n* ***Seville***, Andalusia\n* ***Toledo***, Castilla–La Mancha (de facto)\n* ***Valencia***, Valencian Community\n* ***Valladolid***, Castile and León (de facto)\n* ***Vitoria-Gasteiz***, Basque Country (de facto)\n* ***Zaragoza***, Aragon\n |\n| Other | * ***Ajaccio***, Corsica Collectivité (France)\n* ***Batumi***, Adjara (Georgia)\n* ***Comrat***, Gagauzia (Moldova)\n* ***Karyes***, Mount Athos (Greece)\n* ***Mariehamn***, Åland Islands (Finland)\n* ***Nakhchivan***, Nakhchivan (Azerbaijan)\n* ***Novi Sad***, Vojvodina (Serbia)\n* ***Simferopol***, Crimea (Ukraine)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n96. **^** \"The Monocle Quality of Life Survey 2015\". *Monocle*. 2015.

He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day.

Half of the municipality or 50.2 km2, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area and Montjuïc forest park.

Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of security and personal safety,[109] mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by *Business Insider* in 2016.[110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ![](image) This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.

These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640 m (1,310 to 2,100 ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline.

It is Europe's ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in 2013.[146] The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river 2 km (1 mi) to the south.[147]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Autonomous regions | * ***Cagliari***, Sardinia\n* ***Palermo***, Sicily\n* ***Trento***, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol\n* ***Aosta***, Aosta Valley\n* ***Trieste***, Friuli Venezia Giulia\n |\n\n |\n| Portugal | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Autonomous regions | * ***Ponta Delgada, Angra do Heroísmo, & Horta***, Azores\n* ***Funchal***, Madeira\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBarcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la Música Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue.[137] It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers. Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the Sónar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBuses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.\n\n\nThe Estació del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome older sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC,[22] but there is no evidence that Barcelona was ever a Carthaginian settlement, or that its name in antiquity, *Barcino*, had any connection with the Barcid family of Hamilcar.[23] During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as *Barchinona*, *Barçalona*, *Barchelonaa*, and *Barchenona*.\n\n\nInternationally,[*citation needed*] Barcelona's name is abbreviated colloquially to 'Barça' as a result of its status as the hometown of the football club FC Barcelona, whose anthem is the *Cant del Barça* (\"Barça chant\"). A common abbreviated form used by locals for the city is *Barna*.\n\n\nAnother common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Park Güell\n![](image)Parc de la Ciutadella north of La Barceloneta\nBarcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest.[168] They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or 1,358.3 acres).[65] The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres) per year,[169] with a proportion of 18.1 m2 (195 sq ft) of park area per inhabitant.[170]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Switzerland | * ***Aarau***, Aargau\n* ***Altdorf***, Uri\n* ***Appenzell***, Appenzell Innerrhoden\n* ***Basel***, Basel-Stadt\n* ***Bellinzona***, Ticino\n* ***Chur***, Grisons\n* ***Delémont***, Jura\n* ***Frauenfeld***, Thurgau\n* ***Fribourg***, Canton of Fribourg\n* ***Geneva***, Canton of Geneva\n* ***Herisau***, Appenzell Ausserrhoden\n* ***Lausanne***, Vaud\n* ***Liestal***, Basel-Landschaft\n* ***Lucerne***, Canton of Lucerne\n* ***Neuchâtel***, Canton of Neuchâtel\n* ***Sarnen***, Obwalden\n* ***Schaffhausen***, Canton of Schaffhausen\n* ***Schwyz***, Canton of Schwyz\n* ***Sion***, Valais\n* ***Solothurn***, Canton of Solothurn\n* ***Stans***, Nidwalden\n* ***St. Gallen***, Canton of St. Gallen\n* ***Glarus***, Canton of Glarus\n* ***Zug***, Canton of Zug\n* ***Zürich***, Canton of Zürich\n |\n\n |\n| Autonomousentities | \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Italy | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n149. **^** \"Barcelona estrena TGV\" (in Catalan).

It is 120 km (75 mi) south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBarcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the *Carta Municipal* (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.[125] According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organised in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administers the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.[126] This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.[127] It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBarcelona was recognised as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential,[99] by *FDi Magazine* in their bi-annual rankings.[100]\n\n\n\n### Trade fair and exhibitions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nThe World Trade Center Barcelona\n![](image)\nThe Palau de Congressos de Barcelona\n\nDrawing upon its tradition of creative art and craftsmanship, Barcelona is known for its award-winning industrial design. It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona – the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is 405,000 m2 (41 ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSpanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it.[76] Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system.\n\n\nAfter Catalan and Spanish, the most spoken languages in Barcelona are those from North Africa, such as Amazigh and Arabic, followed by Bengali, Urdu, Panjabi, Mandarin Chinese, Romanian, English, Russian and Quechua, according to data collected by the University of Barcelona.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Port Vell in winter\nThe Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base.[148] In 2013, 3.6 million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.[146]\n\n\nThe Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums – Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays.\n\n\n\n### National and international rail[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** \"110th Christmas Cup for Swimming\". *timeout.com/barcelona*.

It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17 million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend.[145] It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ***Krasnogorsk and Moscow***, Moscow Oblast (de facto)\n* ***Kursk***, Kursk Oblast\n* ***Lipetsk***, Lipetsk Oblast\n* ***Murmansk***, Murmansk Oblast\n* ***Nizhny Novgorod***, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast\n* ***Orenburg***, Orenburg Oblast\n* ***Oryol***, Oryol Oblast\n* ***Penza***, Penza Oblast\n* ***Pskov***, Pskov Oblast\n* ***Rostov-on-Don***, Rostov Oblast\n* ***Ryazan***, Ryazan Oblast\n* ***Saint Petersburg***, Leningrad Oblast (de facto)\n* ***Samara***, Samara Oblast\n* ***Saratov***, Saratov Oblast\n* ***Smolensk***, Smolensk Oblast\n* ***Tambov***, Tambov Oblast\n* ***Tula***, Tula Oblast\n* ***Tver***, Tver Oblast\n* ***Ulyanovsk***, Ulyanovsk Oblast\n* ***Veliky Novgorod***, Novgorod Oblast\n* ***Vladimir***, Vladimir Oblast\n* ***Volgograd***, Volgograd Oblast\n* ***Vologda***, Vologda Oblast\n* ***Voronezh***, Voronezh Oblast\n* ***Yaroslavl***, Yaroslavl Oblast\n |\n| Federal cities | * ***Moscow***, Moscow\n* ***Saint Petersburg***, Saint Petersburg\n* ***Sevastopol***, Sevastopol (disputed)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Sagrada Família church, designed by Gaudí\n![](image)Palau de la Música Catalana\nThe *Barri Gòtic* (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan *modernista* architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaudí, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Família, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015[update], completion is planned for 2026.[160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n168. **^** Parcs i Jardins, Institut Municipal. \"Parcs i Jardins> Els Parcs> Els Parcs de Barcelona\". Bcn.es.

The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only 2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national and/or European competitions.

It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[7] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics.[57][58] The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (−16.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9 percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6 percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed 56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just 6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5 percent of the population.[80][81]\n\n\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents in Barcelona[82]\n| Nationality | Population(2019) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Italy | 36,276\n |\n| China | 21,658\n |\n| Pakistan | 20,643\n |\n| France | 16,940\n |\n| Morocco | 14,418\n |\n| Colombia | 12,290\n |\n| Honduras | 11,744\n |\n| Peru | 10,558\n |\n| Venezuela | 10,185\n |\n| Philippines | 9,439\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Ajuntament de Barcelona\".

Less well known is that the city industrialised early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.\n\n\nBorsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation.\n\n\n\n### Late twentieth century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and 3 km (2 mi) of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.[50][51][52][53][54]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% respectively 3.9%.[75]\n\n\nThe most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[75] Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[83]\n\n\nThere exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Estadi Olímpic de Montjuïc (Barcelona Olympic Stadium) built for the 1936 Summer Olympics named *People's Olympiad*, main stadium of 1992 Summer Olympics\n![](image)The Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe\nBarcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums).

Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area.

He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day.

There's also the Ultratrail Collserola which passes 85 km (53 mi) through the Collserola forest. The Open Seat Godó, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. Each year on Christmas Day, a 200-meter swimming race across the Old Port of Barcelona takes place.[142] Near Barcelona, in Montmeló, the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n52. **^** Usborne, Simon (18 August 2008). \"After The Party: What happens when the Olympics leave town\". *The Independent*.

The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.[151]\n\n\nThe Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an \"L\" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Summer Paralympic Games host cities\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * **1960:** ![Italy](image) Rome\n* **1964:** ![Japan](image) Tokyo\n* **1968:** ![Israel](image) Tel Aviv\n* **1972:** ![West Germany](image) Heidelberg\n* **1976:** ![Canada](image) Toronto\n | * **1980:** ![Netherlands](image) Arnhem\n* **1984:** ![United States](image) New York City / ![United Kingdom](image) Stoke Mandeville\n* **1988:** ![South Korea](image) Seoul\n* **1992:** ![Spain](image) Barcelona / ![Spain](image) Madrid\n* **1996:** ![United States](image) Atlanta\n | * **2000:** ![Australia](image) Sydney\n* **2004:** ![Greece](image) Athens\n* **2008:** ![China](image) Beijing\n* **2012:** ![United Kingdom](image) London\n | * **2016:** ![Brazil](image) Rio de Janeiro\n* **2020:** ![Japan](image) Tokyo\n* **2024:** ![France](image) *Paris*\n* **2028:** ![United States](image) *Los Angeles*\n* **2032:** ![Australia](image) *Brisbane*\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adrià de Besòs to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del Vallès, and Montcada i Reixac to the west.

These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640 m (1,310 to 2,100 ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access during summer season.\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\n### Twin towns – sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Spain\n\nBarcelona is twinned with:[174]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n174. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Direcció de Relacions Internacionals\". *ajuntament.barcelona.cat* (in Catalan).

It is Europe's ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in 2013.[146] The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river 2 km (1 mi) to the south.[147]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Autonomous regions | * ***Cagliari***, Sardinia\n* ***Palermo***, Sicily\n* ***Trento***, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol\n* ***Aosta***, Aosta Valley\n* ***Trieste***, Friuli Venezia Giulia\n |\n\n |\n| Portugal | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Autonomous regions | * ***Ponta Delgada, Angra do Heroísmo, & Horta***, Azores\n* ***Funchal***, Madeira\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBarcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la Música Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue.[137] It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers. Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the Sónar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBuses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.\n\n\nThe Estació del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome older sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC,[22] but there is no evidence that Barcelona was ever a Carthaginian settlement, or that its name in antiquity, *Barcino*, had any connection with the Barcid family of Hamilcar.[23] During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as *Barchinona*, *Barçalona*, *Barchelonaa*, and *Barchenona*.\n\n\nInternationally,[*citation needed*] Barcelona's name is abbreviated colloquially to 'Barça' as a result of its status as the hometown of the football club FC Barcelona, whose anthem is the *Cant del Barça* (\"Barça chant\"). A common abbreviated form used by locals for the city is *Barna*.\n\n\nAnother common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Park Güell\n![](image)Parc de la Ciutadella north of La Barceloneta\nBarcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest.[168] They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or 1,358.3 acres).[65] The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres) per year,[169] with a proportion of 18.1 m2 (195 sq ft) of park area per inhabitant.[170]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Switzerland | * ***Aarau***, Aargau\n* ***Altdorf***, Uri\n* ***Appenzell***, Appenzell Innerrhoden\n* ***Basel***, Basel-Stadt\n* ***Bellinzona***, Ticino\n* ***Chur***, Grisons\n* ***Delémont***, Jura\n* ***Frauenfeld***, Thurgau\n* ***Fribourg***, Canton of Fribourg\n* ***Geneva***, Canton of Geneva\n* ***Herisau***, Appenzell Ausserrhoden\n* ***Lausanne***, Vaud\n* ***Liestal***, Basel-Landschaft\n* ***Lucerne***, Canton of Lucerne\n* ***Neuchâtel***, Canton of Neuchâtel\n* ***Sarnen***, Obwalden\n* ***Schaffhausen***, Canton of Schaffhausen\n* ***Schwyz***, Canton of Schwyz\n* ***Sion***, Valais\n* ***Solothurn***, Canton of Solothurn\n* ***Stans***, Nidwalden\n* ***St. Gallen***, Canton of St. Gallen\n* ***Glarus***, Canton of Glarus\n* ***Zug***, Canton of Zug\n* ***Zürich***, Canton of Zürich\n |\n\n |\n| Autonomousentities | \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Italy | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n149. **^** \"Barcelona estrena TGV\" (in Catalan).

It is 120 km (75 mi) south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBarcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the *Carta Municipal* (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.[125] According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organised in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administers the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.[126] This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.[127] It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBarcelona was recognised as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential,[99] by *FDi Magazine* in their bi-annual rankings.[100]\n\n\n\n### Trade fair and exhibitions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nThe World Trade Center Barcelona\n![](image)\nThe Palau de Congressos de Barcelona\n\nDrawing upon its tradition of creative art and craftsmanship, Barcelona is known for its award-winning industrial design. It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona – the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is 405,000 m2 (41 ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSpanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it.[76] Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system.\n\n\nAfter Catalan and Spanish, the most spoken languages in Barcelona are those from North Africa, such as Amazigh and Arabic, followed by Bengali, Urdu, Panjabi, Mandarin Chinese, Romanian, English, Russian and Quechua, according to data collected by the University of Barcelona.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Port Vell in winter\nThe Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base.[148] In 2013, 3.6 million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.[146]\n\n\nThe Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums – Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays.\n\n\n\n### National and international rail[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** \"110th Christmas Cup for Swimming\". *timeout.com/barcelona*.

It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17 million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend.[145] It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ***Krasnogorsk and Moscow***, Moscow Oblast (de facto)\n* ***Kursk***, Kursk Oblast\n* ***Lipetsk***, Lipetsk Oblast\n* ***Murmansk***, Murmansk Oblast\n* ***Nizhny Novgorod***, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast\n* ***Orenburg***, Orenburg Oblast\n* ***Oryol***, Oryol Oblast\n* ***Penza***, Penza Oblast\n* ***Pskov***, Pskov Oblast\n* ***Rostov-on-Don***, Rostov Oblast\n* ***Ryazan***, Ryazan Oblast\n* ***Saint Petersburg***, Leningrad Oblast (de facto)\n* ***Samara***, Samara Oblast\n* ***Saratov***, Saratov Oblast\n* ***Smolensk***, Smolensk Oblast\n* ***Tambov***, Tambov Oblast\n* ***Tula***, Tula Oblast\n* ***Tver***, Tver Oblast\n* ***Ulyanovsk***, Ulyanovsk Oblast\n* ***Veliky Novgorod***, Novgorod Oblast\n* ***Vladimir***, Vladimir Oblast\n* ***Volgograd***, Volgograd Oblast\n* ***Vologda***, Vologda Oblast\n* ***Voronezh***, Voronezh Oblast\n* ***Yaroslavl***, Yaroslavl Oblast\n |\n| Federal cities | * ***Moscow***, Moscow\n* ***Saint Petersburg***, Saint Petersburg\n* ***Sevastopol***, Sevastopol (disputed)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Sagrada Família church, designed by Gaudí\n![](image)Palau de la Música Catalana\nThe *Barri Gòtic* (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan *modernista* architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaudí, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Família, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015[update], completion is planned for 2026.[160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n168. **^** Parcs i Jardins, Institut Municipal. \"Parcs i Jardins> Els Parcs> Els Parcs de Barcelona\". Bcn.es.

It hosts the France national football team for friendlies and major tournaments qualifiers, annually hosts the French national rugby team's home matches of the Six Nations Championship, and hosts several important matches of the Stade Français rugby team.[272] In addition to Paris Saint-Germain F.C., the city has a number of other professional and amateur football clubs: Paris FC, Red Star, RCF Paris and Stade Français Paris.\n\n\nParis hosted the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCities in France by population\n |\n| --- |\n| 2,000,000+ | * Paris\n |\n| 500,000+ | * Marseille\n* Lyon\n* Toulouse\n |\n| 200,000+ | * Nice\n* Nantes\n* Montpellier\n* Strasbourg\n* Bordeaux\n* Lille\n* Rennes\n |\n| 100,000+ | * Toulon\n* Reims\n* Saint-Étienne\n* Le Havre\n* Dijon\n* Grenoble\n* Angers\n* Villeurbanne\n* Saint-Denis, Réunion\n* Nîmes\n* Aix-en-Provence\n* Clermont-Ferrand\n* Le Mans\n* Brest\n* Tours\n* Amiens\n* Annecy\n* Limoges\n* Metz\n* Boulogne-Billancourt\n* Perpignan\n* Besançon\n* Orléans\n* Rouen\n* Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis\n* Montreuil\n* Caen\n* Argenteuil\n* Mulhouse\n* Saint-Paul\n* Nancy\n |\n| * Complete list\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city also hosted the finals of the 1938 FIFA World Cup (at the Stade Olympique de Colombes), as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final (both at the Stade de France).

Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".[157]\nThe population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.[158] The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Répertoire national des élus: les maires\" (in French). data.gouv.fr, Plateforme ouverte des données publiques françaises. 16 December 2022.

According to INSEE, the population has dropped by 122,919, or about five percent, over the past decade. The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, declared that this illustrated the \"de-densification\" of the city, creating more green space and less crowding.[153][154] Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks.[155] This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, the departure of middle-class residents and the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.[156]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. According to the same census, three departments bordering Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, had population densities of over 10,000 people per square kilometre, ranking among the 10 most densely populated areas of the EU.[166][*verification needed*]\n\n\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\nUnder French law, people born in foreign countries with no French citizenship at birth are defined as immigrants.

Of the foreign visitors, the greatest number came from the United States (2.6 million), United Kingdom (1.2 million), Germany (981 thousand) and China (711 thousand).[204]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe other most-visited Paris museums in 2021 were the Fondation Louis Vuitton (691,000), the Musée du Quai Branly – Jacques Chirac, featuring the indigenous art and cultures of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. (616,000); the Musée Carnavalet (History of Paris) (606,000), and the Petit Palais, the art museum of the City of Paris (518,000).[213]\n\n\n\n![](image)Musée du quai Branly\nThe Musée de l'Orangerie, near both the Louvre and the Orsay, also exhibits Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, including most of Claude Monet's large *Water Lilies* murals. The Musée national du Moyen Âge, or Cluny Museum, presents Medieval art. The Guimet Museum, or *Musée national des arts asiatiques*, has one of the largest collections of Asian art in Europe. There are also notable museums devoted to individual artists, including the Musée Picasso, the Musée Rodin and the Musée national Eugène Delacroix.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before, 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974, and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date.[139] Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, but it is much less than Île-de-France's 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire Île-de-France): the major part of the city's population is a rent-paying one.[139] Social or public housing represented 19.9 percent of the city's total residences in 2017. Its distribution varies widely throughout the city, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement, to 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement.[140]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to the 2020 Paris municipal election, each of Paris's 20 arrondissements had its own town hall and a directly elected council (*conseil d'arrondissement*), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor.[114] The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris and also members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. As of 1996, there were a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.[109] The creation of Paris Centre, a unified administrative division with a single mayor covering the first four arrondissements, took effect with the said 2020 election; the other 16 arrondissements continue to have their own mayors.[115]\n\n\n\n### Métropole du Grand Paris[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most prestigious sculptors who made their reputation in Paris in the modern era are Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi (Statue of Liberty), Auguste Rodin, Camille Claudel, Antoine Bourdelle, Paul Landowski (statue of *Christ the Redeemer* in Rio de Janeiro) and Aristide Maillol. The Golden Age of the School of Paris ended between the two world wars.\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of museums in Paris\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nParis is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport (the third-busiest airport in Europe) and Orly Airport.[11][12] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily;[13] it is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[14] Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 7.8 million visitors in 2022, keeping its position as the most-visited art museum in the world.[15] The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre Musée National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe and Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the inauguration of its first line in 1900, Paris's Métro network has grown to become the city's most widely used local transport system; today it carries about 5.23 million passengers daily[283] through 16 lines, 308 stations (391 stops) and 226.9 km (141.0 mi) of rails. Superimposed on this is a 'regional express network', the RER, whose five lines, 257 stops and 587 km (365 mi) of rails connect Paris to more distant parts of the urban area. In addition, the Paris region is served by a light rail network, the tramway. Opened since 1992 for its first line, thirteen lines are currently operational. The network is 164.4 kilometres (102.2 mi) long with 248 stations.\n\n\n\n#### Air[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls.[231] Patrons danced the bourrée to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a \"musette\") and often the vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy) in the cafés and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars,[232] anParis became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés.[233]\n\n\nParis is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city.[232] Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist Stéphane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.[234]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n173. **^** Burchardt, Marian; Michalowski, Ines (26 November 2014). *After Integration: Islam, Conviviality and Contentious Politics in Europe*.

Paris Fashion Week, held in January and July in the Carrousel du Louvre among other renowned city locations, is one of the top four events on the international fashion calendar.[253][254] Moreover, Paris is also the home of the world's largest cosmetics company: L'Oréal as well as three of the top five global makers of luxury fashion accessories: Louis Vuitton, Hermés, and Cartier.[255] Most of the major fashion designers have their showrooms along the Avenue Montaigne, between the Champs-Élysées and the Seine.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Sorbonne University\nParis is the département with the highest proportion of highly educated people. In 2009, around 40 percent of Parisians held a *licence*-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in France,[309] while 13 percent have no diploma, the third-lowest percentage in France. Education in Paris and the Île-de-France region employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors teaching approximately 2.9 million students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions.[310]\n\n\nThe University of Paris, founded in the 12th century, is often called the Sorbonne after one of its original medieval colleges. It was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around the city and the suburbs.[311]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A map of the arrondissements of Paris\nFor almost all of its long history, except for a few brief periods, Paris was governed directly by representatives of the king, emperor, or president of France. The city was not granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly until 1974.[109] The first modern elected mayor of Paris was Jacques Chirac, elected 20 March 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1871 and only the fourth since 1794. The current mayor is Anne Hidalgo, a socialist, first elected 5 April 2014[110] and re-elected 28 June 2020.[111]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_ypqaOf9r2hiAs8ST67saZviW","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It hosts the France national football team for friendlies and major tournaments qualifiers, annually hosts the French national rugby team's home matches of the Six Nations Championship, and hosts several important matches of the Stade Français rugby team.[272] In addition to Paris Saint-Germain F.C., the city has a number of other professional and amateur football clubs: Paris FC, Red Star, RCF Paris and Stade Français Paris.\n\n\nParis hosted the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCities in France by population\n |\n| --- |\n| 2,000,000+ | * Paris\n |\n| 500,000+ | * Marseille\n* Lyon\n* Toulouse\n |\n| 200,000+ | * Nice\n* Nantes\n* Montpellier\n* Strasbourg\n* Bordeaux\n* Lille\n* Rennes\n |\n| 100,000+ | * Toulon\n* Reims\n* Saint-Étienne\n* Le Havre\n* Dijon\n* Grenoble\n* Angers\n* Villeurbanne\n* Saint-Denis, Réunion\n* Nîmes\n* Aix-en-Provence\n* Clermont-Ferrand\n* Le Mans\n* Brest\n* Tours\n* Amiens\n* Annecy\n* Limoges\n* Metz\n* Boulogne-Billancourt\n* Perpignan\n* Besançon\n* Orléans\n* Rouen\n* Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis\n* Montreuil\n* Caen\n* Argenteuil\n* Mulhouse\n* Saint-Paul\n* Nancy\n |\n| * Complete list\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city also hosted the finals of the 1938 FIFA World Cup (at the Stade Olympique de Colombes), as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final (both at the Stade de France).

Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".[157]\nThe population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.[158] The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Répertoire national des élus: les maires\" (in French). data.gouv.fr, Plateforme ouverte des données publiques françaises. 16 December 2022.

Of the foreign visitors, the greatest number came from the United States (2.6 million), United Kingdom (1.2 million), Germany (981 thousand) and China (711 thousand).[204]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe other most-visited Paris museums in 2021 were the Fondation Louis Vuitton (691,000), the Musée du Quai Branly – Jacques Chirac, featuring the indigenous art and cultures of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. (616,000); the Musée Carnavalet (History of Paris) (606,000), and the Petit Palais, the art museum of the City of Paris (518,000).[213]\n\n\n\n![](image)Musée du quai Branly\nThe Musée de l'Orangerie, near both the Louvre and the Orsay, also exhibits Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, including most of Claude Monet's large *Water Lilies* murals. The Musée national du Moyen Âge, or Cluny Museum, presents Medieval art. The Guimet Museum, or *Musée national des arts asiatiques*, has one of the largest collections of Asian art in Europe. There are also notable museums devoted to individual artists, including the Musée Picasso, the Musée Rodin and the Musée national Eugène Delacroix.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before, 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974, and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date.[139] Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, but it is much less than Île-de-France's 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire Île-de-France): the major part of the city's population is a rent-paying one.[139] Social or public housing represented 19.9 percent of the city's total residences in 2017. Its distribution varies widely throughout the city, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement, to 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement.[140]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to the 2020 Paris municipal election, each of Paris's 20 arrondissements had its own town hall and a directly elected council (*conseil d'arrondissement*), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor.[114] The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris and also members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. As of 1996, there were a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.[109] The creation of Paris Centre, a unified administrative division with a single mayor covering the first four arrondissements, took effect with the said 2020 election; the other 16 arrondissements continue to have their own mayors.[115]\n\n\n\n### Métropole du Grand Paris[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most prestigious sculptors who made their reputation in Paris in the modern era are Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi (Statue of Liberty), Auguste Rodin, Camille Claudel, Antoine Bourdelle, Paul Landowski (statue of *Christ the Redeemer* in Rio de Janeiro) and Aristide Maillol. The Golden Age of the School of Paris ended between the two world wars.\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of museums in Paris\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nParis is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport (the third-busiest airport in Europe) and Orly Airport.[11][12] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily;[13] it is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[14] Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 7.8 million visitors in 2022, keeping its position as the most-visited art museum in the world.[15] The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre Musée National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe and Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the inauguration of its first line in 1900, Paris's Métro network has grown to become the city's most widely used local transport system; today it carries about 5.23 million passengers daily[283] through 16 lines, 308 stations (391 stops) and 226.9 km (141.0 mi) of rails. Superimposed on this is a 'regional express network', the RER, whose five lines, 257 stops and 587 km (365 mi) of rails connect Paris to more distant parts of the urban area. In addition, the Paris region is served by a light rail network, the tramway. Opened since 1992 for its first line, thirteen lines are currently operational. The network is 164.4 kilometres (102.2 mi) long with 248 stations.\n\n\n\n#### Air[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls.[231] Patrons danced the bourrée to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a \"musette\") and often the vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy) in the cafés and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars,[232] anParis became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés.[233]\n\n\nParis is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city.[232] Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist Stéphane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.[234]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n173. **^** Burchardt, Marian; Michalowski, Ines (26 November 2014). *After Integration: Islam, Conviviality and Contentious Politics in Europe*.

The *Moulin Rouge* was opened in 1889 and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the *Folies Bergère*. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. Later, Olympia Paris presented Dalida, Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland and the Grateful Dead.\n\n\nThe Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier and Tino Rossi. Other famous Paris music halls include *Le Lido*, on the Champs-Élysées, opened in 1946; and the Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951.

The Paris Region had a GDP of €765 billion (US$1.064 trillion, PPP)[8] in 2021, the highest in the European Union.[9] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, in 2022, Paris was the city with the ninth-highest cost of living in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the First World War, Paris sometimes found itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns.[66] In the years after the war, known as *Les Années Folles*, Paris continued to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Eva Kotchever, Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin, Sidney Bechet[67] and Salvador Dalí.[68]\n\n\nIn the years after the peace conference, the city was also home to growing numbers of students and activists from French colonies and other Asian and African countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai and Léopold Sédar Senghor.[69]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Median income in Paris and its nearest departments in 2018 (high income in red, low income in yellow)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Blois (Loir-et-Cher)\n* Saint-Étienne (Loire)\n* Le Puy-en-Velay (Haute-Loire)\n* Nantes (Loire-Atlantique)\n* Orléans (Loiret)\n* Cahors (Lot)\n* Agen (Lot-et-Garonne)\n* Mende (Lozère)\n* Angers (Maine-et-Loire)\n* Saint-Lô (Manche)\n* Châlons-en-Champagne (Marne)\n* Chaumont (Haute-Marne)\n* Laval (Mayenne)\n* Nancy (Meurthe-et-Moselle)\n* Bar-le-Duc (Meuse)\n* Vannes (Morbihan)\n* Metz (Moselle)\n* Nevers (Nièvre)\n* Lille (Nord)\n* Beauvais (Oise)\n* Alençon (Orne)\n* Arras (Pas-de-Calais)\n* Clermont-Ferrand (Puy-de-Dôme)\n* Pau (Pyrénées-Atlantiques)\n* Tarbes (Hautes-Pyrénées)\n* Perpignan (Pyrénées-Orientales)\n* Strasbourg (Bas-Rhin)\n* Colmar (Haut-Rhin)\n* Lyon (Rhône)\n* Vesoul (Haute-Saône)\n* Mâcon (Saône-et-Loire)\n* Le Mans (Sarthe)\n* Chambéry (Savoie)\n* Annecy (Haute-Savoie)\n* Paris (Paris)\n* Rouen (Seine-Maritime)\n* Melun (Seine-et-Marne)\n* Versailles (Yvelines)\n* Niort (Deux-Sèvres)\n* Amiens (Somme)\n* Albi (Tarn)\n* Montauban (Tarn-et-Garonne)\n* Toulon (Var)\n* Avignon (Vaucluse)\n* La Roche-sur-Yon (Vendée)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hall, Peter; Pain, Kathy (2012). *The Polycentric Metropolis: Learning from Mega-City Regions in Europe*.

Miami is known as the \"Magic City\" for seemingly popping up overnight due to its young age and massive growth. The city itself is infamous for its drug war in the early 1980s and its outrun aesthetics.[152] It is also nicknamed the \"Capital of Latin America\" because of its high population of Spanish-speakers.[153][154]\n\n\nMiami has been the setting of numerous films and television shows, including *Miami Vice*, *Cocaine Cowboys*, *Burn Notice*, *Jane the Virgin*, *Scarface*, *The Birdcage*, *Ace Ventura: Pet Detective*, *The Golden Girls*, *2 Fast 2 Furious*, and *Dexter*. Several video games, including *Hotline Miami*, the Gameloft racing game *Asphalt Overdrive*, *Scarface: The World Is Yours*, and the fictional Vice City in several video games across the *Grand Theft Auto* series, most notably *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City*, is based on Miami.[155]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment and performing arts[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Non-Hispanic Black population of the city of Miami peaked in 1990 at almost 90,000 (making up nearly a quarter of the population of the city). Since then, though, the city's Non-Hispanic Black population has experienced a precipitous and steady decline. At the time of the most recent census in 2020, it was found to be 52,447, only 11.7% of the population. Reasons for this include high costs in areas such as Liberty City and Little Haiti, compounded with gentrification.[85][86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"General Population Characteristics FLORIDA 1980 Census of Population\" (PDF). *07553445v1chA-Cpt11sec1ch002.pdf*.

From 1970 to 2000, population growth in the city was stagnant, as Non-Hispanic White Miamians left and significant immigration from Latin America, particularly Cuba, made up the balance.[83][84] The city's Hispanic majority solidified itself in this period of time, and in 1985, the city elected its first Cuban-born mayor, Xavier Suarez.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2010, 1.9% of the population considered themselves to be of only American ancestry (regardless of race or ethnicity),[114][115] while 0.5% were of Arab ancestry, as of 2010[update].[114]\n\n\n\nReligion in the Miami Metro Area (2014)[116]\n\n\n\nProtestantism (39%)\nCatholicism (27%)\nMormonism (0.5%)\nEastern Orthodoxy (0.5%)\nJehovah's Witnesses (1%)\nOther Christian (1%)\nNo religion (21%)\nJudaism (9%)\nOther religion (1%)\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Christianity is the most-practiced religion in Miami (68%), with 39% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 27% professing Catholicism.[117][118] Followed by Judaism (9%); Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and a variety of other religions have smaller followings; atheism or no self-identifying organized religious affiliation was practiced by 21%.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n172. **^** \"Miami HEAT Team Homepage\". *HEAT.com*.

This caused them to begin to be outweighed by migration into the Downtown region (not only from Latin America, but also from the rest of the United States). This caused the Non-Hispanic White population to rise from a nadir of 11.8% at the time of the 2000 census to 11.9% at the time of the 2010 census. After this, the Non-Hispanic White population grew significantly faster than the city as a whole did during the 2010s, and by the time of the 2020 census, Non-Hispanic Whites made up 14.0% of the population of the city and numbered 61,829, the highest number since the 1980s.

From 1970 to 2000, population growth in the city was stagnant, as Non-Hispanic White Miamians left and significant immigration from Latin America, particularly Cuba, made up the balance.[83][84] The city's Hispanic majority solidified itself in this period of time, and in 1985, the city elected its first Cuban-born mayor, Xavier Suarez.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2010, 1.9% of the population considered themselves to be of only American ancestry (regardless of race or ethnicity),[114][115] while 0.5% were of Arab ancestry, as of 2010[update].[114]\n\n\n\nReligion in the Miami Metro Area (2014)[116]\n\n\n\nProtestantism (39%)\nCatholicism (27%)\nMormonism (0.5%)\nEastern Orthodoxy (0.5%)\nJehovah's Witnesses (1%)\nOther Christian (1%)\nNo religion (21%)\nJudaism (9%)\nOther religion (1%)\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Christianity is the most-practiced religion in Miami (68%), with 39% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 27% professing Catholicism.[117][118] Followed by Judaism (9%); Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and a variety of other religions have smaller followings; atheism or no self-identifying organized religious affiliation was practiced by 21%.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n172. **^** \"Miami HEAT Team Homepage\". *HEAT.com*.

This caused them to begin to be outweighed by migration into the Downtown region (not only from Latin America, but also from the rest of the United States). This caused the Non-Hispanic White population to rise from a nadir of 11.8% at the time of the 2000 census to 11.9% at the time of the 2010 census. After this, the Non-Hispanic White population grew significantly faster than the city as a whole did during the 2010s, and by the time of the 2020 census, Non-Hispanic Whites made up 14.0% of the population of the city and numbered 61,829, the highest number since the 1980s.

Located on the Atlantic Ocean, and with a long history as a seaport, Miami is also known for its seafood, with many seafood restaurants located along the Miami River and in and around Biscayne Bay.[163] The city is also the headquarters of restaurant chains such as Burger King and Benihana.\n\n\n\n### Dialect[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Miami accent\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ZIP Codes | 33101-33102, 33106, 33109, 33111-33112, 33114, 33116, 33119, 33122, 33124-33138, 33140-33147, 33149-33158, 33160-33170, 33172-33199, 33206, 33222, 33231, 33233-33234, 33238-33239, 33242-33243, 33245, 33247, 33255-33257, 33261, 33265-33266, 33269, 33280, 33283, 33296, 33299\n |\n| Area code(s) | 305, 786, 645 |\n| FIPS code | 12-45000 |\n| GNIS feature ID | 277593, 2411786 |\n| GDP (Miami-Dade County, 2021) | $155 billion[10] (14th) |\n| GMP (Metro, 2021) | $403 billion[11][12] (12th) |\n| Website | miamigov.com |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere has been a Norwegian Seamen's church in Miami since the early 1980s. In November 2011, Crown Princess of Norway Mette-Marit opened a new building for the church. The church was built as a center for the 10,000 Scandinavians that live in Florida. Around 4,000 of them are Norwegian. The church is also an important place for the 150 Norwegians that work at Walt Disney World in Central Florida.[119]\n\n\nAccording to the 2022 Point-In-Time Homeless Count, there were 3,440 homeless people in Miami-Dade County,[120] 970 of which were on the streets.

The city is located 300 km (186 mi) northwest of Buenos Aires, on the west bank of the Paraná River. Rosario is the third-most populous city in the country, and is also the most populous city in Argentina that is not a capital (provincial or national). With a growing and important metropolitan area, Greater Rosario has an estimated population of 1,750,000 as of 2020[update].[4][5] One of its main attractions includes the neoclassical, Art Nouveau,[6] and Art Deco architecture that has been retained over the centuries in hundreds of residences, houses and public buildings.\n\n\nRosario is the head city of the Rosario Department and is located at the heart of the major industrial corridor in Argentina. The city is a major railroad terminal and the shipping center for north-eastern Argentina. Ships reach the city via the Paraná River, which allows the existence of a 10-metre-deep (34 ft) port. The Port of Rosario is subject to silting and must be dredged periodically.[7] Exports include wheat, flour, hay, linseed and other vegetable oils, corn, sugar, lumber, meat, hides, and wool. Manufactured goods include flour, sugar, meat products, and other foodstuffs. The Rosario-Victoria Bridge, opened in 2004, spans the Paraná River, connecting Rosario with the city of Victoria, across the Paraná Delta. The city plays a critical role in agricultural commerce, and thus finds itself at the center of a continuing debate over taxes levied on big-ticket agricultural goods such as soy.\n\n\nAlong with Paraná, Rosario is one of the few Argentine cities that cannot point to a particular individual as its founder. The city's patron is the \"Virgin of the Rosary\", whose feast day is October 7.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Rosario\n\n### Early settlement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the city of Rosario c. 1877\n![](image)Rosario port area in 1888\nEven though the city did not have a clear foundation date or any official acknowledgement thereof, most commentators state that Rosario was founded on 7 October 1793 with a local population of 457 inhabitants.[8] Nonetheless, the town was officially declared a *city* on 3 August 1852, at the time it was known as ***Pago de los Arroyos***, that is, \"land of the streams\", a reference to the several small rivers that traverse the southern region of Santa Fe, like the Ludueña Stream, the Saladillo Stream and others, emptying into the Paraná River. In 1689, captain Luís Romero de Piñeda received part of the lands of the Pago de los Arroyos by royal decree, as payment for services to the Spanish Crown. Before that, the area was originally inhabited by various indigenous tribes, some of which lived in *reducciones*, a type of mission founded by Franciscans. These missions were ultimately attacked and destroyed by hostile tribes of the Chaco region.\n\n\nRomero de Piñeda established the first permanent settlement, an *estancia* — intended as farmland, not as a town. In 1719, the Jesuits bought another part and established *Estancia San Miguel*. The area was still so scarcely populated that it had no central authority; it was ruled from the provincial capital (Santa Fe), and in turn from Buenos Aires.\n\n\nIn 1724, another colonial settlement was initiated by Santiago de Montenegro, who set up a mill, drew plans for the future town, built a chapel, and was appointed mayor in 1751. The area of control of this local government extended northward from today's Rosario; only in 1784 was it divided into two smaller jurisdictions.\n\n\nOn February 27, 1812, General Manuel Belgrano raised the newly created Argentine flag on the shores of the Paraná, for the first time. Because of this, Rosario is known as the \"Cradle of the Argentine Flag\". The National Flag Memorial marks the occasion.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rosario's old Customs Office, on Belgrano Avenue\nThe province of Santa Fe suffered greatly from the civil war that afflicted Argentina after 1820. Demographic growth was relatively slow. During this period, Rosario was a small settlement and a stop on the way from the city of Santa Fe to Buenos Aires. In 1823, it was elevated to the category of \"village\" (*Ilustre y Fiel Villa del Rosario*). Charles Darwin travelled through the area in 1832 and described Rosario as \"a large town\" with about 2,000 residents. In 1841, a decree of the *caudillo* and Governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, banned navigation of the Paraná and Paraguay rivers to non-Argentine vessels, and thus shut off the Port of Rosario to foreign trade.\n\n\nOn 25 December 1851, a small group of locals and the military guard of the city declared their support for the rival *caudillo* Justo José de Urquiza. As a reward for their participation in the Battle of Caseros, triumphant Urquiza wrote to the governor of Santa Fe on 9 June 1852 asking for Rosario to be granted city status. Governor Domingo Crespo justified the request at the provincial legislative body, marking the geographically strategic position of the town for national and international trade, and on 5 August, Rosario was formally declared a city.\n\n\nUrquiza opened up the river for free international trade. The city's economy and population expanded at an accelerated rate. By 1880, Rosario had become the first export outlet of Argentina. During the last 15 years of the 19th century, the city more than doubled its population, in part due to immigration. By 1887 it had about 50,000 inhabitants, of whom 40% were European immigrants, who brought new ideas from Europe and began to turn Rosario into a politically progressive city (contrasting with the more conservative, aristocratic Santa Fe).\n\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, there was a movement promoting that the city of Rosario become the capital of the republic. Ovidio Lagos, founder of the oldest Argentine newspaper, *La Capital*, was one of the strongest proponents of this idea (one of the main avenues in Rosario now carries his name). Rosario was indeed declared the federal capital on three occasions, but each time the law was vetoed by the Executive Branch (once by Bartolomé Mitre and twice by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento). In 1911, the French-owned railway company Ferrocarril Rosario y Puerto Belgrano opened a line between Rosario and Puerto Belgrano, Argentina's main naval base. By 1926, Rosario had 407,000 inhabitants, 47% of them foreign, many coming from Europe in the wake of World War I.\n\n\n\n### Contemporary history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)National Flag Memorial, downtown Rosario\nIn 1969, workers and students took to the streets and organized strikes in what has been dubbed the \"Rosariazo\" against the dictatorship. A few years later, in 1976, the military dictatorship made hundreds of dissident citizens \"disappear\" in what is known as the Dirty War.\n\n\nIn 1983, Argentina returned to democratic rule, but in 1989, hyperinflation caused the economic collapse of the country. In Rosario there were riots and looting episodes. Under the Menem administration, the situation worsened as the industrial sector of the city was dismantled by foreign competition, and agricultural exports stagnated. In 1995, unemployment in the area reached 21.1% and a large part of Rosario's population fell below the poverty line.\n\n\nSince the recovery of the national economy that followed the 2001 collapse, Rosario's economic situation has improved. The boom in agricultural exports has caused a large increase in consumer spending and investment. The Socialist Party has won mayoral races in the city in every election since Councilman Héctor Cavallero's 1989 election. Cavallero's successor, Hermes Binner (elected in 1995), was elected Governor of Santa Fe in 2007 and became the runner-up in the 2011 presidential election on the FAP ticket. Mayor Miguel Lifschitz's administration, elected in 2007, took advantage of the economic boom to invest heavily in public works as well as in public health (which takes up about a quarter of the whole budget). Mayor Mónica Fein became, in 2011, the first Socialist woman elected mayor in Argentine history.[9]\n\n\nAfter the 1990s, Rosario became a major city of the illegal drug trade in Argentina, headed by a drug dealing family called \"Los Monos\" (\"The Monkeys\").[10] Early during 2018, it was estimated by national news sources that a turf war between local drug gangs (\"Los Funes\" and \"Los Camino\") was costing an average of one life every twenty five hours.[11][12]\n\n\n\n### Historical images\n[edit]\n\n\n* ![Mercado Sud (c.1903)](image)\n\nMercado Sud (c.1903)\n* ![Palace of Justice (c.1905)](image)\n\nPalace of Justice (c.1905)\n* ![Hotel Savoy (c.1910)](image)\n\nHotel Savoy (c.1910)\n* ![San Martín Square (c.1920s)](image)\n\nSan Martín Square (c.1920s)\n* ![Hipólito Yrigoyen on a train during an electoral campaign (1926)](image)\n\nHipólito Yrigoyen on a train during an electoral campaign (1926)\n* ![Inauguration of the National Flag Memorial (1957)](image)\n\nInauguration of the National Flag Memorial (1957)\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Government of Rosario\n\n![](image)*Palacio de los Leones* (City Hall)\nRosario is ruled by an executive branch represented by a mayor (seat: Palacio de los Leones), and a legislative branch, consisting of a Deliberative Council (seat: Palacio Vassallo). The mayor is elected for a four-year term, and the Council renews half of its 21 members every two years.\n\n\n\n### Municipal Centre District (CMD)[edit]\n\n\nSince 1997, a municipal program of decentralization of legislative activities was carried out, materialized in 6 Municipal Centres of District (Centre, North, South, West, Northwest and Southwest).\n\n\nThe city is divided into six large administrative districts (Center, North, Northwest, West, Southwest, and South), with Municipal District Centers that provide services to the population.\n\n\nFor years, local people and institutions have been pushing the provincial government to grant Rosario the status of Autonomous City. Some, with the sponsorship of the governors of Santa Fe, Entre Ríos and Córdoba as well as other important politicians, have put forward a legislative project to move the National Congress to Rosario, to decentralize the national government.[13]\n\n\nSince the return to democracy in 1983, the mayors of Rosario were Horacio Usandizaga, Héctor Cavallero (standing in for Usandizaga, then re-elected), Hermes Binner (re-elected once), Miguel Lifschitz (re-elected once), and, since December 2011 to December 2019, Mónica Fein. Currently, the mayor is Pablo Javkin, whose term lasts from December 2019 to 2023. From Cavallero on (1989), the mayor has been a member of the Socialist Party, since December 2019, Rosario's mayor is from a different political party, ending more than 30 years of socialism.\n\n\nThe city does not have a police force of its own (it is served by the provincial police), but in 2004 it pioneered the creation of a special patrol force of unarmed officers called *Guardia Urbana Municipal* (\"Municipal Urban Guard\"), which was later used as a model for Buenos Aires and other cities.\n\n\n\n![](image)*Parroquia del Perpetuo Socorro*, a church at Lisandro de la Torre district\n### Municipal statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe municipality of Rosario comprises 178.69 square kilometres (69.0 sq mi), of which 117.2 km2 (45 sq mi) are urbanized, in 6,306 housing blocks. Of this area, 9.3 km2 (3.6 sq mi), 5.3% is devoted to green spaces (parks, boulevards, plazas), which gives over 10 m2 of green space per inhabitant.\n\n\nElectric power is supplied to the whole urban area and running water reaches 97% of the population (about 350,000 homes). Natural gas is provided to 227,152 homes.[14]\n\n\nWith the recovery of the national economy since 2002, the city experienced a real-estate boom. In the period 2003–2006, the construction sector added 2 million m2, investing about $900 million. Despite this increased supply, both price and rent have increased sharply compared to the values during the 1990s.\n\n\nAccording to experts, this growth was propelled by the increased purchasing power of farmers around Rosario, helped by competitive exports, and the overall preference for safer investment options.[15]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nRosario has several public health centers: five municipal hospitals (including a children's hospital and an emergency hospital/trauma center) and a municipal outpatient-only center, plus two large provincial hospitals (Hospital Provincial and Hospital Centenario), and their associated primary care centers in the city proper and its metropolitan area.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Argentina\n\n![](image)Bolsa de Comercio Rosario: The Rosario Stock Exchange\nRosario is the centre of a metropolitan region whose economy is based on services and industry, generating the second-largest urban gross regional product of Argentina, after Greater Buenos Aires.[*citation needed*][16] The principal manufacturing sector is the agro industry, whose industries are placed in the northern and southern areas of Greater Rosario; the investments over the last decade have transformed Rosario into a major role of processing oil of the world[17] Many other sectors contribute to the diversified industrial offerings of the city. Rosario and its metropolitan area produce 20% of the cars, 4% of the domestic refrigerators, 80% of the machinery for the food industry and 100% of the auto bodies for long-distance buses made in Argentina.\n\n\nOther important sectors include the petrochemical sector, with three plants located in the suburbs of San Lorenzo and Port San Martin; the chemistry sector, with plants for sulphuric acid, fertilizers, resins and other products; the cellulose industry; the meat industry; ironworks; auto parts; the plants and equipment for bottled oil; agricultural machinery; and the materials and equipment for the construction industry.\nWorldwide international companies settled in Rosario include, among others, General Motors, Cargill, Unilever, John Deere, Petrobrás, ICI, Dow, Tenneco and Mahle.\n\n\nThe main financial bank at the city of Rosario is the Municipal Bank of Rosario. Its central offices are located in the financial district, on San Martín St., and there are several additional offices throughout the city. It is focused on small and medium enterprises and other organizations, especially through micro credits, and may be considered an \"ethical bank.\"[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wood chips carrier Racer on the Paraná River, just coming under the Rosario-Victoria Bridge\nThe Municipal Bank was founded in 1896 to support the financial needs of the citizens and small businesses in the highly productive region of southern Santa Fe Province, centered in Rosario. At the time, the city had around 92,000 inhabitants and was already the most important port on the Paraná River. The idea of creating a municipal financial institution was expressed in 1893 by Mayor Floduardo Grandoli, citing the proliferation of \"centers of usury\" that exploited those in need of credit, especially the poor (something not addressed by the profile of the Provincial Bank of Santa Fe, which granted loans only to demonstrably solvent persons). Acting on this, the municipal Counseling Commission passed a bill (on 1 February 1895) dictating an \"Organic Charter of the Municipal Bank of Loans and Savings Accounts;\" the bank opened exactly one year later.\n\n\nThe seat of the bank was moved in 1905. Its name was changed to its present form on 14 May 1940 by a municipal bill. Its location was moved again, for the last time so far, in 1986. Following some political controversy, the bank in 2006 was capitalized by the municipality to comply with new regulations dictated by the Central Bank, and transformed into a joint stock company, with only 1% of the stock belonging to the municipal state. A special clause was added, dictating that this minimum share is unchangeable, to prevent hypothetical attempts at privatization.[19]\n\n\nThe Rosario Board of Trade hosts the country's largest commodity market, dealing in cereals and oilseeds, and also the largest futures exchange (ROFEX). The banking sector includes the state-owned Municipal Bank of Rosario, with branches and offices throughout the city, and the central branch of the New Bank of Santa Fe.\n\n\nThe largest technological center in Argentina – Polo Tecnológico Rosario (PTR) – is located in Rosario within La Siberia site. The center focuses mainly on research and development of the three following areas: biotechnology, software development, and telecommunications. It currently employs 3,500 people, and it is expected to grow 100% by 2015 to become one of the largest in Latin America.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nRosario has many cultural activities in many artistic disciplines with national and international reach. The city has produced important personalities in the fields of music, painting, philosophy, politics, poetry, literature, medicine, and law. Among the city's important theaters are El Círculo, Sala Lavardén, Broadway, Astengo Auditorium, and La Comedia. A cultural complex known as Puerto de la Música,[20] designed by the modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer (of Brasilia fame), is to be built along the banks of the Paraná River. If completed, it will be one of the largest centers for musical performance in Latin America. In 2012, after years without progress, it was put on indefinite hold due to financial constraints. January 1995 saw the launch of the Rosario District Fishing Championship, held in the Parana River. Three years later, in 1998, a 10-year-old Lionel Messi was crowned Junior Champion.\n\n\nThe city has several museums, including Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum, Firma y Odilo Estévez Municipal Decorative Art Museum, Dr. Julio Marc Provincial Historical Museum, City Museum, and Museum of Contemporary Art of Rosario (MACRo). The Dr. Ángel Gallardo Provincial Natural Sciences Museum was rebuilt after a fire in 2003 and re-opened at a new location in 2006. Rosario also has a public astronomy complex, located in Urquiza Park, which consists of an observatory (inaugurated in 1970) and a planetarium (1984).\n\n\nThe Fundación Italia is a cultural institution created in 1985 as a \"cultural bond with Italy\". It has organized a Neapolitan music concert, performances of *Madame Butterfly* and numerous talks about the present and future of Argentina. Among the people invited to give these talks were economists Domingo Cavallo and Alfonso Prat Gay, renowned scholars Beatriz Sarlo and Silvia Bleichmar, journalists Alejandro Rozitchner and Jorge Asís, filmmaker Fernando Solanas and former presidents of Chile (Ricardo Lagos), Argentina (Eduardo Duhalde), and Uruguay (Luis Alberto Lacalle Herrera).\n\n\n\n![](image)*El Círculo* Theatre\n![](image)Planetarium of Rosario\n![](image)Museum of Contemporary Art of Rosario\n![](image)Municipal Museum of Rosario\n### Cultural centers[edit]\n\n\n* Centro Cultural Roberto Fontanarrosa\n* Centro Popular de la Memoria\n* Centro Cultural Islas Malvinas\n* Centro Cultural Estación Provincial\n* Grupo Pasajes\n* Centro de Cultura & Comunicación\n* Centro Cultural El Núcleo\n* Centro Cultural Los Hornos\n\n\n### Theaters[edit]\n\n\n* Teatro El Círculo\n* Teatro La Comedia\n* Teatro Auditorio Fundación\n* Teatro Sala Lavardén\n* Teatro Puerto de la Música\n* Teatro Municipal Coliseo Podestá\n* Anfiteatro Martín Fierro\n* Teatro La Nonna\n* Teatro La Hermandad del Princesa\n* Sala 420\n* Taller de Teatro de la UNLP\n* Complejo \"El Teatro\"\n* Teatro \"La Lechuza\"\n* Teatro vorterix\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\n* Dr. Julio Marc Provincial Historical Museum\n* Dr. Ángel Gallardo Provincial Natural Sciences Museum\n* Firma y Odilo Estévez Municipal Decorative Art Museum\n* Juan B.

It has the office of the Administration and the boxes for journalists.\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n* Biblioteca Argentina Dr. Juan Álvarez[22]\n* Biblioteca Central General José de San Martín\n* Biblioteca Municipal Francisco López Merino\n* Biblioteca de la Legislatura de la Provincia\n* Biblioteca Pedagógica Eudoro Díaz\n\n\n### Landmarks[edit]\n\n\n#### National Flag Memorial[edit]\n\n\nMain article: National Flag Memorial (Argentina)\n\n![](image)Argentine Flag Memorial\n![](image)The Propylaeum (column gallery) of the National Argentine Flag Memorial\n![](image)The Flag Memorial at night\n![](image)Rosario seen from the Flag Memorial\nThe National Flag Memorial in Rosario is a monumental complex built near the banks of the Paraná River. It was commissioned in 1944 and inaugurated on June 20, 1957 – the anniversary of the death of Manuel Belgrano, creator of the Argentine flag, who raised it for the first time on an island in the river on February 27, 1812.\n\n\nThe complex has a total area of about 10,000 m2 (107,600 sq ft) and was constructed using stone primarily sourced in the Andes. The structure was designed by the architects Ángel Guido and Alejandro Bustillo, and the monument was adorned with works by sculptors Lola Mora, Eduardo Barnes, Alfredo Bigatti, and José Fioravanti.[23][24]\n\n\nThe Memorial (Monumento) has three parts: the Tower (Torre) or mast, 70 metres (230 ft) high, which commemorates the Revolution of May 1810 and houses Manuel Belgrano's crypt in its base; the Civic Courtyard (Patio Cívico), which symbolizes the effort of the organization of the state (the Courtyard is used for massive open-air shows), and the Triumphal Propylaeum (Propileo Triunfal), representing the nation as organized after the 1853 Constitution. Under the Propylaeum there is the Honor Room for the Flags of America (where the flags of all American nations are displayed).\n\n\nThe complex faces Belgrano Avenue, and is delimited by Córdoba and Santa Fe Streets, the latter of which slopes down towards the river at this point. The Propylaeum can be accessed from the pedestrian passage called Pasaje Juramento (\"Oath Passage\"), which starts at Buenos Aires St. between the municipal building (Palacio de los Leones) and the Cathedral, in front of Plaza 25 de Mayo (May 25 Square). Statues flank the passage by famous sculptor Lola Mora.\n\n\nThe Memorial and the National Flag Park located in front of it are the seat of the main celebrations of Flag Day on June 20. The 50th anniversary of the inauguration of the complex, in 2007, was marked by a special celebration and by the unveiling of a new lighting system.\n[25] El Puerto de la Música will be a theater with a total capacity of 30,000 people located by the Paraná River.\n\n\nArchitect Oscar Niemeyer came up with the concept by expanding the show from inside the theater to a much larger outside audience. The concrete curvilinear shape building with an area of 215,278 sq ft (20,000.0 m2) is the first design of Oscar Niemeyer in Argentina.[26] The project will be a distinctive part of Rosario's skyline. Construction will begin at the end of 2010 and is expected to be completed by 2014.\n\n\n\n#### Planetarium[edit]\n\n\nLocated in Urquiza Park, Rosario's Municipal Astronomical Complex is one of the principal astronomical centers of the region.\n\n\nThe planetarium has a core team, together with its secondary elements, providing an artificial image of the sky through projections made on a fixed hemispherical dome that functions as a display.\n\n\nThe assembly is installed in the Room \"Oscar Claudio Caprile\", located in the heart of the magnificent building that is shaped like a comet.\n\n\nFor its technical characteristics in terms of size, quality of sound and image, and interior comfort, this room is considered among the best in the world.\n\n\nThe building in the shape of a comet forms a part of the complex that includes the \"Prof. Victor Capolongo\" observatory and the experimental science museum.\n\n\n\n##### The observatory[edit]\n\n\nMunicipal Astronomical Observatory \"Prof. Victor Capolongo\" was inaugurated on June 18, 1970, and named its first director.\n\n\nThe Observatory facilitates outreach, teaching, and research in the field of astronomy and related sciences and informs the public of phenomena that occur in the sky, such as eclipses, planetary configurations, passages of comets, etc.\n\n\nTo that end, the Observatory has installed two telescopes. One Coudé refractor has a 150 mm (5.9 in) aperture and 2,250 mm (88.6 in) focal distance provided with Lyot's monochromatic filter for solar observation. Another Cassegrain reflector has 300 mm (11.8 in) aperture, constructed by the Carl Zeiss company.\n\n\nThere are realized observations and astronomical photography of all the visible celestial objects in Rosario's sky, according to time of year and especially the Sun, the Moon, and the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, and Venus.\n\n\nThe asteroid 14812 Rosario was named in the city's honor as a result.[27]\n\n\n\n##### Experimental Science Museum[edit]\n\n\nThis museum was inaugurated on September 24, 1987. It is the first in Argentina and differs from traditional museums, in that it has equipment and instruments to demonstrate the laws of nature, which can be interactively used by the general public.\n\n\nThus, visitors of all ages can use telescopes and microscopes or experiment with lasers, sound mixers, radios of various types, computers, solar cells, etc.\n\n\nTo complement this, exhibit panels have photographs and explanatory texts of science and technology: mathematics and computer science, engineering, physics, astronomy, astronautics, geology, chemistry, and biology. In addition, an important area is intended for periodic samples, such as the Space Age, energy: renewable and rational use, from sand to glass, among others. The museum staff is supported by contributions from the Ministry of Science and Technology Office, the Municipality of Rosario, and the contributions made by institutions and individuals.\n\n\nThe museum audiovisual projections are made in the Video Sector Science, which has an area called \"CIENCIANIÑO\" (ChildScience) for children aged 4 to 10. The museum works in the evening, similar to the Planetarium. Educational institutions at all levels are treated in shift assignments.\n\n\n\n#### Statue of Che Guevara[edit]\n\n\nThe 4-metre-tall bronze statue of Che Guevara was unveiled on 14 June 2008[28] to commemorate the 80th anniversary of his birth. It is made from 75,000 bronze keys donated by Argentines nationwide[28] and weighs 2.7 tons. The statue was made by artist Andrés Zerneri and is the first such monument to Guevara in his native Argentina.[29]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Argentina\n\n### Demographic distribution[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1858 | 9,785 | —     |\n| 1869 | 23,169 | +136.8% |\n| 1887 | 50,914 | +119.8% |\n| 1900 | 112,462 | +120.9% |\n| 1910 | 192,278 | +71.0% |\n| 1926 | 407,354 | +111.9% |\n| 1947 | 584,587 | +43.5% |\n| 1960 | 669,173 | +14.5% |\n| 1970 | 806,942 | +20.6% |\n| 1980 | 956,761 | +18.6% |\n| 1991 | 1,118,905 | +16.9% |\n| 2001 | 1,161,188 | +3.8% |\n| 2010 | 1,193,605 | +2.8% |\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of the Municipal Districts of Rosario, Centre District, North District, Northwest District, West District, Southwest District and South District\nRosario is located in the Province of Santa Fe, Argentina. This metropolis has a population of about 1.2 million (1,159,004 est.), thus being Argentina's third most populated urban settlement, after Córdoba.[30] Greater Rosario comprises Rosario itself (population about 910,000) and a large area around it, spreading in all directions except eastward (because of the Paraná River). Directly to the south, it includes the city of Villa Gobernador Gálvez, with a population of about 75,000, about 10 km (6.2 mi) from Rosario city center.\n\n\nTo the west and south-west there are several smaller towns and cities (Funes, Roldán, Pérez, Soldini); Roldán is 23 km (14 mi) from the Rosario city centre. These settlements were incorporated into the metropolis due to their vicinity to major roads leading into Rosario, and many people living there habitually commute to Rosario.\n\n\nThe farthest end is to the north, following the coast of the river; from Rosario, one finds, in succession and usually merging into each other, the towns of Granadero Baigorria, Capitán Bermúdez, Fray Luis Beltrán, San Lorenzo (already in a different *departamento*, with a population of over 40,000), and Puerto General San Martín, the last being at a distance of 35 km (22 mi) from Rosario.\n\n\nThe north of the Greater Rosario is one end of an area traditionally called *Cordón Industrial* (\"Industrial Corridor\"), since it was traditionally a heavily industrialized productive region. The prelude to the economic crisis in the 1990s largely dismantled the industrial infrastructure and damaged agricultural exports. These sectors were largely revitalized by 2006 as the national economy continued to recover, but high levels of poverty and unemployment persist in the city's western neighborhoods (official surveys indicated that in 2011, 6.5% of the metro area population was under the poverty line; and that in 2012, 8.3% of the labor force was unemployed).[5][31]\n\n\nIn 1876 the total population was 203,509; by 1926, Rosario had 407,000 inhabitants, 47% of them foreign, many having arrived from Europe in the wake of World War I. Most of these were Italian, and among them, a majority from the north-western region of Liguria.\n\n\nAs of the 2010 Census, there were 1,193,605 people residing in the city and 31 surrounding districts, making Greater Rosario the third-largest metro area in Argentina even as its population growth has leveled off.[3] The population density in Rosario proper was 6,680 inhabitants per square kilometer (17,300 inhabitants/sq mi); but, only about 2,400/km2 (6,200/sq mi) in the suburbs.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Club Español de Rosario*, club of the Spanish community in Rosario\nThe 2010 Census also showed a relatively aged population. With 21% under the age of fifteen and 17% over sixty, the people have an age structure similar to those in many North American cities. They are, likewise, more elderly on average than Argentines as a whole (of whom 25% were under 15 and 14%, over 60).[3]\n\n\nThe ethnic make-up of Rosario changed in the late 19th century, when significant numbers of European immigrants arrived in the city. Prior to this the city's population had been almost completely European-descent in ethnic origin. As Buenos Aires was the first landfall in Argentina for many migrant ships coming from Europe in the 1850s and 1890s, Rosario started to experience a diverse influx of people.[*citation needed*] The main contributors were Spain, Italy, France, Croatia, Poland, Russia, Romania, Ukraine, the Balkans (especially Greece, Serbia and Montenegro), Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Scandinavia (especially Sweden). By the 1910s, 43 percent of the city population was non-native Argentine after immigration rates peaked.[33][34]\n\n\nMost immigrants, regardless of origin, settled in the city or around Greater Rosario. However, in the first stages of immigration, some formed colonies (especially agricultural colonies) in different parts of the city, often encouraged by the Argentine government and/or sponsored by private individuals and organizations.\n\n\nChristianity is the dominant faith with Roman Catholicism as the most practiced, followed by Protestantism. Judaism is the second-most professed religion in the city as Rosario has one of the largest Jewish communities in Argentina. There is also a local Islamic society.[35]\n\n\n\n### Districts[edit]\n\n\nRosario is divided into six districts, most named by location, although the easternmost is called *Centre District* for it includes the oldest part of the city, historically called *Centro* (City Centre). The data given below are from the 2001 census [INDEC].\n\n\n\n![](image)Villa Hortensia, the seat of the North District\n![](image)Seat of the Center District, at the former Rosario Central railway station\nCentre District\nPopulation: 261,047   Area: 20.37 km2 (11.45% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 12,815 inhab/km2   Housing: 110,152 units\n\n\n\nNorth District\nPopulation: 131,495   Area: 35.02 km2 (19.6% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 3,744 inhab/km2   Housing: 40,492 units\n\n\n\nNorthwest District\nPopulation: 144,461   Area: 44.14 km2 (24.7% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 3,273 inhab/km2   Housing: 41,740 units\n\n\n\nWest District\nPopulation: 106,356   Area: 40.21 km2 (22.5% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 2,645 inhab/km2   Housing: 31,625 units\n\n\n\nSouthwest District\nPopulation: 103,446   Area: 20.19 km2 (11.3% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 5,123 inhab/km2   Housing: 28,284 units\n\n\n\nSouth District\nPopulation: 160,771   Area: 18.76 km2 (10.5% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 8,569 inhab/km2   Housing: 48,541 units\n\n\n\n## Urban structure[edit]\n\n\n### Centre District[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nDowntown Rosario has many bars and cafés.\n![](image)\nThe central offices of the Municipal Bank of Rosario, as pictured in 2006\n\nAt Rosario city center, Córdoba Street is the main avenue. It begins at the Flag Memorial Park, climbs towards the district area, and becomes a pedestrian walk for seven blocks, between Plaza 25 de Mayo and Plaza Pringles. Along Córdoba Ave to the west *Paseo del Siglo* (\"Walk of the Century\") was settled, with former houses of wealthy families, finally there is also the *San Martín Square*, and elsewhere, *Plaza Montenegro* (on *Peatonal San Martín*, the pedestrian-only four blocks of San Martín Street) and *Plaza Sarmiento*.\n\n\nOroño Boulevard (going north–south) and Pellegrini Avenue (east-west) mark the boundaries of the town center together with the river. At their confluence starts the Parque de la Independencia, that houses the Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum, the Newell's Old Boys football club, and the sports clubs *Provincial* and *Gimnasia y Esgrima*, as well as the horse racetrack and the former *Sociedad Rural* (Rural Society).\n\n\nTowards the south, beyond Pellegrini Avenue, there are two more boulevards, 27 de Febrero and Seguí, and avenues Uriburu, Arijón and Battle y Ordóñez.\nTo the west, after Oroño, there are the avenues Ovidio Lagos and Francia, Avellaneda Boulevard and Provincias Unidas Avenue. The main *barrios* in the south are La Tablada, Parque Casado, Las Heras, Las Delicias and Las Flores. The city ends in the Saladillo Stream.\n\n\nAmong the districts in the west are Echesortu, Belgrano, Triángulo, Moderno, Godoy and Fisherton. To the north-east there lie Pichincha, Ludueña, Lisandro de la Torre (home of Rosario Central's stadium) and Empalme Graneros.\n\n\n\n![](image)Night view of the luxury Dolfines Guaraní Towers, May 2010\nNext to the stadium, there is the Parque Alem, and nearby the Sorrento thermal power plant. To the north lie the districts of Alberdi, La Florida (with a popular beach resort of the same name), Parque Field (built under US President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress development plans) and Rucci. The main streets are Alberdi Avenue and its continuation, Rondeau Boulevard (which leads to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge and the city of Granadero Baigorria). These are crossed by the avenues Las Tres Vías, Génova, Sorrento, and Puccio.\n\n\nAn important part of Rosario's urban character is its riverbank. The city recovered the riverbank of the Paraná not long ago, thanks to a reorganization of terrains formerly owned by the port and the national railroad system. Going from the center immediately north of the port, the riverbank is surrounded by a large number of parks; Argentine flag Memorial, Parque de España, Parque de las Colectividades and Parque Sunchales.\n\n\n\n### Greater Rosario[edit]\n\n\nThrough the years, Rosario has spread in all directions. Towards the south, beyond Pellegrini, there are two more boulevards, 27 de Febrero and Seguí, and avenues Uriburu, Arijón and Battle y Ordóñez.To the west, after Oroño, there are the avenues Ovidio Lagos and Francia, Avellaneda Boulevard and Provincias Unidas Avenue. The main neighborhoods in the south are La Tablada, Parque Casado, Las Heras, Las Delicias and Las Flores. The city ends in the Saladillo Stream (the natural border with Villa Gobernador Gálvez). This is just south of the great barrio Grandoli.\n\n\nAmong the neighborhoods in the west are Echesortu, Belgrano, Triángulo, Moderno, Godoy, and Fisherton (near the west end of the city, formerly the home of hierarchical personnel of English railroad companies established in Rosario).\nTo the north-east there lie the neighborhoods of Pichincha (a red-light district in the early 20th century, now home to an open-air antiquities fair: *Mercado de antigüedades \"Feria Retro La Huella\"*), Ludueña, Lisandro de la Torre (home of the Rosario Central football club) and Empalme Graneros; these last three are in the influence area of the Ludueña Stream, now contained by underground piping, but until the 1980s a source of floods.\n\n\nNext to the Rosario Central stadium, there is a large park, Parque Alem, and not far from it, there stands the Sorrento thermoelectric power plant. North of the Lisandro de la Torre neighborhood, there are Alberdi (formerly an independent town), La Florida (with a popular beach resort of the same name), and Rucci.\n\n\nThe main streets in the north are Alberdi Avenue and its continuation, Rondeau Boulevard (which leads to the north exit of the city, the access to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge, and the town of Granadero Baigorria). These major arteries are crossed by several avenues: Las Tres Vías, Génova, Sorrento, and Puccio.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nRosario's strategic location is destined to become a significant transportation hub and as the bi-oceanic corridor that links the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), an important component in global distribution and the core center of a key corridor in the Mercosur, the Common Market for the South.[36]\n\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Rosario, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 50 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 19% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.3 km, while 4% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.[37]\n\n\n\n### Road transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Front entrance and clock tower of the Mariano Moreno Bus Terminal in Rosario\n![](image)Trolleybus in the city centre\n![](image)The city had a tramway network until 1963.\nThe Rosario public transport system includes buses, trolleybuses and taxicabs.\n\n\nThe Rosario trolleybus system consists of only one main trunk line. It is presently operated by a government-owned corporation, SEMTUR (Sociedad del Estado Municipal para el Transporte Urbano de Rosario, \"Municipal State Society for Rosario Urban Transport\"), as are some of Rosario's other urban bus lines.\n\n\nPlaza Sarmiento is the hub of the city bus system, about 40 urban lines in the metropolitan area that provide service every 5 to 10 minutes.\n\n\nBus fares are pre-paid by means of either a rechargeable plastic card or a disposable paper card with a magnetic stripe which can be bought from post offices, automatic vending machines, and private businesses. For occasional use, a larger fare can be paid using a coin machine in the bus unit. The interurban lines have differential fares, and some allow payment in cash only. The municipal administration is phasing out the paper cards, in favor of the plastic ones, during the second half of 2012.\n\n\nThe urban bus fleet was partially renewed during the recovery of the national economy, since 2003, and consists of about 730 units. In 2005 the average age of the buses was five years and 11 months. Improvements in the economy have led to increased use of public transport and comparatively less use of bicycles. According to the Rosario Transportation Office, in 2005 there were about 11 million bus journeys per month,[38] by 2007, usage has climbed to 420,000 people every day (12.6 million per month).\n\n\nA significant number of buses run on natural gas, as it also happens in Argentina as a whole since the price of this fuel is quite low compared to the alternatives. The idea to transform all buses to this system did not prosper; most buses run on heavily subsidized diesel fuel.\n\n\nIn 2012 bus lanes were added to several pairs of parallel streets traversing the downtown area.[1] Bus stops along these are spaced every three blocks instead of the usual two. For the most part, they leave room to only one additional, narrow lane on the left for cars and other vehicles. They can be used for taxis carrying passengers as well. They are exclusive for public transport during weekdays and on Saturday morning; stopping or parking on the affected streets is forbidden, as well as right turns. Their implementation attracted opposition from residents and shop owners but was well received by habitual bus users since they reduce the time needed to get out of the crowded central area by a noticeable amount.[39]\n\n\nRosario has a medium-sized taxi fleet, with units painted black and outlined in yellow. Some belong to radio-taxi companies and can be reserved by telephone; others only in the streets. As the economy of Argentina recovers, the capacity of the taxi fleet has been strained by higher usage. In September 2005, the Deliberative Council approved the compulsory installation of radio-call systems in all taxi units, but this requirement has not been fulfilled.\n\n\nRosario is also a major hub for long-distance overland transportation from the Mariano Moreno Bus Terminal,[40] (*Terminal de Omnibus*), across from the Patio de la Madera Convention and Exposition Centre complex, about 15 blocks west of Plaza San Martin.\nThe transportation facility serves 73 bus companies in short, medium, and long-distance travel, carrying 1,100.000 passengers per month to 784 national and international destinations, which comprise most major domestic cities including Puerto Iguazú, Salta and Bariloche and international destinations such as Asunción, Paraguay, Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Montevideo, Uruguay, destinations may be long but white-clad chauffeurs handle comfortable long-distance coaches with modern conveniences.\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nuevo Central Argentino (NCA) freight railway yards\n![](image)Rosario Sur Station, refurbished to run inter-city services on the General Mitre Railway\n![](image)Rosario Norte\n![](image)The Center Municipal District (former Rosario Central station)\nRosario was one of the main cities chosen by the British and French railway companies that built and operated some of the railways in Argentina during the 19th and early 20th centuries, with more than 15 stations operating in the city. When the entire Argentine railway network was nationalised during the presidency of Juan Perón, most of the stations (by then under the administration of State-owned company Ferrocarriles Argentinos) were closed for passenger services to reduce costs, leaving only a few active.\n\n\nAfter the railway privatization in the early 1990s during Carlos Menem's presidency, the passenger services were considerably reduced. The lines operated by Nuevo Central Argentino (NCA) handle most of the cargo. Additionally, two private companies provided limited passenger services to several major cities. Trenes de Buenos Aires (TBA) ran weekly trains south to Retiro in Buenos Aires and north to Santa Fe. The company Ferrocentral also operated weekly trains south to Buenos Aires and northwest to Córdoba and Tucumán.\n\n\nNowadays, passenger services to Rosario are being operated by state-owned company Trenes Argentinos, running trains to Rosario Norte[41] with stop in Rosario Sur.\n\n\nThe other station in the main district, Rosario Oeste, used to concentrate all the passenger services when railways were nationalised in 1948, but currently operates for freight trains only.\n\n\nAs of June 2021, only two stations remain active for passenger services in the city. The following chart describes the total of existing railway stations in Rosario:\n\n\n\n\n\n**Railway stations in Rosario**\n| Station\n | Original company\n | Nationalised\n | Status (passenger)\n | Current operator\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rosario | Córdoba and Rosario | Belgrano | Closed (1949) [note 1] | —\n |\n| Rosario Central | Central Argentine | Mitre | Closed (1977) [note 2] | —\n |\n| Rosario Norte [note 3] | BA & Rosario | Mitre | Active | Trenes Argentinos / NCA |\n| Rosario Oeste | Córdoba Central | Belgrano | Closed (1993) | Trenes Argentinos CyL |\n| Rosario | Santa Fe Western | Mitre | Closed (1900) [note 4] | —\n |\n| Rosario | Prov.

The network is currently in the bidding process, with large firms like Siemens and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China bidding for its construction.[51] It is expected to begin at the recently inaugurated Rosario Sur Station and run northwards through the city.[52]\n\n\n\n### Roadways[edit]\n\n\nRosario is linked to the rest of the country by a number of roads: the Aramburu Highway (southeast, to Buenos Aires), National Route 9 (from Buenos Aires to Rosario and then north and west up to Jujuy and Bolivia), the Brigadier Estanislao López Highway (north, to Santa Fe City), National Route 11 (to the north of Santa Fe, Formosa and Paraguay), National Route 33 (to the southwest of Santa Fe and the province of Buenos Aires, and then through National Route 7 to San Luis, Mendoza and Chile), National Route 34 (north to Santiago del Estero, Tucumán and Bolivia), and National Route 174 (east, to Entre Ríos, over the Rosario-Victoria Bridge).\n\n\nIt is surrounded with an extensive system of two belt-highways called Circunvalación Motorway and A012 which in turn set the limits of the city.\n\n\nThe beltway is 30 km (19 mi) and was built for traffic to avoid the congested city centre, allowing drivers to bypass the city going around it in a much shorter time.\nIn its 30-kilometre (19 mi) length, it intersects with National Route 9, National Route 3, National Route 34, National Route 11 and National Route 174.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rosario-Victoria Bridge\nThe official numbering system denotes this road as \"A008\" but this denomination is mostly unknown by the locals as it is still called \"*Avenida de Circunvalación 25 de Mayo*\" (\"*25 of May Beltway Avenue*\") commemorating the May Revolution of 1810. Some sections are named after different personalities by local decree. For example:\n\n\n\n* The section from the east end on 27 Boulevard to the crossing of Ayacucho Street (old exit to the Rosario-Buenos Aires Highway, now access to Provincial Route 21), is called *\"National Route A008 Tte. General Juan Carlos Sánchez\"* by decree #232 of 14 May 1981.\n* The section between National Route 9 and the exit to Santa Fe (the state capital) National Route 11 on the intersection with Rondeau Boulevard is called *\"National Route A008 Dr. Constantino Razzetti\"* by law #25769 of 1 September 2003.\n\n\nThe A012 is the second beltway at the southeast of the city. It has a semi-circular length centered around the city, running as a long-length beltway. From the National Route 9 junction on km marker 278, in the town of Esther, to the junction with National Route 11 on km marker 326 in the city of San Lorenzo it runs for 67 km (41.6 mi).\n\n\nThis road is popularly known as the *Second Rosario Beltway*, as it borders the metropolitan area of greater Rosario.\nThrough National Decree 1595 of 1979[53] this road switched to federal control. Beforehand this road was called Provincial Route 16.\n\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rosario International Airport\n\n![](image)Rosario International Airport\nThe Rosario – Islas Malvinas International Airport is located 13 km (8 mi) west-northwest from the center of Rosario, a city in the Santa Fe Province of Argentina. The city of Funes lies directly to the west of the airport, and part of the city limit shares a border with the property of the airport grounds. The airport covers an area of 550 hectares (1,400 acres) and is operated by the Province of Santa Fe.[54][55]\n\n\nThe airport serves the Greater Rosario area and is the main hub for Sol Líneas Aéreas and is also served by Aerolíneas Argentinas, Copa and Gol Transportes Aéreos. There are domestic flights within Argentina from Rosario to Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Mar del Plata (via Buenos Aires), Mendoza (vía Córdoba), Santa Fe and Villa Gesell (via Buenos Aires) cities as well as international services to, Porto Alegre, Brazil, and Punta del Este, Uruguay (direct flight in summer and via Buenos Aires in fall, winter and spring).\nThe airport is at an altitude of 25 metres (82 ft). Its longest runway measures 3,000 metres (9,843 ft).\n\n\n\n### Port[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Port of Rosario\n\n![](image)The Port of Rosario, c. 1910\nThe Port of Rosario is an inland port and a major goods-shipping centre of Argentina, located in the city of Rosario, province of Santa Fe, on the left-hand (western) shore of the Paraná River, about 550 km (340 mi) upstream from the Atlantic Ocean.[56][57]\n\n\nAt this point of the course of the Paraná River (Kilometer 420, Mile 260), there is the depth transition between overseas and river navigation. The main channel of the river directly in front of the port has an advantageous configuration that allows preservation of a depth of 10 metres (34 ft) with minor periodic dredging. This allows for downstream navigation of vessels up to Panamax standards. The Paraná is about 600 metres (1,970 ft) wide at Kilometer 418. It becomes 2,000 m (1.2 mi) wide downstream.\n\n\nThe port is the largest of a series located in the several cities of the Greater Rosario that lie on the Paraná; the last (northernmost) able of overseas traffic being Puerto General San Martín (23 km (14 mi). It is part of the Bi-Oceanic Corridor, which joins the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean via Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba, and the Cuyo region; going north–south it forms the axis of the Paraguay-Paraná waterway. It directly services the area of Santa Fe that produces a large portion of Argentine exports, and indirectly the whole Mercosur trade bloc. In 2003 the traffic in the port amounted to 2.9 million tonnes (3,200,000 short tons).\n\n\nCargo from other parts of Argentina is brought into the port by the railway lines of the Nuevo Central Argentino, communicating with Córdoba (west) and Zárate, Buenos Aires (south), as well as the multiple national and provincial roads and highways that converge in Rosario. Communication with the north-eastern part of the country was enhanced by the 2003 opening of the Rosario-Victoria Bridge, that joins the city with the province of Entre Ríos. The Rosario International Airport (located 15 km (9 mi) west) has also been refurbished to work with cargo traffic.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Teachers' School, on Córdoba Avenue\n![](image)National University of Rosario Law School\nRosario is an important educational centre at a national and international level. It is the home of the National University of Rosario (UNR) since 1968, which includes the Law Faculty, the Medicine Faculty, the Humanities Faculty and an advanced study centre called *Ciudad Universitaria de Rosario* (university city of Rosario) that is home to more than 10 colleges, among them the Faculty of Psychology, the Faculty of Political Sciences, and the Faculty of Architecture. It is also home of the Rosario Regional Faculty, a branch of the National Technological University (UTN). All of these national colleges are free.\n\n\nIn the city there are approximately 624 establishments destined for elementary levels and secondary education, the Technical Institute, which depends directly on the UNR. With a solid tradition as for university education, it is head of several academic institutions, and is public, and free access.\n\n\nCurrently, there are some 80,000 university students at various institutions around the city, representing approximately 8.5% of the total population. This rate is one of the highest in Argentina. In Rosario, nearly 15% of the population benefits from higher education degrees, or have undergone at least some university studies.\n\n\nRosario has private colleges, as the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina (UCA), the Austral University, the University of the Latin American Educational Center (UCEL), the Interamerican Open University (UAI), the Italian University of Rosario (IUNIR), the San Martin University and the University of Concepcion del Uruguay which are private institutions.\n\n\n\n## Language[edit]\n\n\nRosario is the third largest urban center where Rioplatense Spanish is spoken, after Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The local language evidences the typical linguistic features that characterize this dialect, notably the voseo (use of *vos* instead of *tú* as pronoun for the second person singular) and the *sheísmo* (form of yeísmo where *ll-* and *y-* are pronounced as a voiceless [ʃ]). Although the *español rosarino* does not differ substantially from the other variants of the same dialect, it presents particularities easily noticeable by those who live in the other main populated areas of the region.\n\n\nOne of the most notable characteristics of the language of Rosario's area of influence is the process of aspiration and disappearance of the *-s*. When the *-s* is in implosive position, end of syllable or word followed by consonant, its sound becomes a soft and voiceless aspiration [h] (the word *obispo* is pronounced **o̞ˈβihpo̞**). In the popular and vulgar language, the final *-s*, *-r*, or *-d* are sometimes suppressed, although this phenomenon is commonly associated to sociocultural groups of lower formal education.[58]\n\n\nJust as in Buenos Aires, the *voseo* is pronominal and verbal. The pronoun *tú* and its associated verbal forms are inexistent (which is not the case of the Montevideo variant) The tendency to add a final *-s* to the verbal forms of the second person plural (*vos fuistes*, *vos vinistes*), which is rather common in Buenos Aires, is very unusual among Rosario natives.\n\n\nEven though the lexicon of Rosario and Buenos Aires is effectively identical, there are numerous terms and idioms that Rosario shares with the rest of the country (even areas where a different dialect prevails) but not with the capital, as well as other words and expressions that are unique to the *rosarino* speech, both formal and informal.\n\n\nThe *Rosarigasino* is a type of Jerigonza (game of words) that originated in the city and was rather common in the informal speech during the 20th century. Although it has fallen into disuse, it has become a language of cult among certain local groups.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lionel Messi, born in Rosario in 1987\nRosario is the home of the football clubs Rosario Central (founded 1889) and Newell's Old Boys (founded 1903). Both play in Primera División Argentina. Central has won four National championships (in 1971, 1973, 1980 and in 1987), six National cups (1913, 1915, two cups in 1916, 1920 and 2018),[59][60] and one international title: the Conmebol Cup (in 1995, precursor of the current Copa Sudamericana).[61][62][63][64][65][66]\nNewell's has 6 National championships (in 1974, 1988, 1991, 1992, 2004 and in 2013) and 3 National cups (in 1911, 1921 and in 1949). Rosario's other football clubs are Club Atlético Central Córdoba, currently playing in Primera C, Club Atlético Tiro Federal Argentino in Torneo Argentino A and Argentino de Rosario in Primera D.\n\n\nIt is also the hometown of Argentine internationals Lionel Messi, Ángel Di María, Maximiliano Rodríguez, César Delgado, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Mauro Icardi, Giovani Lo Celso, Leandro Fernández, Ezequiel Garay, Luciana Aymar, Juan Imhoff, Ángel Correa, Nicolás Vergallo and Leonardo Senatore.\n\n\nThe city received international attention as the host of the II South American Games in 1982, as one of the host cities of the 1978 FIFA World Cup, the 1982 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship, the 1993 FIVB Volleyball Men's U21 World Championship, the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship and the 1990 Basketball World Cup.[67] Rosario also bid for the 2019 Pan American Games but the Argentine Olympic Committee (COA) voted to support La Punta instead.[68]\n\n\nRosario is the second choice site for Argentine rugby tests, after Buenos Aires. Famous rugby clubs from the city include Club Atlético del Rosario – one of the four UAR founding clubs – and also Jockey Club de Rosario and Duendes Rugby Club, both former winners of the Nacional de Clubes title. The city hosted the 2010 IRB Junior World Championship.\n\n\nThe 2010 Women's Hockey World Cup, 2004 and 2012 Champions Trophy and the 2014–15 Women's FIH Hockey World League Final were played there.\n\n\nIn 2014 the city hosted the Inline speed skating World Championship at Parque de la Independencia[69] and in 2015 it hosted the men's, women's and juniors' FIRS Inline Hockey World Championships at Club Atlético Provincial's indoor arena.[70]\n\n\nRosario hosted the 2017 World Archery Youth Championships, and will host the 2018 FIBA Under-17 Basketball World Cup, and the 2019 South American Beach Games.\n\n\n\n### Motorsports[edit]\n\n\nThe city was the starting point for the 2014 Dakar Rally, as well as the finishing point in 2016. It also hosted the 2015 World RX of Argentina.\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Participants carry the national colors on Flag Day (June 20).\n* *Festival Latinoamericano de Video Rosario* (Rosario Latin American Video Festival). Annual event (September), starting in 1994.\n* *Encuentro Internacional de Escultura en Madera-Piedra-Hierro de Rosario* (International Meeting of Wood-Stone-Iron Sculpture in Rosario). Annual event (September/October), since 1993.\n* *Encuentro y Fiesta Nacional de Colectividades* (Communities Meeting and National Celebration). Annual event, starting in 1985, showcasing music, song, dance, cuisine and customs of foreign communities in Argentina, in the ample room provided by the *Parque Nacional a la Bandera* (National Flag Park). Usually held in November; in 2004 it was postponed to the beginning of December in order to avoid overlap with the Third International Congress of the Spanish Language.\n* *Festival Internacional de Poesía de Rosario* (International Poetry Festival). Annual event since 1993 (November).\n* *Festival Iberoamericano de Cine de Rosario* (Ibero-American Film Festival). Annual event since 2003 (November).\n* *Leyendas* (\"Legends\"). A cartoon, role-playing and science fiction convention. Annually since 1999, usually in autumn (April/May), sometimes in spring (November).\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Rosario\n\n![](image)Rosario metropolitan area in the Province of Santa Fe\nThe city of Rosario measures 178.69 km2 (69.0 sq mi), not all of them are fully urbanized. Its extreme points are:\n\n\n\n* Latitude: parallels 32°52′18″ and 33°02′22″ South.\n* Longitude: meridians 60°36′44″ and 60°47′46″ West.\n\n\nThe geographical center is approximately at 32°57′2″S 60°42′15″W﻿ / ﻿32.95056°S 60.70417°W﻿ / -32.95056; -60.70417\n\n\nThe city is located on a smoothly undulated plain typical of the Pampas, between 22.5 and 24.6 metres above mean sea level; the original settlement rests on the ravine on the right-hand shore of the Paraná, opposite a group of islands of the Paraná Delta which are partly in the jurisdiction of the province of Entre Ríos. The nearest city across the river's flood plain (60 km) is Victoria, Entre Ríos, linked to Rosario by the Rosario-Victoria Bridge.\n\n\nRosario lies on the ravine of the right-hand shore of the Paraná, about 24 metres (79 ft) above mean sea level, in a place with a natural slope to the low shore. The point of origin of the city is *Plaza 25 de Mayo* (\"May 25 Square\"), now surrounded by the municipality (*Palacio de los Leones*), the Basilica Cathedral of Our Lady of the Rosary, the Central Post Office, the Decorative Art Museum and a building called *La Bola de Nieve* (\"The Snowball\"). Between the Cathedral and the municipal building is *Pasaje Juramento* (\"Oath Passage\"), leading to the Flag Memorial. The streets mostly follow a regular checkerboard pattern.\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Climate chart\nThe Rosario area has a *Pampean*, humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa/Cwa),[71] and is well known for its changeable weather conditions. The city has average temperatures of 23.7 °C (74.7 °F) maximum and 11.8 °C (53.2 °F) minimum. The annual rainfall is 1,038 mm (40.9 in).\n\n\nRosario is usually warmer than other mainland Argentine capital cities in the winter. The lowest average in winter is 4.4 °C (40 °F). This is due in part to the city's flat topography, its situation on the Paraná River bank, and the presence of high density of urbanization. Those conditions have created a microclimate known as urban heat island that often means that the city is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas.\n\n\nThe temperature difference usually is larger at night than during the day and larger in winter than in summer, and is most apparent when winds are weak. However, snowfalls are extremely rare: the most recent occurrence of sleet in the CBD was on 9 July 2007.\nDuring the spring, Rosario commonly enjoys extended periods of warm weather and clear skies. On average, Rosario has average day-night temperatures of 23–10 °C (73–50 °F). The city experiences hot and humid summer days, with maximum temperatures above 35 °C (95 °F), when northerly winds blow humid air from Brazil. The record high temperature is 40.5 °C (104.9 °F) on January 9, 2006, while the record low is −8.4 °C (17 °F) on July 15, 2020.[72]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Rosario (Islas Malvinas Airport), elevation: 25 m, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1875–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n | 39.3(102.7)\n | 37.0(98.6)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 37.3(99.1)\n | 38.0(100.4)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 30.9(87.6)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 27.7(81.9)\n | 23.9(75.0)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 17.0(62.6)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 29.8(85.6)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 17.8(64.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | 4.9(40.8)\n | 6.3(43.3)\n | 8.7(47.7)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | −0.9(30.4)\n | −6.1(21.0)\n | −8.1(17.4)\n | −8.4(16.9)\n | −7.8(18.0)\n | −4.8(23.4)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n | 5.1(41.2)\n | −8.4(16.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 120.7(4.75)\n | 127.4(5.02)\n | 138.4(5.45)\n | 119.9(4.72)\n | 57.7(2.27)\n | 28.3(1.11)\n | 23.0(0.91)\n | 35.3(1.39)\n | 48.0(1.89)\n | 118.7(4.67)\n | 108.2(4.26)\n | 127.9(5.04)\n | 1,053.5(41.48)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 7.3\n | 7.7\n | 7.4\n | 8.5\n | 5.3\n | 4.5\n | 4.2\n | 3.6\n | 5.3\n | 8.9\n | 8.2\n | 9.0\n | 79.8\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 67.8\n | 72.8\n | 75.4\n | 78.1\n | 81.0\n | 80.9\n | 77.9\n | 72.6\n | 68.5\n | 69.3\n | 65.6\n | 65.5\n | 73.0\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 297.6\n | 240.1\n | 235.6\n | 183.0\n | 173.6\n | 147.0\n | 173.6\n | 195.3\n | 195.0\n | 223.2\n | 267.0\n | 288.3\n | 2,619.3\n |\n| Mean daily sunshine hours | 9.6\n | 8.5\n | 7.6\n | 6.1\n | 5.6\n | 4.9\n | 5.6\n | 6.3\n | 6.5\n | 7.2\n | 8.9\n | 9.3\n | 7.2\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 73\n | 71\n | 64\n | 64\n | 58\n | 50\n | 52\n | 59\n | 56\n | 58\n | 65\n | 65\n | 61\n |\n| Source 1: Servicio Meteorológico Nacional[73][74][75] |\n| Source 2: Meteo Climat (record highs and lows),[76] Oficina de Riesgo Agropecuario (March/April/October/November/December record highs, and July/September/October/December record low),[77] UNLP (percent sun 1971–1980)[78] |\n\n## Broadcasting and communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rosario offices of Telecom Argentina\n![](image)Headquarters of *La Capital* newspaper\nRosario has two private local television channels, Canal 3 and Canal 5 (the latter is part of the national network Telefé), and a relay station for the public national station, Canal 7 Argentina. There are also three cable TV networks (the national ones Cablevisión and Multicanal, and a local network, Cablehogar), which support two local channels, Canal 4 Noticias and Canal 6.\n\n\nThere are four AM radio stations: three private (licensed by the state) ones, LT3 Radio 2 (LT2), and LT8, and one public, Radio Nacional Rosario, property of the national state. Among the multitude (above 200) of FM stations, some notable ones are FM Vida, Estación del Siglo, FM Del Rosario, Cristal FM, Radio Hollywood, Fisherton-CNN, Continental Rosario, Radio 10 Rosario, Radiofónica, and Clásica Rosario.\n\n\nThe city has three notable newspapers: *La Capital* (Argentina's oldest newspaper, founded in 1867, and still published today), *Rosario/12* (founded in 1991), and *El Ciudadano & La Región* (founded in 1999).\n\n\nRosario is located at the center of Argentina's optical fiber ring. The main data transport companies offer all their services in the city, from public phones to mobile networks and broadband Internet access through DSL, cable modem and Wi-Fi, and including public Internet navigation centers (cybercafes).\n\n\nAbout 96% of homes have a domestic telephone line, giving a total of 472,170 lines; cell phone usage has also become pervasive, as happened in Argentina as a whole since the beginning of the 21st century, reaching over 86% of the residents (866,000 mobile lines in July 2004). This demand, boosted by low prices and sale promotions, and coupled with restrictions on the installation of antennas and alleged lack of investment by the providers, sometimes degrades the quality of the service. Most notably, the mobile network collapsed almost completely in the celebrations of Christmas, New Year's Day and Friend's Day in 2004 and 2005.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nNotable people from Rosario include the following:\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Luciana Aymar, field hockey player\n* Gato Barbieri, jazz composer\n* Antonio Berni, painter\n* Marcelo Bielsa, football coach\n* Emiliano Boffelli, rugby union player\n* Felipe Martinez Carbonell, film director[79]\n* Ángel Correa, football player\n* José Cura, operatic tenor[80][81]\n* Ángel Di María, football player\n* Lucio Fontana, artist\n* Roberto Fontanarrosa, cartoonist\n* Angélica Gorodischer, writer\n* Che Guevara, revolutionary\n* Hugo Gutiérrez, football player\n* Jana Rodriguez Hertz, mathematician\n* Mauro Icardi, football player\n | * Juan Imhoff, rugby union player\n* Libertad Lamarque, actress\n* Giovanni Lo Celso, football player\n* Gerardo Martino, football player and coach\n* Valeria Mazza, model\n* Yamile Saied Mendez, writer\n* César Luis Menotti, football coach\n* Lionel Messi, football player\n* Alberto Olmedo, actor/comedian\n* Fito Páez, singer-songwriter\n* Patricio Pron, writer\n* Maximiliano Rodríguez, football player\n* Leonardo Senatore, rugby union player\n* Dorothy Wrinch, mathematician and biochemical theorist\n* Alberto Demiddi, rower\n* Juan Carlos Baglietto, singer\n\n\n |\n\n* ![Libertad Lamarque](image)\n\nLibertad Lamarque\n* ![Che Guevara](image)\n\nChe Guevara\n* ![Ángel Di María](image)\n\nÁngel Di María\n* ![Lionel Messi](image)\n\nLionel Messi\n* ![Luciana Aymar](image)\n\nLuciana Aymar\n* ![Marcelo Bielsa](image)\n\nMarcelo Bielsa\n* ![Valeria Mazza](image)\n\nValeria Mazza\n* ![Juan Imhoff](image)\n\nJuan Imhoff\n* ![Felipe Martinez Carbonell](image)\n\nFelipe Martinez Carbonell\n\n\n## Twin towns – sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Argentina\n\nRosario is twinned with:[82]\n\n\n\n* ![Italy](image) Alessandria, Italy\n* ![Kazakhstan](image) Almaty, Kazakhstan\n* ![Paraguay](image) Asunción, Paraguay\n* ![Spain](image) Bilbao, Spain\n* ![Venezuela](image) Caracas, Venezuela\n* ![Ecuador](image) Cuenca, Ecuador\n* ![Senegal](image) Dakar, Senegal\n* ![Israel](image) Haifa, Israel\n* ![Italy](image) Imperia, Italy\n* ![Kuwait](image) Kuwait City, Kuwait\n* ![Colombia](image) Manizales, Colombia\n* ![Colombia](image) Medellín, Colombia\n* ![Mexico](image) Monterrey, Mexico\n* ![Uruguay](image) Montevideo, Uruguay\n* ![Greece](image) Piraeus, Greece\n* ![Peru](image) Pisco, Peru\n* ![Brazil](image) Porto Alegre, Brazil\n* ![China](image) Shanghai, China\n* ![Cuba](image) Santa Clara, Cuba\n* ![Bolivia](image) Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia\n* ![Cuba](image) Santiago de Cuba, Cuba\n* ![Dominican Republic](image) Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n* ![United States](image) St. Louis, United States\n* ![Italy](image) Turin, Italy\n* ![Chile](image) Valparaíso, Chile\n\n### Cooperation agreements[edit]\n\n\nRosario also cooperates with:[83]\n\n\n\n* ![Chile](image) Viña del Mar, Chile\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Argentina portal\n\n\n* History of Rosario\n* Port of Rosario\n* Geography of Rosario\n* Government of Rosario\n* Districts of Rosario\n* Olinto Gallo Workshops\n* Palacio Cabanellas\n* Parana River steamers\n* Rondeau Boulevard\n* 2013 Rosario gas explosion\n* Fernando Traverso's Bicis\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Sitio de la Municipalidad de Rosario\". *Sitio de la Municipalidad de Rosario*.\n2. **^** Página del Ministerio de Educación de la Nación sobre el Monumento Histórico Nacional a la Bandera.

The city is located 300 km (186 mi) northwest of Buenos Aires, on the west bank of the Paraná River. Rosario is the third-most populous city in the country, and is also the most populous city in Argentina that is not a capital (provincial or national). With a growing and important metropolitan area, Greater Rosario has an estimated population of 1,750,000 as of 2020[update].[4][5] One of its main attractions includes the neoclassical, Art Nouveau,[6] and Art Deco architecture that has been retained over the centuries in hundreds of residences, houses and public buildings.\n\n\nRosario is the head city of the Rosario Department and is located at the heart of the major industrial corridor in Argentina. The city is a major railroad terminal and the shipping center for north-eastern Argentina. Ships reach the city via the Paraná River, which allows the existence of a 10-metre-deep (34 ft) port. The Port of Rosario is subject to silting and must be dredged periodically.[7] Exports include wheat, flour, hay, linseed and other vegetable oils, corn, sugar, lumber, meat, hides, and wool. Manufactured goods include flour, sugar, meat products, and other foodstuffs. The Rosario-Victoria Bridge, opened in 2004, spans the Paraná River, connecting Rosario with the city of Victoria, across the Paraná Delta. The city plays a critical role in agricultural commerce, and thus finds itself at the center of a continuing debate over taxes levied on big-ticket agricultural goods such as soy.\n\n\nAlong with Paraná, Rosario is one of the few Argentine cities that cannot point to a particular individual as its founder. The city's patron is the \"Virgin of the Rosary\", whose feast day is October 7.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Rosario\n\n### Early settlement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the city of Rosario c. 1877\n![](image)Rosario port area in 1888\nEven though the city did not have a clear foundation date or any official acknowledgement thereof, most commentators state that Rosario was founded on 7 October 1793 with a local population of 457 inhabitants.[8] Nonetheless, the town was officially declared a *city* on 3 August 1852, at the time it was known as ***Pago de los Arroyos***, that is, \"land of the streams\", a reference to the several small rivers that traverse the southern region of Santa Fe, like the Ludueña Stream, the Saladillo Stream and others, emptying into the Paraná River. In 1689, captain Luís Romero de Piñeda received part of the lands of the Pago de los Arroyos by royal decree, as payment for services to the Spanish Crown. Before that, the area was originally inhabited by various indigenous tribes, some of which lived in *reducciones*, a type of mission founded by Franciscans. These missions were ultimately attacked and destroyed by hostile tribes of the Chaco region.\n\n\nRomero de Piñeda established the first permanent settlement, an *estancia* — intended as farmland, not as a town. In 1719, the Jesuits bought another part and established *Estancia San Miguel*. The area was still so scarcely populated that it had no central authority; it was ruled from the provincial capital (Santa Fe), and in turn from Buenos Aires.\n\n\nIn 1724, another colonial settlement was initiated by Santiago de Montenegro, who set up a mill, drew plans for the future town, built a chapel, and was appointed mayor in 1751. The area of control of this local government extended northward from today's Rosario; only in 1784 was it divided into two smaller jurisdictions.\n\n\nOn February 27, 1812, General Manuel Belgrano raised the newly created Argentine flag on the shores of the Paraná, for the first time. Because of this, Rosario is known as the \"Cradle of the Argentine Flag\". The National Flag Memorial marks the occasion.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rosario's old Customs Office, on Belgrano Avenue\nThe province of Santa Fe suffered greatly from the civil war that afflicted Argentina after 1820. Demographic growth was relatively slow. During this period, Rosario was a small settlement and a stop on the way from the city of Santa Fe to Buenos Aires. In 1823, it was elevated to the category of \"village\" (*Ilustre y Fiel Villa del Rosario*). Charles Darwin travelled through the area in 1832 and described Rosario as \"a large town\" with about 2,000 residents. In 1841, a decree of the *caudillo* and Governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, banned navigation of the Paraná and Paraguay rivers to non-Argentine vessels, and thus shut off the Port of Rosario to foreign trade.\n\n\nOn 25 December 1851, a small group of locals and the military guard of the city declared their support for the rival *caudillo* Justo José de Urquiza. As a reward for their participation in the Battle of Caseros, triumphant Urquiza wrote to the governor of Santa Fe on 9 June 1852 asking for Rosario to be granted city status. Governor Domingo Crespo justified the request at the provincial legislative body, marking the geographically strategic position of the town for national and international trade, and on 5 August, Rosario was formally declared a city.\n\n\nUrquiza opened up the river for free international trade. The city's economy and population expanded at an accelerated rate. By 1880, Rosario had become the first export outlet of Argentina. During the last 15 years of the 19th century, the city more than doubled its population, in part due to immigration. By 1887 it had about 50,000 inhabitants, of whom 40% were European immigrants, who brought new ideas from Europe and began to turn Rosario into a politically progressive city (contrasting with the more conservative, aristocratic Santa Fe).\n\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, there was a movement promoting that the city of Rosario become the capital of the republic. Ovidio Lagos, founder of the oldest Argentine newspaper, *La Capital*, was one of the strongest proponents of this idea (one of the main avenues in Rosario now carries his name). Rosario was indeed declared the federal capital on three occasions, but each time the law was vetoed by the Executive Branch (once by Bartolomé Mitre and twice by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento). In 1911, the French-owned railway company Ferrocarril Rosario y Puerto Belgrano opened a line between Rosario and Puerto Belgrano, Argentina's main naval base. By 1926, Rosario had 407,000 inhabitants, 47% of them foreign, many coming from Europe in the wake of World War I.\n\n\n\n### Contemporary history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)National Flag Memorial, downtown Rosario\nIn 1969, workers and students took to the streets and organized strikes in what has been dubbed the \"Rosariazo\" against the dictatorship. A few years later, in 1976, the military dictatorship made hundreds of dissident citizens \"disappear\" in what is known as the Dirty War.\n\n\nIn 1983, Argentina returned to democratic rule, but in 1989, hyperinflation caused the economic collapse of the country. In Rosario there were riots and looting episodes. Under the Menem administration, the situation worsened as the industrial sector of the city was dismantled by foreign competition, and agricultural exports stagnated. In 1995, unemployment in the area reached 21.1% and a large part of Rosario's population fell below the poverty line.\n\n\nSince the recovery of the national economy that followed the 2001 collapse, Rosario's economic situation has improved. The boom in agricultural exports has caused a large increase in consumer spending and investment. The Socialist Party has won mayoral races in the city in every election since Councilman Héctor Cavallero's 1989 election. Cavallero's successor, Hermes Binner (elected in 1995), was elected Governor of Santa Fe in 2007 and became the runner-up in the 2011 presidential election on the FAP ticket. Mayor Miguel Lifschitz's administration, elected in 2007, took advantage of the economic boom to invest heavily in public works as well as in public health (which takes up about a quarter of the whole budget). Mayor Mónica Fein became, in 2011, the first Socialist woman elected mayor in Argentine history.[9]\n\n\nAfter the 1990s, Rosario became a major city of the illegal drug trade in Argentina, headed by a drug dealing family called \"Los Monos\" (\"The Monkeys\").[10] Early during 2018, it was estimated by national news sources that a turf war between local drug gangs (\"Los Funes\" and \"Los Camino\") was costing an average of one life every twenty five hours.[11][12]\n\n\n\n### Historical images\n[edit]\n\n\n* ![Mercado Sud (c.1903)](image)\n\nMercado Sud (c.1903)\n* ![Palace of Justice (c.1905)](image)\n\nPalace of Justice (c.1905)\n* ![Hotel Savoy (c.1910)](image)\n\nHotel Savoy (c.1910)\n* ![San Martín Square (c.1920s)](image)\n\nSan Martín Square (c.1920s)\n* ![Hipólito Yrigoyen on a train during an electoral campaign (1926)](image)\n\nHipólito Yrigoyen on a train during an electoral campaign (1926)\n* ![Inauguration of the National Flag Memorial (1957)](image)\n\nInauguration of the National Flag Memorial (1957)\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Government of Rosario\n\n![](image)*Palacio de los Leones* (City Hall)\nRosario is ruled by an executive branch represented by a mayor (seat: Palacio de los Leones), and a legislative branch, consisting of a Deliberative Council (seat: Palacio Vassallo). The mayor is elected for a four-year term, and the Council renews half of its 21 members every two years.\n\n\n\n### Municipal Centre District (CMD)[edit]\n\n\nSince 1997, a municipal program of decentralization of legislative activities was carried out, materialized in 6 Municipal Centres of District (Centre, North, South, West, Northwest and Southwest).\n\n\nThe city is divided into six large administrative districts (Center, North, Northwest, West, Southwest, and South), with Municipal District Centers that provide services to the population.\n\n\nFor years, local people and institutions have been pushing the provincial government to grant Rosario the status of Autonomous City. Some, with the sponsorship of the governors of Santa Fe, Entre Ríos and Córdoba as well as other important politicians, have put forward a legislative project to move the National Congress to Rosario, to decentralize the national government.[13]\n\n\nSince the return to democracy in 1983, the mayors of Rosario were Horacio Usandizaga, Héctor Cavallero (standing in for Usandizaga, then re-elected), Hermes Binner (re-elected once), Miguel Lifschitz (re-elected once), and, since December 2011 to December 2019, Mónica Fein. Currently, the mayor is Pablo Javkin, whose term lasts from December 2019 to 2023. From Cavallero on (1989), the mayor has been a member of the Socialist Party, since December 2019, Rosario's mayor is from a different political party, ending more than 30 years of socialism.\n\n\nThe city does not have a police force of its own (it is served by the provincial police), but in 2004 it pioneered the creation of a special patrol force of unarmed officers called *Guardia Urbana Municipal* (\"Municipal Urban Guard\"), which was later used as a model for Buenos Aires and other cities.\n\n\n\n![](image)*Parroquia del Perpetuo Socorro*, a church at Lisandro de la Torre district\n### Municipal statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe municipality of Rosario comprises 178.69 square kilometres (69.0 sq mi), of which 117.2 km2 (45 sq mi) are urbanized, in 6,306 housing blocks. Of this area, 9.3 km2 (3.6 sq mi), 5.3% is devoted to green spaces (parks, boulevards, plazas), which gives over 10 m2 of green space per inhabitant.\n\n\nElectric power is supplied to the whole urban area and running water reaches 97% of the population (about 350,000 homes). Natural gas is provided to 227,152 homes.[14]\n\n\nWith the recovery of the national economy since 2002, the city experienced a real-estate boom. In the period 2003–2006, the construction sector added 2 million m2, investing about $900 million. Despite this increased supply, both price and rent have increased sharply compared to the values during the 1990s.\n\n\nAccording to experts, this growth was propelled by the increased purchasing power of farmers around Rosario, helped by competitive exports, and the overall preference for safer investment options.[15]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nRosario has several public health centers: five municipal hospitals (including a children's hospital and an emergency hospital/trauma center) and a municipal outpatient-only center, plus two large provincial hospitals (Hospital Provincial and Hospital Centenario), and their associated primary care centers in the city proper and its metropolitan area.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Argentina\n\n![](image)Bolsa de Comercio Rosario: The Rosario Stock Exchange\nRosario is the centre of a metropolitan region whose economy is based on services and industry, generating the second-largest urban gross regional product of Argentina, after Greater Buenos Aires.[*citation needed*][16] The principal manufacturing sector is the agro industry, whose industries are placed in the northern and southern areas of Greater Rosario; the investments over the last decade have transformed Rosario into a major role of processing oil of the world[17] Many other sectors contribute to the diversified industrial offerings of the city. Rosario and its metropolitan area produce 20% of the cars, 4% of the domestic refrigerators, 80% of the machinery for the food industry and 100% of the auto bodies for long-distance buses made in Argentina.\n\n\nOther important sectors include the petrochemical sector, with three plants located in the suburbs of San Lorenzo and Port San Martin; the chemistry sector, with plants for sulphuric acid, fertilizers, resins and other products; the cellulose industry; the meat industry; ironworks; auto parts; the plants and equipment for bottled oil; agricultural machinery; and the materials and equipment for the construction industry.\nWorldwide international companies settled in Rosario include, among others, General Motors, Cargill, Unilever, John Deere, Petrobrás, ICI, Dow, Tenneco and Mahle.\n\n\nThe main financial bank at the city of Rosario is the Municipal Bank of Rosario. Its central offices are located in the financial district, on San Martín St., and there are several additional offices throughout the city. It is focused on small and medium enterprises and other organizations, especially through micro credits, and may be considered an \"ethical bank.\"[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wood chips carrier Racer on the Paraná River, just coming under the Rosario-Victoria Bridge\nThe Municipal Bank was founded in 1896 to support the financial needs of the citizens and small businesses in the highly productive region of southern Santa Fe Province, centered in Rosario. At the time, the city had around 92,000 inhabitants and was already the most important port on the Paraná River. The idea of creating a municipal financial institution was expressed in 1893 by Mayor Floduardo Grandoli, citing the proliferation of \"centers of usury\" that exploited those in need of credit, especially the poor (something not addressed by the profile of the Provincial Bank of Santa Fe, which granted loans only to demonstrably solvent persons). Acting on this, the municipal Counseling Commission passed a bill (on 1 February 1895) dictating an \"Organic Charter of the Municipal Bank of Loans and Savings Accounts;\" the bank opened exactly one year later.\n\n\nThe seat of the bank was moved in 1905. Its name was changed to its present form on 14 May 1940 by a municipal bill. Its location was moved again, for the last time so far, in 1986. Following some political controversy, the bank in 2006 was capitalized by the municipality to comply with new regulations dictated by the Central Bank, and transformed into a joint stock company, with only 1% of the stock belonging to the municipal state. A special clause was added, dictating that this minimum share is unchangeable, to prevent hypothetical attempts at privatization.[19]\n\n\nThe Rosario Board of Trade hosts the country's largest commodity market, dealing in cereals and oilseeds, and also the largest futures exchange (ROFEX). The banking sector includes the state-owned Municipal Bank of Rosario, with branches and offices throughout the city, and the central branch of the New Bank of Santa Fe.\n\n\nThe largest technological center in Argentina – Polo Tecnológico Rosario (PTR) – is located in Rosario within La Siberia site. The center focuses mainly on research and development of the three following areas: biotechnology, software development, and telecommunications. It currently employs 3,500 people, and it is expected to grow 100% by 2015 to become one of the largest in Latin America.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nRosario has many cultural activities in many artistic disciplines with national and international reach. The city has produced important personalities in the fields of music, painting, philosophy, politics, poetry, literature, medicine, and law. Among the city's important theaters are El Círculo, Sala Lavardén, Broadway, Astengo Auditorium, and La Comedia. A cultural complex known as Puerto de la Música,[20] designed by the modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer (of Brasilia fame), is to be built along the banks of the Paraná River. If completed, it will be one of the largest centers for musical performance in Latin America. In 2012, after years without progress, it was put on indefinite hold due to financial constraints. January 1995 saw the launch of the Rosario District Fishing Championship, held in the Parana River. Three years later, in 1998, a 10-year-old Lionel Messi was crowned Junior Champion.\n\n\nThe city has several museums, including Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum, Firma y Odilo Estévez Municipal Decorative Art Museum, Dr. Julio Marc Provincial Historical Museum, City Museum, and Museum of Contemporary Art of Rosario (MACRo). The Dr. Ángel Gallardo Provincial Natural Sciences Museum was rebuilt after a fire in 2003 and re-opened at a new location in 2006. Rosario also has a public astronomy complex, located in Urquiza Park, which consists of an observatory (inaugurated in 1970) and a planetarium (1984).\n\n\nThe Fundación Italia is a cultural institution created in 1985 as a \"cultural bond with Italy\". It has organized a Neapolitan music concert, performances of *Madame Butterfly* and numerous talks about the present and future of Argentina. Among the people invited to give these talks were economists Domingo Cavallo and Alfonso Prat Gay, renowned scholars Beatriz Sarlo and Silvia Bleichmar, journalists Alejandro Rozitchner and Jorge Asís, filmmaker Fernando Solanas and former presidents of Chile (Ricardo Lagos), Argentina (Eduardo Duhalde), and Uruguay (Luis Alberto Lacalle Herrera).\n\n\n\n![](image)*El Círculo* Theatre\n![](image)Planetarium of Rosario\n![](image)Museum of Contemporary Art of Rosario\n![](image)Municipal Museum of Rosario\n### Cultural centers[edit]\n\n\n* Centro Cultural Roberto Fontanarrosa\n* Centro Popular de la Memoria\n* Centro Cultural Islas Malvinas\n* Centro Cultural Estación Provincial\n* Grupo Pasajes\n* Centro de Cultura & Comunicación\n* Centro Cultural El Núcleo\n* Centro Cultural Los Hornos\n\n\n### Theaters[edit]\n\n\n* Teatro El Círculo\n* Teatro La Comedia\n* Teatro Auditorio Fundación\n* Teatro Sala Lavardén\n* Teatro Puerto de la Música\n* Teatro Municipal Coliseo Podestá\n* Anfiteatro Martín Fierro\n* Teatro La Nonna\n* Teatro La Hermandad del Princesa\n* Sala 420\n* Taller de Teatro de la UNLP\n* Complejo \"El Teatro\"\n* Teatro \"La Lechuza\"\n* Teatro vorterix\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\n* Dr. Julio Marc Provincial Historical Museum\n* Dr. Ángel Gallardo Provincial Natural Sciences Museum\n* Firma y Odilo Estévez Municipal Decorative Art Museum\n* Juan B.

In 1919, construction began of the Popular Opinion. La Tribuna rose Partners in 1928. Moreover, it had started the construction of a new box office. In 1941, the Tribune Paddock (formerly Partners Tribune) was demolished. The final podium of professional construidaes, begun in 1972. Independence Hippodrome was the initiator in Argentina night time racing, with lighting facilities for this purpose. There's also the Jockey Club de Rosario.\n\n\n\nTracks\nThe racecourse features three tracks that are used for entertainment, vacation, and skills.\nThe Main Track has 1,794 metres (5,886 ft) of sand. This track is open on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for tests, with Sunday competitions.\n\n\nThe Assistant Track 1 has 1,650 m (5,413 ft) with sand, used on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays inclusive for the tournaments and some special courses such as race trot.\n\n\nThe Assistant Track 2 has 1,450 m (4,757 ft) of land used to jog and tame.\n\n\n\nTribunes\n* Ex-Tribune Partners: with a privileged view of the oval track and focused, this building covers 1,300 m2 (13,990 sq ft) and three levels, the second is a restaurant seating 150 people.\n* Professional-Tribune, has a covered area of 300 m2 (3,229 sq ft).

It was commissioned in 1944 and inaugurated on June 20, 1957 – the anniversary of the death of Manuel Belgrano, creator of the Argentine flag, who raised it for the first time on an island in the river on February 27, 1812.\n\n\nThe complex has a total area of about 10,000 m2 (107,600 sq ft) and was constructed using stone primarily sourced in the Andes. The structure was designed by the architects Ángel Guido and Alejandro Bustillo, and the monument was adorned with works by sculptors Lola Mora, Eduardo Barnes, Alfredo Bigatti, and José Fioravanti.[23][24]\n\n\nThe Memorial (Monumento) has three parts: the Tower (Torre) or mast, 70 metres (230 ft) high, which commemorates the Revolution of May 1810 and houses Manuel Belgrano's crypt in its base; the Civic Courtyard (Patio Cívico), which symbolizes the effort of the organization of the state (the Courtyard is used for massive open-air shows), and the Triumphal Propylaeum (Propileo Triunfal), representing the nation as organized after the 1853 Constitution. Under the Propylaeum there is the Honor Room for the Flags of America (where the flags of all American nations are displayed).\n\n\nThe complex faces Belgrano Avenue, and is delimited by Córdoba and Santa Fe Streets, the latter of which slopes down towards the river at this point. The Propylaeum can be accessed from the pedestrian passage called Pasaje Juramento (\"Oath Passage\"), which starts at Buenos Aires St. between the municipal building (Palacio de los Leones) and the Cathedral, in front of Plaza 25 de Mayo (May 25 Square). Statues flank the passage by famous sculptor Lola Mora.\n\n\nThe Memorial and the National Flag Park located in front of it are the seat of the main celebrations of Flag Day on June 20. The 50th anniversary of the inauguration of the complex, in 2007, was marked by a special celebration and by the unveiling of a new lighting system.\n[25] El Puerto de la Música will be a theater with a total capacity of 30,000 people located by the Paraná River.\n\n\nArchitect Oscar Niemeyer came up with the concept by expanding the show from inside the theater to a much larger outside audience. The concrete curvilinear shape building with an area of 215,278 sq ft (20,000.0 m2) is the first design of Oscar Niemeyer in Argentina.[26] The project will be a distinctive part of Rosario's skyline. Construction will begin at the end of 2010 and is expected to be completed by 2014.\n\n\n\n#### Planetarium[edit]\n\n\nLocated in Urquiza Park, Rosario's Municipal Astronomical Complex is one of the principal astronomical centers of the region.\n\n\nThe planetarium has a core team, together with its secondary elements, providing an artificial image of the sky through projections made on a fixed hemispherical dome that functions as a display.\n\n\nThe assembly is installed in the Room \"Oscar Claudio Caprile\", located in the heart of the magnificent building that is shaped like a comet.\n\n\nFor its technical characteristics in terms of size, quality of sound and image, and interior comfort, this room is considered among the best in the world.\n\n\nThe building in the shape of a comet forms a part of the complex that includes the \"Prof. Victor Capolongo\" observatory and the experimental science museum.\n\n\n\n##### The observatory[edit]\n\n\nMunicipal Astronomical Observatory \"Prof. Victor Capolongo\" was inaugurated on June 18, 1970, and named its first director.\n\n\nThe Observatory facilitates outreach, teaching, and research in the field of astronomy and related sciences and informs the public of phenomena that occur in the sky, such as eclipses, planetary configurations, passages of comets, etc.\n\n\nTo that end, the Observatory has installed two telescopes. One Coudé refractor has a 150 mm (5.9 in) aperture and 2,250 mm (88.6 in) focal distance provided with Lyot's monochromatic filter for solar observation. Another Cassegrain reflector has 300 mm (11.8 in) aperture, constructed by the Carl Zeiss company.\n\n\nThere are realized observations and astronomical photography of all the visible celestial objects in Rosario's sky, according to time of year and especially the Sun, the Moon, and the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, and Venus.\n\n\nThe asteroid 14812 Rosario was named in the city's honor as a result.[27]\n\n\n\n##### Experimental Science Museum[edit]\n\n\nThis museum was inaugurated on September 24, 1987. It is the first in Argentina and differs from traditional museums, in that it has equipment and instruments to demonstrate the laws of nature, which can be interactively used by the general public.\n\n\nThus, visitors of all ages can use telescopes and microscopes or experiment with lasers, sound mixers, radios of various types, computers, solar cells, etc.\n\n\nTo complement this, exhibit panels have photographs and explanatory texts of science and technology: mathematics and computer science, engineering, physics, astronomy, astronautics, geology, chemistry, and biology. In addition, an important area is intended for periodic samples, such as the Space Age, energy: renewable and rational use, from sand to glass, among others. The museum staff is supported by contributions from the Ministry of Science and Technology Office, the Municipality of Rosario, and the contributions made by institutions and individuals.\n\n\nThe museum audiovisual projections are made in the Video Sector Science, which has an area called \"CIENCIANIÑO\" (ChildScience) for children aged 4 to 10. The museum works in the evening, similar to the Planetarium. Educational institutions at all levels are treated in shift assignments.\n\n\n\n#### Statue of Che Guevara[edit]\n\n\nThe 4-metre-tall bronze statue of Che Guevara was unveiled on 14 June 2008[28] to commemorate the 80th anniversary of his birth. It is made from 75,000 bronze keys donated by Argentines nationwide[28] and weighs 2.7 tons. The statue was made by artist Andrés Zerneri and is the first such monument to Guevara in his native Argentina.[29]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Argentina\n\n### Demographic distribution[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1858 | 9,785 | —     |\n| 1869 | 23,169 | +136.8% |\n| 1887 | 50,914 | +119.8% |\n| 1900 | 112,462 | +120.9% |\n| 1910 | 192,278 | +71.0% |\n| 1926 | 407,354 | +111.9% |\n| 1947 | 584,587 | +43.5% |\n| 1960 | 669,173 | +14.5% |\n| 1970 | 806,942 | +20.6% |\n| 1980 | 956,761 | +18.6% |\n| 1991 | 1,118,905 | +16.9% |\n| 2001 | 1,161,188 | +3.8% |\n| 2010 | 1,193,605 | +2.8% |\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of the Municipal Districts of Rosario, Centre District, North District, Northwest District, West District, Southwest District and South District\nRosario is located in the Province of Santa Fe, Argentina. This metropolis has a population of about 1.2 million (1,159,004 est.), thus being Argentina's third most populated urban settlement, after Córdoba.[30] Greater Rosario comprises Rosario itself (population about 910,000) and a large area around it, spreading in all directions except eastward (because of the Paraná River). Directly to the south, it includes the city of Villa Gobernador Gálvez, with a population of about 75,000, about 10 km (6.2 mi) from Rosario city center.\n\n\nTo the west and south-west there are several smaller towns and cities (Funes, Roldán, Pérez, Soldini); Roldán is 23 km (14 mi) from the Rosario city centre. These settlements were incorporated into the metropolis due to their vicinity to major roads leading into Rosario, and many people living there habitually commute to Rosario.\n\n\nThe farthest end is to the north, following the coast of the river; from Rosario, one finds, in succession and usually merging into each other, the towns of Granadero Baigorria, Capitán Bermúdez, Fray Luis Beltrán, San Lorenzo (already in a different *departamento*, with a population of over 40,000), and Puerto General San Martín, the last being at a distance of 35 km (22 mi) from Rosario.\n\n\nThe north of the Greater Rosario is one end of an area traditionally called *Cordón Industrial* (\"Industrial Corridor\"), since it was traditionally a heavily industrialized productive region. The prelude to the economic crisis in the 1990s largely dismantled the industrial infrastructure and damaged agricultural exports. These sectors were largely revitalized by 2006 as the national economy continued to recover, but high levels of poverty and unemployment persist in the city's western neighborhoods (official surveys indicated that in 2011, 6.5% of the metro area population was under the poverty line; and that in 2012, 8.3% of the labor force was unemployed).[5][31]\n\n\nIn 1876 the total population was 203,509; by 1926, Rosario had 407,000 inhabitants, 47% of them foreign, many having arrived from Europe in the wake of World War I. Most of these were Italian, and among them, a majority from the north-western region of Liguria.\n\n\nAs of the 2010 Census, there were 1,193,605 people residing in the city and 31 surrounding districts, making Greater Rosario the third-largest metro area in Argentina even as its population growth has leveled off.[3] The population density in Rosario proper was 6,680 inhabitants per square kilometer (17,300 inhabitants/sq mi); but, only about 2,400/km2 (6,200/sq mi) in the suburbs.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Club Español de Rosario*, club of the Spanish community in Rosario\nThe 2010 Census also showed a relatively aged population. With 21% under the age of fifteen and 17% over sixty, the people have an age structure similar to those in many North American cities. They are, likewise, more elderly on average than Argentines as a whole (of whom 25% were under 15 and 14%, over 60).[3]\n\n\nThe ethnic make-up of Rosario changed in the late 19th century, when significant numbers of European immigrants arrived in the city. Prior to this the city's population had been almost completely European-descent in ethnic origin. As Buenos Aires was the first landfall in Argentina for many migrant ships coming from Europe in the 1850s and 1890s, Rosario started to experience a diverse influx of people.[*citation needed*] The main contributors were Spain, Italy, France, Croatia, Poland, Russia, Romania, Ukraine, the Balkans (especially Greece, Serbia and Montenegro), Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Scandinavia (especially Sweden). By the 1910s, 43 percent of the city population was non-native Argentine after immigration rates peaked.[33][34]\n\n\nMost immigrants, regardless of origin, settled in the city or around Greater Rosario. However, in the first stages of immigration, some formed colonies (especially agricultural colonies) in different parts of the city, often encouraged by the Argentine government and/or sponsored by private individuals and organizations.\n\n\nChristianity is the dominant faith with Roman Catholicism as the most practiced, followed by Protestantism. Judaism is the second-most professed religion in the city as Rosario has one of the largest Jewish communities in Argentina. There is also a local Islamic society.[35]\n\n\n\n### Districts[edit]\n\n\nRosario is divided into six districts, most named by location, although the easternmost is called *Centre District* for it includes the oldest part of the city, historically called *Centro* (City Centre). The data given below are from the 2001 census [INDEC].\n\n\n\n![](image)Villa Hortensia, the seat of the North District\n![](image)Seat of the Center District, at the former Rosario Central railway station\nCentre District\nPopulation: 261,047   Area: 20.37 km2 (11.45% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 12,815 inhab/km2   Housing: 110,152 units\n\n\n\nNorth District\nPopulation: 131,495   Area: 35.02 km2 (19.6% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 3,744 inhab/km2   Housing: 40,492 units\n\n\n\nNorthwest District\nPopulation: 144,461   Area: 44.14 km2 (24.7% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 3,273 inhab/km2   Housing: 41,740 units\n\n\n\nWest District\nPopulation: 106,356   Area: 40.21 km2 (22.5% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 2,645 inhab/km2   Housing: 31,625 units\n\n\n\nSouthwest District\nPopulation: 103,446   Area: 20.19 km2 (11.3% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 5,123 inhab/km2   Housing: 28,284 units\n\n\n\nSouth District\nPopulation: 160,771   Area: 18.76 km2 (10.5% of the city)  \n\nPopulation density: 8,569 inhab/km2   Housing: 48,541 units\n\n\n\n## Urban structure[edit]\n\n\n### Centre District[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nDowntown Rosario has many bars and cafés.\n![](image)\nThe central offices of the Municipal Bank of Rosario, as pictured in 2006\n\nAt Rosario city center, Córdoba Street is the main avenue. It begins at the Flag Memorial Park, climbs towards the district area, and becomes a pedestrian walk for seven blocks, between Plaza 25 de Mayo and Plaza Pringles. Along Córdoba Ave to the west *Paseo del Siglo* (\"Walk of the Century\") was settled, with former houses of wealthy families, finally there is also the *San Martín Square*, and elsewhere, *Plaza Montenegro* (on *Peatonal San Martín*, the pedestrian-only four blocks of San Martín Street) and *Plaza Sarmiento*.\n\n\nOroño Boulevard (going north–south) and Pellegrini Avenue (east-west) mark the boundaries of the town center together with the river. At their confluence starts the Parque de la Independencia, that houses the Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum, the Newell's Old Boys football club, and the sports clubs *Provincial* and *Gimnasia y Esgrima*, as well as the horse racetrack and the former *Sociedad Rural* (Rural Society).\n\n\nTowards the south, beyond Pellegrini Avenue, there are two more boulevards, 27 de Febrero and Seguí, and avenues Uriburu, Arijón and Battle y Ordóñez.\nTo the west, after Oroño, there are the avenues Ovidio Lagos and Francia, Avellaneda Boulevard and Provincias Unidas Avenue. The main *barrios* in the south are La Tablada, Parque Casado, Las Heras, Las Delicias and Las Flores. The city ends in the Saladillo Stream.\n\n\nAmong the districts in the west are Echesortu, Belgrano, Triángulo, Moderno, Godoy and Fisherton. To the north-east there lie Pichincha, Ludueña, Lisandro de la Torre (home of Rosario Central's stadium) and Empalme Graneros.\n\n\n\n![](image)Night view of the luxury Dolfines Guaraní Towers, May 2010\nNext to the stadium, there is the Parque Alem, and nearby the Sorrento thermal power plant. To the north lie the districts of Alberdi, La Florida (with a popular beach resort of the same name), Parque Field (built under US President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress development plans) and Rucci. The main streets are Alberdi Avenue and its continuation, Rondeau Boulevard (which leads to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge and the city of Granadero Baigorria). These are crossed by the avenues Las Tres Vías, Génova, Sorrento, and Puccio.\n\n\nAn important part of Rosario's urban character is its riverbank. The city recovered the riverbank of the Paraná not long ago, thanks to a reorganization of terrains formerly owned by the port and the national railroad system. Going from the center immediately north of the port, the riverbank is surrounded by a large number of parks; Argentine flag Memorial, Parque de España, Parque de las Colectividades and Parque Sunchales.\n\n\n\n### Greater Rosario[edit]\n\n\nThrough the years, Rosario has spread in all directions. Towards the south, beyond Pellegrini, there are two more boulevards, 27 de Febrero and Seguí, and avenues Uriburu, Arijón and Battle y Ordóñez.To the west, after Oroño, there are the avenues Ovidio Lagos and Francia, Avellaneda Boulevard and Provincias Unidas Avenue. The main neighborhoods in the south are La Tablada, Parque Casado, Las Heras, Las Delicias and Las Flores. The city ends in the Saladillo Stream (the natural border with Villa Gobernador Gálvez). This is just south of the great barrio Grandoli.\n\n\nAmong the neighborhoods in the west are Echesortu, Belgrano, Triángulo, Moderno, Godoy, and Fisherton (near the west end of the city, formerly the home of hierarchical personnel of English railroad companies established in Rosario).\nTo the north-east there lie the neighborhoods of Pichincha (a red-light district in the early 20th century, now home to an open-air antiquities fair: *Mercado de antigüedades \"Feria Retro La Huella\"*), Ludueña, Lisandro de la Torre (home of the Rosario Central football club) and Empalme Graneros; these last three are in the influence area of the Ludueña Stream, now contained by underground piping, but until the 1980s a source of floods.\n\n\nNext to the Rosario Central stadium, there is a large park, Parque Alem, and not far from it, there stands the Sorrento thermoelectric power plant. North of the Lisandro de la Torre neighborhood, there are Alberdi (formerly an independent town), La Florida (with a popular beach resort of the same name), and Rucci.\n\n\nThe main streets in the north are Alberdi Avenue and its continuation, Rondeau Boulevard (which leads to the north exit of the city, the access to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge, and the town of Granadero Baigorria). These major arteries are crossed by several avenues: Las Tres Vías, Génova, Sorrento, and Puccio.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nRosario's strategic location is destined to become a significant transportation hub and as the bi-oceanic corridor that links the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), an important component in global distribution and the core center of a key corridor in the Mercosur, the Common Market for the South.[36]\n\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Rosario, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 50 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 19% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.3 km, while 4% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.[37]\n\n\n\n### Road transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Front entrance and clock tower of the Mariano Moreno Bus Terminal in Rosario\n![](image)Trolleybus in the city centre\n![](image)The city had a tramway network until 1963.\nThe Rosario public transport system includes buses, trolleybuses and taxicabs.\n\n\nThe Rosario trolleybus system consists of only one main trunk line. It is presently operated by a government-owned corporation, SEMTUR (Sociedad del Estado Municipal para el Transporte Urbano de Rosario, \"Municipal State Society for Rosario Urban Transport\"), as are some of Rosario's other urban bus lines.\n\n\nPlaza Sarmiento is the hub of the city bus system, about 40 urban lines in the metropolitan area that provide service every 5 to 10 minutes.\n\n\nBus fares are pre-paid by means of either a rechargeable plastic card or a disposable paper card with a magnetic stripe which can be bought from post offices, automatic vending machines, and private businesses. For occasional use, a larger fare can be paid using a coin machine in the bus unit. The interurban lines have differential fares, and some allow payment in cash only. The municipal administration is phasing out the paper cards, in favor of the plastic ones, during the second half of 2012.\n\n\nThe urban bus fleet was partially renewed during the recovery of the national economy, since 2003, and consists of about 730 units. In 2005 the average age of the buses was five years and 11 months. Improvements in the economy have led to increased use of public transport and comparatively less use of bicycles. According to the Rosario Transportation Office, in 2005 there were about 11 million bus journeys per month,[38] by 2007, usage has climbed to 420,000 people every day (12.6 million per month).\n\n\nA significant number of buses run on natural gas, as it also happens in Argentina as a whole since the price of this fuel is quite low compared to the alternatives. The idea to transform all buses to this system did not prosper; most buses run on heavily subsidized diesel fuel.\n\n\nIn 2012 bus lanes were added to several pairs of parallel streets traversing the downtown area.[1] Bus stops along these are spaced every three blocks instead of the usual two. For the most part, they leave room to only one additional, narrow lane on the left for cars and other vehicles. They can be used for taxis carrying passengers as well. They are exclusive for public transport during weekdays and on Saturday morning; stopping or parking on the affected streets is forbidden, as well as right turns. Their implementation attracted opposition from residents and shop owners but was well received by habitual bus users since they reduce the time needed to get out of the crowded central area by a noticeable amount.[39]\n\n\nRosario has a medium-sized taxi fleet, with units painted black and outlined in yellow. Some belong to radio-taxi companies and can be reserved by telephone; others only in the streets. As the economy of Argentina recovers, the capacity of the taxi fleet has been strained by higher usage. In September 2005, the Deliberative Council approved the compulsory installation of radio-call systems in all taxi units, but this requirement has not been fulfilled.\n\n\nRosario is also a major hub for long-distance overland transportation from the Mariano Moreno Bus Terminal,[40] (*Terminal de Omnibus*), across from the Patio de la Madera Convention and Exposition Centre complex, about 15 blocks west of Plaza San Martin.\nThe transportation facility serves 73 bus companies in short, medium, and long-distance travel, carrying 1,100.000 passengers per month to 784 national and international destinations, which comprise most major domestic cities including Puerto Iguazú, Salta and Bariloche and international destinations such as Asunción, Paraguay, Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Montevideo, Uruguay, destinations may be long but white-clad chauffeurs handle comfortable long-distance coaches with modern conveniences.\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nuevo Central Argentino (NCA) freight railway yards\n![](image)Rosario Sur Station, refurbished to run inter-city services on the General Mitre Railway\n![](image)Rosario Norte\n![](image)The Center Municipal District (former Rosario Central station)\nRosario was one of the main cities chosen by the British and French railway companies that built and operated some of the railways in Argentina during the 19th and early 20th centuries, with more than 15 stations operating in the city. When the entire Argentine railway network was nationalised during the presidency of Juan Perón, most of the stations (by then under the administration of State-owned company Ferrocarriles Argentinos) were closed for passenger services to reduce costs, leaving only a few active.\n\n\nAfter the railway privatization in the early 1990s during Carlos Menem's presidency, the passenger services were considerably reduced. The lines operated by Nuevo Central Argentino (NCA) handle most of the cargo. Additionally, two private companies provided limited passenger services to several major cities. Trenes de Buenos Aires (TBA) ran weekly trains south to Retiro in Buenos Aires and north to Santa Fe. The company Ferrocentral also operated weekly trains south to Buenos Aires and northwest to Córdoba and Tucumán.\n\n\nNowadays, passenger services to Rosario are being operated by state-owned company Trenes Argentinos, running trains to Rosario Norte[41] with stop in Rosario Sur.\n\n\nThe other station in the main district, Rosario Oeste, used to concentrate all the passenger services when railways were nationalised in 1948, but currently operates for freight trains only.\n\n\nAs of June 2021, only two stations remain active for passenger services in the city. The following chart describes the total of existing railway stations in Rosario:\n\n\n\n\n\n**Railway stations in Rosario**\n| Station\n | Original company\n | Nationalised\n | Status (passenger)\n | Current operator\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rosario | Córdoba and Rosario | Belgrano | Closed (1949) [note 1] | —\n |\n| Rosario Central | Central Argentine | Mitre | Closed (1977) [note 2] | —\n |\n| Rosario Norte [note 3] | BA & Rosario | Mitre | Active | Trenes Argentinos / NCA |\n| Rosario Oeste | Córdoba Central | Belgrano | Closed (1993) | Trenes Argentinos CyL |\n| Rosario | Santa Fe Western | Mitre | Closed (1900) [note 4] | —\n |\n| Rosario | Prov.

The network is currently in the bidding process, with large firms like Siemens and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China bidding for its construction.[51] It is expected to begin at the recently inaugurated Rosario Sur Station and run northwards through the city.[52]\n\n\n\n### Roadways[edit]\n\n\nRosario is linked to the rest of the country by a number of roads: the Aramburu Highway (southeast, to Buenos Aires), National Route 9 (from Buenos Aires to Rosario and then north and west up to Jujuy and Bolivia), the Brigadier Estanislao López Highway (north, to Santa Fe City), National Route 11 (to the north of Santa Fe, Formosa and Paraguay), National Route 33 (to the southwest of Santa Fe and the province of Buenos Aires, and then through National Route 7 to San Luis, Mendoza and Chile), National Route 34 (north to Santiago del Estero, Tucumán and Bolivia), and National Route 174 (east, to Entre Ríos, over the Rosario-Victoria Bridge).\n\n\nIt is surrounded with an extensive system of two belt-highways called Circunvalación Motorway and A012 which in turn set the limits of the city.\n\n\nThe beltway is 30 km (19 mi) and was built for traffic to avoid the congested city centre, allowing drivers to bypass the city going around it in a much shorter time.\nIn its 30-kilometre (19 mi) length, it intersects with National Route 9, National Route 3, National Route 34, National Route 11 and National Route 174.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Rosario-Victoria Bridge\nThe official numbering system denotes this road as \"A008\" but this denomination is mostly unknown by the locals as it is still called \"*Avenida de Circunvalación 25 de Mayo*\" (\"*25 of May Beltway Avenue*\") commemorating the May Revolution of 1810. Some sections are named after different personalities by local decree. For example:\n\n\n\n* The section from the east end on 27 Boulevard to the crossing of Ayacucho Street (old exit to the Rosario-Buenos Aires Highway, now access to Provincial Route 21), is called *\"National Route A008 Tte. General Juan Carlos Sánchez\"* by decree #232 of 14 May 1981.\n* The section between National Route 9 and the exit to Santa Fe (the state capital) National Route 11 on the intersection with Rondeau Boulevard is called *\"National Route A008 Dr. Constantino Razzetti\"* by law #25769 of 1 September 2003.\n\n\nThe A012 is the second beltway at the southeast of the city. It has a semi-circular length centered around the city, running as a long-length beltway. From the National Route 9 junction on km marker 278, in the town of Esther, to the junction with National Route 11 on km marker 326 in the city of San Lorenzo it runs for 67 km (41.6 mi).\n\n\nThis road is popularly known as the *Second Rosario Beltway*, as it borders the metropolitan area of greater Rosario.\nThrough National Decree 1595 of 1979[53] this road switched to federal control. Beforehand this road was called Provincial Route 16.\n\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rosario International Airport\n\n![](image)Rosario International Airport\nThe Rosario – Islas Malvinas International Airport is located 13 km (8 mi) west-northwest from the center of Rosario, a city in the Santa Fe Province of Argentina. The city of Funes lies directly to the west of the airport, and part of the city limit shares a border with the property of the airport grounds. The airport covers an area of 550 hectares (1,400 acres) and is operated by the Province of Santa Fe.[54][55]\n\n\nThe airport serves the Greater Rosario area and is the main hub for Sol Líneas Aéreas and is also served by Aerolíneas Argentinas, Copa and Gol Transportes Aéreos. There are domestic flights within Argentina from Rosario to Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Mar del Plata (via Buenos Aires), Mendoza (vía Córdoba), Santa Fe and Villa Gesell (via Buenos Aires) cities as well as international services to, Porto Alegre, Brazil, and Punta del Este, Uruguay (direct flight in summer and via Buenos Aires in fall, winter and spring).\nThe airport is at an altitude of 25 metres (82 ft). Its longest runway measures 3,000 metres (9,843 ft).\n\n\n\n### Port[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Port of Rosario\n\n![](image)The Port of Rosario, c. 1910\nThe Port of Rosario is an inland port and a major goods-shipping centre of Argentina, located in the city of Rosario, province of Santa Fe, on the left-hand (western) shore of the Paraná River, about 550 km (340 mi) upstream from the Atlantic Ocean.[56][57]\n\n\nAt this point of the course of the Paraná River (Kilometer 420, Mile 260), there is the depth transition between overseas and river navigation. The main channel of the river directly in front of the port has an advantageous configuration that allows preservation of a depth of 10 metres (34 ft) with minor periodic dredging. This allows for downstream navigation of vessels up to Panamax standards. The Paraná is about 600 metres (1,970 ft) wide at Kilometer 418. It becomes 2,000 m (1.2 mi) wide downstream.\n\n\nThe port is the largest of a series located in the several cities of the Greater Rosario that lie on the Paraná; the last (northernmost) able of overseas traffic being Puerto General San Martín (23 km (14 mi). It is part of the Bi-Oceanic Corridor, which joins the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean via Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba, and the Cuyo region; going north–south it forms the axis of the Paraguay-Paraná waterway. It directly services the area of Santa Fe that produces a large portion of Argentine exports, and indirectly the whole Mercosur trade bloc. In 2003 the traffic in the port amounted to 2.9 million tonnes (3,200,000 short tons).\n\n\nCargo from other parts of Argentina is brought into the port by the railway lines of the Nuevo Central Argentino, communicating with Córdoba (west) and Zárate, Buenos Aires (south), as well as the multiple national and provincial roads and highways that converge in Rosario. Communication with the north-eastern part of the country was enhanced by the 2003 opening of the Rosario-Victoria Bridge, that joins the city with the province of Entre Ríos. The Rosario International Airport (located 15 km (9 mi) west) has also been refurbished to work with cargo traffic.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Teachers' School, on Córdoba Avenue\n![](image)National University of Rosario Law School\nRosario is an important educational centre at a national and international level. It is the home of the National University of Rosario (UNR) since 1968, which includes the Law Faculty, the Medicine Faculty, the Humanities Faculty and an advanced study centre called *Ciudad Universitaria de Rosario* (university city of Rosario) that is home to more than 10 colleges, among them the Faculty of Psychology, the Faculty of Political Sciences, and the Faculty of Architecture. It is also home of the Rosario Regional Faculty, a branch of the National Technological University (UTN). All of these national colleges are free.\n\n\nIn the city there are approximately 624 establishments destined for elementary levels and secondary education, the Technical Institute, which depends directly on the UNR. With a solid tradition as for university education, it is head of several academic institutions, and is public, and free access.\n\n\nCurrently, there are some 80,000 university students at various institutions around the city, representing approximately 8.5% of the total population. This rate is one of the highest in Argentina. In Rosario, nearly 15% of the population benefits from higher education degrees, or have undergone at least some university studies.\n\n\nRosario has private colleges, as the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina (UCA), the Austral University, the University of the Latin American Educational Center (UCEL), the Interamerican Open University (UAI), the Italian University of Rosario (IUNIR), the San Martin University and the University of Concepcion del Uruguay which are private institutions.\n\n\n\n## Language[edit]\n\n\nRosario is the third largest urban center where Rioplatense Spanish is spoken, after Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The local language evidences the typical linguistic features that characterize this dialect, notably the voseo (use of *vos* instead of *tú* as pronoun for the second person singular) and the *sheísmo* (form of yeísmo where *ll-* and *y-* are pronounced as a voiceless [ʃ]). Although the *español rosarino* does not differ substantially from the other variants of the same dialect, it presents particularities easily noticeable by those who live in the other main populated areas of the region.\n\n\nOne of the most notable characteristics of the language of Rosario's area of influence is the process of aspiration and disappearance of the *-s*. When the *-s* is in implosive position, end of syllable or word followed by consonant, its sound becomes a soft and voiceless aspiration [h] (the word *obispo* is pronounced **o̞ˈβihpo̞**). In the popular and vulgar language, the final *-s*, *-r*, or *-d* are sometimes suppressed, although this phenomenon is commonly associated to sociocultural groups of lower formal education.[58]\n\n\nJust as in Buenos Aires, the *voseo* is pronominal and verbal. The pronoun *tú* and its associated verbal forms are inexistent (which is not the case of the Montevideo variant) The tendency to add a final *-s* to the verbal forms of the second person plural (*vos fuistes*, *vos vinistes*), which is rather common in Buenos Aires, is very unusual among Rosario natives.\n\n\nEven though the lexicon of Rosario and Buenos Aires is effectively identical, there are numerous terms and idioms that Rosario shares with the rest of the country (even areas where a different dialect prevails) but not with the capital, as well as other words and expressions that are unique to the *rosarino* speech, both formal and informal.\n\n\nThe *Rosarigasino* is a type of Jerigonza (game of words) that originated in the city and was rather common in the informal speech during the 20th century. Although it has fallen into disuse, it has become a language of cult among certain local groups.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lionel Messi, born in Rosario in 1987\nRosario is the home of the football clubs Rosario Central (founded 1889) and Newell's Old Boys (founded 1903). Both play in Primera División Argentina. Central has won four National championships (in 1971, 1973, 1980 and in 1987), six National cups (1913, 1915, two cups in 1916, 1920 and 2018),[59][60] and one international title: the Conmebol Cup (in 1995, precursor of the current Copa Sudamericana).[61][62][63][64][65][66]\nNewell's has 6 National championships (in 1974, 1988, 1991, 1992, 2004 and in 2013) and 3 National cups (in 1911, 1921 and in 1949). Rosario's other football clubs are Club Atlético Central Córdoba, currently playing in Primera C, Club Atlético Tiro Federal Argentino in Torneo Argentino A and Argentino de Rosario in Primera D.\n\n\nIt is also the hometown of Argentine internationals Lionel Messi, Ángel Di María, Maximiliano Rodríguez, César Delgado, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Mauro Icardi, Giovani Lo Celso, Leandro Fernández, Ezequiel Garay, Luciana Aymar, Juan Imhoff, Ángel Correa, Nicolás Vergallo and Leonardo Senatore.\n\n\nThe city received international attention as the host of the II South American Games in 1982, as one of the host cities of the 1978 FIFA World Cup, the 1982 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship, the 1993 FIVB Volleyball Men's U21 World Championship, the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship and the 1990 Basketball World Cup.[67] Rosario also bid for the 2019 Pan American Games but the Argentine Olympic Committee (COA) voted to support La Punta instead.[68]\n\n\nRosario is the second choice site for Argentine rugby tests, after Buenos Aires. Famous rugby clubs from the city include Club Atlético del Rosario – one of the four UAR founding clubs – and also Jockey Club de Rosario and Duendes Rugby Club, both former winners of the Nacional de Clubes title. The city hosted the 2010 IRB Junior World Championship.\n\n\nThe 2010 Women's Hockey World Cup, 2004 and 2012 Champions Trophy and the 2014–15 Women's FIH Hockey World League Final were played there.\n\n\nIn 2014 the city hosted the Inline speed skating World Championship at Parque de la Independencia[69] and in 2015 it hosted the men's, women's and juniors' FIRS Inline Hockey World Championships at Club Atlético Provincial's indoor arena.[70]\n\n\nRosario hosted the 2017 World Archery Youth Championships, and will host the 2018 FIBA Under-17 Basketball World Cup, and the 2019 South American Beach Games.\n\n\n\n### Motorsports[edit]\n\n\nThe city was the starting point for the 2014 Dakar Rally, as well as the finishing point in 2016. It also hosted the 2015 World RX of Argentina.\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Participants carry the national colors on Flag Day (June 20).\n* *Festival Latinoamericano de Video Rosario* (Rosario Latin American Video Festival). Annual event (September), starting in 1994.\n* *Encuentro Internacional de Escultura en Madera-Piedra-Hierro de Rosario* (International Meeting of Wood-Stone-Iron Sculpture in Rosario). Annual event (September/October), since 1993.\n* *Encuentro y Fiesta Nacional de Colectividades* (Communities Meeting and National Celebration). Annual event, starting in 1985, showcasing music, song, dance, cuisine and customs of foreign communities in Argentina, in the ample room provided by the *Parque Nacional a la Bandera* (National Flag Park). Usually held in November; in 2004 it was postponed to the beginning of December in order to avoid overlap with the Third International Congress of the Spanish Language.\n* *Festival Internacional de Poesía de Rosario* (International Poetry Festival). Annual event since 1993 (November).\n* *Festival Iberoamericano de Cine de Rosario* (Ibero-American Film Festival). Annual event since 2003 (November).\n* *Leyendas* (\"Legends\"). A cartoon, role-playing and science fiction convention. Annually since 1999, usually in autumn (April/May), sometimes in spring (November).\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Rosario\n\n![](image)Rosario metropolitan area in the Province of Santa Fe\nThe city of Rosario measures 178.69 km2 (69.0 sq mi), not all of them are fully urbanized. Its extreme points are:\n\n\n\n* Latitude: parallels 32°52′18″ and 33°02′22″ South.\n* Longitude: meridians 60°36′44″ and 60°47′46″ West.\n\n\nThe geographical center is approximately at 32°57′2″S 60°42′15″W﻿ / ﻿32.95056°S 60.70417°W﻿ / -32.95056; -60.70417\n\n\nThe city is located on a smoothly undulated plain typical of the Pampas, between 22.5 and 24.6 metres above mean sea level; the original settlement rests on the ravine on the right-hand shore of the Paraná, opposite a group of islands of the Paraná Delta which are partly in the jurisdiction of the province of Entre Ríos. The nearest city across the river's flood plain (60 km) is Victoria, Entre Ríos, linked to Rosario by the Rosario-Victoria Bridge.\n\n\nRosario lies on the ravine of the right-hand shore of the Paraná, about 24 metres (79 ft) above mean sea level, in a place with a natural slope to the low shore. The point of origin of the city is *Plaza 25 de Mayo* (\"May 25 Square\"), now surrounded by the municipality (*Palacio de los Leones*), the Basilica Cathedral of Our Lady of the Rosary, the Central Post Office, the Decorative Art Museum and a building called *La Bola de Nieve* (\"The Snowball\"). Between the Cathedral and the municipal building is *Pasaje Juramento* (\"Oath Passage\"), leading to the Flag Memorial. The streets mostly follow a regular checkerboard pattern.\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Climate chart\nThe Rosario area has a *Pampean*, humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa/Cwa),[71] and is well known for its changeable weather conditions. The city has average temperatures of 23.7 °C (74.7 °F) maximum and 11.8 °C (53.2 °F) minimum. The annual rainfall is 1,038 mm (40.9 in).\n\n\nRosario is usually warmer than other mainland Argentine capital cities in the winter. The lowest average in winter is 4.4 °C (40 °F). This is due in part to the city's flat topography, its situation on the Paraná River bank, and the presence of high density of urbanization. Those conditions have created a microclimate known as urban heat island that often means that the city is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas.\n\n\nThe temperature difference usually is larger at night than during the day and larger in winter than in summer, and is most apparent when winds are weak. However, snowfalls are extremely rare: the most recent occurrence of sleet in the CBD was on 9 July 2007.\nDuring the spring, Rosario commonly enjoys extended periods of warm weather and clear skies. On average, Rosario has average day-night temperatures of 23–10 °C (73–50 °F). The city experiences hot and humid summer days, with maximum temperatures above 35 °C (95 °F), when northerly winds blow humid air from Brazil. The record high temperature is 40.5 °C (104.9 °F) on January 9, 2006, while the record low is −8.4 °C (17 °F) on July 15, 2020.[72]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Rosario (Islas Malvinas Airport), elevation: 25 m, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1875–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n | 39.3(102.7)\n | 37.0(98.6)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 37.3(99.1)\n | 38.0(100.4)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 30.9(87.6)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 27.7(81.9)\n | 23.9(75.0)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 17.0(62.6)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 29.8(85.6)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 17.8(64.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | 4.9(40.8)\n | 6.3(43.3)\n | 8.7(47.7)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | −0.9(30.4)\n | −6.1(21.0)\n | −8.1(17.4)\n | −8.4(16.9)\n | −7.8(18.0)\n | −4.8(23.4)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n | 5.1(41.2)\n | −8.4(16.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 120.7(4.75)\n | 127.4(5.02)\n | 138.4(5.45)\n | 119.9(4.72)\n | 57.7(2.27)\n | 28.3(1.11)\n | 23.0(0.91)\n | 35.3(1.39)\n | 48.0(1.89)\n | 118.7(4.67)\n | 108.2(4.26)\n | 127.9(5.04)\n | 1,053.5(41.48)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 7.3\n | 7.7\n | 7.4\n | 8.5\n | 5.3\n | 4.5\n | 4.2\n | 3.6\n | 5.3\n | 8.9\n | 8.2\n | 9.0\n | 79.8\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 67.8\n | 72.8\n | 75.4\n | 78.1\n | 81.0\n | 80.9\n | 77.9\n | 72.6\n | 68.5\n | 69.3\n | 65.6\n | 65.5\n | 73.0\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 297.6\n | 240.1\n | 235.6\n | 183.0\n | 173.6\n | 147.0\n | 173.6\n | 195.3\n | 195.0\n | 223.2\n | 267.0\n | 288.3\n | 2,619.3\n |\n| Mean daily sunshine hours | 9.6\n | 8.5\n | 7.6\n | 6.1\n | 5.6\n | 4.9\n | 5.6\n | 6.3\n | 6.5\n | 7.2\n | 8.9\n | 9.3\n | 7.2\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 73\n | 71\n | 64\n | 64\n | 58\n | 50\n | 52\n | 59\n | 56\n | 58\n | 65\n | 65\n | 61\n |\n| Source 1: Servicio Meteorológico Nacional[73][74][75] |\n| Source 2: Meteo Climat (record highs and lows),[76] Oficina de Riesgo Agropecuario (March/April/October/November/December record highs, and July/September/October/December record low),[77] UNLP (percent sun 1971–1980)[78] |\n\n## Broadcasting and communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rosario offices of Telecom Argentina\n![](image)Headquarters of *La Capital* newspaper\nRosario has two private local television channels, Canal 3 and Canal 5 (the latter is part of the national network Telefé), and a relay station for the public national station, Canal 7 Argentina. There are also three cable TV networks (the national ones Cablevisión and Multicanal, and a local network, Cablehogar), which support two local channels, Canal 4 Noticias and Canal 6.\n\n\nThere are four AM radio stations: three private (licensed by the state) ones, LT3 Radio 2 (LT2), and LT8, and one public, Radio Nacional Rosario, property of the national state. Among the multitude (above 200) of FM stations, some notable ones are FM Vida, Estación del Siglo, FM Del Rosario, Cristal FM, Radio Hollywood, Fisherton-CNN, Continental Rosario, Radio 10 Rosario, Radiofónica, and Clásica Rosario.\n\n\nThe city has three notable newspapers: *La Capital* (Argentina's oldest newspaper, founded in 1867, and still published today), *Rosario/12* (founded in 1991), and *El Ciudadano & La Región* (founded in 1999).\n\n\nRosario is located at the center of Argentina's optical fiber ring. The main data transport companies offer all their services in the city, from public phones to mobile networks and broadband Internet access through DSL, cable modem and Wi-Fi, and including public Internet navigation centers (cybercafes).\n\n\nAbout 96% of homes have a domestic telephone line, giving a total of 472,170 lines; cell phone usage has also become pervasive, as happened in Argentina as a whole since the beginning of the 21st century, reaching over 86% of the residents (866,000 mobile lines in July 2004). This demand, boosted by low prices and sale promotions, and coupled with restrictions on the installation of antennas and alleged lack of investment by the providers, sometimes degrades the quality of the service. Most notably, the mobile network collapsed almost completely in the celebrations of Christmas, New Year's Day and Friend's Day in 2004 and 2005.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nNotable people from Rosario include the following:\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Luciana Aymar, field hockey player\n* Gato Barbieri, jazz composer\n* Antonio Berni, painter\n* Marcelo Bielsa, football coach\n* Emiliano Boffelli, rugby union player\n* Felipe Martinez Carbonell, film director[79]\n* Ángel Correa, football player\n* José Cura, operatic tenor[80][81]\n* Ángel Di María, football player\n* Lucio Fontana, artist\n* Roberto Fontanarrosa, cartoonist\n* Angélica Gorodischer, writer\n* Che Guevara, revolutionary\n* Hugo Gutiérrez, football player\n* Jana Rodriguez Hertz, mathematician\n* Mauro Icardi, football player\n | * Juan Imhoff, rugby union player\n* Libertad Lamarque, actress\n* Giovanni Lo Celso, football player\n* Gerardo Martino, football player and coach\n* Valeria Mazza, model\n* Yamile Saied Mendez, writer\n* César Luis Menotti, football coach\n* Lionel Messi, football player\n* Alberto Olmedo, actor/comedian\n* Fito Páez, singer-songwriter\n* Patricio Pron, writer\n* Maximiliano Rodríguez, football player\n* Leonardo Senatore, rugby union player\n* Dorothy Wrinch, mathematician and biochemical theorist\n* Alberto Demiddi, rower\n* Juan Carlos Baglietto, singer\n\n\n |\n\n* ![Libertad Lamarque](image)\n\nLibertad Lamarque\n* ![Che Guevara](image)\n\nChe Guevara\n* ![Ángel Di María](image)\n\nÁngel Di María\n* ![Lionel Messi](image)\n\nLionel Messi\n* ![Luciana Aymar](image)\n\nLuciana Aymar\n* ![Marcelo Bielsa](image)\n\nMarcelo Bielsa\n* ![Valeria Mazza](image)\n\nValeria Mazza\n* ![Juan Imhoff](image)\n\nJuan Imhoff\n* ![Felipe Martinez Carbonell](image)\n\nFelipe Martinez Carbonell\n\n\n## Twin towns – sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Argentina\n\nRosario is twinned with:[82]\n\n\n\n* ![Italy](image) Alessandria, Italy\n* ![Kazakhstan](image) Almaty, Kazakhstan\n* ![Paraguay](image) Asunción, Paraguay\n* ![Spain](image) Bilbao, Spain\n* ![Venezuela](image) Caracas, Venezuela\n* ![Ecuador](image) Cuenca, Ecuador\n* ![Senegal](image) Dakar, Senegal\n* ![Israel](image) Haifa, Israel\n* ![Italy](image) Imperia, Italy\n* ![Kuwait](image) Kuwait City, Kuwait\n* ![Colombia](image) Manizales, Colombia\n* ![Colombia](image) Medellín, Colombia\n* ![Mexico](image) Monterrey, Mexico\n* ![Uruguay](image) Montevideo, Uruguay\n* ![Greece](image) Piraeus, Greece\n* ![Peru](image) Pisco, Peru\n* ![Brazil](image) Porto Alegre, Brazil\n* ![China](image) Shanghai, China\n* ![Cuba](image) Santa Clara, Cuba\n* ![Bolivia](image) Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia\n* ![Cuba](image) Santiago de Cuba, Cuba\n* ![Dominican Republic](image) Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n* ![United States](image) St. Louis, United States\n* ![Italy](image) Turin, Italy\n* ![Chile](image) Valparaíso, Chile\n\n### Cooperation agreements[edit]\n\n\nRosario also cooperates with:[83]\n\n\n\n* ![Chile](image) Viña del Mar, Chile\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Argentina portal\n\n\n* History of Rosario\n* Port of Rosario\n* Geography of Rosario\n* Government of Rosario\n* Districts of Rosario\n* Olinto Gallo Workshops\n* Palacio Cabanellas\n* Parana River steamers\n* Rondeau Boulevard\n* 2013 Rosario gas explosion\n* Fernando Traverso's Bicis\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Sitio de la Municipalidad de Rosario\". *Sitio de la Municipalidad de Rosario*.\n2. **^** Página del Ministerio de Educación de la Nación sobre el Monumento Histórico Nacional a la Bandera.
