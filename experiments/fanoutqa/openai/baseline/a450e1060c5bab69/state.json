On its first day of trading, the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00 suggesting an initial under-valuing of the company. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America and Australia, to expand and improve production and research and development, and to increase working capital.[10]\n\n\nBy 1996, Lenovo was the market leader in China and began selling its own laptop.[15] By 1998 it held 43 per cent of the domestic computer market share in China, selling approximately one million computers.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, Lenovo became the first personal computer manufacturer to divide countries into emerging markets and mature markets. Lenovo then developed a different set of strategies for each category. Lenovo's competitors have widely adopted the same approach[20] In 2012, Lenovo made a major effort to expand its market share in developing economies such as Brazil and India through acquisitions and increased budgets for marketing and advertising.[79]\n\n\n\n### Celebrity sponsorships and endorsements[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n121. **^** \"Google sells Motorola to Lenovo for $2.91 billion\". *The Verge*. 29 January 2014.

As of January 2013, shipments of THINK-branded computers have doubled since Lenovo's takeover of the brand, with profit margins thought to be above 5%.[79] Lenovo aggressively expanded the THINK brand away from traditional laptop computers in favor of tablets and hybrid devices such as the ThinkPad Tablet 2, ThinkPad Yoga, ThinkPad 8, ThinkPad Helix, and ThinkPad Twist; the shift came as a response to the growing popularity of mobile devices, and the release of Windows 8 in October 2012. Lenovo achieved significant success with this high-value strategy and in 2013 controlled more than 40% of the market for Windows computers priced above $900 in the United States.[80]\n\n\n\n#### ThinkPad[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTo fund its continued growth, Lenovo issued a secondary offering of 50 million shares on the Hong Kong market in March 2000 and raised about US$212 million.[10] It rebranded to the name Lenovo in 2003 and began making acquisitions to expand the company.[15]\n\n\nLenovo acquired IBM's personal computer business in 2005, including the ThinkPad laptop and ThinkCentre desktop lines.[18] Lenovo's acquisition of IBM's personal computer division accelerated access to foreign markets while improving Lenovo's branding and technology.[19] Lenovo paid US$1.25 billion for IBM's computer business and assumed an additional US$500 million of IBM's debt. This acquisition made Lenovo the third-largest computer maker worldwide by volume.[20]\nLenovo's purchase of the Think line from IBM also led to the creation of the IBM/Lenovo partnership, which works together in the creation of Think-line of products sold by Lenovo.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** Trivedi, Anjani (3 June 2015). \"Lenovo Heats Up Hong Kong's Dim-Sum Bond Market\". *The Wall Street Journal*.

Lenovo also doubled-down on vertical integration and manufacturing near target markets in order to cut costs at time when its competitors were making increased use of outsourcing off-shoring.

ThinkPads will be produced by NEC in Yamagata Prefecture. Akemi Watanabe (\u6e21\u8fba\u6731\u7f8e, *Watanabe Akemi*), president of Lenovo Japan, said, \"As a Japanese, I am glad to see the return to domestic production and the goal is to realize full-scale production as this will improve our image and make the products more acceptable to Japanese customers.\"[148][150]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### Liu Chuanzhi[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Liu Chuanzhi\n\nLiu Chuanzhi is the founder and former chairman of Lenovo. Liu was trained as an engineer at a military college and later went on to work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Like many young people during the Cultural Revolution, Liu was denounced and sent to the countryside where he worked as a laborer on a rice farm. Liu claims Hewlett-Packard as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with *The Economist* he stated that \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.[188] In reference to Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"[14]\n\n\n\n#### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThroughout the years, Lenovo's presence in Singapore has transitioned from its early establishment to a dynamic and forward-looking operation.

Lenovo surpassed Apple Inc. to become the No.\u00a02 provider of smartphones in the domestic Chinese market in 2012.[40] However, with approximately 100 smartphone brands sold in China, this only equated to a 10.4% market share.[40]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Lenovo announced an investment of US$793 million in the construction of a mobile phone manufacturing and R&D facility in Wuhan, Hubei.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** \"IBM and Lenovo \u2013 United States\". *www.ibm.com*. 8 October 2012.

In April 2003, the company publicly announced its new English name, \"Lenovo\", with an advertising campaign including huge billboards and primetime television ads. Lenovo spent 18 million RMB on an eight-week television advertising campaign. The billboards showed the Lenovo logo against blue sky with a slogan that read, \"Transcendence depends on how you think.\" By the end of 2003, Lenovo had spent a total of 200 million RMB on rebranding.[10]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLenovo is a manufacturer of personal computers, smartphones, televisions, and wearable devices. Some of the company's earliest products included the KT8920 mainframe computer[10] and a circuit board that allowed IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters.[14] One of its first computers was the Tianxi (\u5929\u79a7), released in 1998 in the Chinese market. It became the best selling computer in Chinese history in 2000.[17]\n\n\n\n### Personal and business computing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiu Chuanzhi received government permission to form a subsidiary in Hong Kong and to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong along with Lui, furthered his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. To save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. To keep up appearances, they rented hotel rooms for meetings.[10]\n\n\nIn 1990, Lenovo started to manufacture and market computers using its own brand name.[14] Some of the company's early successes included the KT8920 mainframe computer.[10] It also developed a circuit board that allowed IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters.[14]\n\n\n\n### 1994\u20131998: IPO, second offerings and bond sales[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Technology Research Institute New Technology Development Company.[10] Lenovo has increasingly diversified from the personal computer market and made a number of corporate acquisitions, with the most notable being acquiring and integrating most of IBM's personal computer business and its x86-based server business as well as creating its own smartphone.[13]\n\n\nThe organizational structure of the company was established in 1985 after the Chinese New Year. It included technology, engineering, administrative, and office departments.[10] The group first attempted to import televisions but failed. It rebuilt itself as a company doing quality checks on computers.

Data from Analysys International shows that Lenovo experienced considerable growth in smartphone sales in China during 2012. Specifically, it saw its market share increase to 14.2% during 2012's third quarter, representing an increase when compared to 4.8% in the same quarter of 2011. IDC analysts said that Lenovo's success is due to its \"aggressive ramping-up and improvements in channel partnerships\". Analysys International analyst Wang Ying wrote, \"Lenovo possesses an obvious advantage over rivals in terms of sales channels.\" The company's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, said, \"Lenovo does not want to be the second player ... we want to be the best.

Being added to the Hang Seng Index was a significant boon for Lenovo and its shareholders as it widened the pool of investors willing to purchase Lenovo's stock. For instance, index funds pegged to the Hang Seng and pension funds that consider index inclusion now have the opportunity to invest in Lenovo.[174] In November 2013 Lenovo reported that they had achieved double-digit market share in the United States for the first time.[175]\n\n\n\n### Ownership[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLenovo has had a presence in Singapore as early as its foundation, and with a focus on the Southeast Asia region, it is the location of one of Lenovo's three head offices.[207] Registered as Lenovo[208] (Singapore) Pte.

The HP Garage at 367 Addison Avenue is now designated an official California Historical Landmark, and is marked with a plaque calling it the \"Birthplace of 'Silicon Valley'\".\n\n\nThe company won its first big contract in 1938 to provide the HP 200A, a low distortion frequency oscillator[1] for Walt Disney's production of the animated film *Fantasia*, which allowed Hewlett and Packard to formally establish the Hewlett-Packard Company on July 2, 1939.[2] The company grew into a multinational corporation widely respected for its products. HP was the world's leading PC manufacturer from 2007 until the second quarter of 2013, when Lenovo moved ahead of HP.[3][4][5] HP specialized in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage, and networking hardware; designing software; and delivering services. Major product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, networking products, software, and a range of printers and other imaging products. The company directly marketed its products to households; small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises, as well as via online distribution; consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers; software partners; and major technology vendors. It also offered services and a consulting business for its products and partner products.\n\n\nIn 1999, HP spun off its electronic and bio-analytical test and measurement instruments business into Agilent Technologies; HP retained focus on its later products, including computers and printers. It merged with Compaq in 2002, and acquired Electronic Data Systems in 2008, which led to combined revenues of $118.4\u00a0billion that year and a Fortune 500 ranking of 9 in 2009. In November 2009, HP announced its acquisition of 3Com,[6] and closed the deal on April 12, 2010.[7] On April 28, 2010, HP announced its buyout of Palm, Inc. for $1.2\u00a0billion.[8] On September 2, 2010, HP won its bidding war for 3PAR with a $33 a share offer ($2.07\u00a0billion), which Dell declined to match.[9]\n\n\nOn November 1, 2015, Hewlett-Packard was split into two separate companies; its enterprise products and services business were spun-off to form Hewlett Packard Enterprise, while its personal computer and printer businesses became HP Inc.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The garage in Palo Alto, where Hewlett and Packard began the company\n\n![Logo used from 1941 to 1964](image)Logo used from 1941 to 1964\n\nBill Hewlett and David Packard graduated with degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1935. The company started in a garage in Palo Alto during a fellowship they had with past professor Frederick Terman at Stanford during the Great Depression, whom they considered a mentor in forming the company.[11] In 1938, Packard and Hewlett began part-time work in a rented garage with an initial capital investment of US$538 (equivalent to $11,645 in 2023). In 1939, Hewlett and Packard decided to formalize their partnership. They tossed a coin to decide whether the company they founded would be called Hewlett-Packard (HP) or Packard-Hewlett.[12]\n\n\nHewlett and Packard's first financially successful product was a precision audio oscillator known as the HP 200A, which used a small incandescent light bulb (known as a \"pilot light\") as a temperature dependent resistor in a critical portion of the circuit, and a negative feedback loop to stabilize the amplitude of the output sinusoidal waveform. This allowed the HP 200A to be sold for $89.40 when competitors were selling less stable oscillators for over $200. The 200 series of generators continued production until at least 1972 as the 200AB, still tube-based but improved in design through the years.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOne of the company's earliest customers was Bud Hawkins, chief sound engineer for Walt Disney Studios, who bought eight HP 200B audio oscillators (at $71.50 each) to be used in the animated film *Fantasia*. HP's profit at the end of 1939, its first full year of business, was $1,563 (equivalent to $34,236 in 2023) on revenues of $5,369.[13]\n\n\nIn 1942, they built their first building at 395 Page Mill Road and were awarded the Army-Navy \"E\" Award in 1943. HP employed 200 people and produced the audio oscillator, a wave analyzer, distortion analyzers, an audio-signal generator, and the Model 400A vacuum-tube voltmeter during the war.[13]:\u200a54\u201360,\u200a195\n\n\nHewlett and Packard worked on counter-radar technology and artillery shell proximity fuzes during World War II; the work exempted Packard from the draft,[14] but Hewlett had to serve as an officer in the Army Signal Corps after being called to active duty.\n\n\nHP was incorporated on August 18, 1947, with Packard as president. Sales reached $5.5 million in 1951 with 215 employees. The company went public on November 6, 1957.[13]:\u200a35,\u200a40,\u200a64,\u200a70,\u200a196 In 1959, a manufacturing plant was established in B\u00f6blingen and a marketing organization in Geneva.[13]:\u200a196 Packard handed the presidency over to Hewlett when he became chairman in 1964, but remained CEO of the company.\n\n\n\n### 1960s[edit]\n\n\n\n![Logo used from 1964[15] to 1979](image)Logo used from 1964[15] to 1979\n\n![](image)The HP200A, a precision audio oscillator, was the company's very first financially successful product.\nHP is recognized as the symbolic founder of Silicon Valley, though it did not actively investigate semiconductor devices until a few years after the \"traitorous eight\" abandoned William Shockley to create Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957. Hewlett-Packard's HP Associates division, established around 1960, developed semiconductor devices primarily for internal use. HP Associates was co-founded by another former Bell Labs researcher, MOSFET inventor Mohamed Atalla,[16] who served as Director of Semiconductor Research.[17] Instruments and calculators were some of the products using semiconductor devices from HP Associates.\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, HP partnered with Sony and Yokogawa Electric in Japan to develop several high-quality products. The products were not a huge success, as there were high costs involved in building HP-looking products in Japan. In 1963, HP and Yokogawa formed the joint venture Yokogawa-Hewlett-Packard to market HP products in Japan.[18] HP bought Yokogawa Electric's share of Hewlett-Packard Japan in 1999.[19]\n\n\nHP spun off the small company Dynac to specialize in digital equipment. The name was picked so that the HP logo could be turned upside down to be a reflected image of the logo of the new company. Dynac was eventually renamed Dymec and folded back into HP in 1959.[20] HP experimented with using Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) minicomputers with its instruments, but entered the computer market in 1966 with the HP 2100 / HP 1000 series of minicomputers after it decided that it would be easier to build another small design team than deal with DEC. The minicomputers had a simple accumulator-based design with two accumulator registers and, in the HP 1000 models, two index registers. The series was produced for 20 years in spite of several attempts to replace it, and was a forerunner of the HP 9800 and HP 250 series of desktop and business computers.\n\n\nAt the end of 1968, Packard handed over the duties of CEO to Hewlett to become United States Deputy Secretary of Defense in the incoming Nixon administration. He resumed the chairmanship in 1972 and served until 1993, but Hewlett remained the CEO.\n\n\n\n### 1970s[edit]\n\n\nThe HP 3000 was an advanced stack-based design for a business computing server, later redesigned with RISC technology. The HP 2640 series of smart and intelligent terminals introduced forms-based interfaces to ASCII terminals, and also introduced screen labeled function keys, now commonly used on gas pumps and bank ATMs. The HP 2640 series included one of the first bit mapped graphics displays that, when combined with the HP 2100 21MX F-Series microcoded Scientific Instruction Set,[21] enabled the first commercial WYSIWYG presentation program, BRUNO, that later became the program HP-Draw on the HP 3000. Although scoffed at in the formative days of computing, HP surpassed IBM as the world's largest technology vendor in terms of sales.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)Introduced in 1968, \"The new Hewlett-Packard 9100A personal computer is ready, willing, and able\u00a0... to relieve you of waiting to get on the big computer.\"\nHP was identified by *Wired* magazine as the producer of the world's first device to be called a personal computer: the Hewlett-Packard 9100A, introduced in 1968.[23] HP called it a desktop calculator because, as Hewlett said: \"If we had called it a computer, it would have been rejected by our customers' computer gurus because it didn't look like an IBM. We therefore decided to call it a calculator, and all such nonsense disappeared.\" An engineering triumph at the time, the logic circuit was produced without any integrated circuits, and the CPU assembly was entirely executed in discrete components. With CRT display, magnetic-card storage, and printer, the price was around $5,000. The machine's keyboard was a cross between the keyboard of a scientific calculator and the keyboard of an adding machine. There was no alphabetic keyboard.\n\n\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak originally designed the Apple I computer while working at HP and offered it to them under their right of first refusal to his work; they did not take it up as the company wanted to stay in scientific, business, and industrial markets. Wozniak said that HP \"turned him down five times\", but that his loyalty to HP made him hesitant to start Apple with Steve Jobs.[24]\n\n\nThe company earned global respect for a variety of products. They introduced the world's first handheld scientific electronic calculator in 1972 (the HP-35), the first handheld programmable in 1974 (the HP-65), the first alphanumeric, programmable, expandable in 1979 (the HP-41C), and the first symbolic and graphing calculator, the HP-28C. \n\n\nLike their scientific and business calculators, HP oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and other measurement instruments had a reputation for sturdiness and usability. HP introduced the Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus (HPIB) computer peripheral interface (later cloned by National Instruments as GPIB and standardized by the IEEE as IEEE-488) on their relay actuator products in 1973; HPIB was later integrated into most high end test & measurement equipment it produced from 1980 onward. As early as 1977 HP began production of the HP856x spectrum analyzers to complement its RF power meters and sensors capable of measuring signals in excess of 20 GHz. HP also produced configurable chassis based sweep generators capable of generating signals to 20GHz. Other T&M products of the time included lab grade multimeters, microwave frequency counters, RF amplifiers, high accuracy microwave detectors, lab grade power supplies and more. These products were succeeded by modernized versions as well as the introduction of the scalar and vector network analyzer product lines prior to the business being spun off into Agilent Technologies.\n\n\nThe HP 9800 series of technical desktop computers started in 1971 with the 9810A. The HP series 80 started in 1979 with the 85.[25] Some of these machines used a version of the BASIC programming language, which was available immediately after they were switched on, and used a proprietary magnetic tape for storage. HP computers were similar in capabilities to the much later IBM Personal Computer, though the limitations of available technology forced prices to be high.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1978, Hewlett stepped down as CEO and was succeeded by John A. Young.\n\n\n\n### 1980s[edit]\n\n\n\n![Logo used from 1979 to 2008](image)Logo used from 1979 to 2008\n\nHP expanded into South Africa in the 1980s. Activists supporting divestment from South Africa accused HP of \"automating apartheid\".[26]\n\n\nSales reached $6.5 billion in 1985 with 85,000 employees.[13]:\u200a198\n\n\nIn 1984, HP introduced both inkjet and laser printers for the desktop. Along with its scanner product line, the printers have later been developed into successful multifunction products, the most significant being single-unit printer/scanner/copier/fax machines. The print mechanisms in HP's LaserJet line of laser printers depend almost entirely on Canon Inc.'s components (print engines), which in turn use technology developed by Xerox. HP developed the hardware, firmware, and software to convert data into dots for printing.[27]\n\n\nOn March 3, 1986, HP registered the HP.com domain name, making it the ninth Internet .com domain to be registered.[28]\n\n\nIn 1987, the Palo Alto garage where Hewlett and Packard started their business was designated as a California Historical Landmark.\n\n\n\n### 1990s[edit]\n\n\n\n![Logo with \"Invent\" tagline introduced in 1999[29]](image)Logo with \"Invent\" tagline introduced in 1999[29]\n\nIn the 1990s, HP expanded their computer product line, which initially had been targeted at university, research, and business users, to reach consumers. HP also grew through acquisitions: it bought Apollo Computer in 1989 and Convex Computer in 1995.\n\n\nIn 1992, Young was succeeded by Lewis E. Platt, and in 1993 and Hewlett and Packard stepped down from the board with Platt succeeding Packard as chairman.\n\n\nIn 1993, HP acquired Advanced Design System from Pathwave. The ADS suite of RF simulation tools was spun off into Agilent in 1999 along with related T&M business units, all of which were carried forward into the spinoff of Agilent into Keysight.\n\n\nLater in the decade, HP opened hpshopping.com as an independent subsidiary to sell online, direct to consumers; in 2005, the store was renamed \"HP Home & Home Office Store\".\n\n\nFrom 1995 to 1998, Hewlett-Packard were sponsors of the English football team Tottenham Hotspur.\n\n\nIn 1999, all of the businesses not related to computers, storage, and imaging were spun off from HP to form Agilent Technologies. Agilent's spin-off was the largest initial public offering in the history of Silicon Valley,[30] and it created an $8 billion company with about 30,000 employees, manufacturing scientific instruments, semiconductors, optical networking devices, and electronic test equipment for telecom and wireless, research and development, and production.\n\n\nIn July 1999, HP appointed Carly Fiorina as the first female CEO of a Fortune-20 company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[31] Fiorina received a larger signing offer than any of her predecessors.[32] The same year, Fiorina articulated a set of \"rules of the garage\", an attempt to capture the spirit of the company's founders.[33]\n\n\n\n#### Sales to Iran despite sanctions[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997, HP started selling its products in Iran through a European subsidiary and a Dubai-based Middle Eastern distributor, despite U.S. export sanctions prohibiting such deals imposed by Bill Clinton's 1995 executive orders.[34][35][36] The story was initially reported by *The Boston Globe*,[37] and it triggered an inquiry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). HP responded that products worth US$120 million were sold in fiscal year 2008[38] for distribution via Redington Gulf, a company based in the Netherlands, and that as these sales took place through a foreign subsidiary, HP had not violated sanctions.[34]\n\n\nHP named Redington Gulf \"Wholesaler of the Year\" in 2003, which in turn published a press release stating that \"[t]he seeds of the Redington-Hewlett-Packard relationship were sowed six years ago for one market\u00a0\u2014 Iran.\"[34] At the time, Redington Gulf had only three employees whose sole purpose was to sell HP products to the Iran market.[37] According to former officials who worked on sanctions, HP used a loophole by routing their sales through a foreign subsidiary.[34] HP ended its relationship with Redington Gulf after the SEC inquiry.[34]\n\n\n\n### 2000\u20132005[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hewlett-Packard Deskjet 3845 printer\nOn September 3, 2001, HP announced that an agreement had been reached with Compaq to merge the two companies.[39] In May 2002, after passing a shareholder vote, HP officially merged with Compaq. Prior to this, plans had been in place to consolidate the companies' product teams and product lines.[40]\n\n\nAs Compaq took over Tandem Computers in 1997 and Digital Equipment Corporation in 1998, HP offers support for the former Tandem NonStop family and Digital Equipment products PDP-11, VAX and AlphaServer.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nThe merger occurred after a proxy fight with Bill Hewlett's son Walter, who objected to the merger. HP became a major producer in desktop computers, laptops, and servers for many different markets. After the merger with Compaq, the new ticker symbol became \"HPQ\", a combination of the two previous symbols, \"HWP\" and \"CPQ\", to show the significance of the alliance and also key letters from the two companies **H**ewlett-**P**ackard and Compa**q** (the latter company being famous for its \"Q\" logo on all of its products).\n\n\nMscape was a mobile media gaming platform that could be used to create location-based games originating in 2002.\n\n\nIn 2004, HP released the DV 1000 Series, including the HP Pavilion dv 1658 and 1040. In May 2006, HP began its campaign, \"The Computer is Personal Again\"; the campaign was designed to bring back the personal computer as a personal product. The campaign utilized viral marketing, sophisticated visuals, and its own website. Some of the ads featured Pharrell,[41] Petra Nemcova, Mark Burnett, Mark Cuban, Alicia Keys,[42] Jay-Z,[43] Gwen Stefani, and Shaun White.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn January 2005, following years of underperformance, which included HP's Compaq merger that fell short[44] and disappointing earning reports,[45] the board asked Fiorina to resign as chair and chief executive officer of the company, and she did on February 9, 2005.[46] After her departure, HP's stock jumped 6.9 percent.[47] Robert Wayman, chief financial officer of HP, served as interim CEO while the board undertook a formal search for a replacement.[48]\n\n\nMark Hurd of NCR Corporation was hired to take over as CEO and president, effective April 1, 2005. Hurd was the board's top choice given the revival of NCR that took place under his leadership.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2006\u20132009[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A sign marking the entrance to the HP corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 2006\n![](image)iPAQ 112 Pocket PC from 2008\nIn 2006, HP unveiled several new products including desktops, enhanced notebooks, a workstation, and software to manage them\u2014OpenView Client Configuration Manager 2.0.[49] In the same year, HP's share price skyrocketed due to consistent results in the last couple quarters of the year with Hurd's plan to cut back HP's workforce and lower costs.[50]\n\n\nIn July 2007, HP signed a definitive agreement to acquire Opsware in a cash tender deal that values the company at $14.25 per share, which combined Opsware software with the Oracle enterprise IT management software.[51]\n\n\nIn the first few years of Hurd's tenure as CEO, HP's stock price more than doubled. By the end of the 2007 fiscal year, HP reached the $100 billion mark for the first time. The company's annual revenue reached $104 billion, allowing HP to overtake competitor IBM.[52]\n\n\nOn May 13, 2008, HP and Electronic Data Systems (EDS) announced[53] that they had signed a definitive agreement under which HP would purchase EDS. On June 30, HP announced[54] that the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 had expired. \"The transaction still requires EDS stockholder approval and regulatory clearance from the European Commission and other non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the other closing conditions specified in the merger agreement.\" The agreement was finalized on August 26, 2008, at $13 billion, and it was publicly announced that EDS would be re-branded. The first targeted layoff of 24,600 former EDS workers was announced on September 15, 2008.[55] (The company's 2008 annual report gave the number as 24,700, to be completed by end of 2009.[56]) This round was factored into purchase price as a $19.5 billion liability against goodwill. As of September 23, 2009, EDS was known as HP Enterprise Services (now known as DXC Technology).\n\n\nOn November 11, 2009, 3Com and Hewlett-Packard announced that the latter would be acquiring 3Com for $2.7 billion in cash.[57] The acquisition was one of the biggest in size among a series of takeovers and acquisitions by technology giants to push their way to become one-stop shops. Since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007, tech giants have constantly felt the pressure to expand beyond their current market niches. Dell purchased Perot Systems recently to invade into the technology consulting business area previously dominated by IBM. Hewlett-Packard's latest move marked its incursion into enterprise networking gear market dominated by Cisco.\n\n\n\n### 2010\u20132012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Hewlett-Packard Mini 1000 netbook computer, a type of notebook computer\nOn April 28, 2010, Palm, Inc. and HP announced that the latter would buy the former for $1.2 billion in cash and debt.[58] Adding Palm handsets to the HP product line created some overlap with the iPAQ series of mobile devices, but was thought to significantly improve HP's mobile presence as iPAQ devices had not been selling well. Buying Palm, Inc. gave HP a library of valuable patents and the mobile operating platform, webOS. On July 1, 2010, the acquisition of Palm, Inc. was finalized.[59] Purchasing its webOS was a big gamble to build HP's own ecosystem.[60] On July 1, 2011, HP launched its first tablet, HP TouchPad, which brought webOS to tablet devices. On September 2, 2010, HP won the bidding war for 3PAR with a $33 a share offer ($2.07 billion) that Dell declined to match. After HP acquired Palm Inc., it phased out the Compaq brand.\n\n\nOn August 6, 2010, Hurd resigned amid controversy and CFO Cathie Lesjak assumed the role of interim CEO. Hurd had turned HP around and was widely regarded as one of Silicon Valley's star CEOs, and under his leadership, HP became the largest computer company in the world when measured by total revenue.[61] He was accused of sexual harassment against a colleague, though the allegations were deemed baseless. The investigation led to questions concerning some of his private expenses and the lack of disclosure related to the friendship.[62][63] Some observers have argued that Hurd was innocent, but the board asked for his resignation to avoid negative public relations.[64] Public analysis was divided between those who saw it as a commendable tough action by HP in handling expenses irregularities, and those who saw it as an ill-advised, hasty, and expensive reaction in ousting a remarkably capable leader who had turned the business around.[62][63][65] At HP, Hurd oversaw a series of acquisitions worth over $20 billion, which allowed the company to expand into services of networking equipment and smartphones.[66] HP shares dropped by 8.4% in after-hours trading, hitting a 52-week low with $9 billion in market capitalization shaved off.[67] Larry Ellison publicly attacked HP's board for Hurd's ousting, stating that the HP board had \"made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago\".[68]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2010, L\u00e9o Apotheker was named HP's new CEO and president.[69] His appointment sparked a strong reaction from Ellison,[70] who complained that Apotheker had been in charge of SAP when one of its subsidiaries was systematically stealing software from Oracle. SAP accepted that its subsidiary, which has now closed, illegally accessed Oracle intellectual property.[71] Following Hurd's departure, HP was seen to be problematic by the market, with margins falling and having failed to redirect and establish itself in major new markets such as cloud and mobile services.[*citation needed*] Apotheker's strategy was to broadly aim at disposing hardware and moving into the more profitable software services sector. On August 18, 2011, HP announced that it would strategically exit the smartphone and tablet computer business, and focus on higher-margin \"strategic priorities of Cloud, solutions and software with an emphasis on enterprise, commercial and government markets\".[72] It also contemplated selling off its personal computer division or spinning it off into a separate company,[73] and quitting PC development while continuing to sell servers and other equipment to business customers, which was a strategy undertaken by IBM in 2005.[74]\n\n\nHP's stock dropped by about a further 40% after the company abruptly announced a number of decisions: to discontinue its webOS device business (mobile phones and tablet computers), the intent to sell its personal computer division (at the time HP was the largest personal computer manufacturer in the world), and to acquire British big data software firm Autonomy for a 79% premium, seen externally as an \"absurdly high\" price[75] for a business with known concerns over its accounts.[76] Media analysts described HP's actions as a \"botched strategy shift\" and a \"chaotic\" attempt to rapidly reposition HP and enhance earnings.[75][77][78] The Autonomy acquisition was objected to by HP's own CFO.[79][80]:\u200a3\u20136\n\n\nHP lost more than $30 billion in market capitalization during Apotheker's tenure, and on September 22, 2011, the HP Board of Directors fired him as chief executive and replaced him with fellow board member and former eBay chief Meg Whitman,[81] with Raymond J. Lane as executive chairman. Although Apotheker served barely ten months, he received over $13 million in compensation.[82] Weeks later, HP announced that a review had concluded their PC division was too integrated and critical to business operations, and the company reaffirmed their commitment to the Personal Systems Group.[83] In November 2012, HP wrote off almost $9 billion related to the Autonomy acquisition, which became the subject of intense litigation, as HP accused Autonomy's previous management of fraudulently exaggerating Autonomy's financial position and called in law enforcement and regulators in both countries, while Autonomy's previous management accused HP of \"textbook\" obfuscation and finger pointing to protect HP's executives from criticism and conceal HP culpability, their prior knowledge of Autonomy's financial position, and gross mismanagement of Autonomy after acquisition.[80]:\u200a6\n\n\nOn March 21, 2012, HP said its printing and PC divisions would become one unit headed by Todd Bradley from the PC division, and printing chief Vyomesh Joshi left the company.[84]\n\n\nOn May 23, 2012, HP announced plans to lay off approximately 27,000 employees, after posting a profit decline of 31% in the second quarter of 2012.[85] Profits declined because of the growing popularity of smart phones, tablets, and other mobile devices, which slowed down personal computer sales.[86]\n\n\nOn May 30, 2012, HP unveiled its first net zero energy data center, which used solar energy and other renewable sources instead of traditional power grids.[87]\n\n\nOn July 10, 2012, HP's Server Monitoring Software was discovered to have a previously unknown security vulnerability.[88] A security warning was given to customers about two vulnerabilities, and a patch addressing the issues was released.[89] One month later, HP's official training center was hacked and defaced by a Pakistani hacker known as Hitcher to demonstrate a Web vulnerability.[90]\n\n\nOn September 10, 2012, HP revised their restructuring figures and started cutting 29,000 jobs.[91]\n\n\n\n### 2013\u20132015[edit]\n\n\nOn December 31, 2013, HP revised the number of jobs cut from 29,000 to 34,000 up to October 2014. The number of jobs cut until the end of 2013 was 24,600.[92][93][94] At the end of 2013 the company had 317,500 employees. On May 22, 2014, HP announced it would cut a further 11,000 to 16,000 jobs, in addition to the 34,000 announced in 2013. Whitman said: \"We are gradually shaping HP into a more nimble, lower-cost, more customer and partner-centric company that can successfully compete across a rapidly changing IT landscape.\"[95]\n\n\n During the June 2014 HP Discover customer event in Las Vegas, Whitman and Martin Fink announced a project for a radically new computer architecture called The Machine. Based on memristors and silicon photonics, it was supposed to come into commercialization before the end of the decade, and represented 75% of the research activity in HP Labs at the time.[96]\n\n\nOn October 6, 2014, HP announced it was going to split into two separate companies to separate its personal computer and printer businesses from its technology services. The split, which was first reported by *The Wall Street Journal* and confirmed by other media, resulted in two publicly traded companies on November 1, 2015: Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. The split was structured so that Hewlett-Packard changed its name to HP Inc. and spun off Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a new publicly traded company.[97][98] Whitman became chairman of HP Inc. and CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Patricia Russo became chairman of the enterprise business, and Dion Weisler became CEO of HP, Inc.[99][100][101]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2014, Hewlett-Packard announced their new Sprout personal computer.[102]\n\n\nIn May 2015, the company announced it would be selling its controlling 51 percent stake in its Chinese data-networking business to Tsinghua Unigroup for a fee of at least $2.4 billion.[103]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The research center of Hewlett-Packard in the Paris-Saclay cluster, France\nHP's global operations were directed from its headquarters in Palo Alto, California. Its US operations were directed from its facility in an unincorporated area of Harris County, Texas, near Houston. Its Latin America offices were in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, Florida. Its European offices were in Meyrin, close to Geneva, Switzerland,[104] but it also had a research center in the Paris-Saclay cluster 20\u00a0km south of Paris, France. Its Asia-Pacific offices were in Singapore.[105][106][107]\n\n\nIt also had large operations in Leixlip, Ireland;[108] Austin, Texas; Boise, Idaho; Corvallis, Oregon; Fort Collins, Colorado; Roseville, California; Saint Petersburg, Florida; San Diego, California; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Vancouver, Washington; Conway, Arkansas; and Plano, Texas. In the UK, HP was based at a large site in Bracknell, Berkshire, with offices in various UK locations, including a landmark office tower in London, 88 Wood Street. Its acquisition of 3Com expanded its employee base to Marlborough, Massachusetts, where it has been manufacturing its convertible laptop series since late 2019.[6] The company also had a large workforce and numerous offices in Bucharest, Romania, and at Bangalore, India, to address their back end and IT operations. Mphasis, which is headquartered at Bangalore, also enabled HP to increase their footprint in the city as it was a subsidiary of EDS which the company acquired.\n\n\n\n## Products and organizational structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)HP office in Japan\nHP produced lines of printers, scanners, digital cameras, calculators, personal digital assistants, servers, workstation computers, and computers for home and small-business use; many of the computers came from the 2002 merger with Compaq. HP as of 2001[update] promoted itself as supplying not just hardware and software, but also a full range of services to design, implement, and support IT infrastructure.\n\n\nHP's Imaging and Printing Group (IPG) was described by the company in 2005 as \"the leading imaging and printing systems provider in the world for printer hardware, printing supplies and scanning devices, providing solutions across customer segments from individual consumers to small and medium businesses to large enterprises\".[109]\n\n\n\nProducts and technology associated with IPG included the Inkjet and LaserJet printers, the Officejet all-in-one multifunction printer/scanner/faxes, Indigo Digital Press, the HP Photosmart digital cameras and photo printers, and the photo sharing service Snapfish.\n\n![](image)Hewlett-Packard 2014's desktop, monitor and laptop\n![](image)iPAQ h4150 Pocket PC from 2003\nOn December 23, 2008, HP released iPrint Photo for the iPhone.[110]\n\n\nHP's Personal Systems Group (PSG) was claimed by HP in 2005 to be \"one of the leading vendors of personal computers (\"PCs\") in the world based on unit volume shipped and annual revenue\".[109] PSG dealt with business and consumer PCs and accessories (such as e.g., HP Pavilion, Compaq Presario, and VoodooPC), handheld computing (e.g., iPAQ Pocket PC), digital \"connected\" entertainment (e.g., HP MediaSmart TVs, HP MediaSmart Servers, HP MediaVaults, DVD+RW drives) and Apple's iPod (until November 2005).[109]\n\n\nHP Enterprise Business (EB) incorporated HP Technology Services and Enterprise Services (an amalgamation of the former EDS, and what was known as HP Services). HP Enterprise Security Services oversaw professional services such as network security, information security and information assurance/compliancy, HP Software Division, and Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking Group (ESSN). The Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking Group (ESSN) oversaw \"back end\" products like storage and servers. HP Networking (former ProCurve) was responsible for the NW family of products.\n\n\n\n![](image)An HP camera with an SDIO interface, designed for use in conjunction with a Pocket PC\nHP Software Division was the company's enterprise software unit, which produced and marketed its brand of enterprise-management software, HP OpenView. From September 2005 HP purchased several software companies as part of a publicized, deliberate strategy to augment its software offerings for large business customers.[111] HP Software sold several categories of software, which included business service management software, application lifecycle management software, mobile apps, and enterprise security software (the latter of which included, ArcSight, Fortify Software, Atalla and TippingPoint). HP Software also provided software as a service (SaaS), cloud computing solutions, and software services, including consulting, education, professional services, and support.\n\n\nHP's Office of Strategy and Technology[112] had four main functions: To steer the company's $3.6\u00a0billion research and development investment; foster the development of the company's global technical community; lead the company's strategy and corporate development efforts,[113] and perform worldwide corporate marketing activities.\n\n\nHP Labs served as the research arm of HP.\n\n\nHP also offered managed services by which they provide complete IT-support solutions for other companies and organizations. One example of these was offering \"Professional Support\" and desktop \"Premier Support\" for Microsoft in the EMEA marketplace. This was done from the Leixlip campus near Dublin, Sofia and Israel. Support was offered for Microsoft Windows, Exchange, SharePoint, and some office applications.[114]\n\n\n\n## Staff and culture[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Hewlett-Packard executive leadership\n\n### Notable people[edit]\n\n\n* Michael Capellas (Compaq CEO/Chairman \u2013 HP President)[115]\n* Barney Oliver, founder and director of HP Labs\n* Steve Wozniak[116]\n* Tom Perkins\n* Carly Fiorina, 2016 Republican presidential candidate\n* Matt Shaheen, management consultant executive at HP Enterprise Services in Plano, Texas; Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives\n* Enrique Lores, CEO HP Inc.\n\n\n## Corporate social responsibility[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2007, the company announced that it had met its 2004 target to recycle one billion pounds of electronics, toner, and ink cartridges.[117] It set a new goal of recycling a further two billion pounds of hardware by the end of 2010. In 2006, the company recovered 187 million pounds of electronics.[118]\n\n\nIn 2008, HP released its supply chain emissions data.[119]\n\n\nIn September 2009, *Newsweek* ranked HP No. 1 on its 2009 Green Rankings of America's 500 largest corporations.[120] According to Environmental Leader (now Environment + Energy Leader), \"Hewlett-Packard earned its number one position due to its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction programs, and was the first major IT company to report GHG emissions associated with its supply chain, according to the ranking. In addition, HP has made an effort to remove toxic substances from its products, though Greenpeace has targeted the company for not doing better.\"[121]\n\n\nHP took the top spot on *Corporate Responsibility Magazine*'s 100 Best Corporate Citizens List for 2010.[122] HP beat out other Russell 1000 Index companies because of its leadership in seven categories including environment, climate changes and corporate philanthropy. In 2009, HP was ranked fifth.[123]\n\n\n*Fortune* magazine named HP one of the World's Most Admired Companies in 2010, placing it No. 2 in the computer industry and No. 32 overall in its list of the top 50. This year in the computer industry HP was ranked No. 1 in social responsibility, long-term investment, global competitiveness, and use of corporate assets.[124]\n\n\nIn May 2011, HP released a Global Responsibility report covering accomplishments in 2010.[125] It provides a comprehensive view of HP's global citizenship programs, performance, and goals and describes how HP used its technology, influence, and expertise to make a positive impact on the world. The company's 2009 report won best corporate responsibility report of the year,[126] and claims HP decreased its total energy use by 9 percent when compared with 2008. HP recovered a total of 118,000 tonnes of electronic products and supplies for recycling in 2009, including 61 million print cartridges.[127][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nIn an April 2010 *San Francisco Chronicle* article, HP was one of 12 companies commended for \"designing products to be safe from the start, following the principles of green chemistry\". The commendations came from Environment California, an environmental advocacy group, who praised select companies in the Golden State and the Bay Area for their conservational efforts.[128]\n\n\nIn May 2010, HP was named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute. It was one of 100 companies to earn the distinction of top winner and was the only computer hardware vendor to be recognized.[129]\n\n\nHP was listed in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks electronics manufacturers according to their policies on sustainability, energy and climate, and green products. In November 2011, HP secured first place (out of 15) in this ranking with a score of 5.9. It scored the most points on the new Sustainable Operations criteria, having the best program for measuring and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases from its suppliers and scoring maximum points for its thorough paper procurement policy.[130] In the November 2012 report, HP was ranked second with a score of 5.7.[131]\n\n\nHP earned recognition of its work in data privacy and security.[132] In 2010 the company ranked No. 4 in the Ponemon Institute's annual study of the most trusted companies for privacy.[133] Since 2006, HP has worked directly with the U.S. Congress, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Department of Commerce to establish a new strategy for federal legislation.[134] HP played a key role in work toward the December 2010 FTC report \"Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change\".[135]\n\n\nAfter winning nine straight annual \"Most Respected Company in China\" awards from the Economic Observer and Peking University, HP China added the \"10 Year Contribution\" award to its list of accolades.[136]\n\n\nIn its 2012 rankings of consumer electronics companies on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated HP second out of 24 companies.[137]\n\n\n\n## Brand[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Hewlett-Packard sponsored Porsche 997 GT3 Cup\n![](image)The company sponsored the HP Pavilion at San Jose (now SAP Center at San Jose), home to the NHL's San Jose Sharks.\nAccording to a 2009 BusinessWeek study, HP was the world's 11th most valuable brand.[138]\n\n\nHP had many sponsorships, such as Mission: SPACE in Epcot at the Walt Disney World Resort.[139] From 1995 to 1999, and again from 2013, HP had been the shirt sponsor of Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur F.C.[140] From 1997 to 1999 they sponsored Australian Football League club North Melbourne Football Club.[*citation needed*] They also sponsored the Jordan Grand Prix from 1999 to 2001, Stewart Grand Prix in 1999, Jaguar Racing from 2000 to 2002, BMW Williams Formula 1 team until 2005 (a sponsorship formerly held by Compaq), and since 2010 sponsored Renault F1.[141] HP also had the naming rights arrangement for the HP Pavilion at San Jose, whose naming rights were acquired by SAP AG and consequently renamed SAP Center at San Jose.[142] HP also maintained a number of corporate sponsorships in the business sector, including sponsorships of trade organisations including Fespa (print trade exhibitions), and O'Reilly Media's Velocity (web development) conference.\n\n\nAfter the acquisition of Compaq in 2002, HP maintained the Compaq Presario brand on low-end home desktops and laptops, the HP Compaq brand on business desktops and laptops, and the HP ProLiant brand on Intel-architecture servers. The HP Pavilion brand was used on home entertainment laptops and all home desktops.[143]\n\n\nTandem's \"NonStop\" servers were rebranded as \"HP Integrity NonStop\".[144]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nThis article is about the company that existed from 1939 to 2015. For information about controversies concerning the successor company, see HP Inc. \u00a7\u00a0Controversies.\n\n### Restatement[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2003, HP restated its first-quarter cash flow from operations, reducing it by 18 percent because of an accounting error. The actual cash flow from operations was $647 million, and not $791 million as reported; HP shifted $144 million to net cash used in investing activities.[145]\n\n\n\n### Spying scandal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hewlett-Packard spying scandal\n\nOn September 5, 2006, Shawn Cabalfin and David O'Neil of *Newsweek* wrote that HP's general counsel, at the behest of chairwoman Patricia Dunn, contracted a team of independent security experts to investigate board members and several journalists to identify the source of an information leak.[146] In turn, those security experts recruited private investigators who used pretexting,[147] which involved investigators impersonating HP board members and nine journalists (including reporters for CNET, *The New York Times* and *The Wall Street Journal*) in order to obtain their phone records. The information leaked related to HP's long-term strategy and was published as part of a CNET article[148] in January 2006. Most HP employees accused of criminal acts have since been acquitted.[149]\n\n\n\n### Hardware[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2007, HP released a BIOS update covering a wide range of laptops with the intent to speed up the computer fan and have it run constantly while the computer was on or off[150] to prevent the overheating of defective Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that had been shipped to many of the original equipment manufacturers, including HP, Dell, and Apple.[151] The defect concerned the new packaging material used by Nvidia from 2007 onwards in joining the graphics chip onto the motherboard, which did not perform well under thermal cycling and was prone to develop stress cracks \u2013 effectively severing the connection between the GPU and the motherboard that led to a blank screen.[152] In July 2008, HP issued an extension to the initial one-year warranty to replace the motherboards of selected models.[153] However this option was not extended to all models with the defective Nvidia chipsets, despite research showing that these computers were also affected by the fault.[154] Furthermore, the replacement of the motherboard was a temporary fix, since the fault was inherent in all units of the affected models from the point of manufacture, including the replacement motherboards offered by HP as a free \"repair\".[155][156] Since then, several websites have been documenting the issue.[157] There have been several small-claims lawsuits filed in several states, as well as suits filed in other countries. HP also faced a class-action lawsuit in 2009 over its i7 processor computers: the complainants stated that their systems consistently locked up within 30 minutes of powering on. Even after being replaced with newer i7 systems, the lockups continued.[158]\n\n\n\n### Lawsuit against Oracle[edit]\n\n\nHP filed a lawsuit in California Superior Court in Santa Clara, claiming that Oracle had breached an agreement to support the Itanium microprocessor used in HP's high-end enterprise servers.[159] On June 15, 2011, HP sent a \"formal legal demand\" letter to Oracle in an attempt to force them to reverse its decision to discontinue software development on Intel Itanium microprocessors[160] and build its own servers.[161] HP won the lawsuit in 2012, which required Oracle to continue producing software compatible with the Itanium processor.[162] HP was awarded $3 billion in damages against Oracle on June 30, 2016,[161][163] arguing that Oracle canceling support damaged HP's Itanium server brand. Oracle said it would appeal both the decision and damages.\n\n\n\n### HP wage and hour lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nSeveral class action firms filed a class action lawsuit on January 12, 2012, against HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (\u201cHP\u201d), entitled \"Jeffrey Wall, etc. v. HP, Inc.\" (formerly known as Hewlett-Packard Company, et al.), Case No. 30-2012-00537897, pending in the Superior Court of California, County of Orange. According to the lawsuit, HP allegedly failed to pay commission payments and incentive compensation that its California sales employees were owed within the timeframes proscribed by California law (Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 201, 202 and 204).[164] In 2017, FDAzar obtained a settlement of $25 million for class participants and changed the way HP pays incentive compensation and commission payments.[165]\n\n\n\n### Takeover of Autonomy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Autonomy Corporation \u00a7\u00a0Hewlett-Packard\n\nIn November 2012, HP recorded a write-down of around $8.8 billion related to its acquisition a year earlier of the UK-based Autonomy Corporation PLC. HP accused Autonomy of deliberately inflating the value of the company prior to its takeover, which the former management team of Autonomy denied.\n\n\nAt that time, HP had fired its previous CEO for expenses irregularities a year before, and appointed Apotheker as CEO and president. HP was seen as problematic by the market, with margins falling and having failed to redirect and establish itself in major new markets such as cloud and mobile services.\n\n\nAs part of Apotheker's strategy, Autonomy was acquired by HP in October 2011. HP paid $10.3 billion for 87.3% of the shares, valuing Autonomy at around $11.7 billion (\u00a37.4 billion) overall, a premium of around 79% over market price. The deal was widely criticized as \"absurdly high\", a \"botched strategy shift\" and a \"chaotic\" attempt to rapidly reposition HP and enhance earnings,[75][77][78] and had been objected to even by HP's own CFO.[79][80]:\u200a3\u20136 Within a year, Apotheker was fired, major culture clashes became apparent, and HP wrote off $8.8 billion of Autonomy's value.[79]\n\n\nHP claimed that this resulted from \"accounting improprieties, misrepresentations and disclosure failures\" by the previous management, who in turn accused HP of a \"textbook example of defensive stalling\"[80]:\u200a6 to conceal evidence of its own prior knowledge, gross mismanagement, and undermining of the company, noting public awareness since 2009 of its financial reporting issues[80]:\u200a3 and that even HP's CFO disagreed with the price paid.[79][80]:\u200a3\u20136 External observers generally stated that only a small part of the write-off appears to be due to accounting mis-statements, and that HP had previously overpaid for businesses.[79][166]\n\n\nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the SEC joined the FBI in investigating the potential anomalies. HP incurred damage with its stock falling to its lowest in decades.[167][168][169] Three lawsuits were brought by shareholders against HP for the fall in value of HP shares. In August 2014, a United States district court judge threw out a proposed settlement, which Autonomy's previous management had argued would be collusive and intended to divert scrutiny of HP's own responsibility and knowledge. It essentially engaged the plaintiff's attorneys from the existing cases and redirected them against the previous Autonomy vendors and management for a fee of up to $48 million, with plaintiffs agreeing to end any claims against HP's management and similarly redirect those claims against the previous Autonomy vendors and management.[170][171] In January 2015 the SFO closed its investigation as the likelihood of a successful prosecution was low.[172] The dispute continued in the US, and is being investigated by the UK and Ireland Financial Reporting Council. On June 9, 2015, HP agreed to pay $100 million to investors who bought HP shares between August 19, 2011 and November 20, 2012, to settle the lawsuits over the Autonomy purchase.[173]\n\n\nAnother term of the shareholder settlement was to sue Autonomy management, which occurred in London in 2019. HP \"failed to produce a smoking gun for the fraud it alleges\",[174] and its accountants admitted that they \"never formally prepared anything to attribute the irregularities to the amount of the fraud\".[174]\n\n\n\n### Israeli settlements[edit]\n\n\nOn October 25, 2012, Richard Falk, the United Nations Human Rights Council's Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, called to boycott HP and other businesses that profit from Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian lands until they brought their operations in line with international human rights and humanitarian law.[175][176] In 2014, the Presbyterian Church voted to move forward with divestment from HP to pressure Israel in regards to their policies toward Palestinians.[177] In 2015, the Human Rights Commission of Portland, Oregon, requested to place Caterpillar, G4S, HP, and Motorola Solutions on the city's \"Do Not Buy\" list.[178]\n\n\n\n### Bribery[edit]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2014, an administrative proceeding before the SEC was settled by HP consenting to an order acknowledging that HP had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when HP subsidiaries in Russia, Poland, and Mexico made improper payments to government officials to obtain or retain lucrative public contracts.[179]\n\n\nThe SEC's order found that HP's subsidiary in Russia paid more than $2 million through agents and various shell companies to a Russian government official to retain a multimillion-dollar contract with the federal prosecutor's office; in Poland, HP's subsidiary provided gifts and cash bribes worth more than $600,000 to a Polish government official to obtain contracts with the national police agency; and to win a software sale to Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, HP's subsidiary in Mexico paid more than $1 million in inflated commissions to a consultant with close ties to company officials, one of whom was funneled money. HP agreed to pay $108 million to settle the SEC charges and a parallel criminal case.[180][179][181]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* ArcSight\n* Fortify\n* HP calculators\n* HP Linux Imaging and Printing\n* HP Software & Solutions\n* HP User Group\n* List of acquisitions by Hewlett-Packard\n* List of computer system manufacturers\n* List of Hewlett-Packard products\n* TippingPoint\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"History and Facts: The beginning\". *www.hpmemoryproject.org*.

He is the founder, chairman, and CEO of Dell Technologies, one of the world's largest technology infrastructure companies.[1] He is the 18th richest person in the world according to the *Bloomberg Billionaires Index*, with a net worth of $65 billion as of November 2023.[2]\n\n\nIn 2011, his 243.35 million shares of Dell stock were worth $3.5 billion, giving him 12% ownership of the company.[3] His remaining wealth of roughly $10 billion is invested in other companies and is managed by DFO Management, which incorporates his initials.[4] In January 2013 it was announced that he had bid to take Dell Inc. private for $24.4 billion in the biggest management buyout since the Great Recession. Dell Inc. officially went private in October 2013.[5] The company once again went public in December 2018.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nDell was born in 1965 in Houston to a Jewish family. His parents were Lorraine Charlotte (n\u00e9e Langfan), a stockbroker,[7] and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist. Michael attended Herod Elementary School in Houston.[8] He would go on to attend Memorial High School.[9] In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight.[10] In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.[11]\n\n\nDell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.[12] Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the *Houston Post* in the summer.[13] Dell's parents wanted him to be a doctor and in order to please them, he took up pre-med at the University of Texas in 1983.[14] Dell continued learning to target specific populations for newspaper subscriptions rather than just making cold calls.[15] He discovered that people who were most likely to get a subscription were newlyweds and people moving to a new home. After collecting the contact information of this population from public records, he sent direct mail appeals and earned $18,000 in one year.[13] He hired several employees, and after earning a gross profit of nearly $200,000 in his first year of business, Dell dropped out of the University of Texas at age 19.[16]\n\n\n\n## Business career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A PC's Limited Turbo PC signed by Dell\n![](image)Michael Dell lecturing at the Oracle OpenWorld, San Francisco 2010\nWhile a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building.[9][17] He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.[18][19][20]\n\n\nIn January 1984, Dell believed that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel.[21] In January 1984, Dell registered his company as \"PC's Limited\". Dell\u2019s strategy was to sell directly to customers by manufacturing computers only after they were ordered.[22] Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 worth of PC upgrades, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as \"Dell Computer Corporation\" and relocated to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few people as order takers, a few more to fill the orders, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff consisting of \"three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables\". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.[23][24]\n\n\nIn 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in *Fortune* magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.[25] In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon[*when?*] reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.[26] In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, surpassing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitors' sales were shrinking.[27]\n\n\nIn 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[28] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[29]\n\n\nIn 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the company.[30]\n\n\nOn October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the \"highest-valued tech acquisition in history\".[31][32] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[33]\n\n\n\n## Penalty[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges[34] of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each and former CFO James Schneider agreed to pay $3 million to settle the charges.[34]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nAccolades for Dell include \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" (at age 24) from *Inc.* magazine;[35] \"Top CEO in American Business\" from *Worth* magazine; \"CEO of the Year\" from *Financial World*, *IndustryWeek* and *Chief Executive* magazines. Dell also received the 1998 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement[36] and the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[37]\n\n\n\n## Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nDell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[38]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Governor Greg Abbott named Dell to the Strike Force to Open Texas \u2013 a group \"tasked with finding safe and effective ways to slowly reopen the state\" during the COVID-19 pandemic.[39] He also serves as an advisor on the COVID-19 Technology Task Force, a technology industry coalition founded in March 2020 collaborating on solutions to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.[40]\n\n\n\n## Writings[edit]\n\n\nDell's 1999 book, *Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry* (by HarperBusiness), is an account of his early life, his company's founding, growth and missteps, as well as lessons learned. The book was written in collaboration with Catherine Fredman.[41]\n\n\nDell's second book, *Play Nice But Win: A CEO's Journey from Founder to Leader* (by Portfolio), is a story of inside battles that defined him as a leader. The book was written in collaboration with James Kaplan.[42]\n\n\n\n## Wealth[edit]\n\n\n*Forbes* estimated Dell's net worth at $71.5 billion as of October 2023.[43]\n\n\nIn February 2018, it was reported that in 2014, Dell had paid $100.5 million for Manhattan's One57 penthouse, which was then a record for the most expensive home ever sold in the city.[44]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDell married Susan Lieberman on October 28, 1989, in Austin, Texas; the couple reside there with their four children.[45][46][47]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn 1999, Michael and Susan Dell established the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. In 2006, the foundation provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to complement the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.[48] In 2013, the foundation provided an additional $50 million commitment to establish the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.[49] Since 1999, the MSDF has committed $1.23 billion to non-profits and social enterprises in the United States, India and South Africa.[50] Dell is also behind the founding of the Dell Jewish Community Campus in the Northwest Hills neighborhood of Austin.[51]\n\n\nBy 2011, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa.[52] Today the foundation has over $466 million in assets under management.[53]\n\n\nIn 2002, Dell received an honorary doctorate in Economic Science from the University of Limerick in honor of his investment in Ireland and the local community and for his support for educational initiatives.[54]\n\n\nIn 2012, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation committed $50 million for medical education. The Dell Medical School began enrolling students in 2016.[55]\n\n\nIn 2014, he donated $1.8 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.[56]\n\n\nIn 2017, in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Dell, a Houston native, pledged $36 million to relief efforts.[57]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Dell donated $1 billion to his foundation, which focuses on child poverty; it makes both impact investments and charitable donations.[58]\n\n\nIn 2018, Dell Technologies returned to public markets through a complicated financial restructuring.[59]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation donated $100 million to support small businesses and others endure the COVID-19 pandemic and help finding treatments for coronavirus.[60]\n\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation donated $38 million to three non-profit organizations that are devoted to housing homeless people in Austin.[61]\n\n\nIn 2023, it was noted that the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation has donated over $2.43 billion so far.[62]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Surrounding oneself with the best talent\". *Industr*.

In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the \"Think different\" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately began a review of the company's products. Jobs would order 70% of the company's products to be cancelled, resulting in the loss of 3,000 jobs, and taking Apple back to the core of its computer offerings.[77] The next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150\u00a0million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing software for the Mac.[78] The investment was seen as an \"antitrust insurance policy\" for Microsoft who had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices.[79] Jobs also ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, Power Computing.[80] On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the Apple Store website, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing that had been successfully used by PC manufacturer Dell.[81]\n\n\nThe moves paid off for Jobs; at the end of his first year as CEO, the company turned a $309 million profit.[77]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n198. **^** \"Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion\".

Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80.[106] When Apple surpassed Dell's market cap in January 2006,[107] Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dell's CEO Michael Dell should eat his words.[108] Nine years prior, Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would \"shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders\".[109]\n\n\n\n### 2007\u20132011: Success with mobile devices[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith Spindler at the helm, Apple, IBM, and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in 1994 with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform; PReP), which used IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows. That year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh, the first of many computers with Motorola's PowerPC processor.[69]\n\n\nIn the wake of the alliance, Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones. Over the next two years, 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced. However, by 1996, Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of their own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest.[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n219. **^** Webb, Alex (May 19, 2016). \"Inside the New Apple Retail Store Design\".

Jobs thought the name \"Apple\" was \"fun, spirited and not intimidating\".[195] Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were fans of the Beatles,[196] but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with Apple Corps Ltd., a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1968. This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies.

The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called \"1984\".

The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.\n\n\n\nThe success of the lower-cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue.[59] For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process.

Its products include desktop computers, laptops, netbooks, mobile phones, networking equipment, monitors, wi-fi routers, projectors, motherboards, graphics cards, optical storage, multimedia products, peripherals, wearables, servers, workstations and tablet PCs. The company is also an original equipment manufacturer (OEM).\n\n\nAsus is the world's 5th-largest PC vendor by unit sales as of January 2023.[8] Asus appears in *BusinessWeek*'s \"InfoTech 100\" and \"Asia's Top 10 IT Companies\" rankings, and it ranked first in the IT Hardware category of the 2008 Taiwan Top 10 Global Brands survey with a total brand value of US$1.3 billion.[9]\n\n\nAsus has a primary listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the ticker code *2357* and formerly had a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker code *ASKD*.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe company is usually referred to as *ASUS* or *Hu\u00e1shu\u00f2* in Chinese (traditional Chinese: \u83ef\u78a9; simplified Chinese: \u534e\u7855, literally \"Eminence by the Chinese\"[10]). According to the company website, the name *ASUS* originates from Pegasus, the winged horse of Greek mythology.[11] Only the last four letters of the word were used to give the name a high position in alphabetical listings.[12]\nAs its marketing taglines, ASUS has used *Rock Solid. Heart Touching* (2003\u20132009) and subsequently *Inspiring Innovation Persistent Perfection* (2009\u20132013). Since 2013, the company's tagline has been *In Search of Incredible.*[13]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAsus was founded in Taipei in 1989[14] by T.H. Tung, Ted Hsu, Wayne Hsieh and M.T. Liao,[15] all four having previously worked at Acer as hardware engineers. At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the computer hardware business. Intel Corporation would supply any new processors to more established companies like IBM first, and Taiwanese companies would have to wait for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering prototypes. According to company history, Asus created a motherboard prototype for using an Intel 486, but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself had a problem with its own 486 motherboard. Asus solved Intel's problem and it turned out that Asus' motherboard worked correctly without the need for further modification. Since then, Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its competitors.[16][17]\n\n\nIn September 2005, Asus released the first PhysX accelerator card.[18] In December 2005, Asus entered the LCD TV market with the TLW32001 model.[19] In January 2006, Asus announced that it would cooperate with Lamborghini to develop the VX laptop series.[20]\n\n\nOn 9 March 2006, Asus was confirmed as one of the manufacturers of the first Microsoft Origami models, together with Samsung and Founder Technology.[21] On 8 August 2006, Asus announced a joint venture with Gigabyte Technology.[22] On 5 June 2007, Asus announced the launch of the Eee PC at COMPUTEX Taipei. On 9 September 2007, Asus indicated support for Blu-ray, announcing the release of a BD-ROM/DVD writer PC drive, BC-1205PT.[23] ASUS subsequently released several Blu-ray based notebooks.\n\n\nIn January 2008, Asus began a major restructuring of its operations, splitting into three independent companies: Asus (focused on applied first-party branded computers and electronics); Pegatron (focused on OEM manufacturing of motherboards and components); and Unihan Corporation (focused on non-PC manufacturing such as cases and molding).[24][25] In the process of the restructuring, a highly criticized pension-plan restructuring effectively zeroed out the existing pension balances. The company paid out all contributions previously made by employees.[26]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2008, the Open Handset Alliance announced that Asus had become one of 14 new members of the organization. These \"new members will either deploy compatible Android devices, contribute significant code to the Android Open-Source Project, or support the ecosystem through products and services that will accelerate the availability of Android-based devices.\"[27]\n\n\nOn 1 June 2010, Asus spun off Pegatron Corp.[28]\n\n\nIn October 2010, Asus and Garmin announced that they would be ending their smartphone partnership as a result of Garmin deciding to exit the product category.[29] The two companies had produced six Garmin-ASUS branded smartphones over the prior two years.[29]\n\n\nIn December 2010, Asus launched the world's thinnest notebook, the Asus U36, with Intel processor voltage standard (not low voltage) Intel Core i3 or i5 with a thickness of only 19\u00a0mm.[30]\n\n\nIn January 2013, Asus officially ended production of its Eee PC series due to declining sales caused by consumers increasingly switching to tablets and Ultrabooks.[31][32] In April 2022, the company unveiled its new logo.[33][34]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Asus US headquarters in Fremont, California\n![](image)An Asus shop in Hong Kong\nAsus has its headquarters in Beitou District, Taipei, Taiwan.[35]\n\n\nAs of 2009[update], Asus had manufacturing facilities in Taiwan (Taipei, Luzhu, Nangang, Guishan), mainland China (Suzhou, Chongqing), Mexico (Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) and the Czech Republic (Ostrava).

The Ally possesses a 7-inch (diagonal), 1080p touchscreen display with a 120\u00a0Hz refresh rate capability and a 16:9 aspect ratio, versus the Steam Deck's panel that only manages 800p and 60\u00a0Hz with a 16:10 aspect ratio.[56]\n\n\n\n### The Ultimate Force (TUF)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ASUS TUF Gaming X3\n**The Ultimate Force** (**TUF**) is a brand used by ASUS since about 2010.[57] The brand is for ASUS affordable, mid-range gaming products.\n\n\n\n### Sound cards[edit]\n\n\nAsus released its first sound card, the Xonar DX, in February 2008. The Xonar DX was able to emulate the EAX 5.0 effects through the ASUS GX software while also supporting Open AL and DTS-connect.[58] In July 2008 ASUS launched the Xonar D1, which offered largely similar features to the Xonar DX but connected to the motherboard through the PCI interface instead of the PCI-E \u00d71 connection of the Xonar DX.[59] ASUS then released the Xonar HDAV 1.3, which was the first solution enabling loss-less HD audio bit streaming to AV receivers.[60]\n\n\nIn May 2009, Asus launched the Essence ST sound card, targeted at high-end audiophiles, and featuring 124\u00a0dB SNR rating and precision audio clock tuning.[61] In the same month, Asus refreshed the HDAV family by releasing the HDAV 1.3 slim, a card targeted for HTPC users offering similar functionality to HDAV 1.3 but in a smaller form.[62] During Computex 2010, ASUS introduced its Xonar Xense, an audio bundle composed of the Xense sound card and a special edition of the Sennheiser PC350 headset.[63][64] In August 2010, ASUS released the Xonar DG sound card targeted at budget buyers and offering 5.1 surround sound support, 105\u00a0dB SNR rating, support for Dolby headphone and GX 2.5 support for emulating EAX 5.0 technology.[65][66]\n\n\n\n### ASUS VivoPC line[edit]\n\n\nAsus entered the box-PC market with the Vivo PC line in November 2013.[67] ASUS VivoPCs come without a pre-installed Windows operating system.\n\n\nOn 23 October 2013, ASUS launched two models of VivoPCs in India.[68] VivoPC was initially announced with Intel Celeron processor equipped VM40B model. But in India, the company released VivoPC along with a new model called VC60 which is equipped with Intel Core series processors.[69]\n\n\n\n### Portable monitors[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Asus released the MB168B, a USB 3.0-powered, portable external monitor. The base model shipped with a resolution of 1366\u2009\u00d7\u2009768, while the MB168B+ had a resolution of 1920\u2009\u00d7\u20091080.[70] At the time of its release, the MB168B+ was the only 1080p portable monitor. According to Asus, it is the \"world's slimmest and lightest USB monitor\".[70]\n\n\n\n### Desktop monitors[edit]\n\n\n* ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDM\n* ROG Swift OLED PG42UQ\n* ROG Swift OLED PG48UQ\n* ROG Swift PG279QM (2560x1440, 240Hz, IPS)\n* ROG Swift PG27AQN (2560x1440, 360Hz, IPS)\n* ROG Swift PG279Q[71]\n* ROG Swift PG348Q\n* ROG Swift PG35VQ[72]\n* ROG Swift PB27UQ\n* ROG Strix XG27AQ\n* ROG Strix XG27AQM\n* ROG Strix XG27AQMR\n* ROG Strix XG27AQV\n* MX34VQ\n* VZ279Q\n\n\n### Motherboards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Q-Connector\nAsus motherboards sometimes include a **Q-Connector** which sits in between the motherboard front panel connectors and the front panel cables. The Q-Connector is marked with bigger text than the front panel connectors on the motherboard, as well as protruding from the motherboard, limiting obstruction from heatsinks and other connectors.[73][74]\n\n\nThe Q-connector allows the many front-panel connections to be removed as a single unit for maintenance. This greatly reduces the risk of incorrect connections when reassembling.[75]\n\n\n\n## Other initiatives[edit]\n\n\n### Esports[edit]\n\n\nAsus ROG has been an active advocate for esports, having established some of their very own professional gaming teams.[76]\n\n\nIn January 2021, ROG announced the establishment of a new esports academy in India, with plans to scout and train professional gamers for the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) PC game.[77] The initiative will provide shortlisted gamers with coaching, gaming equipment, and stipends to prepare them for competitive esports tournaments on both the national and international levels.[78]\n\n\n\n## Environmental record[edit]\n\n\n### Green ASUS[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Asus launched Green ASUS,[79] a company-wide sustainable computing initiative overseen by a steering committee led by Jonney Shih, the Chairman of Asus. According to the company, Asus pursues green policies in \"Design, Procurement, Manufacturing, and Marketing.\"[80]\n\n\n\n### Recognition[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Asus obtained IECQ (IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components) and HSPM (Hazardous Substance Process Management) certification for its headquarters and all of its manufacturing sites.[81]\n\n\nIn 2007, Oekom Research, an independent research institute specializing in corporate responsibility assessment, recognized Asus as a \"highly environmental friendly company\" in the \"Computers, Peripherals and Office Electronics Industry\".[82]\n\n\nIn October 2008, Asus received 11 Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) Gold Awards for its products,[83] including four of its N-Series notebooks, namely the N10, N20, N50, and N80. In the following month, it received EU Flower certification for the same N-Series notebooks at an award ceremony held in Prague.[82] In December 2008, Det Norske Veritas conferred the world's first EuP (Energy-using Product) certification for portable notebooks on these machines.[82]\n\n\n\n### Recycling campaign[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2008, Asus launched its \"PC Recycling for a Brighter Future\"[84][85]\nprogram in collaboration with Intel and with Tsann Kuen Enterprise Co. The program collected more than 1,200 desktop computers, notebooks and CRT/LCD monitors, refurbished them and donated them to 122 elementary and junior high schools, five aboriginal communities and the Tzu Chi Stem Cell Center.\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2008, *PC Pro* discovered through a reader that Asus had accidentally shipped laptops that contained cracked and unlicensed software.[86] Both physical machines and recovery CDs contained confidential documents from Microsoft and other organizations, internal Asus documents, and sensitive personal information including CVs. At the time, an Asus spokesperson promised an investigation at \"quite a high level\", but declined to comment on how the files got on the machines and recovery media.[87] It was demonstrated that an unattended installation of Windows Vista could accidentally copy material from a flash drive with a parameter in the \"unattend.xml\" file on the personal flash drive being used to script the installation.[88][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nIn February 2014, a security vulnerability in the AiCloud functions on a number of Asus routers was compromised to distribute a text file warning of a vulnerability, disclosed in June 2013, allowing the ability to \"traverse to any external storage plugged in through the USB ports on the back of the router\" via the open internet. Before making the vulnerability public, the researcher was told by Asus that the behavior was \"not an issue\", but the vulnerability was reportedly patched shortly before the breach.[89] The IP addresses of 12,937 routers, and 3,131 AiCloud accounts were also leaked by the hackers.[90] The U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint about the breach for the company's \"failure to employ reasonable security practices has subjected consumers to substantial injury\", alleging that Asus had also failed to perform basic penetration tests, allowed users to maintain a default admin password for the AiDisk feature and failed to notify users of security updates in a timely fashion. As a result, it was also deemed that Asus had misled consumers over the security and protection that its routers provided. In February 2016, Asus settled the complaint, agreeing to implement a \"comprehensive security program\", including independent audits every two years for the next 20 years.[91][90]\n\n\n\nIn March 2019, Kaspersky Lab researchers disclosed a supply chain attack that affected the Asus Live Update software bundled on its laptops, dubbed **ShadowHammer**. Kaspersky stated that between June and November 2018, Asus servers had been compromised to distribute a modified version of Live Update, signed with an Asus signature, that contained a backdoor. It deployed a further payload if the device's network adapter matched an entry on an internal target list of around 600 MAC addresses. In response to ShadowHammer, Asus released a patched version of Live Update with improved security measures. Kaspersky and Symantec estimated that between 500,000 and 1 million devices were infected with the backdoor, although Asus attempted to downplay the severity of the breach by noting the extremely targeted nature of the attack. The breach did not affect the similar, identically named software associated with its motherboards.[92][93][94]\n\n\n\nIn April 2019, ESET disclosed that a group known as BlackTech had performed targeted attacks with malware known as Plead, distributed via the updater for the Asus WebStorage service. ESET stated that the group was likely using a man-in-the-middle attack via a vulnerability in routers, in combination with the updater using an unencrypted HTTP connection.[95]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Asus recalled some of its Z690 Maximus Hero motherboards due to a manufacturing flaw, where a RAM capacitor was installed backward\u2014causing them to burn out associated MOSFETs and prevent the motherboard from detecting memory.[96]\n\n\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, ASUS initially refused to join a widespread withdrawal of businesses from the Russian market. In mid-March, the company did announce it was halting its operations in Russia, following a social media boycott and government pressure.[97][98]\n\n\nIn April 2023, a post on the PCMasterRace subreddit began gaining popularity regarding the user's AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, which had visible burning, along with the socket of the Asus motherboard.[99] This sparked the attention of both people interested in PCs, who initially thought it was an issue with the 3D V-Cache Technology (as there had been previous user reports similar to this incident),[99] as well as enthusiast YouTube channels such as Gamers Nexus, who ran tests to successfully recreate the burning of their CPU.[100] They realised that the cause of the burning was due to a voltage error in the BIOS. In May, Asus responded to the incidents by releasing a Beta BIOS, which was supposed to fix the error. However, not only did the new BIOS not fix the issue; by installing it, the user voided their warranty as it was a Beta BIOS, which Asus clearly stated in the BIOS's description.[100][101][102] Later that month, Asus responded to the public backlash by reversing course, releasing a statement informing users that they will continue to honor warranty on motherboards that have been updated to beta BIOS versions, as well as extend motherboard warranty coverage to uses of AMD EXPO, Intel XMP, and DOCP memory overclocking technologies.[103][104]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Taiwan portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* ASRock\n* Biostar\n* DFI\n* Elitegroup Computer Systems\n* EVGA Corporation\n* Fastra II\n* Gigabyte Technology\n* Micro-Star International\n* List of companies of Taiwan\n* List of wireless router firmware projects\n* Tomato (firmware)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"ASUSTek Computer Inc.
