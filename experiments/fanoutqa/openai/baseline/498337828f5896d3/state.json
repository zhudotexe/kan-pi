The series, which aired from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014, follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother. *How I Met Your Mother* was a joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television, and syndicated by 20th Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television).\n\n\nThe series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New York.[1] The vast majority of the episodes (196 out of 208) were directed by Pamela Fryman. The other directors were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).\n\n\nKnown for its unique structure, humor, and incorporation of dramatic elements, *How I Met Your Mother* was popular throughout its run. It received positive reviews initially, but reception became more mixed as the seasons went on.[2][3][4] The show was nominated for 91 awards and received 21. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor twice.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) and his love life as a single man. His stories are narrated by Bob Saget as Ted Mosby 25 years later as he tells them to his children.\n\n\nThe story goes into a flashback and starts in 2005 with Ted Mosby living in New York City and working as an architect. The narrative deals primarily with his best friends. These include the long-lasting couple Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes, as well as womanizing playboy Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), and Canadian news reporter Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders). All of the characters' lives are entwined. The series explores many storylines, including a \"will they or won't they\" relationship between Robin and each of the two single male friends, Marshall and Lily's relationship, and the ups and downs of the characters' careers.\n\n\nThe show's frame story depicts Ted (voice of Bob Saget, uncredited) verbally retelling the story to his son Luke (David Henrie) and daughter Penny (Lyndsy Fonseca) as they sit on the couch in the year 2030. This future-set frame is officially the show's \"present day\", and *How I Met Your Mother* exploits this framing device in numerous ways: to depict and re-depict events from multiple points of view; to set up jokes using quick and sometimes multiple flashbacks nested within the oral retelling; to substitute visual, verbal, or aural euphemisms for activities Ted does not want to talk about with his children (sexual practices, use of illicit substances, vulgar language, etc.).\n\n\nWhile the traditional love story structure begins when the romantic leads first encounter each other, *How I Met Your Mother* does not introduce Ted's wife (Cristin Milioti) until the eighth-season finale and only announces her full name, Tracy McConnell, during the series finale. Her first name, Tracy, is mentioned in the first season, at the end of episode nine.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n*How I Met Your Mother* was inspired by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas' idea to \"write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York\", where they previously worked as writers for *Late Show with David Letterman*, among others.[1] The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.[5][6] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work and was available.[5] Josh Radnor and Jason Segel, who were cast as Ted and Marshall, respectively, were not well known, although Segel had been a cast member on the short-lived *Freaks and Geeks* and a recurring guest star on Judd Apatow's follow-up show, *Undeclared*. The role of Barney was initially envisioned as a \"John Belushi-type character\"[7] before Neil Patrick Harris won the role after being invited to an audition by the show's casting director Megan Branman.[8] Pamela Fryman invited Bob Saget to be the voiceover narrator, Future Ted, explaining to him that the show would be like *The Wonder Years* but \"kind of into the future\".[9] Saget either went to the television studio and recorded the narration while watching the episode, or did so separately and rerecorded with the episode if necessary.[10] He normally did not attend table readings but did so for the last episode.[11]\n\n\nIn multiple interviews Bays and Thomas have stated that \"a pretty famous actress\"[12] turned down the role of Robin, who they revealed in February 2014 was Jennifer Love Hewitt.[13] They then cast the unknown Cobie Smulders; Bays and Thomas later said, \"Thank God we did for a million reasons... when Ted's seeing her for the first time, America's seeing her for the first time\u2014the intrigue of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive\".[12] Although Ted is initially smitten by Robin in the pilot, it is quickly established at the end of the episode that she is not the mother, which Thomas said was done so they would not repeat the \"will they or won't they\" Ross and Rachel storyline from *Friends*.[6]\n\n\nAccording to an *Entertainment Weekly* article, the writers adopted facets of each main actor's personality and incorporated them into their characters. This includes Neil Patrick Harris' skills with magic, Jason Segel's passion for songwriting, Alyson Hannigan's absent-mindedness while pregnant, and Josh Radnor's intellectualism.[14]\n\n\nMacLaren's, an Irish bar in the middle of New York City, in which a lot of the show is set, is loosely based on four favorite bars of Bays, Thomas, and others' from the *Late Show* staff. Others include: McGee's, a Midtown tavern near the Ed Sullivan Theater where the *Late Show* is taped; McHale's, a legendary Hell's Kitchen bar which closed in 2006; Chumley's, a since-closed historic Greenwich Village pub; and Fez, another closed bar on the Upper West Side.[15] McGee's had a mural that Bays and Thomas both liked and wanted to incorporate into the show.[16] The name for the bar is from Carter Bays' assistant, Carl MacLaren; the bartender in the show is also named Carl.[17]\n\n\nEpisodes were generally shot over a three-day period in the Los Angeles-based Soundstage Studio 22[18] and featured upwards of 50 scenes with quick transitions and flashbacks. However, the \"Pilot\" episode was filmed at CBS Radford.[19] The laugh track was later created by recording an audience being shown the final edited episode. Thomas claimed that shooting before a live audience would have been impossible because of the structure of the show and the numerous flashforwards in each episode and because doing so \"would blur the line between 'audience' and 'hostage situation'\".[20] Later seasons started filming in front of an audience on occasion, when smaller sets were used.\n\n\nThe theme song is a portion of \"Hey Beautiful\" by The Solids, of which Bays and Thomas are members. Episodes from season 1 generally started with the opening credits. A cold opening has been used since season 2. Viewers then occasionally see Ted's children on a couch and hear him talking to them, telling the story of how he met their mother. Alternatively, scenes from previous episodes or shots of New York City with Ted narrating over the top are shown. Thomas has stated that Future Ted is an unreliable narrator, since he is trying to tell a story that happened over 20 years earlier;[21] this has been a plot point in several episodes including \"The Goat\", \"Oh Honey\", \"How I Met Everyone Else\", and \"The Mermaid Theory\". Nevertheless, Thomas has also emphasized maintaining a coherent and consistent universe and trying to avoid continuity errors, a problem he noticed in other shows.[22]\n\n\nA scene relating to the identity of the mother, involving Ted's future children, was filmed in 2006 for the show's eventual series finale.[23] This was done because the teenage actors portraying them would be adults by the time the final season was shot.[21]\n\n\nDuring the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike, *How I Met Your Mother* shut down production; when the strike ended, the show returned on March 17, 2008, with nine new episodes.[24] The network announced a change in the timeslot to 8:30 pm ET/7:30 pm CT, flip-flopping from the summer schedule with *The Big Bang Theory*.[25] CBS renewed the show for a fourth season on May 14, 2008,[26] which premiered on September 22, 2008.[27]\n\n\nIn September 2008, Lifetime Television announced it had purchased the cable rerun rights to *How I Met Your Mother* at a rate of about $725,000 per episode.[28] The four-year syndication contract stipulated that the studio deliver at least 110 half-hour episodes by 2010 and allowed for up to eight seasons of the show. At the end of the fourth season only 88 episodes had been produced, and a further 22 episodes were required, ensuring that there would be a fifth season.[29] There also was a complication with the writing of the show because of actress Alyson Hannigan's absence due to her pregnancy; in response, the writers had to create episodes that did not include one of the five main characters.[30] On May 19, 2009, the fifth-season renewal was announced.[31] May 20, 2009, CBS announced that *How I Met Your Mother* would again be aired at 8 pm, leading into the new comedy *Accidentally on Purpose*. On January 12, 2010, the show aired its 100th episode, and CBS announced that the series would return for a sixth season.[32]\nUpon learning that the series would be syndicated, Thomas said, \"We're thrilled that it will live on in other forms,\" and they were proud of the show and it was great to see the strong demand.[33]\n\n\nReruns of the series began airing on local U.S. broadcast television stations and on Chicago-based cable superstation WGN America on September 14, 2010. Featured in these airings are vanity cards previously unseen in the CBS and Lifetime airings due to marginalized credit sequences used by the two networks. Shown in between the closing credits and the production company credits, these vanity cards show portions of \"The Bro Code\", a list of rules frequently referenced by Harris' character, Barney Stinson, on how men should interact with each other, with an emphasis on activities involving pursuing members of the opposite sex. The opening theme song for the syndicated reruns is also slightly edited, running shorter and not using all the pictures seen in the opening montage that runs on DVD and the original CBS broadcasts. The episodes are also slightly shorter, to allow for more commercials during a timeslot in syndication.\n\n\nOne of the series' traditions involved giving guest roles to actors from various Joss Whedon productions, many of whom co-starred with Hannigan on *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. Bays attributed this to their being \"huge fans\" and to those casts representing \"a big talent pool\".[34]\n\n\nOn March 4, 2011, CBS announced that the show had been renewed for two more seasons,[35] with the seventh season premiering with back-to-back episodes on September 19, 2011.[36]\n\n\nOn July 27, 2011, the FX channel announced it had picked up the series for syndication. On September 5, 2011, FX began airing the series.[37]\n\n\nCast members had said the show would not run longer than eight seasons,[38] but a ninth season was secured in December 2012 amid tense negotiations with the studios and the actors\u2014especially Segel, who had wanted to move on to other ventures after the eighth season.[39][40] During these negotiations, Bays and Thomas originally approached the eighth season as if it were the show's last, but had a \"Plan B\" in case the show were renewed.[41] After producers secured a ninth season, they implemented plans to secretly cast the titular future mother, with Cristin Milioti eventually winning the role, having bested at least two other contenders.[12] Milioti first appeared in the last scene in the season eight finale \"Something New\" and was a regular cast member in the show's final season.[42] This was the first time the show had expanded its core roster.[42][43]\n\n\nIn January 2013, *How I Met Your Mother* was renewed for a ninth season.[44] Carter Bays told *Entertainment Weekly* that season 9 would \"feature some of the most non-linear episodes we've ever done\".[45]\n\n\nThe season 9 premiere episode aired on September 23, 2013, and the one-hour series finale aired on March 31, 2014.[46]\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *How I Met Your Mother* characters\n\n* Main cast\n* ![Josh Radnor Ted Mosby](image)\n\nJosh Radnor   \nTed Mosby\n* ![Jason Segel](image)\n\nJason Segel  \nMarshall Eriksen\n* ![Cobie Smulders](image)\n\nCobie Smulders  \nRobin Scherbatsky\n* ![Neil Patrick Harris](image)\n\nNeil Patrick Harris  \nBarney Stinson\n* ![Alyson Hannigan](image)\n\nAlyson Hannigan  \nLily Aldrin\n* ![Cristin Milioti](image)\n\nCristin Milioti  \nThe Mother\n\n\n* Josh Radnor as Ted Mosby, an architect, college professor and the central character of the series. He tells the story of his adult years from his late twenties to his mid thirties, and all the obstacles he overcomes before he meets \"The One\" (the Mother). This story is told by the Older Ted Mosby, and narrator of the series, Bob Saget. Ted moved to New York City with his friends Marshall and Lily after graduating from Wesleyan University. In New York, he met Barney (at the urinal of MacLaren's) and Robin, to whom he was immediately attracted. Ted is on a quest for happiness and \"The One\", the woman he will marry. He has many relationships, one with Robin, that reveal the qualities he wants in his future wife. At the end of each relationship, with levity, he reflects on what went wrong. Although hope to find \"the one\" diminishes with each failed relationship, Ted does not give up. He has more elegant and higher-class interests than his friends. He goes to great lengths to profess his love to the women in his life, but they all falter eventually. Despite these qualities, Ted often acts immaturely, such as in wild activities with Barney. In the show's finale, he says that, in Tracy, he had met the love of his life (the titular Mother), but only after he is finished telling the story does he accept that he is ready to move on and admit he is still in love with Robin.\n* Jason Segel as Marshall Eriksen, Ted Mosby's best friend. Marshall and Ted were roommates at Wesleyan, and remained living together when they moved to New York. In season 2 Marshall marries Lily, with whom he has been in love since his freshman year of college; they have a child during season 7. Marshall was born in St. Cloud, Minnesota, where his family and culture are the foundation of major conflicts he faces in the series. He has an interest in the paranormal and mythical creatures, particularly Sasquatch. His dream to be an environmental lawyer conflicts with his immediate need for money, such as for his wedding and to raise his children. He however, eventually switches from his corporate job, to his dream, environmental lawyer job, taking the pay cut willingly to help protect the environment. By the end of the sitcom, he has become a New York supreme court judge.\n* Cobie Smulders as Robin Scherbatsky, a news anchor trying to make it as a journalist who dates both Ted and Barney. Robin emigrated from Canada to take a job at a news station and met Ted at MacLaren's; her Canadian background is a source of many jokes from her friends, for instance, \u2018Robin Sparkles\u2019 which was her stage name as a Canadian teenage pop-star. She is very career-centric and rejects traditional roles, such as getting married and having kids. Robin often drinks scotch and smokes cigars, and is an avid gun fan. She and Barney get engaged and marry in the penultimate episode of the series, but divorce in the first part of the series finale, three years later. Smulders's husband Taran Killam appeared in six episodes as Gary Blauman.\n* Neil Patrick Harris as Barney Stinson, a serial playboy, using his relative wealth and an array of outrageous strategies to seduce women with no intention of engaging in a relationship. His catchphrases include 'Suit Up' and 'Legen-wait-for-it-Dary'. He is Ted's other best friend. Abandoned by his father at a young age, Barney has abandonment issues and clings to his friends. He tells extravagant lies about events in his life as a defense mechanism for his substandard childhood. He marries Robin in the penultimate episode of the series but they divorce after three years in the two-part series finale. In 2020, a failed one-night stand gives him a daughter, Ellie. Harris' husband David Burtka appeared in seven episodes as Scooter.\n* Alyson Hannigan as Lily Aldrin, a kindergarten teacher, aspiring artist, and Marshall's wife. She is terrible at keeping secrets and can be manipulative at times. She marries Marshall in season 2 and gives birth to Marvin in season 7. Though appearing sweet and cute, Lily can be quite unexpectedly fierce. Her best girl friend is Robin, whom she met through Ted as he dated Robin. Hannigan's husband Alexis Denisof appeared in ten episodes as Sandy Rivers.\n* Cristin Milioti as The Mother, the titular character who is Ted's future wife. She makes her first official appearance in Season 8, and gradually meets all the characters throughout Season 9 leading up to her meeting Ted.\n\n\n## Season synopsis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *How I Met Your Mother* episodes\n\n| Season | Episodes | Originally aired | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First aired | Last aired |\n| 1 | 22 | September\u00a019,\u00a02005\u00a0(2005-09-19) | May\u00a015,\u00a02006\u00a0(2006-05-15) | 85 |\n| 2 | 22 | September\u00a018,\u00a02006\u00a0(2006-09-18) | May\u00a014,\u00a02007\u00a0(2007-05-14) | 61 |\n| 3 | 20 | September\u00a024,\u00a02007\u00a0(2007-09-24) | May\u00a019,\u00a02008\u00a0(2008-05-19) | 70 |\n| 4 | 24 | September\u00a022,\u00a02008\u00a0(2008-09-22) | May\u00a018,\u00a02009\u00a0(2009-05-18) | 49 |\n| 5 | 24 | September\u00a021,\u00a02009\u00a0(2009-09-21) | May\u00a024,\u00a02010\u00a0(2010-05-24) | 42 |\n| 6 | 24 | September\u00a020,\u00a02010\u00a0(2010-09-20) | May\u00a016,\u00a02011\u00a0(2011-05-16) | 48 |\n| 7 | 24 | September\u00a019,\u00a02011\u00a0(2011-09-19) | May\u00a014,\u00a02012\u00a0(2012-05-14) | 45 |\n| 8 | 24 | September\u00a024,\u00a02012\u00a0(2012-09-24) | May\u00a013,\u00a02013\u00a0(2013-05-13) | 42 |\n| 9 | 24 | September\u00a023,\u00a02013\u00a0(2013-09-23) | March\u00a031,\u00a02014\u00a0(2014-03-31) | 28 |\n\n\n\n\n\n### Season 1[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 1)\n\nIn 2030, Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) sits his children down to tell them the story of how he met their mother.\n\n\nThe series begins in September 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living with his two best friends from his college years: Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher and an aspiring artist. Lily and Marshall have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall finally proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), whom he met in the restroom at a bar four years earlier. Barney is a serial womanizer who concocts elaborate con games, usually involving costumes and fake identities, designed to bed women, only to lose interest in them immediately afterward.\n\n\nTed begins his search for his perfect soul mate and meets an ambitious young reporter from Canada, Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), with whom he quickly falls in love. Robin, however, does not want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Future Ted reveals that Robin is not the mother after referring to her as \"Aunt Robin\".\n\n\nTed begins dating a baker, Victoria (Ashley Williams), whom he meets at Stuart and Claudia's wedding, causing Robin to become jealous, and realize she does have feelings for Ted. Victoria is offered a fellowship in pastry-making, moves to Germany and she and Ted try a long-distance relationship. Once Ted learns Robin has feelings for him, he tells her he broke up with Victoria, even though he has not. They almost have sex when Victoria calls and Robin answers, mistaking Ted's phone for her own. Ted and Victoria then break up and an angry Robin distances herself from Ted, but they eventually reconcile and decide to date.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Lily begins to wonder if she has missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall, and decides to pursue an art fellowship in San Francisco, breaking up with Marshall in the process. The season ends with Ted returning to the apartment, the morning after spending the night with Robin for the first time, to find Marshall sitting in the rain with Lily's engagement ring, devastated by their sudden break-up after nine years. Marshall must then call off their wedding.\n\n\n\n### Season 2[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 2)\n\nTed and Robin are now a couple; meanwhile, a heartbroken Marshall tries to continue his life without Lily. After enduring numerous emotional breakdowns, Marshall's friends step in, and Barney, using sly catchphrases and pick-up lines, tries to get Marshall back in the dating game. Marshall becomes Barney's new \u2018wingman\u2019 as Ted is now in a relationship with Robin. Barney mentors Marshall in the art of flirting with women. Marshall fails at impressing women, but he finally obtains a barista's number. Later, Lily, after finally realizing she is not meant to be an artist, returns to New York. They remain separated as Marshall begins to date another girl, the barista whose number he earned, described by the gang as having 'crazy eyes'. The date with the girl does not end well and eventually leads to Lily and Marshall becoming reunited, and their engagement eventually resumes. When Robin refuses to go to the mall or explain why, Marshall suspects she is married, and Barney suspects she has performed in adult films. They bet on it, appointing Lily as \"Slap Bet Commissioner.\" Lily oversees the search for the truth, as they discover that Robin was a teenage pop star named \"Robin Sparkles\", and Marshall eventually earns the right to slap Barney five times whenever he wishes. He uses one slap immediately and another later in the season. It is revealed that Barney has a gay African American half-brother named James (Wayne Brady) and, unaware that his mother lied to him, believes that Bob Barker is his father. As a result of this he takes a trip to California to be a contestant on *The Price Is Right* to meet his \"father\". While on the show, Barney wins all the prizes and gives them to Lily and Marshall as a 'happy early wedding' present.\n\n\nIn the season finale, Ted reveals to Barney that he and Robin have been broken up for some time due to their conflicting views on marriage and children. They did not tell anyone, in order to avoid taking attention away from Lily and Marshall's wedding. The season ends with Barney's excitement by the prospect of being an unfettered single man with Ted again. Barney's final words are \"this is going to be legen- wait for it...\".\n\n\n\n### Season 3[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 3)\n\nBarney begins the season with the word, \"-dary!\" Robin returns from a trip to Argentina with her new boyfriend, Gael (Enrique Iglesias), and Ted must adjust to life as just her friend, while watching Robin and Gael fawning over each other. Marshall and Lily decide to move out on their own, falling in love with a place they cannot afford. Marshall is fighting his temptation to take a corporate job with high pay and focusing instead to follow his dream of becoming an environmental lawyer to protect the world from pollution. Robin learns of Lily's bad credit rating due to her compulsive shopping for designer brands, and forces Lily to tell Marshall. Despite this, they are able to finally secure their dream apartment, in Dowisetrepla, only to discover it is in a bad location (DOwnWInd of the SEwage TREatment PLAnt) and more poorly constructed than they thought (the floor is tilted). Barney is slapped for the third time on Thanksgiving, which Marshall dubs \"Slapsgiving.\"\n\n\nTed tells his children he met their mother through a story concerning her yellow umbrella. He finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick's Day party where his future wife was, although they did not meet. Ted attempts to woo Stella (Sarah Chalke), a dermatologist he sees to remove an embarrassing butterfly tattoo. This culminates in a \"two-minute date,\" which incorporates small talk, dinner, a movie, coffee, two cab rides, and a goodnight kiss. Robin sleeps with Barney after he comforts her following a break-up with a past Canadian love; Ted is infuriated, and decides to stop being friends with Barney.

Robin takes a new job in Japan, but quickly resigns and returns to New York to attend Ted's wedding, after realizing how much she misses her friends. Stella leaves Ted at the altar to get back together with Tony (Jason Jones), the father of her daughter. Barney struggles with his feelings for Robin as his company shifts him to the management team of a new acquisition, Goliath National Bank (GNB), where Marshall has accepted a position.\n\n\nMarshall and Lily move to their new apartment and debate over whether or not they are ready to have children. Robin is threatened to be deported for not having a job in her field, which opens an opportunity for Barney to spend time with Robin. Robin gets a job as an anchor for a 4 AM news show after Barney submits her video resume, and becomes roommates with Ted. Ted and Robin decide to sleep together constantly so they will not fight over each other's bad co-living habits. Barney attempts to make them stop fighting to prevent this, revealing to Ted his love for Robin.\n\n\nTed finds out Lily has sabotaged all of his relationships with anyone she does not approve of and indirectly may have inspired his breakup with Robin. Robin and Ted end up talking about it, causing their friendship to begin moving toward a positive note. After Barney finally sleeps with his 200th woman (and rubs it in the face of the childhood bully who taunted him into pursuing it), he begins to question the purpose of the remainder of his life, leaving him more certain of his feelings for Robin. Barney secures Ted a job to design the new Goliath National Bank headquarters. When the company later suspends the project, Marshall and Barney try to hide this fact from Ted. Ted starts his own architectural design company, Mosbius Designs, after getting laid off; however, he is too afraid of failing and refuses to call clients.\n\n\nTed, while carrying the yellow umbrella, bumps into Stella and Tony. Tony later decides to visit him, sympathizing with Ted over his loss of Stella. Tony offers Ted a job as a professor of architecture at Columbia University, which Ted initially turns down.\n\n\nIn the season finale Robin finds out that Barney loves her, and initially refuses to commit to anything but a sex-only relationship; they seemingly end up together anyway. Ted decides that being an architect is leading nowhere, and finally decides instead to become a college professor. The finale ends with Ted preparing to teach his first class and Future Ted revealing to his children that one of the women in the class is their mother.\n\n\n\n### Season 5[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 5)\n\nTed begins his job as a professor of architecture, standing in the middle of a classroom\u00a0\u2013 although the mother was present, it turns out to be an economics class as he's in the wrong lecture hall. Barney and Robin have had a sexual relationship throughout the summer and Lily locks them in a room, forcing them to come to terms with their relationship. After a rough patch they decide to break up. Robin describes it instead as \"two friends getting back together.\" Barney immediately goes back to his old ways, using the playbook to score with women. Throughout the season Barney and Robin show feelings of regret over their break-up.\n\n\nTed dates a graduate student named Cindy (Rachel Bilson) and it is revealed her roommate is his future wife. Robin meets Don Frank (Benjamin Koldyke), her new co-anchor on her 4 AM TV show. Though she initially dislikes him, the two start dating and eventually she moves in with him. At the end of the season they break up when Don takes a job in Chicago \u2014 a job which Robin had previously turned down to stay in New York with Don. Robin moves back into Ted's apartment. Lily's father, Mickey (Chris Elliott), who was absent during her childhood, makes an appearance at Thanksgiving. Mickey and Lily are able to mend their relationship at the end of the meal, where Marshall uses his fourth slap on Barney. Ted discovered that Tony, who stole Stella away from Ted at the altar, wrote a movie on Ted and Stella's relationship. The movie, \"The Wedding Bride,\" portrays Tony as the hero and Ted as the villain. The movie becomes popular and Ted unexpectedly sees it while on a date with another girl. He is infuriated by how he is portrayed in the movie, and views the actual story as the complete opposite. Ted buys a house, which needs to be fixed up badly, but is later revealed to be the future home for him and his children.\n\n\nLily and Marshall are still unsure about having children. After watching four doppelgangers of their group (Lesbian Robin, Moustache Marshall, Stripper Lily and Mexican Wrestler Ted) they decide to leave the big decision to the universe's \"infinite wisdom\" and start trying when they have seen Barney's doppelganger.\n\n\nIn the season finale, Barney disguises himself to have sex with a girl from every country in the world, and Lily and Marshall mistake him for the final doppelganger. When Marshall finds out, he decides not to tell Lily, fearing she will want to wait even longer to have children. Lily eventually finds out and decides to wait. Lily thinks she sees Barney's doppelganger as a hot dog vendor, which causes the group to realize she is seeing what she wants to see, and play along. Eventually Barney agrees having babies is not a stupid idea and Lily and Marshall should go forth. The season ends with Lily asking Marshall to \"put a baby in my belly\".\n\n\n\n### Season 6[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 6)\n\nIn the season opening, Ted sees Cindy again with a girl who he thinks to be her roommate, but she turns out to be Cindy's girlfriend whom she later marries. After prodding by Barney, Ted is eventually hired by GNB once more as the architect of the bank's new headquarters, which was originally scrapped in Season 4. However, he encounters opposition when he meets Zoey Pierson (Jennifer Morrison), a woman who is protesting against GNB for selecting a decrepit hotel, the Arcadian, to be torn down for the headquarters. Over the season, Ted's encounters with Zoey eventually blossom into a relationship after she divorces her rich husband, the Captain (Kyle MacLachlan). However, when their relationship is challenging and turbulent, they break up, leading to Ted supporting the Arcadian's demolition.\n\n\nHaving agreed to conceive a baby at the end of the previous season, Lily and Marshall keep having sex, hoping she will get pregnant. Around Christmas, they have a false alarm and later seek fertility testing. The fertility specialist, Dr. Stangel, turns out to be Barney's doppelganger, fulfilling their promise with the universe in regard to their decision to have a child. However, tragedy strikes when Marshall's father passes away, leaving him devastated and the gang comforting him. Marshall tries to get over his father's death and live again. Despite a pledge to Lily to work harder for their future, Marshall resigns from GNB and follows his dream of being an environmental lawyer. Zoey also hires him as her lawyer in what became a futile battle to save the Arcadian.\n\n\nBarney finally admits to the gang that Bob Barker is not his real father, especially when his mother decides to sell the house he grew up in and his brother, James, meets his own father. Loretta offers the identity of Barney's father on a sheet of paper, but Barney tears this up after realizing her efforts as a single mother. At the funeral of Marshall's father, Barney tells Loretta that he wants to see his father at last. The man, Jerry Whittaker (John Lithgow), is eventually revealed to be someone whom Barney thought was his uncle. Barney, who remembers Jerry as a fun-loving man, is disappointed after learning how Jerry has grown out of his free-wheeling ways. Although he tries to bring back Jerry's old behaviors, Barney admits that he wants to settle down someday. He is also introduced to Nora (Nazanin Boniadi), a co-worker of Robin, for whom he develops feelings. After an initial falling out, the two reconcile at the end of the season after Barney asks her for coffee.\n\n\nRobin continues to work at her talk show, *Come On, Get Up, New York!*, but the presence of a new hyperactive co-host forces her to leave. She is accepted as a researcher in another network, *World Wide News*. The gang also discovers more of her past as the Canadian pop star Robin Sparkles. Robin also encounters a man (Michael Trucco) she has had a secret crush on since first seeing him when she and Ted were dating, and Future Ted hints that they will see more of him later.\n\n\nIn the season finale, Ted makes the decision that he wants to get back with Zoey. Robin and Barney try to stop them from getting back together. Marshall's interview goes wrong as food poisoning hits him during the meeting; Lily's similar sickness was thought to be food poisoning as well, but is revealed to be morning sickness, as she has become pregnant. Barney and Robin get closure by helping Ted not get back together with Zoey. Short scenes during the season premiere and finale feature a wedding set sometime in the future, where Ted will meet his future wife. In the final scene of the season, the groom is revealed to be Barney.\n\n\n\n### Season 7[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 7)\n\nSeason seven opens with another flash forward, in which Ted is helping Barney get ready for his wedding to a still-unknown bride. In the present, Marshall gets a job in environmental law while Lily's pregnancy progresses. Barney proves to Nora that he can be a good boyfriend to her, while Robin is revealed to still have feelings for Barney. After a court case for assault, Robin receives mandated therapy. Robin meets a therapist, Kevin (Kal Penn), and they start to date. Meanwhile, after a period of unemployment since leaving GNB, Marshall finally manages to land his dream job at a top environmental law firm. After losing a bet, Barney is forced to wear a tie with a duck pattern on it (nicknamed the 'Ducky Tie') which he hates. Marshall allows him to take it off when meeting Nora's parents on the condition that Barney has three slaps added to the one still remaining from the Slap Bet. Marshall uses two slaps immediately, leaving two left.\n\n\nWhile reminiscing about Hurricane Irene, Lily and Marshall reveal that they conceived their baby in Barney's apartment, and Barney and Robin end up sleeping together. Barney and Robin decide to break up with their partners, but Robin reneges on the deal, returning to Kevin and leaving Barney alone and heartbroken. Robin has a pregnancy scare at Thanksgiving and tells Barney the child is his, since she and Kevin had not yet slept together. However, Robin's doctor informs her that she cannot have children at all. Kevin, who wants children, proposes to Robin, who decides that they must break up. Ted comforts Robin and reveals he still loves her, but the gesture is unrequited. Eventually, she moves out to give him some space.\n\n\nMarshall and Lily decide they want to move to Long Island, after Lily's paternal grandparents offer them their house there. Eventually, they move back to the old apartment in New York City after realizing suburban life is not for them. Ted gives them his apartment because he believes he cannot move on from Robin while living there, while he and Robin become estranged and do not speak for several weeks. Robin is eventually offered a news anchor job and subsequently achieves recognition after preventing a helicopter she is flying in from crashing.\n\n\nBarney starts dating a stripper named Quinn (Becki Newton), to the group's initial apprehension. The gang begins to meddle in their relationship, but Barney and Quinn outsmart their attempts and win their approval. Quinn moves in with Barney, while Ted rents Quinn's old apartment. Lily goes into labor and frantically calls Barney and Marshall, who are out at a casino in Atlantic City and heavily intoxicated. Barney helps Marshall arrive in time for Lily's delivery and chooses the middle name for the baby, Marvin Waitforit Eriksen. Ted and Robin's friendship also recovers as a result of Marvin's birth. As the season concludes, Marshall and Lily begin a new family with their baby, Marvin. Barney proposes to Quinn performing an extravagant magic trick in airport security. Ted contacts his old girlfriend Victoria; unhappy with her own impending wedding, she leaves her fianc\u00e9 for Ted and the pair drive off into the sunset. A final flash forward shows the day of Barney's wedding, where Robin is revealed as the bride.\n\n\n\n### Season 8[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 8)\n\nTed visits Robin on the day of her wedding to Barney, causing him to remember how he and Victoria ran away from her wedding to be together. The summer is spent with Ted, Barney, and Robin enjoying their current relationships; however, all subsequently break up with their partners. Victoria splits up with Ted over his friendship with Robin, Barney and Quinn break up due to their inability to trust each other, and Robin breaks up with Nick realizing his immaturity. Robin and Barney kiss but decide not to get together, despite Barney's wishes. Barney then begins dating Robin's hated co-worker Patrice (Ellen D. Williams), a relationship later exposed as a ruse to make Robin realize her true feelings for him. In a culminating scene, Barney proposes to Robin, who says yes.\n\n\nMarshall and Lily attempt to get used to being parents, which causes a brief estrangement from the gang as Baby Marvin takes up the majority of their time. Lily's father Mickey becomes Marvin's nanny, freeing the two up to spend more time with their friends. The Captain, ex-husband of Ted's old girlfriend Zoey, offers Lily a job as an art consultant after she identifies a painting that made a huge profit for him. Lily accepts, happy to finally achieve her dream of having a job in the art industry, while Marshall decides to apply to become a judge. The Captain offers Lily a year's work in Rome, which she accepts with Marshall's blessing. However, just before Barney and Robin's wedding, Marshall is informed that his application to become a judge has been granted, a development that would require them to stay in the US.\n\n\nTed briefly dates Jeanette (Abby Elliott), a girl who stalked him after he appeared on the cover of *New York Magazine* for designing GNB's headquarters. He quickly realizes he's made a mistake and breaks up with her. Ted's feelings of loneliness grow, especially as he is now the only single member of the group, and he decides he is truly ready to settle down. He argues with Lily over hiring a DJ or a band for Barney and Robin's wedding, but is forced to provide a band at short notice when Lily concedes the argument. During a chance meeting on the subway, Cindy offers the services of her roommate's wedding band. This roommate is Ted's future wife.\n\n\nAs the week of the wedding approaches, Robin has doubts about marrying Barney and shares an emotional moment with Ted. Feeling guilty, Ted realizes he cannot be around Barney and Robin after they are married and decides to move to Chicago the day after the wedding. The season concludes with everyone traveling to Barney and Robin's wedding, including the mother of Ted's children (revealed on screen for the first time and portrayed by Cristin Milioti), who is seen buying a train ticket to the venue and holding her yellow umbrella.\n\n\n\n### Season 9[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 9)\n\nWith the exception of the last episode, the entirety of season nine takes place in the 56 hours leading up to Barney and Robin's wedding.\n\n\nMarshall, who is stuck in Minnesota, desperately tries to find a way to get to the wedding in time. Meanwhile, in Farhampton, the time is slowly counting down to the wedding, with a new problem arising in almost every episode. It is revealed that Lily is pregnant and that she and Marshall will have a daughter. It is also revealed that Ted's children are named Penny and Luke. In the 200th episode, the Mother's eight years before meeting Ted are revealed, while later episodes give viewers a glimpse of Ted and the Mother together in flash forward scenes. Also, Marshall uses his final two slaps from the slap bet: the first being used as an apology present for missing the rehearsal dinner, and the second when Barney begins to panic just before the beginning of the wedding ceremony.\n\n\nIn the series finale, it is revealed that after three years of marriage, Barney and Robin decided to divorce. Barney ends up later fathering a child during a one-night stand. Marshall eventually becomes a judge, and he and Lily have three children. Ted's wife, whose name is revealed to be Tracy McConnell, dies of an unknown illness in 2024, six years prior to the time of Ted telling his children the full story of how they met. Upon finishing the story, at the urging of his kids, Ted decides to ask Robin out. Alluding to the first episode, the finale ends with Robin, as she looks out of her apartment window to see Ted holding the blue french horn, smiling with tears in her eyes.\n\n\nFollowing backlash from fans over the ending of the series, an alternative ending was cut together and released on the Season 9 DVD, in which future Ted narrates over the scene in which Ted and Tracy meet at the train station, recapping all major events from the series. He delivers the final line \"and that kids is how I met your mother\", and the episode ends, completely cutting the final scene with Penny and Luke.\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nThe first season was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, although some compared the series unfavorably to *Friends*. On Metacritic, a review aggregation site that collected 25 reviews for the series, it scored a 69 out of 100.[47] Michael Abernethy of *PopMatters* gave the season a negative review, writing that \"The comedy that does occur in *How I Met Your Mother* isn't enough to compensate for its inconsistencies.\"[48] Tom Shales of *The Washington Post* gave the season a lukewarm review, saying it's \"a little better than most other sitcoms, past and present -- especially those featuring wacky urban friends in their twenties experiencing the bittersweet mysteries of life.\"[49] Melanie Macfarlane of the *Seattle Post-Intelligencer* gave the season a positive review, saying the show \"may not break any comedic ground, but it's the sort of comfortable, reliable hitter CBS needs on Monday nights.\"[50]\n\n\nThe second season received critical acclaim. Staci Krause of IGN gave the season a positive review,[51] calling it \"great\".[52]\n\n\nThe third season was met with mostly positive reviews.[53] Michelle Zoromski of IGN gave the season a positive review, saying that \"the season was fun and clever, a good, consistent flow from the first two seasons\".[54]\n\n\nThe fourth season received critical acclaim. Michelle Zoromski of IGN gave Season 4 an overall rating of 8.5 out of 10, stating that \"This fourth season seemed to settle down the chase for the titular mother. While Ted was busy dating Stella, the gang settled into many stand alone episodes which were every bit as entertaining as episodes devoted to Ted's love life\". Zoromski went on to say: \"A stellar Robin-Marshall episode, titled 'Little Minnesota', makes it clear that these two do not get enough screen time together. With Robin homesick and unemployed (and at risk of being deported), this pairing brought out the best Robin Sparkles reference of the season, when Marshall leads a rousing karaoke version of 'Let's Go to the Mall!'\"[55]\n\n\nThe fifth season received mixed reviews. Cindy McLennan of *Television Without Pity* gave the season a mixed review, and at the end of the season wrote: \"I'm okay with any given season not being primarily focused on mother-meeting, but this season, the characters seemed to regress -- particularly Barney and Ted. Usually, when a season ends, I have to deal with a week or two weeks' worth of letdown. Right now, all I'm feeling is relief.\"[56]\n\n\nThe sixth season received generally positive reviews.[57] Justin Fowler of *Later Reviews* gave the season a positive review, saying that the season was \"a pretty good season of television\" and better than the \"poor\" fifth season. He also said that \"Seventeen out of the 24 episodes are what I would consider good\".[58]\n\n\nThe seventh season received mixed reviews. Alan Sepinwall gave the season a mixed review and criticized the flash-forwards throughout the season, saying that \"the show is just much, much stronger when its stories dwell on matters of the present or the past, and where the writers don't have to act like magicians trying to keep the audience from figuring out how the trick works. And the finale affirmed that belief for me. The parts that had little or nothing to do with things to come were quite good; the parts that were all about the future made me roll my eyes and ask, for the umpteenth time, 'Really? This is where you're going with this?'\"[59]\n\n\nThe eighth season received mixed reviews and is often considered the worst season of the series. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 54% of critics gave the show a positive review. The consensus reads: \"*How I Met Your Mother* wears out its welcome this season, with an anticlimactic reveal and rote, less-than-fruitful humor.\"[60]\n\n\nThe ninth season received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, though fans found it worse than prior seasons.[61] Rotten Tomatoes reported that 80% of critics gave the show a positive review, with an average rating of 7.3 out of 10.[62] Gareth Mitchell at \"House of Geekery\" responded negatively, mostly criticizing the structure of the season, stating that they are \"struggling to come up with stories that last out the 22 minutes\".[63]\n\n\nThe finale of the show received a largely negative reaction from critics and fans. Some complained that the last few seasons (particularly the final season before the finale which took place over one weekend) had built towards an end game that was discarded within the hour-long episode, while others defended it as true to both the initial concept of the show and to life itself.[64] In the years succeeding its airing, it continued to be singled out as one of the worst television series finales,[65][66][67] e.g., topping *USA Today*'s list of \"Worst Series Finales of All Time\".[68]\n\n\n\n## Tie-ins[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* *The Bro Code*, cited by Barney many times throughout the series, is a set of written rules for bros to follow, and has been published as a tie-in novel, an audiobook,[69] an iPhone Application and an Android Application. Barney alleges it was written by Barnabus Stinson, a contemporary of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. Many of the rules listed in this book also appear in the show's closing vanity cards in syndication.\n* *Bro on the Go*, a companion to *The Bro Code*, released in 2009.[70]\n* *Bro Code for Parents: What to Expect When You're Awesome*, released in 2012.[71]\n* *The Playbook,* based on the fifth season episode of the same name, by Barney Stinson and Matt Kuhn.[72]\n* *How I Met Your Mother and Philosophy*, released in 2013.[73]\n\n\n### Soundtracks[edit]\n\n\nMain article: How I Met Your Music (Original Songs from the Hit Series \"How I Met Your Mother\")\n\n* A soundtrack album entitled *How I Met Your Music: Original Songs from the Hit Series* was released digitally to iTunes on September 24, 2012, featuring songs from the first seven seasons[74]\n* A second soundtrack album entitled *How I Met Your Music: Deluxe* was released digitally to iTunes on September 23, 2014, featuring songs from the final two seasons.[75]\n\n\n### Pineapple Incident explained[edit]\n\n\nAfter the end of the series, the officials released a short video, explaining the running mystery of the pineapple in \"The Pineapple Incident\", the tenth episode of the first season. The extra footage revealed that a character featured in the 6th season, the Captain (Kyle MacLachlan), had put a pineapple in front of his door as a tradition and Ted took the pineapple while he was drunk.[76]\n\n\n\n### Websites[edit]\n\n\nWebsites were consistently mentioned throughout the How I Met Your Mother series. Many of the websites directly tie in to running gags on the show. CBS turned nearly every website mentioned in the series into a real functioning website.

Talks of the series being \"shopped\" to other networks emerged.[107][108] Netflix, FOX and NBC were named as possible candidates for picking up the show.[109]\n\n\nUltimately, nothing came of those talks. It was reported that the options on the cast contracts had expired and they had been released from their contracts and co-creator Carter Bays denied any rumors that the spin-off pilot will be reshot.

Founded in 1831 as a men's college under the Methodist Episcopal Church and with the support of prominent residents of Middletown, the college was the first institution of higher education to be named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. It is now a secular institution.\n\n\nThe college accepted female applicants from 1872 to 1909, but did not become fully co-educational until 1970. Before full co-education, Wesleyan alumni and other supporters of women's education established Connecticut College in 1912.[5][6] Alumni of the college include three Truman scholars, three Guggenheim fellows, and seven MacArthur fellows. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Wesleyan University\n![](image)The Samuel Wadsworth Russell House (1828), home to the Philosophy department. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001 and is considered one of the finest examples of domestic Greek Revival architecture.[7]\nThree written histories of Wesleyan have been published, *Wesleyan's First Century* (1932) by Carl F. Price; *Wesleyan University, 1831\u20131910: Collegiate Enterprise in New England* (1999); and *Wesleyan University, 1910-1970, Academic Ambition and Middle-Class America* (2015), the latter two by David B. Potts. Before Wesleyan was founded, a military academy established by Captain Alden Partridge existed on the land, consisting of the campus's North and South Colleges. As this academy failed, New England Methodists bought it and transformed it into a scholarly institution. Wesleyan was founded in 1831 as an all-male Methodist college by the Methodist conference.[8] It was led by Willbur Fisk, its first president.[8] Despite its name, Wesleyan was never an officially denominational seminary, though its curriculum and campus religious life were shaped by a heavy Methodist influence.[9] In the 1870s and 1880s, Wesleyan began gaining a regional reputation for its creative extracurricular offerings, particularly in music and writing.[*clarification needed*] In 1909, it built Judd Hall, named after alumnus Orange Judd, one of the earliest academic buildings devoted exclusively to undergraduate science instruction on any American college or university campus.[10][11][12]\n\n\nThe Wesleyan student body numbered about 300 in 1910[13] and had grown to 800 in 1960. *Time* described the latter population as \"small\" for a university.[14]\n\n\nWesleyan is a member of the Little Three, along with Amherst and Williams colleges. Although Wesleyan developed as a peer of Amherst and Williams, until the 1970s it continued to be the smallest of the Little Three institutions. At that time it began to expand its programs, qualifying as a university with graduate programs and eventually becoming larger than the other two.[15][16]\n\n\n\n![](image)The rear of College Row: From left to right: North College, South College, Memorial Chapel, Patricelli '92 Theater (not pictured: Judd Hall)\nIn 1872, the university became one of the first U.S. colleges to attempt coeducation by admitting a small number of female students,[11] a venture then known as the \"Wesleyan Experiment\". \"In 1909, the board of trustees voted to stop admitting women as undergraduates, fearing that the school was losing its masculine image and that women would not be able to contribute to the college financially after graduation the way men could.\"[17] From 1912 to 1970, Wesleyan operated again as an all-male college.[18]\n\n\nWesleyan became independent of the Methodist church in 1937. In 2000, the university was designated as a historic Methodist site.[19]\n\n\nBeginning in the late 1950s, president Victor Lloyd Butterfield[20] began an ambitious program to reorganize the university according to Butterfield's \"College Plan.\" This resembled Harvard's house system and Yale's colleges. Undergraduate study would be divided into seven smaller residential colleges, with their own faculty and centralized graduate studies. Doctoral programs and a Center for Advanced Studies (later renamed the Center for the Humanities) were included in this reorganization.[21][22][23]\n\n\nThe building program begun under this system created three residential colleges on Foss Hill (the Foss Hill dormitories), followed by three more residential colleges (the Lawn Avenue dormitories, now called the Butterfield Colleges). Although the structures were built, only four of the proposed academic programs were begun. Two of those continue today: the College of Letters and the College of Social Studies.[14][21] Butterfield proved effective at fund raising: by 1960 Wesleyan had the largest endowment, per student, of any college or university in America, and a student-faculty ratio of 7:1.[24]\n\n\nButterfield's successors, Edwin Deacon Etherington (class of 1948)[25] and Colin Goetze Campbell,[26] completed many of the innovations begun during Butterfield's administration, including the return of women in numbers equal to men;[27] a quadrupling in the total area of building space devoted to laboratory, studio, and performing arts instruction; and a significant rise in racial, ethnic, and religious diversity and total number of students.[25][28][29][30][31]\n\n\nThe university and several of its admissions deans were featured in Jacques Steinberg's 2002 book *The Gatekeepers: Inside The Admissions Process of a Premier College*.[32][33] In the fall 2007 semester, Michael S. Roth, a 1978 graduate of Wesleyan and former president of the California College of the Arts, was inaugurated as the university's 16th president.[34]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The view from Foss Hill: From left to right: Judd Hall, Harriman Hall (which houses the Public Affairs Center), and Olin Memorial Library\nWesleyan occupies a 360-acre (1.5\u00a0km2) campus, with over 340 buildings, including the five-building College Row; Olin Memorial Library (see below); Andrus Public Affairs Center; the Exley Science Center; Shanklin and Hall-Atwater Laboratories; the Van Vleck Observatory; Fayerweather with Beckham Hall; Russell House, a National Historic Landmark; the Allbritton Center; the Butterfield dormitories; the Fauver Field dormitories; and the 11-building Center for the Arts complex.[35][36]\n\n\nWhen Wesleyan University was founded in 1831, it took over a campus on which two buildings, North College and South College, had already been built in 1825. They were originally constructed by the City of Middletown for use by Captain Partridge's American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy. In 1829, after the Connecticut legislature declined it a charter to grant college degrees, Capt. Alden Partridge moved his academy to Northfield, Vermont. The academy later became Norwich University and the Middletown buildings were acquired by Wesleyan. The book, *Norwich University, 1819-1911, Vol. I* (1911), provides the following description of South College (originally called the Lyceum) and North College (called the Barracks).[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Clark Hall, a freshman dormitory built in 1916 and renovated in 2002\nThese structures were constructed out of brown sandstone that was mined from quarries in Portland, Connecticut. The \"Barracks\" was four stories high, 150 feet long and 52 feet wide, with a large attic and basement. Halls extended the full length of the building. The \"Lyceum\" was located 20 feet south of the Barracks, was three stories high, with a basement partly above the ground. At the front of the building was a tower 14\u00d716 feet and 73 feet high. The basement floor was used for an arsenal and laboratory and the first and second floors for classrooms; the third floor called the \"Hall of the Lyceum\" was used as a chapel and drill room, and for public services.[38]\n\n\nThe original North College was destroyed in a fire in 1906, but South College survived, being converted into offices that same year. The cupola and the belfry, which contains the Wesleyan Carillon, was designed by Henry Bacon and was added in 1916.[39]\n\n\nThe original core buildings of the campus were North College and South College. North College, Nassau Hall-type building seen in most early American college campuses, was replaced after a fire in 1909 with the current North College. South College is the sole building from the beginning of the college. These two buildings were the first two in a line of six later called College Row. The other buildings of row include the recently renovated Memorial Chapel, the original college library (now a theater), and Judd Hall. Adjacent to College Row, Olin Library, Harriman Hall, Shanklin Hall, and the former Hall Chemistry Building were designed by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White as a set (with Clark Hall and a never-built sixth building) to form a quadrangle.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe northern end of High Street contains several large buildings that were former private residences, a few of which were exceptional architectural examples. These include Russell House, a National Historic Landmark, two Alsop family houses, (one is currently the African-American Studies center with student housing; the other is the Davison Art Center), the Davison infirmary, a second Russell family house that contains the University Development Office, and Downey House. High Street, which is the old center of campus, was once described by Charles Dickens as \"the most beautiful street in America\".[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)The front side of Allbritton Center, the building on Wesleyan's campus which houses the Jewett Center for Community Partnerships, Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, and the Wesleyan Media Project, as well as the student\u2013run cafe Espwesso.[41]\nRecent building initiatives include the Freeman Athletic Center (which includes a 50-m swimming pool, the Spurrier-Snyder Rink for hockey, the 1,200-seat Silloway Gymnasium, the 7,500-square-foot (700\u00a0m2) Andersen Fitness Center, and the Rosenbaum Squash Center with eight courts); the Center for Film Studies; and a multibuilding renovation project creating a Humanities District on the east side of High Street between Fisk Hall and Russell House, which includes facilities for the departments of English, Romance Languages, the College of Letters, Classical Studies, Philosophy, and Art and Art History. The Allbritton Center (previously the Davenport Student Center, and before that Scott Lab) opened in the fall of 2009 and houses the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life, the Shapiro Creative Writing Center, the Quantitative Analysis Center, and the Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program.[42][43]\n\n\nThe Usdan University Center, which opened in September 2007, has dining facilities for students and faculty. It also houses seminar and meeting spaces, the Wesleyan Student Assembly, Student Activities and Leadership Development Office, University Events and Scheduling Office, the post office, and the computer store. In 2012, 41 Wyllys Ave. opened in the former squash building as the new home for the College of Letters, Art History Program, and the Wesleyan Career Center.\n\n\n\n## Undergraduate academics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may contain an excessive number of citations**. Please help remove low-quality or irrelevant citations. *(July 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nWesleyan's 46 undergraduate academic departments offer over 900 courses each semester and more than 900 individual tutorials.[44][45] Wesleyan also offers 13 interdisciplinary programs and nine Academic Centers.[46][47][48][49] Undergraduates receive the Bachelor of Arts in one (or more) of 45 major concentrations.[50][51][52] As many as a third of these majors are interdisciplinary in structure.[53] Wesleyan began offering minors in February 2012 and at present offers eleven minors; more minors are under consideration.[54][55] Certificates are offered in eleven fields.[54] In addition, double majors are popular and up to 40% of Wesleyan's graduates are double majors.[53] Students may triple major as well.[56] Undergraduates can also pursue a custom-designed major, known as a University Major.[57] According to the Columbia Encyclopedia, \"Wesleyan is noted for its undergraduate programs of tutorial instruction and independent study.\"[58] Approximately 52% of students undertake independent study.[59]\n\n\nWesleyan offers 3\u20132 programs in engineering with the California Institute of Technology and Columbia University's School of Engineering. These programs allow undergraduates to receive degrees in five years from both Wesleyan (B.A.) and Caltech or Columbia (B.Sc., Engineering).[58][60][61] Additionally, Wesleyan offers a BA/MA Program in the sciences leading to a bachelor's degree in the fourth year and a master's degree in the fifth year. Tuition for the fifth year of the master's degree is waived.[62] Undergraduates can pursue studies in pre-medicine, pre-law, and pre-business through any major.[63] Most classes at Wesleyan are small; the predominant class size for undergraduates is 10\u201319 students, and the student to faculty ratio is 8 to 1.[64][65]\n\n\nThe university has described a set of general principles that define its approach to undergraduate education summed up in ten essential capabilities that the faculty believe every undergraduate should possess when he or she graduates from Wesleyan.[56][66][67] Students may acquire these capabilities through numerous courses throughout the curriculum designated by the faculty and through extra- or co-curricular activities.[66][68][69][70][71] Writing is emphasized across the disciplines and 99% of undergraduates participate in Wesleyan's Writing Across the Curriculum program.[72]\n\n\nWesleyan does not require undergraduates to take prescribed courses.[73][74] Freshmen are offered First Year Initiative seminars, which are designed to prepare them for upper-level courses by emphasizing writing, analysis, discussion, and critical thinking.[75] Undergraduates are encouraged in the first two years of study to take a minimum of two courses from two different departments in each of three areas: natural sciences and mathematics, humanities and the arts, and social and behavioral sciences.[76] In the second two years, undergraduates are expected to take one course in each of these three areas. Fulfillment of the General Education Expectations in conjunction with co-curricular activities provides simultaneous acquisition of the ten essential capabilities. \"A student who does not meet these [general education] expectations by the time of graduation will not be eligible for University honors, Phi Beta Kappa, honors in general scholarship [honors or high honors], and for honors in certain departments.\"[53][77]\n\n\nIts most popular undergraduate majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:[78]\n\n\n\n* Econometrics and Quantitative Economics (67)\n* Psychology (65)\n* Political Science and Government (64)\n* English Language and Literature (48)\n* Behavioral Neuroscience (38)\n* Film/Cinema/Media Studies (38)\n\n\n![](image)The Butterfield Colleges\n### Bailey College of the Environment[edit]\n\n\nThe Bailey College of the Environment (COE), created in 2009, integrates the following components: 1) a curricular component, including the newly established environmental studies major, the environmental studies certificate, and a senior capstone project; 2) a Think Tank of Wesleyan faculty, scholars of prominence, and undergraduates whose aim is to produce scholarly work that will influence national and international thinking and action on critical environmental issues; and 3) the Collaborative Research Initiative (CRI), which is designed to encourage COE majors with the most potential to undertake environmental research. The threefold goal of the CRI combines: a) preparing students for senior research work; b) recruiting students of exceptional skill for participation in the COE Think Tank; and c) preparing students for research careers in environmental studies, as well as facilitating internships (non-credit) to provide students with research opportunities and \"real world\" experience (e.g., internships with governmental organizations, NGO's, and businesses, etc.).[79][80][81]\n\n\n\n### College of Film and the Moving Image[edit]\n\n\nThe university's Film Studies program is led by film historian Jeanine Basinger.[82] In 2008, *Vanity Fair* said: \"This tiny Connecticut University, with a total enrollment of 2,700, has turned out a shockingly disproportionate number of Hollywood movers and shakers.\"[83][84] Similarly, in 2008, *Variety* magazine noted Basinger's contribution to the film industry through her work in the Wesleyan Film Studies program, and the large number of alumni of the program now working in Hollywood.[85] University students, biographers, media experts, and scholars from around the world may have full access to The Wesleyan Cinema Archives, which document the film industry during the 20th century and contain the personal papers and film related materials of Ingrid Bergman, Frank Capra, Clint Eastwood, Federico Fellini, Elia Kazan, Frank Perry, Roberto Rossellini, Robert Saudek, Martin Scorsese, Gene Tierney, Raoul Walsh, and John Waters, amongst others.[86][87]\n\n\nIn February 2013, Wesleyan announced the creation of a new College of Film and the Moving Image, incorporating the Film Studies Department, the Center for Film Studies, the Cinema Archives and the Wesleyan Film Series.[88]\n\n\n\n### College of Integrative Sciences[edit]\n\n\nThe College of Integrative Sciences (CIS) is the most recent interdisciplinary college at Wesleyan, founded in 2014. The CIS provides students with an interdisciplinary education in the sciences, and combines it with hands-on problem solving skills in research. To build interdisciplinary expertise, students must complete both a traditional major in science or mathematics, as well as a \"linked\" major that combines components from other disciplines to form a coherent plan of study.[89]\n\n\n\n### College of Letters[edit]\n\n\nThe College of Letters (COL) is an interdisciplinary humanities program offering a three-year B.A. major for the integrative study of European literature, history, and philosophy, from antiquity to the present. During their time in the major, students explore the evolution of ideas, languages, narratives, beliefs, and ideologies associated with the Mediterranean, Europe, and the Atlantic as effective tools for pursuing an historically informed and critical understanding of the contemporary world and its various forms of cultural, artistic, and intellectual expression.[90] The college emphasizes a pedagogy of collaboration, interdisciplinary inquiry, and creative exploration around the idea of the \"Educated Imagination.\"[91]\n\n\n\n### College of Social Studies[edit]\n\n\nThe College of Social Studies (CSS) was founded in 1959, combining the fields of history, economics, government, and philosophy. It emphasizes intellectual independence and collaborative and social ties between faculty and students. Students take 5.5 of the program's 10.5 (thesis-writing students take 11.5) required credits during their sophomore year. Sophomore year focuses on the development of modern Western society from historical, economic, social and political perspectives, and culminates with comprehensive final exams. Junior year has a more global focus, while Seniors are required to write an Honors thesis (full year) or a Senior Essay.[92][93][94]\n\n\n\n### Science and mathematics[edit]\n\n\nAccording to National Science Foundation (NSF) research and data, the university ranks first nationally among liberal arts colleges in federal funding for research in the sciences and mathematics. Wesleyan is the sole undergraduate liberal arts college to be designated a Molecular Biophysics Predoctoral Research Training Center by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).[95] Medical school acceptances of Wesleyan graduates have historically averaged above 90%, and in some years Wesleyan has recorded an acceptance rate of 100%.[96][97]\n\n\nWesleyan was one of the first colleges to establish a separate Molecular Biology & Biochemistry department.[96]\n\n\n\nAstronomy program\nMain article: Van Vleck Observatory\n\nThe Astronomy department graduates more astronomy and astrophysics majors than any other liberal arts college in the country.[98]\n\n\n\nScience in Society\nWesleyan's Science in Society Program (SISP) is an interdisciplinary major that encourages integrated study of the sciences and medicine as practices, institutions, and intellectual achievements, among other areas of study. The program has three components: science courses, SISP courses, and an area of concentration (which may include a major in one of the sciences). The program encourages students to integrate technical scientific understanding with a grasp of the multiple contexts in which scientific knowledge is applied, and the issues at stake in its application.[99]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nWesleyan's program in World Music, described as \"one of the top schools in the country for the study of ethnomusicology\"[100][101] and music, employs leading teaching musicians and ethnomusicologists, representing a variety of musical traditions. European (including Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, Impressionistic, Expressionistic, Neoclassical, Neoromantic, Gebrauchsmusik, 20th century, Contemporary, and Opera), South Indian Classical, Indonesian (including Javanese Gamelan), East Asian, classical Chinese music, Korean music, Japanese music, including Taiko drums; West African, Caribbean, African-American, as well as Experimental music have been components of the music department since the 1960s.[102] The Experimental music work at Wesleyan dates to the residency of John Cage at the university. He was followed by composers Alvin Lucier, Ron Kuivila, and Jon Barlow. Composer Beatrice Witkin's papers are archived at Wesleyan.\n\n\nAmong universities, Wesleyan \"has one of the largest and most diverse collections of world musical instruments,\"[103] many of which are depicted in the university's \"Virtual Instrument Museum.\"[104]\n\n\n\n### Theater[edit]\n\n\n![](image)'92 Theater\nWesleyan's highly regarded theater program has two theater facilities: the Theatre in the Center for the Arts, a 400-seat space; and the '92 Theater, home to Second Stage, which solely student-run volunteer theater organization. Second Stage produces at least one performance per weekend during the school year, either in the fully equipped black-box Patricelli '92 Theater, or alternative spaces around campus. Second Stage produces dance as well as theater performances. The Patricelli '92 Theater (then simply *'92 Theater*) became available for student-run productions when the Center for the Arts opened in 1974, providing the Theater Department with a state-of-the-art facility.[105][106][107]\n\n\n\n### International study[edit]\n\n\nWesleyan sponsors, among others, international programs in France, Italy, and Spain, and has special relationships with programs in Japan. Nearly 45 percent of Wesleyan students study abroad through 150 programs located in 50 countries worldwide.\"[108]\n\n\n\n### Twelve College Exchange[edit]\n\n\nMany students participate in the Twelve College Exchange program, which allows for study for a semester or a year at another of the twelve college campuses: Amherst, Bowdoin, Connecticut College, Dartmouth, Mount Holyoke, Smith, Trinity, Vassar, Wellesley, Wheaton, and the Williams/Mystic Seaport Program in Maritime Studies.[109][110]\n\n\n\n## Post-graduate academics[edit]\n\n\nDepartmental programs\nWesleyan has 11 graduate departmental programs in the sciences, mathematics, computer science, psychology, and music.[111] Graduates receive the Master of Arts or Doctor of Philosophy degrees.[108] Like in many traditional liberal arts colleges in the United States, all of Wesleyan's master's and bachelor's degrees are designated \"of Arts\" by historical precedent, regardless of the field of study.[112][113]\n\n\n\nGraduate Liberal Studies Program\nIn 1953, Wesleyan was the first university to begin a program leading to a Master of Arts in Liberal Studies degree, called the Graduate Liberal Studies Program.[114] To date, hundreds of educational institutions have followed suit with similar programs.[115] The program provides for interdisciplinary graduate study independent of the undergraduate academic departments.[116]\n\n\nA large proportion of G.L.S.P. students are public and private school teachers from the region, and the others are in different professions or are otherwise augmenting their graduate studies.[117]\n\n\n\nMassive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)\nBeginning in 2012, Wesleyan became the first small liberal arts college to partner with a private consortium to design and offer free public access online courses.[118] Wesleyan teaches online courses in Math, Computer Science, Law, Psychology, and Literature, as well as other subjects. In January 2015, total worldwide student enrollment in online courses taught by Wesleyan faculty exceeded 1,000,000.[119]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nFor the Class of 2027 (enrolling Fall 2023), Wesleyan received 14,500 applications and accepted 2,280 (15.7%).[120] The median SAT score for admitted freshmen was 770 for math and 750 for evidence-based reading and writing.[120] The median ACT score was 34 for the composite.[120] Since 2014, Wesleyan has been test optional.[121]\n\n\nAdmission standards at Wesleyan are considered \"most selective\" by *U.S. News & World Report*.[122] The Princeton Review gives the university an admissions selectivity rating of 96 out of 99.[123]\n\n\nWesleyan announced in July 2023 that it would no longer give preference in admission to applicants with family or donor ties to the school, officially ending legacy admission at the institution.[124][125]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| Liberal arts |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[126] | 11 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[127] | 3 |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[128] | 42 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[129] | 43 |\n\n\nIn the 2024 *U.S. News & World Report* rankings, Wesleyan University is tied for 11th overall among national liberal arts colleges, first in \"Best Colleges for Veterans\", 16th in \"Best Value Schools\", and tied for 36th in \"Top Performers on Social Mobility\".[130] Wesleyan University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[131]\n\n\nIn the 2023 *Forbes* ranking of 650 American colleges, which combines national research universities, liberal arts colleges and military academies in a single survey, Wesleyan University is ranked 42nd overall and 6th among liberal arts colleges alone. In another recent Forbes ranking, Wesleyan placed ninth nationally and third among liberal arts colleges.[132] According to a study entitled \"Revealed Preference Ranking\" published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Wesleyan ranks No.\u00a022 among all colleges and universities, and No.\u00a05 among liberal arts colleges only.[133] The stated purpose of the NBER study was to produce a ranking system that \"would be difficult for a college to manipulate\" by basing it on the actual demonstrated preferences of highly meritorious students.[133] Wesleyan was listed on the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education's 2016 \"10 Worst Colleges for Free Speech\".[134]\n\n\n*Washington Monthly* ranked Wesleyan third in 2022, out of 203 liberal arts colleges in the U.S., based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.[135]\n\n\nIn 2019 *Kiplinger* ranked Wesleyan 16th of the 149 best value liberal arts colleges in the United States.[136]\n\n\nThe university is notable for the success with African American students, in which Wesleyan is one of nine universities with a black graduation rate above 90 percent.[137]\n\n\n\n### After graduation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may contain an excessive number of citations**. Please help remove low-quality or irrelevant citations. *(February 2021)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nWesleyan has been noted as one of the most productive baccalaureate colleges in the United States in the undergraduate origins of PhDs in all fields of study, with exceptional productivity in undergraduates pursuing doctorates in the physical sciences, geosciences, life sciences, psychology, social sciences, and humanities.[96][138][139][140] According to studies undertaken by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies, for the years 1999\u20132008, 1999\u20132003, and 1994\u20132003, Wesleyan undergraduates were second in receiving PhDs among all liberal arts colleges in the nation.[138][141][142] For example, the university produces more history doctorates per undergraduate history major than any other liberal arts college or national research university in the United States (with the exception of the University of Chicago which tied for first place with Wesleyan in a study (by the American Historical Association) of history PhDs earned between 1989 and 2002).[143]\n\n\nAccording to a 2003 summary, women constituted 55.3% of Wesleyan's undergraduates who received doctorates.[141]\n\n\nEighty percent of Wesleyan alumni attend graduate or professional school within five years of graduation.[144][145] In 2011, *Newsweek* ranked Wesleyan eighteenth in their list of the nation's best colleges and universities for paying back graduates in future earnings and quality experience.[146][147]\n\n\nWesleyan graduates are awarded external fellowships, including Fulbright, Goldwater, Marshall, Rhodes, Truman, and Watson.[148][149] For the years 2004 through 2012, for example, Wesleyan was named a \"Top Producer of Fulbright Awards for American Students\" by the Institute for International Education.[150][151][152][153][154][155][156] For the years 2007 through 2011, a total of 42 Wesleyan students and alumni received scholarships under the Fulbright program.[157][158][159][160][161] \nThe university has had at least 87 Watson Fellows since the inception of the program in 1968.[162]\n\n\n\n## Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The front facade of Olin Memorial Library.\nWesleyan University has an extensive library collection, most of which is housed in Olin Memorial Library, which has more than 1.8\u00a0million volumes and approximately 10,000 serial subscriptions.[163][164][165] Wesleyan's first library was Rich Hall (now '92 Theater), which was built just after the Civil War.[105][166]\nOlin Library was designed by the firm of McKim, Mead, and White, built in 1925\u201327 and dedicated in 1928.[164]\n\n\nThe second largest library on campus is the Science Library, which houses over two hundred fifty thousand volumes of science abstracts, books, journals, monographs, papers, periodicals, and surveys.[167]\n\n\nThe Art Library is housed on the second floor of Olin Library. Davison Art Center holds the Print Reference Library. There is also a Music Library (which includes scores and recordings and the World Music Archives) and several department libraries.[168]\n\n\n\n## Davison Art Center[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alsop House\nWesleyan University's Davison Art Center is in Alsop House, which is designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark.[169][170] The Art Center has a large collection consisting primarily of works on paper, including 18,000 prints, 6,000 photographs, several hundred drawings, a small number of paintings, and three-dimensional objects (including artists' books, sculptures, and other objects).[171][172][173] The print collection is considered to be one of the most important at an American university, with works by D\u00fcrer, Goya, Rembrandt, Manet, and others.[174][175]\n\n\nThe museum's educational program includes student museum internships and student-curated exhibitions.[174][176][177]\n\n\n\n## Wesleyan University Press[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wesleyan University Press\n\nThe Wesleyan University Press is well regarded for its books of poetry[178] and books on music, dance and performance, American studies, and film.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Chapel, a multi-denominational space built in 1871.\n### Cannon Scrap[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Douglas cannon\n\nIn the late 1860s, a yearly contest, the \"Cannon Scrap,\" began between the freshmen, whose mission it was to fire the Douglas Cannon on February 22, and the sophomores, who were charged with foiling the effort. In 1957, the tradition of stealing the cannon began in earnest.[179][180][*clarification needed*]\n\n\n\n### Religious life[edit]\n\n\nUntil June 2020, the university employed a Jewish rabbi, a Catholic priest, a Protestant chaplain, and a Muslim chaplain.[181] The university proposed that current chaplain positions \"will all be gradually phased out until one chaplain remains to oversee all aspects of University religious life.\"[182]\n\n\nThere is program housing for Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, and Jews.[183]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wesleyan Cardinals logo\n![](image)Wesleyan Natatorium\nWesleyan is a member of the Division III New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), fielding intercollegiate varsity teams in 29 sports. It competes against traditional Little Three rivals Amherst and Williams. Approximately 600 students participate in intercollegiate varsity sports each year.[184] Wesleyan is one of the 39 founding members of the NCAA.[185] Wesleyan's football and baseball field, Andrus Field, is the oldest continuously used American football field in the world[186][187] and the oldest continuously used baseball field in the world.[188]\n\n\nWith alumnus including Bill Belichick, Eric Mangini, and Field Yates, the school has been described by ESPN as a \"hotbed for great football minds.\"[189] Led by coach John Raba the winningest lacrosse coach in NESCAC history the Wesleyan's Men's Lacrosse team won the Division III NCAA championship title in 2018. It was the first national championship in school history.\n\n\nAmos Magee helped lead Wesleyan University to an ECAC Soccer Championship and school-best record of 15\u20131\u20131 in 1991, and is the Cardinals' all-time leading scorer (35 goals and 85 points).[190] He was a National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) Division III All-American in 1992, four times was named all-New England,and was inducted into the Wesleyan University Hall of Fame.[191]\n\n\n\n### Student groups and organizations[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2011, *U.S. News & World Report* described the university as one of \"20 Colleges Where It's Easiest to Get Involved\" with a \"Students per Club\" ratio of \"11.66\". At that time there were around 270 student groups available to the 3,148 enrolled students.[192]\n\n\n\n#### Wesleyan Student Assembly[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wesleyan Student Assembly\n\nThe Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) is a body of 38 students elected annually to represent Wesleyan University's undergraduate student body. The members of the assembly serve as student advocates in all areas of the university, including matters related to student life, academics, university finances, and campus facilities.[193][194][195][196]\n\n\n\n#### Debate[edit]\n\n\nThe Debate Society was founded in 1903[*citation needed*] and later named in honor of[*citation needed*] Woodrow Wilson, who had been a professor at Wesleyan between 1888 and 1890 and who \"became deeply involved in extracurricular student activities such as the [Wesleyan] debate society.\"[197] He \"stimulated students to organize opportunity for debate through a House of Commons similar to the one he had started at Johns Hopkins in 1884.\"[198][199]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental[edit]\n\n\nAnother student group is the Environmental Organizers' Network (EON), which campaigns on environmental issues.[200][201] Wesleyan also owns a tract of land that is used as Long Lane Farm, a 2-acre (8,100\u00a0m2) organic vegetable farm run by students.[202]\n\n\n\n#### Publications[edit]\n\n\nSome of the oldest and most visible student groups are campus publications, including a bi-weekly newspaper, *The Wesleyan Argus* and a periodical, *Hermes*, the university's oldest student-run publication.[203] Until 2008, the student body published the *Olla Podrida* which was originally a quarterly newspaper in the late 1850s, but was the college yearbook since the Civil War. The *Argus* is the campus newspaper.[204] Wesleying is a student-run weblog that documents undergraduate life at Wesleyan, often receiving up to 10,000 page views a day.[205]\n\n\n\n#### Singing groups[edit]\n\n\nWesleyan was long known as the \"Singing College of New England.\"[206] The university's \"tradition as a 'singing college' had its roots in the vitality of Methodist hymnody.\"[207] In 1862, a university glee club made the first tour of Wesleyan singers. The Wesleyan glee club organized by students frequently traveled and performed from the mid-19th century through the mid-20th century[208][209] and was considered among the best collegiate glee clubs in the late 19th century.[210] It traveled widely giving concerts, including being received twice at the White House (in 1901 by President McKinley and again in 1928 by President Coolidge) and being recorded onto a phonograph record by Thomas Edison.[210] University alumni published the first edition of *The Wesleyan Song Book* in 1901.[208] Subsequently, the Glee Club twice won the National Intercollegiate Glee Club Competition at Carnegie Hall.[211] Since the Glee Club's disbanding, the tradition of choral singing has been carried on by the Wesleyan Singers, later renamed the Wesleyan Concert Choir, and then renamed again The Wesleyan Ensemble Singers (2010). This tradition also continues today in several student-run a cappella groups on campus, including the Wesleyan Spirits, the university's oldest group. There are at least 10 groups that perform on campus regularly,[212] with others occasionally created and disbanded.\n\n\n\n### Greek organizations and secretive societies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Original Mystical Seven\nWesleyan has chapters of Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha Psi Alpha, Chi Psi, Psi Upsilon, and Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE).[213]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Wesleyan ordered all fraternities with on-campus housing to become co-educational within the next three years.[214]\nIn 2015, Wesleyan University ordered the closure of the DKE fraternity house on High Street. In 2017, DKE won the claim against Wesleyan University in a court trial. The jury awarded damages of $386,000 to the Kent Literary Club, DKE's Wesleyan alumni chapter.[215]\n\n\nSecretive societies on campus include the Skull & Serpent,[216] Theta Nu Epsilon,[217] Cloak, The Cannon Society, Pigs of Patio, and two Mystical Sevens.\n\n\n\n### International students[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, around 10 percent of the student body holds citizenship other than that of the United States.[5] There is financial aid available for students from Africa and Asia.[9]\n\n\n\n## Literary, media, and cultural references[edit]\n\n\nMore than 30 books have been published concerning the university, including: *The Wesleyan Song Book*, by Karl P. Harrington and Carl F. Price (1901);\n[218] *The Goose-Step: A Study of American Education*, by Upton Sinclair (1923); *Wesleyan's First Century With an Account of the Centennial Celebration*, by Carl F.

They include *30 Rock*,[231][232] *As the World Turns*,[233][234] *How I Met Your Mother* (characters Ted Mosby, Marshall Eriksen, Lily Aldrin),[235][236] *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*,[237] *The West Wing*,[238] *BoJack Horseman*,[239][240] and *M\\*A\\*S\\*H*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe 1994 cult comedy film *PCU* was based on (and filmed in part at) Wesleyan, the alma mater of the screenplay's two writers, Adam Leff and Zak Penn, and represents \"an exaggerated view of contemporary college life....\"[241] centering on a fictionalized version of the Eclectic Society, known in the film as \"The Pit.\"[242][243][244]\n\n\nIn the autumn of 2010, the Pulitzer prize-winning comic strip *Doonesbury* by Garry Trudeau featured the university in a series of daily strips.[245]\n\n\nIn 2015, Rolling Stone published a long form feature on Wesleyan's drug culture titled \"Inside the Wesleyan Molly Bust\",[246] where dozens of students overdosed on tainted ecstasy, leading to the expulsion of five students.\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and faculty[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Wesleyan University people and List of Wesleyan University people in politics and government\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.
