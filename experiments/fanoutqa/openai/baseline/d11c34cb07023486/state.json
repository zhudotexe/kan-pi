The team improved on their 4\u201312 record in 2014 under former head Coach Rex Ryan. Under new head coach Todd Bowles, they succeeded in matching their previous season\u2019s win count in just five games, starting 4\u20131. Prior to the season, the Jets made a number of moves, including, re-acquiring Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie, two cornerbacks who were instrumental in the Jets previous defensive success, and obtaining Ryan Fitzpatrick and Brandon Marshall in trades. The team regressed to 5\u20135, before going on a five-game winning streak, clinching their first winning season since 2010. However, it wasn't enough to make the playoffs, as they lost to the Buffalo Bills in Week 17 and the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Cleveland Browns. The Steelers, who also finished 10\u20136, clinched the final AFC playoff spot over the Jets based on a better record vs. common opponents. The Jets finished the season as the league's only team with a winning record to not make the playoffs, and as of 2023, this was the last Jets team to post a winning record. This was also tied with the 2020 Miami Dolphins season as the closest quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick came to making the playoffs in his 17-year career.\n\n\n\n\n## Transactions[edit]\n\n\n### Coaching and staff personnel changes[edit]\n\n\n* The Jets fired general manager John Idzik and head coach Rex Ryan on December 29, 2014.[1]\n* Offensive line coach Mike Devlin left the Jets to accept the same position with the Houston Texans on January 9, 2015.[2]\n* The Jets hired Mike Maccagnan as general manager on January 13, 2015.[3]\n* The Jets hired Todd Bowles as head coach on January 14, 2015.[4]\n* Jets defensive coordinator Dennis Thurman, defensive line coach Karl Dunbar, linebackers coach Bobby April III, defensive backs coach Tim McDonald, assistant defensive line coach Jeff Weeks, and assistant strength and conditioning coach Jason Oszvart were hired to the same positions by the Buffalo Bills on January 15, 2015.

New York scored 17 unanswered, however the Jets couldn't capitalize on many opportunities and Philadelphia won 24-17. The Eagles remain as the only NFL team that the Jets have never defeated in franchise history, as the Eagles improved their all-time head-to-head record against the Jets to 10\u20130.[80] This game was also known for Brandon Marshall\u2019s attempt to pitch the ball backwards to his teammate, which result in a fumble recover for the Eagles.\n\n\n\n### Week 4: at Miami Dolphins[edit]\n\n\n**NFL International Series**\n\n\n\n**Week Four: New York Jets at Miami Dolphins\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Jets** | 10 | 10 | 7 | 0 | **27** |\n| Dolphins | 0 | 7 | 0 | 7 | **14** |\n\n\n*at Wembley Stadium, London, England*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: October 4\n* **Game time**: 2:30\u00a0p.m. BST/9:30\u00a0a.m. EDT\n* **Game weather**: 59\u00a0\u00b0F (15\u00a0\u00b0C), sunny\n* **Game attendance**: 83,986\n* **Referee**: Craig Wrolstad\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(CBS)**: Ian Eagle, Dan Fouts and Evan Washburn\n* Recap, Gamebook\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* Chris Ivory 3-yard TD run.

The Patriots would win the toss, choosing heads. However, instead of receiving the ball to give Tom Brady the first chance to score, the Patriots elected to kick. This caused much confusion in Patriots captain Matthew Slater, as he questioned after the toss if the Patriots, because they won the toss, would also get to choose which end of the field they would like to kick. However, referee Clete Blakeman said \"You elected to kick\", and the Patriots were unable to choose which end of the field to kick off to, as in the NFL rule book, the team that loses the coin toss gets to choose which end to receive the ball, if the team that wins the toss elects to defer. If the team that wins the coin toss receives, the team that loses the toss will elect which way to kick. The Jets would get the ball first. They would march right down the field to score the game-winning touchdown on their first possession as Ryan Fitzpatrick found Eric Decker to end the game with a touchdown. With their fifth straight win, the Jets improved to 10-5.\n\n\nAs of 2023, this is the last time that the Jets have beaten the Patriots.\n\n\n\n### Week 17: at Buffalo Bills[edit]\n\n\n**Week Seventeen: New York Jets at Buffalo Bills\u00a0\u2013 Game summary**\n\n\n\n| Period | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jets | 0 | 7 | 10 | 0 | **17** |\n| **Bills** | 7 | 9 | 3 | 3 | **22** |\n\n\n*at Ralph Wilson Stadium, Orchard Park, New York*\n\n\n\n* **Date**: January 3, 2016\n* **Game time**: 1:00\u00a0p.m. EST\n* **Game weather**: 35\u00a0\u00b0F (2\u00a0\u00b0C), cloudy\n* **Game attendance**: 68,670\n* **Referee**: Walt Anderson\n* **TV announcers\u00a0(CBS)**: Ian Eagle, Dan Fouts and Evan Washburn\n* Recap, Gamebook\n\n\n\n| Game information\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **First quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Tyrod Taylor 18-yard run (Dan Carpenter kick), 5:55. *Bills 7\u20130. **Drive: 3 plays, 25 yards, 1:19.***\n\n**Second quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Karlos Williams 2-yard run (kick failed), 13:02. *Bills 13\u20130. **Drive: 13 plays, 70 yards, 6:21.***\n* NYJ \u2013 Brandon Marshall 17-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick (Randy Bullock kick), 9:42. *Bills 13\u20137. **Drive: 3 plays, 60 yards, 1:26.***\n* BUF \u2013 Dan Carpenter 20-yard field goal, 0:27. *Bills 16\u20137. **Drive: 15 plays, 70 yards, 9:16.***\n\n**Third quarter**\n* NYJ \u2013 Randy Bullock 39-yard field goal, 13:24. *Bills 16\u201310. **Drive: 4 plays, 2 yards, 0:49.***\n* BUF \u2013 Dan Carpenter 37-yard field goal, 5:05. *Bills 19\u201310. **Drive: 14 plays, 66 yards, 8:19.***\n* NYJ \u2013 Eric Decker 21-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick (Randy Bullock kick), 1:15. *Bills 19\u201317. **Drive: 11 plays, 77 yards, 3:52.***\n\n**Fourth quarter**\n* BUF \u2013 Dan Carpenter 42-yard field goal, 3:53. *Bills 22\u201317. **Drive: 13 plays, 56 yards, 6:54.***\n | **Top passers**\n* NYJ \u2013 Ryan Fitzpatrick \u2013 16/37, 181 yards, 2 TD, 3 INT\n* BUF \u2013 Tyrod Taylor \u2013 18/28, 182 yards\n\n**Top rushers**\n* NYJ \u2013 Chris Ivory \u2013 6 rushes, 81 yards\n* BUF \u2013 Tyrod Taylor \u2013 10 rushes, 51 yards, TD\n\n**Top receivers**\n* NYJ \u2013 Brandon Marshall \u2013 8 receptions, 126 yards, TD\n* BUF \u2013 Sammy Watkins \u2013 11 receptions, 136 yards\n\n**Top tacklers**\n* NYJ \u2013 David Harris \u2013 14 tackles, 2.0 sacks\n* BUF \u2013 Corey Graham \u2013 6 tackles\n\n\n |\n |\nWith the loss, and with the Steelers defeating the Browns the same day, the Jets finished their season 10-6 and were eliminated from the playoffs. This was also the first time since 2004 that one NFL team defeated another twice in the same season and both games ended with the same score. The Jets were also seeking a 6-game winning streak for the first time since 1986. It was also quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick's first return to Buffalo since the Bills released him following the 2012 season. Fitzpatrick played for the Bills from 2009 to 2012.\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Johnson, Woody (December 29, 2014). \"Johnson Official Statement on Idzik and Ryan\". New York Jets.

Fitzpatrick started at quarterback for nine different teams, the most in league history. He is also the only NFL player to have both a passing and rushing touchdown with eight different teams.\n\n\nFitzpatrick played college football at Harvard University, where he was the school's first quarterback to have over 1,000 rushing yards, and was selected by the St. Louis Rams in the seventh round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Fitzpatrick's longest stint was with the Buffalo Bills for four seasons, while his only two winning seasons were with the 2015 New York Jets and the 2020 Miami Dolphins. As a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2018, Fitzpatrick became the first NFL quarterback to throw for over 400 yards in three consecutive games. He holds the most career passing yards and passing touchdowns among NFL quarterbacks without a postseason appearance.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nWhile an economics student at Harvard University, Fitzpatrick had five starts for the Crimson during the 2001 and 2002 seasons, working as the backup for Neil Rose.[3] In 2002, Fitzpatrick recorded 1,155 passing yards with eight touchdowns and no interceptions to go along with 523 rushing yards and five touchdowns.\n\n\nAfter Rose graduated in 2003, Fitzpatrick took over the starting job and finished his junior campaign with 1,770 yards, 16 touchdowns, and eight interceptions in seven games. Additionally, he ran for 430 yards and six touchdowns, leading his team to a 7\u20133 record.[4]\n\n\nIn 2004, Fitzpatrick was named the Ivy League Player of the Year and winner of the George H. \"Bulger\" Lowe Award, as he accumulated 1,986 yards with 13 touchdowns and six interceptions. He also led Harvard to a 10\u20130 record, thus winning the Ivy League Championship.[5] He ranked second on the team with 448 rushing yards and five scores.\n\n\nFor his career, Fitzpatrick ranked second on Harvard's career list for pass completions, touchdowns, passing yards, and pass completion percentage, topped only by Neil Rose.[*citation needed*] Fitzpatrick's 641 pass attempts rank fourth in school history and his 1,006 total plays for 6,721 yards in total offense broke the old school career records of 1,005 plays by Mike Giardi (1991\u201393) and 6,519 yards by Rose.[*citation needed*] Fitzpatrick was also the school's first quarterback to rush for over 1,000 career yards.[6]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\nLike most incoming NFL rookies, Fitzpatrick took the Wonderlic test. Fitzpatrick completed the test in nine minutes, with rumors indicating that he obtained a perfect score of 50.[7] However, a 2005 *The Wall Street Journal* report said that Fitzpatrick scored a 48, which is still considered exceptionally high. While his actual score is unknown, Fitzpatrick has acknowledged leaving at least one question blank, making 49 his highest possible score.[8] To date, Fitzpatrick has the highest reported Wonderlic test score achieved among NFL quarterbacks. The only player to earn a verified perfect score on the Wonderlic was also a Harvard graduate: wide receiver/punter Pat McInally, who played his entire career for the Cincinnati Bengals.[9]\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-draft measurables\n| Height | Weight | Arm length | Hand span | 40-yard dash | 10-yard split | 20-yard split | 20-yard shuttle | Three-cone drill | Vertical jump | Broad jump | Wonderlic |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\u00a0ft 2+3\u20448\u00a0in(1.89\u00a0m)\n | 232\u00a0lb(105\u00a0kg)\n | 31+1\u20448\u00a0in(0.79\u00a0m)\n | 10+3\u20444\u00a0in(0.27\u00a0m) | 4.87 s | 1.71 s | 2.83 s | 4.07 s | 7.09 s | 30.5\u00a0in(0.77\u00a0m) | 8\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in(2.67\u00a0m) | 48 |\n| All from NFL Combine.[10][11][12] |\n\n\n### St. Louis Rams[edit]\n\n\n#### 2005 season[edit]\n\n\nThe St. Louis Rams selected Fitzpatrick in the seventh round (250th overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft. Fitzpatrick was the last of 14 quarterbacks drafted in 2005.[13]\n\n\nOn July 18, 2005, the Rams signed Fitzpatrick to a three-year, $953,000 contract.[14] Throughout training camp, Fitzpatrick competed for a roster spot against Jeff Smoker to be the Rams' third-string quarterback. Head coach Mike Martz named Fitzpatrick the third-string quarterback on the depth chart to begin his rookie season, behind Marc Bulger and Jamie Martin. Fitzpatrick was upgraded to the primary backup role in Week 6 after Bulger sustained a shoulder injury and was placed on injured reserve.\n\n\nOn November 27, 2005, Fitzpatrick made his professional regular season debut after entering the game in the second quarter against the Houston Texans to replace injured veteran journeyman Jamie Martin. Fitzpatrick completed 19 of 30 passes for 310 yards and three touchdowns for a 117.4 quarterback rating and led the Rams from a 24\u20133 halftime deficit to a 33\u201327 overtime road victory.[15] He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort.[16] This made Fitzpatrick one of only eight players who passed for more than 300 yards in their NFL debut. The win earned him the next three starts, making Fitzpatrick the first Harvard quarterback to start an NFL game.[17]\n\n\nFitzpatrick was unable to duplicate his debut performance in the games he started with the Rams coming two weeks later in a 27\u201313 road loss to the Minnesota Vikings, throwing for 235 yards and five interceptions for a QB rating of 32.4 for the game.[18] Fitzpatrick was replaced by Martin after halftime the following week, after struggling in a home game against the Philadelphia Eagles in which he completed just 41.7% of his passes for a total of 69 yards.[19]\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished his rookie season completing 76 of 153 passes for 777 yards, four touchdowns, and eight interceptions to go along with 14 carries for 64 yards and two touchdowns in four games and three starts.[20]\n\n\n\n#### 2006 season[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Fitzpatrick appeared in only one game, appearing late in the regular season finale against the Minnesota Vikings in relief of Marc Bulger and ran out the clock in the 41\u201321 road victory.[21]\n\n\n\n### Cincinnati Bengals[edit]\n\n\n#### 2007 season[edit]\n\n\nOn September 1, 2007, Fitzpatrick was traded to the Cincinnati Bengals for a seventh-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft.[22]\n\n\n\n#### 2008 season[edit]\n\n\nA restricted free agent in the 2008 offseason, Fitzpatrick signed his one-year tender offer from the Bengals on April 17.\n\n\nDue to an elbow injury to starting quarterback Carson Palmer, Fitzpatrick made his first Bengals start on September 28, 2008, against the Cleveland Browns. Fitzpatrick was not only the leading passer but also the leading rusher in the 20\u201312 loss, finishing with 156 passing yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions to go along with 41 rushing yards.[23] Palmer returned the next week to start against the Dallas Cowboys, but once again had to sit the following week to rest his elbow.[24] On October 12, 2008, Fitzpatrick got the start against the New York Jets and every other game for the rest of the season.\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished the season with 1,905 passing yards, eight touchdowns, and nine interceptions to go along with 60 carries for 304 yards and two touchdowns in 13 games and 12 starts.[25] His 304 rushing yards ranked third among quarterbacks behind Tyler Thigpen and David Garrard.[26]\n\n\n\n### Buffalo Bills[edit]\n\n\n#### 2009 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fitzpatrick with the Buffalo Bills in 2009\nOn February 27, 2009, Fitzpatrick signed a three-year, $7.4 million contract with the Buffalo Bills.[27]\n\n\nFitzpatrick made his first appearance on October 18, 2009, against the New York Jets when starter Trent Edwards went down with an injury. Fitzpatrick threw for 116 yards, a touchdown, and an interception and led the Bills to a 16\u201313 overtime victory.[28] He started the following two games, resulting in a 20-9 road victory over the Carolina Panthers and a 31-10 loss to the Houston Texans.[29][30]\n\n\nOn November 18, 2009, Fitzpatrick was named the starter by interim head coach Perry Fewell who took over the coaching duties after former head coach Dick Jauron was fired. Fitzpatrick went 3\u20133 as a starter under Fewell, throwing for 1,060 yards, seven touchdowns, and six interceptions. Fitzpatrick went 5\u20134 in games where he had a majority of the playing time for a team that finished with a 6\u201310 record. During a Week 11 18-15 road loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, Fitzpatrick threw a 98-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens, the longest touchdown reception and pass for both Owens and Fitzpatrick, also setting the team record for the longest touchdown pass.[31][32]\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished the 2009 season with 1,422 passing yards, nine touchdowns, 10 interceptions, and rushed for 141 yards and a touchdown on 31 carries in 10 games and eight starts.[33]\n\n\n\n#### 2010 season[edit]\n\n\nNew head coach Chan Gailey decided to go with Trent Edwards as the starter for the 2010 season, relegating Fitzpatrick to the backup role. On September 20, 2010, he was named the new starting quarterback following the Bills' 0\u20132 start.[34]\n\n\nDuring a Week 11 49\u201331 comeback road victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, Fitzpatrick threw for 316 yards and four touchdowns, including three to Stevie Johnson, and two interceptions.[35] Despite the Bills finishing at 4\u201312 (4\u20139 with him at quarterback), Fitzpatrick recorded at least one touchdown pass in 13 consecutive games and becoming the first Bills quarterback to pass for at least 3,000 yards in a season since J. P. Losman in 2006.[36]\n\n\nOverall, Fitzpatrick finished the season with 3,000 passing yards, 23 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions to go along with 40 carries for 269 yards in 13 games and starts.[37]\n\n\n\n#### 2011 season[edit]\n\n\nDuring a Week 2 comeback 38-35 victory over the Oakland Raiders, Fitzpatrick led the Bills to touchdown drives on five straight possessions in the second half.[38] It was the first time in league history a team had scored offensive touchdowns on five straight possessions in the second half.[39] He was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month for September.\n\n\nOn October 28, 2011, Fitzpatrick signed a six-year, $59 million contract extension including a $10 million signing bonus with the Bills.[40] He had three 300-yard performances in the 2011 season, with a season-high 369 yards during a Week 3 34-31 comeback victory over the New England Patriots.[41]\n\n\nAfter the 2011 season, it was revealed that Fitzpatrick had broken his ribs in a game against the Washington Redskins, which was presumably a factor in his decline in play over the rest of the season. Fitzpatrick finished the 2011 season with 3,832 yards, 24 touchdowns, and a league-leading 23 interceptions to go along with 56 carries for 215 yards in 16 games and starts.[42]\n\n\n\n#### 2012 season[edit]\n\n\nFitzpatrick returned as the Bills' starter in 2012, finishing with 3,400 passing yards, 24 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions to go along with 48 carries for 197 yards and a touchdown in 16 games and starts.[43] Following Chan Gailey's firing after the season, the Bills opted not to hold on to Fitzpatrick, releasing him on March 12, 2013.[44]\n\n\n\n### Tennessee Titans[edit]\n\n\nOn March 18, 2013, Fitzpatrick signed a two-year contract with the Tennessee Titans.[45]\n\n\nDuring a Week 4 38\u201313 victory over the New York Jets, Fitzpatrick made his Titans debut, replacing an injured Jake Locker in the third quarter. Fitzpatrick completed three of eight passes for 108 yards and a 77-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington.[46]\n\n\nFitzpatrick played in 11 games and started in nine of them. He finished the season with a 3\u20136 record as the starting quarterback, beating division rivals Jacksonville Jaguars and Houston Texans in the final two games of the season. Fitzpatrick completed the season throwing for 2,454 yards, 14 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions to go along with 43 carries for 225 yards and three touchdowns.[47]\n\n\nFitzpatrick was released on March 14, 2014, and replaced by Charlie Whitehurst.[48]\n\n\n\n### Houston Texans[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fitzpatrick in 2014\nOn March 18, 2014, Fitzpatrick signed a two-year contract with the Houston Texans.[49] He was named the Texans' starting quarterback by new head coach Bill O'Brien on June 17,[50] but was demoted to second on the Texans' depth chart on November 5, 2014, being replaced by Ryan Mallett.\n\n\nOn November 23, 2014, Mallett tore his pectoral muscle and Fitzpatrick was renamed the starter.[51] During a Week 13 45\u201321 victory over the Tennessee Titans in Week 13, Fitzpatrick threw for a franchise-record six touchdowns and 358 yards with no interceptions and a 147.5 passer rating.[52] He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort against the Titans.[53]\n\n\nDuring the second quarter of a Week 13 17-10 loss to the Indianapolis Colts, Fitzpatrick scrambled for a two-yard gain, was tripped up, and ended up with a fractured left tibia, ending his season. Fitzpatrick was replaced by rookie Tom Savage, who also received a minor injury.[54] Fitzpatrick finished with 2,483 passing yards, 17 touchdowns, and eight interceptions for a then career-high 95.3 passer rating to go along with 50 carries for 184 yards and two touchdowns and a 6\u20136 record as the starting quarterback for the Texans.[55]\n\n\n\n### New York Jets[edit]\n\n\n#### 2015 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fitzpatrick in 2015\nOn March 11, 2015, Fitzpatrick was traded to the New York Jets for a late-round conditional draft pick in the 2015 NFL Draft.[56][57] The move reunited Fitzpatrick with his former head coach Chan Gailey, who was hired during the off-season as the Jets offensive coordinator and play-caller. Following an incident in the locker room, in which starting quarterback Geno Smith suffered a broken jaw after being punched by linebacker IK Enemkpali, Fitzpatrick was tentatively named the Week 1 starter for the Jets.[58]\n\n\nMaking his first start for the Jets in the season-opening 31-10 victory over the Cleveland Browns, Fitzpatrick threw for 179 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the 31\u201310 victory.[59] In the next game against the Indianapolis Colts on *Monday Night Football*, he threw for 244 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception as the Jets won on the road by a score of 20\u20137.[60] The following week against the Philadelphia Eagles, Fitzpatrick threw for 283 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions in the 17\u201324 loss.[61] During a Week 4 27-14 victory over the Miami Dolphins at Wembley Stadium in London, Fitzpatrick threw for 218 yards, a touchdown, and an interception.[62] Two weeks later against the Washington Redskins, Fitzpatrick threw for 253 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception while also rushing for 31 yards and a touchdown in the 34\u201320 victory.[63] During a Week 7 30-23 road loss to the New England Patriots, Fitzpatrick threw for 295 yards and two touchdowns.[64]\n\n\nDuring the first quarter of a Week 8 34-20 loss to the Oakland Raiders, Fitzpatrick suffered torn ligaments in his left thumb while scrambling and did not play for the remainder of the game, being relieved by Geno Smith. Fitzpatrick underwent thumb surgery two days later and stated that he would still start.[65] In the next game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Fitzpatrick threw for 272 yards with two touchdowns as the Jets won by a score of 28\u201323.[66] The following week on *Thursday Night Football* against the Buffalo Bills, he threw for 193 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions as the Jets lost by a score 22\u201317.[67] During a Week 11 24-17 road loss to the Houston Texans, Fitzpatrick threw for 216 yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions to go along with five carries for 12 yards and a touchdown.[68]\n\n\nDuring a Dolphins rematch in Week 12, Fitzpatrick made his 100th career start by throwing for 277 yards and four touchdowns in the 38\u201320 victory.[69] In the next game against interconference-rival New York Giants, Fitzpatrick threw for 390 yards and two touchdowns as the Jets won on the road by a score of 23\u201320 in overtime.[70] The following week against the Tennessee Titans, he had 263 passing yards and three touchdowns in a 30\u20138 victory to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[71][72] During a Week 15 19-16 road victory over the Dallas Cowboys, Fitzpatrick threw for 299 yards, a touchdown, and an interception.[73] This was Fitzpatrick's ninth win of the season as a starter, securing his first winning season as a starting quarterback.[74] In the next game against the Patriots, Fitzpatrick finished with 296 passing yards and three touchdowns, including an overtime drive that gave the Jets a game-winning touchdown for a 26\u201320 victory.[75] For his effort against the Patriots, Fitzpatrick earned another AFC Offensive Player of the Week award.[76] In the regular-season finale against the Bills, Fitzpatrick threw for 181 yards, two touchdowns, and three costly interceptions (all in the fourth quarter) as the Jets lost on the road by a score of 22-17 and were eliminated from playoff contention after the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Cleveland Browns, despite finishing the year with a 10\u20136 record.[77]\n\n\nHaving started in all 16 games of the 2015 season, Fitzpatrick finished with 3,905 passing yards, 31 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions, breaking Vinny Testaverde's 1998 franchise record for most touchdown passes in a season. Fitzpatrick also had 60 carries for 270 yards and two touchdowns.[78][79]\n\n\n\n#### 2016 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fitzpatrick in 2016\nFitzpatrick, a free agent after the 2015 season, signed a one-year fully guaranteed $12 million contract with the Jets on July 27, 2016.[80]\n\n\nDuring the narrow season-opening 23-22 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, Fitzpatrick threw for 189 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception.[81] In the next game on *Thursday Night Football* against the Buffalo Bills, he improved gradually with 374 passing yards and a touchdown, leading the Jets to a 37\u201331 victory to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[82][83] The following week against the Kansas City Chiefs, the Jets committed eight turnovers, including Fitzpatrick throwing six interceptions. Fitzpatrick finished with 188 passing yards as the Jets lost on the road by a score of 24\u20133.[84] During a Week 6 28-3 road loss to the Arizona Cardinals, Fitzpatrick was benched for Geno Smith after going 16-for-31 for 174 yards, no touchdowns, and an interception.[85]\n\n\nSmith was then named the starter for the next game against the Baltimore Ravens.[86] However, he suffered a season-ending injury and was replaced by Fitzpatrick in the second quarter.[87][88] Fitzpatrick then started the team's next two games against the Cleveland Browns and Miami Dolphins before sitting out against the Los Angeles Rams due to injury.[89] Bryce Petty started in his place even though Fitzpatrick was still active for the game as the backup.[90] Fitzpatrick then returned from his injury to start the next two games against the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts.[89] However, during the Colts game, he was benched for Petty to start the second half.[91]\n\n\nPetty was then named the starter for the final four games of the season. Jets head coach Todd Bowles said, \"The plan was for us to start him the last four games anyway, so we just started a half early.\"[92] Petty then started the next three games against the San Francisco 49ers, Miami Dolphins, and New England Patriots.[93] During the Dolphins game, Fitzpatrick relieved Petty due to injury early in the fourth quarter.[94] Petty also suffered an injury in the Patriots game and was replaced by Fitzpatrick in the second quarter.[95] Due to Petty's injury, Fitzpatrick started in the regular season finale, completing 20 of 30 passes for 210 yards and two touchdowns as the Jets beat the Bills by a score of 30\u201310.[96]\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished the 2016 season with 2,710 passing yards, 12 touchdowns, and 17 interceptions to go along with 33 carries for 130 yards in 14 games and 11 starts.[97]\n\n\nOn February 15, 2017, Fitzpatrick's contract was voided, and he became a free agent.[98]\n\n\n\n### Tampa Bay Buccaneers[edit]\n\n\n#### 2017 season[edit]\n\n\nOn May 19, 2017, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Fitzpatrick to a one-year, $3 million contract.[99][100][101][102]\n\n\nDuring a Week 6 38-33 road loss to the Arizona Cardinals, Fitzpatrick entered the game after starter Jameis Winston suffered a shoulder injury in the second quarter. Fitzpatrick finished the game by completing 22 of 32 passes for 290 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.[103] Three weeks later against the New Orleans Saints, Fitzpatrick entered the game after Winston suffered another shoulder injury, completing eight of 15 passes for 68 yards and a touchdown in the 30\u201310 road loss.[104] On November 6, head coach Dirk Koetter said that Winston would miss at least two weeks to rest his shoulder.[105] Fitzpatrick started in Week 10 against his former team, the New York Jets, throwing for 187 yards, a touchdown, and an interception as the Buccaneers won by a score of 15\u201310.[106] In the next game against the Miami Dolphins, Fitzpatrick threw for 275 yards and two touchdowns as the Buccaneers won on the road by a score of 30\u201320.[107] The following week against the Atlanta Falcons, he threw for 283 yards as the Buccaneers lost on the road by a score of 34-20.[108]\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished the 2017 season with 1,103 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and three interceptions to go along with 15 carries for 78 yards in six games and three starts.[109]\n\n\n\n#### 2018 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fitzpatrick in 2018\nOn March 9, 2018, Fitzpatrick signed a one-year contract extension with the Buccaneers.[110] Starter Jameis Winston was handed a three-game suspension, making Fitzpatrick the Buccaneers' starting quarterback to begin the season.\n\n\nDuring the season-opening 48-40 road victory over the New Orleans Saints, Fitzpatrick completed 21 of 28 passes for a career-high 417 yards and four touchdowns, while also rushing for 36 yards and a touchdown, finishing with a 156.2 QB rating.[111] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[112] In the next game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Fitzpatrick completed 27 of 33 passes for 402 yards and four touchdowns, finishing with a 144.4 QB rating despite an interception (which was after a juggle his receiver made) as the Buccaneers won by a score of 27\u201321.[113] He earned his second consecutive NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[114] Fitzpatrick's unexpectedly incredible performance during the first two weeks of the season revived his \"Fitzmagic\" nickname. The following week against the Pittsburgh Steelers on *Monday Night Football*, Fitzpatrick finished with 411 passing yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions as the Buccaneers narrowly lost by a score of 30\u201327.[115] He became the first player in NFL history to throw for over 400 yards in three consecutive games.[116] During a Week 4 48\u201310 road loss to the Chicago Bears, Fitzpatrick's performance regressed as he only threw for 126 yards and an interception. Fitzpatrick was replaced by Winston, who had just been reinstated from a three-game suspension.[117]\n\n\nDuring a Week 8 37-34 road loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, Fitzpatrick relieved Winston at the end of the third quarter after Winston was benched after throwing for 276 yards, a touchdown, and four interceptions. Fitzpatrick completed 11 of 15 passes for 194 yards and two touchdowns to tie the game 34\u201334 with 1:05 left in the game after being down 34\u201316, but the Bengals would then drive down the field and kick a game-winning field goal as time expired.[118] The next day, the Buccaneers named Fitzpatrick their starting quarterback.[119] In the next game against the Carolina Panthers, he threw for 243 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions as the Buccaneers lost on the road by a score of 42-28.[120] The following week against the Washington Redskins, Fitzpatrick had his fourth 400-yard passing game of the season, throwing for 406 yards and two interceptions, which tied Dan Marino and Peyton Manning for the single-season record as the Buccaneers lost by a score of 16\u20133.[121] During a narrow Week 11 38\u201335 road loss to the New York Giants, Fitzpatrick was benched for Winston again in the second half after throwing for 167 yards and three interceptions in what would be his final appearance of the 2018 season.[122]\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished the 2018 season with 2,366 passing yards, 17 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, and a career-high passer rating of 100.4 to go along with 36 carries for 152 yards and two touchdowns in eight games and seven starts.[123]\n\n\n\n### Miami Dolphins[edit]\n\n\n#### 2019 season[edit]\n\n\nOn March 18, 2019, Fitzpatrick signed a two-year, $11 million contract with the Miami Dolphins.[124][125] He was named the Dolphins starting quarterback over Josh Rosen.[126]\n\n\nDuring the season-opening 59-10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Fitzpatrick threw for 185 yards, a touchdown, and an interception.[127] In the next game against the New England Patriots, he threw for 89 yards and was intercepted thrice, with two being pick-sixes, before being benched for Rosen in the 43\u20130 shutout loss.[128] After the game, Dolphins' head coach Brian Flores said that Fitzpatrick would still be the starter in Week 3 against the Dallas Cowboys,[129] but on September 19, prior to the game, Rosen was named the starter, sending Fitzpatrick to the bench.[130]\n\n\nDuring a narrow Week 6 17-16 loss to the Washington Redskins, Fitzpatrick relieved Rosen after the latter was benched for poor performance. Fitzpatrick threw for 132 yards and a touchdown. After leading Miami to a last-minute touchdown, he attempted a two-point conversion pass to Kenyan Drake, who dropped it, sealing the loss for Miami.[131] Fitzpatrick started the next game against the Buffalo Bills, his former team, leading the Dolphins to a 14\u20139 halftime lead. However, after he threw an interception to cornerback Tre'Davious White, the Bills rallied in the fourth quarter to win. Fitzpatrick finished the 31-21 road loss with 282 passing yards, a touchdown, and an interception to go along with six carries for 13 yards and a touchdown.[132] Two weeks later against another of his former teams, the New York Jets, Fitzpatrick threw for 288 yards and three touchdowns as the Dolphins won their first game of the season by a score of 26\u201318.[133] During a Week 13 37-31 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, he threw for 365 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception.[134] Three weeks later against the Cincinnati Bengals, Fitzpatrick threw for 419 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception as the Dolphins won by a score of 38\u201335 in overtime.[135] He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Bengals.[136] In the regular season finale against the Patriots, Fitzpatrick threw for 320 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 15 yards and a touchdown during the 27\u201324 road victory. The win denied the Patriots a first-round bye for the first time since 2009. He also played against Tom Brady in his final regular season game as a Patriot, as he would sign with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the offseason. Fitzpatrick is also the only quarterback to defeat Tom Brady with all the Patriots\u2019 division rivals.[137]\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished the 2019 season with 3,529 passing yards, 20 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions to go along with 54 carries for 243 yards and four touchdowns in 15 games and 13 starts.[138] He ended up being the team's leading rusher for the 2019 season.[139]\n\n\n\n#### 2020 season[edit]\n\n\nOn September 7, 2020, Fitzpatrick was confirmed to have won the Dolphins starting job for the second year in a row after beating out rookie quarterback Tua Tagovailoa in training camp.[140]\n\n\nDuring the season-opening 21-11 road loss against the New England Patriots, Fitzpatrick threw for 191 yards and three interceptions.[141] In the next game against the Buffalo Bills, he had 328 passing yards and two touchdowns as the Dolphins narrowly lost by a score of 31\u201328.[142] The following week against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Fitzpatrick threw for 160 yards and two touchdowns to go along with seven carries for 38 yards and a touchdown during the 31\u201313 victory. In doing so, he extended his NFL record for wins against a single opponent with different teams to six.[143] Fitzpatrick also joined Walter Payton as the only players since 1948 to finish with two passing touchdowns, a rushing touchdown, 20 rushing yards, and a reception in the same game.[144]\n\n\nDuring a Week 5 43-17 road victory over the San Francisco 49ers, Fitzpatrick threw for 350 yards and three touchdowns.[145] In the next game against one of his former teams, the New York Jets, Fitzpatrick threw for 191 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions during the 24\u20130 shutout victory.[146] Two days later on October 20, Brian Flores named Tagovailoa the team's starting quarter for the Week 8 matchup against the Los Angeles Rams following the bye week.[147]\n\n\nDuring a Week 11 20-13 road loss to the Denver Broncos, Fitzpatrick relieved Tagovailoa in the fourth quarter after he was benched for poor performance. During the game, Fitzpatrick threw for 117 yards and an interception.[148] Fitzpatrick was named the Dolphins' starting quarterback for the next game against the Jets after Tagovailoa jammed his thumb in practice.[149] During that game, Fitzpatrick threw for 257 yards and a touchdown in the 20\u20133 road victory.[150]\n\n\nDuring a narrow Week 16 26-25 road victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, Fitzpatrick was brought in to relieve Tagovailoa early in the fourth quarter after the latter was benched. Fitzpatrick led a game-winning drive where he found Mack Hollins for a 34-yard completion down while having his face mask pulled with 19 seconds left in the game and down 25\u201323 with no timeouts. The pass, coupled with the 15-yard face mask penalty, led to a game-winning field goal by Jason Sanders. Fitzpatrick finished the game throwing for 182 yards and a 59-yard touchdown to Myles Gaskin.[151][152] On December 31, 2020, Fitzpatrick was placed on the Dolphins' reserve/COVID-19 list.[153] Without Fitzpatrick available, the Dolphins lost their Week 17 rematch with the Bills on the road by a score of 56\u201326 with Tagovailoa at quarterback and were eliminated from postseason contention when the Indianapolis Colts won later that day.[154] Fitzpatrick was activated from the list on January 11, 2021.[155]\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished the 2020 season with 2,091 passing yards, 13 touchdowns, and eight interceptions to go along with 30 carries for 151 yards and two touchdowns in nine games and seven starts.[156]\n\n\n\n### Washington Football Team[edit]\n\n\nFitzpatrick signed a one-year contract with the Washington Football Team on March 18, 2021.[157]\n\n\nFitzpatrick started in the season-opening 20-16 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers but suffered a hip subluxation during the second quarter, which resulted in him being placed on injured reserve and missing the rest of the season.[158][159] Due to his brief tenure, Fitzpatrick did not throw any touchdowns or interceptions with Washington, the only time he did not do so with a team he played for.[160]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nOn June 2, 2022, Fitzpatrick announced his retirement from the NFL after 17 seasons.[161][162]\n\n\n\n## NFL career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Legend\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Led the league\n |\n| **Bold** | Career high\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | Games\n | Passing\n | Rushing\n | Sacks\n | Fumbles\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP | GS | Record | Cmp | Att | Pct | Yds | Y/A | Lng | TD | Int | Rtg | Att | Yds | Y/A | Lng | TD | Sck | Yds | Fum | Lost |\n| 2005 | STL | 4 | 3 | 0\u22123 | 76 | 135 | 56.3 | 777 | 5.8 | 56 | 4 | 8 | 58.2 | 14 | 64 | 4.6 | 14 | 2 | 9 | 49 | 3 | 1\n |\n| 2006 | STL | 1 | 0 | \u2014 | 0 | 0 | \u2014 | 0 | \u2014 | 0 | 0 | 0 | \u2014 | 3 | 0 | 0.0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2007 | CIN | 1 | 0 | \u2014 | 0 | 0 | \u2014 | 0 | \u2014 | 0 | 0 | 0 | \u2014 | 0 | 0 | \u2014 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2008 | CIN | 13 | 12 | 4\u22127\u22121 | 221 | 372 | 59.4 | 1,905 | 5.1 | 79 | 8 | 9 | 70.0 | **60** | **304** | 5.1 | 22 | 2 | 38 | 193 | **11** | 5\n |\n| 2009 | BUF | 10 | 8 | 4\u22124 | 127 | 227 | 55.9 | 1,422 | 6.3 | **98** | 9 | 10 | 69.7 | 31 | 141 | 4.5 | **31** | 1 | 21 | 127 | 3 | 2\n |\n| 2010 | BUF | 13 | 13 | 4\u22129 | 255 | 441 | 57.8 | 3,000 | 6.8 | 65 | 23 | 15 | 81.8 | 40 | 269 | **6.7** | 22 | 0 | 24 | 145 | 8 | 5\n |\n| 2011 | BUF | **16** | **16** | 6\u221210 | **353** | **569** | 62.0 | 3,832 | 6.7 | 60 | 24 | **23** | 79.1 | 56 | 215 | 3.8 | 18 | 0 | 22 | 148 | 7 | 2\n |\n| 2012 | BUF | **16** | **16** | 6\u221210 | 306 | 505 | 60.6 | 3,400 | 6.7 | 68 | 24 | 16 | 83.3 | 48 | 197 | 4.1 | 20 | 1 | 30 | 161 | 8 | **6** |\n| 2013 | TEN | 11 | 9 | 3\u22126 | 217 | 350 | 62.0 | 2,454 | 7.0 | 77 | 14 | 12 | 82.0 | 43 | 225 | 5.2 | 26 | 3 | 21 | 109 | 9 | 2\n |\n| 2014 | HOU | 12 | 12 | 6\u22126 | 197 | 312 | 63.1 | 2,483 | 8.0 | 76 | 17 | 8 | 95.3 | 50 | 184 | 3.7 | 16 | 2 | 21 | 83 | 5 | 1\n |\n| 2015 | NYJ | **16** | **16** | **10\u22126** | 335 | 562 | 59.6 | **3,905** | 6.9 | 69 | **31** | 15 | 88.0 | **60** | 270 | 4.5 | 19 | 2 | 19 | 94 | 5 | 2\n |\n| 2016 | NYJ | 14 | 11 | 3\u22128 | 228 | 403 | 56.6 | 2,710 | 6.7 | 57 | 12 | 17 | 69.6 | 33 | 130 | 3.9 | 14 | 0 | 19 | 81 | 9 | 1\n |\n| 2017 | TB | 6 | 3 | 2\u22121 | 96 | 163 | 58.9 | 1,103 | 6.8 | 41 | 7 | 3 | 86.0 | 15 | 78 | 5.2 | 15 | 0 | 7 | 34 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2018 | TB | 8 | 7 | 2\u22125 | 164 | 246 | 66.7 | 2,366 | **9.6** | 75 | 17 | 12 | **100.4** | 36 | 152 | 4.2 | 18 | 2 | 14 | 76 | 4 | 1\n |\n| 2019 | MIA | 15 | 13 | 5\u22128 | 311 | 502 | 62.0 | 3,529 | 7.0 | 51 | 20 | 13 | 85.5 | 54 | 243 | 4.5 | 20 | **4** | **40** | **209** | 9 | 2\n |\n| 2020 | MIA | 9 | 7 | 4\u22123 | 183 | 267 | **68.5** | 2,091 | 7.8 | 70 | 13 | 8 | 95.6 | 30 | 151 | 5.0 | 17 | 2 | 14 | 65 | 2 | 0\n |\n| 2021 | WAS | 1 | 1 | 0\u22121 | 3 | 6 | 50.0 | 13 | 2.2 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 56.2 | 1 | 2 | 2.0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 0\n |\n| Career | 166 | 147 | 59\u221287\u22121 | 3,072 | 5,060 | 60.7 | 34,990 | 6.9 | 98 | 223 | 169 | 82.3 | 575 | 2,623 | 4.6 | 31 | 21 | 300 | 1,576 | 84 | 30\n |\n\n\n### Career awards, highlights, and records[edit]\n\n\n* NFL Rookie of the Week (Week 12, 2005)\n* AFC Offensive Player of the Month (September 2011)[163]\n* 5\u00d7 AFC Offensive Player of the Week (Week 13, 2014;
