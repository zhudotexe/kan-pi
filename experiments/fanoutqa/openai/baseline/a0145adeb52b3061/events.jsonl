More than 13,000 homes and other infrastructure were damaged or destroyed. It was the largest earthquake to strike the province since 2017.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Tectonic setting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The tectonic overview of the Tibetan Plateau and Sichuan\nSichuan is situated in a complex zone of faulting created by the continued collision of the Indian Plate with the Eurasian Plate. As Himalayan underthrusting continues, the crust of the Eurasian Plate is deformed and uplifted to form the Tibetan Plateau. Instead of thrust faulting to its south, the Tibetan Plateau accommodates deformation through strike-slip escape tectonics. Large amounts of strike-slip motion are accommodated through major faults and their splays along the plateau, such as the Altyn Tagh Fault, Kunlun Fault, Haiyuan Fault, and Xianshuihe fault systems. Left-lateral strike-slip motion squeezes the crustal blocks of the Tibetan Plateau outwards, forcing it to move eastwards. Meanwhile, the strike-slip motion also results in an east-west extension of the plateau, causing normal faults to break within the thickened crust.[6][7]\n\n\nOn a continental scale, the seismicity of central and eastern Asia is broadly the result of the northward convergence of the Indian Plate against the Eurasian Plate. The convergence of the two plates is accommodated by the uplift of the Asian highlands and by the motion of crustal material to the east away from the uplifted Tibetan Plateau. In the past 20 years, 25 other earthquakes M5.0+ have occurred within 200 km (120 mi) of the 5 September 2022, event. Most of this seismicity is related to aftershocks of previous destructive earthquakes in the western margin of the Sichuan Basin. This event is southwest of a cluster of seismicity following an M6.6 earthquake on 20 April 2013 that resulted in 196 fatalities. An M7.9 earthquake on 12 May 2008 occurred near the September event and resulted in over 87,000 fatalities, making it one of the most destructive earthquakes in recent history.[3]\n\n\n\n## Earthquake[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A strong ground motion map by the USGS showing the varying levels of intensities felt across the region relative to the epicenter\nThe earthquake measured 6.8 on the surface-wave magnitude scale (Ms );[8] on the moment magnitude scale (Mw ), it measured 6.7.[1] According to the United States Geological Survey, the earthquake was a result of shallow strike-slip faulting on the western margin of the Sichuan Basin. The earthquake occurred on either an NNW–SSE striking, steep WSW dipping left-lateral fault, or a WSW–ENE striking, near vertical dipping right-lateral fault.[9] The location and sense of motion are consistent with movement on or near the left-lateral Xianshuihe fault system, which runs for 350 km (220 mi).[10] Many faults in this region are related to the convergence of crustal material slowly moving from the high Tibetan Plateau to the west, against the strong crust underlying the Sichuan Basin and southeastern China.[3]\n\n\nExperts from the Sichuan Earthquake Administration said the earthquake occurred near the Moxi Fault, a segment of the southeastern Xianshuihe fault zone.[11] They added that it is unlikely that a larger earthquake will occur near the epicenter, but aftershocks would persist.[12] The Xianshuihe fault zone is a large active left-lateral fault that defines the margin between the Bayan Har and the Sichuan-Yunnan blocks. It produced destructive earthquakes in 1786 (M7.75), 1816 (M7.5), 1850 (7.5), 1893 (M7.0), 1904 (M7.0), 1923 (M7.3), 1948 (7.3), 1955 (M7.5), 1973 (M7.6), 1981 (M6.9) and 2014 (M6.3). No M7.0+ earthquakes have been recorded along the Moxi Fault since 1786. It runs north–south between Kangding and Shimian. The fault was considered a potential source for large earthquakes due to the absence of any since 1786.[13]\n\n\nA 45 km (28 mi) length along a NNW–SSE striking fault corresponded to the rupture with a maximum slip of 1.02 m (3 ft 4 in).[14] Most of the seismic moment was released within the first 10 seconds of the rupture initiating, which then propagated to the southwest. At least 2,715 aftershocks were recorded until 12 September,[15] at depths of 5–15 km (3.1–9.3 mi) and distributed along a north–northwest trend.[16] On 22 October, a Mww  5.3 aftershock was recorded near Moxi Town.[17] It had an epicenter 5 km (3.1 mi) away from the mainshock. By 22 October, 6,486 aftershocks had been recorded.[18] A Mww  5.5 aftershock occurred with an epicenter 8 km (5.0 mi) from that of the mainshock's on 26 January.[19][20]\n\n\nUsing broadband seismic networks, the total rupture duration was calculated at 16 seconds, releasing 4.1×1014 J of energy. An energy magnitude (Me) of 6.8 was determined. As the Me  value is larger than Mw  (6.7), the earthquake likely released seismic energy in an efficient manner. It may have resulted in more extreme ground shaking compared to earthquakes with similar Mw  values.[21]\n\n\n\n### Strong ground motion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Spectral acceleration\n\nStrong ground motion data was recorded at four accelerographs at Hailuogou, Moxi Town, Detuo and Yanzigou. Three accelerographs, namely those in Hailuogou, Moxi Town and Detuo, contributed to the earthquake early warning. The Hailuogou accelerograph which was nearest to the epicenter recorded the highest peak ground acceleration (pga)—0.68 *g* in the north–south component. The pga values at Hailuogou, Moxi Town and Detuo slightly exceeded the limit considered for earthquakes in the area. In addition, the highest peak ground velocity (pgv) was 61.2 cm (24.1 in)/s in the east–west component, recorded at Moxi Town. The vertical component pgv was at the town 44.9 cm (17.7 in)/s.[2]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Damage to a building's facade\nThe earthquake struck Sichuan province while its COVID-19 lockdown was in effect. It followed a drought and heat wave which had affected water and power supplies due to the province's dependency on hydropower. Two earthquakes in June caused at least four deaths.[22]\n\n\n\n### Casualties[edit]\n\n\nAt least 93 people were killed,[23] and 424 were injured.[24] A further 24 people remain missing, nine in Luding County and 16 in Shimian County.[25] Provincial officials reported 55 fatalities and 264 injuries in Ganzi Prefecture.[25][24] Three park employees of Hailuogou National Geological Park[26][27] were among the dead.[28] The Alpine Ecosystem Observation and Experiment Station of Gongga Mountain, a research facility, partially collapsed,[29] killing a graduate student, and injuring three.[30] Most of the casualties were attributed to collapsing homes while some were buried by landslides as they walked on roads.[31] Some received minor injuries due to rockfalls.[32] Eight people from the county received medical attention at West China Medical Center in Chengdu.[33]\n\n\nA further 38 people in Shimian County (Ya'an Prefecture) died and 158 were injured;[25][24] including six fatalities and 11 injuries reported in Caoke; 24 fatalities and 27 injured in Wanggangping;[34] seven fatalities and another seven injured in Xinmin. At Xinmian, 33 were injured.[35] Five people were injured in Hanyuan County.[34] One person was also injured in Liangshan Prefecture.[24] The injured were treated at a hospital.[36] Seventeen days after the earthquake, an injured survivor was located by a resident and rescued.[37]\n\n\n\n### Damage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Building damaged in Moxi Town\nA preliminary evaluation of damage revealed 243 homes collapsed and a further 13,010 were damaged. Two pieces of public infrastructure were destroyed and 142 were damaged. The earthquake also destroyed four hotels and damaged an additional 307. Slope failures caused roads to collapse. Seven small to medium-sized hydropower stations were heavily damaged. Water supply systems were also affected.[38] Many towns and villages were damaged to varying extents.[28] Preliminary reports indicate communication services were down in the towns of Moxi and Yanzigou. At Detuo, landslides severely damaged many homes. Roads were damaged at Lengmoan.[39] Roads were badly damaged so rescuers had to reach the town by boats.[33]\n\n\nSatellite imagery and a field investigation revealed 4,528 earthquake-triggered landslides over a 2,000 km2 (770 sq mi) area. The total area of landslides was 28.1 km2 (10.8 sq mi).[40] In Luding County, a section of Sichuan Provincial Highway 211 was buried under a landslide while another was obstructed by rockfalls. These roads were cleared by officials immediately.[41] Although there was no damage to dams and hydropower facilities,[5] damaged powerlines affected 43,158 customers.[42] About 55 km (34 mi) of optical cables and 289 communication stations were damaged, interrupting communication systems to 35,000 homes.[42] Nine electrical substations remained out of operation and three were damaged. At least 57 electric transmission cables tripped.[43] More than 200 people were trapped at Hailuogou National Geological Park.[44] Thousands were trapped when a landslide blocked the confluence of the Dadu and Wandong rivers, forming a lake.[45] Residents living downstream were evacuated.[46] On the morning of 6 September, the lake overflowed, discharging water at a rate of 150–200 m3 (5,300–7,100 cu ft)/s. Twelve hours later, the rate decreased to 10–15 m3 (350–530 cu ft)/s.[47]\n\n\nThe earthquake-produced shaking assigned a maximum seismic intensity (CSIS) of IX over the mountainous northwestern region of the province. It was felt in the towns of Moxi, Yanzigou and Dewei in Luding County for 280 km2 (110 sq mi). The maximum CSIS felt in Ya'an Prefecture was VII.[48] CSIS VI was felt over a 14,696 km2 (5,674 sq mi) area by 580,000 people.[49] The earthquake was felt several hundred kilometers away in Changsha, Hunan province, and Xi'an, Shaanxi province.[50] Shaking in Luding was reportedly so intense that people faced difficulties trying to remain standing.[51]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| CSIS in selected locations[49] |\n| CSIS | city/county | Location\n |\n| IX\n | Luding County, Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture\n | Moxi, Detuo, Yanzigou, Dewei\n |\n| Shimian County, Ya'an\n | Wanggangping Yizu Zangzu Township, Caoke Tibetan Township, Xinmin Tibetan Yi Township\n |\n| VIII\n | Luding County, Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture\n | Moxi, Yanzigou, Deto, Dewei\n |\n| Shimian County, Ya'an\n | Wanggangping Yizu Zangzu Township, Caoke Tibetan Township, Xinmin Tibetan Yi Township\n |\n| VII\n | Luding County, Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture\n | Yanzigou, Luqiao, Dewei Town, Moxi, Lengqi, Xinglong, Deto, Pengba |\n| Kangding, Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture\n | Yulin, Gonggashanxiang\n |\n| Jiulong County, Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture\n | Hongbaxiang, Wanbaxiang\n |\n| Shimian County, Ya'an\n | Caoke Tibetan Township, Xieluoxiang, Anshunxiang, Wanggangping Yizu Zangzu Township, Fengle Township, Xinmian Street, Yingzheng Township, Meiluo, Xinmin Tibetan Yi Township, Yonghe Township\n |\n| Hanyuan County, Ya'an\n | Yidong Town, Fuxiang Township, Qianyu Town\n |\n| Yingjing County, Ya'an\n | Niubeishan |\n| Tianquan County, Ya'an\n | Louhe\n |\n\n\n## Response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Emergency workers rescuing injured villagers in Moxi, Luding County\nAn earthquake early warning was activated four seconds after the mainshock was initiated. Residents in Kangding, 53 km (33 mi) away, were given seven seconds of warning before shaking occurred. At Ya'an and Chengdu, 20 seconds and 50 seconds of warning were given, respectively. These warnings were broadcast through loudspeakers, mobile phones, and televisions.[52] Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, asked local officials to \"make saving lives the first priority, go all out to rescue people in disaster-stricken areas and minimise loss of life\". Li Keqiang, the Premier of the State Council, urged a \"swift evaluation of the situation, as well as all-out rescue and medical treatment efforts\".[53]\n\n\n\n### Emergency response[edit]\n\n\nEmergency management officials from Luding County were dispatched to verify casualties and evaluate the damage.[54] Officials prevented vehicle entry into China National Highway 318 to ensure rescue roadways were unblocked.[55] Railway services including C6633, D1919, and G8792, operated by the China Railway Chengdu Group, were delayed for damage inspections. Affected passengers were refunded.[56]\n\n\nThe Ministry of Emergency Management and the National Committee for Disaster Reduction issued a *Level IV* emergency response to the area. More than 6,500 emergency rescue personnel from Ganzi, Chengdu, Deyang, Leshan, Ya'an, Meishan, and Ziyang were dispatched to the epicenter.[57][58] In addition, 370 fire trucks and construction vehicles, nine rescue helicopters, three drones, and 31 rescue equipment were deployed.[59]\n\n\nIn Moxi, personnel from the Sichuan Forest Fire Brigade rescued trapped residents from the rubble and transported the injured over a river.[60] At least 50 people who were injured received treatment by medical teams. Emergency personnel pulled over 30 people trapped beneath debris. Rescuers had to dig through the debris by hand as rescue equipment was unable to pass through narrow passageways.[57]\n\n\nRescuers pulled three survivors and one body from the rubble of a collapsed hotel in Moxi.[61] Rescuers also located survivors trapped beneath a collapsed bridge in Detuo.[62] All 219 people previously trapped for over 50 hours at Hailuogou National Geological Park were successfully evacuated to Moxi via helicopter.[63][64]\n\n\n\n![](image)Landslides which dammed part of a river\nFirefighters used rubber boats to reach affected villages. At Ziyachang and Wandong villages, 17 people were evacuated. Firefighters were also observing the dammed lake and warned residents to evacuate.[45] Rescuers evacuated over 900 residents in Qinggangping, a village near Moxi which was threatened by rapid-flowing water.[65] Local authorities were concerned over the possibility of more landslides forming pools of water in rivers elsewhere.[66] Officials said that the extent of damage on the Dadu River remains unknown but was being monitored.[67] The river was later discharged but the affected residents had already evacuated.[47]\n\n\nWet weather conditions and mudflows have disrupted rescuers' attempts to search for the missing. China's meteorological administration issued a yellow alert warning of the possibility of \"geological disasters\". Heavy downpours were expected in some areas while moderate precipitation was forecasted for several days. The administration added that \"post-earthquake geological conditions are inherently fragile, and the impact of additional rainfall may lead to landslides and mudslides\". Aftershocks triggered additional landslides.[68]\n\n\n\n### Relief efforts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Temporary shelters to house affected residents\nOn 5 September, the Chinese government reserved 50 million yuan (7,250,000 USD) for relief efforts.[57] An additional 150 million yuan (21,602,010 USD) was provided on 9 September.[69] Officials of Sichuan also allocated 50 million yuan to Ganzi.[57] The Red Cross Society of China provided 1 million yuan (143,000 USD), 450 tents, 3,000 relief packages, 2,400 beds, and 1,200 blankets. In addition, more than 150 members of the organization responded to the crisis.[70] Donations from 65 businesses to assist in recovery efforts totaled 1.168 billion yuan (167,435,988 USD), according to SASAC.[71] Wuliangye donated 15 million yuan (2,200,000 USD) while BYD donated 5 million yuan (718,000 USD).[72][73]\n\n\nOver 3,600 people and 70 search and rescue dogs from Chongqing, Gansu, Guizhou, Yunnan, Qinghai, and other nearby regions were put on standby for possible interregional efforts. The State Reserve Bureau and Ministry of Emergency Management allocated 3,000 tents, 10,000 quilts, 10,000 beds, and other relief supplies to relocate residents of Luding County.[74] More than 50,000 residents in Ganzi and Ya'an were evacuated,[57] and 22,000 were relocated across 124 makeshift settlements.[75]\n\n\nRoads giving way to the epicenter region had reopened, allowing traffic to resume by 7 September.[76] Officials in Luding County said that its lithium battery factories were unaffected. Most commercial and industrial operations had resumed.[43] The China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda said that all four panda facilities across the province were unaffected.[77] PetroChina operated three gas stations at its facilities in Kangding and Ganzi to ensure its supply for disaster relief. Trucks were also utilized to mobilize oil to the region.[78] By 8 September, power was restored to 34,184 households or about 80 percent of Ganzi and Ya'an prefectures.[79] China Tower said that 211 of its 398 mobile communication facilities lost power while two were out of service. In response, 138 repair specialists, 59 vehicles, and 116 generators were dispatched to the area.[80]\n\n\nTaiwan's fire department said that 40 rescuers, a search dog, and five tonnes of equipment were on standby if assistance was needed.[81] CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, said that the company pledged to donate to relief efforts, although the amount of money was not disclosed.[82]\n\n\n\n## COVID-19 response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An announcement by the officials of Ganzi Prefecture in response to COVID-19\nWhen the earthquake struck, residents in Chengdu who attempted to flee their homes found the exits to these buildings locked. Under China's Zero-COVID response and stringent lockdown rules, apartment blocks were locked to keep residents indoors.[83] Videos of these incidents, where frightened residents were locked from inside their apartments, circulated online and sparked anger among netizens. In response, the Chengdu Health Commission said \"priority should be given to safeguarding the lives of the public in the event of earthquakes, fires, floods and other disasters\".[84]\n\n\nThe Ganzi Prefecture Emergency Command for the New Coronary Pneumonia Epidemic issued a statement on WeChat to prevent a local epidemic in the disaster-stricken area. The statement stated that rescue workers were required to present a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 24 hours and a green health code. Rescuers also had to make sure they did not travel to cities with COVID-19 cases. Rescue workers would have to undergo an inspection at checkpoints before carrying out rescue missions.[85] Authorities placed the affected area under temporary restrictions, prohibiting the public from entering. Survivors were regularly tested for COVID-19 every day and had to disclose their travel history by logging their location on a mobile app. Residents of the area also needed to present approval documents to local authorities before entering.[86]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Excavators clearing landslide debris along a road in Moxi\nMemorial services were held on 12 September, at 12:52 in Sichuan in remembrance of the earthquake victims. Air raid sirens and vehicle horns sounded as part of the mourning ceremony. Government officials, personnel from the People's Liberation Army, rescue personnel, and members of the public brought flowers to commemorate the victims. Politicians including Wang Xiaohui and Sichuan's governor Huang Qiang were present during the service.[87][88] Psychological assistance was provided for survivors.[89]\n\n\nBy 13 September, electricity and communication services had returned. Officials also reduced the emergency level in the affected area.[90] More than 10,000 students unable to return to school received lessons via online classes.[91] All classes were resumed on 14 September, some lessons were conducted at off-campus locations.[92]\n\n\nThe Mww  5.3 aftershock on 22 October triggered significant rockfalls and damaged homes in Moxi Town. The Sichuan Forest Fire Brigade was deployed to respond to the aftershock.[93]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Earth sciences portal\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n\n\n* List of earthquakes in 2022\n* List of earthquakes in China\n* List of earthquakes in Sichuan\n* Geology of China\n* Geology of the Himalayas\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** *Global CMT Catalog Search* (Data set), Global Centroid Moment Tensor, 5 September 2022, archived from the original on 6 September 2022, retrieved 6 September 2022\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Qu, Zhe; Zhu, Bai-Jie; Cao, Yu-Teng; Fu, Hao-Ran (2022). \"Rapid report of seismic damage to buildings in the 2022 M6.8 Luding earthquake, China\". *Earthquake Research Advances*. **3**: 100180. doi:10.1016/j.eqrea.2022.100180.

More than 13,000 homes and other infrastructure were damaged or destroyed. It was the largest earthquake to strike the province since 2017.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Tectonic setting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The tectonic overview of the Tibetan Plateau and Sichuan\nSichuan is situated in a complex zone of faulting created by the continued collision of the Indian Plate with the Eurasian Plate. As Himalayan underthrusting continues, the crust of the Eurasian Plate is deformed and uplifted to form the Tibetan Plateau. Instead of thrust faulting to its south, the Tibetan Plateau accommodates deformation through strike-slip escape tectonics. Large amounts of strike-slip motion are accommodated through major faults and their splays along the plateau, such as the Altyn Tagh Fault, Kunlun Fault, Haiyuan Fault, and Xianshuihe fault systems. Left-lateral strike-slip motion squeezes the crustal blocks of the Tibetan Plateau outwards, forcing it to move eastwards. Meanwhile, the strike-slip motion also results in an east-west extension of the plateau, causing normal faults to break within the thickened crust.[6][7]\n\n\nOn a continental scale, the seismicity of central and eastern Asia is broadly the result of the northward convergence of the Indian Plate against the Eurasian Plate. The convergence of the two plates is accommodated by the uplift of the Asian highlands and by the motion of crustal material to the east away from the uplifted Tibetan Plateau. In the past 20 years, 25 other earthquakes M5.0+ have occurred within 200 km (120 mi) of the 5 September 2022, event. Most of this seismicity is related to aftershocks of previous destructive earthquakes in the western margin of the Sichuan Basin. This event is southwest of a cluster of seismicity following an M6.6 earthquake on 20 April 2013 that resulted in 196 fatalities. An M7.9 earthquake on 12 May 2008 occurred near the September event and resulted in over 87,000 fatalities, making it one of the most destructive earthquakes in recent history.[3]\n\n\n\n## Earthquake[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A strong ground motion map by the USGS showing the varying levels of intensities felt across the region relative to the epicenter\nThe earthquake measured 6.8 on the surface-wave magnitude scale (Ms );[8] on the moment magnitude scale (Mw ), it measured 6.7.[1] According to the United States Geological Survey, the earthquake was a result of shallow strike-slip faulting on the western margin of the Sichuan Basin. The earthquake occurred on either an NNW–SSE striking, steep WSW dipping left-lateral fault, or a WSW–ENE striking, near vertical dipping right-lateral fault.[9] The location and sense of motion are consistent with movement on or near the left-lateral Xianshuihe fault system, which runs for 350 km (220 mi).[10] Many faults in this region are related to the convergence of crustal material slowly moving from the high Tibetan Plateau to the west, against the strong crust underlying the Sichuan Basin and southeastern China.[3]\n\n\nExperts from the Sichuan Earthquake Administration said the earthquake occurred near the Moxi Fault, a segment of the southeastern Xianshuihe fault zone.[11] They added that it is unlikely that a larger earthquake will occur near the epicenter, but aftershocks would persist.[12] The Xianshuihe fault zone is a large active left-lateral fault that defines the margin between the Bayan Har and the Sichuan-Yunnan blocks. It produced destructive earthquakes in 1786 (M7.75), 1816 (M7.5), 1850 (7.5), 1893 (M7.0), 1904 (M7.0), 1923 (M7.3), 1948 (7.3), 1955 (M7.5), 1973 (M7.6), 1981 (M6.9) and 2014 (M6.3). No M7.0+ earthquakes have been recorded along the Moxi Fault since 1786. It runs north–south between Kangding and Shimian. The fault was considered a potential source for large earthquakes due to the absence of any since 1786.[13]\n\n\nA 45 km (28 mi) length along a NNW–SSE striking fault corresponded to the rupture with a maximum slip of 1.02 m (3 ft 4 in).[14] Most of the seismic moment was released within the first 10 seconds of the rupture initiating, which then propagated to the southwest. At least 2,715 aftershocks were recorded until 12 September,[15] at depths of 5–15 km (3.1–9.3 mi) and distributed along a north–northwest trend.[16] On 22 October, a Mww  5.3 aftershock was recorded near Moxi Town.[17] It had an epicenter 5 km (3.1 mi) away from the mainshock. By 22 October, 6,486 aftershocks had been recorded.[18] A Mww  5.5 aftershock occurred with an epicenter 8 km (5.0 mi) from that of the mainshock's on 26 January.[19][20]\n\n\nUsing broadband seismic networks, the total rupture duration was calculated at 16 seconds, releasing 4.1×1014 J of energy. An energy magnitude (Me) of 6.8 was determined. As the Me  value is larger than Mw  (6.7), the earthquake likely released seismic energy in an efficient manner. It may have resulted in more extreme ground shaking compared to earthquakes with similar Mw  values.[21]\n\n\n\n### Strong ground motion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Spectral acceleration\n\nStrong ground motion data was recorded at four accelerographs at Hailuogou, Moxi Town, Detuo and Yanzigou. Three accelerographs, namely those in Hailuogou, Moxi Town and Detuo, contributed to the earthquake early warning. The Hailuogou accelerograph which was nearest to the epicenter recorded the highest peak ground acceleration (pga)—0.68 *g* in the north–south component. The pga values at Hailuogou, Moxi Town and Detuo slightly exceeded the limit considered for earthquakes in the area. In addition, the highest peak ground velocity (pgv) was 61.2 cm (24.1 in)/s in the east–west component, recorded at Moxi Town. The vertical component pgv was at the town 44.9 cm (17.7 in)/s.[2]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Damage to a building's facade\nThe earthquake struck Sichuan province while its COVID-19 lockdown was in effect. It followed a drought and heat wave which had affected water and power supplies due to the province's dependency on hydropower. Two earthquakes in June caused at least four deaths.[22]\n\n\n\n### Casualties[edit]\n\n\nAt least 93 people were killed,[23] and 424 were injured.[24] A further 24 people remain missing, nine in Luding County and 16 in Shimian County.[25] Provincial officials reported 55 fatalities and 264 injuries in Ganzi Prefecture.[25][24] Three park employees of Hailuogou National Geological Park[26][27] were among the dead.[28] The Alpine Ecosystem Observation and Experiment Station of Gongga Mountain, a research facility, partially collapsed,[29] killing a graduate student, and injuring three.[30] Most of the casualties were attributed to collapsing homes while some were buried by landslides as they walked on roads.[31] Some received minor injuries due to rockfalls.[32] Eight people from the county received medical attention at West China Medical Center in Chengdu.[33]\n\n\nA further 38 people in Shimian County (Ya'an Prefecture) died and 158 were injured;[25][24] including six fatalities and 11 injuries reported in Caoke; 24 fatalities and 27 injured in Wanggangping;[34] seven fatalities and another seven injured in Xinmin. At Xinmian, 33 were injured.[35] Five people were injured in Hanyuan County.[34] One person was also injured in Liangshan Prefecture.[24] The injured were treated at a hospital.[36] Seventeen days after the earthquake, an injured survivor was located by a resident and rescued.[37]\n\n\n\n### Damage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Building damaged in Moxi Town\nA preliminary evaluation of damage revealed 243 homes collapsed and a further 13,010 were damaged. Two pieces of public infrastructure were destroyed and 142 were damaged. The earthquake also destroyed four hotels and damaged an additional 307. Slope failures caused roads to collapse. Seven small to medium-sized hydropower stations were heavily damaged. Water supply systems were also affected.[38] Many towns and villages were damaged to varying extents.[28] Preliminary reports indicate communication services were down in the towns of Moxi and Yanzigou. At Detuo, landslides severely damaged many homes. Roads were damaged at Lengmoan.[39] Roads were badly damaged so rescuers had to reach the town by boats.[33]\n\n\nSatellite imagery and a field investigation revealed 4,528 earthquake-triggered landslides over a 2,000 km2 (770 sq mi) area. The total area of landslides was 28.1 km2 (10.8 sq mi).[40] In Luding County, a section of Sichuan Provincial Highway 211 was buried under a landslide while another was obstructed by rockfalls. These roads were cleared by officials immediately.[41] Although there was no damage to dams and hydropower facilities,[5] damaged powerlines affected 43,158 customers.[42] About 55 km (34 mi) of optical cables and 289 communication stations were damaged, interrupting communication systems to 35,000 homes.[42] Nine electrical substations remained out of operation and three were damaged. At least 57 electric transmission cables tripped.[43] More than 200 people were trapped at Hailuogou National Geological Park.[44] Thousands were trapped when a landslide blocked the confluence of the Dadu and Wandong rivers, forming a lake.[45] Residents living downstream were evacuated.[46] On the morning of 6 September, the lake overflowed, discharging water at a rate of 150–200 m3 (5,300–7,100 cu ft)/s. Twelve hours later, the rate decreased to 10–15 m3 (350–530 cu ft)/s.[47]\n\n\nThe earthquake-produced shaking assigned a maximum seismic intensity (CSIS) of IX over the mountainous northwestern region of the province. It was felt in the towns of Moxi, Yanzigou and Dewei in Luding County for 280 km2 (110 sq mi). The maximum CSIS felt in Ya'an Prefecture was VII.[48] CSIS VI was felt over a 14,696 km2 (5,674 sq mi) area by 580,000 people.[49] The earthquake was felt several hundred kilometers away in Changsha, Hunan province, and Xi'an, Shaanxi province.[50] Shaking in Luding was reportedly so intense that people faced difficulties trying to remain standing.[51]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| CSIS in selected locations[49] |\n| CSIS | city/county | Location\n |\n| IX\n | Luding County, Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture\n | Moxi, Detuo, Yanzigou, Dewei\n |\n| Shimian County, Ya'an\n | Wanggangping Yizu Zangzu Township, Caoke Tibetan Township, Xinmin Tibetan Yi Township\n |\n| VIII\n | Luding County, Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture\n | Moxi, Yanzigou, Deto, Dewei\n |\n| Shimian County, Ya'an\n | Wanggangping Yizu Zangzu Township, Caoke Tibetan Township, Xinmin Tibetan Yi Township\n |\n| VII\n | Luding County, Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture\n | Yanzigou, Luqiao, Dewei Town, Moxi, Lengqi, Xinglong, Deto, Pengba |\n| Kangding, Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture\n | Yulin, Gonggashanxiang\n |\n| Jiulong County, Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture\n | Hongbaxiang, Wanbaxiang\n |\n| Shimian County, Ya'an\n | Caoke Tibetan Township, Xieluoxiang, Anshunxiang, Wanggangping Yizu Zangzu Township, Fengle Township, Xinmian Street, Yingzheng Township, Meiluo, Xinmin Tibetan Yi Township, Yonghe Township\n |\n| Hanyuan County, Ya'an\n | Yidong Town, Fuxiang Township, Qianyu Town\n |\n| Yingjing County, Ya'an\n | Niubeishan |\n| Tianquan County, Ya'an\n | Louhe\n |\n\n\n## Response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Emergency workers rescuing injured villagers in Moxi, Luding County\nAn earthquake early warning was activated four seconds after the mainshock was initiated. Residents in Kangding, 53 km (33 mi) away, were given seven seconds of warning before shaking occurred. At Ya'an and Chengdu, 20 seconds and 50 seconds of warning were given, respectively. These warnings were broadcast through loudspeakers, mobile phones, and televisions.[52] Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, asked local officials to \"make saving lives the first priority, go all out to rescue people in disaster-stricken areas and minimise loss of life\". Li Keqiang, the Premier of the State Council, urged a \"swift evaluation of the situation, as well as all-out rescue and medical treatment efforts\".[53]\n\n\n\n### Emergency response[edit]\n\n\nEmergency management officials from Luding County were dispatched to verify casualties and evaluate the damage.[54] Officials prevented vehicle entry into China National Highway 318 to ensure rescue roadways were unblocked.[55] Railway services including C6633, D1919, and G8792, operated by the China Railway Chengdu Group, were delayed for damage inspections. Affected passengers were refunded.[56]\n\n\nThe Ministry of Emergency Management and the National Committee for Disaster Reduction issued a *Level IV* emergency response to the area. More than 6,500 emergency rescue personnel from Ganzi, Chengdu, Deyang, Leshan, Ya'an, Meishan, and Ziyang were dispatched to the epicenter.[57][58] In addition, 370 fire trucks and construction vehicles, nine rescue helicopters, three drones, and 31 rescue equipment were deployed.[59]\n\n\nIn Moxi, personnel from the Sichuan Forest Fire Brigade rescued trapped residents from the rubble and transported the injured over a river.[60] At least 50 people who were injured received treatment by medical teams. Emergency personnel pulled over 30 people trapped beneath debris. Rescuers had to dig through the debris by hand as rescue equipment was unable to pass through narrow passageways.[57]\n\n\nRescuers pulled three survivors and one body from the rubble of a collapsed hotel in Moxi.[61] Rescuers also located survivors trapped beneath a collapsed bridge in Detuo.[62] All 219 people previously trapped for over 50 hours at Hailuogou National Geological Park were successfully evacuated to Moxi via helicopter.[63][64]\n\n\n\n![](image)Landslides which dammed part of a river\nFirefighters used rubber boats to reach affected villages. At Ziyachang and Wandong villages, 17 people were evacuated. Firefighters were also observing the dammed lake and warned residents to evacuate.[45] Rescuers evacuated over 900 residents in Qinggangping, a village near Moxi which was threatened by rapid-flowing water.[65] Local authorities were concerned over the possibility of more landslides forming pools of water in rivers elsewhere.[66] Officials said that the extent of damage on the Dadu River remains unknown but was being monitored.[67] The river was later discharged but the affected residents had already evacuated.[47]\n\n\nWet weather conditions and mudflows have disrupted rescuers' attempts to search for the missing. China's meteorological administration issued a yellow alert warning of the possibility of \"geological disasters\". Heavy downpours were expected in some areas while moderate precipitation was forecasted for several days. The administration added that \"post-earthquake geological conditions are inherently fragile, and the impact of additional rainfall may lead to landslides and mudslides\". Aftershocks triggered additional landslides.[68]\n\n\n\n### Relief efforts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Temporary shelters to house affected residents\nOn 5 September, the Chinese government reserved 50 million yuan (7,250,000 USD) for relief efforts.[57] An additional 150 million yuan (21,602,010 USD) was provided on 9 September.[69] Officials of Sichuan also allocated 50 million yuan to Ganzi.[57] The Red Cross Society of China provided 1 million yuan (143,000 USD), 450 tents, 3,000 relief packages, 2,400 beds, and 1,200 blankets. In addition, more than 150 members of the organization responded to the crisis.[70] Donations from 65 businesses to assist in recovery efforts totaled 1.168 billion yuan (167,435,988 USD), according to SASAC.[71] Wuliangye donated 15 million yuan (2,200,000 USD) while BYD donated 5 million yuan (718,000 USD).[72][73]\n\n\nOver 3,600 people and 70 search and rescue dogs from Chongqing, Gansu, Guizhou, Yunnan, Qinghai, and other nearby regions were put on standby for possible interregional efforts. The State Reserve Bureau and Ministry of Emergency Management allocated 3,000 tents, 10,000 quilts, 10,000 beds, and other relief supplies to relocate residents of Luding County.[74] More than 50,000 residents in Ganzi and Ya'an were evacuated,[57] and 22,000 were relocated across 124 makeshift settlements.[75]\n\n\nRoads giving way to the epicenter region had reopened, allowing traffic to resume by 7 September.[76] Officials in Luding County said that its lithium battery factories were unaffected. Most commercial and industrial operations had resumed.[43] The China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda said that all four panda facilities across the province were unaffected.[77] PetroChina operated three gas stations at its facilities in Kangding and Ganzi to ensure its supply for disaster relief. Trucks were also utilized to mobilize oil to the region.[78] By 8 September, power was restored to 34,184 households or about 80 percent of Ganzi and Ya'an prefectures.[79] China Tower said that 211 of its 398 mobile communication facilities lost power while two were out of service. In response, 138 repair specialists, 59 vehicles, and 116 generators were dispatched to the area.[80]\n\n\nTaiwan's fire department said that 40 rescuers, a search dog, and five tonnes of equipment were on standby if assistance was needed.[81] CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, said that the company pledged to donate to relief efforts, although the amount of money was not disclosed.[82]\n\n\n\n## COVID-19 response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An announcement by the officials of Ganzi Prefecture in response to COVID-19\nWhen the earthquake struck, residents in Chengdu who attempted to flee their homes found the exits to these buildings locked. Under China's Zero-COVID response and stringent lockdown rules, apartment blocks were locked to keep residents indoors.[83] Videos of these incidents, where frightened residents were locked from inside their apartments, circulated online and sparked anger among netizens. In response, the Chengdu Health Commission said \"priority should be given to safeguarding the lives of the public in the event of earthquakes, fires, floods and other disasters\".[84]\n\n\nThe Ganzi Prefecture Emergency Command for the New Coronary Pneumonia Epidemic issued a statement on WeChat to prevent a local epidemic in the disaster-stricken area. The statement stated that rescue workers were required to present a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 24 hours and a green health code. Rescuers also had to make sure they did not travel to cities with COVID-19 cases. Rescue workers would have to undergo an inspection at checkpoints before carrying out rescue missions.[85] Authorities placed the affected area under temporary restrictions, prohibiting the public from entering. Survivors were regularly tested for COVID-19 every day and had to disclose their travel history by logging their location on a mobile app. Residents of the area also needed to present approval documents to local authorities before entering.[86]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Excavators clearing landslide debris along a road in Moxi\nMemorial services were held on 12 September, at 12:52 in Sichuan in remembrance of the earthquake victims. Air raid sirens and vehicle horns sounded as part of the mourning ceremony. Government officials, personnel from the People's Liberation Army, rescue personnel, and members of the public brought flowers to commemorate the victims. Politicians including Wang Xiaohui and Sichuan's governor Huang Qiang were present during the service.[87][88] Psychological assistance was provided for survivors.[89]\n\n\nBy 13 September, electricity and communication services had returned. Officials also reduced the emergency level in the affected area.[90] More than 10,000 students unable to return to school received lessons via online classes.[91] All classes were resumed on 14 September, some lessons were conducted at off-campus locations.[92]\n\n\nThe Mww  5.3 aftershock on 22 October triggered significant rockfalls and damaged homes in Moxi Town. The Sichuan Forest Fire Brigade was deployed to respond to the aftershock.[93]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Earth sciences portal\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n\n\n* List of earthquakes in 2022\n* List of earthquakes in China\n* List of earthquakes in Sichuan\n* Geology of China\n* Geology of the Himalayas\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** *Global CMT Catalog Search* (Data set), Global Centroid Moment Tensor, 5 September 2022, archived from the original on 6 September 2022, retrieved 6 September 2022\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Qu, Zhe; Zhu, Bai-Jie; Cao, Yu-Teng; Fu, Hao-Ran (2022). \"Rapid report of seismic damage to buildings in the 2022 M6.8 Luding earthquake, China\". *Earthquake Research Advances*. **3**: 100180. doi:10.1016/j.eqrea.2022.100180.

Run-up of 67 m (220 ft) at Shoup Bay, Alaska. |\n| Casualties | 131 killed |\n\n\nThe **1964 Alaskan earthquake**, also known as the **Great Alaskan earthquake** and **Good Friday earthquake**, occurred at 5:36 pm AKST on Good Friday, March 27.[3] Across south-central Alaska, ground fissures, collapsing structures, and tsunamis resulting from the earthquake caused about 131 deaths.[4]\n\n\nLasting four minutes and thirty-eight seconds, the magnitude 9.2 megathrust earthquake remains the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in North America, and the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the world since modern seismography began in 1900. Six hundred miles (970 km) of fault ruptured at once and moved up to 60 ft (18 m), releasing about 500 years of stress buildup. Soil liquefaction, fissures, landslides, and other ground failures caused major structural damage in several communities and much damage to property. Anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many inadequately earthquake-engineered houses, buildings, and infrastructure (paved streets, sidewalks, water and sewer mains, electrical systems, and other man-made equipment), particularly in the several landslide zones along Knik Arm. Two hundred miles (320 km) southwest, some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by 30 feet (9 m). Southeast of Anchorage, areas around the head of Turnagain Arm near Girdwood and Portage dropped as much as 8 feet (2.4 m), requiring reconstruction and fill to raise the Seward Highway above the new high tide mark.\n\n\nIn Prince William Sound, Port Valdez suffered a massive underwater landslide, resulting in the deaths of 32 people between the collapse of the Valdez city harbor and docks, and inside the ship that was docked there at the time. Nearby, a 27-foot (8.2 m) tsunami destroyed the village of Chenega, killing 23 of the 68 people who lived there; survivors out-ran the wave, climbing to high ground. Post-quake tsunamis severely affected Whittier, Seward, Kodiak, and other Alaskan communities, as well as people and property in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California.[5] Tsunamis also caused damage in Hawaii and Japan. Evidence of motion directly related to the earthquake was also reported from Florida and Texas.\n\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nOn March 27, 1964, at 5:36 p.m. AKST (March 28, at 3:36 a.m. UTC),[a] a fault between the Pacific and North American plates ruptured near College Fjord in Prince William Sound. The epicenter of the earthquake was 12.4 mi (20.0 km) north of Prince William Sound, 78 miles (126 km) east of Anchorage and 40 miles (64 km) west of Valdez. The focus occurred at a depth of approximately 15.5 mi (24.9 km). Ocean floor shifts created large tsunamis (up to 220 feet (67 m) in height), which resulted in many of the deaths and much of the property damage.[6] Large rockslides were also caused, resulting in great property damage. Vertical displacement of up to 38 feet (12 m) occurred, affecting an area of 100,000 square miles (260,000 km2) within Alaska.\n\n\nStudies of ground motion have led to a peak ground acceleration estimate of 0.14–0.18 *g*.[7]\n\n\nThe Alaska earthquake was a subduction zone (megathrust) earthquake, caused by an oceanic plate sinking under a continental plate. The fault responsible was the Aleutian Megathrust, a reverse fault caused by a compressional force. This caused much of the uneven ground which is the result of ground shifted to the opposite elevation.[8]\n\n\n\n## Tsunami[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Calculated travel time map for the tectonic tsunami produced by the 1964 Prince William Sound earthquake in Alaska. Tsunami Travel Times computed using Tsunami Travel Times[9] software v3.1 (P. Wessel). The map does not show the height or strength of the waves, only the calculated travel times.  \n   \n * Red: 1- to 4-hour arrival times\n* Yellow: 5- to 6-hour arrival times\n* Green: 7- to 14-hour arrival times\n* Blue: 15- to 21-hour arrival times.\n\nTwo types of tsunami were produced by this subduction zone earthquake. There was a tectonic tsunami produced in addition to about 20 smaller and local tsunamis. These smaller tsunamis were produced by submarine and subaerial landslides and were responsible for the majority of the tsunami damage. Tsunami waves were noted in over 20 countries, including Peru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Japan, Mexico, and in the continent of Antarctica. The largest tsunami wave was recorded in Shoup Bay, Alaska, with a height of about 220 ft (67 m).[4][10]\n\n\n\n## Death toll, damage, and casualties[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The largest landslide in Anchorage occurred along Knik Arm between Point Woronzof and Fish Creek, causing substantial damage to numerous homes in the Turnagain-By-The-Sea subdivision.\n![](image)The ruin of Portage\n![](image)A plank driven through a tire by the tsunami in Whittier\n![](image)The 5-story JCPenney department store in Anchorage in 1964, following the earthquake.\nAs a result of the earthquake, 131 people are believed to have died:[4] Nine died as a result of the earthquake itself and another 122 died from the subsequent tsunamis all over the world.[11] Five died from the tsunami in Oregon,[12] and 12 died from the tsunami in Crescent City, California.[13][14]\n\n\nThe quake was a reported XI on the modified Mercalli Intensity scale \"indicating major structural damage, and ground fissures and failures\".[15] Property damage was estimated at $116 million[4] ($0.87 billion in 2023 dollars).[16]\n\n\n\nUnited States Geological Survey video explaining the earthquake and footage\n### Anchorage area[edit]\n\n\nMost damage occurred in Anchorage, 75 mi (121 km) northwest of the epicenter. Anchorage was not hit by tsunamis, but downtown Anchorage was heavily damaged, and parts of the city built on sandy bluffs overlying \"Bootlegger Cove clay\" near Cook Inlet, most notably the Turnagain neighborhood, suffered landslide damage. The neighborhood lost 75 houses in the landslide, and the destroyed area has since been turned into Earthquake Park.[17] The Government Hill school suffered from the Government Hill landslide, leaving it in two jagged, broken pieces. Land overlooking the Ship Creek valley near the Alaska Railroad yards also slid, destroying many acres of buildings and city blocks in downtown Anchorage. Most other areas of the city were only moderately damaged. The 60-foot (18 m) concrete control tower at Anchorage International Airport was not engineered to withstand earthquake activity and collapsed, killing William George Taylor, the Federal Aviation Agency air traffic controller on duty in the tower cab at the time the earthquake began.[18]\n\n\nOne house on W. 10th Avenue suffered peripheral damage, but only one block away the recently completed (and still unoccupied) Four Seasons Building on Ninth Avenue collapsed completely, with the concrete elevator shafts sticking up out of the rubble like a seesaw.\n\n\nThe hamlets of Girdwood and Portage, located 30 and 40 mi (48 and 64 km) southeast of central Anchorage on the Turnagain Arm, were destroyed by subsidence and subsequent tidal action. Girdwood was relocated inland and Portage was abandoned. About 20 miles (32 km) of the Seward Highway sank below the high-water mark of Turnagain Arm; the highway and its bridges were raised and rebuilt in 1964–66.\n\n\n\n### Elsewhere in Alaska[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kodiak before and after the earthquake\n![](image)The Valdez townsite was abandoned and relocated following the 1964 earthquake and was used as a pipe yard for the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, as shown in this 1974 photo\nMost coastal towns in the Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula, and Kodiak Island areas, especially the major ports of Seward, Whittier and Kodiak were heavily damaged by a combination of seismic activity, subsidence, post-quake tsunamis and/or earthquake-caused fires. Valdez with 32 dead was not totally destroyed, but after three years, the town relocated to higher ground four miles (6.4 km) west of its original site. Some Alaska Native villages, including Chenega and Afognak, were destroyed or damaged. The earthquake caused the ballistic missile detection radar of Clear Air Force Station to go offline for six minutes, the only unscheduled interruption in its operational history. Near Cordova, the Million Dollar Bridge crossing the Copper River also suffered damage, with Span #4 slipping off its pylon and collapsing. The community of Girdwood was also confined to the southern side of the Seward Highway when water rushed into Turnagain Arm and flooded or destroyed any buildings left standing to the north of the highway. Only the ground immediately along the highway and that on the north side of the road dropped, prompting geologists to speculate that Girdwood may rest upon an ancient cliff face covered by thousands of years of sediment and glacial deposits.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nA 4.5 ft (1.4 m) wave reached Prince Rupert, British Columbia, just south of the Alaska Panhandle, about three hours after the earthquake. The tsunami then reached Tofino, on the exposed west coast of Vancouver Island, and traveled up a fjord to hit Port Alberni twice, washing away 55 homes and damaging 375 others. The towns of Hot Springs Cove, Zeballos, and Amai also saw damage.[19] The damage in British Columbia was estimated at CA$10 million ($96 million in 2023 Canadian dollars or $91 million in 2023 US dollars).[20][21][22]\n\n\n\n### Elsewhere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A winter scene of a \"ghost forest\" that was killed and preserved by salt water along with ruined buildings at the site of the former town of Portage, 2011\nTwelve people were killed by the tsunami in or near Crescent City, California, while four children were killed on the Oregon coast at Beverly Beach State Park.[23] Other coastal towns in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Hawaii were damaged. Minor damage to boats occurred as far south as Los Angeles.[24] Effects of the earthquake were even noted as far east as Freeport, Texas, where tide gauges recorded waves similar to seismic surface waves.[25] Seiches were detected in wells in countries around the world, including England, Namibia, and Australia.[26]\n\n\n\n## Aftershocks[edit]\n\n\nThere were hundreds of aftershocks in the first weeks following the main shock. In the first day alone, eleven major aftershocks were recorded with a magnitude greater than 6.0. Nine more struck over the next three weeks. In all, thousands of aftershocks occurred in the months following the quake, and smaller aftershocks continued to strike the region for more than a year.[24]\n\n\n\n## Recovery efforts[edit]\n\n\nAlaska had never experienced a major disaster in a highly populated area before, and had very limited resources for dealing with the effects of such an event. In Anchorage, at the urging of geologist Lidia Selkregg, the City of Anchorage and the Alaska State Housing Authority appointed a team of 40 scientists, including geologists, soil scientists, and engineers, to assess the damage done by the earthquake to the city.[27] The team, called the Engineering and Geological Evaluation Group, was headed by Dr. Ruth A. M. Schmidt, a geology professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage. The team of scientists came into conflict with local developers and downtown business owners who wanted to immediately rebuild; the scientists wanted to identify future dangers to ensure that rebuilt infrastructure would be safe.[28] The team produced a report on May 8, 1964, just a little more than a month after the earthquake.[27][29]\n\n\nThe United States military, which has a large active presence in Alaska, also stepped in to assist within moments of the end of the quake. The U.S. Army rapidly re-established communications with the lower 48 states, deployed troops to assist the citizens of Anchorage, and dispatched a convoy to Valdez.[30] On the advice of military and civilian leaders, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared all of Alaska a major disaster area the day after the quake. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard deployed ships to isolated coastal communities to assist with immediate needs. Bad weather and poor visibility hampered air rescue and observation efforts the day after the quake, but on Sunday the 29th the situation improved and rescue helicopters and observation aircraft were deployed.[30] A military airlift immediately began shipping relief supplies to Alaska, eventually delivering 2,570,000 pounds (1,170,000 kg) of food and other supplies.[31] Broadcast journalist Genie Chance assisted in recovery and relief efforts, staying on the KENI air waves over Anchorage for more than 24 continuous hours as the voice of calm from her temporary post within the Anchorage Public Safety Building.[32] She was effectively designated as the public safety officer by the city's police chief.[32] Chance provided breaking news of the catastrophic events that continued to develop following the magnitude 9.2 earthquake, and she served as the voice of the public safety office, coordinating response efforts, connecting available resources to needs around the community, disseminating information about shelters and prepared food rations, passing messages of well-being between loved ones, and helping to reunite families.[33]\n\n\nIn the longer term, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led the effort to rebuild roads, clear debris, and establish new townsites for communities that had been completely destroyed, at a cost of $110 million.[31] The West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center was formed as a direct response to the disaster. Federal disaster relief funds paid for reconstruction as well as financially supporting the devastated infrastructure of Alaska's government, spending hundreds of millions of dollars that helped keep Alaska financially solvent until the discovery of massive oil deposits at Prudhoe Bay. At the order of the U.S. Defense Department, the Alaska National Guard founded the Alaska Division of Emergency Services to respond to any future disasters.[30]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)1960s portal\n* ![flag](image)Alaska portal\n\n\n* 2018 Anchorage earthquake\n* 1965 Rat Islands earthquake\n* List of megathrust earthquakes\n* List of earthquakes in 1964\n* List of earthquakes in Alaska\n* List of earthquakes in the United States\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** At the time of the disaster, Alaska was divided between four separate time zones, Anchorage was five hours behind Eastern Standard Time.

Run-up of 67 m (220 ft) at Shoup Bay, Alaska. |\n| Casualties | 131 killed |\n\n\nThe **1964 Alaskan earthquake**, also known as the **Great Alaskan earthquake** and **Good Friday earthquake**, occurred at 5:36 pm AKST on Good Friday, March 27.[3] Across south-central Alaska, ground fissures, collapsing structures, and tsunamis resulting from the earthquake caused about 131 deaths.[4]\n\n\nLasting four minutes and thirty-eight seconds, the magnitude 9.2 megathrust earthquake remains the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in North America, and the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the world since modern seismography began in 1900. Six hundred miles (970 km) of fault ruptured at once and moved up to 60 ft (18 m), releasing about 500 years of stress buildup. Soil liquefaction, fissures, landslides, and other ground failures caused major structural damage in several communities and much damage to property. Anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many inadequately earthquake-engineered houses, buildings, and infrastructure (paved streets, sidewalks, water and sewer mains, electrical systems, and other man-made equipment), particularly in the several landslide zones along Knik Arm. Two hundred miles (320 km) southwest, some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by 30 feet (9 m). Southeast of Anchorage, areas around the head of Turnagain Arm near Girdwood and Portage dropped as much as 8 feet (2.4 m), requiring reconstruction and fill to raise the Seward Highway above the new high tide mark.\n\n\nIn Prince William Sound, Port Valdez suffered a massive underwater landslide, resulting in the deaths of 32 people between the collapse of the Valdez city harbor and docks, and inside the ship that was docked there at the time. Nearby, a 27-foot (8.2 m) tsunami destroyed the village of Chenega, killing 23 of the 68 people who lived there; survivors out-ran the wave, climbing to high ground. Post-quake tsunamis severely affected Whittier, Seward, Kodiak, and other Alaskan communities, as well as people and property in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California.[5] Tsunamis also caused damage in Hawaii and Japan. Evidence of motion directly related to the earthquake was also reported from Florida and Texas.\n\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nOn March 27, 1964, at 5:36 p.m. AKST (March 28, at 3:36 a.m. UTC),[a] a fault between the Pacific and North American plates ruptured near College Fjord in Prince William Sound. The epicenter of the earthquake was 12.4 mi (20.0 km) north of Prince William Sound, 78 miles (126 km) east of Anchorage and 40 miles (64 km) west of Valdez. The focus occurred at a depth of approximately 15.5 mi (24.9 km). Ocean floor shifts created large tsunamis (up to 220 feet (67 m) in height), which resulted in many of the deaths and much of the property damage.[6] Large rockslides were also caused, resulting in great property damage. Vertical displacement of up to 38 feet (12 m) occurred, affecting an area of 100,000 square miles (260,000 km2) within Alaska.\n\n\nStudies of ground motion have led to a peak ground acceleration estimate of 0.14–0.18 *g*.[7]\n\n\nThe Alaska earthquake was a subduction zone (megathrust) earthquake, caused by an oceanic plate sinking under a continental plate. The fault responsible was the Aleutian Megathrust, a reverse fault caused by a compressional force. This caused much of the uneven ground which is the result of ground shifted to the opposite elevation.[8]\n\n\n\n## Tsunami[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Calculated travel time map for the tectonic tsunami produced by the 1964 Prince William Sound earthquake in Alaska. Tsunami Travel Times computed using Tsunami Travel Times[9] software v3.1 (P. Wessel). The map does not show the height or strength of the waves, only the calculated travel times.  \n   \n * Red: 1- to 4-hour arrival times\n* Yellow: 5- to 6-hour arrival times\n* Green: 7- to 14-hour arrival times\n* Blue: 15- to 21-hour arrival times.\n\nTwo types of tsunami were produced by this subduction zone earthquake. There was a tectonic tsunami produced in addition to about 20 smaller and local tsunamis. These smaller tsunamis were produced by submarine and subaerial landslides and were responsible for the majority of the tsunami damage. Tsunami waves were noted in over 20 countries, including Peru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Japan, Mexico, and in the continent of Antarctica. The largest tsunami wave was recorded in Shoup Bay, Alaska, with a height of about 220 ft (67 m).[4][10]\n\n\n\n## Death toll, damage, and casualties[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The largest landslide in Anchorage occurred along Knik Arm between Point Woronzof and Fish Creek, causing substantial damage to numerous homes in the Turnagain-By-The-Sea subdivision.\n![](image)The ruin of Portage\n![](image)A plank driven through a tire by the tsunami in Whittier\n![](image)The 5-story JCPenney department store in Anchorage in 1964, following the earthquake.\nAs a result of the earthquake, 131 people are believed to have died:[4] Nine died as a result of the earthquake itself and another 122 died from the subsequent tsunamis all over the world.[11] Five died from the tsunami in Oregon,[12] and 12 died from the tsunami in Crescent City, California.[13][14]\n\n\nThe quake was a reported XI on the modified Mercalli Intensity scale \"indicating major structural damage, and ground fissures and failures\".[15] Property damage was estimated at $116 million[4] ($0.87 billion in 2023 dollars).[16]\n\n\n\nUnited States Geological Survey video explaining the earthquake and footage\n### Anchorage area[edit]\n\n\nMost damage occurred in Anchorage, 75 mi (121 km) northwest of the epicenter. Anchorage was not hit by tsunamis, but downtown Anchorage was heavily damaged, and parts of the city built on sandy bluffs overlying \"Bootlegger Cove clay\" near Cook Inlet, most notably the Turnagain neighborhood, suffered landslide damage. The neighborhood lost 75 houses in the landslide, and the destroyed area has since been turned into Earthquake Park.[17] The Government Hill school suffered from the Government Hill landslide, leaving it in two jagged, broken pieces. Land overlooking the Ship Creek valley near the Alaska Railroad yards also slid, destroying many acres of buildings and city blocks in downtown Anchorage. Most other areas of the city were only moderately damaged. The 60-foot (18 m) concrete control tower at Anchorage International Airport was not engineered to withstand earthquake activity and collapsed, killing William George Taylor, the Federal Aviation Agency air traffic controller on duty in the tower cab at the time the earthquake began.[18]\n\n\nOne house on W. 10th Avenue suffered peripheral damage, but only one block away the recently completed (and still unoccupied) Four Seasons Building on Ninth Avenue collapsed completely, with the concrete elevator shafts sticking up out of the rubble like a seesaw.\n\n\nThe hamlets of Girdwood and Portage, located 30 and 40 mi (48 and 64 km) southeast of central Anchorage on the Turnagain Arm, were destroyed by subsidence and subsequent tidal action. Girdwood was relocated inland and Portage was abandoned. About 20 miles (32 km) of the Seward Highway sank below the high-water mark of Turnagain Arm; the highway and its bridges were raised and rebuilt in 1964–66.\n\n\n\n### Elsewhere in Alaska[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kodiak before and after the earthquake\n![](image)The Valdez townsite was abandoned and relocated following the 1964 earthquake and was used as a pipe yard for the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, as shown in this 1974 photo\nMost coastal towns in the Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula, and Kodiak Island areas, especially the major ports of Seward, Whittier and Kodiak were heavily damaged by a combination of seismic activity, subsidence, post-quake tsunamis and/or earthquake-caused fires. Valdez with 32 dead was not totally destroyed, but after three years, the town relocated to higher ground four miles (6.4 km) west of its original site. Some Alaska Native villages, including Chenega and Afognak, were destroyed or damaged. The earthquake caused the ballistic missile detection radar of Clear Air Force Station to go offline for six minutes, the only unscheduled interruption in its operational history. Near Cordova, the Million Dollar Bridge crossing the Copper River also suffered damage, with Span #4 slipping off its pylon and collapsing. The community of Girdwood was also confined to the southern side of the Seward Highway when water rushed into Turnagain Arm and flooded or destroyed any buildings left standing to the north of the highway. Only the ground immediately along the highway and that on the north side of the road dropped, prompting geologists to speculate that Girdwood may rest upon an ancient cliff face covered by thousands of years of sediment and glacial deposits.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nA 4.5 ft (1.4 m) wave reached Prince Rupert, British Columbia, just south of the Alaska Panhandle, about three hours after the earthquake. The tsunami then reached Tofino, on the exposed west coast of Vancouver Island, and traveled up a fjord to hit Port Alberni twice, washing away 55 homes and damaging 375 others. The towns of Hot Springs Cove, Zeballos, and Amai also saw damage.[19] The damage in British Columbia was estimated at CA$10 million ($96 million in 2023 Canadian dollars or $91 million in 2023 US dollars).[20][21][22]\n\n\n\n### Elsewhere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A winter scene of a \"ghost forest\" that was killed and preserved by salt water along with ruined buildings at the site of the former town of Portage, 2011\nTwelve people were killed by the tsunami in or near Crescent City, California, while four children were killed on the Oregon coast at Beverly Beach State Park.[23] Other coastal towns in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Hawaii were damaged. Minor damage to boats occurred as far south as Los Angeles.[24] Effects of the earthquake were even noted as far east as Freeport, Texas, where tide gauges recorded waves similar to seismic surface waves.[25] Seiches were detected in wells in countries around the world, including England, Namibia, and Australia.[26]\n\n\n\n## Aftershocks[edit]\n\n\nThere were hundreds of aftershocks in the first weeks following the main shock. In the first day alone, eleven major aftershocks were recorded with a magnitude greater than 6.0. Nine more struck over the next three weeks. In all, thousands of aftershocks occurred in the months following the quake, and smaller aftershocks continued to strike the region for more than a year.[24]\n\n\n\n## Recovery efforts[edit]\n\n\nAlaska had never experienced a major disaster in a highly populated area before, and had very limited resources for dealing with the effects of such an event. In Anchorage, at the urging of geologist Lidia Selkregg, the City of Anchorage and the Alaska State Housing Authority appointed a team of 40 scientists, including geologists, soil scientists, and engineers, to assess the damage done by the earthquake to the city.[27] The team, called the Engineering and Geological Evaluation Group, was headed by Dr. Ruth A. M. Schmidt, a geology professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage. The team of scientists came into conflict with local developers and downtown business owners who wanted to immediately rebuild; the scientists wanted to identify future dangers to ensure that rebuilt infrastructure would be safe.[28] The team produced a report on May 8, 1964, just a little more than a month after the earthquake.[27][29]\n\n\nThe United States military, which has a large active presence in Alaska, also stepped in to assist within moments of the end of the quake. The U.S. Army rapidly re-established communications with the lower 48 states, deployed troops to assist the citizens of Anchorage, and dispatched a convoy to Valdez.[30] On the advice of military and civilian leaders, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared all of Alaska a major disaster area the day after the quake. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard deployed ships to isolated coastal communities to assist with immediate needs. Bad weather and poor visibility hampered air rescue and observation efforts the day after the quake, but on Sunday the 29th the situation improved and rescue helicopters and observation aircraft were deployed.[30] A military airlift immediately began shipping relief supplies to Alaska, eventually delivering 2,570,000 pounds (1,170,000 kg) of food and other supplies.[31] Broadcast journalist Genie Chance assisted in recovery and relief efforts, staying on the KENI air waves over Anchorage for more than 24 continuous hours as the voice of calm from her temporary post within the Anchorage Public Safety Building.[32] She was effectively designated as the public safety officer by the city's police chief.[32] Chance provided breaking news of the catastrophic events that continued to develop following the magnitude 9.2 earthquake, and she served as the voice of the public safety office, coordinating response efforts, connecting available resources to needs around the community, disseminating information about shelters and prepared food rations, passing messages of well-being between loved ones, and helping to reunite families.[33]\n\n\nIn the longer term, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led the effort to rebuild roads, clear debris, and establish new townsites for communities that had been completely destroyed, at a cost of $110 million.[31] The West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center was formed as a direct response to the disaster. Federal disaster relief funds paid for reconstruction as well as financially supporting the devastated infrastructure of Alaska's government, spending hundreds of millions of dollars that helped keep Alaska financially solvent until the discovery of massive oil deposits at Prudhoe Bay. At the order of the U.S. Defense Department, the Alaska National Guard founded the Alaska Division of Emergency Services to respond to any future disasters.[30]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)1960s portal\n* ![flag](image)Alaska portal\n\n\n* 2018 Anchorage earthquake\n* 1965 Rat Islands earthquake\n* List of megathrust earthquakes\n* List of earthquakes in 1964\n* List of earthquakes in Alaska\n* List of earthquakes in the United States\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** At the time of the disaster, Alaska was divided between four separate time zones, Anchorage was five hours behind Eastern Standard Time.

The New Zealand Army was deployed to the worst affected areas in Canterbury.[11]\n\n\nInsurance claims totalled between NZ$2.75 and $3.5 billion,[22] although it is unclear how much cost can be attributed to each of the earthquake events in the 2010–2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence. The total estimated damage bill was up to $40 billion, making it the fifth-biggest insurance event in the world since 1953.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seismic hazard near the epicentre\nIn the first eighty years of European settlement in Christchurch (1850–1930), four earthquakes caused significant damage, the last of these centred at Motunau on the North Canterbury coast in 1922.[24]\n\n\nModelling conducted for the New Zealand Earthquake Commission (EQC) in 1991 found that earthquakes with a Mercalli intensity of VIII (significant property damage, loss of life possible) could recur on average in the Christchurch area every 55 years. The study also highlighted the dangers of soil liquefaction of the alluvial sediments underlying the city, and the likelihood of significant damage to water, sewer and power supply services.[25]\n\n\nGeologists have recognised about 100 faults and fault segments in the region, some as close as 20 km to central Christchurch. The closest faults to Christchurch capable of producing powerful earthquakes occur in the Rangiora-Cust area, near Hororata, and near Darfield.[26] However, the 2010 quake ruptured the ground surface on a previously unknown fault and involved slip on up to seven individual faults.[27]\n\n\n\n### Event[edit]\n\n\nThe main quake occurred as a result of strike-slip faulting within the crust of the Pacific plate, near the eastern foothills of the Southern Alps at the western edge of the Canterbury Plains.[28] The earthquake epicentre was located about 80–90 km (50–56 mi) to the south and east of the current surface expression of the Australia–Pacific plate boundary through the island (the Alpine and Hope Faults).[28] Though removed from the plate boundary itself, the earthquake likely reflects right-lateral motion on one of a number of regional faults related to the overall relative motion of these plates and may be related to the overall southern propagation of the Marlborough Fault System in recent geologic time.[28] The peak ground acceleration (PGA) measured was 1.26 *g* (12.36 m/s2), recorded near Darfield.[4] GNS scientists considered this an \"extremely rare seismic recording made near a fault rupture\".[16] The February 2011 Christchurch earthquake experienced PGA of 1.51 *g*.\n\n\nGNS seismologists and geophysicists, who believed the 7.1 Mw quake consisted of three or four separate quakes, quickly proposed at least two models for the quake.[29]\nJohn Beavan proposed a four-fault model consisting of a 6.5 Mw quake on the Charing Cross fault, followed by a 7.0 Mw quake on the Greendale Fault, and a 6.2 Mw quake near Hororata, with a 6.5 Mw quake on the fourth fault, which could run between West Melton, Sandy Knolls and Burnham.[29] Caroline Holden proposed a three-fault model, consisting of a 6.3 Mw quake of 2–4 seconds on the Charing Cross fault, followed by a 6.9 Mw quake lasting 7–18 seconds on the Greendale Fault, and an approximately 6.5 Mw quake of 15–18 seconds near Hororata. Ultimately, the event appears to have been an extremely complex earthquake that involved up to seven faults.[27]\n\n\n\n### Aftershocks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Major fault zones in New Zealand, with the plate boundary and relative motion of the Pacific Plate shown\nAt 7 August 2012, the area had experienced 11,000+ recorded aftershocks of magnitude 2 or more, including 26 over 5.0 magnitude, and 2 over 6.0 magnitude.[30] Many caused further damage to buildings in the Christchurch central business district, and some were felt as far away as 300 km to the south in Dunedin.[31][32][33][34]\n\n\nNotable aftershocks, in chronological order, include:\n\n\n\n* On 8 September 2010 a 5.1 magnitude aftershock had an epicentre just 7 km from the Christchurch city centre.[35]\n* On 19 October 2010 a magnitude 5.0 aftershock with a depth of just 9 km caused surface shaking – reported at the time to be the worst since the original earthquake.\n* On 26 December 2010, Boxing Day, a swarm of more than 32 shallow aftershocks,[30] many centred directly under the city,[36] occurred throughout the day, beginning with a 4.2 jolt at 2:07 am. The largest of these, the \"Boxing Day aftershock\", with a magnitude of 4.9, at a depth of 12 km below Opawa[37] was felt very strongly. It caused further damage to at least 20 buildings, the closure of central Christchurch,[38] and cut power to more than 40,000 residents for some time.[39]\n* On 20 January 2011 a magnitude 5.1 aftershock with a depth of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) struck at 6:03 am, waking many residents. The shock caused some minor damage and was felt as far away as the West Coast and Oamaru.[40]\n* On 22 February 2011 an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 was centred at Heathcote Valley, 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from Lyttelton and at a depth of 5 kilometres (3.1 mi). Seismologists regard it as an aftershock of the 2010 earthquake. Many buildings collapsed or were significantly damaged in the quake, among them Christchurch's iconic ChristChurch Cathedral. As of 1 June 2011, 185 people had been confirmed dead.[8]\n* On 6 June 2011 a magnitude 5.5 aftershock with a depth of 15 km centred in Rolleston occurred at 9:09 am, causing power cuts and supermarket closures. The shock was felt widely in the South Island, with reports from as far south as Dunedin and as far north as Nelson. It was the sixth-largest aftershock since the magnitude 7.1 shake in September 2010.[41]\n* On 13 June 2011 a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck Christchurch at a depth of 6 kilometres (3.7 mi). It was preceded by a magnitude 5.6[42] tremor, and affected many structures previously damaged by other earthquakes. The earthquake injured a total of 46 people, while many others were evacuated from the city centre.[43]\n* On 21 June 2011 a magnitude 5.4 aftershock with a depth of 8 km centred south-west of Halswell occurred at 10:34 pm.[44] The shock was felt heavily in Christchurch, causing moderate-heavy content damage in western suburbs such as Upper Riccarton and Hornby. Halswell New World reported that more stock had fallen from shelves in this shake than in the 22 February and 13 June quakes.[45]\n* On 22 July 2011 a magnitude 5.1 aftershock with a depth of 12 km occurred at 5:39 am.[46]\n* 23 December 2011 featured another series of strong shocks, including a 5.8 at 1:58 pm and a 6.0 at 3:18 pm.[47][48][49] The earthquakes interrupted power and water supplies,[50] three unoccupied buildings collapsed and there was again liquefaction in eastern suburbs and rockfalls in hill areas.[51][52] One person died after tripping on uneven ground caused by the earthquake.[13]\n\n\n## Geotechnical reports[edit]\n\n\nThe Earthquake Commission has published two *Geotechnical Land Damage Assessment & Reinstatement Report[s]*. The first *Stage-1* report[53] was published on 21 October 2010. The report briefly describes the mechanics of the earthquake, underlying geology, residential land damage assessment, reconstruction considerations, land and building reinstatement, and remediation options.\n\n\nThe second *Stage-2* report[54] was published on 1 December 2010. It divides the quake-affected areas into three zones, and outlines the remediation plans for these areas.\n\n\n\n## Casualties, damage, and other effects[edit]\n\n\nMost of the damage was in the area surrounding the epicentre, including the city of Christchurch, New Zealand's second-largest urban area with a population of 386,000. Minor damage was reported as far away as Dunedin and Nelson, both around 300–350 kilometres (190–220 mi) from the earthquake's epicentre.[55]\n\n\nThe September 2010 earthquake caused two Christchurch residents to be seriously injured, one by a falling chimney and a second by flying glass, and led to many with less serious injuries. One person died of a heart attack suffered during the quake, with the coroner's report identifying the earthquake as being a contributing factor.[12] Another person died after falling during the quake.[13]\n\n\nThe subsequent 22 February 2011 aftershock caused a large number of deaths and casualties, along with significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\n\n\n### Financial exposure[edit]\n\n\nTotal Earthquake Commission (EQC), private insurance and individual costs were estimated to reach as high as NZ$4 billion according to the New Zealand Treasury.[32] Another projection of the cost covered by insurance (including EQC) was lower at $2.1 billion to $3.5 billion, but would still rank the quake as the world's fifth most costly to insurers.[56]\n\n\nThe Earthquake Commission covers only domestic residences with private insurance and does not provide cover for businesses. The EQC payout is limited to the first $100,000 plus GST of any individual claim, with any amount above that covered by the insurance company holding the policy. The insurance companies themselves had limited or no exposure, having offloaded most of their risk to reinsurance companies. The EQC had reinsurance of $2.5 billion with a $1.5 billion excess, so its exposure was the first $1.5 billion and any amount after the first $4 billion. It had a total fund prior to this earthquake of approx $6 billion.[57]\n\n\nFor comparison, the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake cost NZ£7 million,[58] equal to approximately $650 million in 2010 dollars.[59]\n\n\n\n### Effects in Christchurch[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medway footbridge over the Avon River\nReports of the quake's intensity in Christchurch generally ranged from V to VIII (*Moderate* to *Severe*) on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale.[55] A strong smell of sulphur was widely reported in Christchurch following the earthquake.[60] Sewers were damaged,[*citation needed*] and water lines were broken. The water supply at Rolleston, located to the southwest of Christchurch, was contaminated. Power to up to 75 percent of the city was disrupted.[61] Christchurch Hospital was forced to use emergency generators in the immediate aftermath of the quake.[61] About 90% of the electricity in Christchurch had been restored by 6:00 pm the day of the earthquake. The repair of electricity was estimated to be more difficult in the rural areas.[62] One building caught fire after its electricity was turned back on, igniting leaking LPG in the building. The fire was quickly extinguished by the Fire Service before it could spread.[63] Damage to buried pipes may have allowed sewage to contaminate the residential water supply. Residents were warned to boil tap water before using it for brushing teeth, drinking, and washing or cooking food. Several cases of gastroenteritis were reported.[64][65] By 7 September 28 cases had been observed at the city's welfare centres.[66] The boil water notice for Christchurch and Banks Peninsula was lifted late on 8 September 2010, after more than 500 tests conducted over three days found no contamination.[67]\n\n\nChristchurch International Airport was closed following the earthquake and flights in and out of it cancelled. It reopened at 1:30 pm, following inspection of the terminals and main runway.[68] All schools and early childhood centres in Christchurch City, Selwyn and Waimakariri Districts were ordered shut until Monday 13 September for health and safety assessments.[69][70] The city's two universities, the University of Canterbury and Lincoln University, and the Christchurch campus of the University of Otago were also closed until 13 September awaiting health and safety assessments.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Building damage in Worcester Street, corner Manchester Street, with Christchurch Cathedral in the background\nCrime in Christchurch decreased eleven percent compared with the previous year following the earthquake, although there were initial reports of looting in the city centre and \"known criminals\" trying to pass off as council workers to get into the central city cordon area. Police also observed a fifty-three percent jump in the rates of domestic violence following the earthquake.[72]\nMany more heart attacks than usual were reported in the days following the quake. Usually the heart unit at Christchurch Hospital handles two to three heart attacks a day, but the rate had risen to eight to ten a day since the earthquake.[73] A record number of babies for a Saturday were born at Christchurch Women's Hospital in the twenty-four hours after the quake,[74] with the first baby arriving six minutes after the initial shock.[75] This was at least in part due to outlying birthing centres being closed,[76] pending structural checks, forcing more mothers to deliver at hospitals than was generally the case.\n\n\n\n### Effects outside Christchurch[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Central Kaiapoi suffered major damage; many of the town's buildings had to be bulldozed as a result of the 2010 earthquake and subsequent quake in February 2011.\nThe quake's epicentre was around Darfield, around 40 kilometres (25 mi) from Christchurch.[77] Four metres (13 ft) of sideways movement has been measured between the two sides of the previously unknown fault.[17]\n\n\nIn many towns outside Christchurch, the electrical grid was disrupted, with it taking an estimated two days to fully restore power to those affected.[78][79] Power outages were reported as far away as Dunedin.[80]\n\n\nAccess was restricted to over 350 homes in the town of Kaiapoi, of which about 100 were deemed unsafe.[81] Some 22 commercial properties were deemed unsafe. According to Ron Keating, Mayor of Waimakariri District, the town \"will never be the same again\".[82] As noted above, damage to buried pipes may have allowed sewage to contaminate the residential water supply, and residents were warned to boil tap water before using it for brushing teeth, drinking, and washing or cooking food. A boil water notice for most of Selwyn District was lifted on 9 September.[83] *E. coli* has been found in a water sample from Kaiapoi,[84] and a boil water notice remained in effect for parts of Waimakariri District until 19 September.[85][86]\n\n\nA 5 km (3.1 mi) section of rail track was damaged near Kaiapoi and there was lesser track damage at Rolleston and near Belfast.[87] As a precaution, state rail operator KiwiRail shut down the entire South Island rail network after the earthquake, halting some 15 trains. Two locomotives running light (i.e. without any carriages or wagons) came to a stop just 30 metres short of a major buckle in the line.[88] After inspection, services south of Dunedin and north of Kaikōura recommenced at 10:30 am that day.[89] The Main South Line, linking Christchurch with Dunedin, was given the all-clear and reopened, albeit with a 40 km/h speed restriction north of Ashburton,[88] just after 6 pm to allow emergency aid, including 300,000 litres (70,000 imp gal; 80,000 US gal) of drinking water, to be railed into Christchurch.[90] By the afternoon of Monday 6 September, the entire South Island rail network had reopened with the exception of the Main North Line between Rangiora and Addington. Freight was shuttled by road between the two points, while the TranzCoastal was replaced with a coach service.[88]\n\n\n\n![](image)The tower of St John's Church, Hororata was badly damaged in the quake, as were many other historic buildings Major bridges on state highways and the Lyttelton road tunnel were inspected by the NZ Transport Agency, and found to be in structurally sound condition. The only major road closure outside Christchurch was a slip in the Rakaia Gorge, blocking State Highway 77. The slip was partially cleared by 4 pm to allow a single lane of traffic through the site.[91][92] Kaiapoi's main road was closed for a few days.[93]\n\n\nThe quake caused damage to historic buildings in Lyttelton, Christchurch's port town, including cracks in a church and the destruction of parts of a hotel.[77] The Akaroa area of Banks Peninsula came through the earthquake relatively unscathed, though there was some damage to the town's war memorial and hospital[94] and some homes were extensively damaged. *Duvauchelle Hotel* was also seriously affected.[95]\n\n\nIn Oamaru, 225 kilometres southwest of Christchurch, the earthquake caused part of a chimney on the St Kevin's College principal's residence to fall through the house, and caused the clock atop the Waitaki District Council building to stop at 4:36 am. The earthquake also caused the Dunedin Town Hall clock and the University of Otago clocktower to stop working in Dunedin, some 350 km away from the quake epicentre.[96]\n\n\nThe earthquake was a wake-up call to many New Zealand residents. Two Dunedin supermarkets sold out of bottled water following the earthquake as people stocked up on emergency supplies.[96]\n\n\nMajor stores across the South Island were affected as their distribution centres in Christchurch were closed. Both The Warehouse[97] and Progressive Enterprises (owners of Countdown),[98] which have their sole South Island distribution centres in Christchurch, had to ship essential products to their South Island stores from the North Island, while Foodstuffs (owners of New World and Pak'n Save) had to ship to all their South Island stores from their Dunedin distribution centre.[99]\n\n\n\n### Notable buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The facade of the Repertory Theatre was extensively damaged\nMany of the most badly affected structures in both Christchurch and the surrounding districts were old buildings, including several notable landmarks. Heritage New Zealand board member Anna Crighton said the earthquake had been \"unbelievably destructive.\" The historic homesteads of Hororata and Homebush inland from Christchurch were both extensively damaged, as were Ohinetahi homestead and Godley House on Banks Peninsula.[100] Homebush, located four kilometres from Glentunnel and only 15 kilometres from the earthquake's epicentre, was the historic home of the Deans family, one of the Canterbury Region's pioneer settler families, but was so extensively damaged that it has been described as being \"practically in ruins\".[101]\n\n\nThe seven-storey Manchester Courts (or MLC Building[102]), located at the busy intersection of Manchester and Hereford Streets, was extensively damaged. It was the tallest commercial building in Christchurch when it was built in 1905–06 for the New Zealand Express Company, and blended 1890s Chicago Skyscraper style with English Edwardian architecture. The building had a Category One Historic Places trust classification, but was deemed unsafe and was one of just two historic CBD buildings the City Council initially proposed for immediate demolition.[103] That decision was reversed hours later when the building's owner proposed to dismantle the building over several weeks.[104] Demolition began on 19 October 2010 and was continuing in late January.[105]\n\n\nThe 1911 Anglican church of St. John's in Hororata, five kilometres south of Glentunnel, was extensively damaged when part of its tower collapsed.[106] The port town of Lyttelton's most notable building, the 1876 Timeball station, was also affected by the earthquake, though strengthening work completed in 2005 may have saved it from further damage.[100] In the later Christchurch earthquake in February 2011 the building was severely damaged, and it is planned by Heritage New Zealand for it to be dismantled, with the possibility of reconstruction.[107]\n\n\nThe Valley Inn Tavern in Heathcote, built in 1877, survived the initial quake, but had to be torn down after the large 5.1 magnitude aftershock.[108] Lincoln's historic 1883 public house, The Famous Grouse, was also irreparably damaged and was demolished within days of the earthquake.[109]\n\n\n\n![](image)View of the Oxford Terrace Baptist Church after the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, with props holding the frontage up (It was later destroyed in the 22 February aftershock).\nMany of Christchurch's major landmarks survived intact, including the Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings, the Anglican cathedral, and Christ's College.[110] The Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament (Christchurch Basilica) also survived, although it suffered severe structural damage and also had some windows broken. The central city's iconic Christchurch Press building also survived with only minor damage.\n\n\nMost modern buildings performed as they were designed to do, preserving life rather than keeping the interior in good order. The City Council's own new Civic Building sustained some interior damage, mainly to fixtures and fittings that delayed it being reopened for a week.[111] Others, such as the city's International Antarctic Centre and Christchurch Art Gallery, the latter of which served as the Civil Defence Headquarters during the earthquake aftermath,[95] suffered little or no damage and were able to be used immediately.\n\n\nChristchurch Arts Centre, housed in the former Canterbury College buildings, was less fortunate, with moderate damage to the Great Hall, the Clocktower, and the Observatory.[100]\n\n\nThe structure of the University of Canterbury's buildings survived the earthquake, but its museum collection of Greek and Roman artefacts (the Logie Memorial Collection) was significantly damaged.[112] Also, as many of the bookshelves in the main library were toppled, with repairs expected to take until Christmas, the University arranged electronic access to many academic publishers databases for students about to sit exams.\n\n\nThe Oxford Terrace Baptist Church, constructed 1881–1882, was extensively damaged.[113] Several other Christchurch area churches also suffered serious damage, including St. Mary's Anglican church in Merivale, St. John's Anglican church in Latimer Square, and the Rugby Street Methodist church.[114]\n\n\nThe city's Repertory Theatre, on Kilmore Street in the central city, was reported to be extensively damaged and may be beyond repair,[115] however the Repertory Theatre website notes \"Beneath the rubble the lower façade is intact with not even a broken window. Further into the theatre everything was undisturbed; the auditorium, stage area, fly tower and dressing rooms intact. The historic proscenium undamaged.\"[116]\n\n\nSeveral notable buildings in the Timaru area, 160 kilometres (99 mi) southwest of Christchurch, were also badly affected. A pinnacle on the tower of St Mary's Anglican Church tower fell to the ground, and the recently restored tower itself sustained \"significant cracking\".[117] The spire of St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Temuka was also shifted 10 centimetres (4 in) by the earthquake, leaving it precariously balanced, and the town's historic Royal Hotel was also damaged.[118]\n\n\nHeritage experts urged building owners not to hastily demolish their buildings. The mayor warned of significant penalties for demolishing buildings without consent, and launched a fund to help repair historic buildings damaged by the quake.[119] The Government allocated NZ$10 million towards restoration of such buildings a few days later.[120]\n\n\n\n![](image)Storm drain emerges from a road in Brooklands\n### Liquefaction[edit]\n\n\nA feature of the quake was the damage caused by soil liquefaction. This was particularly the case in the riverside areas of Avonside, Dallington, Burwood, Avondale, and Kaiapoi, and in river delta areas near Bexley, Brooklands, Spencerville, Pines Beach, and Kairaki, with other areas being affected to a substantially lesser degree or not at all.[53] Damage from liquefaction may have been worsened by the high water table from a wet winter.[121]\n\n\nLiquefaction can also cause buried pipes to float up to the surface. This has caused problems for the gravity-fed sewer system, which may need to be completely rebuilt in some areas.[122]\n\n\nWhile the problem had long been well understood by planners,[123][124][125] it is not clear that the public understood it as well, or that it widely influenced development, buying or building decisions.[126] Liquefaction risk at the Pegasus Town site was identified in 2005, so the developers spent approximately $20 million on soil compaction, and the ground there held firm during the quake.[121]\n\n\n\n### Relative lack of casualties[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crack in Bridge Street, South New Brighton\nThe media have remarked on the lack of casualties, despite the close parallels of the quake to incidents that have had devastating consequences in other countries, such as the 1989 San Francisco quake, which killed 63 people and was magnitude 7.1 also. The analysis especially compared the Canterbury quake with the 2010 Haiti earthquake, which also occurred in similar proximity to an urban area, also occurred at shallow depth under the surface, and was of very similar strength. Unlike the many tens of thousands of deaths in Haiti (with some estimates placing the death toll at one in ten or higher), only two deaths directly attributable to the earthquake were reported in New Zealand.[127]\n\n\nThis was ascribed to the fact that the quake happened in the early hours of a Saturday morning, when most people were asleep[15] in timber framed homes, and \"...there would almost certainly have been many deaths and serious injuries had it happened during a busy time of the day...\".[128] Another important factor was building practices which took earthquakes into account, starting after the 1848 Marlborough earthquake and the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake, both of which badly affected Wellington.[127] These led to formal standards after the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake,[129][130] which have since been progressively updated.[131] By contrast, Haiti's much lower standard codes were poorly enforced and many buildings were made of hand-made non-reinforced concrete, which is extremely vulnerable to seismic damage.[132] Ground shaking in populated areas of Canterbury was also generally less strong than for the Haiti quake.[133][134]\n\n\n\n## Emergency response and relief efforts[edit]\n\n\nChristchurch's emergency services managed the early stages of the emergency as the Civil Defence organisation was activated. The St John Ambulance service had sixteen ambulances operational within half an hour of the earthquake and received almost 700 calls within the first 6 hours.[135]\n\n\nPolice promptly arrested a couple of opportunists who had broken into a liquor store shortly after the quake and attempted to take alcohol. Police emphasised this was only an isolated incident. The alleged offenders subsequently appeared in Court on burglary and theft charges in connection with the looting.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA state of emergency was declared for Christchurch at 10:16 am on 4 September, and the city's central business district was closed to the general public.[78] A curfew was put in place from 7 pm to 7 am for parts of the central business district.[11] The New Zealand Army was deployed to help the police enforce the closure and curfew.\n\n\nCivil Defence also declared a state of emergency for Selwyn District and Waimakariri District. The National Crisis Management Centre in the basement of the Beehive in Wellington was activated, while Selwyn District, Waimakariri and Timaru activated their emergency operation centres.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)A structural inspection notice verifies a shop as safe for use\nA Royal New Zealand Air Force C-130 Hercules plane brought 42 urban search and rescue personnel and three sniffer dogs from the North Island to Christchurch the day of the quake,[136] to help check for people buried in the rubble and determine which buildings are safe to use.[137] There were a large number of police and engineers present in the disaster areas. The New Zealand Army deployed personnel upon the request of the Christchurch mayor.[78] Eighty police officers from Auckland were dispatched to Christchurch to assist with general duties there.[138]\n\n\nThe United Nations contacted the New Zealand government and offered its assistance.[78] The United States military offered to send help from Hawaii; local authorities expressed gratitude for the offer, but turn it down saying they had matters under control.[139] The Queen asked the Prime Minister to send her good wishes to the people affected by and helping recover from the quake.[140]\n\n\nPrime Minister John Key, who was raised in Christchurch, visited the scene of the devastation within hours of the earthquake. Christchurch mayor Bob Parker requested that the Prime Minister order the deployment of the New Zealand Army to keep stability and to assist in searches when possible within Christchurch, and the Prime Minister stated that the Army was on standby.[141] New Zealand's Earthquake Commission, which provides government natural disaster insurance, had the role of paying out on claims from residential property owners for damage caused by the earthquake.[142] On 7 September, John Key appointed Cabinet Minister, Leader of the House and MP for the Christchurch electorate of Ilam Gerry Brownlee as the Minister for Earthquake Recovery to oversee the response to the earthquake.[143]\n\n\n\n![](image)Police cordon in Riccarton Road during demolition of damaged buildings\n'Welfare centres' were set up with the help of Red Cross, The Salvation Army and St. John Ambulance at Burnside High School, Linwood College and Addington Raceway, where over 244 people slept on the night after the quake.[144][145][146][147] Tankers delivered drinking water to the welfare centres.[148][149]\n\n\nA joint mayoral relief fund was established by Selwyn District Council, Christchurch City Council and Waimakariri District Council, to which the government initially gave NZ$5 million.[150] The Red Cross and Salvation Army also appealed for donations to fund their own efforts.[151]\n\n\nUnder the National-led Government the Canterbury Earthquake Response and Recovery Act was drafted and passed to assist reconstruction. The Act permitted Government ministers to suspend almost any New Zealand law and attracted criticism from New Zealand and international academics specialising in constitutional law, who claimed that it lacked constitutional safeguards and set a dangerous precedent for future natural disasters.[152]\n\n\nThe response to the earthquake was praised by most citizens with 94% saying that Civil Defence had performed well and 90% saying the City Council had performed well.[153]\n\n\nThe earthquake occurred five weeks to the day before the Christchurch local elections. Following the earthquake, the polls for the mayoral election swung from favourite Jim Anderton to incumbent Bob Parker.[153] Parker went on to win the 9 October election with a majority 53.7% of the vote.[154]\n\n\nA benefit concert, Band Together, was held on 23 October 2010 at Hagley Park.[155]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)New Zealand portal\n* ![](image)Earth sciences portal\n\n\n* February 2011 Christchurch earthquake\n* 2016 Christchurch earthquake\n* Geology of Canterbury, New Zealand\n* June 2011 Christchurch earthquake\n* List of earthquakes in 2010\n* List of earthquakes in New Zealand\n* UC CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquakes Digital Archive\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"New Zealand earthquake report – Sep 4, 2010 at 04:35 (NZST)\". *GeoNet*.

The New Zealand Army was deployed to the worst affected areas in Canterbury.[11]\n\n\nInsurance claims totalled between NZ$2.75 and $3.5 billion,[22] although it is unclear how much cost can be attributed to each of the earthquake events in the 2010–2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence. The total estimated damage bill was up to $40 billion, making it the fifth-biggest insurance event in the world since 1953.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seismic hazard near the epicentre\nIn the first eighty years of European settlement in Christchurch (1850–1930), four earthquakes caused significant damage, the last of these centred at Motunau on the North Canterbury coast in 1922.[24]\n\n\nModelling conducted for the New Zealand Earthquake Commission (EQC) in 1991 found that earthquakes with a Mercalli intensity of VIII (significant property damage, loss of life possible) could recur on average in the Christchurch area every 55 years. The study also highlighted the dangers of soil liquefaction of the alluvial sediments underlying the city, and the likelihood of significant damage to water, sewer and power supply services.[25]\n\n\nGeologists have recognised about 100 faults and fault segments in the region, some as close as 20 km to central Christchurch. The closest faults to Christchurch capable of producing powerful earthquakes occur in the Rangiora-Cust area, near Hororata, and near Darfield.[26] However, the 2010 quake ruptured the ground surface on a previously unknown fault and involved slip on up to seven individual faults.[27]\n\n\n\n### Event[edit]\n\n\nThe main quake occurred as a result of strike-slip faulting within the crust of the Pacific plate, near the eastern foothills of the Southern Alps at the western edge of the Canterbury Plains.[28] The earthquake epicentre was located about 80–90 km (50–56 mi) to the south and east of the current surface expression of the Australia–Pacific plate boundary through the island (the Alpine and Hope Faults).[28] Though removed from the plate boundary itself, the earthquake likely reflects right-lateral motion on one of a number of regional faults related to the overall relative motion of these plates and may be related to the overall southern propagation of the Marlborough Fault System in recent geologic time.[28] The peak ground acceleration (PGA) measured was 1.26 *g* (12.36 m/s2), recorded near Darfield.[4] GNS scientists considered this an \"extremely rare seismic recording made near a fault rupture\".[16] The February 2011 Christchurch earthquake experienced PGA of 1.51 *g*.\n\n\nGNS seismologists and geophysicists, who believed the 7.1 Mw quake consisted of three or four separate quakes, quickly proposed at least two models for the quake.[29]\nJohn Beavan proposed a four-fault model consisting of a 6.5 Mw quake on the Charing Cross fault, followed by a 7.0 Mw quake on the Greendale Fault, and a 6.2 Mw quake near Hororata, with a 6.5 Mw quake on the fourth fault, which could run between West Melton, Sandy Knolls and Burnham.[29] Caroline Holden proposed a three-fault model, consisting of a 6.3 Mw quake of 2–4 seconds on the Charing Cross fault, followed by a 6.9 Mw quake lasting 7–18 seconds on the Greendale Fault, and an approximately 6.5 Mw quake of 15–18 seconds near Hororata. Ultimately, the event appears to have been an extremely complex earthquake that involved up to seven faults.[27]\n\n\n\n### Aftershocks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Major fault zones in New Zealand, with the plate boundary and relative motion of the Pacific Plate shown\nAt 7 August 2012, the area had experienced 11,000+ recorded aftershocks of magnitude 2 or more, including 26 over 5.0 magnitude, and 2 over 6.0 magnitude.[30] Many caused further damage to buildings in the Christchurch central business district, and some were felt as far away as 300 km to the south in Dunedin.[31][32][33][34]\n\n\nNotable aftershocks, in chronological order, include:\n\n\n\n* On 8 September 2010 a 5.1 magnitude aftershock had an epicentre just 7 km from the Christchurch city centre.[35]\n* On 19 October 2010 a magnitude 5.0 aftershock with a depth of just 9 km caused surface shaking – reported at the time to be the worst since the original earthquake.\n* On 26 December 2010, Boxing Day, a swarm of more than 32 shallow aftershocks,[30] many centred directly under the city,[36] occurred throughout the day, beginning with a 4.2 jolt at 2:07 am. The largest of these, the \"Boxing Day aftershock\", with a magnitude of 4.9, at a depth of 12 km below Opawa[37] was felt very strongly. It caused further damage to at least 20 buildings, the closure of central Christchurch,[38] and cut power to more than 40,000 residents for some time.[39]\n* On 20 January 2011 a magnitude 5.1 aftershock with a depth of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) struck at 6:03 am, waking many residents. The shock caused some minor damage and was felt as far away as the West Coast and Oamaru.[40]\n* On 22 February 2011 an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 was centred at Heathcote Valley, 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from Lyttelton and at a depth of 5 kilometres (3.1 mi). Seismologists regard it as an aftershock of the 2010 earthquake. Many buildings collapsed or were significantly damaged in the quake, among them Christchurch's iconic ChristChurch Cathedral. As of 1 June 2011, 185 people had been confirmed dead.[8]\n* On 6 June 2011 a magnitude 5.5 aftershock with a depth of 15 km centred in Rolleston occurred at 9:09 am, causing power cuts and supermarket closures. The shock was felt widely in the South Island, with reports from as far south as Dunedin and as far north as Nelson. It was the sixth-largest aftershock since the magnitude 7.1 shake in September 2010.[41]\n* On 13 June 2011 a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck Christchurch at a depth of 6 kilometres (3.7 mi). It was preceded by a magnitude 5.6[42] tremor, and affected many structures previously damaged by other earthquakes. The earthquake injured a total of 46 people, while many others were evacuated from the city centre.[43]\n* On 21 June 2011 a magnitude 5.4 aftershock with a depth of 8 km centred south-west of Halswell occurred at 10:34 pm.[44] The shock was felt heavily in Christchurch, causing moderate-heavy content damage in western suburbs such as Upper Riccarton and Hornby. Halswell New World reported that more stock had fallen from shelves in this shake than in the 22 February and 13 June quakes.[45]\n* On 22 July 2011 a magnitude 5.1 aftershock with a depth of 12 km occurred at 5:39 am.[46]\n* 23 December 2011 featured another series of strong shocks, including a 5.8 at 1:58 pm and a 6.0 at 3:18 pm.[47][48][49] The earthquakes interrupted power and water supplies,[50] three unoccupied buildings collapsed and there was again liquefaction in eastern suburbs and rockfalls in hill areas.[51][52] One person died after tripping on uneven ground caused by the earthquake.[13]\n\n\n## Geotechnical reports[edit]\n\n\nThe Earthquake Commission has published two *Geotechnical Land Damage Assessment & Reinstatement Report[s]*. The first *Stage-1* report[53] was published on 21 October 2010. The report briefly describes the mechanics of the earthquake, underlying geology, residential land damage assessment, reconstruction considerations, land and building reinstatement, and remediation options.\n\n\nThe second *Stage-2* report[54] was published on 1 December 2010. It divides the quake-affected areas into three zones, and outlines the remediation plans for these areas.\n\n\n\n## Casualties, damage, and other effects[edit]\n\n\nMost of the damage was in the area surrounding the epicentre, including the city of Christchurch, New Zealand's second-largest urban area with a population of 386,000. Minor damage was reported as far away as Dunedin and Nelson, both around 300–350 kilometres (190–220 mi) from the earthquake's epicentre.[55]\n\n\nThe September 2010 earthquake caused two Christchurch residents to be seriously injured, one by a falling chimney and a second by flying glass, and led to many with less serious injuries. One person died of a heart attack suffered during the quake, with the coroner's report identifying the earthquake as being a contributing factor.[12] Another person died after falling during the quake.[13]\n\n\nThe subsequent 22 February 2011 aftershock caused a large number of deaths and casualties, along with significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\n\n\n### Financial exposure[edit]\n\n\nTotal Earthquake Commission (EQC), private insurance and individual costs were estimated to reach as high as NZ$4 billion according to the New Zealand Treasury.[32] Another projection of the cost covered by insurance (including EQC) was lower at $2.1 billion to $3.5 billion, but would still rank the quake as the world's fifth most costly to insurers.[56]\n\n\nThe Earthquake Commission covers only domestic residences with private insurance and does not provide cover for businesses. The EQC payout is limited to the first $100,000 plus GST of any individual claim, with any amount above that covered by the insurance company holding the policy. The insurance companies themselves had limited or no exposure, having offloaded most of their risk to reinsurance companies. The EQC had reinsurance of $2.5 billion with a $1.5 billion excess, so its exposure was the first $1.5 billion and any amount after the first $4 billion. It had a total fund prior to this earthquake of approx $6 billion.[57]\n\n\nFor comparison, the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake cost NZ£7 million,[58] equal to approximately $650 million in 2010 dollars.[59]\n\n\n\n### Effects in Christchurch[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medway footbridge over the Avon River\nReports of the quake's intensity in Christchurch generally ranged from V to VIII (*Moderate* to *Severe*) on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale.[55] A strong smell of sulphur was widely reported in Christchurch following the earthquake.[60] Sewers were damaged,[*citation needed*] and water lines were broken. The water supply at Rolleston, located to the southwest of Christchurch, was contaminated. Power to up to 75 percent of the city was disrupted.[61] Christchurch Hospital was forced to use emergency generators in the immediate aftermath of the quake.[61] About 90% of the electricity in Christchurch had been restored by 6:00 pm the day of the earthquake. The repair of electricity was estimated to be more difficult in the rural areas.[62] One building caught fire after its electricity was turned back on, igniting leaking LPG in the building. The fire was quickly extinguished by the Fire Service before it could spread.[63] Damage to buried pipes may have allowed sewage to contaminate the residential water supply. Residents were warned to boil tap water before using it for brushing teeth, drinking, and washing or cooking food. Several cases of gastroenteritis were reported.[64][65] By 7 September 28 cases had been observed at the city's welfare centres.[66] The boil water notice for Christchurch and Banks Peninsula was lifted late on 8 September 2010, after more than 500 tests conducted over three days found no contamination.[67]\n\n\nChristchurch International Airport was closed following the earthquake and flights in and out of it cancelled. It reopened at 1:30 pm, following inspection of the terminals and main runway.[68] All schools and early childhood centres in Christchurch City, Selwyn and Waimakariri Districts were ordered shut until Monday 13 September for health and safety assessments.[69][70] The city's two universities, the University of Canterbury and Lincoln University, and the Christchurch campus of the University of Otago were also closed until 13 September awaiting health and safety assessments.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Building damage in Worcester Street, corner Manchester Street, with Christchurch Cathedral in the background\nCrime in Christchurch decreased eleven percent compared with the previous year following the earthquake, although there were initial reports of looting in the city centre and \"known criminals\" trying to pass off as council workers to get into the central city cordon area. Police also observed a fifty-three percent jump in the rates of domestic violence following the earthquake.[72]\nMany more heart attacks than usual were reported in the days following the quake. Usually the heart unit at Christchurch Hospital handles two to three heart attacks a day, but the rate had risen to eight to ten a day since the earthquake.[73] A record number of babies for a Saturday were born at Christchurch Women's Hospital in the twenty-four hours after the quake,[74] with the first baby arriving six minutes after the initial shock.[75] This was at least in part due to outlying birthing centres being closed,[76] pending structural checks, forcing more mothers to deliver at hospitals than was generally the case.\n\n\n\n### Effects outside Christchurch[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Central Kaiapoi suffered major damage; many of the town's buildings had to be bulldozed as a result of the 2010 earthquake and subsequent quake in February 2011.\nThe quake's epicentre was around Darfield, around 40 kilometres (25 mi) from Christchurch.[77] Four metres (13 ft) of sideways movement has been measured between the two sides of the previously unknown fault.[17]\n\n\nIn many towns outside Christchurch, the electrical grid was disrupted, with it taking an estimated two days to fully restore power to those affected.[78][79] Power outages were reported as far away as Dunedin.[80]\n\n\nAccess was restricted to over 350 homes in the town of Kaiapoi, of which about 100 were deemed unsafe.[81] Some 22 commercial properties were deemed unsafe. According to Ron Keating, Mayor of Waimakariri District, the town \"will never be the same again\".[82] As noted above, damage to buried pipes may have allowed sewage to contaminate the residential water supply, and residents were warned to boil tap water before using it for brushing teeth, drinking, and washing or cooking food. A boil water notice for most of Selwyn District was lifted on 9 September.[83] *E. coli* has been found in a water sample from Kaiapoi,[84] and a boil water notice remained in effect for parts of Waimakariri District until 19 September.[85][86]\n\n\nA 5 km (3.1 mi) section of rail track was damaged near Kaiapoi and there was lesser track damage at Rolleston and near Belfast.[87] As a precaution, state rail operator KiwiRail shut down the entire South Island rail network after the earthquake, halting some 15 trains. Two locomotives running light (i.e. without any carriages or wagons) came to a stop just 30 metres short of a major buckle in the line.[88] After inspection, services south of Dunedin and north of Kaikōura recommenced at 10:30 am that day.[89] The Main South Line, linking Christchurch with Dunedin, was given the all-clear and reopened, albeit with a 40 km/h speed restriction north of Ashburton,[88] just after 6 pm to allow emergency aid, including 300,000 litres (70,000 imp gal; 80,000 US gal) of drinking water, to be railed into Christchurch.[90] By the afternoon of Monday 6 September, the entire South Island rail network had reopened with the exception of the Main North Line between Rangiora and Addington. Freight was shuttled by road between the two points, while the TranzCoastal was replaced with a coach service.[88]\n\n\n\n![](image)The tower of St John's Church, Hororata was badly damaged in the quake, as were many other historic buildings Major bridges on state highways and the Lyttelton road tunnel were inspected by the NZ Transport Agency, and found to be in structurally sound condition. The only major road closure outside Christchurch was a slip in the Rakaia Gorge, blocking State Highway 77. The slip was partially cleared by 4 pm to allow a single lane of traffic through the site.[91][92] Kaiapoi's main road was closed for a few days.[93]\n\n\nThe quake caused damage to historic buildings in Lyttelton, Christchurch's port town, including cracks in a church and the destruction of parts of a hotel.[77] The Akaroa area of Banks Peninsula came through the earthquake relatively unscathed, though there was some damage to the town's war memorial and hospital[94] and some homes were extensively damaged. *Duvauchelle Hotel* was also seriously affected.[95]\n\n\nIn Oamaru, 225 kilometres southwest of Christchurch, the earthquake caused part of a chimney on the St Kevin's College principal's residence to fall through the house, and caused the clock atop the Waitaki District Council building to stop at 4:36 am. The earthquake also caused the Dunedin Town Hall clock and the University of Otago clocktower to stop working in Dunedin, some 350 km away from the quake epicentre.[96]\n\n\nThe earthquake was a wake-up call to many New Zealand residents. Two Dunedin supermarkets sold out of bottled water following the earthquake as people stocked up on emergency supplies.[96]\n\n\nMajor stores across the South Island were affected as their distribution centres in Christchurch were closed. Both The Warehouse[97] and Progressive Enterprises (owners of Countdown),[98] which have their sole South Island distribution centres in Christchurch, had to ship essential products to their South Island stores from the North Island, while Foodstuffs (owners of New World and Pak'n Save) had to ship to all their South Island stores from their Dunedin distribution centre.[99]\n\n\n\n### Notable buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The facade of the Repertory Theatre was extensively damaged\nMany of the most badly affected structures in both Christchurch and the surrounding districts were old buildings, including several notable landmarks. Heritage New Zealand board member Anna Crighton said the earthquake had been \"unbelievably destructive.\" The historic homesteads of Hororata and Homebush inland from Christchurch were both extensively damaged, as were Ohinetahi homestead and Godley House on Banks Peninsula.[100] Homebush, located four kilometres from Glentunnel and only 15 kilometres from the earthquake's epicentre, was the historic home of the Deans family, one of the Canterbury Region's pioneer settler families, but was so extensively damaged that it has been described as being \"practically in ruins\".[101]\n\n\nThe seven-storey Manchester Courts (or MLC Building[102]), located at the busy intersection of Manchester and Hereford Streets, was extensively damaged. It was the tallest commercial building in Christchurch when it was built in 1905–06 for the New Zealand Express Company, and blended 1890s Chicago Skyscraper style with English Edwardian architecture. The building had a Category One Historic Places trust classification, but was deemed unsafe and was one of just two historic CBD buildings the City Council initially proposed for immediate demolition.[103] That decision was reversed hours later when the building's owner proposed to dismantle the building over several weeks.[104] Demolition began on 19 October 2010 and was continuing in late January.[105]\n\n\nThe 1911 Anglican church of St. John's in Hororata, five kilometres south of Glentunnel, was extensively damaged when part of its tower collapsed.[106] The port town of Lyttelton's most notable building, the 1876 Timeball station, was also affected by the earthquake, though strengthening work completed in 2005 may have saved it from further damage.[100] In the later Christchurch earthquake in February 2011 the building was severely damaged, and it is planned by Heritage New Zealand for it to be dismantled, with the possibility of reconstruction.[107]\n\n\nThe Valley Inn Tavern in Heathcote, built in 1877, survived the initial quake, but had to be torn down after the large 5.1 magnitude aftershock.[108] Lincoln's historic 1883 public house, The Famous Grouse, was also irreparably damaged and was demolished within days of the earthquake.[109]\n\n\n\n![](image)View of the Oxford Terrace Baptist Church after the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, with props holding the frontage up (It was later destroyed in the 22 February aftershock).\nMany of Christchurch's major landmarks survived intact, including the Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings, the Anglican cathedral, and Christ's College.[110] The Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament (Christchurch Basilica) also survived, although it suffered severe structural damage and also had some windows broken. The central city's iconic Christchurch Press building also survived with only minor damage.\n\n\nMost modern buildings performed as they were designed to do, preserving life rather than keeping the interior in good order. The City Council's own new Civic Building sustained some interior damage, mainly to fixtures and fittings that delayed it being reopened for a week.[111] Others, such as the city's International Antarctic Centre and Christchurch Art Gallery, the latter of which served as the Civil Defence Headquarters during the earthquake aftermath,[95] suffered little or no damage and were able to be used immediately.\n\n\nChristchurch Arts Centre, housed in the former Canterbury College buildings, was less fortunate, with moderate damage to the Great Hall, the Clocktower, and the Observatory.[100]\n\n\nThe structure of the University of Canterbury's buildings survived the earthquake, but its museum collection of Greek and Roman artefacts (the Logie Memorial Collection) was significantly damaged.[112] Also, as many of the bookshelves in the main library were toppled, with repairs expected to take until Christmas, the University arranged electronic access to many academic publishers databases for students about to sit exams.\n\n\nThe Oxford Terrace Baptist Church, constructed 1881–1882, was extensively damaged.[113] Several other Christchurch area churches also suffered serious damage, including St. Mary's Anglican church in Merivale, St. John's Anglican church in Latimer Square, and the Rugby Street Methodist church.[114]\n\n\nThe city's Repertory Theatre, on Kilmore Street in the central city, was reported to be extensively damaged and may be beyond repair,[115] however the Repertory Theatre website notes \"Beneath the rubble the lower façade is intact with not even a broken window. Further into the theatre everything was undisturbed; the auditorium, stage area, fly tower and dressing rooms intact. The historic proscenium undamaged.\"[116]\n\n\nSeveral notable buildings in the Timaru area, 160 kilometres (99 mi) southwest of Christchurch, were also badly affected. A pinnacle on the tower of St Mary's Anglican Church tower fell to the ground, and the recently restored tower itself sustained \"significant cracking\".[117] The spire of St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Temuka was also shifted 10 centimetres (4 in) by the earthquake, leaving it precariously balanced, and the town's historic Royal Hotel was also damaged.[118]\n\n\nHeritage experts urged building owners not to hastily demolish their buildings. The mayor warned of significant penalties for demolishing buildings without consent, and launched a fund to help repair historic buildings damaged by the quake.[119] The Government allocated NZ$10 million towards restoration of such buildings a few days later.[120]\n\n\n\n![](image)Storm drain emerges from a road in Brooklands\n### Liquefaction[edit]\n\n\nA feature of the quake was the damage caused by soil liquefaction. This was particularly the case in the riverside areas of Avonside, Dallington, Burwood, Avondale, and Kaiapoi, and in river delta areas near Bexley, Brooklands, Spencerville, Pines Beach, and Kairaki, with other areas being affected to a substantially lesser degree or not at all.[53] Damage from liquefaction may have been worsened by the high water table from a wet winter.[121]\n\n\nLiquefaction can also cause buried pipes to float up to the surface. This has caused problems for the gravity-fed sewer system, which may need to be completely rebuilt in some areas.[122]\n\n\nWhile the problem had long been well understood by planners,[123][124][125] it is not clear that the public understood it as well, or that it widely influenced development, buying or building decisions.[126] Liquefaction risk at the Pegasus Town site was identified in 2005, so the developers spent approximately $20 million on soil compaction, and the ground there held firm during the quake.[121]\n\n\n\n### Relative lack of casualties[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crack in Bridge Street, South New Brighton\nThe media have remarked on the lack of casualties, despite the close parallels of the quake to incidents that have had devastating consequences in other countries, such as the 1989 San Francisco quake, which killed 63 people and was magnitude 7.1 also. The analysis especially compared the Canterbury quake with the 2010 Haiti earthquake, which also occurred in similar proximity to an urban area, also occurred at shallow depth under the surface, and was of very similar strength. Unlike the many tens of thousands of deaths in Haiti (with some estimates placing the death toll at one in ten or higher), only two deaths directly attributable to the earthquake were reported in New Zealand.[127]\n\n\nThis was ascribed to the fact that the quake happened in the early hours of a Saturday morning, when most people were asleep[15] in timber framed homes, and \"...there would almost certainly have been many deaths and serious injuries had it happened during a busy time of the day...\".[128] Another important factor was building practices which took earthquakes into account, starting after the 1848 Marlborough earthquake and the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake, both of which badly affected Wellington.[127] These led to formal standards after the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake,[129][130] which have since been progressively updated.[131] By contrast, Haiti's much lower standard codes were poorly enforced and many buildings were made of hand-made non-reinforced concrete, which is extremely vulnerable to seismic damage.[132] Ground shaking in populated areas of Canterbury was also generally less strong than for the Haiti quake.[133][134]\n\n\n\n## Emergency response and relief efforts[edit]\n\n\nChristchurch's emergency services managed the early stages of the emergency as the Civil Defence organisation was activated. The St John Ambulance service had sixteen ambulances operational within half an hour of the earthquake and received almost 700 calls within the first 6 hours.[135]\n\n\nPolice promptly arrested a couple of opportunists who had broken into a liquor store shortly after the quake and attempted to take alcohol. Police emphasised this was only an isolated incident. The alleged offenders subsequently appeared in Court on burglary and theft charges in connection with the looting.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA state of emergency was declared for Christchurch at 10:16 am on 4 September, and the city's central business district was closed to the general public.[78] A curfew was put in place from 7 pm to 7 am for parts of the central business district.[11] The New Zealand Army was deployed to help the police enforce the closure and curfew.\n\n\nCivil Defence also declared a state of emergency for Selwyn District and Waimakariri District. The National Crisis Management Centre in the basement of the Beehive in Wellington was activated, while Selwyn District, Waimakariri and Timaru activated their emergency operation centres.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)A structural inspection notice verifies a shop as safe for use\nA Royal New Zealand Air Force C-130 Hercules plane brought 42 urban search and rescue personnel and three sniffer dogs from the North Island to Christchurch the day of the quake,[136] to help check for people buried in the rubble and determine which buildings are safe to use.[137] There were a large number of police and engineers present in the disaster areas. The New Zealand Army deployed personnel upon the request of the Christchurch mayor.[78] Eighty police officers from Auckland were dispatched to Christchurch to assist with general duties there.[138]\n\n\nThe United Nations contacted the New Zealand government and offered its assistance.[78] The United States military offered to send help from Hawaii; local authorities expressed gratitude for the offer, but turn it down saying they had matters under control.[139] The Queen asked the Prime Minister to send her good wishes to the people affected by and helping recover from the quake.[140]\n\n\nPrime Minister John Key, who was raised in Christchurch, visited the scene of the devastation within hours of the earthquake. Christchurch mayor Bob Parker requested that the Prime Minister order the deployment of the New Zealand Army to keep stability and to assist in searches when possible within Christchurch, and the Prime Minister stated that the Army was on standby.[141] New Zealand's Earthquake Commission, which provides government natural disaster insurance, had the role of paying out on claims from residential property owners for damage caused by the earthquake.[142] On 7 September, John Key appointed Cabinet Minister, Leader of the House and MP for the Christchurch electorate of Ilam Gerry Brownlee as the Minister for Earthquake Recovery to oversee the response to the earthquake.[143]\n\n\n\n![](image)Police cordon in Riccarton Road during demolition of damaged buildings\n'Welfare centres' were set up with the help of Red Cross, The Salvation Army and St. John Ambulance at Burnside High School, Linwood College and Addington Raceway, where over 244 people slept on the night after the quake.[144][145][146][147] Tankers delivered drinking water to the welfare centres.[148][149]\n\n\nA joint mayoral relief fund was established by Selwyn District Council, Christchurch City Council and Waimakariri District Council, to which the government initially gave NZ$5 million.[150] The Red Cross and Salvation Army also appealed for donations to fund their own efforts.[151]\n\n\nUnder the National-led Government the Canterbury Earthquake Response and Recovery Act was drafted and passed to assist reconstruction. The Act permitted Government ministers to suspend almost any New Zealand law and attracted criticism from New Zealand and international academics specialising in constitutional law, who claimed that it lacked constitutional safeguards and set a dangerous precedent for future natural disasters.[152]\n\n\nThe response to the earthquake was praised by most citizens with 94% saying that Civil Defence had performed well and 90% saying the City Council had performed well.[153]\n\n\nThe earthquake occurred five weeks to the day before the Christchurch local elections. Following the earthquake, the polls for the mayoral election swung from favourite Jim Anderton to incumbent Bob Parker.[153] Parker went on to win the 9 October election with a majority 53.7% of the vote.[154]\n\n\nA benefit concert, Band Together, was held on 23 October 2010 at Hagley Park.[155]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)New Zealand portal\n* ![](image)Earth sciences portal\n\n\n* February 2011 Christchurch earthquake\n* 2016 Christchurch earthquake\n* Geology of Canterbury, New Zealand\n* June 2011 Christchurch earthquake\n* List of earthquakes in 2010\n* List of earthquakes in New Zealand\n* UC CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquakes Digital Archive\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"New Zealand earthquake report – Sep 4, 2010 at 04:35 (NZST)\". *GeoNet*.

Partly as a result of the need for co-operation and peace during the recovery from the tsunami in Aceh, peace talks between the Indonesian government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) were restarted. Accords signed in Helsinki created a framework for military de-escalation in which the government has reduced its military presence, as members of GAM's armed wing decommission their weapons and apply for amnesty. The agreement also allows for local parties to be established, and other autonomy measures.\n\n\n\n### Forest and plantation fires[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Southeast Asian haze, 1997 Southeast Asian haze, and 2015 Southeast Asian haze\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** Vickers (2005), p. 9\n73. **^** Reid (1974), pp. 170–171\n74. **^** Cornelis, Willem, Jan (2008). *De Privaatrechterlijke Toestand: Der Vreemde Oosterlingen Op Java En Madoera* (Don't know how to translate this, the secret? private? hinterland.

The country is known for its natural beauty, rich cultural heritage, and significant contributions to global art, music, and cuisine. It is also one of the world's fastest-growing economies and a major player in the Southeast Asian region.\n\n\n\n\n## Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistoric Indonesia\n\n![](image)\nThe replica of Java man skull, originally discovered in Sangiran, Central Java\n![](image)\nThe syntype fossils of Java Man (*H. e. erectus*), at Naturalis, Leiden\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe arrival of Europeans in South East Asia is often regarded as the watershed moment in its history. Other scholars consider this view untenable,[61] arguing that European influence during the times of the early arrivals of the 16th and 17th centuries was limited in both area and depth. This is in part due to Europe not being the most advanced or dynamic area of the world in the early 15th century. Rather, the major expansionist force of this time was Islam; in 1453, for example, the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople, while Islam continued to spread through Indonesia and the Philippines. European influence, particularly that of the Dutch, would not have its greatest impact on Indonesia until the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n\n\n### The Portuguese[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Portuguese colonialism in Indonesian history\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Megalithic statue found in Tegurwangi, Sumatra, Indonesia, 1500 CE\nThe Indonesian archipelago was formed during the thaw after the Last Glacial Maximum. Early humans travelled by sea and spread from mainland Asia eastward to New Guinea and Australia. *Homo sapiens* reached the region by around 45,000 years ago.[15] In 2011, evidence was uncovered in neighbouring East Timor, showing that 42,000 years ago, these early settlers had high-level maritime skills, and by implication the technology needed to make ocean crossings to reach Australia and other islands, as they were catching and consuming large numbers of big deep sea fish such as tuna.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** Linawati Sidarto, 'Images of a grisly past', *The Jakarta Post: Weekender*, July 2011 \"Grisly Images | the Jakarta Post\".

The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java, Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku, and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces. (Schwartz 1999, pages 3–4) Despite major internal political, social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution, Indonesians, on the whole, found unity in their fight for independence.\n79. **^** Brown (2003), p. 118\n80. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Brown (2003), p. 119\n81. **^** C.

The history prior of the 14th and 15th centuries (1301–1500 CE) is not well known due to the scarcity of evidence. By the 15th century (1401–1500 CE), two major states dominated this period; Majapahit in East Java, the greatest of the pre-Islamic Indonesian states, and Malacca on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, arguably one of the greatest of the Muslim trading empires,[38] this marked the rise of Muslim states in the Indonesian archipelago.\n\n\n\n### Mataram[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mataram Kingdom\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n85. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Kahin (1952), p. 84\n86. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Kahin (1952), p. 86\n87. **^** Brown (2003), p. 131\n88. **^** Brown (2003), p. 132\n89. **^** Gert Oostindie and Bert Paasman (1998). \"Dutch Attitudes towards Colonial Empires, Indigenous Cultures, and Slaves\". *Eighteenth-Century Studies*. **31** (3): 349–355. doi:10.1353/ecs.1998.0021. hdl:20.500.11755/c467167b-2084-413c-a3c7-f390f9b3a092.

These kingdoms (little more than collections of villages subservient to petty chieftains) evolved with their own ethnic and tribal religions. Java's hot and even temperature, abundant rain and volcanic soil, was perfect for wet rice cultivation. Such agriculture required a well-organized society, in contrast to the society based on dry-field rice, which is a much simpler form of cultivation that does not require an elaborate social structure to support it.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ Hinduism\n\t+ Islam\n\t+ Judaism\n* Mass media\n* Military\n* Sport\n* Women\n |\n| ![flag](image) Indonesia portal |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe **history of Indonesia** has been shaped by its geographic position, natural resources, a series of human migrations and contacts, wars and conquests, as well as by trade, economics and politics. Indonesia is an archipelagic country of 16,000 to 17,000 islands (16,056 named and around 6,000 are inhabited) stretching along the equator in Southeast Asia.[1][2] The country's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade; trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history. The area of Indonesia is populated by peoples of various migrations, creating a diversity of cultures, ethnicities, and languages. The archipelago's landforms and climate significantly influenced agriculture and trade, and the formation of states.

Recent discussions, for example, of Dutch cruelty in Aceh have encouraged renewed research on these aspects of Dutch rule.[77] It was only in the early 20th century, three centuries after the first Dutch trading post, that the full extent of the colonial territory was established and direct colonial rule exerted across what would become the boundaries of the modern Indonesian state.[78] Portuguese Timor, now East Timor, remained under Portuguese rule until 1975 when it was invaded by Indonesia.

Other *H. erectus* fossils of a similar age were found at Sangiran in the 1930s by the anthropologist Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald, who in the same time period also uncovered fossils at Ngandong alongside more advanced tools, re-dated in 2011 to between 550,000 and 143,000 years old.[4][5][6][7] In 1977 another *H. erectus* skull was discovered at Sambungmacan.[8] In 2010, stone tools were discovered on Flores, dating from 1 million years ago. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1997 and 1998, Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis,[133] which had dire consequences for the Indonesian economy and society, as well as Suharto's presidency. At the same time, the country suffered a severe drought and some of the largest forest fires in history burned in Kalimantan and Sumatra. The rupiah, the Indonesian currency, took a sharp dive in value. Suharto came under scrutiny from international lending institutions, chiefly the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United States, over longtime embezzlement of funds and some protectionist policies. In December, Suharto's government signed a letter of intent to the IMF, pledging to enact austerity measures, including cuts to public services and removal of subsidies, in return for aid from the IMF and other donors. Prices for goods such as kerosene and rice, as well as fees for public services including education, rose dramatically. The effects were exacerbated by widespread corruption. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2003, on the island of Flores, fossils of a 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall hominid dated between 74,000 and 13,000 years old were discovered, much to the surprise of the scientific community. This newly discovered hominid was named the \"Flores Man\", or *Homo floresiensis*.[11][12] A phylogenetic analysis published in 2017 suggests that *H. floresiensis* was descended from the same ancestor as *Homo habilis.*[13] *H. floresiensis* would thus represent a previously unknown and very early migration out of Africa. The *Homo floresiensis* skeletal material is dated from 60,000 to 100,000 years ago; stone tools recovered alongside the skeletal remains were from archaeological horizons ranging from 50,000 to 190,000 years ago.[14]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Pope, G (15 August 1983). \"Evidence on the Age of the Asian Hominidae\". *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America*. **80** (16): 4988–4992.

These included regional differences in customs, religion, the impact of Christianity and Marxism, and fears of Javanese political domination. Following colonial rule, Japanese occupation, and war against the Dutch, the new country suffered from severe poverty, a ruinous economy, low educational and skills levels, and authoritarian traditions.[104][105] Challenges to the authority of the Republic included the militant *Darul Islam* who waged a guerrilla struggle against the Republic from 1948 to 1962; the declaration of an independent Republic of South Maluku by Ambonese formerly of the Royal Dutch Indies Army; and rebellions in Sumatra and Sulawesi between 1955 and 1961.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNew found Portuguese expertise in navigation, shipbuilding and weaponry allowed them to make daring expeditions of exploration and expansion. Starting with the first exploratory expeditions sent from newly conquered Malacca in 1512, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in Indonesia, and sought to dominate the sources of valuable spices[62] and to extend the Catholic Church's missionary efforts. The Portuguese turned east to Maluku and through both military conquest and alliance with local rulers, they established trading posts, forts, and missions on the islands of Ternate, Ambon, and Solor among others. The height of Portuguese missionary activities, however, came in the latter half of the 16th century. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEuropeans such as the Portuguese arrived in Indonesia from the 16th century seeking to monopolise the sources of valuable nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in Maluku. In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (*Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie* or VOC) and became the dominant European power by 1610. Following bankruptcy, the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800, and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies under government control. By the early 20th century, Dutch dominance extended to the current boundaries. The Japanese invasion and occupation in 1942–1945 during WWII ended Dutch rule, and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement. Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, nationalist leader Sukarno declared independence and became president. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAn attempted coup in 1965 led to a violent army-led anti-communist purge in which over half a million people were killed. General Suharto politically outmanoeuvred President Sukarno, and became president in March 1968. His New Order administration garnered the favour of the West, whose investment in Indonesia was a major factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth. In the late 1990s, however, Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis, which led to popular protests and Suharto's resignation on 21 May 1998. The *Reformasi* era following Suharto's resignation has led to a strengthening of democratic processes, including a regional autonomy program, the secession of East Timor, and the first direct presidential election in 2004.

A few years after Gajah Mada's death, the Majapahit navy captured Palembang, putting an end to the Sriwijaya kingdom. Although the Majapahit rulers extended their power over other islands and destroyed neighbouring kingdoms, their focus seems to have been on controlling and gaining a larger share of the commercial trade that passed through the archipelago. About the time Majapahit was founded, Muslim traders and proselytisers began entering the area. After its peak in the 14th century, Majapahit power began to decline and was unable to control the rising power of the Sultanate of Malacca. Dates for the end of the Majapahit Empire range from 1478 to 1520.

Batavia (now Jakarta), Java, c. 1665 CE.\nBeginning in the 16th century, successive waves of Europeans—the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and English—sought to dominate the spice trade at its sources in India and the 'Spice Islands' (Maluku) of Indonesia. This meant finding a way to Asia to cut out Muslim merchants who, with their Venetian outlet in the Mediterranean, monopolised spice imports to Europe. Astronomically priced at the time, spices were highly coveted not only to preserve and make poorly preserved meat palatable, but also as medicines and magic potions.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nReferences to the Dvipantara or Yawadvipa, a Hindu kingdom in Java and Sumatra appear in Sanskrit writings from 200 BCE. In India's earliest epic, the Ramayana, Sugriva, the chief of Rama's army dispatched his men to Yawadvipa, the island of Java, in search of Sita.[30] According to the ancient Tamil text Manimekalai Java had a kingdom with a capital called Nagapuram.[31][32][33] The earliest archaeological relic discovered in Indonesia is from the Ujung Kulon National Park, West Java, where an early Hindu statue of Ganesha estimated from the 1st century CE was found on the summit of Mount Raksa in Panaitan island. There is also archaeological evidence of Sunda Kingdom in West Java dating from the 2nd-century, and Jiwa Temple in Batujaya, Karawang, West Java was probably built around this time. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOne such early kingdom was Tarumanagara, which flourished between 358 and 669 CE. Located in West Java close to modern-day Jakarta, its 5th-century king, Purnawarman, established the earliest known inscriptions in Java, the Ciaruteun inscription located near Bogor. And other inscriptions called the Pasir Awi inscription and the Muncul inscription. On this monument, King Purnawarman inscribed his name and made an imprint of his footprints, as well as his elephant's footprints. The accompanying inscription reads, \"Here are the footprints of King Purnavarman, the heroic conqueror of the world\". This inscription is written in Pallava script and in Sanskrit and is still clear after 1500 years. Purnawarman apparently built a canal that changed the course of the Cakung River, and drained a coastal area for agriculture and settlement purpose. In his stone inscriptions, Purnawarman associated himself with Vishnu, and Brahmins ritually secured the hydraulic project.[36]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Timorese women with the Indonesian national flag\nIn 1975, the Carnation Revolution in Portugal caused authorities there to announce plans for decolonisation of Portuguese Timor, the eastern half of the island of Timor whose western half was a part of the Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara. In the East Timorese elections held in 1975, Fretilin, a left-leaning party, and UDT, aligned with the local elite, emerged as the largest parties, having previously formed an alliance to campaign for independence from Portugal. Apodeti, a party advocating integration with Indonesia, enjoyed little popular support.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the period 750 CE – 850 CE, the kingdom saw the blossoming of classical Javanese art and architecture. A rapid increase in temple construction occurred across the landscape of its heartland in Mataram (Kedu and Kewu Plain). The most notable temples constructed in Mataram are Kalasan, Sewu, Borobudur and Prambanan. The Empire had become the supreme power not only in Java but also over Srivijayan Empire, Bali, southern Thailand, some Philippine kingdoms, and Khmer in Cambodia.[41]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSriwijaya was a kingdom on Sumatra which influenced much of the Maritime Southeast Asia. From the 7th century, the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it.[43][44]\n\n\nSrivijaya was centred in the coastal trading centre of present-day Palembang. Srivijaya was not a \"state\" in the modern sense with defined boundaries and a centralised government to which the citizens own allegiance.[45] Rather Srivijaya was a confederacy form of society centred on a royal heartland.[45] It was a thalassocracy and did not extend its influence far beyond the coastal areas of the islands of Southeast Asia. Trade was the driving force of Srivijaya just as it is for most societies throughout history.[46] The Srivijayan navy controlled the trade that made its way through the Strait of Malacca.[46]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs the PKI rallied in Jakarta streets in support, the West became increasingly alarmed at Indonesian foreign policy and the United States withdrew its aid to Indonesia.[109]\n\n\nIn social policy, Sukarno's time in office witnessed substantial reforms in health and education,[110] together with the passage of various pro-labour measures.[111] However, Indonesia's economic position deteriorated under Sukarno; by the mid-1960s, the cash-strapped government had to scrap critical public sector subsidies, inflation was at 1,000%, export revenues were shrinking, infrastructure crumbling, and factories were operating at minimal capacity with negligible investment. Severe poverty and hunger were widespread.[109][112]\n\n\n\n## The New Order[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Order (Indonesia)\n\n### Transition to the New Order[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transition to the New Order\n\nSee also: 30 September Movement and Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Bellwood, P., H.

Some of these practices remain in areas including the Batak areas of Sumatra, Toraja in Sulawesi, and several islands in Nusa Tenggara.

However, Suharto enriched himself and his family through business dealings and widespread corruption.[129]\n\n\n\n### Annexation of West Irian[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Western New Guinea Dispute and Operation Trikora\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Japanese bicycle infantry move through Java during their occupation of the Dutch East Indies.\nThe Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during World War II interrupted Dutch rule[89][90] and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement. In May 1940, early in World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the Netherlands, but the Dutch government-in-exile initially continued to control the Dutch East Indies from its base in London. The Dutch East Indies declared a state of siege and in July 1940 redirected exports intended for Japan to the US and Britain. Negotiations with the Japanese aimed at securing supplies of aviation fuel collapsed in June 1941, and the Japanese started their conquest of Southeast Asia in December of that year.[91] That same month, factions from Sumatra sought Japanese assistance for a revolt against the Dutch wartime government. The Japanese military defeated last Dutch forces in the East Indies in March 1942.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n147. **^** Bangun Santoso (14 September 2015). \"Tewas Akibat 'Tercekik' Asap\" (in Indonesian).

The stated purpose of this program was to reduce the considerable poverty and overpopulation on Java, to provide opportunities for hard-working poor people, and to provide a workforce to better utilise the resources of the outer islands. The program, however, has been controversial, with critics accusing the Indonesian Government of trying to use these migrants to reduce the proportion of native populations in destination areas to weaken separatist movements. The program has often been cited as a major and ongoing factor in controversies and even conflict and violence between settlers and indigenous populations.\n\n\n\n## Reform Era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Post-Suharto era\n\nSee also: Indonesian Revolution of 1998\n\n### Pro-democracy movement[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Sewu temple in Special Region of Yogyakarta\nLater in its history, the dynasty divided into two dynasties based on their own religion, the Buddhist and Shivaist dynasties. Civil war was unavoidable and the outcome was Mataram Empire divided into two powerful kingdom based on region and religion. The Shivaist dynasty of Mataram kingdom in Java led by Rakai Pikatan and the Buddhist dynasty of Srivijaya kingdom in Sumatra led by Balaputradewa. The hostility between them didn't end until in 1006 when the Sailendran based in Srivijaya kingdom incited rebellion by Wurawari, vassal of Mataram kingdom and sacked Shivaist dynasty's capital in Watugaluh, Java. Srivijaya kingdom rose into undisputed hegemonic Empire in the era as the result. Yet the Shivaist dynasty survived and successfully reclaimed the east Java in 1019 then descended to Kahuripan kingdom led by Airlangga son of Udayana of Bali.[42]\n\n\n\n### Sriwijaya[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Srivijaya\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Dutch imperial painting depicting the Dutch East Indies as \"our most precious gem\" (1916)\nThe Dutch colonials formed a privileged upper social class of soldiers, administrators, managers, teachers, and pioneers.

The kingdom was ruled by the Sailendra dynasty, and later by the Sanjaya dynasty. The centre of the kingdom was moved from central Java to East Java by Mpu Sindok. An eruption of the volcano Mount Merapi in 929, and political pressure from Sailendrans based in the Srivijaya Empire may have caused the move.\n\n\nThe first king of Mataram, Sri Sanjaya, left inscriptions in stone.[40] The monumental Hindu temple of Prambanan in the vicinity of Yogyakarta was built by Pikatan.

It was the largest non-ruling communist party in the world before its eradication in 1965 and ban the following year.\nDescribed as the great *dalang* (\"puppet master\"), Sukarno's position depended on balancing the opposing and increasingly hostile forces of the army and the PKI. Sukarno's anti-imperialist ideology saw Indonesia increasingly dependent on Soviet and then communist China. By 1965, the PKI was the largest communist party in the world outside the Soviet Union or China. Penetrating all levels of government, the party increasingly gained influence at the expense of the army.[113]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1806, King Lodewijk of the Netherlands sent one of his generals, Herman Willem Daendels, to serve as governor-general of the East Indies, based in Java. Daendels was sent to strengthen Javanese defences against a predicted British invasion. Since 1685, the British had had a presence in Bencoolen on the western coast of Sumatra, as well as several posts north of the Malaccan straits. Daendels was responsible for the construction of the Great Post Road (Indonesian: *Jalan Raya Pos*) across northern Java from Anjer to Panaroecan. The thousand-kilometre road was meant as to ease logistics across Java and was completed in only one year, during which thousands of Javanese forced labourers died.[65] In 1811, Java was captured by the British, becoming a possession of the British Empire, and Thomas Stamford Raffles was appointed as the island's governor. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNegotiations with the nationalists led to two major truce agreements, but disputes about their implementation, and much mutual provocation, led each time to renewed conflict. Within four years the Dutch had recaptured almost the whole of Indonesia, but guerrilla resistance persisted, led on Java by commander Nasution. On 27 December 1949, after four years of sporadic warfare and fierce criticism of the Dutch by the UN, the Netherlands officially recognised Indonesian sovereignty under the federal structure of the United States of Indonesia (RUSI). With the unification of all the kingdoms in the archipelago On 17 August 1950, exactly five years after the proclamation of independence, the last of the federal states were dissolved and Sukarno proclaimed a single unitary Republic of Indonesia until now.[103][94]\n\n\n\n## Sukarno's presidency[edit]\n\n\n### Democratic experiment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Liberal democracy period in Indonesia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Abortion\n* Crime\n* Human trafficking\n* Piracy\n* Prostitution\n* Smoking\n |\n| Culture | * Architecture\n\t+ Candi\n\t+ Colonial\n\t+ Mosques\n\t+ *Rumah adat*\n* Art\n* Cinema\n* Costume\n* Cuisine\n* Dance\n* Festivals\n* Legends\n* Literature\n* Martial arts\n* Media\n* Music\n* Mythology\n* National heroes\n* Painting\n* Properties\n* Public holidays\n* Sport\n* Theatre\n* Video games\n |\n| Demographics | * Education\n* Ethnic groups\n* Health\n\t+ Healthcare\n* Homelessness\n* Languages\n* Religion\n* Refugees\n* Women\n* LGBT rights\n |\n| Symbols | * Anthem\n* Costume\n* Emblem\n\t+ Historical\n\t+ Subdivision\n* Faunal emblems\n* Flag\n\t+ Subdivision\n* Floral emblems\n* Motto\n* Nusantara\n* Personification\n* Songs\n |\n\n |\n| * Outline\n* Index\n\n* Category\n* Portal\n* Gallery\n* Atlas\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe austerity measures approved by Suharto had started to erode domestic confidence with the New Order[134] and led to popular protests.\n\n\nSuharto stood for re-election by parliament for the seventh time in March 1998, justifying it on the grounds of the necessity of his leadership during the crisis. The parliament approved a new term. This sparked protests and riots throughout the country, now termed the Indonesian 1998 Revolution.

They were warned to vote in favour of Indonesian integration with the group unanimously voting for integration with Indonesia.[130] A subsequent UN General Assembly resolution confirmed the transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia.\n\n\nWest Irian was renamed Irian Jaya ('glorious Irian') in 1973.

Other scholars consider this view untenable,[61] arguing that European influence during the times of the early arrivals of the 16th and 17th centuries was limited in both area and depth. This is in part due to Europe not being the most advanced or dynamic area of the world in the early 15th century. Rather, the major expansionist force of this time was Islam; in 1453, for example, the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople, while Islam continued to spread through Indonesia and the Philippines. European influence, particularly that of the Dutch, would not have its greatest impact on Indonesia until the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n\n\n### The Portuguese[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Portuguese colonialism in Indonesian history\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Megalithic statue found in Tegurwangi, Sumatra, Indonesia, 1500 CE\nThe Indonesian archipelago was formed during the thaw after the Last Glacial Maximum.

These kingdoms (little more than collections of villages subservient to petty chieftains) evolved with their own ethnic and tribal religions. Java's hot and even temperature, abundant rain and volcanic soil, was perfect for wet rice cultivation. Such agriculture required a well-organized society, in contrast to the society based on dry-field rice, which is a much simpler form of cultivation that does not require an elaborate social structure to support it.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ Hinduism\n\t+ Islam\n\t+ Judaism\n* Mass media\n* Military\n* Sport\n* Women\n |\n| ![flag](image) Indonesia portal |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe **history of Indonesia** has been shaped by its geographic position, natural resources, a series of human migrations and contacts, wars and conquests, as well as by trade, economics and politics. Indonesia is an archipelagic country of 16,000 to 17,000 islands (16,056 named and around 6,000 are inhabited) stretching along the equator in Southeast Asia.[1][2] The country's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade; trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history. The area of Indonesia is populated by peoples of various migrations, creating a diversity of cultures, ethnicities, and languages. The archipelago's landforms and climate significantly influenced agriculture and trade, and the formation of states. The boundaries of the state of Indonesia match the 20th-century borders of the Dutch East Indies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Vickers, Adrian (2005). *A History of Modern Indonesia*.

By 1950, Dutch engineers had built and upgraded a road network with 12,000 km of asphalted surface, 41,000 km of metalled road area and 16,000 km of gravel surfaces.[75] In addition the Dutch built 7,500 kilometres (4,700 mi) of railways, bridges, irrigation systems covering 1.4 million hectares (5,400 sq mi) of rice fields, several harbours, and 140 public drinking water systems. These Dutch constructed public works became the economic base of the colonial state; after independence, they became the basis of the Indonesian infrastructure.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Ternate Sultanate |  1257–1914 |\n| Samudera Pasai Sultanate |  1267–1521 |\n| Pagaruyung Kingdom |  1347–1833 |\n| Brunei Sultanate |  1368–1888 |\n| Malacca Sultanate |  1400–1511 |\n| Sulu Sultanate |  1405–1851 |\n| Cirebon Sultanate |  1445–1677 |\n| Demak Sultanate |  1475–1554 |\n| Aceh Sultanate |  1496–1903 |\n| Sultanate of Ternate |  1486–1914 |\n| Sultanate of Bacan |  1515–1946 |\n| Sultanate of Tidore |  1500s–1967 |\n| Sultanate of Jailolo |  1496–1903 |\n| Banten Sultanate |  1526–1813 |\n| Banjar Sultanate |  1526–1863 |\n| Kalinyamat Sultanate |  1527–1599 |\n| Mataram Sultanate |  1500s–1700s |\n| Johor Sultanate |  1528s–1877 |\n| Kingdom of Kaimana |  1600s–1926 |\n| Palembang Sultanate |  1659–1823 |\n| Siak Sultanate |  1725–1946 |\n| Surakarta Sunanate |  1745–1946 |\n| Yogyakarta Sultanate |  1755–1945 |\n| Deli Sultanate |  1814–1946 |\n| Riau-Lingga Sultanate |  1824–1911 |\n |\n| Christian kingdoms\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Larantuka Kingdom |  1515–1904 |\n| Kingdom of Bolaang Mongondow | 1670–1950 |\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLater his son converted to Islam and founded the Sultanate of Malacca on the Malay peninsula.\n\n\n\n### Singhasari and Majapahit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nArchaeological remains in Trowulan, the capital city of the Majapahit\n\nMain articles: Singhasari and Majapahit\n\n![](image)\nExpansion of the Majapahit empire extended to much of the Indonesian archipelago until it receded and fell in the early 16th century.\nFile:Illustration of Gajah Mada.jpg\nModern illustration of Gajah Mada, a powerful military leader, credited with bringing the empire to its peak of glory\n\nMajapahit was the most dominant of Indonesia's pre-Islamic states.[38] The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century, and under Gajah Mada it experienced what is often referred to as a golden age in Indonesian history,[50] when its influence extended to much of southern Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, and Bali[51] from about 1293 to around 1500.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRaffles launched several military expeditions against local Javanese princes; such as the assault on Yogyakarta kraton on 21 June 1812, and the military expedition against Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II of Palembang, along with giving orders to seize the nearby Bangka Island.[66][67] During his administration, numbers of ancient monuments in Java were rediscovered, excavated and systematically catalogued for the first time, the most important one being the rediscovery of Borobudur Buddhist temple in Central Java.[68][69] Raffles was an enthusiast of the island's history, as he wrote the book History of Java published later in 1817.

The company's assets in East Indies were nationalised as the Dutch colony, the Dutch East Indies. Meanwhile, Europe was devastated by the Napoleonic Wars. In the Netherlands, Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806 oversaw the dissolution of the Batavian Republic, which was replaced by the Kingdom of Holland, a French puppet kingdom ruled by Napoleon's third brother Louis Bonaparte (Lodewijk Napoleon). The East Indies were treated as a proxy French colony, administered through a Dutch intermediary.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2007, an analysis of cut marks on two bovid bones found in Sangiran, showed them to have been made 1.5 to 1.6 million years ago by clamshell tools. This is the oldest evidence for the presence of early humans in Indonesia. Fossilised remains of *Homo erectus* in Indonesia, popularly known as the \"Java Man\" were first discovered by the Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois at Trinil in 1891, and are at least 700,000 years old. Other *H. erectus* fossils of a similar age were found at Sangiran in the 1930s by the anthropologist Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald, who in the same time period also uncovered fossils at Ngandong alongside more advanced tools, re-dated in 2011 to between 550,000 and 143,000 years old.[4][5][6][7] In 1977 another *H. erectus* skull was discovered at Sambungmacan.[8] In 2010, stone tools were discovered on Flores, dating from 1 million years ago. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1997 and 1998, Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis,[133] which had dire consequences for the Indonesian economy and society, as well as Suharto's presidency. At the same time, the country suffered a severe drought and some of the largest forest fires in history burned in Kalimantan and Sumatra. The rupiah, the Indonesian currency, took a sharp dive in value. Suharto came under scrutiny from international lending institutions, chiefly the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United States, over longtime embezzlement of funds and some protectionist policies. In December, Suharto's government signed a letter of intent to the IMF, pledging to enact austerity measures, including cuts to public services and removal of subsidies, in return for aid from the IMF and other donors. Prices for goods such as kerosene and rice, as well as fees for public services including education, rose dramatically. The effects were exacerbated by widespread corruption. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2003, on the island of Flores, fossils of a 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall hominid dated between 74,000 and 13,000 years old were discovered, much to the surprise of the scientific community. This newly discovered hominid was named the \"Flores Man\", or *Homo floresiensis*.[11][12] A phylogenetic analysis published in 2017 suggests that *H. floresiensis* was descended from the same ancestor as *Homo habilis.*[13] *H. floresiensis* would thus represent a previously unknown and very early migration out of Africa. The *Homo floresiensis* skeletal material is dated from 60,000 to 100,000 years ago; stone tools recovered alongside the skeletal remains were from archaeological horizons ranging from 50,000 to 190,000 years ago.[14]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Pope, G (15 August 1983). \"Evidence on the Age of the Asian Hominidae\". *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America*. **80** (16): 4988–4992.

Starting with the first exploratory expeditions sent from newly conquered Malacca in 1512, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in Indonesia, and sought to dominate the sources of valuable spices[62] and to extend the Catholic Church's missionary efforts. The Portuguese turned east to Maluku and through both military conquest and alliance with local rulers, they established trading posts, forts, and missions on the islands of Ternate, Ambon, and Solor among others. The height of Portuguese missionary activities, however, came in the latter half of the 16th century. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEuropeans such as the Portuguese arrived in Indonesia from the 16th century seeking to monopolise the sources of valuable nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in Maluku. In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (*Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie* or VOC) and became the dominant European power by 1610. Following bankruptcy, the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800, and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies under government control. By the early 20th century, Dutch dominance extended to the current boundaries. The Japanese invasion and occupation in 1942–1945 during WWII ended Dutch rule, and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement. Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, nationalist leader Sukarno declared independence and became president. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAn attempted coup in 1965 led to a violent army-led anti-communist purge in which over half a million people were killed. General Suharto politically outmanoeuvred President Sukarno, and became president in March 1968. His New Order administration garnered the favour of the West, whose investment in Indonesia was a major factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth. In the late 1990s, however, Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis, which led to popular protests and Suharto's resignation on 21 May 1998. The *Reformasi* era following Suharto's resignation has led to a strengthening of democratic processes, including a regional autonomy program, the secession of East Timor, and the first direct presidential election in 2004. Political instability, social unrest, corruption, natural disasters, and terrorism remained problems in the 2000s, but the economy has performed strongly since 2007. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPresident Habibie quickly assembled a cabinet. One of its main tasks was to re-establish International Monetary Fund and donor community support for an economic stabilisation program. He moved quickly to release political prisoners and lift some controls on freedom of speech and association. Elections for the national, provincial, and sub-provincial parliaments were held on 7 June 1999. In the elections for the national parliament, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P, led by Sukarno's daughter Megawati Sukarnoputri) won 34% of the vote; Golkar (Suharto's party, formerly the only legal party of government) 22%; United Development Party (PPP, led by Hamzah Haz) 12%; and National Awakening Party (PKB, led by Abdurrahman Wahid) 10%.\n\n\n\n\n### May 1998 riots of Indonesia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: May 1998 riots of Indonesia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGajah Mada, a Majapahit prime minister and regent from 1331 to 1364, extended the empire's rule to the surrounding islands. A few years after Gajah Mada's death, the Majapahit navy captured Palembang, putting an end to the Sriwijaya kingdom. Although the Majapahit rulers extended their power over other islands and destroyed neighbouring kingdoms, their focus seems to have been on controlling and gaining a larger share of the commercial trade that passed through the archipelago. About the time Majapahit was founded, Muslim traders and proselytisers began entering the area. After its peak in the 14th century, Majapahit power began to decline and was unable to control the rising power of the Sultanate of Malacca. Dates for the end of the Majapahit Empire range from 1478 to 1520. A large number of courtiers, artisans, priests, and members of the royal family moved east to the island of Bali at the end of Majapahit power.\n\n\n\n## The age of Islamic states[edit]\n\n\n### The spread of Islam[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hindley, Donald. *The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951–1963* (U of California Press, 1966).\n* Kahin, George McTurnan (1952). *Nationalism and Revolution in Indonesia*.

Batavia (now Jakarta), Java, c. 1665 CE.\nBeginning in the 16th century, successive waves of Europeans—the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and English—sought to dominate the spice trade at its sources in India and the 'Spice Islands' (Maluku) of Indonesia. This meant finding a way to Asia to cut out Muslim merchants who, with their Venetian outlet in the Mediterranean, monopolised spice imports to Europe. Astronomically priced at the time, spices were highly coveted not only to preserve and make poorly preserved meat palatable, but also as medicines and magic potions.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nReferences to the Dvipantara or Yawadvipa, a Hindu kingdom in Java and Sumatra appear in Sanskrit writings from 200 BCE. In India's earliest epic, the Ramayana, Sugriva, the chief of Rama's army dispatched his men to Yawadvipa, the island of Java, in search of Sita.[30] According to the ancient Tamil text Manimekalai Java had a kingdom with a capital called Nagapuram.[31][32][33] The earliest archaeological relic discovered in Indonesia is from the Ujung Kulon National Park, West Java, where an early Hindu statue of Ganesha estimated from the 1st century CE was found on the summit of Mount Raksa in Panaitan island. There is also archaeological evidence of Sunda Kingdom in West Java dating from the 2nd-century, and Jiwa Temple in Batujaya, Karawang, West Java was probably built around this time. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOne such early kingdom was Tarumanagara, which flourished between 358 and 669 CE. Located in West Java close to modern-day Jakarta, its 5th-century king, Purnawarman, established the earliest known inscriptions in Java, the Ciaruteun inscription located near Bogor. And other inscriptions called the Pasir Awi inscription and the Muncul inscription. On this monument, King Purnawarman inscribed his name and made an imprint of his footprints, as well as his elephant's footprints. The accompanying inscription reads, \"Here are the footprints of King Purnavarman, the heroic conqueror of the world\". This inscription is written in Pallava script and in Sanskrit and is still clear after 1500 years. Purnawarman apparently built a canal that changed the course of the Cakung River, and drained a coastal area for agriculture and settlement purpose. In his stone inscriptions, Purnawarman associated himself with Vishnu, and Brahmins ritually secured the hydraulic project.[36]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Timorese women with the Indonesian national flag\nIn 1975, the Carnation Revolution in Portugal caused authorities there to announce plans for decolonisation of Portuguese Timor, the eastern half of the island of Timor whose western half was a part of the Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara. In the East Timorese elections held in 1975, Fretilin, a left-leaning party, and UDT, aligned with the local elite, emerged as the largest parties, having previously formed an alliance to campaign for independence from Portugal. Apodeti, a party advocating integration with Indonesia, enjoyed little popular support.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the period 750 CE – 850 CE, the kingdom saw the blossoming of classical Javanese art and architecture. A rapid increase in temple construction occurred across the landscape of its heartland in Mataram (Kedu and Kewu Plain). The most notable temples constructed in Mataram are Kalasan, Sewu, Borobudur and Prambanan. The Empire had become the supreme power not only in Java but also over Srivijayan Empire, Bali, southern Thailand, some Philippine kingdoms, and Khmer in Cambodia.[41]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSriwijaya was a kingdom on Sumatra which influenced much of the Maritime Southeast Asia. From the 7th century, the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it.[43][44]\n\n\nSrivijaya was centred in the coastal trading centre of present-day Palembang. Srivijaya was not a \"state\" in the modern sense with defined boundaries and a centralised government to which the citizens own allegiance.[45] Rather Srivijaya was a confederacy form of society centred on a royal heartland.[45] It was a thalassocracy and did not extend its influence far beyond the coastal areas of the islands of Southeast Asia. Trade was the driving force of Srivijaya just as it is for most societies throughout history.[46] The Srivijayan navy controlled the trade that made its way through the Strait of Malacca.[46]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs the PKI rallied in Jakarta streets in support, the West became increasingly alarmed at Indonesian foreign policy and the United States withdrew its aid to Indonesia.[109]\n\n\nIn social policy, Sukarno's time in office witnessed substantial reforms in health and education,[110] together with the passage of various pro-labour measures.[111] However, Indonesia's economic position deteriorated under Sukarno; by the mid-1960s, the cash-strapped government had to scrap critical public sector subsidies, inflation was at 1,000%, export revenues were shrinking, infrastructure crumbling, and factories were operating at minimal capacity with negligible investment. Severe poverty and hunger were widespread.[109][112]\n\n\n\n## The New Order[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Order (Indonesia)\n\n### Transition to the New Order[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transition to the New Order\n\nSee also: 30 September Movement and Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Bellwood, P., H.

Some of these practices remain in areas including the Batak areas of Sumatra, Toraja in Sulawesi, and several islands in Nusa Tenggara.

The Dutch East Indies declared a state of siege and in July 1940 redirected exports intended for Japan to the US and Britain. Negotiations with the Japanese aimed at securing supplies of aviation fuel collapsed in June 1941, and the Japanese started their conquest of Southeast Asia in December of that year.[91] That same month, factions from Sumatra sought Japanese assistance for a revolt against the Dutch wartime government.

The stated purpose of this program was to reduce the considerable poverty and overpopulation on Java, to provide opportunities for hard-working poor people, and to provide a workforce to better utilise the resources of the outer islands. The program, however, has been controversial, with critics accusing the Indonesian Government of trying to use these migrants to reduce the proportion of native populations in destination areas to weaken separatist movements. The program has often been cited as a major and ongoing factor in controversies and even conflict and violence between settlers and indigenous populations.\n\n\n\n## Reform Era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Post-Suharto era\n\nSee also: Indonesian Revolution of 1998\n\n### Pro-democracy movement[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Sewu temple in Special Region of Yogyakarta\nLater in its history, the dynasty divided into two dynasties based on their own religion, the Buddhist and Shivaist dynasties.

Sukarno's anti-imperialist ideology saw Indonesia increasingly dependent on Soviet and then communist China.

Opposition to Indonesian administration of Irian Jaya (later known as Papua) gave rise to guerrilla activity in the years following Jakarta's assumption of control.\n\n\n\n### Annexation of East Timor[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indonesian occupation of East Timor\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_5kG6RovNmiID8bhper1oqLQB","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The Indian Penal Code came into being.[368] In education, Thomas Babington Macaulay had made schooling a priority for the Raj in 1835 and succeeded in implementing the use of English for instruction. By 1890 some 60,000 Indians had matriculated.[369] The Indian economy grew at about 1% per year from 1880 to 1920, and the population also grew at 1%. However, from 1910s Indian private industry began to grow significantly. India built a modern railway system in the late 19th century which was the fourth largest in the world.[370] Historians have been bitterly divided on issues of economic history, with the Nationalist school arguing that India was poorer due to British rule.[371]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the aftermath, all power was transferred from the British East India Company to the British Crown, which began to administer most of India as provinces. The Crown controlled the company's lands directly and had considerable indirect influence over the rest of India, which consisted of the Princely states ruled by local royal families. There were officially 565 princely states in 1947, but only 21 had actual state governments, and only three were large (Mysore, Hyderabad, and Kashmir). They were absorbed into the independent nation in 1947–48.[367]\n\n\n\n### British Raj (1858–1947)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: British Raj\n\nBritish Raj\n![](image)\nThe British Indian Empire in 1909.

However, historians are divided over the causes of its rise. Probable reasons include a \"clash of interests of the Indian people with British interests\",[402] \"racial discriminations\",[403] and \"the revelation of India's past\".[404]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Mughal Empire reached the zenith of its territorial expanse during the reign of Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707), under whose reign the proto-industrialization[317] led to India surpassing Qing China as the world's largest economy.[318][319] Aurangzeb was less tolerant than his predecessors, reintroducing the *jizya* tax and destroying several historical temples, while at the same time building more Hindu temples than he destroyed,[320] employing significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors, and advancing administrators based on ability rather than religion.[321] However, he is often blamed for the erosion of the tolerant syncretic tradition of his predecessors, as well as increasing religious controversy and centralisation. The English East India Company suffered a defeat in the Anglo-Mughal War.[322][323]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n284. **^** *The Five Kingdoms of the Bahmani Sultanate*\n285. **^** Majumdar, R.

To the west, it reached beyond modern Pakistan, to the Hindu Kush mountains in what is now Afghanistan.

Dissatisfaction with company rule in India led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857. India was afterwards ruled directly by the British Crown, in the British Raj. After World War I, a nationwide struggle for independence was launched by the Indian National Congress, led by Mahatma Gandhi. Later, the All-India Muslim League would advocate for a separate Muslim-majority nation state. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Indian indenture system was an ongoing system of indenture, a form of debt bondage, by which 3.5 million Indians were transported to colonies of European powers to provide labor for the (mainly sugar) plantations. It started from the end of slavery in 1833 and continued until 1920. This resulted in the development of a large Indian diaspora that spread from the Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean and the growth of large Indo-Caribbean and Indo-African populations.\n\n\n\n## Late modern and contemporary period (after c. 1850 CE)[edit]\n\n\n### Rebellion of 1857 and its consequences[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian Rebellion of 1857\n\n* ![Charles Canning, the Governor-General of India during the rebellion.](image)\n\nCharles Canning, the Governor-General of India during the rebellion.\n* ![Lord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856, who devised the Doctrine of Lapse.](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ![Rang Ghar, built by Pramatta Singha in Ahom kingdom's capital Rangpur, is one of the earliest pavilions of outdoor stadia in the Indian subcontinent.](image)\n\nRang Ghar, built by Pramatta Singha in Ahom kingdom's capital Rangpur, is one of the earliest pavilions of outdoor stadia in the Indian subcontinent.\n* ![Chittor Fort is the largest fort on the Indian subcontinent; it is one of the six Hill Forts of Rajasthan.](image)\n\nChittor Fort is the largest fort on the Indian subcontinent; it is one of the six Hill Forts of Rajasthan.\n* ![Ranakpur Jain temple was built in the 15th century with the support of the Rajput state of Mewar.](image)\n\nRanakpur Jain temple was built in the 15th century with the support of the Rajput state of Mewar.\n* ![Gol Gumbaz built by the Bijapur Sultanate, has the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine Hagia Sophia.](image)\n\nGol Gumbaz built by the Bijapur Sultanate, has the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine Hagia Sophia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Maharashtra\n* Uttar Pradesh\n* Punjab\n* Odisha\n* Sindh\n* South India\n* Tamil Nadu\n* Tibet\n |\n| Specialised histories\n* Agriculture\n* Architecture\n* Coinage\n* Demographics\n* Dynasties\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Indology\n* Influence on Southeast Asia\n* Language\n* Literature\n* Maritime\n* Metallurgy\n* Military\n* Partition of India\n* Pakistan studies\n* Philosophy\n* Religion\n* Science and technology\n* Timeline\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAkbar married a Rajput princess, Mariam-uz-Zamani, and they had a son, Jahangir (r. 1605–1627).[310] Jahangir followed his father's policy.

These Mahajanapadas evolved and flourished in a belt stretching from Gandhara in the northwest to Bengal in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent and included parts of the trans-Vindhyan region.[89] Ancient Buddhist texts, like the *Aṅguttara Nikāya*,[90] make frequent reference to these sixteen great kingdoms and republics—Anga, Assaka, Avanti, Chedi, Gandhara, Kashi, Kamboja, Kosala, Kuru, Magadha, Malla, Matsya (or Machcha), Panchala, Surasena, Vṛji, and Vatsa. This period saw the second major rise of urbanism in India after the Indus Valley Civilisation.[91]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Geology | * Fossil Parks\n* Geology of India\n* Indian Plate\n |\n| Heritage | * National Geological Monuments of India\n* Sacred groves of India\n* Sacred mountains of India\n* Sacred rivers of India\n* Stones of India\n |\n| Environment | * Biogeographic classification\n* Biosphere reserves\n* Climate\n* Climate change\n* Earthquakes\n* Ecoregions\n* Environmental issues\n* Fauna\n* Forests\n* Flora\n* Geology\n* National parks\n* Protected areas\n* Wildlife\n* sanctuaries\n |\n| Landforms | * Beaches\n* Canals\n* Coasts\n* Desert\n* ECZ\n* Extreme points\n* Glaciers\n* Highest point by states\n* Islands\n* Lakes\n* Mountains\n* Mountain passes\n* Plains\n\t+ Indo-Gangetic\n\t+ Eastern coastal\n\t+ Western coastal\n* Rivers\n* Valleys\n* Volcanoes\n* Waterfalls\n |\n| Regions | * Central\n* East\n* North\n\t+ Northwest\n* Northeast\n* South\n\t+ Southwest\n\t+ Southeast\n* West\n |\n| Subdivisions | * Autonomous administrative divisions\n* Borders\n* Towns\n* Cities\n* Districts\n* Municipalities\n* States and union territories\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEngraving from *The Graphic*, October 1877, showing the plight of animals as well as humans in Bellary district, Madras Presidency, British India during the Great Famine of 1876–1878.\n* ![Government famine relief, Ahmedabad, India, during the Indian famine of 1899–1900.](image)\n\nGovernment famine relief, Ahmedabad, India, during the Indian famine of 1899–1900.\n* ![A picture of orphans who survived the Bengal famine of 1943](image)\n\nA picture of orphans who survived the Bengal famine of 1943\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe time between the Maurya Empire in the 3rd century BCE and the end of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century CE is referred to as the \"Classical\" period of India.[125] The Gupta Empire (4th–6th century) is regarded as the \"Golden Age\" of Hinduism, although a host of kingdoms ruled over India in these centuries. Also, the Sangam literature flourished from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE in southern India.[126] During this period, India's economy is estimated to have been the largest in the world, having between one-third and one-quarter of the world's wealth, from 1 CE to 1000 CE.[127][128]\n\n\n\n### Early classical period (c. 200 BCE – c. 320 CE)[edit]\n\n\n#### Shunga Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shunga Empire\n\nShunga Empire\n![](image)\nEast Gateway and Railings, Bharhut Stupa, 2nd century BCE.\n![](image)\nShunga art, 1st century BCE.

Following the Dutch, the British—who set up in the west coast port of Surat in 1619—and the French both established trading outposts in India. Although continental European powers controlled various coastal regions of southern and eastern India during the ensuing century, they eventually lost all their territories in India to the British, with the exception of the French outposts of Pondichéry and Chandernagore,[357] and the Portuguese colonies of Goa, Daman and Diu.[358]\n\n\n\n### East India Company rule in India[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: East India Company and Company rule in India\n\nIndia under East India Company rule\n![](image)\nIndia in 1765 and 1805 showing East India Company Territories in pink.\n![](image)\nIndia in 1837 and 1857 showing East India Company (pink) and other territories\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n368. **^** \"Law Commission of India – Early Beginnings\"\n369. **^** Suresh Chandra Ghosh (1995). \"Bentinck, Macaulay and the introduction of English education in India\". *History of Education*. **24** (1): 17–25. doi:10.1080/0046760950240102.\n370. **^** I.D.

Especially focused in the Central Ganges plain but also spreading across vast areas of the northern and central Indian subcontinent, this culture is characterized by the emergence of large cities with massive fortifications, significant population growth, increased social stratification, wide-ranging trade networks, construction of public architecture and water channels, specialized craft industries, a system of weights, punch-marked coins, and the introduction of writing in the form of Brahmi and Kharosthi scripts.[95][96] The language of the gentry at that time was Sanskrit, while the languages of the general population of northern India are referred to as Prakrits.\n\n\nMany of the sixteen kingdoms had coalesced into four major ones by 500/400 BCE, by the time of Gautama Buddha. These four were Vatsa, Avanti, Kosala, and Magadha.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Early Magadha dynasties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the fall of the Maratha Empire, many Maratha dynasties and states became vassals in a subsidiary alliance with the British. With the decline of the Sikh Empire, after the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1846, under the terms of the Treaty of Amritsar, the British government sold Kashmir to Maharaja Gulab Singh and the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, the second-largest princely state in British India, was created by the Dogra dynasty.[349][350] While in Eastern and Northeastern India, the Hindu and Buddhist states of Cooch Behar Kingdom, Twipra Kingdom and Kingdom of Sikkim were annexed by the British and made vassal princely state.\n\n\nAfter the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Polygar states emerged in Southern India; and managed to weather invasions and flourished until the Polygar Wars, where they were defeated by the British East India Company forces.[351] Around the 18th century, the Kingdom of Nepal was formed by Rajput rulers.[352]\n\n\n\n### European exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial India\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Indian cultural influence (Greater India)\n![](image)Timeline of Indian history\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n399. **^** \"Information about the Indian National Congress\". *open.ac.uk*.

The Maurya Empire would collapse in 185 BCE, on the assassination of the then-emperor Brihadratha by his general Pushyamitra Shunga. Shunga would go on to form the Shunga Empire in the north and northeast of the subcontinent, while the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom would claim the northwest and found the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties, including the Gupta Empire, in the 4th to 6th centuries CE. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the Classical or Golden Age of India. Aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and religion spread to much of Asia, which led to the establishment of Indianised kingdoms in the region, forming Greater India.[4][5] The most significant event between the 7th and 11th century was the Tripartite struggle centred on Kannauj. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n191. **^** Pollock, Sheldon (2006). *The Language of the Gods in the World of Men: Sanskrit, Culture, and Power in Premodern India*.

However, the Maratha authority in the north was re-established within a decade under Peshwa Madhavrao I.[339]\n\n\nUnder Madhavrao I, the strongest knights were granted semi-autonomy, creating a confederacy of United Maratha states under the Gaekwads of Baroda, the Holkars of Indore and Malwa, the Scindias of Gwalior and Ujjain, the Bhonsales of Nagpur and the Puars of Dhar and Dewas. In 1775, the East India Company intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in Pune, which led to the First Anglo-Maratha War, resulting in a Maratha victory.[340] The Marathas remained a major power in India until their defeat in the Second and Third Anglo-Maratha Wars (1805–1818).\n\n\n\n### Sikh Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sikh Empire\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Antonova, K.A.; Bongard-Levin, G.; Kotovsky, G.

During this age India's economy expanded, relative peace was maintained and arts were patronized. This period witnessed the further development of Indo-Islamic architecture;[305][306] the growth of Marathas and Sikhs enabled them to rule significant regions of India in the waning days of the Mughal empire.[14] With the discovery of the Cape route in the 1500s, the first Europeans to arrive by sea and establish themselves, were the Portuguese in Goa and Bombay.[307]\n\n\n\n### Mughal Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mughal Empire\n\nSee also: Bengal Subah, Muslin trade in Bengal, Mughal architecture, Army of the Mughal Empire, Mughal clothing, and Mughal painting\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> Modern human beings—Homo sapiens—originated in Africa.

In particular, the partition of Punjab and Bengal led to rioting between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs in these provinces and spread to other nearby regions, leaving some 500,000 dead. The police and army units were largely ineffective. The British officers were gone, and the units were beginning to tolerate if not actually indulge in violence against their religious enemies.[416][417][418] Also, this period saw one of the largest mass migrations anywhere in modern history, with a total of 12 million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims moving between the newly created nations of India and Pakistan (which gained independence on 15 and 14 August 1947 respectively).[417] In 1971, Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan and East Bengal, seceded from Pakistan.[419]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHistory of Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Afghanistan\n* Armenia\n* Azerbaijan\n* Bahrain\n* Bangladesh\n* Bhutan\n* Brunei\n* Cambodia\n* China\n* Cyprus\n* East Timor (Timor-Leste)\n* Egypt\n* Georgia\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Iran\n* Iraq\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Jordan\n* Kazakhstan\n* North Korea\n* South Korea\n* Kuwait\n* Kyrgyzstan\n* Laos\n* Lebanon\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Mongolia\n* Myanmar\n* Nepal\n* Oman\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Qatar\n* Russia\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Singapore\n* Sri Lanka\n* Syria\n* Tajikistan\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n* Turkmenistan\n* United Arab Emirates\n* Uzbekistan\n* Vietnam\n* Yemen\n |\n| States withlimited recognition | * Abkhazia\n* Northern Cyprus\n* Palestine\n* South Ossetia\n* Taiwan\n |\n| Dependencies andother territories | * British Indian Ocean Territory\n* Christmas Island\n* Cocos (Keeling) Islands\n* Hong Kong\n* Macau\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Asia portal\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nIndia topics\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| History\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n163. **^** Barpujari, H.K., ed.

The Indian Penal Code came into being.[368] In education, Thomas Babington Macaulay had made schooling a priority for the Raj in 1835 and succeeded in implementing the use of English for instruction. By 1890 some 60,000 Indians had matriculated.[369] The Indian economy grew at about 1% per year from 1880 to 1920, and the population also grew at 1%. However, from 1910s Indian private industry began to grow significantly. India built a modern railway system in the late 19th century which was the fourth largest in the world.[370] Historians have been bitterly divided on issues of economic history, with the Nationalist school arguing that India was poorer due to British rule.[371]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the aftermath, all power was transferred from the British East India Company to the British Crown, which began to administer most of India as provinces. The Crown controlled the company's lands directly and had considerable indirect influence over the rest of India, which consisted of the Princely states ruled by local royal families. There were officially 565 princely states in 1947, but only 21 had actual state governments, and only three were large (Mysore, Hyderabad, and Kashmir). They were absorbed into the independent nation in 1947–48.[367]\n\n\n\n### British Raj (1858–1947)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: British Raj\n\nBritish Raj\n![](image)\nThe British Indian Empire in 1909.

However, historians are divided over the causes of its rise. Probable reasons include a \"clash of interests of the Indian people with British interests\",[402] \"racial discriminations\",[403] and \"the revelation of India's past\".[404]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Mughal Empire reached the zenith of its territorial expanse during the reign of Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707), under whose reign the proto-industrialization[317] led to India surpassing Qing China as the world's largest economy.[318][319] Aurangzeb was less tolerant than his predecessors, reintroducing the *jizya* tax and destroying several historical temples, while at the same time building more Hindu temples than he destroyed,[320] employing significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors, and advancing administrators based on ability rather than religion.[321] However, he is often blamed for the erosion of the tolerant syncretic tradition of his predecessors, as well as increasing religious controversy and centralisation.

Dissatisfaction with company rule in India led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857. India was afterwards ruled directly by the British Crown, in the British Raj.

It started from the end of slavery in 1833 and continued until 1920. This resulted in the development of a large Indian diaspora that spread from the Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean and the growth of large Indo-Caribbean and Indo-African populations.\n\n\n\n## Late modern and contemporary period (after c. 1850 CE)[edit]\n\n\n### Rebellion of 1857 and its consequences[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian Rebellion of 1857\n\n* ![Charles Canning, the Governor-General of India during the rebellion.](image)\n\nCharles Canning, the Governor-General of India during the rebellion.\n* ![Lord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856, who devised the Doctrine of Lapse.](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ![Rang Ghar, built by Pramatta Singha in Ahom kingdom's capital Rangpur, is one of the earliest pavilions of outdoor stadia in the Indian subcontinent.](image)\n\nRang Ghar, built by Pramatta Singha in Ahom kingdom's capital Rangpur, is one of the earliest pavilions of outdoor stadia in the Indian subcontinent.\n* ![Chittor Fort is the largest fort on the Indian subcontinent; it is one of the six Hill Forts of Rajasthan.](image)\n\nChittor Fort is the largest fort on the Indian subcontinent; it is one of the six Hill Forts of Rajasthan.\n* ![Ranakpur Jain temple was built in the 15th century with the support of the Rajput state of Mewar.](image)\n\nRanakpur Jain temple was built in the 15th century with the support of the Rajput state of Mewar.\n* ![Gol Gumbaz built by the Bijapur Sultanate, has the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine Hagia Sophia.](image)\n\nGol Gumbaz built by the Bijapur Sultanate, has the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine Hagia Sophia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Maharashtra\n* Uttar Pradesh\n* Punjab\n* Odisha\n* Sindh\n* South India\n* Tamil Nadu\n* Tibet\n |\n| Specialised histories\n* Agriculture\n* Architecture\n* Coinage\n* Demographics\n* Dynasties\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Indology\n* Influence on Southeast Asia\n* Language\n* Literature\n* Maritime\n* Metallurgy\n* Military\n* Partition of India\n* Pakistan studies\n* Philosophy\n* Religion\n* Science and technology\n* Timeline\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAkbar married a Rajput princess, Mariam-uz-Zamani, and they had a son, Jahangir (r. 1605–1627).[310] Jahangir followed his father's policy. The Mughal dynasty ruled most of the Indian subcontinent by 1600. The reign of Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) was the golden age of Mughal architecture. He erected several large monuments, the most famous of which is the Taj Mahal at Agra.\n\n\nIt was one of the largest empires to have existed in the Indian subcontinent,[311] and surpassed China to become the world's largest economic power, controlling 24.4% of the world economy,[312] and the world leader in manufacturing,[313] producing 25% of global industrial output.[314] The economic and demographic upsurge was stimulated by Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production,[315] and a relatively high degree of urbanisation.[316]\n\n\n\nOther Mughal UNESCO World Heritage Sites\n* ![The Agra Fort showing the river Yamuna and the Taj Mahal in the background](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n129. **^** Stadtner, Donald (1975). \"A Śuṅga Capital from Vidiśā\". *Artibus Asiae*. **37** (1/2): 101–104. doi:10.2307/3250214.

These Mahajanapadas evolved and flourished in a belt stretching from Gandhara in the northwest to Bengal in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent and included parts of the trans-Vindhyan region.[89] Ancient Buddhist texts, like the *Aṅguttara Nikāya*,[90] make frequent reference to these sixteen great kingdoms and republics—Anga, Assaka, Avanti, Chedi, Gandhara, Kashi, Kamboja, Kosala, Kuru, Magadha, Malla, Matsya (or Machcha), Panchala, Surasena, Vṛji, and Vatsa. This period saw the second major rise of urbanism in India after the Indus Valley Civilisation.[91]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Geology | * Fossil Parks\n* Geology of India\n* Indian Plate\n |\n| Heritage | * National Geological Monuments of India\n* Sacred groves of India\n* Sacred mountains of India\n* Sacred rivers of India\n* Stones of India\n |\n| Environment | * Biogeographic classification\n* Biosphere reserves\n* Climate\n* Climate change\n* Earthquakes\n* Ecoregions\n* Environmental issues\n* Fauna\n* Forests\n* Flora\n* Geology\n* National parks\n* Protected areas\n* Wildlife\n* sanctuaries\n |\n| Landforms | * Beaches\n* Canals\n* Coasts\n* Desert\n* ECZ\n* Extreme points\n* Glaciers\n* Highest point by states\n* Islands\n* Lakes\n* Mountains\n* Mountain passes\n* Plains\n\t+ Indo-Gangetic\n\t+ Eastern coastal\n\t+ Western coastal\n* Rivers\n* Valleys\n* Volcanoes\n* Waterfalls\n |\n| Regions | * Central\n* East\n* North\n\t+ Northwest\n* Northeast\n* South\n\t+ Southwest\n\t+ Southeast\n* West\n |\n| Subdivisions | * Autonomous administrative divisions\n* Borders\n* Towns\n* Cities\n* Districts\n* Municipalities\n* States and union territories\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEngraving from *The Graphic*, October 1877, showing the plight of animals as well as humans in Bellary district, Madras Presidency, British India during the Great Famine of 1876–1878.\n* ![Government famine relief, Ahmedabad, India, during the Indian famine of 1899–1900.](image)\n\nGovernment famine relief, Ahmedabad, India, during the Indian famine of 1899–1900.\n* ![A picture of orphans who survived the Bengal famine of 1943](image)\n\nA picture of orphans who survived the Bengal famine of 1943\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe time between the Maurya Empire in the 3rd century BCE and the end of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century CE is referred to as the \"Classical\" period of India.[125] The Gupta Empire (4th–6th century) is regarded as the \"Golden Age\" of Hinduism, although a host of kingdoms ruled over India in these centuries.

Following the Dutch, the British—who set up in the west coast port of Surat in 1619—and the French both established trading outposts in India. Although continental European powers controlled various coastal regions of southern and eastern India during the ensuing century, they eventually lost all their territories in India to the British, with the exception of the French outposts of Pondichéry and Chandernagore,[357] and the Portuguese colonies of Goa, Daman and Diu.[358]\n\n\n\n### East India Company rule in India[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: East India Company and Company rule in India\n\nIndia under East India Company rule\n![](image)\nIndia in 1765 and 1805 showing East India Company Territories in pink.\n![](image)\nIndia in 1837 and 1857 showing East India Company (pink) and other territories\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n368. **^** \"Law Commission of India – Early Beginnings\"\n369. **^** Suresh Chandra Ghosh (1995). \"Bentinck, Macaulay and the introduction of English education in India\". *History of Education*. **24** (1): 17–25. doi:10.1080/0046760950240102.\n370. **^** I.D.

Especially focused in the Central Ganges plain but also spreading across vast areas of the northern and central Indian subcontinent, this culture is characterized by the emergence of large cities with massive fortifications, significant population growth, increased social stratification, wide-ranging trade networks, construction of public architecture and water channels, specialized craft industries, a system of weights, punch-marked coins, and the introduction of writing in the form of Brahmi and Kharosthi scripts.[95][96] The language of the gentry at that time was Sanskrit, while the languages of the general population of northern India are referred to as Prakrits.\n\n\nMany of the sixteen kingdoms had coalesced into four major ones by 500/400 BCE, by the time of Gautama Buddha. These four were Vatsa, Avanti, Kosala, and Magadha.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Early Magadha dynasties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the fall of the Maratha Empire, many Maratha dynasties and states became vassals in a subsidiary alliance with the British. With the decline of the Sikh Empire, after the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1846, under the terms of the Treaty of Amritsar, the British government sold Kashmir to Maharaja Gulab Singh and the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, the second-largest princely state in British India, was created by the Dogra dynasty.[349][350] While in Eastern and Northeastern India, the Hindu and Buddhist states of Cooch Behar Kingdom, Twipra Kingdom and Kingdom of Sikkim were annexed by the British and made vassal princely state.\n\n\nAfter the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Polygar states emerged in Southern India; and managed to weather invasions and flourished until the Polygar Wars, where they were defeated by the British East India Company forces.[351] Around the 18th century, the Kingdom of Nepal was formed by Rajput rulers.[352]\n\n\n\n### European exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial India\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Indian cultural influence (Greater India)\n![](image)Timeline of Indian history\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n399. **^** \"Information about the Indian National Congress\". *open.ac.uk*.

The Maurya Empire would collapse in 185 BCE, on the assassination of the then-emperor Brihadratha by his general Pushyamitra Shunga. Shunga would go on to form the Shunga Empire in the north and northeast of the subcontinent, while the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom would claim the northwest and found the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties, including the Gupta Empire, in the 4th to 6th centuries CE. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the Classical or Golden Age of India. Aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and religion spread to much of Asia, which led to the establishment of Indianised kingdoms in the region, forming Greater India.[4][5] The most significant event between the 7th and 11th century was the Tripartite struggle centred on Kannauj. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n191. **^** Pollock, Sheldon (2006). *The Language of the Gods in the World of Men: Sanskrit, Culture, and Power in Premodern India*.

In 1775, the East India Company intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in Pune, which led to the First Anglo-Maratha War, resulting in a Maratha victory.[340] The Marathas remained a major power in India until their defeat in the Second and Third Anglo-Maratha Wars (1805–1818).\n\n\n\n### Sikh Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sikh Empire\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Antonova, K.A.; Bongard-Levin, G.; Kotovsky, G.

During this age India's economy expanded, relative peace was maintained and arts were patronized. This period witnessed the further development of Indo-Islamic architecture;[305][306] the growth of Marathas and Sikhs enabled them to rule significant regions of India in the waning days of the Mughal empire.[14] With the discovery of the Cape route in the 1500s, the first Europeans to arrive by sea and establish themselves, were the Portuguese in Goa and Bombay.[307]\n\n\n\n### Mughal Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mughal Empire\n\nSee also: Bengal Subah, Muslin trade in Bengal, Mughal architecture, Army of the Mughal Empire, Mughal clothing, and Mughal painting\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> Modern human beings—Homo sapiens—originated in Africa.

In particular, the partition of Punjab and Bengal led to rioting between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs in these provinces and spread to other nearby regions, leaving some 500,000 dead. The police and army units were largely ineffective. The British officers were gone, and the units were beginning to tolerate if not actually indulge in violence against their religious enemies.[416][417][418] Also, this period saw one of the largest mass migrations anywhere in modern history, with a total of 12 million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims moving between the newly created nations of India and Pakistan (which gained independence on 15 and 14 August 1947 respectively).[417] In 1971, Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan and East Bengal, seceded from Pakistan.[419]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHistory of Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Afghanistan\n* Armenia\n* Azerbaijan\n* Bahrain\n* Bangladesh\n* Bhutan\n* Brunei\n* Cambodia\n* China\n* Cyprus\n* East Timor (Timor-Leste)\n* Egypt\n* Georgia\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Iran\n* Iraq\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Jordan\n* Kazakhstan\n* North Korea\n* South Korea\n* Kuwait\n* Kyrgyzstan\n* Laos\n* Lebanon\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Mongolia\n* Myanmar\n* Nepal\n* Oman\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Qatar\n* Russia\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Singapore\n* Sri Lanka\n* Syria\n* Tajikistan\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n* Turkmenistan\n* United Arab Emirates\n* Uzbekistan\n* Vietnam\n* Yemen\n |\n| States withlimited recognition | * Abkhazia\n* Northern Cyprus\n* Palestine\n* South Ossetia\n* Taiwan\n |\n| Dependencies andother territories | * British Indian Ocean Territory\n* Christmas Island\n* Cocos (Keeling) Islands\n* Hong Kong\n* Macau\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Asia portal\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nIndia topics\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| History\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n163. **^** Barpujari, H.K., ed.

It was centred near the city of Muzaffarabad, and also affected nearby Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and some areas of Jammu and Kashmir, India. It registered a moment magnitude of 7.6 and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (*Extreme*). The earthquake was also felt in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, India and the Xinjiang region. The severity of the damage caused by the earthquake is attributed to severe upthrust. Over 86,000 people died, a similar number were injured, and millions were displaced. It is considered the deadliest earthquake in South Asia, surpassing the 1935 Quetta earthquake.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Earthquake[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map depicting regional tectonic plates\nKashmir lies in the area of collision of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The geological activity born out of this collision, also responsible for the birth of the Himalayan mountain range, is the cause of unstable seismicity in the region. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) measured its magnitude as a minimum of 7.6 on the moment magnitude scale, with its epicentre about 19 km (12 mi) northeast of Muzaffarabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, a region under the state of Pakistan and 100 km (62 mi) north-northeast of the national capital Islamabad.\n\n\n\n### Intensity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)USGS Shakemap for the event\nThe earthquake had a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of XI (*Extreme*) evaluated in an area around the epicentre,[2] between the towns of Muzaffarabad and Balakot. It was also assigned XI on the Environmental Seismic Intensity scale. Field surveys of heavy damage to buildings and other structures in Balakot determined that the Modified Mercalli intensity exceeded X. At Muzaffarabad, the intensity peaked at VIII–IX (*Severe–Violent*). Intensity VII–VIII (*Very strong–Severe*) was determined in the areas south of Muzaffarabad.[9]\n\n\nThe maximum intensity in Bharat was VIII (*Destructive*) on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale (MSK), and was felt at Uri. MSK VII was felt in Kupwara and Baramulla. In Srinagar, the earthquake was felt with an MSK intensity of V. At areas where the seismic intensity was lower, collapses were documented.[9] The earthquake was felt throughout central Asia, and as far away as Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Minor shaking was felt in Almaty, Kazakhstan.[10]\n\n\n\n### Aftershocks[edit]\n\n\nThere were many secondary earthquakes in the region, mainly to the northwest of the original epicentre. A series of strong aftershocks occurred near Muzaffarabad.[11] As of 27 October 2005[12] there had been more than 978 aftershocks with a magnitude of 4.0 and above that continued to occur daily. Since then, measurements from satellites have shown that mountain parts directly above the epicenter have risen by a few meters, giving ample proof that the Himalayas are still being formed and growing, and that this earthquake was a consequence of that.[13] By the end of 2005, a total of 1,778 aftershocks were recorded.

In AJK, the three main districts were badly affected and Muzaffarabad, the state capital of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, was hardest hit in terms of casualties and destruction. Hospitals, schools, and rescue services including police and armed forces were paralysed. There was virtually no infrastructure and communication was badly affected. More than 70% of all casualties were estimated to have occurred in Muzaffarabad. Bagh, the second-most-affected district, accounted for 15% of the total casualties.[*citation needed*] In Islamabad, the Margalla Towers, an apartment complex in sector F-10, collapsed resulting in the deaths of an estimated 70 inhabitants.[15] One Egyptian and two Japanese were among the dead there.[16]\n\n\nThe Pakistani government's official death toll as of November 2005 stood at 87,350 although it is estimated that the death toll could have reached over 100,000. Approximately 138,000 were injured and over 3.5 million rendered homeless. According to government figures, 19,000 children died in the earthquake, most of them in widespread collapses of school buildings. The earthquake affected more than 500,000 families. In addition, approximately 250,000 farm animals died due to the collapse of stone barns, and more than 500,000 large animals required immediate shelter from the harsh winter.[*citation needed*] About 200 soldiers were also killed in the epicentral area.[16]\n\n\nAs Saturday is a normal school day in the region, most students were at schools when the earthquake struck. Many were buried under collapsed school buildings. In Mansehra District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one collapsing school killed 350 students, while another school in the same district killed an additional fifty students.[16] Many people were also trapped in their homes and because it was the month of Ramadan, most people were taking a nap after their pre-dawn meal and did not have time to escape. Reports indicate that entire towns and villages were completely wiped out in northern Pakistan, with other surrounding areas also suffering severe damage.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\"...a second, massive wave of death will happen if we do not step up our efforts now\", Kofi Annan said on 20 October with reference to the thousand remote villages in which people \"are in need of medical attention, food, clean water and shelter and the 120,000 survivors that have not yet been reached.\"[17]\nAccording to Pakistan's Interior Minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz \"made the appeal to survivors\" on 26 October to come down to valleys and cities for relief,[18] because bad weather, mountainous terrain, landslides and blocked roads are making it difficult for relief workers to reach each house and the winter snows are imminent.\"\n\n\n\n### India[edit]\n\n\nAt least 1,350 people were killed and 6,266 injured in Jammu and Kashmir, India.[19][20][21] In Uri there were over 150 deaths.[16] The tremors were reportedly felt as far away as Delhi and Punjab.\n\n\n\n### Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\nFour deaths were reported in Afghanistan, including a young girl who died in Jalalabad, after a wall collapsed on her. The quake was felt in Kabul, but the effects were minimal there.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Response[edit]\n\n\nMain article: International response to the 2005 Kashmir earthquake\n\n![](image)Pakistani soldiers carry tents away from a U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook helicopter\nThe national and international humanitarian response to the crisis was extensive. In the initial phases of response, the Pakistan Medical corps, Corps of Engineers, Army aviation and a large number of infantry units played important roles. Lt. Gen Afzal, Maj. Gen. Imtiaz, and Maj. Gen Javid were the leaders of their formations. Maj. Gen Farrukh Seir was in charge of foreign relief co-ordination. The relief work in the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir was led by IAS officers of the state administration, Bashir Runyal and Jaipal Singh Law. In early 2006, the Government of Pakistan organized a donors' conference to raise money for reconstruction and development of the area. A total of $6.2 billion was pledged and a large amount of the money was delivered in terms of services of international NGOs with high pay scales. The rest of the money pledged, which was given to the Government of Pakistan for reconstruction and development, was used by a reconstruction authority called Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority. \n\n\nWell over US$5.4 billion (400 billion Pakistani rupees)[22] in aid arrived from all around the world. US Marine and Army helicopters stationed in neighbouring Afghanistan quickly flew aid into the devastated region along with five CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the Royal Air Force that were deployed from the United Kingdom. Five crossing points were opened on the Line of Control (LOC), between India and Pakistan, to facilitate the flow of humanitarian and medical aid to the affected region, and aid teams from different parts of Pakistan and around the world came to the region to assist in relief efforts.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Pakistan portal\n* ![](image)Earth sciences portal\n\n\n* *Meena* - \"Life Smiled Again\"\n* Disaster Management Act, 2005\n* October 2015 Hindu Kush earthquake\n* 2019 Kashmir earthquake\n* List of earthquakes in 2005\n* List of earthquakes in Pakistan\n* List of earthquakes in India\n* List of earthquakes in Afghanistan\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ISC (2014), *ISC-GEM Global Instrumental Earthquake Catalogue (1900–2009)*, Version 1.05, International Seismological Centre\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Zahid Ali; Muhammad Qaisar; Tariq Mahmood; Muhammad Ali Shah; Talat Iqbal; Leonello Serva; Alessandro M.

It was centred near the city of Muzaffarabad, and also affected nearby Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and some areas of Jammu and Kashmir, India. It registered a moment magnitude of 7.6 and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (*Extreme*). The earthquake was also felt in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, India and the Xinjiang region. The severity of the damage caused by the earthquake is attributed to severe upthrust. Over 86,000 people died, a similar number were injured, and millions were displaced. It is considered the deadliest earthquake in South Asia, surpassing the 1935 Quetta earthquake.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Earthquake[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map depicting regional tectonic plates\nKashmir lies in the area of collision of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The geological activity born out of this collision, also responsible for the birth of the Himalayan mountain range, is the cause of unstable seismicity in the region. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) measured its magnitude as a minimum of 7.6 on the moment magnitude scale, with its epicentre about 19 km (12 mi) northeast of Muzaffarabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, a region under the state of Pakistan and 100 km (62 mi) north-northeast of the national capital Islamabad.\n\n\n\n### Intensity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)USGS Shakemap for the event\nThe earthquake had a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of XI (*Extreme*) evaluated in an area around the epicentre,[2] between the towns of Muzaffarabad and Balakot. It was also assigned XI on the Environmental Seismic Intensity scale. Field surveys of heavy damage to buildings and other structures in Balakot determined that the Modified Mercalli intensity exceeded X. At Muzaffarabad, the intensity peaked at VIII–IX (*Severe–Violent*). Intensity VII–VIII (*Very strong–Severe*) was determined in the areas south of Muzaffarabad.[9]\n\n\nThe maximum intensity in Bharat was VIII (*Destructive*) on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale (MSK), and was felt at Uri. MSK VII was felt in Kupwara and Baramulla. In Srinagar, the earthquake was felt with an MSK intensity of V. At areas where the seismic intensity was lower, collapses were documented.[9] The earthquake was felt throughout central Asia, and as far away as Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Minor shaking was felt in Almaty, Kazakhstan.[10]\n\n\n\n### Aftershocks[edit]\n\n\nThere were many secondary earthquakes in the region, mainly to the northwest of the original epicentre. A series of strong aftershocks occurred near Muzaffarabad.[11] As of 27 October 2005[12] there had been more than 978 aftershocks with a magnitude of 4.0 and above that continued to occur daily. Since then, measurements from satellites have shown that mountain parts directly above the epicenter have risen by a few meters, giving ample proof that the Himalayas are still being formed and growing, and that this earthquake was a consequence of that.[13] By the end of 2005, a total of 1,778 aftershocks were recorded.

In AJK, the three main districts were badly affected and Muzaffarabad, the state capital of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, was hardest hit in terms of casualties and destruction. Hospitals, schools, and rescue services including police and armed forces were paralysed. There was virtually no infrastructure and communication was badly affected. More than 70% of all casualties were estimated to have occurred in Muzaffarabad. Bagh, the second-most-affected district, accounted for 15% of the total casualties.[*citation needed*] In Islamabad, the Margalla Towers, an apartment complex in sector F-10, collapsed resulting in the deaths of an estimated 70 inhabitants.[15] One Egyptian and two Japanese were among the dead there.[16]\n\n\nThe Pakistani government's official death toll as of November 2005 stood at 87,350 although it is estimated that the death toll could have reached over 100,000. Approximately 138,000 were injured and over 3.5 million rendered homeless. According to government figures, 19,000 children died in the earthquake, most of them in widespread collapses of school buildings. The earthquake affected more than 500,000 families. In addition, approximately 250,000 farm animals died due to the collapse of stone barns, and more than 500,000 large animals required immediate shelter from the harsh winter.[*citation needed*] About 200 soldiers were also killed in the epicentral area.[16]\n\n\nAs Saturday is a normal school day in the region, most students were at schools when the earthquake struck. Many were buried under collapsed school buildings. In Mansehra District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one collapsing school killed 350 students, while another school in the same district killed an additional fifty students.[16] Many people were also trapped in their homes and because it was the month of Ramadan, most people were taking a nap after their pre-dawn meal and did not have time to escape. Reports indicate that entire towns and villages were completely wiped out in northern Pakistan, with other surrounding areas also suffering severe damage.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\"...a second, massive wave of death will happen if we do not step up our efforts now\", Kofi Annan said on 20 October with reference to the thousand remote villages in which people \"are in need of medical attention, food, clean water and shelter and the 120,000 survivors that have not yet been reached.\"[17]\nAccording to Pakistan's Interior Minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz \"made the appeal to survivors\" on 26 October to come down to valleys and cities for relief,[18] because bad weather, mountainous terrain, landslides and blocked roads are making it difficult for relief workers to reach each house and the winter snows are imminent.\"\n\n\n\n### India[edit]\n\n\nAt least 1,350 people were killed and 6,266 injured in Jammu and Kashmir, India.[19][20][21] In Uri there were over 150 deaths.[16] The tremors were reportedly felt as far away as Delhi and Punjab.\n\n\n\n### Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\nFour deaths were reported in Afghanistan, including a young girl who died in Jalalabad, after a wall collapsed on her. The quake was felt in Kabul, but the effects were minimal there.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Response[edit]\n\n\nMain article: International response to the 2005 Kashmir earthquake\n\n![](image)Pakistani soldiers carry tents away from a U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook helicopter\nThe national and international humanitarian response to the crisis was extensive. In the initial phases of response, the Pakistan Medical corps, Corps of Engineers, Army aviation and a large number of infantry units played important roles. Lt. Gen Afzal, Maj. Gen. Imtiaz, and Maj. Gen Javid were the leaders of their formations. Maj. Gen Farrukh Seir was in charge of foreign relief co-ordination. The relief work in the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir was led by IAS officers of the state administration, Bashir Runyal and Jaipal Singh Law. In early 2006, the Government of Pakistan organized a donors' conference to raise money for reconstruction and development of the area. A total of $6.2 billion was pledged and a large amount of the money was delivered in terms of services of international NGOs with high pay scales. The rest of the money pledged, which was given to the Government of Pakistan for reconstruction and development, was used by a reconstruction authority called Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority. \n\n\nWell over US$5.4 billion (400 billion Pakistani rupees)[22] in aid arrived from all around the world. US Marine and Army helicopters stationed in neighbouring Afghanistan quickly flew aid into the devastated region along with five CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the Royal Air Force that were deployed from the United Kingdom. Five crossing points were opened on the Line of Control (LOC), between India and Pakistan, to facilitate the flow of humanitarian and medical aid to the affected region, and aid teams from different parts of Pakistan and around the world came to the region to assist in relief efforts.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Pakistan portal\n* ![](image)Earth sciences portal\n\n\n* *Meena* - \"Life Smiled Again\"\n* Disaster Management Act, 2005\n* October 2015 Hindu Kush earthquake\n* 2019 Kashmir earthquake\n* List of earthquakes in 2005\n* List of earthquakes in Pakistan\n* List of earthquakes in India\n* List of earthquakes in Afghanistan\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ISC (2014), *ISC-GEM Global Instrumental Earthquake Catalogue (1900–2009)*, Version 1.05, International Seismological Centre\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Zahid Ali; Muhammad Qaisar; Tariq Mahmood; Muhammad Ali Shah; Talat Iqbal; Leonello Serva; Alessandro M.

The undersea megathrust earthquake, known by the scientific community as the **Sumatra–Andaman earthquake**,[10][11] was caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma Plate and the Indian Plate, and reached a Mercalli intensity up to IX in some areas.\n\n\nA massive tsunami with waves up to 30 m (100 ft) high, known in some countries as the **Boxing Day Tsunami** after the Boxing Day holiday, devastated communities along the surrounding coasts of the Indian Ocean, killing an estimated 227,898 people in 14 countries in one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. The direct results caused major disruptions to living conditions and commerce in coastal provinces of surrounded countries, including Aceh (Indonesia), Sri Lanka, Tamil Nadu (India) and Khao Lak (Thailand). Banda Aceh reported the largest number of deaths. It remains the deadliest natural disaster of the 21st century.[12]\n\n\nIt was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Asia, the most powerful earthquake in the 21st century, and at least the third most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the world since modern seismography began in 1900. It had the longest duration of faulting ever observed, between eight and ten minutes.[13] It caused the planet to vibrate as much as 10 mm (0.4 in),[14] and also remotely triggered earthquakes as far away as Alaska.[15] Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Sumatra.[16] The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response, with donations totalling more than US$14 billion[17] (equivalent to US$23 billion in 2023 currency).\n\n\n\n\n## Earthquake[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2004 Indian Oceanearthquake and tsunami |\n| --- |\n| ![A sped-up animated graphic of Earth that shows tsunami waves as they ripple across the ocean, away from the earthquake epicenter.](image) |\n| Countries affected |\n| * India\n* Indonesia\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Myanmar\n* Somalia\n* Sri Lanka\n* Thailand\n |\n| * Indirect: Finland\n* Norway\n |\n| Humanitarian response |\n| * Classic Response\n* Football for Hope\n* Music for Relief\n* Reach Out to Asia\n* Rugby Aid\n* Tsunami Relief Cardiff\n* UK Radio Aid\n* WaveAid\n* World Cricket Tsunami Appeal\n |\n| \nMilitary operations |\n| * *Garron*\n* *Sumatra Assist*\n* *Unified Assistance*\n |\n| \nRelated topics |\n| * Library damage\n* Sri Lanka train wreck\n\n---\n |\n| * Category\n* Commons\n* Timeline\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n![](image)USGS Shakemap for the event\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was initially documented as having a moment magnitude of 8.8. In February 2005, scientists revised the estimate of the magnitude to 9.0.[18] Although the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has accepted these new numbers, the United States Geological Survey has, as of 2022, so far not changed its estimate of 9.1.[19] A 2006 study estimated a magnitude of Mw 9.1–9.3; Hiroo Kanamori of the California Institute of Technology estimates that Mw 9.2 is representative of the earthquake's size.[20]\n\n\nThe hypocentre of the main earthquake was approximately 160 km (100 mi) off the western coast of northern Sumatra, in the Indian Ocean just north of Simeulue island at a depth of 30 km (19 mi) below mean sea level (initially reported as 10 km or 6.2 mi). The northern section of the Sunda megathrust ruptured over a length of 1,300 km (810 mi).[16] The earthquake (followed by the tsunami) was felt in Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.[21] Splay faults, or secondary \"pop up faults\", caused long, narrow parts of the seafloor to pop up in seconds. This quickly elevated the height and increased the speed of waves, destroying the nearby Indonesian town of Lhoknga.[22]\n\n\nIndonesia lies between the Pacific Ring of Fire along the north-eastern islands adjacent to New Guinea, and the Alpide belt that runs along the south and west from Sumatra, Java, Bali, Flores to Timor. The 2002 Sumatra earthquake is believed to have been a foreshock, preceding the main event by over two years.[23]\n\n\n\n### Historical comparisons[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of megathrust earthquakes\n\nGreat earthquakes, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, are associated with megathrust events in subduction zones. Their seismic moments can account for a significant fraction of the global seismic moment across century-scale periods. Of all the moment released by earthquakes in the 100 years from 1906 through 2005, roughly one eighth was due to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.[24] This quake, together with the Great Alaskan earthquake (1964) and the Great Chilean earthquake (1960), account for almost half of the total moment.[24][25]\n\n\nSince 1900, the only earthquakes recorded with a greater magnitude were the 1960 Valdivia earthquake (magnitude 9.5) and the 1964 Alaska earthquake in Prince William Sound (magnitude 9.2). The only other recorded earthquakes of magnitude 9.0 or greater were off Kamchatka, Russia, on 5 November 1952 (magnitude 9.0) and Tōhoku, Japan (magnitude 9.1) in March 2011. Each of these megathrust earthquakes also spawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean. In comparison to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the death toll from these earthquakes and tsunamis was significantly lower, primarily because of the lower population density along the coasts near affected areas.[10]\n\n\nComparisons with earlier earthquakes are difficult, as earthquake strength were not measured systematically until the 1930s.[26] However, historical earthquake strength can sometimes be estimated by examining historical descriptions of the damage caused, and the geological records of the areas where they occurred.[27] Some examples of significant historical megathrust earthquakes are the 1868 Arica earthquake in Peru and the 1700 Cascadia earthquake in western North America.\n\n\n\n### Tectonic plates[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Plate tectonics\n\n![](image)Epicentre and associated aftershocks\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was unusually large in geographical and geological extent. An estimated 1,600 km (1,000 mi) of fault surface slipped (or ruptured) about 15 m (50 ft) along the subduction zone where the Indian Plate slides under (or subducts) the overriding Burma Plate. The slip did not happen instantaneously but took place in two phases over several minutes:\nSeismographic and acoustic data indicate that the first phase involved a rupture about 400 km (250 mi) long and 100 km (60 mi) wide, 30 km (19 mi) beneath the sea bed—the largest rupture ever known to have been caused by an earthquake. The rupture proceeded at about 2.8 km/s (1.74 mi/s; 10,100 km/h; 6,260 mph), beginning off the coast of Aceh and proceeding north-westerly over about 100 seconds.\nAfter a pause of about another 100 seconds, the rupture continued northwards towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The northern rupture occurred more slowly than in the south, at about 2.1 km/s (1.3 mi/s; 7,600 km/h; 4,700 mph), continuing north for another five minutes to a plate boundary where the fault type changes from subduction to strike-slip (the two plates slide past one another in opposite directions).\n\n\nThe Indian Plate is part of the great Indo-Australian Plate, which underlies the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, and is moving north-east at an average of 60 mm/a (0.075 in/Ms). The India Plate meets the Burma Plate (which is considered a portion of the great Eurasian Plate) at the Sunda Trench. At this point, the India Plate subducts beneath the Burma Plate, which carries the Nicobar Islands, the Andaman Islands, and northern Sumatra. The India Plate sinks deeper and deeper beneath the Burma Plate until the increasing temperature and pressure drive volatiles out of the subducting plate. These volatiles rise into the overlying plate, causing partial melting and the formation of magma. The rising magma intrudes into the crust above and exits the Earth's crust through volcanoes in the form of a volcanic arc. The volcanic activity that results as the Indo-Australian Plate subducts the Eurasian Plate has created the Sunda Arc.\n\n\nAs well as the sideways movement between the plates, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake resulted in a rise of the seafloor by several metres, displacing an estimated 30 km3 (7.2 cu mi) of water and triggering devastating tsunami waves. The waves radiated outwards along the entire 1,600 km (1,000 mi) length of the rupture (acting as a line source). This greatly increased the geographical area over which the waves were observed, reaching as far as Mexico, Chile, and the Arctic. The raising of the seafloor significantly reduced the capacity of the Indian Ocean, producing a permanent rise in the global sea level by an estimated 0.1 mm (0.004 in).[28]\n\n\n\n### Aftershocks and other earthquakes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of earthquakes in Indonesia and List of earthquakes in 2004\n\n![](image)Initial earthquake and aftershocks measuring greater than 4.0 Mw  from 26 December 2004 to 10 January 2005\n![](image)Aftershocks of 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake\nNumerous aftershocks were reported off the Andaman Islands, the Nicobar Islands and the region of the original epicentre in the hours and days that followed. The magnitude 8.7 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, which originated off the coast of the Sumatran island of Nias, is not considered an aftershock, despite its proximity to the epicentre, and was most likely triggered by stress changes associated with the 2004 event.[29] The earthquake produced its own aftershocks (some registering a magnitude of as high as 6.1) and presently ranks as the third-largest earthquake ever recorded on the moment magnitude or Richter magnitude scale.\n\n\nOther aftershocks of up to magnitude 6.6 continued to shake the region daily for three or four months.[30] As well as continuing aftershocks, the energy released by the original earthquake continued to make its presence felt well after the event. A week after the earthquake, its reverberations could still be measured, providing valuable scientific data about the Earth's interior.\n\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake came just three days after a magnitude 8.1 earthquake in the sub-antarctic Auckland Islands, an uninhabited region west of New Zealand, and Macquarie Island to Australia's north. This is unusual since earthquakes of magnitude eight or more occur only about once per year on average.[31] The U.S. Geological Survey sees no evidence of a causal relationship between these events.[32]\n\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is thought to have triggered activity in both Leuser Mountain[33] and Mount Talang,[34] volcanoes in Aceh along the same range of peaks, while the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake had sparked activity in Lake Toba, an ancient crater in Sumatra.[35]\n\n\n\n### Energy released[edit]\n\n\nThe energy released on the Earth's surface (*M*E, which is the *seismic potential for damage*) by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was estimated at 1.1×1017 joules (110 PJ; 26 Mt).[36] This energy is equivalent to over 1,500 times that of the Hiroshima atomic bomb, but less than that of Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated.[37]\n\n\nThe earthquake generated a seismic oscillation of the Earth's surface of up to 200–300 mm (8–12 in), equivalent to the effect of the tidal forces caused by the Sun and Moon. The seismic waves of the earthquake were felt across the planet, as far away as the U.S. state of Oklahoma, where vertical movements of 3 mm (0.12 in) were recorded. By February 2005, the earthquake's effects were still detectable as a 20 μm (0.02 mm; 0.0008 in) complex harmonic oscillation of the Earth's surface, which gradually diminished and merged with the incessant free oscillation of the Earth more than four months after the earthquake.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vertical-component ground motions recorded by the Global Seismographic Network and displayed by the IRIS Consortium\nBecause of its enormous energy release and shallow rupture depth, the earthquake generated remarkable seismic ground motions around the globe, particularly due to huge Rayleigh (surface) elastic waves that exceeded 10 mm (0.4 in) in vertical amplitude everywhere on Earth. The record section plot displays vertical displacements of the Earth's surface recorded by seismometers from the IRIS/USGS Global Seismographic Network plotted with respect to time (since the earthquake initiation) on the horizontal axis, and vertical displacements of the Earth on the vertical axis (note the 1 cm scale bar at the bottom for scale). The seismograms are arranged vertically by distance from the epicentre in degrees. The earliest, lower amplitude signal is that of the compressional (P) wave, which takes about 22 minutes to reach the other side of the planet (the antipode; in this case near Ecuador). The largest amplitude signals are seismic surface waves that reach the antipode after about 100 minutes. The surface waves can be clearly seen to reinforce near the antipode (with the closest seismic stations in Ecuador), and to subsequently encircle the planet to return to the epicentral region after about 200 minutes. A major aftershock (magnitude 7.1) can be seen at the closest stations starting just after the 200-minute mark. The aftershock would be considered a major earthquake under ordinary circumstances but is dwarfed by the mainshock.\n\n\nThe shift of mass and the massive release of energy slightly altered the Earth's rotation. Weeks after the earthquake, theoretical models suggested the earthquake shortened the length of a day by 2.68 microseconds, due to a decrease in the oblateness of the Earth. [39] It also caused the Earth to minutely \"wobble\" on its axis by up to 25 mm (1 in) in the direction of 145° east longitude,[40] or perhaps by up to 50 or 60 mm (2.0 or 2.4 in).[41] Because of tidal effects of the Moon, the length of a day increases at an average of 15 microseconds per year, so any rotational change due to the earthquake will be lost quickly. Similarly, the natural Chandler wobble of the Earth, which in some cases can be up to 15 m (50 ft), eventually offset the minor wobble produced by the earthquake.\n\n\nThere was 10 m (33 ft) movement laterally and 4–5 m (13–16 ft) vertically along the fault line. Early speculation was that some of the smaller islands south-west of Sumatra, which is on the Burma Plate (the southern regions are on the Sunda Plate), might have moved south-west by up to 36 m (120 ft), but more accurate data released more than a month after the earthquake found the movement to be about 0.2 m (8 in).[42] Since movement was vertical as well as lateral, some coastal areas may have been moved to below sea level. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands appear to have shifted south-west by around 1.25 m (4 ft 1 in) and to have sunk by 1 m (3 ft 3 in).[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Seismic moment release of the largest earthquakes from 1906 to 2005\nIn February 2005, the Royal Navy vessel HMS *Scott* surveyed the seabed around the earthquake zone, which varies in depth between 1,000 and 5,000 m (550 and 2,730 fathoms; 3,300 and 16,400 ft). The survey, conducted using a high-resolution, multi-beam sonar system, revealed that the earthquake had made a considerable impact on the topography of the seabed. 1,500-metre-high (5,000 ft) thrust ridges created by previous geologic activity along the fault had collapsed, generating landslides several kilometres wide. One such landslide consisted of a single block of rock some 100 m (330 ft) high and 2 km (1.2 mi) long. The momentum of the water displaced by tectonic uplift had also dragged massive slabs of rock, each weighing millions of tonnes, as far as 10 km (6 mi) across the seabed. An oceanic trench several kilometres wide was exposed in the earthquake zone.[44]\n\n\nThe TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 satellites happened to pass over the tsunami as it was crossing the ocean.[45] These satellites carry radars that measure precisely the height of the water surface; anomalies in the order of 500 mm (20 in) were measured. Measurements from these satellites may prove invaluable for the understanding of the earthquake and tsunami.[46] Unlike data from tide gauges installed on shores, measurements obtained in the middle of the ocean can be used for computing the parameters of the source earthquake without having to compensate for the complex ways in which proximity to the coast changes the size and shape of a wave.\n\n\n\n## Tsunami[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The tsunami's propagation took 5 hours to reach Western Australia, 7 hours to reach the Arabian Peninsula, and did not reach the South African coast until nearly 11 hours after the earthquake\nThe sudden vertical rise of the seabed by several metres during the earthquake displaced massive volumes of water, resulting in a tsunami that struck the coasts of the Indian Ocean. A tsunami that causes damage far away from its source is sometimes called a teletsunami and is much more likely to be produced by the vertical motion of the seabed than by horizontal motion.[47]\n\n\nThe tsunami, like all others, behaved differently in deep water than in shallow water. In deep ocean water, tsunami waves form only a low, broad hump, barely noticeable and harmless, which generally travels at high speed of 500 to 1,000 km/h (310 to 620 mph); in shallow water near coastlines, a tsunami slows down to only tens of kilometres per hour but, in doing so, forms large destructive waves. Scientists investigating the damage in Aceh found evidence that the wave reached a height of 24 m (80 ft) when coming ashore along large stretches of the coastline, rising to 30 m (100 ft) in some areas when travelling inland.[4] Radar satellites recorded the heights of tsunami waves in deep water: maximum height was at 600 mm (2 ft) two hours after the earthquake, the first such observations ever made.[48][49]\n\n\nAccording to Tad Murty, vice-president of the Tsunami Society, the total energy of the tsunami waves was equivalent to about 5 megatons of TNT (21 PJ), which is more than twice the total explosive energy used during all of World War II (including the two atomic bombs) but still a couple of orders of magnitude less than the energy released in the earthquake itself. In many places, the waves reached as far as 2 km (1.2 mi) inland.[50]\n\n\nBecause the 1,600 km (1,000 mi) fault affected by the earthquake was in a nearly north–south orientation, the greatest strength of the tsunami waves was in an east–west direction. Bangladesh, which lies at the northern end of the Bay of Bengal, had few casualties despite being a low-lying country relatively near the epicentre. It also benefited from the fact that the earthquake proceeded more slowly in the northern rupture zone, greatly reducing the energy of the water displacements in that region.\n\n\n\n![](image)Average height of the waves\nCoasts that have a landmass between them and the tsunami's location of origin are usually safe; however, tsunami waves can sometimes diffract around such landmasses. Thus, the state of Kerala was hit by the tsunami despite being on the western coast of India, and the western coast of Sri Lanka suffered substantial impacts. Distance alone was no guarantee of safety, as Somalia was hit harder than Bangladesh despite being much farther away.\n\n\nBecause of the distances involved, the tsunami took anywhere from fifteen minutes to seven hours to reach the coastlines.[51][52] The northern regions of the Indonesian island of Sumatra were hit quickly, while Sri Lanka and the east coast of India were hit roughly 90 minutes to two hours later. Thailand was struck about two hours later despite being closer to the epicentre because the tsunami travelled more slowly in the shallow Andaman Sea off its western coast.\n\n\nThe tsunami was noticed as far as Struisbaai in South Africa, about 8,500 km (5,300 mi) away, where a 1.5-metre-high (5 ft) tide surged on shore about 16 hours after the earthquake. It took a relatively long time to reach Struisbaai at the southernmost point of Africa, probably because of the broad continental shelf off South Africa and because the tsunami would have followed the South African coast from east to west. The tsunami also reached Antarctica, where tidal gauges at Japan's Showa Base recorded oscillations of up to a metre (3 ft 3 in), with disturbances lasting a couple of days.[53]\n\n\nSome of the tsunami's energy escaped into the Pacific Ocean, where it produced small but measurable tsunamis along the western coasts of North and South America, typically around 200 to 400 mm (7.9 to 15.7 in).[54] At Manzanillo, Mexico, a 2.6 m (8.5 ft) crest-to-trough tsunami was measured. As well, the tsunami was large enough to be detected in Vancouver, which puzzled many scientists, as the tsunamis measured in some parts of South America were larger than those measured in some parts of the Indian Ocean. It has been theorized that the tsunamis were focused and directed at long ranges by the mid-ocean ridges which run along the margins of the continental plates.[55]\n\n\n\n### Early signs and warnings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Maximum recession of tsunami waters at Kata Noi Beach at 10:25 a.m., prior to the third—and strongest—tsunami wave\nDespite a delay of up to several hours between the earthquake and the impact of the tsunami, nearly all of the victims were taken by surprise. There were no tsunami warning systems in the Indian Ocean to detect tsunamis or to warn the general population living around the ocean.[56] Tsunami detection is not easy because while a tsunami is in deep water, it has little height and a network of sensors is needed to detect it.\n\n\nTsunamis are more frequent in the Pacific Ocean than in other oceans because of earthquakes in the \"Ring of Fire\". Although the extreme western edge of the Ring of Fire extends into the Indian Ocean (the point where the earthquake struck), no warning system exists in that ocean. Tsunamis there are relatively rare despite earthquakes being relatively frequent in Indonesia. The last major tsunami was caused by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. Not every earthquake produces large tsunamis: on 28 March 2005, a magnitude 8.7 earthquake hit roughly the same area of the Indian Ocean but did not result in a major tsunami.\n\n\nThe first warning sign of a possible tsunami is the earthquake itself. However, tsunamis can strike thousands of kilometres away where the earthquake is felt only weakly or not at all. Also, in the minutes preceding a tsunami strike, the sea sometimes recedes temporarily from the coast, which was observed on the eastern earthquake rupture zone such as the coastlines of Aceh, Phuket island, and Khao Lak area in Thailand, Penang island of Malaysia, and the Andaman and Nicobar islands. This rare sight reportedly induced people, especially children, to visit the coast to investigate and collect stranded fish on as much as 2.5 km (1.6 mi) of exposed beach, with fatal results.[57] However, not all tsunamis cause this \"disappearing sea\" effect. In some cases, there are no warning signs at all: the sea will suddenly swell without retreating, surprising many people and giving them little time to flee.\n\n\n\nTsunami wave field in the Bay of Bengal an hour after the earthquake\nOne of the few coastal areas to evacuate ahead of the tsunami was on the Indonesian island of Simeulue, close to the epicentre. Island folklore recounted an earthquake and tsunami in 1907, and the islanders fled to inland hills after the initial shaking and before the tsunami struck. These tales and oral folklore from previous generations may have helped the survival of the inhabitants.[58] On Maikhao Beach in north Phuket City, Thailand, a 10-year-old British tourist named Tilly Smith had studied tsunamis in geography at school and recognised the warning signs of the receding ocean and frothing bubbles. She and her parents warned others on the beach, which was evacuated safely.[59] John Chroston, a biology teacher from Scotland, also recognised the signs at Kamala Bay north of Phuket, taking a busload of vacationers and locals to safety on higher ground.\n\n\nAnthropologists had initially expected the aboriginal population of the Andaman Islands to be badly affected by the tsunami and even feared the already depopulated Onge tribe could have been wiped out.[60] Many of the aboriginal tribes evacuated and suffered fewer casualties, however.[61][62] Oral traditions developed from previous earthquakes helped the aboriginal tribes escape the tsunami. For example, the folklore of the Onges talks of \"huge shaking of ground followed by high wall of water\". Almost all of the Onge people seemed to have survived the tsunami.[63]\n\n\n\n### Indonesia[edit]\n\n\n#### Aceh[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsunami inundation height can be seen on a house in Banda Aceh\nThe tsunami devastated the coastline of Aceh province, about 20 minutes after the earthquake. Banda Aceh, the closest major city, suffered severe casualties. The sea receded and exposed the seabed, prompting locals to collect stranded fish and explore the area. Local eyewitnesses described three large waves, with the first wave rising gently to the foundation of the buildings, followed minutes later by a sudden withdrawal of the sea near the port of Ulèë Lheue. This was succeeded by the appearance of two large black-coloured steep waves which then travelled inland into the capital city as a large turbulent bore. Eyewitnesses described the tsunami as a \"black giant\", \"mountain\" and a \"wall of water\". Video footage revealed torrents of black water, surging by windows of a two-story residential area situated about 3.2 km (2.0 mi) inland. Additionally, amateur footage recorded in the middle of the city captured an approaching black surge flowing down the city streets, full of debris, inundating them.[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Apung 1*, a 2,600-ton vessel, was flung some 2 km (1.2 mi) to 3 km (1.9 mi) inland. In the years following the disaster, it became a local tourist attraction and has remained where it came to rest.\nThe level of destruction was extreme on the northwestern areas of the city, immediately inland of the aquaculture ponds, and directly facing the Indian Ocean. The tsunami height was reduced from 12 m (39 ft) at Ulee Lheue to 6 m (20 ft) a further 8 km (5.0 mi) to the north-east. The inundation was observed to extend 3–4 km (1.9–2.5 mi) inland throughout the city. Within 2–3 km (1.2–1.9 mi) of the shoreline, houses, except for strongly-built reinforced concrete ones with brick walls, which seemed to have been partially damaged by the earthquake before the tsunami attack, were swept away or destroyed by the tsunami.[65][66]\nThe area toward the sea was wiped clean of nearly every structure, while closer to the river, dense construction in a commercial district showed the effects of severe flooding. The flow depth at the city was just at the level of the second floor, and there were large amounts of debris piled along the streets and in the ground-floor storefronts. In the seaside section of Ulee Lheue, the flow depths were over 9 m (30 ft). Footage showed evidence of back-flowing of the Aceh River, carrying debris and people from destroyed villages at the coast and transporting them up to 40 km (25 mi) inland.[67]\n\n\nA group of small islands: Weh, Breueh, Nasi, Teunom, Bunta, Lumpat, and Batee lie just north of the capital city. The tsunami reached a run-up of 10–20 m (33–66 ft) on the western shorelines of Breueh Island and Nasi Island. Coastal villages were destroyed by the waves. On the island of Pulau Weh, strong surges were experienced in the port of Sabang, yet there was little damage with reported runup values of 3–5 m (9.8–16.4 ft), most likely due to the island being sheltered from the direct attack by the islands to the south-west.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)Overturned cement carrier in Lhoknga\nLhoknga is a small coastal community about 13 km (8.1 mi) south-west of Banda Aceh, located on a flat coastal plain in between two rainforest-covered hills, overlooking a large bay and famous for its large swathe of white sandy beach and surfing activities. The locals reported 10 to 12 waves, with the second and third being the highest and most destructive. Interviews with the locals revealed that the sea temporarily receded and exposed coral reefs. In the distant horizon, gigantic black waves about 30 m (98 ft) high made explosion-like sounds as it broke and approached the shore. The first wave came rapidly landward from the south-west as a turbulent bore about 0.5–2.5 m (1.6–8.2 ft) high. The second and third waves were 15–30 m (49–98 ft) high at the coast and appeared like gigantic surfing waves but \"taller than the coconut trees and was like a mountain\".[68] The second wave was the largest; it came from the west-southwest within five minutes of the first wave. The tsunami stranded cargo ships, barges and destroyed a cement mining facility near the Lampuuk coast, where it reached the fourth level of the building.[5][69][70]\n\n\n\n![](image)Baiturrahim Mosque survived the tsunami in Ulee Lheue, Banda Aceh\nMeulaboh, a remote coastal city, was among the hardest hit by the tsunami. The waves arrived after the sea receded about 500 m (1,600 ft), followed by an advancing small tsunami. The second and third destructive waves arrived later, which exceeded the height of the coconut trees. The inundation distance is about 5 km (3.1 mi). Other towns on Aceh's west coast hit by the disaster included Leupung, Lhokruet, Lamno, Patek, Calang, and Teunom. Affected or destroyed towns on the region's north and east coast were Pidie Regency, Samalanga, Panteraja, and Lhokseumawe. The high fatality rate in the area was mainly due to lack of preparation of the community towards a tsunami and limited knowledge and education among the population regarding the natural phenomenon. Helicopter surveys showed entire settlements virtually destroyed with destruction within miles inland, and only some mosques left standing.[71]\n\n\nThe greatest run-up height of the tsunami was measured at a hill between Lhoknga and Leupung, on the western coast of the northern tip of Sumatra, near Banda Aceh, and reached 51 m (167 ft).[5][72]\n\n\nThe tsunami heights in Sumatra:[65]\n\n\n\n* 15–30 m (49–98 ft) on the west coast of Aceh\n* 6–12 m (20–39 ft) on the Banda Aceh coast\n* 6 m (20 ft) on the Krueng Raya coast\n* 5 m (16 ft) on the Sigli coast\n* 3–6 m (9.8–19.7 ft) on the north coast of Weh Island directly facing the tsunami source\n* 3 m (9.8 ft) on the opposite side of the coast of Weh Island facing the tsunami\n\n\n### Sri Lanka[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fishing boat stranded in Batticaloa\nThe island country of Sri Lanka, located about 1,700 km (1,100 mi) from Sumatra, was ravaged by the tsunami around 2 hours after the earthquake. The tsunami first struck the eastern coastline and subsequently refracted around the southern point of Sri Lanka (Dondra Head). The refracted tsunami waves then inundated the southwestern part of Sri Lanka after some of its energy was reflected from impact with the Maldives.[73] In Sri Lanka, the civilian casualties were second only to those in Indonesia, with approximately 35,000 killed. The eastern shores of Sri Lanka were the hardest hit since it faced the epicentre of the earthquake, while the southwestern shores were hit later, but the death toll was just as severe. The southwestern shores are a hotspot for tourists and fishing.[74] The degradation of the natural environment in Sri Lanka contributed to the high death tolls. Approximately 90,000 buildings and many wooden houses were destroyed.[74]\n\n\nThe tsunami arrived on the island as a small brown-orange-coloured flood. Moments later, the ocean floor was exposed as much as 1 km (0.62 mi) in places, which was followed by massive second and third waves. Amateur video recorded at the city of Galle showed a large deluge flooding the city, carrying debris and sweeping away people while in the coastal resort town of Beruwala, the tsunami appeared as a huge brown-orange-coloured bore which reached the first level of a hotel, causing destruction and taking people unaware. Other videos recorded showed that the tsunami appeared like a flood raging inland. The construction of seawalls and breakwaters reduced the power of waves at some locations.\n\n\nThe largest run-up measured was at 12.5 m (41 ft) with inundation distance of 390–1,500 m (1,280–4,920 ft) in Yala.[75] In Hambantota, run-ups measured 11 m (36 ft) with the greatest inundation distance of 2 km (1.2 mi). Run-up measurements along the Sri Lankan coasts are at 2.4–4.11 m (7 ft 10 in – 13 ft 6 in).[75][73] Waves measured on the east coast ranged from 4.5–9 m (15–30 ft) at Pottuvill to Batticaloa at 2.6–5 m (8 ft 6 in – 16 ft 5 in) in the north-east around Trincomalee and 4–5 m (13–16 ft) in the west coast from Moratuwa to Ambalangoda.\n\n\nSri Lanka tsunami height survey:\n\n\n\n* 9 m (30 ft) at Koggala\n* 6 m (20 ft) at Galle port\n* 4.8 m (16 ft) around the Galle coast\n* 8.7 m (29 ft) at Nonagama\n* 4.9 m (16 ft) at Weligama\n* 4 m (13 ft) at Dodundawa\n* 4.7 m (15 ft) at Ambalangoda\n* 4.7 m (15 ft) at Hikkaduwa Fishery Harbour\n* 10 m (33 ft) at Kahawa\n* 4.8 m (16 ft) at North Beach of Beruwala\n* 6 m (20 ft) at Paiyagala\n\n\nA regular passenger train operating between Maradana and Matara was derailed and overturned by the tsunami and claimed at least 1,700 lives, the largest single rail disaster death toll in history.[76] Estimates based on the state of the shoreline and a high-water mark on a nearby building place the tsunami 7.5–9 m (25–30 ft) above sea level and 2–3 m (6 ft 7 in – 9 ft 10 in) higher than the top of the train.\n\n\n\n### Thailand[edit]\n\n\nThe tsunami travelled eastward through the Andaman Sea and hit the south-western coasts of Thailand, about 2 hours after the earthquake. Located about 500 km (310 mi) from the epicentre, at the time, the region was popular with tourists because of Christmas. Many of these tourists were caught off-guard by the tsunami, as they had no prior warning. The tsunami hit during high tide. Major locations damaged included the western shores of Phuket island, the resort town of Khao Lak in Phang Nga Province, the coastal provinces of Krabi, Satun, Ranong and Trang and small offshore islands like Ko Racha Yai, the Phi Phi islands, the Surin Islands and the Similan archipelago. Approximately 8,000 people were killed.\n\n\nThailand experienced the second largest tsunami run-up. The tsunami heights recorded:[77][78]\n\n\n\n![](image)Thai Navy boat stranded almost 2 km (1.2 mi) inland\n* 6–10 m (20–33 ft) in Khao Lak\n* 3–6 m (9.8–19.7 ft) along the west coast of Phuket island\n* 3 m (9.8 ft) along the south coast of Phuket island\n* 2 m (6 ft 7 in) along the east coast of Phuket island\n* 4–6 m (13–20 ft) on the Phi Phi Islands\n* 19.6 m (64 ft) at Ban Thung Dap\n* 5 m (16 ft) at Ramson\n* 6.8 m (22 ft) at Ban Thale Nok\n* 5 m (16 ft) at Hat Praphat (Ranong Coastal Resources Research Station)\n* 6.3 m (21 ft) at Thai Mueang District\n* 6.8 m (22 ft) at Rai Dan\n\n\nThe province of Phang Nga was the most affected area in Thailand. The quiet resort town of Khao Lak is located on a stretch of golden sandy beach, famed for its hotels overlooking the Andaman Sea and hilly rainforests. A video, taken by a local restaurant manager from a hill adjacent to the beach, showed that the tsunami's arrival was preceded by a sudden retreat of the sea exposing the seafloor. Many tourists and locals can be seen trying to gather fish. Moments later, the tsunami arrives as a wall of foaming water that slams into the coast, washing away numerous people who had no time to escape. Another amateur video, captured by a German family at beach level, showed the tsunami appearing as a white horizontal line in the distant horizon, gradually becoming bigger (bore-like), engulfing a jet skier and lifting two police boats.[79] A maximum inundation of approximately 2 km (1.2 mi) was measured, the inundated depths were 4–7 m (13–23 ft) and there was evidence that the tsunami reached the third floor of a resort hotel. The tsunami in Khao Lak was bigger due to offshore coral reefs and shallow seafloor which caused the tsunami to pile-up. This was similar to eyewitness accounts of the tsunami at Banda Aceh.\n\n\nKhao Lak also experienced the largest tsunami run-up height outside of Sumatra.[77][*page needed*]. The highest-recorded tsunami run-up was measured 19.6 m (64 ft) at Ban Thung Dap, on the south-west tip of Ko Phra Thong Island and the second-highest at 15.8 m (52 ft) at Ban Nam Kim.[78] Moreover, the largest death toll occurred at Khao Lak, with about 5,000 people killed.\n\n\nIn addition, the tsunami inflicted damage to the popular resort town of Ao Nang in Krabi Province. Video footage showed that the tsunami appeared as multiple white surfs violently lifting up yachts, boats and crashing onto beaches. Footage captured at Koh Lanta showed a wall of water swamping the beach, while another video taken at another location showed a large surfing wave like tsunami approaching the shore, lifting up a yacht and flooding the beach. At Koh Sriboya, the tsunami advanced inland as a turbulent medium bore, while at Koh Phayam, Ranong Province, the tsunami appeared as a wall of water.\n\n\nAt Phuket Province, the island province's western beaches were struck by the tsunami. At Patong Beach, a popular tourist destination, the tsunami first arrived as a small flood, which swept away cars and surprised people. About 10 minutes later, the sea receded for a while before the tsunami arrived again as a large wall of water looming over the skyline and flooding the coast. Another video from Kamala Beach showed the tsunami flooding the ground floor of a restaurant sweeping away an elderly couple. On Karon Beach, Kamala Beach and Kata Beach, the tsunami came in like a surging flood inland carrying people and cars. On some locations, a coastal road was built which was higher than the shore, protecting a hotel which was behind it. On the east coast of Phuket Island, the tsunami height was about 2 m. In one river mouth, many boats were damaged. The tsunami moved counter-clockwise around Phuket Island, as was the case at Okushiri Island in the 1993 Hokkaido earthquake. According to interviews, the second wave was the largest.[77] The tsunami heights were 5–6 m (16–20 ft) and the inundated depth was about 2 m (6.6 ft). The tsunami surprised many tourists at Koh Racha Yai, where it flooded the resorts. About 250 people perished directly in the tsunami.\n\n\nThe Phi Phi Islands are a group of small islands that were affected by the tsunami. The north bay of Phi Phi Don Island opens to the north-west in the direction of the tsunami. The measured tsunami height on this beach was 5.8 m (19 ft). According to eyewitness accounts, the tsunami came from the north and south. The ground level was about 2 m above sea level, where there were many cottages and hotels. The south bay opens to the south-east and faces in the opposite direction from the tsunami. Furthermore, Phi Phi Le Island shields the port of Phi Phi Don Island. The measured tsunami height was 4.6 m (15 ft) in the port.[77] Amateur camcorder footage taken by Israeli tourists showed the tsunami advancing inland suddenly as a small flood, gradually becoming more powerful and engulfing the whole beach and resort, with the tsunami carrying a yacht out to sea.\n\n\nMoreover, the tsunami was detected by scuba divers around offshore islands like the Similan Islands and the Surin Islands. The divers reported being caught in a violent, swirling current suddenly while underwater. Local camcorder footage showed the tsunami surging inland and flooding camping equipment at the Similan Islands while the tsunami caught tourists unaware at the Surin Islands, and dragging them out towards the sea.\n\n\n\n### India[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tree stumps and debris remain on Karaikal beach several years after the 2004 tsunami\nThe tsunami reached the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu along the southeastern coastline of the Indian mainland about 2 hours after the earthquake. At the same time, it arrived in the state of Kerala, on the southwestern coast. There were two to five tsunamis that coincided with the local high tide in some areas.[80][81][82][83]\n\n\nThe tsunami runup height measured in mainland India by Ministry of Home Affairs includes:[83]\n\n\n\n* 3.4 m (11 ft) at Kerala, inundation distance of 0.5–1.5 km (0.31–0.93 mi) with 250 km (160 mi) of coastline affected\n* 4.5 m (15 ft) at the southern coastline of Tamil Nadu, inundation distance of 0.2–2 km (0.12–1.24 mi) with 100 km (62 mi) of coastline affected\n* 5 m (16 ft) at the eastern coastline of Tamil Nadu facing tsunami source, inundation distance of 0.4–1.5 km (0.25–0.93 mi) with 800 km (500 mi) of coastline affected\n* 4 m (13 ft) at Pondicherry, inundation distance of 0.2–2 km (0.12–1.24 mi) with 25 km (16 mi) of coastline affected\n* 2.2 m (7.2 ft) at Andhra Pradesh, inundation distance of 0.2–1 km (0.12–0.62 mi) with 985 km (612 mi) of coastline affected\n\n\nAlong the coast of Tamil Nadu, the 13 km (8.1 mi) Marina Beach in Chennai was battered by the tsunami which swept across the beach taking morning walkers unaware. Amateur video recorded taken at a resort beach showed the tsunami arriving as a large wall of water as it approached the coast and flooding it as it advanced inland. Besides that, a 10 m (33 ft) black muddy tsunami ravaged the city of Karaikal, where 492 people died. The city of Pondicherry, protected by seawalls was relatively unscathed. Local video recorded that before the arrival of the tsunami, people can be seen swarming the beach to check on stranded fish from the exposed beach. Furthermore, at the coastal town of Kanyakumari, the seabed was exposed briefly before a large wall of water can be seen on the horizon and subsequently flooding the town. Other footage showed the tsunami dramatically crashed into the Vivekananda Rock Memorial.[83] The worst affected area in Tamil Nadu was Nagapattinam district, with 6,051 fatalities caused by a 5 m (16 ft) tsunami, followed by Cuddalore district, with many villages destroyed.[83] Most of the people killed were members of the fishing community.[83] Velankanni a sea shore town with a Catholic Basilica and a popular pilgrimage destination was also one of the worst hit by this tsunami that struck at around 9.30 am on that Sunday, when pilgrims who were mostly from Kerala among others were inside the church attending the Malayalam Mass. The rising sea water did not enter the shrine, but the receding waters swept away hundreds of pilgrims who were on the beach.[84] The shrine's compound, nearby villages, hundreds of shops, homes and pilgrims were washed away into the sea. About 600 pilgrims died.[85] Rescue teams extricated more than 400 bodies from the sand and rocks in the vicinity and large number of unidentified bodies were buried in mass graves.\n\n\nThe state of Kerala experienced tsunami-related damage in three southern densely populated districts, Ernakulam, Alappuzha, and Kollam, due to diffraction of the waves around Sri Lanka. The southernmost district of Thiruvananthapuram, however, escaped damage, possibly due to the wide turn of the diffracted waves at the peninsular tip. Major damage occurred in two narrow strips of land bound on the west by the Arabian Sea and on the east by the Kerala backwaters. The waves receded before the first tsunami with the highest fatality reported from the densely populated Alappad panchayat (including the villages of Cheriya Azhikkal and Azhikkal) at Kollam district, caused by a 4 m (13 ft) tsunami.[83] A video recorded by locals showed the tsunami flooding the beach and villages, causing despair amongst the villagers.\n\n\n\n![](image)A car deposited on top of a fence and various pieces of debris in Chennai\nMany villages in the state of Andhra Pradesh were destroyed. In the Krishna district, the tsunami created havoc in Manginapudi and on Machalipattanam Beach. The most affected was Prakasham District, recording 35 deaths, with maximum damage at Singraikonda.[83] Given the enormous power of the tsunami, the fishing industry suffered the greatest. Moreover, the cost of damage in the transport sector was reported in the tens of thousands.[83]\n\n\nThe tsunami run-up was only 1.6 m (5.2 ft) in areas in the state of Tamil Nadu shielded by the island of Sri Lanka but was 4–5 m (13–16 ft) in coastal districts such as Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu directly across from Sumatra. On the western coast, the runup elevations were 4.5 m (15 ft) at Kanyakumari District in Tamil Nadu and 3.4 m (11 ft) each at Kollam and Ernakulam districts in Kerala. The time between the waves ranged from about 15 minutes to 90 minutes.[80][82][86] The tsunami varied in height from 2 m (6.6 ft) to 10 m (33 ft) based on survivors' accounts.[83] The tsunami travelled 2.5 km (1.6 mi) at its maximum inland at Karaikal, Puducherry.[83] The inundation distance varied between 1,006–500 m (3,301–1,640 ft) in most areas, except at river mouths, where it was more than 1 km (0.62 mi). Areas with dense coconut groves or mangroves had much smaller inundation distances, and those with river mouths or backwaters saw larger inundation distances.[*citation needed*] Presence of seawalls at the Kerala and Tamil Nadu coasts reduced the impact of the waves. However, when the seawalls were made of loose stones, the stones were displaced and carried a few metres inland.[80][82][86]\n\n\n\n#### Andaman and Nicobar Islands[edit]\n\n\nDue to close proximity to the earthquake, the tsunami took just minutes to devastate the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Andaman Islands were moderately affected while the island of Little Andaman and the Nicobar Islands were severely affected by the tsunami.\n\n\nIn South Andaman island, based on local eyewitnesses, there were three tsunami waves, with the third being the most destructive. Flooding occurred at the coast and low-lying areas inland, which were connected to open sea through creeks. Inundation was observed, along the east coast of South Andaman Island, restricted to Chidiyatapu, Burmanallah, Kodiaghat, Beadnabad, Corbyn's cove and Marina Park/Aberdeen Jetty areas. Along the west coast, the inundation was observed around Guptapara, Manjeri, Wandoor, Collinpur and Tirur regions. Several near-shore establishments and numerous infrastructures such as seawalls and a 20 MW diesel-generated power plant at Bamboo Flat were destroyed.[87] At Port Blair, the water receded before the first wave, and the third wave was the tallest and caused the most damage.\n\n\nResults of the tsunami survey in South Andaman along Chiriyatapu, Corbyn's Cove and Wandoor beaches:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* 5 m (16 ft) in maximum tsunami height with a run-up of 4.24 m (13.9 ft) at Chiriyatapu Beach\n* 5.5 m (18 ft) in maximum tsunami height and run-up at Corbyn's Cove Beach\n* 6.6 m (22 ft) in maximum tsunami height and run-up of 4.63 m (15.2 ft) at Wandoor Beach\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the Little Andaman, tsunami waves impinged on the eastern shore about 25 to 30 minutes after the earthquake in a four-wave cycle of which the fourth tsunami was the most devastating with a wave height of about 10 m (33 ft). The tsunami destroyed settlements at Hut Bay within a range of 1 km (0.62 mi) from the seashore. Run up level up to 3.8 m (12 ft) have been measured.[87]\n\n\nIn Malacca, located on the island of Car Nicobar, there were three tsunami waves. The sea was observed to rise suddenly before the onset of the first wave. The first wave came 5 minutes after the earthquake, preceded by a recession of the sea up to 600–700 m (2,000–2,300 ft).[*citation needed*]. The second and third waves came in 10 minutes intervals after the first wave. The third wave was the strongest, with a maximum tsunami wave height of 11 m (36 ft). Waves nearly three stories high devastated the Indian Air Force base, located just south of Malacca. The maximum tsunami wave height of 11 m (36 ft).[*citation needed*] Inundation limit was found to be up to 1.25 km (0.78 mi) inland. The impact of the waves was so severe that four oil tankers were thrown almost 800 m (2,600 ft) from the seashore near Malacca to the Air force colony main gate.[87] In Chuckchucha and Lapati, the tsunami arrived in a three-wave cycle with a maximum tsunami wave height of 12 m (39 ft).\n\n\nIn Campbell Bay of Great Nicobar Island, the tsunami waves hit the area three times with an inundation limit of 250–500 m (820–1,640 ft). A rise in sea level was observed before the first wave came within 5 minutes of the earthquake. The second and third waves came in 10-minute intervals after the first. The second wave was the strongest. The tsunami waves wreaked havoc in the densely populated Jogindar Nagar area, situated 13 km (8.1 mi) south of Campbell Bay.[*citation needed*] According to local accounts,[*attribution needed*] tsunami waves attacked the area three times. The first wave came five minutes after the mainshock (0629 hrs.) with a marginal drop in sea level. The second wave came 10 minutes after the first one with a maximum height of 4.8 m (16 ft) to 8 m (26 ft) and caused the major destruction. The third wave came within 15 minutes after the second with lower wave height. The maximum inundation limit due to tsunami water was about 500 m (1,600 ft).[87]\n\n\nThe worst affected island in the Andaman & Nicobar chain is Katchall Island, with 303 people confirmed dead and 4,354 missing out of a total population of 5,312.[88][89][90] The significant shielding of Port Blair and Campbell Bay by steep mountainous outcrops contributed to the relatively low wave heights at these locations, whereas the open terrain along the eastern coast at Malacca and Hut Bay contributed to the great height of the tsunami waves.[89][91]\n\n\nReports of tsunami wave height:[92][93]\n\n\n\n* 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) at Diglipur and Rangat at North Andaman Island\n* 8 m (26 ft) high at Campbell Bay on Great Nicobar Island\n* 10–12 m (33–39 ft) high at Malacca (in Car Nicobar Island) and at Hut Bay on Little Andaman Island\n* 3 m (9.8 ft) high at Port Blair on South Andaman Island\n\n\n### Maldives[edit]\n\n\nThe tsunami severely affected the Maldives at a distance of 2,500 km (1,600 mi) from the epicentre. Similar to Sri Lanka, survivors reported three waves with the second wave being the most powerful. Being rich in coral reefs, the Maldives provides an opportunity for scientists to assess the impact of a tsunami on coral atolls. The significantly lower tsunami impact on the Maldives compared to Sri Lanka is mostly due to the topography and bathymetry of the atoll chain with offshore coral reefs, deep channels separating individual atolls and its arrival within low tide which decreased the power of the tsunami. After the tsunami, there was some concern that the country might be submerged entirely and become uninhabitable. However, this was proven untrue.\nThe highest tsunami wave measured was 4 m (13 ft) at Vilufushi Island. The tsunami arrived approximately 2 hours after the earthquake. The greatest tsunami inundation occurred at North Male Atoll, Male island at 250 m (820 ft) along the streets.\n\n\nLocal footage recorded showed the tsunami flooding the streets up to knee level in town, while another video taken at the beach showed the tsunami slowly flooding and gradually surging inland.\n\n\nThe Maldives tsunami wave analysis:\n\n\n\n* 1.3–2.4 m (4 ft 3 in – 7 ft 10 in) at North Male Atoll, Male Island\n* 2 m (6 ft 7 in) at North Male Atoll, Huhule Island\n* 1.7–2.8 m (5 ft 7 in – 9 ft 2 in) at South Male Atoll, Embudhu Finothu\n* 2.5–3.3 m (8 ft 2 in – 10 ft 10 in) at Laamu Atoll, Fonadhoo Island\n* 2.2–2.9 m (7 ft 3 in – 9 ft 6 in) at Laamu Atoll, Gan Island\n* 2.3–3 m (7 ft 7 in – 9 ft 10 in) at North Male Atoll, Dhiffushi Island\n* 2.2–2.4 m (7 ft 3 in – 7 ft 10 in) at North Male Atoll, Huraa Island\n* more than 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) at North Male Atoll, Kuda Huraa Island\n\n\n### Myanmar[edit]\n\n\nIn Myanmar, the tsunami caused only moderate damage, which arrived between 2 and 5.5 hours after the earthquake. Although the country's western Andaman Sea coastline lies at the proximity of the rupture zone, there were smaller tsunamis than the neighbouring Thai coast, because the main tsunami source did not extend to the Andaman Islands. Another factor is that some coasts of Taninthayi Division were protected by the Myeik Archipelago. Based on scientific surveys from Ayeyarwady Delta through Taninthayi Division, it was revealed that tsunami heights along the Myanmar coast were between 0.4–2.9 m (1 ft 4 in – 9 ft 6 in). Eyewitnesses compared the tsunami with the \"rainy-season high tide\"; although at most locations, the tsunami height was similar or smaller than the \"rainy-season high tide\" level.[94]\n\n\nTsunami survey heights:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* 0.6–2.3 m (2 ft 0 in – 7 ft 7 in) around the Ayeyarwady delta\n* 0.9–2.9 m (2 ft 11 in – 9 ft 6 in) at Dawei area\n* 0.7–2.2 m (2 ft 4 in – 7 ft 3 in) around Myeik\n* 0.4–2.6 m (1 ft 4 in – 8 ft 6 in) around Kawthaung\n\n\nInterviews with local people indicate that they did not feel the earthquake in Taninthayi Division or Ayeyarwady Delta. The 71 casualties can be attributed to poor housing infrastructure and additionally, the fact that the coastal residents in the surveyed areas live on flat land along the coast, especially in the Ayeyarwady Delta, and that there is no higher ground to which to evacuate. The tsunami heights from the 2004 December earthquake were not more than 3 m (9.8 ft) along the Myanmar coast, the amplitudes were slightly large off the Ayeyarwady Delta, probably because the shallow delta caused a concentration in tsunami energy.[94]\n\n\n\n### Somalia[edit]\n\n\nThe tsunami travelled 5,000 km (3,100 mi) west across the open ocean before striking the East African country of Somalia. Around 289 fatalities were reported in the Horn of Africa, drowned by four tsunami waves. The hardest-hit was a 650 km (400 mi) stretch of the Somalia coastline between Garacad (Mudug region) and Xaafuun (Bari region), which forms part of the Puntland province. Most of the victims were reported along the low-lying Xaafuun Peninsula.[95] The Puntland coast in northern Somalia was by far the area hardest hit by the waves to the west of the Indian subcontinent. The waves arrived around noon local time.[95]\n\n\nConsequently, tsunami runup heights vary from 5 m (16 ft) to 9 m (30 ft) with inundation distances varying from 44 m (144 ft) to 704 m (2,310 ft). The maximum runup height of almost 9 m (30 ft) was recorded in Bandarbeyla. An even higher runup point was measured on a cliff near the town of Eyl, solely on an eyewitness account.\n\n\nThe highest death toll was in Hafun, with 19 dead and 160 people presumed missing out of its 5,000 inhabitants. This was the highest number of casualties in a single African town and the largest tsunami death toll in a single town to the west of the Indian subcontinent. In Xaafuun, small drawbacks were observed before the third and most powerful tsunami wave flooded the town.[95]\n\n\n\n### Other locations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Flooding in George Town, Malaysia\nThe tsunami also reached Malaysia, mainly on the northern states such as Kedah, Perak and Penang and on offshore islands such as Langkawi island. Peninsular Malaysia was shielded by the full force of the tsunami due to the protection offered by the island of Sumatra, which lies just off the western coast.[96]\n\n\nBangladesh escaped major damage and deaths because the water displaced by the strike-slip fault was relatively little on the northern section of the rupture zone, which ruptured slowly. In Yemen, the tsunami killed two people with a maximum runup of 2 m (6.6 ft).[97]\n\n\nThe tsunami was detected in the southern parts of east Africa, where rough seas were reported, specifically on the eastern and southern coasts that face the Indian Ocean. A few other African countries also recorded fatalities; one in Kenya, three in Seychelles, ten in Tanzania, and South Africa, where two were killed as a direct result of the tsunami—the furthest from the epicentre.[98][99]\n\n\nTidal surges also occurred along the Western Australian coast that lasted for several hours, resulting in boats losing their moorings and two people needing to be rescued.[100]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n### Countries affected[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Countries affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami\n\n![](image)Countries affected\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, a total of 227,898 people died.[1] Measured in lives lost, this is one of the ten worst earthquakes in recorded history, as well as the single worst tsunami in history. Indonesia was the worst affected area, with most death toll estimates at around 170,000.[101] An initial report by Siti Fadilah Supari, the Indonesian Minister of Health at the time, estimated the death total to be as high as 220,000 in Indonesia alone, giving a total of 280,000 fatalities.[102] However, the estimated number of dead and missing in Indonesia were later reduced by over 50,000. In their report, the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition stated, \"It should be remembered that all such data are subject to error, as data on missing persons especially are not always as good as one might wish\".[6] A much higher number of deaths has been suggested for Myanmar based on reports from Thailand.[103]\n\n\nThe tsunami caused severe damage and deaths as far as the east coast of Africa, with the furthest recorded fatality directly attributed to the tsunami at Rooi-Els, close to Cape Town, 8,000 km (5,000 mi) from the epicentre.[104]\n\n\nRelief agencies reported that one third of the dead appeared to be children. This was a result of the high proportion of children in the populations of many of the affected regions and because children were the least able to resist being overcome by the surging waters. Oxfam went on to report that as many as four times more women than men were killed in some regions because they were waiting on the beach for the fishers to return and looking after their children in the houses.[105]\n\n\nStates of emergency were declared in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Maldives. The United Nations estimated at the outset that the relief operation would be the costliest in human history.[*citation needed*] Then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated that reconstruction would probably take between five and ten years. Governments and non-governmental organizations feared that the final death toll might double as a result of diseases, prompting a massive humanitarian response.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn addition to a large number of local residents, up to 9,000 foreign tourists (mostly Europeans) enjoying the peak holiday travel season were among the dead or missing, especially people from the Nordic countries.[106] Sweden was the European country most severely affected both in absolute numbers, and by a wide margin when considered in relation to the country's population, with a death toll of 543. Germany was close behind with 539 identified victims.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Affected country[a] | Confirmed deaths\n | Estimated deaths[b] | Injured\n | Missing\n | Displaced\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Indonesia | 130,736 | 167,540 |  | 37,063 | 500,000+\n | [107] |\n| ![](image) Sri Lanka | 35,322[c] | 35,322 | 21,411 |  | 516,150 | [108] |\n| ![](image) India | 12,405 | 16,269 |  | 3,874 | 647,599 |  |\n| ![](image) Thailand | 5,395[d] | 8,212 | 8,457 | 2,817 | 7,000 | [109][110] |\n| ![](image) Somalia | 78 | 289 |  |  | 5,000 | [111][112] |\n| ![](image) Myanmar | 61 | 400–600\n | 45 | 200 | 3,200 | [103][113] |\n| ![](image) Maldives | 82 | 108 |  | 26 | 15,000+\n | [114][115] |\n| ![](image) Malaysia | 68 | 75 | 299 | 6 | 5,000+\n | [116][117] |\n| ![](image) Tanzania | 10 | 13 |  | 3 |  | [118] |\n| ![](image) Seychelles | 3 | 3 | 57 |  | 200 | [119][120] |\n| ![](image) Bangladesh | 2 | 2 |  |  |  | [121] |\n| ![](image) South Africa | 2[e] | 2 |  |  |  | [122] |\n| ![](image) Yemen | 2 | 2 |  |  |  | [123] |\n| ![](image) Kenya | 1 | 1 | 2 |  |  |  |\n| ![](image) Madagascar |  |  |  |  | 1,000+\n | [124] |\n| **Total estimates** | **184,167** | **227,898** | **125,000** | **43,789** | **1,740,000** |  |\n| * **^a** This table refers only to countries directly affected by the tsunami, not to countries whose citizens were affected while overseas.\n* **^b** Includes those reported under 'Confirmed'.

Severe damage was inflicted on ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, forests, coastal wetlands, vegetation, sand dunes and rock formations, animal and plant biodiversity and groundwater. Also, the spread of solid and liquid waste and industrial chemicals, water pollution and the destruction of sewage collectors and treatment plants threatened the environment even further, in untold ways. The environmental impact took a long time and significant resources to assess.[125]\n\n\nThe main effect was caused by poisoning of the freshwater supplies and of the soil by saltwater infiltration and a deposit of a salt layer over arable land. In the Maldives, 16 to 17 coral reef atolls that were overcome by sea waves are without fresh water and could be rendered uninhabitable for decades. Uncountable wells that served communities were invaded by sea, sand, and earth; and aquifers were invaded through porous rock. On the island's east coast, the tsunami contaminated wells on which many villagers relied for drinking water.[126]\n\n\nThe Colombo-based International Water Management Institute monitored the effects of saltwater and concluded that the wells recovered to pre-tsunami drinking water quality one-and-a-half years after the event.[126] \nThe IWMI developed protocols for cleaning wells contaminated by saltwater; these were subsequently officially endorsed by the World Health Organization as part of its series of Emergency Guidelines.[127]\n\n\nSalted-over soil becomes sterile, and it is difficult and costly to restore for agriculture. It also causes the death of plants and important soil micro-organisms. Thousands of rice, mango, and banana plantations in Sri Lanka were destroyed almost entirely and will take years to recover.[126]\n\n\nIn addition to other forms of aid,[128] the Australian government sent ecological experts to help develop strategies for reef-monitoring and rehabilitation of marine environments and coral reefs in the Maldives, Seychelles and other areas. Scientists had developed significant ecological expertise from work with the Great Barrier Reef, in Australia's northeastern waters.[129]\n\n\nIn response to the unprecedented situation, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) worked with governments in the region to determine the severity of the ecological impact and how to address it.[130] UNEP established an emergency fund, set up a Task Force to respond to requests for assistance from countries affected by the tsunami, and was able to mobilize and distribute approximately US$9.3 million for environmental recovery and disaster risk reduction between 2004 and 2007. Funding came from other international agencies and from countries including Finland, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.[131][132]\n\n\nEvidence suggested that the presence of mangroves in coastal areas had provided some protection, when compared to areas that had been cleared for aquaculture or development. As a result, mangrove restoration become a focus of a number of projects, with varied success. Such approaches to ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction appear to be most successful when local communities are closely involved as stakeholders throughout the process, and when careful attention is paid to the physical conditions of chosen sites to ensure that mangroves can thrive there.[133]\n\n\n\n### Economic impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chennai's Marina Beach after the tsunami\nThe level of damage to the economy resulting from the tsunami depends on the scale examined. While the overall impact on the national economies was minor, local economies were devastated. The two main occupations affected by the tsunami were fishing and tourism.[134] \nSome economists believe that damage to the affected national economies will be minor because losses in the tourism and fishing industries are a relatively small percentage of the GDP. However, others caution that damage to infrastructure is an overriding factor. In some areas drinking water supplies and farm fields may have been contaminated for years by saltwater from the ocean.[135]\n\n\nThe impact on coastal fishing communities and the people living there, some of the poorest in the region, has been devastating with high losses of income earners as well as boats and fishing gear.[136][137] In Sri Lanka, artisanal fishery, in which the use of fish baskets, fishing traps, and spears are commonly used, is an important source of fish for local markets; industrial fishery is the major economic activity, providing direct employment to about 250,000 people. In recent years the fishery industry has emerged as a dynamic export-oriented sector, generating substantial foreign exchange earnings. Preliminary estimates indicated that 66% of the fishing fleet and industrial infrastructure in coastal regions were destroyed by the wave surges.[138]\n\n\nWhile the tsunami destroyed many of the boats vital to Sri Lanka's fishing industry, it also created a demand for fibreglass-reinforced plastic catamarans in the boatyards of Tamil Nadu. Given that over 51,000 vessels were lost to the tsunami, the industry boomed. However, the huge demand has led to lower quality in the process, and some important materials were sacrificed to cut prices for those who were impoverished by the tsunami.[139]\n\n\nEven though only coastal regions were directly affected by the waters of the tsunami, the indirect effects have spread to inland provinces as well. Since the media coverage of the event was so extensive, many tourists cancelled vacations and trips to that part of the world, even though their travel destinations may not have been affected. This ripple effect could especially be felt in the inland provinces of Thailand, such as Krabi, which acted as a starting point for many other tourist destinations in Thailand.[140]\n\n\nCountries in the region appealed to tourists to return, pointing out that most tourist infrastructure is undamaged. However, tourists were reluctant to do so for psychological reasons. Even beach resorts in parts of Thailand which were untouched by the tsunami were hit by cancellations.[141]\n\n\nBoth the earthquake and the tsunami may have affected shipping in the Malacca Straits, which separate Malaysia and the Indonesian island of Sumatra, by changing the depth of the seabed and by disturbing navigational buoys and old shipwrecks. In one area of the Strait, water depths were previously up to 1,200 m (4,000 ft), and are now only 30 m (100 ft) in some areas, making shipping impossible and dangerous. These problems also made the delivery of relief aid more challenging. Compiling new navigational charts may take months or years. Officials also hoped that piracy in the region would drop off, since the tsunami had killed pirates and destroyed their boats.[142] Due to multiple factors, there was a 71.6% drop in the number of piracy incidents between 2004 and 2005, from 60 to 17 incidents. Levels remained relatively low for some years. However, between 2013 and 2014, piracy incidents rose dramatically by 73.2% to exceed pre-tsunami levels.[143]\n\n\n\n### Historical context[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Library damage resulting from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake\n\n![Earthquakes in Sumatra](image)![2004](image)\n2004\n![1833](image)\n1833\n![2005](image)\n2005\n![1861](image)\n1861\n![2007](image)\n2007\n![1797](image)\n1797\nclass=notpageimage|\nOf the ten strongest Indonesian earthquakes ≥ 8.3 Mw, six occurred near Sumatra\n\nThe last major tsunami in the Indian Ocean was about A.D. 1400.[144][145] In 2008, a team of scientists working on Phra Thong, a barrier island along the hard-hit west coast of Thailand, reported evidence of at least three previous major tsunamis in the preceding 2,800 years, the most recent from about 700 years ago. A second team found similar evidence of previous tsunamis in Aceh, a province at the northern tip of Sumatra; radiocarbon dating of bark fragments in the soil below the second sand layer led the scientists to estimate that the most recent predecessor to the 2004 tsunami probably occurred between A.D. 1300 and 1450.[146]\n\n\nThe 2004 earthquake and tsunami combined is the world's deadliest natural disaster since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake. The earthquake was the third-most-powerful earthquake recorded since 1900. The deadliest-known earthquake in history occurred in 1556 in Shaanxi, China, with an estimated death toll of 830,000, though figures from this period may not be as reliable.[147]\n\n\nBefore 2004, the tsunami created in both Indian and Pacific Ocean waters by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, thought to have resulted in anywhere from 36,000 to 120,000 deaths, had probably been the deadliest in the region. In 1782, about 40,000 people are thought to have been killed by a tsunami (or a cyclone) in the South China Sea.[148] The deadliest tsunami before 2004 was Italy's 1908 Messina earthquake on the Mediterranean Sea where the earthquake and tsunami killed about 123,000.[149]\n\n\n\n### Other effects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsunami aftermath in Aceh, Indonesia\nMany health professionals and aid workers have reported widespread psychological trauma associated with the tsunami.[150] Even 14 years afterwards, researchers find HPA axis dysregulation and “burnout” in survivors.[151] Traditional beliefs in many of the affected regions state that a relative of the family must bury the body of the dead, and in many cases, no body remained to be buried. Women in Aceh required a special approach from foreign aid agencies, and continue to have unique needs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe hardest-hit area, Aceh, is a religiously conservative Islamic society and has had no tourism nor any Western presence in recent years due to the insurgency between the Indonesian military and Free Aceh Movement (GAM). Some believe that the tsunami was divine punishment for lay Muslims shirking their daily prayers or following a materialistic lifestyle. Others have said that Allah was angry that Muslims were killing each other in an ongoing conflict.[152] Saudi cleric Muhammad Al-Munajjid attributed it to divine retribution against non-Muslim vacationers \"who used to sprawl all over the beaches and in pubs overflowing with wine\" during Christmas break.[153]\n\n\nThe widespread devastation caused by the tsunami led GAM to declare a cease-fire on 28 December 2004 followed by the Indonesian government, and the two groups resumed long-stalled peace talks, which resulted in a peace agreement signed 15 August 2005. The agreement explicitly cites the tsunami as a justification.[154]\n\n\nIn a poll conducted in 27 countries, 15% of respondents named the tsunami the most significant event of the year. Only the Iraq War was named by as many respondents.[155][156] The extensive international media coverage of the tsunami, and the role of mass media and journalists in reconstruction, were discussed by editors of newspapers and broadcast media in tsunami-affected areas, in special video-conferences set up by the Asia Pacific Journalism Centre.[157]\n\n\nThe tsunami left both the people and government of India in a state of heightened alert. On 30 December 2004, four days after the tsunami, Terra Research notified the India government that its sensors indicated there was a possibility of 7.9 to 8.1 magnitude tectonic shift in the next 12 hours between Sumatra and New Zealand.[158] In response, the Indian Minister of Home Affairs announced that a fresh onslaught of deadly tsunami was likely along the southern Indian coast and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, even as there was no sign of turbulence in the region.[158] The announcement generated panic in the Indian Ocean region and caused thousands to flee their homes, which resulted in jammed roads.[159] The announcement was a false alarm, and the Home Affairs minister withdrew their announcement.[159] On further investigation, the India government learned that the consulting company Terra Research was run from the home of a self-described earthquake forecaster who had no telephone listing and maintained a website where he sold copies of his detection system.[160]\n\n\n\n![](image)Patong Beach in Thailand after the tsunami\nThe tsunami had a severe humanitarian and political impact in Sweden. The hardest-hit country outside Asia, Sweden, lost 543 tourists, mainly in Thailand. The Persson Cabinet was heavily criticized for its inaction.[161]\n\n\nSmith Dharmasaroja, a meteorologist who had predicted that an earthquake and tsunami \"is going to occur for sure\" way back in 1994,[162][163] was assigned the development of the Thai tsunami warning system. The Indian Ocean Tsunami warning system was formed in early 2005 to provide an early warning of tsunamis for inhabitants around the Indian Ocean coasts.[164]\n\n\n\nThe changes in the distribution of masses inside the Earth due to the earthquake had several consequences. It displaced the North Pole by 25 mm (0.98 in). It also slightly changed the shape of the Earth, specifically by decreasing Earth's oblateness by about one part in 10 billion, consequentially increasing Earth's rotation a little and thus shortening the length of the day by 2.68 microseconds.[165]\n\n\n## Humanitarian response[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake\n\n![](image)German tsunami relief mission visiting Mullaitivu in Sri Lanka's Northern Province\nA great deal of humanitarian aid was needed because of widespread damage to the infrastructure, shortages of food and water, and economic damage. Epidemics were of particular concern due to the high population density and tropical climate of the affected areas. The main concern of humanitarian and government agencies was to provide sanitation facilities and fresh drinking water to contain the spread of diseases such as cholera, diphtheria, dysentery, typhoid and hepatitis A and hepatitis B.\n\n\nThere was also a great concern that the death toll could increase as disease and hunger spread. However, because of the initial quick response, this was minimized.[166]\n\n\nIn the days following the tsunami, significant effort was spent in burying bodies hurriedly due to fear of disease spreading. However, the public health risks may have been exaggerated, and therefore this may not have been the best way to allocate resources.[167][168] The World Food Programme provided food aid to more than 1.3 million people affected by the tsunami.[169]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Health risks from dead bodies\n\nNations all over the world provided over US$14 billion in aid for damaged regions,[170] with the governments of Australia pledging US$819.9 million (including a US$760.6 million aid package for Indonesia), Germany offering US$660 million, Japan offering US$500 million, Canada offering US$343 million, Norway and the Netherlands offering both US$183 million, the United States offering US$35 million initially (increased to US$350 million), and the World Bank offering US$250 million. Also, Italy offered US$95 million, increased later to US$113 million of which US$42 million was donated by the population using the SMS system.[171] Australia, India, Japan and the United States formed an ad-hoc corroborative group, and it was the origin of Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.[172]\n\n\n\n![](image)Memorial dedicated to victims of the tsunami, Batticaloa, in Sri Lanka\nAccording to USAID, the US has pledged additional funds in long-term U.S. support to help the tsunami victims rebuild their lives. On 9 February 2005, President Bush asked Congress to increase the U.S. commitment to a total of US$950 million. Officials estimated that billions of dollars would be needed. Bush also asked his father, former President George H. W. Bush, and former President Bill Clinton to lead a U.S. effort to provide private aid to the tsunami victims.[173]\n\n\nIn mid-March, the Asian Development Bank reported that over US$4 billion in aid promised by governments was behind schedule. Sri Lanka reported that it had received no foreign government aid, while foreign individuals had been generous.[174] Many charities were given considerable donations from the public. For example, in the United Kingdom, the public donated roughly £330 million sterling (nearly US$600 million). This considerably outweighed the allocation by the government to disaster relief and reconstruction of £75 million and came to an average of about £5.50 (US$10) donated by every citizen.[175][176]\n\n\nIn August 2006, fifteen local aid staff working on post-tsunami rebuilding were found executed in north-east Sri Lanka after heavy fighting between government troops and the Tamil Tiger rebels, the main umbrella body for aid agencies in the country said.[177]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n### Film and television[edit]\n\n\n* *Children of Tsunami: No More Tears* (2005), a 24-minute documentary\n* *The Wave That Shook The World* (2005), educational television-series documentary about the tsunami\n* *Tsunami: The Aftermath* (2006), a two-part television miniseries about its aftermath\n* *Dasavathaaram* (2008), a Tamil thriller film involving the tsunami\n* *Hereafter* (2010), a main character's life is affected after surviving the tsunami while on vacation\n* *Hafalan Shalat Delisa* (2011), an Indonesian movie with the tsunami as the initial incident\n* *The Impossible* (2012), an English-language Spanish film based on the story of María Belón and her family\n* *Kayal* (2014), a Tamil drama film which culminates with the tsunami\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\n* *Paint the Sky with Stars: Selected Poetry in Remembrance of the Boxing Day Tsunami 2004* (2005) edited by Stephen Robert Kuta[178]\n* *The Killing Sea* (2006), two teenagers struggle to survive in the days after the tsunami[179]\n* *Wave* (2013), a memoir by Sonali Deraniyagala\n* *On the Island* (2012), two people stranded on a Maldives uninhabited island are rescued because of the tsunami.\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n* \"12/26\" by Kimya Dawson, about the event and the humanitarian efforts, from the perspective of a victim whose family died in the disaster.\n* \"Where the Wave Broke\" by Burst, written in memory of Mieszko Talarczyk, frontman of Swedish grindcore band Nasum (whom Burst bassist Jesper Liveröd also performed with), who died in the disaster, which led to Nasum's subsequent disbandment.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nScholia has a *topic* profile for ***2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami***.\n\n* Deaths in December 2004 – notable people killed in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami\n* List of earthquakes in 2004\n* List of earthquakes in Indonesia\n* List of natural disasters by death toll\n* Lists of earthquakes\n* List of megathrust earthquakes\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** National Earthquake Information Center (26 December 2004). \"M 9.1 - 2004 Sumatra - Andaman Islands Earthquake\".

The undersea megathrust earthquake, known by the scientific community as the **Sumatra–Andaman earthquake**,[10][11] was caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma Plate and the Indian Plate, and reached a Mercalli intensity up to IX in some areas.\n\n\nA massive tsunami with waves up to 30 m (100 ft) high, known in some countries as the **Boxing Day Tsunami** after the Boxing Day holiday, devastated communities along the surrounding coasts of the Indian Ocean, killing an estimated 227,898 people in 14 countries in one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. The direct results caused major disruptions to living conditions and commerce in coastal provinces of surrounded countries, including Aceh (Indonesia), Sri Lanka, Tamil Nadu (India) and Khao Lak (Thailand). Banda Aceh reported the largest number of deaths. It remains the deadliest natural disaster of the 21st century.[12]\n\n\nIt was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Asia, the most powerful earthquake in the 21st century, and at least the third most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the world since modern seismography began in 1900. It had the longest duration of faulting ever observed, between eight and ten minutes.[13] It caused the planet to vibrate as much as 10 mm (0.4 in),[14] and also remotely triggered earthquakes as far away as Alaska.[15] Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Sumatra.[16] The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response, with donations totalling more than US$14 billion[17] (equivalent to US$23 billion in 2023 currency).\n\n\n\n\n## Earthquake[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2004 Indian Oceanearthquake and tsunami |\n| --- |\n| ![A sped-up animated graphic of Earth that shows tsunami waves as they ripple across the ocean, away from the earthquake epicenter.](image) |\n| Countries affected |\n| * India\n* Indonesia\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Myanmar\n* Somalia\n* Sri Lanka\n* Thailand\n |\n| * Indirect: Finland\n* Norway\n |\n| Humanitarian response |\n| * Classic Response\n* Football for Hope\n* Music for Relief\n* Reach Out to Asia\n* Rugby Aid\n* Tsunami Relief Cardiff\n* UK Radio Aid\n* WaveAid\n* World Cricket Tsunami Appeal\n |\n| \nMilitary operations |\n| * *Garron*\n* *Sumatra Assist*\n* *Unified Assistance*\n |\n| \nRelated topics |\n| * Library damage\n* Sri Lanka train wreck\n\n---\n |\n| * Category\n* Commons\n* Timeline\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n![](image)USGS Shakemap for the event\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was initially documented as having a moment magnitude of 8.8. In February 2005, scientists revised the estimate of the magnitude to 9.0.[18] Although the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has accepted these new numbers, the United States Geological Survey has, as of 2022, so far not changed its estimate of 9.1.[19] A 2006 study estimated a magnitude of Mw 9.1–9.3; Hiroo Kanamori of the California Institute of Technology estimates that Mw 9.2 is representative of the earthquake's size.[20]\n\n\nThe hypocentre of the main earthquake was approximately 160 km (100 mi) off the western coast of northern Sumatra, in the Indian Ocean just north of Simeulue island at a depth of 30 km (19 mi) below mean sea level (initially reported as 10 km or 6.2 mi). The northern section of the Sunda megathrust ruptured over a length of 1,300 km (810 mi).[16] The earthquake (followed by the tsunami) was felt in Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.[21] Splay faults, or secondary \"pop up faults\", caused long, narrow parts of the seafloor to pop up in seconds. This quickly elevated the height and increased the speed of waves, destroying the nearby Indonesian town of Lhoknga.[22]\n\n\nIndonesia lies between the Pacific Ring of Fire along the north-eastern islands adjacent to New Guinea, and the Alpide belt that runs along the south and west from Sumatra, Java, Bali, Flores to Timor. The 2002 Sumatra earthquake is believed to have been a foreshock, preceding the main event by over two years.[23]\n\n\n\n### Historical comparisons[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of megathrust earthquakes\n\nGreat earthquakes, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, are associated with megathrust events in subduction zones. Their seismic moments can account for a significant fraction of the global seismic moment across century-scale periods. Of all the moment released by earthquakes in the 100 years from 1906 through 2005, roughly one eighth was due to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.[24] This quake, together with the Great Alaskan earthquake (1964) and the Great Chilean earthquake (1960), account for almost half of the total moment.[24][25]\n\n\nSince 1900, the only earthquakes recorded with a greater magnitude were the 1960 Valdivia earthquake (magnitude 9.5) and the 1964 Alaska earthquake in Prince William Sound (magnitude 9.2). The only other recorded earthquakes of magnitude 9.0 or greater were off Kamchatka, Russia, on 5 November 1952 (magnitude 9.0) and Tōhoku, Japan (magnitude 9.1) in March 2011. Each of these megathrust earthquakes also spawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean. In comparison to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the death toll from these earthquakes and tsunamis was significantly lower, primarily because of the lower population density along the coasts near affected areas.[10]\n\n\nComparisons with earlier earthquakes are difficult, as earthquake strength were not measured systematically until the 1930s.[26] However, historical earthquake strength can sometimes be estimated by examining historical descriptions of the damage caused, and the geological records of the areas where they occurred.[27] Some examples of significant historical megathrust earthquakes are the 1868 Arica earthquake in Peru and the 1700 Cascadia earthquake in western North America.\n\n\n\n### Tectonic plates[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Plate tectonics\n\n![](image)Epicentre and associated aftershocks\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was unusually large in geographical and geological extent. An estimated 1,600 km (1,000 mi) of fault surface slipped (or ruptured) about 15 m (50 ft) along the subduction zone where the Indian Plate slides under (or subducts) the overriding Burma Plate. The slip did not happen instantaneously but took place in two phases over several minutes:\nSeismographic and acoustic data indicate that the first phase involved a rupture about 400 km (250 mi) long and 100 km (60 mi) wide, 30 km (19 mi) beneath the sea bed—the largest rupture ever known to have been caused by an earthquake. The rupture proceeded at about 2.8 km/s (1.74 mi/s; 10,100 km/h; 6,260 mph), beginning off the coast of Aceh and proceeding north-westerly over about 100 seconds.\nAfter a pause of about another 100 seconds, the rupture continued northwards towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The northern rupture occurred more slowly than in the south, at about 2.1 km/s (1.3 mi/s; 7,600 km/h; 4,700 mph), continuing north for another five minutes to a plate boundary where the fault type changes from subduction to strike-slip (the two plates slide past one another in opposite directions).\n\n\nThe Indian Plate is part of the great Indo-Australian Plate, which underlies the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, and is moving north-east at an average of 60 mm/a (0.075 in/Ms). The India Plate meets the Burma Plate (which is considered a portion of the great Eurasian Plate) at the Sunda Trench. At this point, the India Plate subducts beneath the Burma Plate, which carries the Nicobar Islands, the Andaman Islands, and northern Sumatra. The India Plate sinks deeper and deeper beneath the Burma Plate until the increasing temperature and pressure drive volatiles out of the subducting plate. These volatiles rise into the overlying plate, causing partial melting and the formation of magma. The rising magma intrudes into the crust above and exits the Earth's crust through volcanoes in the form of a volcanic arc. The volcanic activity that results as the Indo-Australian Plate subducts the Eurasian Plate has created the Sunda Arc.\n\n\nAs well as the sideways movement between the plates, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake resulted in a rise of the seafloor by several metres, displacing an estimated 30 km3 (7.2 cu mi) of water and triggering devastating tsunami waves. The waves radiated outwards along the entire 1,600 km (1,000 mi) length of the rupture (acting as a line source). This greatly increased the geographical area over which the waves were observed, reaching as far as Mexico, Chile, and the Arctic. The raising of the seafloor significantly reduced the capacity of the Indian Ocean, producing a permanent rise in the global sea level by an estimated 0.1 mm (0.004 in).[28]\n\n\n\n### Aftershocks and other earthquakes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of earthquakes in Indonesia and List of earthquakes in 2004\n\n![](image)Initial earthquake and aftershocks measuring greater than 4.0 Mw  from 26 December 2004 to 10 January 2005\n![](image)Aftershocks of 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake\nNumerous aftershocks were reported off the Andaman Islands, the Nicobar Islands and the region of the original epicentre in the hours and days that followed. The magnitude 8.7 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, which originated off the coast of the Sumatran island of Nias, is not considered an aftershock, despite its proximity to the epicentre, and was most likely triggered by stress changes associated with the 2004 event.[29] The earthquake produced its own aftershocks (some registering a magnitude of as high as 6.1) and presently ranks as the third-largest earthquake ever recorded on the moment magnitude or Richter magnitude scale.\n\n\nOther aftershocks of up to magnitude 6.6 continued to shake the region daily for three or four months.[30] As well as continuing aftershocks, the energy released by the original earthquake continued to make its presence felt well after the event. A week after the earthquake, its reverberations could still be measured, providing valuable scientific data about the Earth's interior.\n\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake came just three days after a magnitude 8.1 earthquake in the sub-antarctic Auckland Islands, an uninhabited region west of New Zealand, and Macquarie Island to Australia's north. This is unusual since earthquakes of magnitude eight or more occur only about once per year on average.[31] The U.S. Geological Survey sees no evidence of a causal relationship between these events.[32]\n\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is thought to have triggered activity in both Leuser Mountain[33] and Mount Talang,[34] volcanoes in Aceh along the same range of peaks, while the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake had sparked activity in Lake Toba, an ancient crater in Sumatra.[35]\n\n\n\n### Energy released[edit]\n\n\nThe energy released on the Earth's surface (*M*E, which is the *seismic potential for damage*) by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was estimated at 1.1×1017 joules (110 PJ; 26 Mt).[36] This energy is equivalent to over 1,500 times that of the Hiroshima atomic bomb, but less than that of Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated.[37]\n\n\nThe earthquake generated a seismic oscillation of the Earth's surface of up to 200–300 mm (8–12 in), equivalent to the effect of the tidal forces caused by the Sun and Moon. The seismic waves of the earthquake were felt across the planet, as far away as the U.S. state of Oklahoma, where vertical movements of 3 mm (0.12 in) were recorded. By February 2005, the earthquake's effects were still detectable as a 20 μm (0.02 mm; 0.0008 in) complex harmonic oscillation of the Earth's surface, which gradually diminished and merged with the incessant free oscillation of the Earth more than four months after the earthquake.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vertical-component ground motions recorded by the Global Seismographic Network and displayed by the IRIS Consortium\nBecause of its enormous energy release and shallow rupture depth, the earthquake generated remarkable seismic ground motions around the globe, particularly due to huge Rayleigh (surface) elastic waves that exceeded 10 mm (0.4 in) in vertical amplitude everywhere on Earth. The record section plot displays vertical displacements of the Earth's surface recorded by seismometers from the IRIS/USGS Global Seismographic Network plotted with respect to time (since the earthquake initiation) on the horizontal axis, and vertical displacements of the Earth on the vertical axis (note the 1 cm scale bar at the bottom for scale). The seismograms are arranged vertically by distance from the epicentre in degrees. The earliest, lower amplitude signal is that of the compressional (P) wave, which takes about 22 minutes to reach the other side of the planet (the antipode; in this case near Ecuador). The largest amplitude signals are seismic surface waves that reach the antipode after about 100 minutes. The surface waves can be clearly seen to reinforce near the antipode (with the closest seismic stations in Ecuador), and to subsequently encircle the planet to return to the epicentral region after about 200 minutes. A major aftershock (magnitude 7.1) can be seen at the closest stations starting just after the 200-minute mark. The aftershock would be considered a major earthquake under ordinary circumstances but is dwarfed by the mainshock.\n\n\nThe shift of mass and the massive release of energy slightly altered the Earth's rotation. Weeks after the earthquake, theoretical models suggested the earthquake shortened the length of a day by 2.68 microseconds, due to a decrease in the oblateness of the Earth. [39] It also caused the Earth to minutely \"wobble\" on its axis by up to 25 mm (1 in) in the direction of 145° east longitude,[40] or perhaps by up to 50 or 60 mm (2.0 or 2.4 in).[41] Because of tidal effects of the Moon, the length of a day increases at an average of 15 microseconds per year, so any rotational change due to the earthquake will be lost quickly. Similarly, the natural Chandler wobble of the Earth, which in some cases can be up to 15 m (50 ft), eventually offset the minor wobble produced by the earthquake.\n\n\nThere was 10 m (33 ft) movement laterally and 4–5 m (13–16 ft) vertically along the fault line. Early speculation was that some of the smaller islands south-west of Sumatra, which is on the Burma Plate (the southern regions are on the Sunda Plate), might have moved south-west by up to 36 m (120 ft), but more accurate data released more than a month after the earthquake found the movement to be about 0.2 m (8 in).[42] Since movement was vertical as well as lateral, some coastal areas may have been moved to below sea level. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands appear to have shifted south-west by around 1.25 m (4 ft 1 in) and to have sunk by 1 m (3 ft 3 in).[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Seismic moment release of the largest earthquakes from 1906 to 2005\nIn February 2005, the Royal Navy vessel HMS *Scott* surveyed the seabed around the earthquake zone, which varies in depth between 1,000 and 5,000 m (550 and 2,730 fathoms; 3,300 and 16,400 ft). The survey, conducted using a high-resolution, multi-beam sonar system, revealed that the earthquake had made a considerable impact on the topography of the seabed. 1,500-metre-high (5,000 ft) thrust ridges created by previous geologic activity along the fault had collapsed, generating landslides several kilometres wide. One such landslide consisted of a single block of rock some 100 m (330 ft) high and 2 km (1.2 mi) long. The momentum of the water displaced by tectonic uplift had also dragged massive slabs of rock, each weighing millions of tonnes, as far as 10 km (6 mi) across the seabed. An oceanic trench several kilometres wide was exposed in the earthquake zone.[44]\n\n\nThe TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 satellites happened to pass over the tsunami as it was crossing the ocean.[45] These satellites carry radars that measure precisely the height of the water surface; anomalies in the order of 500 mm (20 in) were measured. Measurements from these satellites may prove invaluable for the understanding of the earthquake and tsunami.[46] Unlike data from tide gauges installed on shores, measurements obtained in the middle of the ocean can be used for computing the parameters of the source earthquake without having to compensate for the complex ways in which proximity to the coast changes the size and shape of a wave.\n\n\n\n## Tsunami[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The tsunami's propagation took 5 hours to reach Western Australia, 7 hours to reach the Arabian Peninsula, and did not reach the South African coast until nearly 11 hours after the earthquake\nThe sudden vertical rise of the seabed by several metres during the earthquake displaced massive volumes of water, resulting in a tsunami that struck the coasts of the Indian Ocean. A tsunami that causes damage far away from its source is sometimes called a teletsunami and is much more likely to be produced by the vertical motion of the seabed than by horizontal motion.[47]\n\n\nThe tsunami, like all others, behaved differently in deep water than in shallow water. In deep ocean water, tsunami waves form only a low, broad hump, barely noticeable and harmless, which generally travels at high speed of 500 to 1,000 km/h (310 to 620 mph); in shallow water near coastlines, a tsunami slows down to only tens of kilometres per hour but, in doing so, forms large destructive waves. Scientists investigating the damage in Aceh found evidence that the wave reached a height of 24 m (80 ft) when coming ashore along large stretches of the coastline, rising to 30 m (100 ft) in some areas when travelling inland.[4] Radar satellites recorded the heights of tsunami waves in deep water: maximum height was at 600 mm (2 ft) two hours after the earthquake, the first such observations ever made.[48][49]\n\n\nAccording to Tad Murty, vice-president of the Tsunami Society, the total energy of the tsunami waves was equivalent to about 5 megatons of TNT (21 PJ), which is more than twice the total explosive energy used during all of World War II (including the two atomic bombs) but still a couple of orders of magnitude less than the energy released in the earthquake itself. In many places, the waves reached as far as 2 km (1.2 mi) inland.[50]\n\n\nBecause the 1,600 km (1,000 mi) fault affected by the earthquake was in a nearly north–south orientation, the greatest strength of the tsunami waves was in an east–west direction. Bangladesh, which lies at the northern end of the Bay of Bengal, had few casualties despite being a low-lying country relatively near the epicentre. It also benefited from the fact that the earthquake proceeded more slowly in the northern rupture zone, greatly reducing the energy of the water displacements in that region.\n\n\n\n![](image)Average height of the waves\nCoasts that have a landmass between them and the tsunami's location of origin are usually safe; however, tsunami waves can sometimes diffract around such landmasses. Thus, the state of Kerala was hit by the tsunami despite being on the western coast of India, and the western coast of Sri Lanka suffered substantial impacts. Distance alone was no guarantee of safety, as Somalia was hit harder than Bangladesh despite being much farther away.\n\n\nBecause of the distances involved, the tsunami took anywhere from fifteen minutes to seven hours to reach the coastlines.[51][52] The northern regions of the Indonesian island of Sumatra were hit quickly, while Sri Lanka and the east coast of India were hit roughly 90 minutes to two hours later. Thailand was struck about two hours later despite being closer to the epicentre because the tsunami travelled more slowly in the shallow Andaman Sea off its western coast.\n\n\nThe tsunami was noticed as far as Struisbaai in South Africa, about 8,500 km (5,300 mi) away, where a 1.5-metre-high (5 ft) tide surged on shore about 16 hours after the earthquake. It took a relatively long time to reach Struisbaai at the southernmost point of Africa, probably because of the broad continental shelf off South Africa and because the tsunami would have followed the South African coast from east to west. The tsunami also reached Antarctica, where tidal gauges at Japan's Showa Base recorded oscillations of up to a metre (3 ft 3 in), with disturbances lasting a couple of days.[53]\n\n\nSome of the tsunami's energy escaped into the Pacific Ocean, where it produced small but measurable tsunamis along the western coasts of North and South America, typically around 200 to 400 mm (7.9 to 15.7 in).[54] At Manzanillo, Mexico, a 2.6 m (8.5 ft) crest-to-trough tsunami was measured. As well, the tsunami was large enough to be detected in Vancouver, which puzzled many scientists, as the tsunamis measured in some parts of South America were larger than those measured in some parts of the Indian Ocean. It has been theorized that the tsunamis were focused and directed at long ranges by the mid-ocean ridges which run along the margins of the continental plates.[55]\n\n\n\n### Early signs and warnings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Maximum recession of tsunami waters at Kata Noi Beach at 10:25 a.m., prior to the third—and strongest—tsunami wave\nDespite a delay of up to several hours between the earthquake and the impact of the tsunami, nearly all of the victims were taken by surprise. There were no tsunami warning systems in the Indian Ocean to detect tsunamis or to warn the general population living around the ocean.[56] Tsunami detection is not easy because while a tsunami is in deep water, it has little height and a network of sensors is needed to detect it.\n\n\nTsunamis are more frequent in the Pacific Ocean than in other oceans because of earthquakes in the \"Ring of Fire\". Although the extreme western edge of the Ring of Fire extends into the Indian Ocean (the point where the earthquake struck), no warning system exists in that ocean. Tsunamis there are relatively rare despite earthquakes being relatively frequent in Indonesia. The last major tsunami was caused by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. Not every earthquake produces large tsunamis: on 28 March 2005, a magnitude 8.7 earthquake hit roughly the same area of the Indian Ocean but did not result in a major tsunami.\n\n\nThe first warning sign of a possible tsunami is the earthquake itself. However, tsunamis can strike thousands of kilometres away where the earthquake is felt only weakly or not at all. Also, in the minutes preceding a tsunami strike, the sea sometimes recedes temporarily from the coast, which was observed on the eastern earthquake rupture zone such as the coastlines of Aceh, Phuket island, and Khao Lak area in Thailand, Penang island of Malaysia, and the Andaman and Nicobar islands. This rare sight reportedly induced people, especially children, to visit the coast to investigate and collect stranded fish on as much as 2.5 km (1.6 mi) of exposed beach, with fatal results.[57] However, not all tsunamis cause this \"disappearing sea\" effect. In some cases, there are no warning signs at all: the sea will suddenly swell without retreating, surprising many people and giving them little time to flee.\n\n\n\nTsunami wave field in the Bay of Bengal an hour after the earthquake\nOne of the few coastal areas to evacuate ahead of the tsunami was on the Indonesian island of Simeulue, close to the epicentre. Island folklore recounted an earthquake and tsunami in 1907, and the islanders fled to inland hills after the initial shaking and before the tsunami struck. These tales and oral folklore from previous generations may have helped the survival of the inhabitants.[58] On Maikhao Beach in north Phuket City, Thailand, a 10-year-old British tourist named Tilly Smith had studied tsunamis in geography at school and recognised the warning signs of the receding ocean and frothing bubbles. She and her parents warned others on the beach, which was evacuated safely.[59] John Chroston, a biology teacher from Scotland, also recognised the signs at Kamala Bay north of Phuket, taking a busload of vacationers and locals to safety on higher ground.\n\n\nAnthropologists had initially expected the aboriginal population of the Andaman Islands to be badly affected by the tsunami and even feared the already depopulated Onge tribe could have been wiped out.[60] Many of the aboriginal tribes evacuated and suffered fewer casualties, however.[61][62] Oral traditions developed from previous earthquakes helped the aboriginal tribes escape the tsunami. For example, the folklore of the Onges talks of \"huge shaking of ground followed by high wall of water\". Almost all of the Onge people seemed to have survived the tsunami.[63]\n\n\n\n### Indonesia[edit]\n\n\n#### Aceh[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsunami inundation height can be seen on a house in Banda Aceh\nThe tsunami devastated the coastline of Aceh province, about 20 minutes after the earthquake. Banda Aceh, the closest major city, suffered severe casualties. The sea receded and exposed the seabed, prompting locals to collect stranded fish and explore the area. Local eyewitnesses described three large waves, with the first wave rising gently to the foundation of the buildings, followed minutes later by a sudden withdrawal of the sea near the port of Ulèë Lheue. This was succeeded by the appearance of two large black-coloured steep waves which then travelled inland into the capital city as a large turbulent bore. Eyewitnesses described the tsunami as a \"black giant\", \"mountain\" and a \"wall of water\". Video footage revealed torrents of black water, surging by windows of a two-story residential area situated about 3.2 km (2.0 mi) inland. Additionally, amateur footage recorded in the middle of the city captured an approaching black surge flowing down the city streets, full of debris, inundating them.[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Apung 1*, a 2,600-ton vessel, was flung some 2 km (1.2 mi) to 3 km (1.9 mi) inland. In the years following the disaster, it became a local tourist attraction and has remained where it came to rest.\nThe level of destruction was extreme on the northwestern areas of the city, immediately inland of the aquaculture ponds, and directly facing the Indian Ocean. The tsunami height was reduced from 12 m (39 ft) at Ulee Lheue to 6 m (20 ft) a further 8 km (5.0 mi) to the north-east. The inundation was observed to extend 3–4 km (1.9–2.5 mi) inland throughout the city. Within 2–3 km (1.2–1.9 mi) of the shoreline, houses, except for strongly-built reinforced concrete ones with brick walls, which seemed to have been partially damaged by the earthquake before the tsunami attack, were swept away or destroyed by the tsunami.[65][66]\nThe area toward the sea was wiped clean of nearly every structure, while closer to the river, dense construction in a commercial district showed the effects of severe flooding. The flow depth at the city was just at the level of the second floor, and there were large amounts of debris piled along the streets and in the ground-floor storefronts. In the seaside section of Ulee Lheue, the flow depths were over 9 m (30 ft). Footage showed evidence of back-flowing of the Aceh River, carrying debris and people from destroyed villages at the coast and transporting them up to 40 km (25 mi) inland.[67]\n\n\nA group of small islands: Weh, Breueh, Nasi, Teunom, Bunta, Lumpat, and Batee lie just north of the capital city. The tsunami reached a run-up of 10–20 m (33–66 ft) on the western shorelines of Breueh Island and Nasi Island. Coastal villages were destroyed by the waves. On the island of Pulau Weh, strong surges were experienced in the port of Sabang, yet there was little damage with reported runup values of 3–5 m (9.8–16.4 ft), most likely due to the island being sheltered from the direct attack by the islands to the south-west.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)Overturned cement carrier in Lhoknga\nLhoknga is a small coastal community about 13 km (8.1 mi) south-west of Banda Aceh, located on a flat coastal plain in between two rainforest-covered hills, overlooking a large bay and famous for its large swathe of white sandy beach and surfing activities. The locals reported 10 to 12 waves, with the second and third being the highest and most destructive. Interviews with the locals revealed that the sea temporarily receded and exposed coral reefs. In the distant horizon, gigantic black waves about 30 m (98 ft) high made explosion-like sounds as it broke and approached the shore. The first wave came rapidly landward from the south-west as a turbulent bore about 0.5–2.5 m (1.6–8.2 ft) high. The second and third waves were 15–30 m (49–98 ft) high at the coast and appeared like gigantic surfing waves but \"taller than the coconut trees and was like a mountain\".[68] The second wave was the largest; it came from the west-southwest within five minutes of the first wave. The tsunami stranded cargo ships, barges and destroyed a cement mining facility near the Lampuuk coast, where it reached the fourth level of the building.[5][69][70]\n\n\n\n![](image)Baiturrahim Mosque survived the tsunami in Ulee Lheue, Banda Aceh\nMeulaboh, a remote coastal city, was among the hardest hit by the tsunami. The waves arrived after the sea receded about 500 m (1,600 ft), followed by an advancing small tsunami. The second and third destructive waves arrived later, which exceeded the height of the coconut trees. The inundation distance is about 5 km (3.1 mi). Other towns on Aceh's west coast hit by the disaster included Leupung, Lhokruet, Lamno, Patek, Calang, and Teunom. Affected or destroyed towns on the region's north and east coast were Pidie Regency, Samalanga, Panteraja, and Lhokseumawe. The high fatality rate in the area was mainly due to lack of preparation of the community towards a tsunami and limited knowledge and education among the population regarding the natural phenomenon. Helicopter surveys showed entire settlements virtually destroyed with destruction within miles inland, and only some mosques left standing.[71]\n\n\nThe greatest run-up height of the tsunami was measured at a hill between Lhoknga and Leupung, on the western coast of the northern tip of Sumatra, near Banda Aceh, and reached 51 m (167 ft).[5][72]\n\n\nThe tsunami heights in Sumatra:[65]\n\n\n\n* 15–30 m (49–98 ft) on the west coast of Aceh\n* 6–12 m (20–39 ft) on the Banda Aceh coast\n* 6 m (20 ft) on the Krueng Raya coast\n* 5 m (16 ft) on the Sigli coast\n* 3–6 m (9.8–19.7 ft) on the north coast of Weh Island directly facing the tsunami source\n* 3 m (9.8 ft) on the opposite side of the coast of Weh Island facing the tsunami\n\n\n### Sri Lanka[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fishing boat stranded in Batticaloa\nThe island country of Sri Lanka, located about 1,700 km (1,100 mi) from Sumatra, was ravaged by the tsunami around 2 hours after the earthquake. The tsunami first struck the eastern coastline and subsequently refracted around the southern point of Sri Lanka (Dondra Head). The refracted tsunami waves then inundated the southwestern part of Sri Lanka after some of its energy was reflected from impact with the Maldives.[73] In Sri Lanka, the civilian casualties were second only to those in Indonesia, with approximately 35,000 killed. The eastern shores of Sri Lanka were the hardest hit since it faced the epicentre of the earthquake, while the southwestern shores were hit later, but the death toll was just as severe. The southwestern shores are a hotspot for tourists and fishing.[74] The degradation of the natural environment in Sri Lanka contributed to the high death tolls. Approximately 90,000 buildings and many wooden houses were destroyed.[74]\n\n\nThe tsunami arrived on the island as a small brown-orange-coloured flood. Moments later, the ocean floor was exposed as much as 1 km (0.62 mi) in places, which was followed by massive second and third waves. Amateur video recorded at the city of Galle showed a large deluge flooding the city, carrying debris and sweeping away people while in the coastal resort town of Beruwala, the tsunami appeared as a huge brown-orange-coloured bore which reached the first level of a hotel, causing destruction and taking people unaware. Other videos recorded showed that the tsunami appeared like a flood raging inland. The construction of seawalls and breakwaters reduced the power of waves at some locations.\n\n\nThe largest run-up measured was at 12.5 m (41 ft) with inundation distance of 390–1,500 m (1,280–4,920 ft) in Yala.[75] In Hambantota, run-ups measured 11 m (36 ft) with the greatest inundation distance of 2 km (1.2 mi). Run-up measurements along the Sri Lankan coasts are at 2.4–4.11 m (7 ft 10 in – 13 ft 6 in).[75][73] Waves measured on the east coast ranged from 4.5–9 m (15–30 ft) at Pottuvill to Batticaloa at 2.6–5 m (8 ft 6 in – 16 ft 5 in) in the north-east around Trincomalee and 4–5 m (13–16 ft) in the west coast from Moratuwa to Ambalangoda.\n\n\nSri Lanka tsunami height survey:\n\n\n\n* 9 m (30 ft) at Koggala\n* 6 m (20 ft) at Galle port\n* 4.8 m (16 ft) around the Galle coast\n* 8.7 m (29 ft) at Nonagama\n* 4.9 m (16 ft) at Weligama\n* 4 m (13 ft) at Dodundawa\n* 4.7 m (15 ft) at Ambalangoda\n* 4.7 m (15 ft) at Hikkaduwa Fishery Harbour\n* 10 m (33 ft) at Kahawa\n* 4.8 m (16 ft) at North Beach of Beruwala\n* 6 m (20 ft) at Paiyagala\n\n\nA regular passenger train operating between Maradana and Matara was derailed and overturned by the tsunami and claimed at least 1,700 lives, the largest single rail disaster death toll in history.[76] Estimates based on the state of the shoreline and a high-water mark on a nearby building place the tsunami 7.5–9 m (25–30 ft) above sea level and 2–3 m (6 ft 7 in – 9 ft 10 in) higher than the top of the train.\n\n\n\n### Thailand[edit]\n\n\nThe tsunami travelled eastward through the Andaman Sea and hit the south-western coasts of Thailand, about 2 hours after the earthquake. Located about 500 km (310 mi) from the epicentre, at the time, the region was popular with tourists because of Christmas. Many of these tourists were caught off-guard by the tsunami, as they had no prior warning. The tsunami hit during high tide. Major locations damaged included the western shores of Phuket island, the resort town of Khao Lak in Phang Nga Province, the coastal provinces of Krabi, Satun, Ranong and Trang and small offshore islands like Ko Racha Yai, the Phi Phi islands, the Surin Islands and the Similan archipelago. Approximately 8,000 people were killed.\n\n\nThailand experienced the second largest tsunami run-up. The tsunami heights recorded:[77][78]\n\n\n\n![](image)Thai Navy boat stranded almost 2 km (1.2 mi) inland\n* 6–10 m (20–33 ft) in Khao Lak\n* 3–6 m (9.8–19.7 ft) along the west coast of Phuket island\n* 3 m (9.8 ft) along the south coast of Phuket island\n* 2 m (6 ft 7 in) along the east coast of Phuket island\n* 4–6 m (13–20 ft) on the Phi Phi Islands\n* 19.6 m (64 ft) at Ban Thung Dap\n* 5 m (16 ft) at Ramson\n* 6.8 m (22 ft) at Ban Thale Nok\n* 5 m (16 ft) at Hat Praphat (Ranong Coastal Resources Research Station)\n* 6.3 m (21 ft) at Thai Mueang District\n* 6.8 m (22 ft) at Rai Dan\n\n\nThe province of Phang Nga was the most affected area in Thailand. The quiet resort town of Khao Lak is located on a stretch of golden sandy beach, famed for its hotels overlooking the Andaman Sea and hilly rainforests. A video, taken by a local restaurant manager from a hill adjacent to the beach, showed that the tsunami's arrival was preceded by a sudden retreat of the sea exposing the seafloor. Many tourists and locals can be seen trying to gather fish. Moments later, the tsunami arrives as a wall of foaming water that slams into the coast, washing away numerous people who had no time to escape. Another amateur video, captured by a German family at beach level, showed the tsunami appearing as a white horizontal line in the distant horizon, gradually becoming bigger (bore-like), engulfing a jet skier and lifting two police boats.[79] A maximum inundation of approximately 2 km (1.2 mi) was measured, the inundated depths were 4–7 m (13–23 ft) and there was evidence that the tsunami reached the third floor of a resort hotel. The tsunami in Khao Lak was bigger due to offshore coral reefs and shallow seafloor which caused the tsunami to pile-up. This was similar to eyewitness accounts of the tsunami at Banda Aceh.\n\n\nKhao Lak also experienced the largest tsunami run-up height outside of Sumatra.[77][*page needed*]. The highest-recorded tsunami run-up was measured 19.6 m (64 ft) at Ban Thung Dap, on the south-west tip of Ko Phra Thong Island and the second-highest at 15.8 m (52 ft) at Ban Nam Kim.[78] Moreover, the largest death toll occurred at Khao Lak, with about 5,000 people killed.\n\n\nIn addition, the tsunami inflicted damage to the popular resort town of Ao Nang in Krabi Province. Video footage showed that the tsunami appeared as multiple white surfs violently lifting up yachts, boats and crashing onto beaches. Footage captured at Koh Lanta showed a wall of water swamping the beach, while another video taken at another location showed a large surfing wave like tsunami approaching the shore, lifting up a yacht and flooding the beach. At Koh Sriboya, the tsunami advanced inland as a turbulent medium bore, while at Koh Phayam, Ranong Province, the tsunami appeared as a wall of water.\n\n\nAt Phuket Province, the island province's western beaches were struck by the tsunami. At Patong Beach, a popular tourist destination, the tsunami first arrived as a small flood, which swept away cars and surprised people. About 10 minutes later, the sea receded for a while before the tsunami arrived again as a large wall of water looming over the skyline and flooding the coast. Another video from Kamala Beach showed the tsunami flooding the ground floor of a restaurant sweeping away an elderly couple. On Karon Beach, Kamala Beach and Kata Beach, the tsunami came in like a surging flood inland carrying people and cars. On some locations, a coastal road was built which was higher than the shore, protecting a hotel which was behind it. On the east coast of Phuket Island, the tsunami height was about 2 m. In one river mouth, many boats were damaged. The tsunami moved counter-clockwise around Phuket Island, as was the case at Okushiri Island in the 1993 Hokkaido earthquake. According to interviews, the second wave was the largest.[77] The tsunami heights were 5–6 m (16–20 ft) and the inundated depth was about 2 m (6.6 ft). The tsunami surprised many tourists at Koh Racha Yai, where it flooded the resorts. About 250 people perished directly in the tsunami.\n\n\nThe Phi Phi Islands are a group of small islands that were affected by the tsunami. The north bay of Phi Phi Don Island opens to the north-west in the direction of the tsunami. The measured tsunami height on this beach was 5.8 m (19 ft). According to eyewitness accounts, the tsunami came from the north and south. The ground level was about 2 m above sea level, where there were many cottages and hotels. The south bay opens to the south-east and faces in the opposite direction from the tsunami. Furthermore, Phi Phi Le Island shields the port of Phi Phi Don Island. The measured tsunami height was 4.6 m (15 ft) in the port.[77] Amateur camcorder footage taken by Israeli tourists showed the tsunami advancing inland suddenly as a small flood, gradually becoming more powerful and engulfing the whole beach and resort, with the tsunami carrying a yacht out to sea.\n\n\nMoreover, the tsunami was detected by scuba divers around offshore islands like the Similan Islands and the Surin Islands. The divers reported being caught in a violent, swirling current suddenly while underwater. Local camcorder footage showed the tsunami surging inland and flooding camping equipment at the Similan Islands while the tsunami caught tourists unaware at the Surin Islands, and dragging them out towards the sea.\n\n\n\n### India[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tree stumps and debris remain on Karaikal beach several years after the 2004 tsunami\nThe tsunami reached the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu along the southeastern coastline of the Indian mainland about 2 hours after the earthquake. At the same time, it arrived in the state of Kerala, on the southwestern coast. There were two to five tsunamis that coincided with the local high tide in some areas.[80][81][82][83]\n\n\nThe tsunami runup height measured in mainland India by Ministry of Home Affairs includes:[83]\n\n\n\n* 3.4 m (11 ft) at Kerala, inundation distance of 0.5–1.5 km (0.31–0.93 mi) with 250 km (160 mi) of coastline affected\n* 4.5 m (15 ft) at the southern coastline of Tamil Nadu, inundation distance of 0.2–2 km (0.12–1.24 mi) with 100 km (62 mi) of coastline affected\n* 5 m (16 ft) at the eastern coastline of Tamil Nadu facing tsunami source, inundation distance of 0.4–1.5 km (0.25–0.93 mi) with 800 km (500 mi) of coastline affected\n* 4 m (13 ft) at Pondicherry, inundation distance of 0.2–2 km (0.12–1.24 mi) with 25 km (16 mi) of coastline affected\n* 2.2 m (7.2 ft) at Andhra Pradesh, inundation distance of 0.2–1 km (0.12–0.62 mi) with 985 km (612 mi) of coastline affected\n\n\nAlong the coast of Tamil Nadu, the 13 km (8.1 mi) Marina Beach in Chennai was battered by the tsunami which swept across the beach taking morning walkers unaware. Amateur video recorded taken at a resort beach showed the tsunami arriving as a large wall of water as it approached the coast and flooding it as it advanced inland. Besides that, a 10 m (33 ft) black muddy tsunami ravaged the city of Karaikal, where 492 people died. The city of Pondicherry, protected by seawalls was relatively unscathed. Local video recorded that before the arrival of the tsunami, people can be seen swarming the beach to check on stranded fish from the exposed beach. Furthermore, at the coastal town of Kanyakumari, the seabed was exposed briefly before a large wall of water can be seen on the horizon and subsequently flooding the town. Other footage showed the tsunami dramatically crashed into the Vivekananda Rock Memorial.[83] The worst affected area in Tamil Nadu was Nagapattinam district, with 6,051 fatalities caused by a 5 m (16 ft) tsunami, followed by Cuddalore district, with many villages destroyed.[83] Most of the people killed were members of the fishing community.[83] Velankanni a sea shore town with a Catholic Basilica and a popular pilgrimage destination was also one of the worst hit by this tsunami that struck at around 9.30 am on that Sunday, when pilgrims who were mostly from Kerala among others were inside the church attending the Malayalam Mass. The rising sea water did not enter the shrine, but the receding waters swept away hundreds of pilgrims who were on the beach.[84] The shrine's compound, nearby villages, hundreds of shops, homes and pilgrims were washed away into the sea. About 600 pilgrims died.[85] Rescue teams extricated more than 400 bodies from the sand and rocks in the vicinity and large number of unidentified bodies were buried in mass graves.\n\n\nThe state of Kerala experienced tsunami-related damage in three southern densely populated districts, Ernakulam, Alappuzha, and Kollam, due to diffraction of the waves around Sri Lanka. The southernmost district of Thiruvananthapuram, however, escaped damage, possibly due to the wide turn of the diffracted waves at the peninsular tip. Major damage occurred in two narrow strips of land bound on the west by the Arabian Sea and on the east by the Kerala backwaters. The waves receded before the first tsunami with the highest fatality reported from the densely populated Alappad panchayat (including the villages of Cheriya Azhikkal and Azhikkal) at Kollam district, caused by a 4 m (13 ft) tsunami.[83] A video recorded by locals showed the tsunami flooding the beach and villages, causing despair amongst the villagers.\n\n\n\n![](image)A car deposited on top of a fence and various pieces of debris in Chennai\nMany villages in the state of Andhra Pradesh were destroyed. In the Krishna district, the tsunami created havoc in Manginapudi and on Machalipattanam Beach. The most affected was Prakasham District, recording 35 deaths, with maximum damage at Singraikonda.[83] Given the enormous power of the tsunami, the fishing industry suffered the greatest. Moreover, the cost of damage in the transport sector was reported in the tens of thousands.[83]\n\n\nThe tsunami run-up was only 1.6 m (5.2 ft) in areas in the state of Tamil Nadu shielded by the island of Sri Lanka but was 4–5 m (13–16 ft) in coastal districts such as Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu directly across from Sumatra. On the western coast, the runup elevations were 4.5 m (15 ft) at Kanyakumari District in Tamil Nadu and 3.4 m (11 ft) each at Kollam and Ernakulam districts in Kerala. The time between the waves ranged from about 15 minutes to 90 minutes.[80][82][86] The tsunami varied in height from 2 m (6.6 ft) to 10 m (33 ft) based on survivors' accounts.[83] The tsunami travelled 2.5 km (1.6 mi) at its maximum inland at Karaikal, Puducherry.[83] The inundation distance varied between 1,006–500 m (3,301–1,640 ft) in most areas, except at river mouths, where it was more than 1 km (0.62 mi). Areas with dense coconut groves or mangroves had much smaller inundation distances, and those with river mouths or backwaters saw larger inundation distances.[*citation needed*] Presence of seawalls at the Kerala and Tamil Nadu coasts reduced the impact of the waves. However, when the seawalls were made of loose stones, the stones were displaced and carried a few metres inland.[80][82][86]\n\n\n\n#### Andaman and Nicobar Islands[edit]\n\n\nDue to close proximity to the earthquake, the tsunami took just minutes to devastate the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Andaman Islands were moderately affected while the island of Little Andaman and the Nicobar Islands were severely affected by the tsunami.\n\n\nIn South Andaman island, based on local eyewitnesses, there were three tsunami waves, with the third being the most destructive. Flooding occurred at the coast and low-lying areas inland, which were connected to open sea through creeks. Inundation was observed, along the east coast of South Andaman Island, restricted to Chidiyatapu, Burmanallah, Kodiaghat, Beadnabad, Corbyn's cove and Marina Park/Aberdeen Jetty areas. Along the west coast, the inundation was observed around Guptapara, Manjeri, Wandoor, Collinpur and Tirur regions. Several near-shore establishments and numerous infrastructures such as seawalls and a 20 MW diesel-generated power plant at Bamboo Flat were destroyed.[87] At Port Blair, the water receded before the first wave, and the third wave was the tallest and caused the most damage.\n\n\nResults of the tsunami survey in South Andaman along Chiriyatapu, Corbyn's Cove and Wandoor beaches:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* 5 m (16 ft) in maximum tsunami height with a run-up of 4.24 m (13.9 ft) at Chiriyatapu Beach\n* 5.5 m (18 ft) in maximum tsunami height and run-up at Corbyn's Cove Beach\n* 6.6 m (22 ft) in maximum tsunami height and run-up of 4.63 m (15.2 ft) at Wandoor Beach\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the Little Andaman, tsunami waves impinged on the eastern shore about 25 to 30 minutes after the earthquake in a four-wave cycle of which the fourth tsunami was the most devastating with a wave height of about 10 m (33 ft). The tsunami destroyed settlements at Hut Bay within a range of 1 km (0.62 mi) from the seashore. Run up level up to 3.8 m (12 ft) have been measured.[87]\n\n\nIn Malacca, located on the island of Car Nicobar, there were three tsunami waves. The sea was observed to rise suddenly before the onset of the first wave. The first wave came 5 minutes after the earthquake, preceded by a recession of the sea up to 600–700 m (2,000–2,300 ft).[*citation needed*]. The second and third waves came in 10 minutes intervals after the first wave. The third wave was the strongest, with a maximum tsunami wave height of 11 m (36 ft). Waves nearly three stories high devastated the Indian Air Force base, located just south of Malacca. The maximum tsunami wave height of 11 m (36 ft).[*citation needed*] Inundation limit was found to be up to 1.25 km (0.78 mi) inland. The impact of the waves was so severe that four oil tankers were thrown almost 800 m (2,600 ft) from the seashore near Malacca to the Air force colony main gate.[87] In Chuckchucha and Lapati, the tsunami arrived in a three-wave cycle with a maximum tsunami wave height of 12 m (39 ft).\n\n\nIn Campbell Bay of Great Nicobar Island, the tsunami waves hit the area three times with an inundation limit of 250–500 m (820–1,640 ft). A rise in sea level was observed before the first wave came within 5 minutes of the earthquake. The second and third waves came in 10-minute intervals after the first. The second wave was the strongest. The tsunami waves wreaked havoc in the densely populated Jogindar Nagar area, situated 13 km (8.1 mi) south of Campbell Bay.[*citation needed*] According to local accounts,[*attribution needed*] tsunami waves attacked the area three times. The first wave came five minutes after the mainshock (0629 hrs.) with a marginal drop in sea level. The second wave came 10 minutes after the first one with a maximum height of 4.8 m (16 ft) to 8 m (26 ft) and caused the major destruction. The third wave came within 15 minutes after the second with lower wave height. The maximum inundation limit due to tsunami water was about 500 m (1,600 ft).[87]\n\n\nThe worst affected island in the Andaman & Nicobar chain is Katchall Island, with 303 people confirmed dead and 4,354 missing out of a total population of 5,312.[88][89][90] The significant shielding of Port Blair and Campbell Bay by steep mountainous outcrops contributed to the relatively low wave heights at these locations, whereas the open terrain along the eastern coast at Malacca and Hut Bay contributed to the great height of the tsunami waves.[89][91]\n\n\nReports of tsunami wave height:[92][93]\n\n\n\n* 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) at Diglipur and Rangat at North Andaman Island\n* 8 m (26 ft) high at Campbell Bay on Great Nicobar Island\n* 10–12 m (33–39 ft) high at Malacca (in Car Nicobar Island) and at Hut Bay on Little Andaman Island\n* 3 m (9.8 ft) high at Port Blair on South Andaman Island\n\n\n### Maldives[edit]\n\n\nThe tsunami severely affected the Maldives at a distance of 2,500 km (1,600 mi) from the epicentre. Similar to Sri Lanka, survivors reported three waves with the second wave being the most powerful. Being rich in coral reefs, the Maldives provides an opportunity for scientists to assess the impact of a tsunami on coral atolls. The significantly lower tsunami impact on the Maldives compared to Sri Lanka is mostly due to the topography and bathymetry of the atoll chain with offshore coral reefs, deep channels separating individual atolls and its arrival within low tide which decreased the power of the tsunami. After the tsunami, there was some concern that the country might be submerged entirely and become uninhabitable. However, this was proven untrue.\nThe highest tsunami wave measured was 4 m (13 ft) at Vilufushi Island. The tsunami arrived approximately 2 hours after the earthquake. The greatest tsunami inundation occurred at North Male Atoll, Male island at 250 m (820 ft) along the streets.\n\n\nLocal footage recorded showed the tsunami flooding the streets up to knee level in town, while another video taken at the beach showed the tsunami slowly flooding and gradually surging inland.\n\n\nThe Maldives tsunami wave analysis:\n\n\n\n* 1.3–2.4 m (4 ft 3 in – 7 ft 10 in) at North Male Atoll, Male Island\n* 2 m (6 ft 7 in) at North Male Atoll, Huhule Island\n* 1.7–2.8 m (5 ft 7 in – 9 ft 2 in) at South Male Atoll, Embudhu Finothu\n* 2.5–3.3 m (8 ft 2 in – 10 ft 10 in) at Laamu Atoll, Fonadhoo Island\n* 2.2–2.9 m (7 ft 3 in – 9 ft 6 in) at Laamu Atoll, Gan Island\n* 2.3–3 m (7 ft 7 in – 9 ft 10 in) at North Male Atoll, Dhiffushi Island\n* 2.2–2.4 m (7 ft 3 in – 7 ft 10 in) at North Male Atoll, Huraa Island\n* more than 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) at North Male Atoll, Kuda Huraa Island\n\n\n### Myanmar[edit]\n\n\nIn Myanmar, the tsunami caused only moderate damage, which arrived between 2 and 5.5 hours after the earthquake. Although the country's western Andaman Sea coastline lies at the proximity of the rupture zone, there were smaller tsunamis than the neighbouring Thai coast, because the main tsunami source did not extend to the Andaman Islands. Another factor is that some coasts of Taninthayi Division were protected by the Myeik Archipelago. Based on scientific surveys from Ayeyarwady Delta through Taninthayi Division, it was revealed that tsunami heights along the Myanmar coast were between 0.4–2.9 m (1 ft 4 in – 9 ft 6 in). Eyewitnesses compared the tsunami with the \"rainy-season high tide\"; although at most locations, the tsunami height was similar or smaller than the \"rainy-season high tide\" level.[94]\n\n\nTsunami survey heights:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* 0.6–2.3 m (2 ft 0 in – 7 ft 7 in) around the Ayeyarwady delta\n* 0.9–2.9 m (2 ft 11 in – 9 ft 6 in) at Dawei area\n* 0.7–2.2 m (2 ft 4 in – 7 ft 3 in) around Myeik\n* 0.4–2.6 m (1 ft 4 in – 8 ft 6 in) around Kawthaung\n\n\nInterviews with local people indicate that they did not feel the earthquake in Taninthayi Division or Ayeyarwady Delta. The 71 casualties can be attributed to poor housing infrastructure and additionally, the fact that the coastal residents in the surveyed areas live on flat land along the coast, especially in the Ayeyarwady Delta, and that there is no higher ground to which to evacuate. The tsunami heights from the 2004 December earthquake were not more than 3 m (9.8 ft) along the Myanmar coast, the amplitudes were slightly large off the Ayeyarwady Delta, probably because the shallow delta caused a concentration in tsunami energy.[94]\n\n\n\n### Somalia[edit]\n\n\nThe tsunami travelled 5,000 km (3,100 mi) west across the open ocean before striking the East African country of Somalia. Around 289 fatalities were reported in the Horn of Africa, drowned by four tsunami waves. The hardest-hit was a 650 km (400 mi) stretch of the Somalia coastline between Garacad (Mudug region) and Xaafuun (Bari region), which forms part of the Puntland province. Most of the victims were reported along the low-lying Xaafuun Peninsula.[95] The Puntland coast in northern Somalia was by far the area hardest hit by the waves to the west of the Indian subcontinent. The waves arrived around noon local time.[95]\n\n\nConsequently, tsunami runup heights vary from 5 m (16 ft) to 9 m (30 ft) with inundation distances varying from 44 m (144 ft) to 704 m (2,310 ft). The maximum runup height of almost 9 m (30 ft) was recorded in Bandarbeyla. An even higher runup point was measured on a cliff near the town of Eyl, solely on an eyewitness account.\n\n\nThe highest death toll was in Hafun, with 19 dead and 160 people presumed missing out of its 5,000 inhabitants. This was the highest number of casualties in a single African town and the largest tsunami death toll in a single town to the west of the Indian subcontinent. In Xaafuun, small drawbacks were observed before the third and most powerful tsunami wave flooded the town.[95]\n\n\n\n### Other locations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Flooding in George Town, Malaysia\nThe tsunami also reached Malaysia, mainly on the northern states such as Kedah, Perak and Penang and on offshore islands such as Langkawi island. Peninsular Malaysia was shielded by the full force of the tsunami due to the protection offered by the island of Sumatra, which lies just off the western coast.[96]\n\n\nBangladesh escaped major damage and deaths because the water displaced by the strike-slip fault was relatively little on the northern section of the rupture zone, which ruptured slowly. In Yemen, the tsunami killed two people with a maximum runup of 2 m (6.6 ft).[97]\n\n\nThe tsunami was detected in the southern parts of east Africa, where rough seas were reported, specifically on the eastern and southern coasts that face the Indian Ocean. A few other African countries also recorded fatalities; one in Kenya, three in Seychelles, ten in Tanzania, and South Africa, where two were killed as a direct result of the tsunami—the furthest from the epicentre.[98][99]\n\n\nTidal surges also occurred along the Western Australian coast that lasted for several hours, resulting in boats losing their moorings and two people needing to be rescued.[100]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n### Countries affected[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Countries affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami\n\n![](image)Countries affected\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, a total of 227,898 people died.[1] Measured in lives lost, this is one of the ten worst earthquakes in recorded history, as well as the single worst tsunami in history. Indonesia was the worst affected area, with most death toll estimates at around 170,000.[101] An initial report by Siti Fadilah Supari, the Indonesian Minister of Health at the time, estimated the death total to be as high as 220,000 in Indonesia alone, giving a total of 280,000 fatalities.[102] However, the estimated number of dead and missing in Indonesia were later reduced by over 50,000. In their report, the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition stated, \"It should be remembered that all such data are subject to error, as data on missing persons especially are not always as good as one might wish\".[6] A much higher number of deaths has been suggested for Myanmar based on reports from Thailand.[103]\n\n\nThe tsunami caused severe damage and deaths as far as the east coast of Africa, with the furthest recorded fatality directly attributed to the tsunami at Rooi-Els, close to Cape Town, 8,000 km (5,000 mi) from the epicentre.[104]\n\n\nRelief agencies reported that one third of the dead appeared to be children. This was a result of the high proportion of children in the populations of many of the affected regions and because children were the least able to resist being overcome by the surging waters. Oxfam went on to report that as many as four times more women than men were killed in some regions because they were waiting on the beach for the fishers to return and looking after their children in the houses.[105]\n\n\nStates of emergency were declared in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Maldives. The United Nations estimated at the outset that the relief operation would be the costliest in human history.[*citation needed*] Then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated that reconstruction would probably take between five and ten years. Governments and non-governmental organizations feared that the final death toll might double as a result of diseases, prompting a massive humanitarian response.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn addition to a large number of local residents, up to 9,000 foreign tourists (mostly Europeans) enjoying the peak holiday travel season were among the dead or missing, especially people from the Nordic countries.[106] Sweden was the European country most severely affected both in absolute numbers, and by a wide margin when considered in relation to the country's population, with a death toll of 543. Germany was close behind with 539 identified victims.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Affected country[a] | Confirmed deaths\n | Estimated deaths[b] | Injured\n | Missing\n | Displaced\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Indonesia | 130,736 | 167,540 |  | 37,063 | 500,000+\n | [107] |\n| ![](image) Sri Lanka | 35,322[c] | 35,322 | 21,411 |  | 516,150 | [108] |\n| ![](image) India | 12,405 | 16,269 |  | 3,874 | 647,599 |  |\n| ![](image) Thailand | 5,395[d] | 8,212 | 8,457 | 2,817 | 7,000 | [109][110] |\n| ![](image) Somalia | 78 | 289 |  |  | 5,000 | [111][112] |\n| ![](image) Myanmar | 61 | 400–600\n | 45 | 200 | 3,200 | [103][113] |\n| ![](image) Maldives | 82 | 108 |  | 26 | 15,000+\n | [114][115] |\n| ![](image) Malaysia | 68 | 75 | 299 | 6 | 5,000+\n | [116][117] |\n| ![](image) Tanzania | 10 | 13 |  | 3 |  | [118] |\n| ![](image) Seychelles | 3 | 3 | 57 |  | 200 | [119][120] |\n| ![](image) Bangladesh | 2 | 2 |  |  |  | [121] |\n| ![](image) South Africa | 2[e] | 2 |  |  |  | [122] |\n| ![](image) Yemen | 2 | 2 |  |  |  | [123] |\n| ![](image) Kenya | 1 | 1 | 2 |  |  |  |\n| ![](image) Madagascar |  |  |  |  | 1,000+\n | [124] |\n| **Total estimates** | **184,167** | **227,898** | **125,000** | **43,789** | **1,740,000** |  |\n| * **^a** This table refers only to countries directly affected by the tsunami, not to countries whose citizens were affected while overseas.\n* **^b** Includes those reported under 'Confirmed'.

Severe damage was inflicted on ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, forests, coastal wetlands, vegetation, sand dunes and rock formations, animal and plant biodiversity and groundwater. Also, the spread of solid and liquid waste and industrial chemicals, water pollution and the destruction of sewage collectors and treatment plants threatened the environment even further, in untold ways. The environmental impact took a long time and significant resources to assess.[125]\n\n\nThe main effect was caused by poisoning of the freshwater supplies and of the soil by saltwater infiltration and a deposit of a salt layer over arable land. In the Maldives, 16 to 17 coral reef atolls that were overcome by sea waves are without fresh water and could be rendered uninhabitable for decades. Uncountable wells that served communities were invaded by sea, sand, and earth; and aquifers were invaded through porous rock. On the island's east coast, the tsunami contaminated wells on which many villagers relied for drinking water.[126]\n\n\nThe Colombo-based International Water Management Institute monitored the effects of saltwater and concluded that the wells recovered to pre-tsunami drinking water quality one-and-a-half years after the event.[126] \nThe IWMI developed protocols for cleaning wells contaminated by saltwater; these were subsequently officially endorsed by the World Health Organization as part of its series of Emergency Guidelines.[127]\n\n\nSalted-over soil becomes sterile, and it is difficult and costly to restore for agriculture. It also causes the death of plants and important soil micro-organisms. Thousands of rice, mango, and banana plantations in Sri Lanka were destroyed almost entirely and will take years to recover.[126]\n\n\nIn addition to other forms of aid,[128] the Australian government sent ecological experts to help develop strategies for reef-monitoring and rehabilitation of marine environments and coral reefs in the Maldives, Seychelles and other areas. Scientists had developed significant ecological expertise from work with the Great Barrier Reef, in Australia's northeastern waters.[129]\n\n\nIn response to the unprecedented situation, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) worked with governments in the region to determine the severity of the ecological impact and how to address it.[130] UNEP established an emergency fund, set up a Task Force to respond to requests for assistance from countries affected by the tsunami, and was able to mobilize and distribute approximately US$9.3 million for environmental recovery and disaster risk reduction between 2004 and 2007. Funding came from other international agencies and from countries including Finland, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.[131][132]\n\n\nEvidence suggested that the presence of mangroves in coastal areas had provided some protection, when compared to areas that had been cleared for aquaculture or development. As a result, mangrove restoration become a focus of a number of projects, with varied success. Such approaches to ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction appear to be most successful when local communities are closely involved as stakeholders throughout the process, and when careful attention is paid to the physical conditions of chosen sites to ensure that mangroves can thrive there.[133]\n\n\n\n### Economic impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chennai's Marina Beach after the tsunami\nThe level of damage to the economy resulting from the tsunami depends on the scale examined. While the overall impact on the national economies was minor, local economies were devastated. The two main occupations affected by the tsunami were fishing and tourism.[134] \nSome economists believe that damage to the affected national economies will be minor because losses in the tourism and fishing industries are a relatively small percentage of the GDP. However, others caution that damage to infrastructure is an overriding factor. In some areas drinking water supplies and farm fields may have been contaminated for years by saltwater from the ocean.[135]\n\n\nThe impact on coastal fishing communities and the people living there, some of the poorest in the region, has been devastating with high losses of income earners as well as boats and fishing gear.[136][137] In Sri Lanka, artisanal fishery, in which the use of fish baskets, fishing traps, and spears are commonly used, is an important source of fish for local markets; industrial fishery is the major economic activity, providing direct employment to about 250,000 people. In recent years the fishery industry has emerged as a dynamic export-oriented sector, generating substantial foreign exchange earnings. Preliminary estimates indicated that 66% of the fishing fleet and industrial infrastructure in coastal regions were destroyed by the wave surges.[138]\n\n\nWhile the tsunami destroyed many of the boats vital to Sri Lanka's fishing industry, it also created a demand for fibreglass-reinforced plastic catamarans in the boatyards of Tamil Nadu. Given that over 51,000 vessels were lost to the tsunami, the industry boomed. However, the huge demand has led to lower quality in the process, and some important materials were sacrificed to cut prices for those who were impoverished by the tsunami.[139]\n\n\nEven though only coastal regions were directly affected by the waters of the tsunami, the indirect effects have spread to inland provinces as well. Since the media coverage of the event was so extensive, many tourists cancelled vacations and trips to that part of the world, even though their travel destinations may not have been affected. This ripple effect could especially be felt in the inland provinces of Thailand, such as Krabi, which acted as a starting point for many other tourist destinations in Thailand.[140]\n\n\nCountries in the region appealed to tourists to return, pointing out that most tourist infrastructure is undamaged. However, tourists were reluctant to do so for psychological reasons. Even beach resorts in parts of Thailand which were untouched by the tsunami were hit by cancellations.[141]\n\n\nBoth the earthquake and the tsunami may have affected shipping in the Malacca Straits, which separate Malaysia and the Indonesian island of Sumatra, by changing the depth of the seabed and by disturbing navigational buoys and old shipwrecks. In one area of the Strait, water depths were previously up to 1,200 m (4,000 ft), and are now only 30 m (100 ft) in some areas, making shipping impossible and dangerous. These problems also made the delivery of relief aid more challenging. Compiling new navigational charts may take months or years. Officials also hoped that piracy in the region would drop off, since the tsunami had killed pirates and destroyed their boats.[142] Due to multiple factors, there was a 71.6% drop in the number of piracy incidents between 2004 and 2005, from 60 to 17 incidents. Levels remained relatively low for some years. However, between 2013 and 2014, piracy incidents rose dramatically by 73.2% to exceed pre-tsunami levels.[143]\n\n\n\n### Historical context[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Library damage resulting from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake\n\n![Earthquakes in Sumatra](image)![2004](image)\n2004\n![1833](image)\n1833\n![2005](image)\n2005\n![1861](image)\n1861\n![2007](image)\n2007\n![1797](image)\n1797\nclass=notpageimage|\nOf the ten strongest Indonesian earthquakes ≥ 8.3 Mw, six occurred near Sumatra\n\nThe last major tsunami in the Indian Ocean was about A.D. 1400.[144][145] In 2008, a team of scientists working on Phra Thong, a barrier island along the hard-hit west coast of Thailand, reported evidence of at least three previous major tsunamis in the preceding 2,800 years, the most recent from about 700 years ago. A second team found similar evidence of previous tsunamis in Aceh, a province at the northern tip of Sumatra; radiocarbon dating of bark fragments in the soil below the second sand layer led the scientists to estimate that the most recent predecessor to the 2004 tsunami probably occurred between A.D. 1300 and 1450.[146]\n\n\nThe 2004 earthquake and tsunami combined is the world's deadliest natural disaster since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake. The earthquake was the third-most-powerful earthquake recorded since 1900. The deadliest-known earthquake in history occurred in 1556 in Shaanxi, China, with an estimated death toll of 830,000, though figures from this period may not be as reliable.[147]\n\n\nBefore 2004, the tsunami created in both Indian and Pacific Ocean waters by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, thought to have resulted in anywhere from 36,000 to 120,000 deaths, had probably been the deadliest in the region. In 1782, about 40,000 people are thought to have been killed by a tsunami (or a cyclone) in the South China Sea.[148] The deadliest tsunami before 2004 was Italy's 1908 Messina earthquake on the Mediterranean Sea where the earthquake and tsunami killed about 123,000.[149]\n\n\n\n### Other effects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsunami aftermath in Aceh, Indonesia\nMany health professionals and aid workers have reported widespread psychological trauma associated with the tsunami.[150] Even 14 years afterwards, researchers find HPA axis dysregulation and “burnout” in survivors.[151] Traditional beliefs in many of the affected regions state that a relative of the family must bury the body of the dead, and in many cases, no body remained to be buried. Women in Aceh required a special approach from foreign aid agencies, and continue to have unique needs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe hardest-hit area, Aceh, is a religiously conservative Islamic society and has had no tourism nor any Western presence in recent years due to the insurgency between the Indonesian military and Free Aceh Movement (GAM). Some believe that the tsunami was divine punishment for lay Muslims shirking their daily prayers or following a materialistic lifestyle. Others have said that Allah was angry that Muslims were killing each other in an ongoing conflict.[152] Saudi cleric Muhammad Al-Munajjid attributed it to divine retribution against non-Muslim vacationers \"who used to sprawl all over the beaches and in pubs overflowing with wine\" during Christmas break.[153]\n\n\nThe widespread devastation caused by the tsunami led GAM to declare a cease-fire on 28 December 2004 followed by the Indonesian government, and the two groups resumed long-stalled peace talks, which resulted in a peace agreement signed 15 August 2005. The agreement explicitly cites the tsunami as a justification.[154]\n\n\nIn a poll conducted in 27 countries, 15% of respondents named the tsunami the most significant event of the year. Only the Iraq War was named by as many respondents.[155][156] The extensive international media coverage of the tsunami, and the role of mass media and journalists in reconstruction, were discussed by editors of newspapers and broadcast media in tsunami-affected areas, in special video-conferences set up by the Asia Pacific Journalism Centre.[157]\n\n\nThe tsunami left both the people and government of India in a state of heightened alert. On 30 December 2004, four days after the tsunami, Terra Research notified the India government that its sensors indicated there was a possibility of 7.9 to 8.1 magnitude tectonic shift in the next 12 hours between Sumatra and New Zealand.[158] In response, the Indian Minister of Home Affairs announced that a fresh onslaught of deadly tsunami was likely along the southern Indian coast and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, even as there was no sign of turbulence in the region.[158] The announcement generated panic in the Indian Ocean region and caused thousands to flee their homes, which resulted in jammed roads.[159] The announcement was a false alarm, and the Home Affairs minister withdrew their announcement.[159] On further investigation, the India government learned that the consulting company Terra Research was run from the home of a self-described earthquake forecaster who had no telephone listing and maintained a website where he sold copies of his detection system.[160]\n\n\n\n![](image)Patong Beach in Thailand after the tsunami\nThe tsunami had a severe humanitarian and political impact in Sweden. The hardest-hit country outside Asia, Sweden, lost 543 tourists, mainly in Thailand. The Persson Cabinet was heavily criticized for its inaction.[161]\n\n\nSmith Dharmasaroja, a meteorologist who had predicted that an earthquake and tsunami \"is going to occur for sure\" way back in 1994,[162][163] was assigned the development of the Thai tsunami warning system. The Indian Ocean Tsunami warning system was formed in early 2005 to provide an early warning of tsunamis for inhabitants around the Indian Ocean coasts.[164]\n\n\n\nThe changes in the distribution of masses inside the Earth due to the earthquake had several consequences. It displaced the North Pole by 25 mm (0.98 in). It also slightly changed the shape of the Earth, specifically by decreasing Earth's oblateness by about one part in 10 billion, consequentially increasing Earth's rotation a little and thus shortening the length of the day by 2.68 microseconds.[165]\n\n\n## Humanitarian response[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake\n\n![](image)German tsunami relief mission visiting Mullaitivu in Sri Lanka's Northern Province\nA great deal of humanitarian aid was needed because of widespread damage to the infrastructure, shortages of food and water, and economic damage. Epidemics were of particular concern due to the high population density and tropical climate of the affected areas. The main concern of humanitarian and government agencies was to provide sanitation facilities and fresh drinking water to contain the spread of diseases such as cholera, diphtheria, dysentery, typhoid and hepatitis A and hepatitis B.\n\n\nThere was also a great concern that the death toll could increase as disease and hunger spread. However, because of the initial quick response, this was minimized.[166]\n\n\nIn the days following the tsunami, significant effort was spent in burying bodies hurriedly due to fear of disease spreading. However, the public health risks may have been exaggerated, and therefore this may not have been the best way to allocate resources.[167][168] The World Food Programme provided food aid to more than 1.3 million people affected by the tsunami.[169]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Health risks from dead bodies\n\nNations all over the world provided over US$14 billion in aid for damaged regions,[170] with the governments of Australia pledging US$819.9 million (including a US$760.6 million aid package for Indonesia), Germany offering US$660 million, Japan offering US$500 million, Canada offering US$343 million, Norway and the Netherlands offering both US$183 million, the United States offering US$35 million initially (increased to US$350 million), and the World Bank offering US$250 million. Also, Italy offered US$95 million, increased later to US$113 million of which US$42 million was donated by the population using the SMS system.[171] Australia, India, Japan and the United States formed an ad-hoc corroborative group, and it was the origin of Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.[172]\n\n\n\n![](image)Memorial dedicated to victims of the tsunami, Batticaloa, in Sri Lanka\nAccording to USAID, the US has pledged additional funds in long-term U.S. support to help the tsunami victims rebuild their lives. On 9 February 2005, President Bush asked Congress to increase the U.S. commitment to a total of US$950 million. Officials estimated that billions of dollars would be needed. Bush also asked his father, former President George H. W. Bush, and former President Bill Clinton to lead a U.S. effort to provide private aid to the tsunami victims.[173]\n\n\nIn mid-March, the Asian Development Bank reported that over US$4 billion in aid promised by governments was behind schedule. Sri Lanka reported that it had received no foreign government aid, while foreign individuals had been generous.[174] Many charities were given considerable donations from the public. For example, in the United Kingdom, the public donated roughly £330 million sterling (nearly US$600 million). This considerably outweighed the allocation by the government to disaster relief and reconstruction of £75 million and came to an average of about £5.50 (US$10) donated by every citizen.[175][176]\n\n\nIn August 2006, fifteen local aid staff working on post-tsunami rebuilding were found executed in north-east Sri Lanka after heavy fighting between government troops and the Tamil Tiger rebels, the main umbrella body for aid agencies in the country said.[177]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n### Film and television[edit]\n\n\n* *Children of Tsunami: No More Tears* (2005), a 24-minute documentary\n* *The Wave That Shook The World* (2005), educational television-series documentary about the tsunami\n* *Tsunami: The Aftermath* (2006), a two-part television miniseries about its aftermath\n* *Dasavathaaram* (2008), a Tamil thriller film involving the tsunami\n* *Hereafter* (2010), a main character's life is affected after surviving the tsunami while on vacation\n* *Hafalan Shalat Delisa* (2011), an Indonesian movie with the tsunami as the initial incident\n* *The Impossible* (2012), an English-language Spanish film based on the story of María Belón and her family\n* *Kayal* (2014), a Tamil drama film which culminates with the tsunami\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\n* *Paint the Sky with Stars: Selected Poetry in Remembrance of the Boxing Day Tsunami 2004* (2005) edited by Stephen Robert Kuta[178]\n* *The Killing Sea* (2006), two teenagers struggle to survive in the days after the tsunami[179]\n* *Wave* (2013), a memoir by Sonali Deraniyagala\n* *On the Island* (2012), two people stranded on a Maldives uninhabited island are rescued because of the tsunami.\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n* \"12/26\" by Kimya Dawson, about the event and the humanitarian efforts, from the perspective of a victim whose family died in the disaster.\n* \"Where the Wave Broke\" by Burst, written in memory of Mieszko Talarczyk, frontman of Swedish grindcore band Nasum (whom Burst bassist Jesper Liveröd also performed with), who died in the disaster, which led to Nasum's subsequent disbandment.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nScholia has a *topic* profile for ***2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami***.\n\n* Deaths in December 2004 – notable people killed in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami\n* List of earthquakes in 2004\n* List of earthquakes in Indonesia\n* List of natural disasters by death toll\n* Lists of earthquakes\n* List of megathrust earthquakes\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** National Earthquake Information Center (26 December 2004). \"M 9.1 - 2004 Sumatra - Andaman Islands Earthquake\".
