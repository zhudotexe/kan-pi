At age seven, he began modeling and taking piano lessons in his hometown.[8][9] In elementary school, he appeared in *The Sound of Music* and played the title character in *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz*. He also served as a choirboy in a production of *See How They Run*. His parents sold their delicatessen in 1989 and the family, without his father, moved to Los Angeles in order for Wood to pursue an acting career. His parents divorced when he was 15.[10]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1988\u20131998: Early work[edit]\n\n\nWood modeled and appeared in local commercials. He got his first break in the music video for Paula Abdul's \"Forever Your Girl,\" directed by David Fincher. This was followed by a pivotal role in the made-for-TV film, *Child in the Night,* and a minor role in *Back to the Future Part II*, as a boy from a futuristic 2015 who teases Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) for playing an arcade game because \"you have to use your hands\".[11] Nine-year-old Wood auditioned for a role in *Kindergarten Cop*, but was told by director Ivan Reitman that his performance was not believable, which Wood later said was \"a harsh thing to say to a nine-year-old.\"[12]\n\n\nPlaying Aidan Quinn's son in *Avalon* garnered professional attention for Wood; the film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for four Academy Awards.[13] A small part in Richard Gere's *Internal Affairs* was followed by the role of a boy who brings estranged couple Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson back together in *Paradise* (1991). In 1992, Wood co-starred with Mel Gibson and Jamie Lee Curtis in *Forever Young*,[14] and with Joseph Mazzello in *Radio Flyer*.[15]\n\n\nIn 1993, Wood played the title character in Disney's adaptation of Mark Twain's novel, *The Adventures of Huck Finn*, and co-starred with Macaulay Culkin in the psychological thriller *The Good Son*. The following year, he starred in *The War*, alongside Kevin Costner. Roger Ebert's review of the film praised Wood highly, stating that Wood \"has emerged, I believe, as the most talented actor, in his age group, in Hollywood history.\"[16]\n\n\nWood's title role\u2013opposite Bruce Willis\u2013in the Robert Reiner film *North* (1994) was followed by a Super Bowl commercial for Lay's \"Wavy\" potato chips (with Dan Quayle).[17] In 1995, Wood appeared in the music video for The Cranberries' \"Ridiculous Thoughts,\"[18] played the lead role in *Flipper*, and co-starred in Ang Lee's critically acclaimed *The Ice Storm*.[19] In 1997, Wood played Jack \"The Artful Dodger\" Dawkins in a made-for-TV adaptation of *Oliver Twist*, alongside Richard Dreyfuss.[20] The following year, he had a leading role in the sci-fi disaster film *Deep Impact,* and a starring role in *The Faculty*, directed by Robert Rodriguez. In 1999, Wood played a suburban white teenager who affects hip-hop lingo in James Toback's *Black and White*, and a junior hitman in *Chain of Fools*.[21]\n\n\n\n### 1999\u20132003: *The Lord of the Rings*[edit]\n\n\nWood played Frodo Baggins in the 2001 *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, the first installment of Peter Jackson's adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's multi-volume novel. Wood was a fan of the book series, and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel.[22] He was selected from 150 actors who auditioned.[23] Wood was the first actor to be cast.[24] This gave Wood top billing, alongside a cast that included Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Orlando Bloom, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Miranda Otto, Sean Bean, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, and John Rhys-Davies.[25][26][27] \nThe *Lord of the Rings* trilogy was filmed in New Zealand, in a process taking more than one year for principal photography alone, with pick-up shots annually for the next four years.[28][29]\nBefore the cast left the country, Jackson gave Wood two gifts: one of the One Ring props used on the set and Sting, Frodo's sword. He was also given a pair of prosthetic \"hobbit feet\" of the type worn during filming.[30]\n\n\nIn 2002, Wood lent his voice to the DTV release of *The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina*. Later that year, the second part of Peter Jackson's trilogy was released, titled *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*, in which Wood had a reduced role from the first movie. \nIn 2003, Wood starred in the DTV film *All I Want* and also cameoed as 'The Guy' in *Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over*.

In a 2012 interview, he denied that he ever said he was retiring, only that he didn't have \"plans to do another movie\" at the time and that he was \"taking a little break now. I don't have anything lined up.\"[34] In 2009 he joined the cast of *The Road*, a film adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name,[35] and collaborated with David Cronenberg for a third time on *A Dangerous Method*.[36]\n\n\n\n### 2010s\u2013present: Critical acclaim[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2009: Ian McKellen\n |\n| 2010s | * 2010: Julia Roberts\n* 2011: Glenn Close\n* 2012: Oliver Stone / Ewan McGregor / Tommy Lee Jones / John Travolta / Dustin Hoffman\n* 2013: Carmen Maura / Hugh Jackman\n* 2014: Denzel Washington / Benicio del Toro\n* 2015: Emily Watson\n* 2016: Sigourney Weaver / Ethan Hawke\n* 2017: Ricardo Dar\u00edn / Monica Bellucci / Agn\u00e8s Varda\n* 2018: Hirokazu Kore-eda / Danny DeVito / Judi Dench\n* 2019: Pen\u00e9lope Cruz / Costa-Gavras / Donald Sutherland\n |\n| 2020s | * 2020: Viggo Mortensen\n* 2021: Johnny Depp / Marion Cotillard\n* 2022: Juliette Binoche / David Cronenberg\n* 2023: Javier Bardem / V\u00edctor Erice / Hayao Miyazaki\n* 2024: Cate Blanchett\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNational Board of Review Award for Best Actor\n |\n| --- |\n| 1945\u20131975 | * Ray Milland (1945)\n* Laurence Olivier (1946)\n* Michael Redgrave (1947)\n* Walter Huston (1948)\n* Ralph Richardson (1949)\n* Alec Guinness (1950)\n* Richard Basehart (1951)\n* Ralph Richardson (1952)\n* James Mason (1953)\n* Bing Crosby (1954)\n* Ernest Borgnine (1955)\n* Yul Brynner (1956)\n* Alec Guinness (1957)\n* Spencer Tracy (1958)\n* Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m (1959)\n* Robert Mitchum (1960)\n* Albert Finney (1961)\n* Jason Robards (1962)\n* Rex Harrison (1963)\n* Anthony Quinn (1964)\n* Lee Marvin (1965)\n* Paul Scofield (1966)\n* Peter Finch (1967)\n* Cliff Robertson (1968)\n* Peter O'Toole (1969)\n* George C.

He's a tough but adoring father, a grieving widower and a passionate defender of his wife's final wishes, and Mortensen plays all these notes, and more with subtlety and grace\".[41]\n\n\nIn 2018, he starred in the film *Green Book*. Mortensen portrayed Tony Lip, an Italian-American bouncer hired to drive and protect pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) on a tour through the Jim Crow South from 1962 to 1963. Reflecting on the character, Mortensen stated, \"I was attracted to playing Tony in part because it was a different kind of character, but the main thing I liked about him was his heart\".[42] Mortensen received his third Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Lip.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Keith Clark and Jon Mefford (2005). \"Between Two Worlds: The Making of *Witness*\". *Witness* (DVD).

He has received various recognitions including a Screen Actors Guild Award and two Young Artist Awards. Astin was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1994 for the short film *Kangaroo Court*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAstin was born in Santa Monica, California, on February 25, 1971, as the son of actress Patty Duke (1946\u20132016) and Michael Tell (born 1950).[2][3][4] However, at the time, it was reported that entertainer Desi Arnaz Jr. was his biological father. During that time, Duke also had a personal relationship with Michael Tell, a writer, music promoter, and publisher of the newspaper *The Las Vegas Israelite*. When Duke became pregnant, she was unsure whether Arnaz or Tell was the father, so Tell offered to marry her as a way out of the scandal. The marriage lasted only 13 days in 1970, and ended before Astin was born.[5][6][7]\n\n\nOn August 5, 1972, Duke married actor John Astin, having been in a relationship with him for two years. When the wedding guests were invited to speak, 18-month-old Astin looked at John and cried, \"Daddy!\", to which the Episcopal priest performing the ceremony remarked, \"Well, that about does it!\"[8] John subsequently adopted Astin. In 1973, Duke gave birth to Astin's brother Mackenzie Astin, who also became an actor. Duke and John Astin divorced in 1985.[9] Duke married Mike Pearce in 1986,[5] and they adopted a son, Kevin, in 1989.[9]\n\n\nWhen Astin was 14, Duke told him that Arnaz was his father, and the two developed a relationship. However, in his mid-20s, Astin met a relative of Michael Tell who suggested they were related. Sean set out to find the truth about his biological father, and underwent genetic tests which showed Tell was his biological father.[10] Astin has maintained close relationships with all three, and saying: \"Desi Arnaz Jr. loves me, and I love him. We are so close ... Science tells me ... that he's not my biological father. Science tells me that Mike Tell is.\" Astin considers John his father, as John was the one who raised him. Astin is also close to his stepfather, Mike Pearce, saying, \"I can call any of them on the phone any time I want to. John, Desi, Mike, or Papa Mike ... my four dads.\"[5]\n\n\nAstin is of German and Irish ancestry through his mother and Austrian Jewish and Polish Jewish through his biological father.[11][12][13] Astin attended Catholic school and later became a Protestant.[14]\n\n\nAstin attended the Crossroads High School for the Arts and undertook master classes at the Stella Adler Conservatory in Los Angeles. He graduated cum laude from UCLA with a B.A. in History and English (American literature and culture). An alumnus of Los Angeles Valley College, Astin served on the school's board of directors of the Patrons Association and the Arts Council.[15]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Astin in 1997\nAstin's first acting role was in a 1981 television film titled *Please Don't Hit Me, Mom*,[16] in which he played an 8-year-old child with an abusive mother (portrayed by his real-life mother Patty Duke). Astin made his film debut at the age of 13 as Mikey in *The Goonies* (1985).\n\n\nAfter *The Goonies*, Astin appeared in several more films, including the Disney television film *The B.R.A.T. Patrol*, opposite Nia Long, Tim Thomerson, and Brian Keith; *Like Father Like Son* (1987); *White Water Summer* with Kevin Bacon (1987), *The War of the Roses* (1989); the World War II film *Memphis Belle* (1990); *Toy Soldiers* (1991); *Encino Man* (1992); and the college football biopic *Rudy* (1993), about the life-changing struggles and rewards of the titular character, Daniel Ruettiger.\n\n\nIn 1994, Astin directed and co-produced (with his wife, Christine Astin) the short film *Kangaroo Court*, which received an Academy Award nomination for Best Live Action Short Film. Astin continued to appear in films throughout the 1990s, including the Showtime science fiction film *Harrison Bergeron* (1995), the Gulf War film *Courage Under Fire* (1996), and the Warren Beatty political satire *Bulworth* (1998).\n\n\n\n### *The Lord of the Rings*[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, Astin played Samwise Gamgee in Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy, consisting of *The Fellowship of the Ring* (2001), *The Two Towers* (2002), and *The Return of the King* (2003). Many awards were bestowed upon the trilogy, particularly its final installment, which earned eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Astin received seven award nominations for his own performance, and won five, including the Saturn Award, the Sierra Award, the Seattle Film Critics Award, and the Utah Film Critics Award (all for Best Supporting Actor), and the Visual Effects Society Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male or Female in an Effects Film.[17][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] *The Return of the King* cast as an ensemble received awards from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, the Screen Actors Guild, the Broadcast Film Critics Association, and received a Gold Derby Award.[18][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nThroughout the filming process, Astin became close friends with several cast members, and became particularly good friends with costar Elijah Wood. Astin's daughter, Alexandra, is in the closing scene of *The Return of the King*. She plays his onscreen daughter, Elanor Gamgee, who runs out to him as he returns from the Grey Havens.\n\n\nWhile working on *The Lord of the Rings*, Astin persuaded a number of fellow cast and crew members, including director Peter Jackson, to assist him in making his second short film, *The Long and Short of It*. The film, which takes place on a street in Wellington, New Zealand, premiered at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival and can be found on the DVD for *The Two Towers*, along with a \"making of\" video.\n\n\nIn 2004, Astin released *There and Back Again* (ISBN\u00a00-312-33146-0), a memoir (co-written with Joe Layden) of his film career with emphasis on his experiences during production of *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The title is derived from the title of J. R. R. Tolkien's novel *The Hobbit*, as well as the fictional book written by Bilbo Baggins in *The Lord of the Rings*.\n\n\n\n### After *The Lord of the Rings*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Astin at UIUC, 2009\nSince *The Lord of the Rings*, Astin has continued to work in film and television. His film roles have included the Adam Sandler comedies *50 First Dates* and *Click*. Astin played the role of Malibu High School principal Mike Matthews in the film *Smile*.[19][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nIn television, Astin guest-starred as Lynn McGill in ten episodes of the fifth season of the Fox drama *24*. He also appeared in the made-for-TV films *Hercules* and *The Colour of Magic* and in episodes of *Monk*, *Las Vegas*, *My Name is Earl* (in which he parodied his 1993 film *Rudy* with co-stars Charles S.

He made his breakthrough as the character Legolas in *The Lord of the Rings* film series. He reprised his role in *The Hobbit* film series. Considered by some to be the Errol Flynn of his time,[4][5][6] he gained further notice appearing in epic fantasy, historical, and adventure films, notably as Will Turner in the *Pirates of the Caribbean* film series, Paris in *Troy* (2004), Balian de Ibelin in *Kingdom of Heaven* (2005), and the Duke of Buckingham in *The Three Musketeers* (2011).\n\n\nBloom appeared in Hollywood films such as the war film *Black Hawk Down* (2001), the Australian Western *Ned Kelly* (2003), the romantic comedy *Elizabethtown* (2005), and *New York, I Love You* (2007). In 2020 he gained acclaim for the Afghanistan War drama film *The Outpost* (2020). He also starred in the Amazon Prime Video series *Carnival Row* (2019\u20132023).\n\n\nHe made his professional stage debut in *In Celebration* at the Duke of York's Theatre in the West End in 2007 and starred in a Broadway adaptation of William Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet* in 2013. He returned to the theatre in a West End revival of Tracy Letts' *Killer Joe* in 2018. In 2009, Bloom was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. In 2015 he received the BAFTA Britannia Humanitarian Award.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBloom was born on 13 January 1977 in Canterbury, Kent, and was named after the 16th-century English composer Orlando Gibbons.[8][9] He has an older sister, Samantha Bloom.[10]\n\n\nBloom initially believed that his biological father was his mother's husband, the South African-born anti-apartheid novelist Harry Bloom (1913\u20131981), who died when Bloom was four years old. However, when he was thirteen, Bloom's mother revealed to him that his biological father was actually Colin Stone, his mother's partner and family friend.[11][12][13] Stone, the principal of the Concorde International language school,[14] became Orlando Bloom's legal guardian after Harry Bloom's death.[13]\n\n\nBloom's mother, Sonia Constance Josephine (*n\u00e9e* Copeland), was born in Kolkata, India, the daughter of British parents Francis John Copeland, a physician and surgeon, and Betty Constance Josephine (*n\u00e9e* Walker), who were from Kent. Through her, Bloom is a cousin of photographer Sebastian Copeland.[15][16] Bloom's mother's family lived in Tasmania (Australia), Japan, and India.[11]\n\n\nBloom was brought up in the Church of England.[17] He attended St Peter's Methodist Primary School,[18] then the junior school of The King's School before proceeding to St Edmund's School Canterbury. Bloom was discovered to be dyslexic,[13][19] and was encouraged by his mother to take art and drama classes.[13] After being spurred into action following his school prize submission to panto actor Richard Sieben in 1992, in 1993, he moved to London to follow a two-year A-Level course in Drama, Photography and Sculpture at Fine Arts College, Hampstead. He then joined the National Youth Theatre, spending two seasons there and earning a scholarship to train at the British American Drama Academy.[20] Bloom began acting professionally with television roles in episodes of *Casualty* and *Midsomer Murders*,[13] and subsequently made his film debut in *Wilde* (1997), opposite Stephen Fry, before entering the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where he studied acting.[21]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nBloom's first appearance on the screen was in a small role, as a rent boy, in the 1997 film *Wilde*. Two days after graduating from Guildhall in 1999,[22] he was cast in his first major role, playing Legolas in *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy (2001\u20132003).[20] He had originally auditioned for the part of Faramir, who does not appear until the second movie, but the director, Peter Jackson, cast him as Legolas instead. While shooting a scene, he broke a rib after falling off a horse, but eventually recovered and continued shooting.[23] At the same time, Bloom also played a brief role in Ridley Scott's war film *Black Hawk Down* as PFC Todd Blackburn. In 2002, he was chosen as one of the *Teen People* \"25 Hottest Stars Under 25\", despite him having turned 25, and was named *People*'s hottest Hollywood bachelor in the magazine's 2004 list.[20] All members of the cast of the Rings films were nominated for Best Ensemble Acting at the Screen Actors Guild Awards for three years in a row, finally winning in 2003 for the third film, *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*. Bloom has also won other awards, including European Film Awards, Hollywood Festival Award, Empire Awards and Teen Choice Awards, and has been nominated for many others. Most of Bloom's box office successes have been as part of an ensemble cast.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bloom at the 2005 Venice Film Festival\nBloom next starred opposite Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp in *Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl*, which was a blockbuster hit during the summer of 2003. After the success of *Pirates*, Bloom next took to the screen as Paris, the man who effectively started the Trojan War, in the 2004 Spring blockbuster, *Troy* opposite Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole. He subsequently played the lead roles in Ridley Scott's *Kingdom of Heaven* and Cameron Crowe's *Elizabethtown* (both 2005). In 2006, Bloom starred in sequel *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* and in the independently made *Haven*, of which he was also executive producer. In the same year he was one of the guest stars in the sitcom *Extras*, in which he portrayed an exaggeratedly arrogant, narcissistic version of himself who had a great loathing for Johnny Depp (his co-star in *Pirates of the Caribbean*); Bloom pushed for *Extras* to go further by making his part unlikable, and contributed to the gag about him admiring Depp out of sheer jealousy, that Depp was far more talented than he was, not to mention rated higher than him on the 'top hottest' charts.[25] Also in 2006, Bloom was the most searched male on Google News.[13] As of May 2007, Bloom has appeared in four of the top 15 highest-grossing films of all time.[22]\n\n\nBloom then again portrayed Will Turner, in *Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End*, released on 24 May 2007. Bloom, who had intended to become a stage actor after graduating from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, had stated that he would like to leave films for a time and instead appear in stage roles,[20] and is \"avidly looking for the right sort of material that [he] can do something with\"[26] and go \"back to basics.\"[27] During the summer of 2007, he appeared in a London revival of *In Celebration*, a play by David Storey.[27][28] His character was one of three brothers returning home for their parents' 40th wedding anniversary.[29] On 24 August 2007 he made his first ever TV commercial appearance on late-night Japanese TV, promoting the Uno brand of cosmetics maker Shiseido. A \"one night only\", 2-minute version of the Sci-Fi themed commercial kicked off the product's marketing campaign.[30] In 2008 he signed on to play a small role in the British film *An Education*[31] but dropped out to take the lead in Johnnie To's film *Red Circle*. Also in 2009, he was one of many stars to appear in *New York, I Love You*, which contained 12 short films in one.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bloom at the 2010 *Cinema for Peace* gala in Berlin, Germany\nBloom appeared in *The Three Musketeers* opposite Milla Jovovich, Logan Lerman, Matthew Macfadyen, Ray Stevenson, Luke Evans, Juno Temple and Christoph Waltz, released in 2011. Bloom reprised his role as Legolas in parts two and three of *The Hobbit*, Peter Jackson's three-part prequel to *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy.[32] He made his Broadway stage debut as Romeo in *Romeo and Juliet* in August 2013 at the Richard Rodgers Theatre.[33] *The New York Times* theatre critic Ben Brantley described Bloom's performance as \"a first-rate Broadway debut\" in the title role: \"For once, we have a Romeo who evolves substantively, from a posturing youth in love with love, to a man who discovers the startling revelation of real love, with a last-act descent into bilious, bitter anger that verges on madness.\"[34]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Bloom stated that he would like to return for a fifth *Pirates of the Caribbean* film. Bloom did reprise his character, Will Turner, in a supporting role in the fifth film, *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales*, which was released in May 2017.[35]\n\n\nBloom starred in the Trafalgar Studios production of *Killer Joe* in 2018. Bloom is currently starring in the Amazon Prime TV show *Carnival Row*, which was filming its second season in Prague before temporarily postponing production due to COVID-19. Together with a number of his *Lord of the Rings* co-stars (plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson), on 1 June 2020 he joined Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart* which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[36]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Bloom starred in the war film *The Outpost* in which he portrayed the character of captain Benjamin Keating. In 2023, he played Danny Moore, a Nissan marketing executive in the sports film *Gran Turismo* based on the true story of Jann Mardenborough.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bloom at the 2015 British Fashion Awards\nBloom has said that he tries \"not to exclude himself from real life as much as possible.\"[13] During filming in Morocco for *Kingdom of Heaven*, Bloom rescued and adopted a dog, Sidi (a black Saluki mix with a white mark on his chest).[37][38]\n\n\nIn 2004, he became a full member of SGI-UK (the UK branch of Soka Gakkai International), a lay Buddhist association affiliated with the teachings of Nichiren.[39][40]\n\n\nBloom has also been a part of Global Green, an environmental company, since the early 2000s.[24] As part of his environmental involvement, he has renovated his London home to use solar panels, incorporate recycled materials, and has used energy efficient lightbulbs.[13][24] Bloom has been approached by UNICEF to act as an international ambassador.[24]\n\n\nInvolved in modelling work, in 2002 he starred opposite English actress Kate Beckinsale in a Gap television advertisement directed by Cameron Crowe.[41]\n\n\nBloom has a tattoo of the Elvish word \"nine\" on his right wrist, written in fictional Tengwar Elvish script, a reference to his involvement in *The Lord of the Rings* as one of the nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring. The other actors of \"The Fellowship\" (Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, and Elijah Wood) got the same tattoo with the exception of John Rhys-Davies whose stunt double got the tattoo instead.[42][43][44][45] Bloom also has a tattoo of a sun on his lower left abdomen, which he got at age 15 before moving to London.\n\n\nOn 12 February 2009, Bloom actively participated in the 'Australia Unites' fundraiser to raise support for the victims of the Australian bushfires on 7 February 2009.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Appointed UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2009, Bloom speaking to a schoolboy in Ukraine in 2016\nOn 12 October 2009, Bloom was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. He has been involved in the organisation since 2007 and has visited schools and villages in Nepal in support of sanitation and education programmes.[47] Bloom also visited the city of Sloviansk in the east of Ukraine in April 2016 to raise awareness of the education crisis facing children during the Russo-Ukrainian war in 2014\u20132015.[48] In 2023, Bloom returned to Ukraine again as a Goodwill Ambassador. Bloom met children affected by the war at a children's centre in Kyiv and met Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[49]\n\n\nBloom has sustained several injuries: he broke his left arm and cracked his skull three times, broke his nose while playing rugby union, broke his right leg skiing in Switzerland, broke his left leg in a motorbike crash, and broke his right wrist while snowboarding.[22] He also broke his back when he slipped trying to reach a roof terrace of a friend's house and fell three floors.[50] He also broke some ribs while shooting *The Lord of the Rings*.[51]\n\n\nOn 13 July 2009, four hooded teenagers broke into the Hollywood Hills home of Bloom and stole nearly half a million dollars' worth of possessions. The burglars, dubbed the \"Bling Ring,\" targeted the homes of celebrities.

He has also received three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations with one win, and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.\n\n\n\n![](image)John Rhys-Davies at Galaxy Con Richmond in 2023\nRhys-Davies is also known for his performances in the films *Victor/Victoria* (1982), *The Living Daylights* (1987), *The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement* (2004), and *Aquaman* (2018). He is also known for his extensive voice work including *Aladdin and the King of Thieves* (1996), *The Jungle Book 2* (2003), *Gargoyles* (1995\u20131996), and *SpongeBob SquarePants* (2000\u20132002).\n\n\nHe also gained acclaim for his television roles as Macro in *I, Claudius* (1976), Vasco Rodrigues in *Sh\u014dgun* (1980), and Michael Malone in *The Untouchables* (1993). From 1995 to 1997 he portrayed Professor Maximillian Arturo in *Sliders*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies was born in Salisbury on 5 May 1944,[1] the son of Welsh parents. His mother, Phyllis Jones, was a nurse, while his father, Rhys Davies, was a mechanical engineer and colonial officer.[2]\n\n\nDue to his father's work as a colonial police officer, he was raised in Tanganyika (today part of Tanzania) before his family moved to the Welsh town of Ammanford.[1] While in Tanganyika, his family lived in places such as Dar es Salaam, Kongwa, Moshi, and Mwanza. He was educated at independent Truro School in Cornwall and then at the University of East Anglia, where he was one of the first 105 students admitted and became a co-founder of its drama club. After a stint teaching at a secondary school in Watton, Norfolk, he won a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhys-Davies (right) signing autographs in May 2005\nRhys-Davies appeared sporadically on UK television in the early 1970s, including his role as the gangster \"Laughing Spam Fritter\" opposite Adam Faith in *Budgie*. Later he played Praetorian officer Naevius Sutorius Macro in *I, Claudius*. He then began to appear more frequently, and not just in the UK, with roles as a Portuguese navigator Rodrigues in the 1980 television miniseries *Shogun*, based on the novel by James Clavell, and as Sallah in the 1981 film *Raiders of the Lost Ark*.[3] He reprised the role of Sallah in two subsequent *Indiana Jones* films.[4]\n\n\nIn 1989, he played Marvel Comics character Kingpin in *The Trial of the Incredible Hulk*.[5] Rhys-Davies also starred in another Clavell adaption, *Noble House*, set in Hong Kong, in which he plays Ian Dunross' corporate enemy, Quillan Gornt.[6] He has since appeared in numerous television shows and miniseries, including Agent Michael Malone in the 1993 remake of the 1950s television series *The Untouchables*[7] as well as a leading role in the television series *Sliders* as Professor Maximillian Arturo from 1995 to 1997.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)John Rhys Davies at Galaxy Con Richmond in 2023\nHe also appeared in *Reilly, Ace of Spies* in 1983, made several appearances in *Star Trek: Voyager* as a holodeck version of Leonardo da Vinci,[9] starred as an ally of James Bond in *The Living Daylights*, and appeared in the film *One Night with the King*. Davies has played the character Porthos in two separate projects; a two-part episode of *The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne*, and the Hallmark Channel film *La Femme Musketeer*. He appears in the full motion video cut scenes of computer games including *Ripper* (as Vigo Haman) (1996), *Dune 2000* (as Noree Moneo) (1998), and the *Wing Commander* series (as James Taggart, doubling as the voice of Thrakhath nar Kiranka in the third game of the series).\n\n\nIn 2004, he narrated *The Privileged Planet*, a documentary that makes the case for intelligent design.[10] He also provided narration in the MTV series Wildboyz around this time. In 2013, he appeared in the family history programme *Coming Home*, in which he discovered information about his grandfather's life in the Carmarthenshire coal mines.[11]\n\n\nIn 2014, he joined the cast of the television show *Metal Hurlant Chronicles* to play Holgarth, an immortal alchemist.[12]\n\n\nIn 2015, he had a role in the single-player campaign of the PC game *Star Citizen* alongside Mark Hamill and Gary Oldman.[13] The work consisted of full body motion capture, including facial expressions and his voice; it was recorded primarily at the Imaginarium studios in the UK.[14]\n\n\n\n### *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy[edit]\n\n\nRhys-Davies appeared as the dwarf Gimli in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The cinematography of the films was aided in that Rhys-Davies is tall \u2013 6\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in (1.85\u00a0m), compared to the actors playing hobbits at around 5\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.68\u00a0m).[15] Therefore, although his character was supposed to be short, he was properly in proportion compared to the hobbit actors. Had he been of more similar height, shots of the entire fellowship would have required three camera passes rather than two.[16]\n\n\nRhys-Davies is the only one of the nine Fellowship of the Ring actors who did not receive a tattoo of the word \"nine\" written in the Tengwar script; his stunt double, Brett Beattie, was offered the tattoo instead as Rhys-Davies was disinclined to get one himself and Beattie had spent so much time as his double that he almost received co-credit.[17]\n\n\nRhys-Davies suffered severe reactions to the prosthetics used during filming, and his eyes sometimes swelled shut. When asked whether he would consider returning to the role for the film version of *The Hobbit*, he said, \"I have already completely ruled it out. There's a sentimental part of me that would love to be involved again. Really I am not sure my face can take that sort of punishment any more.\" He added that this time around \"[t]hey've got a different set of problems\u00a0... because you've got 13 dwarves, a whole band of them\u00a0... You're trying to represent a whole race\u00a0... You're trying to do for dwarves what *The Lord of the Rings* did for hobbits.\"[18] He offered help as a dwarf advisor in 2011, but ruled out returning as Gimli in *The Hobbit* because of the punishing makeup required.[19]\n\n\n\n### Voice work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhys-Davies in September 2012\nIn addition to voicing the Ent Treebeard in *Lord of the Rings*, Rhys-Davies has lent his distinctive voice to many video games and animated television series, including the role of Hades in *Justice League*, the original voice of Man Ray in *SpongeBob SquarePants* (until both roles were recast to Bob Joles), and numerous times in *Gargoyles* (1994\u20131996), as the character Macbeth. He also lent his vocal talents to the games *Freelancer* (as Richard Winston Tobias) and *Lords of Everquest* (both in 2003) and the game *Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness*, which was released with his narration on a CD-ROM version in 1995. He also had a voice role on *Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance* as the character Jherek, and narrated a documentary called *The Glory of Macedonia*. Next Generation magazine gave its *Dune 2000* review 'an automatic one-star deduction for featuring John \"Multimedia Whore\" Rhys-Davies in the FMV.'[20]\n\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies' voice can be heard on the 2009 documentary *Reclaiming The Blade*.[21] In the narration, Rhys-Davies explores swords, historical European swordsmanship and fight choreography on film, a topic very familiar to him from his experiences in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy, where his character wielded an axe in many scenes.\n\n\nIn 2004, he was the unknowing subject of an internet prank that spread false rumours in several mainstream media sources that he was scheduled to play the role of General Grievous in *Star Wars Episode III*.[22]\n\n\nRhys-Davies is the narrator of *The Truth & Life Dramatized audio New Testament Bible*, a 22-hour, celebrity-voiced, fully dramatised audiobook version of the New Testament which uses the Revised Standard Version-Catholic Edition translation. In 2011, he presented *KJB: The Book That Changed The World*, which features him reading diverse snippets from the King James Version.\n\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies\u2019 voice work also includes voice-over work with *Breathe Bible*.[23]\n\n\nIn 2016, he provided spoken words for *Voices of Fire*, the sixth album by a cappella power metal band van Canto.[24]\n\n\nA resident of the Isle of Man since 1988, John Rhys-Davies provides the introductory voice-over to the Island's Castle Rushen, one of the best-preserved medieval fortresses in the British Isles. In 2018, he lent his voice to the Isle of Man's tourism commercial.\n\n\nRhys-Davies voice was recorded for some of the callouts in the 1993 Williams SuperPin *Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure*[25]\n\n\n  \n\nIn the 2023 game Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, he reprises the role of voicing Gimli and can be heard narrating the opening scene.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhys-Davies in April 2013\nRhys-Davies married Suzanne Wilkinson in December 1966, and they had two sons together. Although they legally separated in 1985, they remained married until her death from Alzheimer's disease in 2010. They remained friends, and he took care of her in her final years.[26]\n\n\nIn 2004, Rhys-Davies began dating Lisa Manning. They have a daughter together, and split their time between homes in the New Zealand region of Waikato[27] and on the Isle of Man.[28]\n\n\n\n### Religious views[edit]\n\n\nRhys-Davies is a self-described \"rationalist\" and \"sceptic\" when it comes to religion. However, he holds Christianity in high regard and has stated that \"Christian civilisation has made the world a better place than it ever was.\"\n\n\nIn February 2020, Rhys-Davies stated, \"All the things that we value, the right of free speech, the right of the individual conscience, these evolved in first and second century Roman Christendom, where the individual Christian said, 'I have a right to believe, what I believe and not what the Emperor tells me.' From that our whole idea of democracy and the equality that we have has developed. We owe Christianity the greatest debt of thanks that a generation can ever have, and to slight it and to dismiss it as being irrelevant is the detritus of rather ill-read minds, I think.\"[29][30]\n\n\n\n### Political views[edit]\n\n\nRhys-Davies is not a member of any political party. He was a radical leftist as a university student in the 1960s, but changed his views when he went to heckle Margaret Thatcher, who he said \"shot down the first two hecklers in such brilliant fashion that [he] decided [he] ought for once to shut up and listen\".[31]\n\n\nIn 2004, Rhys-Davies said in an interview with *World* magazine, \"There is a demographic catastrophe happening in Europe that nobody wants to talk about, that we daren't bring up because we are so cagey about not offending people racially. And rightly we should be. But there is a cultural thing as well. By 2020, 50% of the children in Holland under the age of 18 will be of Muslim descent.\"[32] In an interview with the conservative journal *National Review*, he said that he is opposed to Islamic extremism because he feels that it violates the \"Western values\" of equality, democracy, tolerance, and the abolition of slavery.[31]\n\n\nRhys-Davies was vocal about his support for Brexit.[33] On 25 April 2019, he appeared as a panelist on the BBC's *Question Time*, where he debated Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election with Green Party politician Caroline Lucas. After Lucas suggested Trump should not be afforded a state visit to the UK, due to having lost the popular vote, Rhys-Davies banged his hands on the table and shouted \"\u201cOh woman! Have you never read Kenneth Arrow and the Arrows theorem?\" His conduct was subsequently described as \"thuggish and sexist\" by some viewers.[34][35] Rhys-Davies has since commented on his response, saying \"I was annoyed. It\u2019s impossible to gather your thoughts when you\u2019ve got someone making faces and twittering.

He is best known for playing Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck in Peter Jackson's film trilogy *The Lord of the Rings* (2001\u20132003), and Charlie Pace on the ABC television drama *Lost* (2004\u20132010).\n\n\nMonaghan first gained fame as Hetty Wainthropp's sidekick Geoffrey in *Hetty Wainthropp Investigates* (1996\u20131998). His first film role was as Sasha in the television film *Hostile Waters* (1997) based on the true story of a Soviet and a US submarine colliding in the Cold War. His other film roles include playing the young mutant Chris Bradley formerly known as Maverick in the superhero film *X-Men Origins: Wolverine* (2009) and playing Beaumont Kin in *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* (2019), reuniting with J.J. Abrams, the co-creator of *Lost.* He also has hosted the nature programme *Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan* (2012\u20132016).\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMonaghan was born in West Berlin, West Germany, to British parents: Maureen, a nurse, and Austin Monaghan, who was of Irish descent, a science teacher.[3] Monaghan's family lived in Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Stuttgart and M\u00fcnster, moving about every four years. When he was about 11 years old, his family moved to Heaton Moor in Stockport, England.[4] In Stockport, he attended St Anne's Roman Catholic High School (where his uncle taught and later became head teacher) and Aquinas College, where he studied English literature, drama and geography.\n\n\n\n## Career and events[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Monaghan held many occupations when he was younger, he long wanted to be an actor. After his second year at St Anne's, Monaghan became a regular in school plays such as *Oliver Twist*, *A Christmas Carol* and *Bugsy Malone* before joining the Manchester Youth Theatre. There, he was scouted for *Hetty Wainthropp Investigates*, in which he starred alongside Patricia Routledge and Derek Benfield as Hetty's under-aged sidekick, Geoffrey Shawcross, for four series. Monaghan has since credited Routledge as \"an amazing teacher\" who taught him some \"very valuable lessons\" that have influenced his acting career.[5][6][*non-primary source needed*] He made his feature-film debut as Russian sailor Sasha in the TV film *Hostile Waters*.[7]\n\n\nMonaghan later starred in *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy as Meriadoc Brandybuck, for which he achieved international acclaim and success. Monaghan narrated *Ringers: Lord of the Fans*, a documentary about *The Lord of the Rings* fandom. He also provided the narration for The Discovery Channel's documentary *Devil's Bible* in 2008. He also appeared in *Soldiers of Fortune* alongside Sean Bean and Christian Slater. \nHe was a regular cast member on the ABC series *Lost* from 2004 to 2007, playing English former rockstar and drug addict Charlie Pace. Monaghan originally auditioned for the role of Sawyer. The role of Charlie was then changed from an old, washed up rocker from the 1980s, to a young one-hit wonder to accommodate Monaghan's age. Monaghan returned to the series as a special guest star after departing from the main cast.\n\n\nIn 2009, Monaghan starred as Chris Bradley / Bolt in *X-Men Origins: Wolverine*. On 15 July 2009, it was confirmed that he would join the cast of ABC Studios' science-fiction television series *FlashForward* as the character Simon. The series premiered on 24 September 2009.[8] It was cancelled after its first season.[9]\n\n\nOn 18 March 2010, Monaghan was spotted at the Universal Sheraton filming a short titled *Gloria*. It was part of a programme titled REESES Puff's Extraordinary Cinema (where the teenagers replace the pros[*clarification needed*]). He played the part of Caleb Reese.[10][11]\n\n\nIn 2010, Monaghan and US actress Megan Fox made an appearance as a couple in an abusive relationship in the music video for Rihanna and Eminem's song \"Love the Way You Lie\". Scenes include the celebrities on top of a liquor store. Fox and Monaghan also filmed inside the store and \"at a seedy dive bar next door\" to the store.[12]\n\n\nIn November 2012, a new show on Channel 5 titled *Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan* started airing in the United Kingdom. The documentary shows Monaghan travelling to different locations such as Venezuela and Ecuador to film and interact with the exotic and often dangerous local wildlife.[13]\n\n\nDuring the summer of 2013, Monaghan appeared in various live-action teasers for 2K Marin's science-fiction video game *The Bureau: XCOM Declassified*.[14]\n\n\nMonaghan is a fan of *The Gaffer Tapes: Fantasy Football Podcast* and has appeared as a guest in both April-November 2016 and May 2018, as well as submitting several audio questions which are played on the podcast. While appearing as a guest, Monaghan said \"It's the best fantasy football podcast out there\".[15]\n\n\nMonaghan is a contributing writer for the music and culture magazine *Paste*, primarily writing articles about Premier League football.[16]\n\n\nMonaghan is the voice of Sightseeing Manchester's bus tour, recorded in March 2016.\n\n\nSince August 2018, he has been starring as a serial killer in Channel 9 Australia's murder-mystery/drama TV series *Bite Club*, which is filmed in and around Sydney.\n\n\nHe was named as part of the cast for the last film in the sequel trilogy which is *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*, reuniting with J.J. Abrams, the co-creator of *Lost*. He appeared as Beaumont.\n\n\nIn May 2020, Monaghan joined together with fellow *Lord of the Rings* castmates Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, Karl Urban, and Elijah Wood, along with writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson, to appear on Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart,* which reunites the cast of popular films through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[17] Monaghan and castmate Billy Boyd started the podcast *The Friendship Onion* where they talk about their time filming *The Lord of the Rings*.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMonaghan is a nature lover and has been active in the planting of trees and cacti. He bought a mango-tree forest in India.[18] Monaghan has a great love for insects and reptiles that he developed during his childhood, and has kept an exotic assortment of pets, including a leaf-mantis named Gizmo, a black widow spider named Witchitar and an albino snake named Blink.[19] The newly discovered species of spider *Ctenus monaghani* (de:Ctenus monaghani) is named after him.[20]\n\n\nAn avid outdoorsman, Monaghan enjoys activities such as surfing, kayaking, snowboarding, football, basketball and hiking. He has also explained that he likes hunting for insects and reptiles outdoors. He learned karate as a child, used to practise yoga and often goes to the gym for strength and weight training. He is a longtime fan of Manchester United since his childhood.[21]\n\n\nMonaghan loves to play all games and has hosted game nights for fellow cast members in the past, and is also fond of *The New York Times*' crossword puzzle. He enjoys playing *League of Legends* with fellow *Lord of the Rings* cast member Billy Boyd. He is fluent in English and German.[22]\n\n\nOn his right arm he has a tattoo of the English word \"nine\" written in the artificial script of Tengwar, a reference to his involvement in *The Lord of the Rings* and the fact that his character was one of the nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring. Seven other cast members and John Rhys-Davies' stunt double also got matching tattoos during the film's production, at Monaghan's instigation. Below that tattoo is another that reads, \"Life imitates art\", an Oscar Wilde quote. On his left arm is a tattoo, \"Living is easy with eyes closed\", a line from The Beatles' \"Strawberry Fields Forever\". He also has two stars tattooed on his left foot: one black, and one white.[23] In 2010, Monaghan got two more tattoos, one on the upper side of the back (\"Love you take is equal to the love you make\", taken from the song \"The End\" by The Beatles). The other, done by Kat Von D on the reality TV series *LA Ink*, is located on his lower right arm and reads \"Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter\", a quote from Yoda.\n\n\nHe resides in Los Angeles, California. In 2008, Monaghan held a photographic exhibition in Los Angeles in which he sold prints of his own works. A portion of the proceeds from the exhibition were given to an orangutan rescue organisation.\n\n\nMonaghan was in a relationship with his *Lost* co-star Evangeline Lilly from 2004 until 2007.[24]\n\n\nIn June 2008, Monaghan travelled to Argentina with Lilly to film the pilot of the US version of *CQC*.[25]\n\n\nMonaghan provided the inspiration for the naming of Billy Boyd's band Beecake after he sent his friend a picture of a cake covered in bees.[26]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* | Meriadoc Brandybuck | Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best CastNominated\u2014Empire Award for Best NewcomerNominated\u2014Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture |\n| 2002\n | *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* | Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best CastNominated\u2014Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture |\n| 2003\n | *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* | Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Acting EnsembleNational Board of Review Award for Best CastOnline Film Critics Society Award for Best CastScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion PictureNominated\u2014Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Cast\n |\n| *An Insomniac's Nightmare* | Jack\n | Short film\n |\n| 2004\n | *Spivs* | Goat\n |  |\n| *The Purifiers* | Sol\n |  |\n| 2005\n | *Ringers: Lord of the Fans* | Narrator\n | Voice\n |\n| *Shooting Livien* | Owen Scott\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *I Sell the Dead* | Arthur Blake\n |  |\n| 2009\n | *X-Men Origins: Wolverine* | Chris Bradley | Nominated\u2014People's Choice Award for Favorite On-Screen Team |\n| 2011\n | *The Day* | Rick\n |  |\n| 2012\n | *The Millionaire Tour* | Casper\n |  |\n| *Soldiers of Fortune* | Tommy Sin\n |  |\n| 2015\n | *Molly Moon and the Incredible Book of Hypnotism* | Nockman\n |  |\n| 2016\n | *Pet* | Seth\n |  |\n| 2017\n | *Atomica* | Robinson Scott\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *Mute* | Oswald\n |  |\n| *Waterlily Jaguar* | Bill\n |  |\n| 2019\n | *Radioflash* | Chris\n |  |\n| 2019\n | *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* | Beaumont Kin\n |  |\n| 2021\n | *Edge of the World* | Colonel Arthur Crookshank\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *Last Looks* | Warren Gomes\n |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1996\u201398\n | *Hetty Wainthropp Investigates* | Geoffrey Shawcross\n | 27 episodes\n |\n| 1997\n | *Hostile Waters* | Sasha\n | Television film\n |\n| 2000\n | *This Is Personal: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper* | Jimmy Furey\n |\n| *Monsignor Renard* | Etienne Pierre Rollinger\n | 3 episodes\n |\n| 2004\n | *I Love the '90s* | Himself\n | Commentator\n |\n| 2004\u20132010\n | *Lost* | Charlie Pace | 65 episodesScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama SeriesNominated\u2014Monte-Carlo Television Festival Award for Outstanding Actor \u2013 Drama SeriesNominated\u2014Prism Award for Performance in a Drama SeriesNominated\u2014Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television |\n| 2005\n | *I Love the '90s: Part Deux* | Himself\n | Commentator\n |\n| 2008\n | *MADtv* | Himself\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| *Caiga Quien Caiga* | Episode: \"#12.15\"\n |\n| 2009\n | *Chuck* | Tyler Martin\n | Episode: \"Chuck Versus the Third Dimension\"\n |\n| 2009\u20132010\n | *FlashForward* | Dr. Simon Campos\n | 15 episodes\n |\n| 2010\n | *Top Gear* | Himself\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| 2012\n | *The Unknown* | Mark Nickel\n | 6 episodes\n |\n| *Childrens Hospital* | Dr. Owen Maestro\n | \"British Hospital\"\n |\n| 2012\u20132016\n | *Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan* | Himself\n | 30 episodesNominated\u2014Canadian Screen Award for Best Science or Nature Documentary Program/SeriesNominated\u2014Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Reality SeriesNominated\u2014OFTA Award for Best Host or Panelist in a Non-Fiction ProgramNominated\u2014Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Unstructured Reality Program |\n| 2013\n | *Ridiculousness* | \"Dominic Monaghan\"\n |\n| *The Eric Andre Show* | \"Krysten Ritter/Dominic Monaghan\"\n |\n| 2015\n | *100 Code* | Tommy Conley\n | 12 episodes\n |\n| 2017\n | *Sofia the First* | Fig\n | Voice;
