The first Pok\u00e9mon, Bulbasaur, is number 001 and the last, Mew, is number 151. Alternate forms that result in type changes are included for convenience. Mega evolutions and regional forms are included on the pages for the generation in which they were introduced. MissingNo., a glitch, is also on this list.\n\n\n\n\n## Design and development[edit]\n\n\nThe majority of Pok\u00e9mon in generation I had relatively simple designs and were similar to real-life creatures including Pidgey (a pigeon), Krabby (a crab), Rattata (a rat), and Ekans (a snake). Many Pok\u00e9mon in the original games served as the base for repeating concepts later in the series.[1]\n\n\n\n## Table of Dexes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Dex name | No. of Pok\u00e9mon in Dex | No. in National Dex | percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kanto Dex [Red, Green, Blue and Yellow]\n | 151\n | 151\n | 100%  100%\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n |\n\n\n## List of Pok\u00e9mon[edit]\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n* Bulbasaur\n* Ivysaur\n* Venusaur\n* Charmander\n* Charmeleon\n* Charizard\n* Squirtle\n* Wartortle\n* Blastoise\n* Caterpie\n* Metapod\n* Butterfree\n* Weedle\n* Kakuna\n* Beedrill\n* Pidgey\n* Pidgeotto\n* Pidgeot\n* Rattata\n* Raticate\n* Spearow\n* Fearow\n* Ekans\n* Arbok\n* Pikachu\n* Raichu\n* Sandshrew\n* Sandslash\n* Nidoran\u2640\n* Nidorina\n* Nidoqueen\n* Nidoran\u2642\n* Nidorino\n* Nidoking\n* Clefairy\n* Clefable\n* Vulpix\n* Ninetales\n* Jigglypuff\n* Wigglytuff\n* Zubat\n* Golbat\n* Oddish\n* Gloom\n* Vileplume\n* Paras\n* Parasect\n* Venonat\n* Venomoth\n* Diglett\n* Dugtrio\n* Meowth\n* Persian\n* Psyduck\n* Golduck\n* Mankey\n* Primeape\n* Growlithe\n* Arcanine\n* Poliwag\n* Poliwhirl\n* Poliwrath\n* Abra\n* Kadabra\n* Alakazam\n* Machop\n* Machoke\n* Machamp\n* Bellsprout\n* Weepinbell\n* Victreebel\n* Tentacool\n* Tentacruel\n* Geodude\n* Graveler\n* Golem\n* Ponyta\n* Rapidash\n* Slowpoke\n* Slowbro\n* Magnemite\n* Magneton\n* Farfetch'd\n* Doduo\n* Dodrio\n* Seel\n* Dewgong\n* Grimer\n* Muk\n* Shellder\n* Cloyster\n* Gastly\n* Haunter\n* Gengar\n* Onix\n* Drowzee\n* Hypno\n* Krabby\n* Kingler\n* Voltorb\n* Electrode\n* Exeggcute\n* Exeggutor\n* Cubone\n* Marowak\n* Hitmonlee\n* Hitmonchan\n* Lickitung\n* Koffing\n* Weezing\n* Rhyhorn\n* Rhydon\n* Chansey\n* Tangela\n* Kangaskhan\n* Horsea\n* Seadra\n* Goldeen\n* Seaking\n* Staryu\n* Starmie\n* Mr. Mime\n* Scyther\n* Jynx\n* Electabuzz\n* Magmar\n* Pinsir\n* Tauros\n* Magikarp\n* Gyarados\n* Lapras\n* Ditto\n* Eevee\n* Vaporeon\n* Jolteon\n* Flareon\n* Porygon\n* Omanyte\n* Omastar\n* Kabuto\n* Kabutops\n* Aerodactyl\n* Snorlax\n* Articuno\n* Zapdos\n* Moltres\n* Dratini\n* Dragonair\n* Dragonite\n* Mewtwo\n* Mew\n* MissingNo.\n\n\n\nList of Pok\u00e9mon species introduced in Generation I (1996)[nb 1]\n| Name\n | National Pok\u00e9dexnumber\n | Type(s) | Evolves from\n | Evolves into\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese\n | Primary\n | Secondary\n |\n| Bulbasaur | *Fushigidane* (\u30d5\u30b7\u30ae\u30c0\u30cd) | 0001 | Grass\n | Poison | Beginning of evolution\n | Ivysaur (#002) | It uses the nutrients that are stored in the seed on its back in order to grow. The reception of Bulbasaur has been largely positive and it often appears in \"top Pok\u00e9mon lists\".[3][4] Its English name is a portmanteau of \"bulb\" and \"dinosaur\".[5] |\n| Ivysaur\n | *Fushigis\u014d* (\u30d5\u30b7\u30ae\u30bd\u30a6) | 0002 | Grass\n | Poison | Bulbasaur (#001) | Venusaur (#003) | When it is exposed to sunlight, the seed, now a bud, grows so much that it apparently loses the ability to stand on its hind legs. It grows by drawing in energy and when a wafting scent fills the area and it spends more time in the sun, it is ready to evolve. To support this weight, its legs grow thicker in size and strength. Once evolved, the seed grown flower on Ivysaur's back will bloom into a giant flower. Ivysaur is a playable character in *Super Smash Bros. Brawl* and *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate* as a part of the \"Pok\u00e9mon Trainer\" fighter. Its English name is a portmanteau of \"ivy\" and \"dinosaur\".[6] |\n| Venusaur\n | *Fushigibana* (\u30d5\u30b7\u30ae\u30d0\u30ca) | 0003 | Grass\n | Poison | Ivysaur (#002) | Mega EvolutionGigantamax | Its English name is a portmanteau of \"Venus\" (relating to the Venus flytrap) and \"dinosaur\". It is based on the *Pareiasaur*. It is the mascot of *Pok\u00e9mon Green* and *LeafGreen*.[7] It's always on the move to seek sunlight so it can absorb it for energy. When it does this, it tends to lay still. The aroma from the flower it now has on its back can soothe and calm people down. It's said that if a Venusaur gets enough sunlight, its flower will take on vivid colouration. As a result, it is way more powerful in the summer time. After a rainy day, its flower will smell stronger. The scent attracts other Pok\u00e9mon.\n |\n| Charmander | *Hitokage* (\u30d2\u30c8\u30ab\u30b2) | 0004 | Fire\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Charmeleon (#005) | Charmander is a bipedal, lizard-like Pok\u00e9mon with a flame at the tip of its tail. Its English name is a portmanteau of \"char\" and \"salamander\". Preferring hot places, there is a flame at the tip of is tail. Even newborns have a flame, though, unfamiliar with fire, they sometimes accidentally burn themselves. When it rains, you can see smoke coming from it, and it makes a sound too, though you'll have to be in a quiet place to hear it. The flame determines its vitality and emotions, the brighter it is, the healthier it is. Similarly when the flame is wavering, it is happy and when blazing, it is angry. If its flame were to ever go out, it would die.\n |\n| Charmeleon\n | *Riz\u0101do* (\u30ea\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9) | 0005 | Fire\n | Charmander (#004) | Charizard (#006) | Charmeleon is similar to Charmander, yet larger. Its English name is a portmanteau of \"char\" and \"chameleon\".[8] It's a very feisty Pok\u00e9mon, and fights can excite it, causing bluish white flames to spew. It swings its tail around causing unbearable temperatures. It also uses its razor sharp claws to attack as well. It constantly seeks tough opponents and it calms down only when it wins. In rocky mountains where they live, the night sky looks like stars due to their fiery tails.\n |\n| Charizard | *Riz\u0101don* (\u30ea\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u30f3) | 0006 | Fire\n | Flying\n | Charmeleon (#005) | Two Mega EvolutionsGigantamax | It is a playable character as a part of the \"Pok\u00e9mon Trainer\" fighter in *Super Smash Bros. Brawl* and *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate*, as well as a standalone fighter in *Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U*. It is also the mascot of *Pok\u00e9mon Red* and *FireRed*. Its fire is hot enough to melt boulders, and it has been known to start forest fires accidentally. When breathing fire which reaches great temperatures, it inflicts terrible pain on its foes, and the flame at the end of its tail burns more fiercely, though it will never use its fiery breath on foes weaker than itself. It will quickly melt glaciers weighing more than 10,000 tons. If it becomes furious, its flames become bluish-white, and its wings can let it soar up to 4,600 feet as it flies in search of stronger opponents. It's said that it fire burns hotter if it has experienced harsher battles. It gains the Dragon type upon Mega Evolving into Mega Charizard X. Its English name is a portmanteau of \"char\" and \"lizard\".\n |\n| Squirtle | *Zenigame* (\u30bc\u30cb\u30ac\u30e1) | 0007 | Water\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Wartortle (#008) | It is a playable character in *Super Smash Bros. Brawl* and *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate* as a part of the \"Pok\u00e9mon Trainer\" fighter. Its English name is a portmanteau of \"squirt\" and \"turtle\". It is one of the Kanto starter Pok\u00e9mon.[9] When born, its back swells into a shell which after some time will become resilient, and it takes time for the shell to harden. When it feels threatened, it tucks in its limbs and hides in its shell. Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection as the shell's rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minim water resistance, enabling this Pok\u00e9mon to swim at high speeds. It can spray a powerful foam from its mouth by retracting its long neck and vigorously shooting water out.\n |\n| Wartortle\n | *Kam\u0113ru* (\u30ab\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb) | 0008 | Water\n | Squirtle (#007) | Blastoise (#009) | Its English name is a portmanteau of \"wart\", \"tortoise\", and \"turtle\". It is a very common pet. It often hides underwater to stalk its prey, and when it is swimming really fast, it moves its fluffy ears to help it keep its balance. When tapped, it will pull in its head, but its tail will still stick out a little bit. The tail is covered with a rich fur, and as it ages, the fur will begin to darken in colour. It stores air in the fur before taking extended dives underwater. It's popular with elders because of its furry tail being known as a symbol of longevity, as it is said to live for 1,000 years. A shell covered in algae and scratches is proof of a Wartortle's age and fighting prowess. Wartortle was originally intended to have an entirely different final evolution that shared a closer design.\n |\n| Blastoise\n | *Kamekkusu* (\u30ab\u30e1\u30c3\u30af\u30b9) | 0009 | Water\n | Wartortle (#008) | Mega Evolution[10][11][12]Gigantamax | Its English name is a portmanteau of \"blast\" and \"tortoise\". It is the mascot of *Pok\u00e9mon Blue*.[13] In early stages of *Red* and *Green*'s development, Blastoise was originally separate from the Squirtle line and was called \"Caravaggio\". A Blastoise trading card, which was originally made as a test print before the commercial English cards, was sold for $360,000 in 2021.[14] The 2 cannons on its shell shoot out pressurised jets of water, able to shatter concrete and thick walls of steel with more force than a fire hose and they can be used in high speed tackles. This brutal Pok\u00e9mon deliberately makes itself heavy so it can withstand the recoil of the water jets it fires. The water spouts are very accurate as they can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet. It crushes its foe under its heavy body to cause fainting, and in a pinch, it will withdraw inside its shell.\n |\n| Caterpie\n | *Kyatap\u012b* (\u30ad\u30e3\u30bf\u30d4\u30fc) | 0010 | Bug\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Metapod (#011) | Its short feet are tipped with suction pads that enable it to tirelessly climb slopes and walls. To protect itself from bird-like Pok\u00e9mon, it will release a horrible stench from the antennae on its head if anything touches it and it has large eye-like patterns on its body used to scare away predators. It crawls into foliage where it camouflages itself among leaves that are the same colour as its body. Because it possibly wants to grow up quicker, Caterpie has a voracious appetite. It can devour hundreds of leaves bigger than its body. It is covered with a green skin, and when it grows, it sheds the skin, covers itself with silk, and becomes a cocoon. It's easy to catch, and grows quickly, making it one of the top recommendations for novice Pok\u00e9mon Trainers. Its body is soft and weak, and due to this, in nature, its perpetual fate is to be seen by others as food. Its appearance is based on the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail.\n |\n| Metapod\n | *Toranseru* (\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30bb\u30eb) | 0011 | Bug\n | Caterpie (#010) | Butterfree (#012) | The outer shell of Metapod is extremely hard, but the insides are soft due to the changes that it is undergoing. It may not move for more than two weeks. Ume Aoki, a Japanese cartoonist who is famous for her work on the manga *Hidamari Sketch* and the anime *Puella Magi Madoka Magica*, utils a likeness of herself cosplaying as a Metapod in her drawn works.[15] |\n| Butterfree\n | *Batafur\u012b* (\u30d0\u30bf\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc) | 0012 | Bug\n | Flying\n | Metapod (#011) | Gigantamax | It rubs honey onto the hairs on its legs to carry it back to its nest. In battle, it flaps its wings at great speed to release spores and powders onto opponents. Its Gigantamax form is a tremendous s with huge, turquoise wings and resembles Mothra of the Godzilla franchise. It sheds toxic flakes of crystallised Gigantamax energy.\n |\n| Weedle\n | *B\u012bdoru* (\u30d3\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb) | 0013 | Bug\n | Poison | Beginning of evolution\n | Kakuna (#014) | Its stinger is poisonous. While it does not like to fight, Weedle can protect itself, if only for a short while.\n |\n| Kakuna\n | *Kok\u016bn* (\u30b3\u30af\u30fc\u30f3) | 0014 | Bug\n | Poison | Weedle (#013) | Beedrill (#015) | Similar to Metapod, its shell is extremely hard, but the insides are soft due to its metamorphosis. Kakuna also doesn't move as much. Kakuna typically attach to trees in clusters and feel hot to the touch. Kakuna often group up in trees.\n |\n| Beedrill\n | *Supi\u0101* (\u30b9\u30d4\u30a2\u30fc) | 0015 | Bug\n | Poison | Kakuna (#014) | Mega Evolution | Beedrill are highly aggressive and will violently swarm and sting anyone who approaches their hive. Beedrill appear as large hornets with spikes on their forearms.\n |\n| Pidgey\n | *Poppo* (\u30dd\u30c3\u30dd) | 0016 | Normal\n | Flying\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Pidgeotto (#017) | Pidgey is the common bird of Kanto. It hunts bug Pok\u00e9mon until they scurry away. It is considered a counterpart and rival to Spearow.\n |\n| Pidgeotto\n | *Pijon* (\u30d4\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3) | 0017 | Normal\n | Flying\n | Pidgey (#016) | Pidgeot (#018) | Pidgeotto was the second Pok\u00e9mon that Ash Ketchum caught on his journey in the anime. It constantly flies around its large territory in search of prey and often squabbles with other Pidgeotto over territory.\n |\n| Pidgeot\n | *Pijotto* (\u30d4\u30b8\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8) | 0018 | Normal\n | Flying\n | Pidgeotto (#017) | Mega Evolution | Most trainers choose Pidgeot as their Pok\u00e9mon due to their striking, beautiful feathers. Pidgeot tend to be very large in size. Its highly decorated plumage is used to intimidate enemies. It races through the skies at Mach-2 speed.\n |\n| Rattata\n | *Koratta* (\u30b3\u30e9\u30c3\u30bf) | 0019 | Normal\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Raticate (#020) | Its teeth grow long over time, so it has to gnaw on logs, houses, telephone poles, and more, so it is often seen as a pest. Rattata has an Alolan form that is Dark/Normal-type.\n |\n| Raticate\n | *Ratta* (\u30e9\u30c3\u30bf) | 0020 | Normal\n | Rattata (#019) | End of evolution\n | Raticate commands groups of Rattata to gather food. Like Rattata, it has to whittle its teeth down, but as its teeth are much stronger, it requires harder objects such as steel and rocks. Like Rattata, Raticate has an Alolan form that is Dark/Normal-type.\n |\n| Spearow\n | *Onisuzume* (\u30aa\u30cb\u30b9\u30ba\u30e1) | 0021 | Normal\n | Flying\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Fearow (#022) | It eats bugs in grasslands and has to flap its short wings at high-speed to stay airborne. Spearow have short temperaments, and tend to swarm perceived enemies in large flocks. Ash Ketchum attempted to catch a Spearow without the help of his Pikachu, leading to a rather disastrous start of his journey.\n |\n| Fearow\n | *Onidoriru* (\u30aa\u30cb\u30c9\u30ea\u30eb) | 0022 | Normal\n | Flying\n | Spearow (#021) | End of evolution\n | Fearow is a lanky and awkward bird. Its English name is a portmanteau of \"fear\" and \"sparrow\". Fearow are large birds that can fly at extremely high altitudes for long periods of time.\n |\n| Ekans\n | *\u0100bo* (\u30a2\u30fc\u30dc) | 0023 | Poison | Beginning of evolution\n | Arbok (#024) | Its English name is \"snake\" spelled backwards.

It is also playable in every *Super Smash Bros.* game. Its Gigantamax form resembles its sprite from *Red* and *Blue* with a glowing, whitish tail. Pikachu raises its tail to check its surroundings and it might get struck by lightning in this pose. When groups gather and do this, the lightning shock would be very dangerous to be around. For this reason, the forests they inhabit away from cities are very dangerous to be in. Pikachu are adept at storing electricity and will discharge it at foes, recharge when sleeping. Pikachu with the stretchiest and softest cheeks are more powerful, but when their tail is yanked, they'll try and bite you. It'll intelligently roast berries to cook and eat them, and occasionally shock a fellow Pikachu that's a weakened state.

Some say building up electricity stresses it out. If its cheek pouches are empty, it'll raise its tail to gather electricity from the atmosphere. Its discharges reach 100,000 volts.

It appears as an armed rock.\n |\n| Graveler\n | *Gor\u014dn* (\u30b4\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3) | 0075 | Rock\n | Ground\n | Geodude (#074) | Golem (#076) | Graveler has an Alolan form that is Rock/Electric-type. It appears as a large rock that has two large arms and two small arms. This appearance suggests that the smaller arms are the old Geodude arms and the new ones emerged as it grew larger.\n |\n| Golem\n | *Gor\u014dnya* (\u30b4\u30ed\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3) | 0076 | Rock\n | Ground\n | Graveler (#075) | End of evolution\n | Golem is known for rolling down from mountains. To prevent them from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves have been dug into the sides of mountains to serve as guideways for diverting this Pok\u00e9mon's course. Golem has an Alolan form that is Rock/Electric-type. It appears as a large boulder that has a head, arms, and legs. It can roll up into a perfectly round rock. Its Alolan form is magnetic and has a rock cannon on its shoulders.\n |\n| Ponyta\n | *Pon\u012bta* (\u30dd\u30cb\u30fc\u30bf) | 0077 | Fire\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Rapidash (#078) | Its Galarian form is Psychic-type. When born, it cannot stand properly and runs with its parents to strengthen its legs. It can choose when its flames can burn people or not.\n |\n| Rapidash\n | *Gyaroppu* (\u30ae\u30e3\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7) | 0078 | Fire\n | Ponyta (#077) | End of evolution\n | As a popular Pok\u00e9mon, Rapidash is considered \"universally appealing\" to fans of cute and cool Pok\u00e9mon alike. Both Ponyta and Rapidash can enable their body's flames to be harmful or harmless as seen in the anime.[28][29][30][31] Its Galarian form is Psychic/Fairy-type, and is pinkish purple in colour instead. It just loves to run. It can't help itself when it see a car or anything fast. A very competitive Pok\u00e9mon, if it sees anything faster than it, it will go full speed in 10 steps to outrun it at 150\u00a0mph. At that point, its hooves barely touch the ground because it is moving so fast, it can traverse all of Hisui in a day and a half. The faster it goes, the longer its fiery mane becomes. Otherwise it can be seen cantering in fields.\n |\n| Slowpoke\n | *Yadon* (\u30e4\u30c9\u30f3) | 0079 | Water\n | Psychic\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Slowbro (#080)Slowking (#199) | It's really slow-witted, oblivious and likes to loll about. It takes 5 seconds for it to feel pain when attacked. Slowpoke uses its tail to catch prey by dipping it in water at the side of a river. However, this Pok\u00e9mon often forgets what it is doing and often spends entire days just loafing at water's edge. Even if its tail is bitten off, it won't feel it or notice. Although not nutritious, its tail is pleasant to chew on. When soaked in water, a sweet sap leaks from the tip of its tail. It can be added to stews for a nice flavor. Alolan homes often cook by simmering dried Slowpoke tails into a salty stew. Its tail naturally falls off, but regenerates quickly. There are some places where it is worshiped because of a long-standing belief that when a Slowpoke yawns, it rains. Its Galarian form is a Psychic-type. Trading Slowpoke while it holds a King's Rock evolves it into Slowking.\n |\n| Slowbro\n | *Yadoran* (\u30e4\u30c9\u30e9\u30f3) | 0080 | Water\n | Psychic\n | Slowpoke (#079) | Mega Evolution | Slowpoke has fished up a Shellder with its tail, which shocked it into evolving and made it stand on two legs. The Shellder apparently likes the taste of its tail so much it feels like it a dream, and now refuses to let go, which has metamorphosed into a spiral shaped shell. If the Shellder were to detach itself from Slowbro in any way, it will devolve back to Slowpoke. The Shellder is said to feed off of Slowbro's leftover scraps as it lives lazily by the sea. Being slow witted to begin with, it doesn't feel anything because of Shellder's seeping poison. Since its tail has been bitten by Shellder, it now has to grudgingly swim for prey instead. Whenever Shellder bites down on its tail, it gives Slowbro a flash of inspiration, which it forgets a moment later. Its Galarian form is a Poison/Psychic-type. In the Gold and Silver demo, the Shellder was its own Pok\u00e9mon, named Turban, before it was scrapped.\n |\n| Magnemite\n | *Koiru* (\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb) | 0081 | Electric\n | Steel[nb 4] | Beginning of evolution\n | Magneton (#082) | It was a pure Electric-type in Generation I, but had the Steel type added in Generation II. It tends to appear without warning and uses anti-gravity to float around. The two units on its side are like magnets and used for discharging attacks. It's attracted to electromagnetic waves from devices such as using the Pok\u00e9gear, and it attaches itself to power breakers. If you experience a power outage that isn't from a storm, it could be Magnemite feeding on it. It becomes incapable of flight if it out of electricity. When that happens, giving it a battery should help it out. The two magnets on its side are powerful enough to draw in iron objects from 300 feet away. The faster they rotate, the greater the magnetic field it generates. Touching it while it is eating electricity will give you a full body shock. Radio towers and power plants are great sources of food for them. Its numbers have been decreasing because most modern power lines are buried under the ground.\n |\n| Magneton\n | *Reakoiru* (\u30ec\u30a2\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb) | 0082 | Electric\n | Steel[nb 4] | Magnemite (#081) | Magnezone (#462) | Formed when several Magnemite fuse together, it tends to raise the temperature up by 3.6\u00a0\u00b0F within 3,600\u00a0ft. It generates strange radio signals and they tend to gather where sun flares happen. Earaches can occur if you get close to one. Its magnetism is so powerful it dries up moisture in its vicinity, and it is fatal to devices if it were to go near one as devices like TVs will stop playing correctly. When many Magneton gather, it disrupts radio signals. As a result, large cities have sirens to warn their citizens of this occurrence and some even warn people to keep it inside their Pok\u00e9balls. When it evolves, their brains link up too, though they don't become three times smarter. When rain clouds form, they like to gather in high spots where lightning could strike. Sandy Shocks appears to be an ancient relative of it. It evolves into Magnezone while in range of a special magnetic field or a Thunder Stone in later games.\n |\n| Farfetch'd\n | *Kamonegi* (\u30ab\u30e2\u30cd\u30ae) | 0083 | Normal\n | Flying\n | No evolution[nb 5] | Farfetch'd is a duck-like Pok\u00e9mon that carries around a green onion stalk much like a sword. It apparently knows where the best ones are and will battle over them. It will eat them in emergencies, and then run off to find a new one. They were so rare at one point that people bred them to regrow the population, and it worked. There are good stalks and bad stalks, and since it can't live without them, it will defend it with its life. It was originally called \"Okupan\" in early development and was intended to have an evolution named \"Madame\" in Generation II's early development. Its Galarian form is a Fighting-type, appears to resemble a feudal Japan-style samurai or ronin, and uses a larger onion-stalk. In Pok\u00e9mon Go, it is exclusive to certain regions of Asia.\n |\n| Doduo\n | *D\u014dd\u014d* (\u30c9\u30fc\u30c9\u30fc) | 0084 | Normal\n | Flying\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Dodrio (#085) | It leaves giant footprints. Its short wings make flying difficult. Instead, it runs at high speed on well-developed legs at over 60\u00a0mph. It races through grassy plains with powerful strides, leaving footprints up to four inches deep. By alternately raising and lowering its two heads, it balances itself to be more stable while running. Doduo's two heads never sleep or eat at the same time. Its two heads take turns to sleep or eat, so one head can always keep watch for enemies while the other one sleeps. Doduo's two heads contain completely identical brains. A scientific study reported that on rare occasions, there will be examples of Doduo possessing different sets of brains. The brains in its two heads appear to communicate emotions to each other with telepathic power. It was originally intended to have a pre-evolution in Generation II. It appears to resemble a two-headed ostrich or emu, mixed with a roadrunner.\n |\n| Dodrio\n | *D\u014ddorio* (\u30c9\u30fc\u30c9\u30ea\u30aa) | 0085 | Normal\n | Flying\n | Doduo (#084) | End of evolution\n | The three heads express joy, sorrow, and anger as they plan strategy together. When it sleeps, one head remains awake. Dodrio are extremely fast runners. The three heads have coloured feathers, which also appear as tail-feathers.\n |\n| Seel\n | *Pauwau* (\u30d1\u30a6\u30ef\u30a6) | 0086 | Water\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Dewgong (#087) | It loves swimming around in 14\u00a0\u00b0F waters. Its horn is really hard, and it uses it to bash its way through ice. It has a thick hide covered in warm fur. It even goes in waters that can be up to -40\u00a0\u00b0F. Though it is not a great walker, it is a skilled swimmer. It closes its nostrils when it swims and in the daytime, it can be found sleeping on the seabed of shallow waters. Therefore, them being in Alola is quite a mystery. Its design is based on the real-life seal.\n |\n| Dewgong\n | *Jugon* (\u30b8\u30e5\u30b4\u30f3) | 0087 | Water\n | Ice\n | Seel (#086) | End of evolution\n | A fisherman once saw a Dewgong on an iceberg and thought it was a mermaid. Its design is based on the real-life dugong.\n |\n| Grimer\n | *Betobet\u0101* (\u30d9\u30c8\u30d9\u30bf\u30fc) | 0088 | Poison | Beginning of evolution\n | Muk (#089) | It eats sewer waste for food. Its body is very slippery, so it can slip through almost any opening. It was one of the earliest Pok\u00e9mon to be created, and was originally supposed to have a pre-evolution, \"Betobebi\", in Generation II. Grimer has an Alolan form that is Poison/Dark-type. It appears as a purple sludge, while its Alolan form is multiple colours.\n |\n| Muk\n | *Betobeton* (\u30d9\u30c8\u30d9\u30c8\u30f3) | 0089 | Poison | Grimer (#088) | End of evolution\n | Muk's English name comes from the word \"muck\". It could be based on Dorotab\u014d, a one-eyed, three-fingered y\u014dkai that rises from the mud of neglected, overgrown rice fields. It's covered in a toxic filthy sludge that is so vile, that plants die wherever it walks due to there being poison it is footprints. Just a drop of its body fluid can turn a pool rancid or leave a person bed ridden for days from poisoning. Its nose has devolved, so it can't really smell anything. It feeds on anything repugnant and filthy, like sewer water. It prefers warm and humid environments. Its numbers have started declining since people have begun cleaning up towns, and because some people think it may go extinct, sludge pools are being built to prevent this. Muk has an Alolan form that is Poison/Dark-type. Like Grimer, Alolan Muk has multiple colours, and now bears razor-sharp poisonous crystal-esque teeth.\n |\n| Shellder\n | *Sherud\u0101* (\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc) | 0090 | Water\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Cloyster (#091) | When it sleeps, it will still stick its tongue out. It appears as a typical clam or bivalve with a long, pink tongue.\n |\n| Cloyster\n | *Parushen* (\u30d1\u30eb\u30b7\u30a7\u30f3) | 0091 | Water\n | Ice\n | Shellder (#090) | End of evolution\n | It swims by pushing water out through its valves. It is similar to Shellder, but rotated 180 degrees. Its body looks like a black ball inside a clam's shell. It has no tongue.\n |\n| Gastly\n | *G\u014dsu* (\u30b4\u30fc\u30b9) | 0092 | Ghost | Poison | Beginning of evolution\n | Haunter (#093) | It is a Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon based on the will-o'-the-wisp and the y\u014dkai, S\u014dgenbi. It hides under structures to stop the wind from blowing away its gaseous matter. Though it is part-Poison, it typically doesn't learn Poison-type moves naturally. It uses its signature tongue when it attacks with the *Lick* move.\n |\n| Haunter\n | *G\u014dsuto* (\u30b4\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8) | 0093 | Ghost | Poison | Gastly (#092) | Gengar (#094) | By licking, it saps the victim's life. It causes shaking that won't stop until the victim's demise. It appears as a shadow with a face and two unattached hands.\n |\n| Gengar\n | *Geng\u0101* (\u30b2\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc) | 0094 | Ghost | Poison | Haunter (#093) | Mega Evolution\nGigantamax Form\n | Gengar is a Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon that seeps into the shadows of people and Pok\u00e9mon to scare them for fun. The Leer in the darkness belongs to a Gengar. If you feel an attacking sudden chill of 10\u00a0\u00b0F cooler, it is trying to curse you. If it does this, there's no escape. Give up. Even your home isn't safe. Gengar will lurk in whatever dark corner of a room it can find and wait for its chance to catch its prey. It likes to attack people in the mountains. Sometimes, on a dark night, your shadow thrown by a streetlight will suddenly and startlingly overtake you. It's actually a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow. It often tries to steal the life force of people. It apparently wishes for a traveling companion. Since it was once human itself, it tries to create one by taking the lives of other humans. If your shadow begins to laugh, you must take hold of a protective charm immediately. Initially created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori,[32][33] it has become one of the most popular Pok\u00e9mon, placing tenth on the *Google Pok\u00e9mon of the Year 2020* poll.[34] *Kotaku'*s Zack Zwiezen said Gengar was \"one of [their] favourite gen 1 designs\", calling it a \"great design [because] it's simple, yet not boring or generic\".[35] Gengar has appeared in many Pok\u00e9mon spin-offs or crossovers, including *Pokk\u00e9n Tournament*[36] and *Pok\u00e9mon Unite*.[37] |\n| Onix\n | *Iw\u0101ku* (\u30a4\u30ef\u30fc\u30af) | 0095 | Rock\n | Ground\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Steelix (#208) | Onix is a large rock snake with a spike on its head. It usually lives underground. As it grows, the stone portions of its body harden to become similar to a diamond, but coloured black. It burrows at high speed in search of food, and the tunnels it leaves are used as homes by Diglett. Its large body is over 26 feet long, yet despite its size, it can squirm its way through the ground at 50\u00a0mph. The thunderous roar of its tunneling echoes a long way. As it digs through the ground, it absorbs many hard objects and this is what makes its body so solid. It even eats boulders while digging. Onix has a magnet in its brain. It acts as a compass so that this Pok\u00e9mon does not lose direction while it is tunneling. As it grows older, its body becomes increasingly rounder and smoother. It evolves into Steelix when traded while holding a Metal Coat.[1][38][39][40] |\n| Drowzee\n | *Sur\u012bpu* (\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d7) | 0096 | Psychic\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Hypno (#097) | Drowzee's design is based on the dream-eating tapir, Baku. It puts people to sleep and eats their dreams. It can get sick from eating bad ones though. If you sleep by it a lot, it might show you dreams it ate in the past. It is said to have descended from a legendary beast called Baku. If you had a dream but can't remember it, Drowzee probably ate it. It remembers every dream it ate and rarely eats the dreams of adults because children's are much tastier. If your nose gets itchy while you're sleeping, Drowzee is probably right above your bed eating your dream through your nostrils. It's skilled in hypnotism. It can tell what one is dreaming by smelling them. Drowzee appears as a half-yellow-half-brown Pok\u00e9mon that stands on two legs, and its size varies. In later s, it is given the Insomnia trait, making it immune to Sleep status inflicting moves.\n |\n| Hypno\n | *Sur\u012bp\u0101* (\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc) | 0097 | Psychic\n | Drowzee (#096) | End of evolution\n | Hypno's design is based on the dream-eating tapir, Baku and a hypnotist. It polishes its pendulum to more effectively put people to sleep. There is a myth within the franchise that Hypno preys on human children. This has led to Hypno becoming the subject of creepypastas.[*citation needed*] Hypno is purely yellow with a white fluffy collar mane.\n |\n| Krabby\n | *Kurabu* (\u30af\u30e9\u30d6) | 0098 | Water\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Kingler (#099) | As its name states, it is a crab Pok\u00e9mon that is half white/tan and half orange. In the anime, it doesn't speak its name like other Pok\u00e9mon and instead makes a unique noise.\n |\n| Kingler\n | *Kingur\u0101* (\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30fc) | 0099 | Water\n | Krabby (#098) | Gigantamax | Because its pincer is so heavy, it has a hard time fighting. When it does hit, it is very powerful. It shares a similarity to real life fiddler crabs. Its Gigantamax form is bigger with a beard made of bubbles. It also uses acid bubbles to dissolve its prey or foes.\n |\n| Voltorb\n | *Biriridama* (\u30d3\u30ea\u30ea\u30c0\u30de) | 0100 | Electric\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Electrode (#101) | Voltorb and Electrode are considered some of the least popular Pok\u00e9mon due to their Pok\u00e9ball-esque designs. Even the slightest bit of electricity can make an Electrode explode. That is why it is nicknamed the \"Bomb Ball\". In the video games, Voltorb and Electrode are typically used as landmine traps by villains. They have Hisuian forms that are Electric/Grass-type. This Voltorb evolves by Leaf Stone.\n |\n| Electrode\n | *Marumain* (\u30de\u30eb\u30de\u30a4\u30f3) | 0101 | Electric\n | Voltorb (#100) | End of evolution\n |\n| Exeggcute\n | *Tamatama* (\u30bf\u30de\u30bf\u30de) | 0102 | Grass\n | Psychic\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Exeggutor (#103) | Six of them together form a full-fledged Pok\u00e9mon. It is often hunted by Crabrawler, but uses psychokinesis to drive it off. Despite technically being several different lifeforms, they are never seen alone. There is also one that appears to be broken with yolk visible. It evolves into Exeggutor using a Leaf Stone. Despite the name, they are actually seeds.\n |\n| Exeggutor\n | *Nassh\u012b* (\u30ca\u30c3\u30b7\u30fc) | 0103 | Grass\n | Psychic\n | Exeggcute (#102) | End of evolution\n | It is a coconut tree-esque Pok\u00e9mon based on the Jinmenju and the favourite Pok\u00e9mon of Tsunekazu Ishihara, president and CEO of The Pok\u00e9mon Company, having used it throughout the debugging phase of *Pok\u00e9mon Red* and *Green*. Its 3 heads think independently of one another, but if they want to go in different directions, they'll be unable to move. For this reason, they use telepathy to make a joint decision. Sometimes, one of the heads grows so big that it falls off and becomes an Exeggcute. Its cries are very noisy because each head thinks about what it likes. Surprisingly, they are very friendly and only engage their enemies with psychic power when needed. It originally came from the tropics, so it is known as the \"Walking Forest\" and each head doesn't seem to be interested in one another. Cloudy days make it sluggish. Exeggutor has an Alolan form that is Grass/Dragon-type and has a much longer trunk-esque neck.\n |\n| Cubone\n | *Karakara* (\u30ab\u30e9\u30ab\u30e9) | 0104 | Ground\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Marowak (#105) | Because it never removes its skull helmet, no one has ever seen this Pok\u00e9mon's real face. It wears the skull of its deceased mother. If it is sad or lonely, its skull shakes and its cries echo inside the skull and come out as a sad melody. It cries mournfully in the moonlight. Cubone pines for the mother it will never see again. The stains on the skull the Pok\u00e9mon wears are made by the tears it sheds. Mandibuzz are its natural predators, amd will attack it from the air when hearing its cries. According to some, it will evolve when it comes to terms with the pain of her death. Sometimes, Cubone's dreams make it cry, but each tear Cubone sheds makes it stronger.\n |\n| Marowak\n | *Garagara* (\u30ac\u30e9\u30ac\u30e9) | 0105 | Ground\n | Cubone (#104) | End of evolution\n | Marowak appears as an older Cubone with the skull becoming the head. It wields a bone that it uses as a boomerang, and is thus the only Pok\u00e9mon that can use Bonemerang. It also has an Alolan form that is Ghost/Fire-type that uses its mother's spirit as a flame at the end of its bones.\n |\n| Hitmonlee\n | *Sawamur\u0101* (\u30b5\u30ef\u30e0\u30e9\u30fc) | 0106 | Fighting | Tyrogue (#236) | End of evolution\n | Hitmonlee's design is based on Headless men, from Greco-Roman mythology. It may also be based on Kabandha, a demon from Hindu mythology. Its English name is derived from actor and martial artist Bruce Lee. When it is in a hurry, its legs strengthen progressively. It smoothly runs with extra long strides. When kicking, the soles of its feet turn as hard as diamond as its legs freely stretch to destroy its foes. It has amazing balance, able to attack from any stance. Some people call it the \"Kicking Master.\" After a battle, it rubs down its springy legs to overcome fatigue. Its legs can stretch to double its length, so first time fighters are amazed by its extendable reach. Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan didn't have a distinct evolutionary line until Tyrogue and Hitmontop were conceived. Hitmonlee evolves from Tyrogue if it has higher attack stats.\n |\n| Hitmonchan\n | *Ebiwar\u0101* (\u30a8\u30d3\u30ef\u30e9\u30fc) | 0107 | Fighting | Tyrogue (#236) | End of evolution\n | Its English name is derived from actor and martial artist Jackie Chan. Its punches are faster than the eye can see, to the point of being able to slice through hair, though it needs to rest for a couple minutes after doing so as it moves around. It winds it arms to punch harder and punches in a corkscrew fashion, with enough strength to break through concrete walls like a drill. Even a slight graze can cause a burn. A Hitmonchan is said to possess the spirit of a boxer who had been working towards a world championship. It has an indomitable spirit and will never give up when things get tough. It evolves from Tyrogue if it has higher defense stats.\n |\n| Lickitung\n | *Beroringa* (\u30d9\u30ed\u30ea\u30f3\u30ac) | 0108 | Normal\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Lickilicky (#463) | Instead of its hands, it uses its adept long tongue. It uses its tongue to paralyze bug Pok\u00e9mon to eat them whole. If it licks you, it will leave a tingling sensation. If you don't wash it off immediately, it will break out into an itchy rash that won't go away. Its tongue can stretch up to 6'6 and when it does, its tail quivers and contracts. It has nerves that run through its tongue so it can use it quite freely. It licks filthy things clean but whatever it clean always stinks afterwards so it is really questionable whether or not it is truly clean. Whenever Lickitung cones across something new, it always gives it a lick to memorize the taste and texture of that thing. It doesn't care for sour things. If you boil its viscous saliva down, it becomes quite a strong adhesive. It evolves into Lickilicky while knowing Rollout.\n |\n| Koffing\n | *Dog\u0101su* (\u30c9\u30ac\u30fc\u30b9) | 0109 | Poison | Beginning of evolution\n | Weezing (#110) | Koffing is based on air pollution and meteorites. Sometimes, it can over-inflate itself and explode. It appears as a floating space-rock with several gas vent holes that expel its fumes. It also has a skull and crossbones style marking on its chest. Koffing was Team Rocket member James' starting Pok\u00e9mon.\n |\n| Weezing\n | *Matadogasu* (\u30de\u30bf\u30c9\u30ac\u30b9) | 0110 | Poison | Koffing (#109) | End of evolution\n | Weezing belonged to James of Team Rocket in the Kanto and Johto series of the Pok\u00e9mon anime and for a small portion of the Advanced Generation series. It likes to raid trash can for food. To make its poison more toxic, it pushes its gas through its two heads. Its Galarian form is Poison/Fairy-type. It appears as three different sised Koffing rocks merged, with faces on the two bigger ones.\n |\n| Rhyhorn\n | *Saih\u014dn* (\u30b5\u30a4\u30db\u30fc\u30f3) | 0111 | Ground\n | Rock\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Rhydon (#112) | Its tackles can demolish skyscrapers, but its memory isn't the best. Once it starts going, it sometimes cannot remember why it started. It appears as a rhinoceros-like creature made of diamond-hard rock.\n |\n| Rhydon\n | *Saidon* (\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9\u30f3) | 0112 | Ground\n | Rock\n | Rhyhorn (#111) | Rhyperior (#464) | Rhydon was the first Pok\u00e9mon created by Game Freak.[41] Its hide is very tough. Unlike Rhyhorn, it is bipedal.

In generation I, Chansey was a stand-alone Pok\u00e9mon. It appears as a pink oblong shaped creature with stubby arms and feet. It carries eggs in its pouch and is typically used by Pok\u00e9mon Centres for the egg's healing properties.\n |\n| Tangela\n | *Monjara* (\u30e2\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30e9) | 0114 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Tangrowth (#465) | Blue plant vines cloak the Pok\u00e9mon's identity in a tangled mass. It entangles anything that gets close. It also resembles the severed head of the gorgon, Medusa. It gained an evolution, Tangrowth, in Generation IV, and was going to have a pre-evolution in Generation II.[*citation needed*] |\n| Kangaskhan\n | *Gar\u016bra* (\u30ac\u30eb\u30fc\u30e9) | 0115 | Normal\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Mega Evolution | Kangaskhan in *Pok\u00e9mon Go* is exclusively available to Australia. It was the second Pok\u00e9mon created by Game Freak, after Rhydon.[*citation needed*] It carries a baby Kangaskhan in its pouch until it grows up. In the anime series, they live in groups. Upon Mega Evolution, the baby grows and fights with its mother, though it still worries for its child.\n |\n| Horsea\n | *Tatts\u016b* (\u30bf\u30c3\u30c4\u30fc) | 0116 | Water\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Seadra (#117) | Horsea and Seadra are based on seahorses.[42] In the occurrence of a big wave, Horsea will curl its tail around tough coral branches to help it not to be washed away. Horsea evolves into Seadra, which appears as a slightly bigger version of it. The spikes on its body are poisonous. It evolves into Kingdra when traded while holding a Dragon Scale. Seadra is a clever Pok\u00e9mon that is capable of swimming backwards by rapidly flapping its wing-like pectoral fins and stout tail. Touching the back fin causes numbness, and it hooks its tail to coral to stay in place while sleeping. Fainting may result from a jab of its sharp spikes. When an examination of its cells revealed the presence of a gene not found in Horsea, it immediately became a hot topic. Its fin tips leak poison, and its fins and bones are highly valued as ingredients in herbal medicine. Seadra sleeps after wriggling itself between the branches of coral and those trying to harvest coral are occasionally stung by this Pok\u00e9mon's poison barbs if they fail to notice it. Seadra generates whirlpools by spinning its body, and the whirlpools are strong enough to swallow even fishing boats. It weakens prey with these currents, then swallows it whole, and while Seadra's mouth is slender, its suction power is strong. In an instant, it can suck in food that's larger than the opening of its mouth. The males raise the offspring. While Seadra are raising young Horsea, the spines on their backs secrete thicker and stronger poison.\n |\n| Seadra\n | *Sh\u012bdora* (\u30b7\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9) | 0117 | Water\n | Horsea (#116) | Kingdra (#230) |\n| Goldeen\n | *Tosakinto* (\u30c8\u30b5\u30ad\u30f3\u30c8) | 0118 | Water\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Seaking (#119) | Goldeen and Seaking are based on goldfish.[42] Goldeen was originally intended to have a pre-evolution called \"Gyopin\".

It gains the Flying type upon Mega Evolution.\n |\n| Tauros\n | *Kentarosu* (\u30b1\u30f3\u30bf\u30ed\u30b9) | 0128 | Normal\n | No evolution\n | When attacking, it violently charges while whipping itself with its three tails. A really rowdy and hyper Pok\u00e9mon, once it charges, it won't stop until it hits something. Although powerful, it can only charge in a straight line. They fight each other by locking horns to prove their strength, and the leader prides itself with its battle-scarred horns. If there are no opponents, it will charge into thick trees, knocking them down. Historically, people have ridden Tauros for ages, but the practice started in Alola, and Tauros in Alola actually have a calm side, most likely due to the climate. Tauros in Galar though are more volatile and won't let people ride on them. In Paldea, it has 3 other forms, with it now being a Fighting-type along with a Fighting/Fire and a Fighting/Water-type. It is exclusive to North America in Pok\u00e9mon Go.\n |\n| Magikarp | *Koikingu* (\u30b3\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0) | 0129 | Water\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Gyarados (#130) | Magikarp holds the distinction of being mostly useless in the games, until it evolves into the superior Gyarados.

Its vicious and raging attitude can decimate cities. It originally had a completely different, more lamprey-esque design in *Red* and *Green*'s early development. It is known to be a hard Pok\u00e9mon to raise by inexperienced trainers. The shiny version is red, and plays a role in the series. It appears normally as a long blue sea dragon, despite not being Dragon-type. It is also the only Flying-type that doesn't fly; instead of this, it can hover.\n |\n| Lapras | *Rapurasu* (\u30e9\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9) | 0131 | Water\n | Ice\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Gigantamax | It has a very gentle nature and was hunted before it became illegal.

It was originally intended to have an evolution in Generation II called \"Animon\" which would have evolved from a Metal Coat. Fan speculation is that Ditto and Mew are related as Mew can also use Transform, a move exclusive to Ditto.[*citation needed*] In the anime, Ditto belonging to Duplica had an issue with accurately mimicking appearances where its face always looked like Ditto's own. It appears as a pink blob or amoeba.\n |\n| Eevee | *\u012abui* (\u30a4\u30fc\u30d6\u30a4) | 0133 | Normal\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Multiple[nb 7]Gigantamax | Eevee is often considered among the \"cutest\" Pok\u00e9mon in the franchise.[56][57][58][59] Due to this, Eevee is featured on various *Pok\u00e9mon*-related merchandise.[60][61][62] It is the mascot of *Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Eevee!* Eevee has exclusive evolution styles, where each evolution requires special requirements to occur, resulting in 8 different Pok\u00e9mon. Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in cities and towns. However, it is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment or though the radiation of certain stones. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving into eight different evolutions. Some call it and its evolutions the \"Eeveelutions\". Eevee can also adapt the face of the Trainer that owns it, and Eevee's genes are believed to have the key to solving the mysteries of Pok\u00e9mon evolution. Its Gigantamax form is bigger and has a thicker fur around his neck.\n |\n| Vaporeon\n | *Shaw\u0101zu* (\u30b7\u30e3\u30ef\u30fc\u30ba) | 0134 | Water\n | Eevee (#133) | End of Evolution\n | Its genes are similar to that of water, so it seems to melt away while submerged. If its fins begin to mutate, it means it'll rain in a couple of hours. It now has the ability to freely control water, and its tail has gotten gotten it mistaken for a mermaid. It evolves from Eevee using a Water Stone.[63] Vaporeon became the ambassador for Water Day in Japan in 2023.[64] |\n| Jolteon\n | *Sand\u0101su* (\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9) | 0135 | Electric\n | Eevee (#133) | End of evolution\n | Jolteon and Zapdos's romanised Japanese names are almost exactly the same as each other's, with a final 's' being the only difference. It accumulates negative ions in the air to dish out 10,000 volt discharges. It is a moody Pok\u00e9mon, easily becoming sad or angry. Its spiky fur can be launched to pierce enemies when it bristles.

It can enter cyberspace at will. People theorised it could go into space, though no one has managed to do so. It has no heartbeat and doesn't need to eat, though it can eat if food is given. Because of this, people are eager to try it in any environment. It's copy-protected so it cannot be duplicated. Using the most advanced technology at the time, scientists have made the first manmade Pok\u00e9mon, dreaming of exploring space. Nowadays, it is actually very useful in cyberspace, as it goes around making sure no suspicious data exists. It is one of many human-designed Pok\u00e9mon. It gained an evolution in generation II, Porygon2.\n |\n| Omanyte\n | *Omunaito* (\u30aa\u30e0\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8) | 0138 | Rock\n | Water\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Omastar (#139) | It is a fossil Pok\u00e9mon that must be revived from the helix fossil that is based on ammonites.\n |\n| Omastar\n | *Omusut\u0101* (\u30aa\u30e0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc) | 0139 | Rock\n | Water\n | Omanyte (#138) | End of evolution\n | Omastar is very popular in the community and commonly referred to as \"Lord Helix\".

It went extinct, but it was resurrected by taking its DNA from an Old Amber. It appears to be able to fly by spreading its wings and gliding fearlessly though the skies as if it was its own. It was imagined to be the king of the skies. A widely accepted theory is that it went extinct due to a meteor impact. It exhibited ferocity that was greater than expected, resulting in some casualties. When it touched ground however, it was weak and slow. Surprisingly, even modern technology is still unable to make a truly perfect specimen. It is based on pterodactyls and dragons/wyverns.\n |\n| Snorlax | *Kabigon* (\u30ab\u30d3\u30b4\u30f3) | 0143 | Normal\n | Munchlax (#446) | Gigantamax | It is carefree about everything, and it will allow children to play on its vast belly while it sleeps all day.

Melee*, *Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U* and *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate*. This Legendary Pok\u00e9mon was created in a lab after years of gene splicing from Mew's DNA. Its DNA is actually almost the same as Mew's, but its body is size are vastly different. Its cold, glowing eyes strike fear into its foes. Because its psychic abilities were raised to the ultimate level, it only thinks about defeating its enemies as it rests in an undiscovered cave. But even though it has a powerful body, scientists failed to give it a compassionate heart and it turned vicious as a result. It rests to conserve energy, so that it can unleash its full power in battle. The research efforts of Dr. Fuji led him to create Mewtwo. It also appears in several movies.\n |\n| Mew | *My\u016b* (\u30df\u30e5\u30a6) | 0151 | Psychic\n | No evolution\n | This Mythical Pok\u00e9mon is so rare, only a few experts worldwide have found it, though a growing number of people have reportedly seen it recently. It apparently originates in South America. It's said that it appears only to those who have a true heart and a strong passion to see it. Its DNA is said to contain the genetic code of every Pok\u00e9mon and every move. Because of this, many scientists believe that it is the ancestor of all Pok\u00e9mon. If you view its body under a microscope, you can see its fine, small and delicate hairs. It is capable of turning invisible at will so that people are unaware of its presence. It is considered one of the original pregenetor Pok\u00e9mon, as all Pok\u00e9mon descend from Mew. It fought Mewtwo during the Pok\u00e9mon movies.\n |\n| MissingNo. | *Ketsuban* (\u3051\u3064\u3070\u3093) | None[nb 8] | Bird[nb 9] | Normal\n | No evolution\n | An error handler species, \"Missing Number\" was created to handle attempts at accessing nonexistent Pok\u00e9mon species.[66][67] It is regarded as one of the most famous and popular glitches in video game history.[68] |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Details on Pok\u00e9mon names, National Pok\u00e9dex numbers, types and evolutions are obtained from The Pok\u00e9mon Company International's online Pok\u00e9dex.[2]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Prior to *X* and *Y*, Clefairy, Clefable, Jigglypuff, and Wigglytuff were pure Normal types while Mr. Mime was pure Psychic.\n3. **^** Galarian Meowth (introduced in *Pok\u00e9mon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Perrserker.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Prior to *Gold* and *Silver*, Magnemite and Magneton were pure Electric types.\n5. **^** Only Galarian Farfetch'd (introduced in *Pok\u00e9mon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Sirfetch'd.\n6. **^** Only Galarian Mr. Mime (introduced in *Pok\u00e9mon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Mr. Rime.\n7. **^** Eevee is capable of evolving into Vaporeon (#134), Jolteon (#135), Flareon (#136), Espeon (#196), Umbreon (#197), Leafeon (#470), Glaceon (#471) or Sylveon (#700).\n8. **^** MissingNo. is programmed with the Kanto Pok\u00e9dex number \"000\", however it does not exist in the National Pok\u00e9dex.\n9. **^** Bird type was a scrapped type for Generations I and II; however, code for it remains in the games.

Some Pok\u00e9mon in this generation were introduced in animated adaptations of the franchise before *Gold* and *Silver*, such as Ho-Oh in the first episode of the *Pok\u00e9mon* anime series in 1998 and 1999, Togepi, which was a recurring character in the anime owned by Misty, Donphan in the Pok\u00e9mon first movie in 1998, Snubbull in the first Pikachu short movie in 1998, and Marill, which also debuted in that short film and was a recurring character in the anime owned by Tracey Sketchit in 1998 and 1999. Elekid, Bellossom, Ledyba, and Hoothoot debuted in Pikachu's Rescue Adventure and Lugia and Slowking debuted in Pok\u00e9mon 2000.\n\n\nThe following list details the 100\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon of Generation\u00a0II in order of their National Pok\u00e9dex number. The first Pok\u00e9mon, Chikorita, is number 152 and the last, Celebi, is number 251. Alternate forms that result in type changes are included for convenience. Mega evolutions and regional forms are included on the pages for the generation in which they were introduced.\n\n\n\n\n## Table of Dexes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Dex name | No. of Pokemon in Dex | No. in National Dex | percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Johto Dex [Gold, Silver and Crystal]\n | 251\n | 251\n | 100%  100%\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n |\n\n\n## Design and development[edit]\n\n\nTwo new types were introduced in *Pok\u00e9mon Gold* and *Silver* \u2013 namely the \"Dark\" and \"Steel\" types \u2013 which were intended to better balance the gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon battles. Dark and Steel types fare well against \"Psychic\" attacks, which was a dominant type in *Red* and *Blue*. The concept of breeding was introduced in the second generation of *Pok\u00e9mon* games as well, which allows players to manipulate the skills of their Pok\u00e9mon to a greater degree.[1] Some of the new Pok\u00e9mon introduced in *Gold* and *Silver* are pre-evolutions of other Pok\u00e9mon, such as Pichu and Igglybuff. These baby Pok\u00e9mon are only available by breeding their evolved forms.\n\n\n*Pok\u00e9mon Gold* and *Silver* were first revealed at Nintendo Space World in 1997. At this point, the game had a massively larger world map than the final game and this prototype featured around 40 Pok\u00e9mon designs that were removed and replaced when the games were released in 1999.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## List of Pok\u00e9mon[edit]\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n* Chikorita\n* Bayleef\n* Meganium\n* Cyndaquil\n* Quilava\n* Typhlosion\n* Totodile\n* Croconaw\n* Feraligatr\n* Sentret\n* Furret\n* Hoothoot\n* Noctowl\n* Ledyba\n* Ledian\n* Spinarak\n* Ariados\n* Crobat\n* Chinchou\n* Lanturn\n* Pichu\n* Cleffa\n* Igglybuff\n* Togepi\n* Togetic\n* Natu\n* Xatu\n* Mareep\n* Flaaffy\n* Ampharos\n* Bellossom\n* Marill\n* Azumarill\n* Sudowoodo\n* Politoed\n* Hoppip\n* Skiploom\n* Jumpluff\n* Aipom\n* Sunkern\n* Sunflora\n* Yanma\n* Wooper\n* Quagsire\n* Espeon\n* Umbreon\n* Murkrow\n* Slowking\n* Misdreavus\n* Unown\n* Wobbuffet\n* Girafarig\n* Pineco\n* Forretress\n* Dunsparce\n* Gligar\n* Steelix\n* Snubbull\n* Granbull\n* Qwilfish\n* Scizor\n* Shuckle\n* Heracross\n* Sneasel\n* Teddiursa\n* Ursaring\n* Slugma\n* Magcargo\n* Swinub\n* Piloswine\n* Corsola\n* Remoraid\n* Octillery\n* Delibird\n* Mantine\n* Skarmory\n* Houndour\n* Houndoom\n* Kingdra\n* Phanpy\n* Donphan\n* Porygon2\n* Stantler\n* Smeargle\n* Tyrogue\n* Hitmontop\n* Smoochum\n* Elekid\n* Magby\n* Miltank\n* Blissey\n* Raikou\n* Entei\n* Suicune\n* Larvitar\n* Pupitar\n* Tyranitar\n* Lugia\n* Ho-Oh\n* Celebi\n\n\n\nList of Pok\u00e9mon species introduced in Generation II (1999)[nb 1]\n| Name\n | National Pok\u00e9dexnumber\n | Type(s) | Evolves from\n | Evolves into\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese\n | Primary\n | Secondary\n |\n| Chikorita\n | *Chikorita* (\u30c1\u30b3\u30ea\u30fc\u30bf)[4] | 0152 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Bayleef (#153) | A small quadrupedal green Pok\u00e9mon with a large lime green leaf on its head.

It also resembles a pear\n |\n| Bayleef\n | *Bayleef* (\u30d9\u30a4\u30ea\u30fc\u30d5)[5] | 0153 | Grass\n | Chikorita (#152) | Meganium (#154) | While Chikorita's and Meganium's designs were settled in 1997, Bayleef originally had a significantly different design.[6] The leaves around its neck hold a small shoot of a tree and they make people peppy. Ash Ketchum has a Bayleef in the anime.\n |\n| Meganium\n | *Meganium* (\u30e1\u30ac\u30cb\u30a6\u30e0)[7] | 0154 | Grass\n | Bayleef (#153) | End of evolution\n | It is based on the *Sauropod*. Meganium has the power to revive dead plants with its breath. It has a wafting aroma that soothes anyone around it, and this is because its petals contain a substance that calms aggressive feelings.

Anyone who stands beside it becomes refreshed, just as if they were relaxing in a sunny forest.\n |\n| Cyndaquil\n | *Hinoarashi* (\u30d2\u30ce\u30a2\u30e9\u30b7)[8] | 0155 | Fire\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Quilava (#156) | Cyndaquil is timid and shy.

It may think that it is playing with its Trainer, but if not careful, can cause very serious injuries. Ash has a Totodile in the Pok\u00e9mon anime that sounds like Donald Duck.\n |\n| Croconaw\n | *Arigeitsu* (\u30a2\u30ea\u30b2\u30a4\u30c4)[9] | 0159 | Water\n | Totodile (#158) | Feraligatr (#160) | If it bites something, it will not let go due to its teeth being similar to barbed backfish hooks, making them almost impossible to remove.\n |\n| Feraligatr\n | *\u014cdairu* (\u30aa\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30eb)[7] | 0160 | Water\n | Croconaw (#159) | End of evolution\n | It intimidates its foes by opening its huge mouth. When battling, it will stomp the ground hard with its strong legs and rush at the enemy. This evolutionary line is based on crocodiles and alligators.\n |\n| Sentret\n | *Otachi* (\u30aa\u30bf\u30c1)[12] | 0161 | Normal\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Furret (#162) | When one sleeps, another scouts. If danger arrives, it wakes the others and flees. A single Sentret cannot sleep out of fear when it is separated from the rest. Sentrets stand on their tails to look for danger.\n |\n| Furret\n | *\u014ctachi* (\u30aa\u30aa\u30bf\u30c1)[13] | 0162 | Normal\n | Sentret (#161) | End of evolution\n | Furret are nimble, quick, and known for slipping through small spaces due to its small size and nimble feet. It is hard to tell where the front ends and the bottom begins. It is based on the real-life ferret.\n |\n| Hoothoot\n | *H\u014dh\u014d* (\u30db\u30fc\u30db\u30fc)[13] | 0163 | Normal\n | Flying\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Noctowl (#164) | Hoothoot will always hoot at the same time everyday due to its internal organ that can sense the Earth's rotation. Hoothoots have two legs but are almost always seen standing on one. They switch out which legs they stand on faster than the eye can process it. It debuted first in the *Pikachu's Rescue Adventure* short before the second movie.\n |\n| Noctowl\n | *Yorunozuku* (\u30e8\u30eb\u30ce\u30ba\u30af)[13] | 0164 | Normal\n | Flying\n | Hoothoot (#163) | End of evolution\n | It will never fail to catch its prey at night due to its soft and quiet wings, and its impeccable night vision. Its English name is a portmanteau of \"nocturnal\" and \"owl\". Ash has a shiny Noctowl in the anime.\n |\n| Ledyba\n | *Ledyba* (\u30ec\u30c7\u30a3\u30d0)[13] | 0165 | Bug\n | Flying\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Ledian (#166) | It communicates to other Ledyba by secreting fluids where its legs meet its body.

A single strand of a special string is endlessly spun out of its rear. The string leads back to its nest. Rather than making a nest in one specific spot, it wanders in search of food after darkness falls. Every night, it wanders around in search of prey, whose movements it restrains by spewing threads before it bites into them with its fangs. Its feet are tipped with tiny hooked claws that enable it to scuttle on ceilings and vertical walls and it constricts the foe with thin and strong silk webbing. It attaches silk to its prey and sets it free. Later, it tracks the silk to the prey and its friends. There are some areas where people use the string Ariados spins for their own weaving. The resulting cloth is popular for its strength. When feeding, it wraps its prey up in thread and sips their bodily fluids at its leisure.\n |\n| Crobat\n | *Crobat* (\u30af\u30ed\u30d0\u30c3\u30c8)[14] | 0169 | Poison | Flying\n | Golbat (#042) | End of evolution\n | It is the final evolution of Zubat and Golbat. Crobat can fly long distances. It usually flies with all four wingsbut, it can alternate what pairs of wings it flies with. Golbat evolves into Crobat when it has high-enough friendship levels.

It also communicates to others by flashing its lights at them. Lanturn is called \"The Deep Sea Star\" because of its antenna. It can illuminate its light by causing chemical reactions between bacteria and its body fluids.

Ursaring's hunger during this time makes it a ferocious Pok\u00e9mon. It usually wears a hardened expression, but when it is licking up honey, which it loves, the joy it feels will cause it to break into a wide grin. If it comes across a Primeape while searching for berries, a fierce fight will begin. Its name is based on the Ursa constellation, and the typical scientific name for bears. In *Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus* it can evolve into Ursaluna by giving it a peat block during a full moon.\n |\n| Slugma\n | *Magumaggu* (\u30de\u30b0\u30de\u30c3\u30b0)[13] | 0218 | Fire\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Magcargo (#219) | Lava circulates inside of its body instead of blood.

Those who stare at them will feel like they are gradually being unable to stand up. The round balls at the base of its antlers can be grounded up to aid in sleeping medicine. Its antlers were trading for high prices, and so it was hunted close to extinction. Some say that it was stronger in ancient times, where it lived in harsher climates and had lots of enemies and could evolve under own power. It also could wield psychic power a lot better than it does now too. Stantlers are based on various deer species, as well as the shishi-odoshi.

It is famous for fighting bigger foes and tending to its injuries. It evolves into Hitmonlee at high attack stats, Hitmonchan with high defence stats, and Hitmontop with equal attack and defence stats.\n |\n| Hitmontop\n | *Kapoer\u0101* (\u30ab\u30dd\u30a8\u30e9\u30fc)[22] | 0237 | Fighting | Tyrogue (#236) | End of evolution\n | Its elegant dance-like fighting style could get you drilled hard if you are not careful. If it launches kicks while spinning, it can essentially drill its way into the ground. It gets around faster while spinning rather than walking, which can be used both for offense and defense.

It is the master of the Legendary Bird trio. It debuted in the second movie, where it spoke and was one of the heroes. Lugia was originally conceived by Takeshi Shudo, the head writer of the first *Pok\u00e9mon* anime. Lugia had been designed solely for *Pok\u00e9mon The Movie 2000*, and Shudo expressed surprise that the creature was later featured in the video games and TV show.[41] Lugia, who possessed a speaking role in the film, was given a masculine voice. However, Shudo intended Lugia as a creature that was simultaneously male and female. This dual nature was intended to embody one of the film's main messages, that people can be different and yet coexist without resorting to conflict. He showed \"overwhelming regret that he allowed Lugia to be voiced by a man\", considering Lugia, the \"creator of all life on Earth\", to be a \"maternal Pok\u00e9mon\". Stating that \"it was too late, we couldn't suddenly change Lugia into a female\", the change was so significant to him that it made him start \"gulping down alcohol and drugs\" and \"feel like [he] wanted to die\". During the final few years of his life, Shudo became \"obsessed\" with Lugia, writing numerous blog posts on the subject.[41][*unreliable source?*] |\n| Ho-Oh\n | *Ho-Oh* (\u30db\u30a6\u30aa\u30a6)[7] | 0250 | Fire\n | Flying\n | No evolution\n | Similar to Moltres, Ho-Oh's design is inspired by the Fenghuang (firebird) of Chinese myth.[35] It is the master of the Legendary Beast trio and the one who resurrected them.

It was only available via special distribution events, and it was one of the heroes in *Pok\u00e9mon 4Ever*. It has been regarded as one of the best Pokemon by multiple websites, including *The Escapist*, *IGN*, *GamesRadar+*, and authors Tracey West and Katherine Noll.[43][44][45][46] *Variety* editor Robert Koehler identified Celebi as a Pokemon that appeals to young girls.[47] |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Details on Pok\u00e9mon names, National Pok\u00e9dex numbers, types and evolutions are obtained from The Pok\u00e9mon Company International's online Pok\u00e9dex.[3]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Prior to *X* and *Y*, Cleffa, Igglybuff, Togepi, Snubbull and Granbull were pure Normal types, while Togetic was Normal/Flying.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Starting in *X* and *Y*, Marill and Azumarill gained the Fairy type.\n4. **^** Paldean Wooper (introduced in *Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet* and *Violet*) are capable of evolving into Clodsire.\n5. **^** Only Galarian Corsola (introduced in *Pok\u00e9mon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Cursola.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Beckett, Michael. \"Pokemon Gold/Silver \u2013 Staff Retroview\". *RPGamer*.

These games were accompanied by the television series Pok\u00e9mon Advanced, which aired from November 1, 2002, until August 28, 2003 in Japan.\n\n\nThe following list details the 135\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon of Generation\u00a0III in order of their National Pok\u00e9dex number. The first Pok\u00e9mon, Treecko, is number 252 and the last, Deoxys, is number 386. Alternate forms that result in type changes are included for convenience. Mega evolutions and regional forms are included on the pages for the generation in which they were introduced.\n\n\n\n\n## Design and development[edit]\n\n\n*Nintendo Life* noted in a retrospective that the third generation of *Pok\u00e9mon* has a very different \"feel\" from the two generations that came before it because almost all of its 135 new Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 save for Azurill and Wynaut \u2013 have no relation to those of the previous generations. *Ruby* and *Sapphire* features two \"Mythical Pok\u00e9mon\" \u2013 Jirachi and Deoxys \u2013 both of which became available to coincide with their respective anime movies.[1]\n\n\n*Pok\u00e9mon Ruby* and *Sapphire* significantly increased the amount of \"Dark\" and \"Steel\"-type Pok\u00e9mon in the series, as only a few Pok\u00e9mon in previous generations used these typings. *Hardcore Gamer* also noted that many of the new Pok\u00e9mon made use of \"dual typing\", where Pok\u00e9mon have both a primary and a secondary type; this was not nearly as common in *Red* and *Blue* or *Gold* and *Silver*.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Table of Dexes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Dex name | No. of Pokemon in Dex | No. in National Dex | percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hoenn Dex [Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald]\n | 202\n | 386\n | 52.33%  52.33%\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n |\n| Kanto Dex [FireRed and LeafGreen]\n | 151\n | 386\n | 39.12%  39.12%\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n |\n\n\n## List of Pok\u00e9mon[edit]\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n* Treecko\n* Grovyle\n* Sceptile\n* Torchic\n* Combusken\n* Blaziken\n* Mudkip\n* Marshtomp\n* Swampert\n* Poochyena\n* Mightyena\n* Zigzagoon\n* Linoone\n* Wurmple\n* Silcoon\n* Beautifly\n* Cascoon\n* Dustox\n* Lotad\n* Lombre\n* Ludicolo\n* Seedot\n* Nuzleaf\n* Shiftry\n* Taillow\n* Swellow\n* Wingull\n* Pelipper\n* Ralts\n* Kirlia\n* Gardevoir\n* Surskit\n* Masquerain\n* Shroomish\n* Breloom\n* Slakoth\n* Vigoroth\n* Slaking\n* Nincada\n* Ninjask\n* Shedinja\n* Whismur\n* Loudred\n* Exploud\n* Makuhita\n* Hariyama\n* Azurill\n* Nosepass\n* Skitty\n* Delcatty\n* Sableye\n* Mawile\n* Aron\n* Lairon\n* Aggron\n* Meditite\n* Medicham\n* Electrike\n* Manectric\n* Plusle\n* Minun\n* Volbeat\n* Illumise\n* Roselia\n* Gulpin\n* Swalot\n* Carvanha\n* Sharpedo\n* Wailmer\n* Wailord\n* Numel\n* Camerupt\n* Torkoal\n* Spoink\n* Grumpig\n* Spinda\n* Trapinch\n* Vibrava\n* Flygon\n* Cacnea\n* Cacturne\n* Swablu\n* Altaria\n* Zangoose\n* Seviper\n* Lunatone\n* Solrock\n* Barboach\n* Whiscash\n* Corphish\n* Crawdaunt\n* Baltoy\n* Claydol\n* Lileep\n* Cradily\n* Anorith\n* Armaldo\n* Feebas\n* Milotic\n* Castform\n* Kecleon\n* Shuppet\n* Banette\n* Duskull\n* Dusclops\n* Tropius\n* Chimecho\n* Absol\n* Wynaut\n* Snorunt\n* Glalie\n* Spheal\n* Sealeo\n* Walrein\n* Clamperl\n* Huntail\n* Gorebyss\n* Relicanth\n* Luvdisc\n* Bagon\n* Shelgon\n* Salamence\n* Beldum\n* Metang\n* Metagross\n* Regirock\n* Regice\n* Registeel\n* Latias\n* Latios\n* Kyogre\n* Groudon\n* Rayquaza\n* Jirachi\n* Deoxys\n\n\n\nList of Pok\u00e9mon species introduced in Generation III (2002)[nb 1]\n| Name\n | National Pok\u00e9dexnumber\n | Type(s) | Evolves from\n | Evolves into\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English\n | Japanese\n | Primary\n | Secondary\n |\n| Treecko\n | *Kimori* (\u30ad\u30e2\u30ea)[4] | 0252 | Grass\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Grovyle (#253) | Treecko has claws at the bottom of its feet so it can scale walls and ceilings.

Both Latias and Latios gained Mega Evolutions in *Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire.* which allowed the duo to be used in a new mechanic, soaring.\n |\n| Latios\n | *Ratiosu* (\u30e9\u30c6\u30a3\u30aa\u30b9)[5] | 0381 | Dragon | Psychic\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Mega Evolution | It is the other half of the Eon duo. Latios is very similar to its counterpart. Latios is shown capable of using an ability called 'Sight Sharing', allowing him to show others what he is seeing. It is the only Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning Luster Purge, which deals damage and has a 50% chance to lower its opponent's Special Defense stat by one stage. It is a bit better though when it comes to power compared to his counterpart Latias. Both him and Latias had starring roles in *Pok\u00e9mon Heroes*. Both Latias and Latios gained Mega Evolutions in *Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire.* which allowed the duo to be used in a new mechanic, soaring.\n |\n| Kyogre\n | *Kai\u014dga* (\u30ab\u30a4\u30aa\u30fc\u30ac)[38][56] | 0382 | Water\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Primal Reversion | Legends tell of it expanding the seas. It had a devastatingly powerful fight with Groudon over control of land until Rayquaza stopped them. In *Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire*, it was given a new type of form, a Primal Form.\n |\n| Groudon\n | *Gur\u0101don* (\u30b0\u30e9\u30fc\u30c9\u30f3)[29] | 0383 | Ground\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Primal Reversion | It can expand the land continuously. It had a destructive battle with Kyogre over rule of the land until Rayquaza stopped it. In *Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire*, it was given a new type of form, a Primal Form.\n |\n| Rayquaza\n | *Rekk\u016bza* (\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u30a6\u30b6)[57] | 0384 | Dragon | Flying\n | Beginning of evolution\n | Mega Evolution | It feeds on meteorites to fuel its Mega Evolution while it lives in the ozone layer. It once came down to stop the massive fight between Groudon and Kyogre. In *Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire*, it was given a Mega Evolution.\n |\n| Jirachi\n | *Jir\u0101chi* (\u30b8\u30e9\u30fc\u30c1)[33] | 0385 | Steel\n | Psychic\n | No evolution\n | Legend says that Jirachi sleeps every 1,000 years, and if you write your wishes on the tags on its forehead, it might grant them. Jirachi has an eye on its stomach, and is the only Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning Doom Desire. It was first made available via a bonus disc that came with *Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum*, which also showed a preview of the movie it starred in: *Pok\u00e9mon: Jirachi\u2014Wish Maker*.\n |\n| Deoxys\n | *Deokishisu* (\u30c7\u30aa\u30ad\u30b7\u30b9)[57] | 0386 | Psychic\n | No evolution\n | Deoxys is capable of changing between four \"Formes\": Normal, Attack, Defence, and Speed. Each of which differs by base stat values, effort value yield, and appearance.[58] Deoxys is an alien that was born when a crystal had been hit with UV rays. In March 2005, NASA teamed up with the *Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game* team to use Deoxys' likeness to educate children about outer space and the ozone layer. As part of this endeavor, NASA created browser games on its website and Nintendo of America distributed promotional bracelets and postcards.[59] It could be captured after completing a post game story titled The Delta Episode in *Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire*, being the first Mythical Pok\u00e9mon to be available outside of events. It also starred in its own movie alongside Rayquaza, *Pok\u00e9mon: Destiny Deoxys*.\n |\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nReception to Generation III's Pok\u00e9mon has been polarising. Alex Carlson of *Hardcore Gamer* wrote in 2014 that the third generation of *Pok\u00e9mon* games was not well received by fans of the series, with some people calling the generation the \"worst in the series history\".[2] This was in part because *Ruby* and *Sapphire* did not allow players to transfer in their Pok\u00e9mon from previous generations and, because of this, many older Pok\u00e9mon were completely unavailable in the games until *Pok\u00e9mon FireRed* and *LeafGreen* were released a few years later.[60] Meanwhile, many of the new Pok\u00e9mon designs, such as those for Torchic, Feebas, Luvdisc, Castform and Clamperl, were criticised for being unoriginal.[2][60][61] Contrastingly, some designs, including Breloom, Aggron, and the aforementioned Castform were praised for their coolness, with the large variety of unique legendary Pok\u00e9mon also helping the third generation feel fresh and new.[62] While *Ruby* and *Sapphire* were recognized for introducing less memorable designs than their predecessors, designs like Milotic, Salamence, Metagross, Rayquaza, and Blaziken made the overall generation a satisfying supplement to the existing Pok\u00e9dex.[63]\n\n\nThe third generation has had its share of enduringly popular designs. Eighteen years after the release of *Ruby* and *Sapphire*, Rayquaza and Gardevoir finished eighth and ninth in 2020's Pok\u00e9mon of the Year vote,[64] with Flygon, Sceptile, and Blaziken also among the top 30.[65] Rayquaza also finished eighth in a 2016 Japanese poll, with Jirachi and Kyogre among the top 25.[66] A popularity vote on the Pok\u00e9mon subreddit featured Blaziken at 5th, joined in the top 25 by Gardevoir, Absol, Flygon, and Mudkip.[67]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Details on Pok\u00e9mon names, National Pok\u00e9dex numbers, types and evolutions are obtained from The Pok\u00e9mon Company International's online Pok\u00e9dex.[3]\n2. **^** Only Galarian Linoone (introduced in *Pok\u00e9mon Sword* and *Shield*) are capable of evolving into Obstagoon.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Starting in *X* and *Y*, Ralts, Kirlia, Gardevoir, Azurill and Mawile all gained the Fairy type.\n4. **^** Only male Kirlia are capable of evolving into Gallade.
