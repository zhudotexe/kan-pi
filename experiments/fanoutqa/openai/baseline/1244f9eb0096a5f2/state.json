As a result, COVID-19 became the deadliest respiratory pandemic in recent American history.[155] The Associated Press called the new numbers a \"colossal tragedy\" because, despite a century of advances in science, the country failed to take full advantage of vaccines.[156] On October 1, the U.S. passed 700,000 deaths.[157] On October 18, the U.S. passed 45\u00a0million cases.[158] On November 26, Biden announced that the U.S. will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other African countries due to concerns over a new variant from the area, called Omicron.[159]\n\n\n\n### December 2021 to March 2022[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Ollstein AM (April 14, 2020). \"Trump halts funding to World Health Organization\". *Politico*.

Fauci warned of an \"uptick\" in cases like Europe has seen recently, stating the U.S. should \"be prepared for the possibility that we might get another variant\".[163]\n\n\n\n### April to June 2022[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy June, COVID-19 cases rose again, especially in Arkansas, Nevada, Missouri, and Wyoming. The rising numbers were believed to be attributable to the Delta variant.[146] By July 7, the Delta variant had surpassed the Alpha variant to become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S., according to CDC data.[147] By August the Delta variant accounted for 99 percent of all cases and was found to double the risk of hospitalization for those not yet vaccinated.[148]\n\n\nOn August 1, the U.S. passed 35\u00a0million cases.[149] By early and mid-August, hospitals in some states with low vaccination rates began to exceed capacity.[150] One-quarter of the U.S. population resides in eight states\u2014Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and Texas\u2014but, by mid-August, these states together had a half of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the nation.[151] By the end of the month, the ICUs of five of those\u2014Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Texas\u2014were over 90% full.[152]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy May 27, less than four months after the pandemic reached the U.S., 100,000 Americans had died with COVID-19.[84] State economic reopenings and lack of widespread mask orders resulted in a sharp rise in cases across most of the continental U.S. outside of the Northeast.[85] A study conducted in May 2020 indicated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was much higher than the number of confirmed cases with some locations having 6\u201324 times higher infections, which was further confirmed by a later population-wide serosurvey.[86][87][88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** Wayland M (January 30, 2020). \"Trump says coronavirus outbreak is 'all under control' and a 'very small problem' in US\".

The CDC did not report its confirmation until April 21,[59] by which point nine other COVID-19 deaths had occurred in Santa Clara County.[60] The virus had been circulating undetected at least since early January and possibly as early as November.[61] On February 25, the CDC warned the American public for the first time to prepare for a local outbreak.[62][63] The next day, New York City saw the sickening of its \"patient zero\", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz, then thought to be the first community-acquired case.[64][65][66] Another case known as \"patient zero\" in Los Angeles is a man named Gregg Garfield, who spent 64 days in the Burbank Hospital, on a ventilator for 30 days, with a 1% chance to live. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n202. **^** \"Boeing donating 250,000 medical masks to battle coronavirus in China\".

The totals for these two months reflect about 1.6 times the number of cases and 0.81 times the number of deaths from the same months in 2021.[160]\n\n\nOn September 18, 2022, in an appearance on *60 Minutes*, president Joe Biden declared his belief that the COVID-19 pandemic was \"over\" in the United States.[175][176] This assessment met some debate in the medical community: at the time, the United\u00a0States had roughly 400 deaths from the disease per day, and when extrapolated to 150,000 per year is three times the fatality rate of a bad flu season.[177]\n\n\nThe number of cases for the months of July through September 2022 was about 0.86 times the number for the same period in 2021, and the number of COVID-attributed deaths likewise averaged 0.42 times the number for the same period in 2021.[160]\n\n\n\n### October to December 2022[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** Montague, Zach (January 30, 2021). \"The C.D.C.

Thus, it is highly unlikely that it was circulating in Brazil before early 2020.[19] Researchers from the Institute of Tropical Medicine and international colleagues showed in the scientific journal Science that the first sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil occurred between late February and early March 2020.[20]\n\n\n### 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **21 January:** Research from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and the Conectas Direitos Humanos\u00a0[pt] revealed the \"existence of an institutional strategy to spread the virus, promoted by the Brazilian Government under the leadership of the Presidency of the Republic\".[100][101]![](image)Pharmaceutical company Uni\u00e3o Quimica started production of Sputnik V vaccine in Brazil in January 2021\n* **27 January:** Brazil reaches 220,000 deaths.[102] *The Lancet* publishes an article concerning the possible causes of an \"unexpected\" increase in January hospital admissions in Manaus, including the emergence of the P.1. variant.

Repeated lockdown extensions were mainly motivated by the appearance of the Alpha variant and other mutations. Death rates in nursing homes remained high until late January 2021[20] but dropped strongly in February, likely due to residents and workers at these facilities having been prioritised in the vaccination campaign.[21] The second wave peaked in January.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs early as January 2020, the German Bundestag was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic.

It further stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". But until 24 March, the Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance\u00a0[de] (BBK) had never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation, was the criticism of some experts.[65]\n\n\n\n## Timeline by state[edit]\n\n\nFor a day-by-day chart, see Template:COVID-19 pandemic data/Germany medical cases chart.\n\n\n\n![Cases](image)\nCases\n![Deaths](image)\nDeaths\n\n### Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Philippines)\n* Central Epidemic Command Center (Taiwan)\n* Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board (Turkey)\n* COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (United Kingdom)\n* Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team (United Kingdom)\n* Joint Biosecurity Centre (United Kingdom)\n* Vaccine Taskforce (United Kingdom)\n* COVID-19 Advisory Board (United States)\n* Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups (United States)\n* White House Coronavirus Task Force (United States)\n* White House COVID-19 Response Team (United States)\n* GACH (Uruguay)\n |\n| Relief funds | * PM CARES Fund (India)\n* SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund (India)\n* Artist Relief (United States)\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| People\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWarnings of a \"massive fifth wave\" driven by Omicron in December[35] proved to be no exaggeration as daily case numbers rose up to over 200,000 by mid February 2022, and remained at a high level in March.
