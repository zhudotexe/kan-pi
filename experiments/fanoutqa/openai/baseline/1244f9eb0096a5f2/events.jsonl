As a result, COVID-19 became the deadliest respiratory pandemic in recent American history.[155] The Associated Press called the new numbers a \"colossal tragedy\" because, despite a century of advances in science, the country failed to take full advantage of vaccines.[156] On October 1, the U.S. passed 700,000 deaths.[157] On October 18, the U.S. passed 45 million cases.[158] On November 26, Biden announced that the U.S. will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other African countries due to concerns over a new variant from the area, called Omicron.[159]\n\n\n\n### December 2021 to March 2022[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Ollstein AM (April 14, 2020). \"Trump halts funding to World Health Organization\". *Politico*.

Fauci warned of an \"uptick\" in cases like Europe has seen recently, stating the U.S. should \"be prepared for the possibility that we might get another variant\".[163]\n\n\n\n### April to June 2022[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy June, COVID-19 cases rose again, especially in Arkansas, Nevada, Missouri, and Wyoming. The rising numbers were believed to be attributable to the Delta variant.[146] By July 7, the Delta variant had surpassed the Alpha variant to become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S., according to CDC data.[147] By August the Delta variant accounted for 99 percent of all cases and was found to double the risk of hospitalization for those not yet vaccinated.[148]\n\n\nOn August 1, the U.S. passed 35 million cases.[149] By early and mid-August, hospitals in some states with low vaccination rates began to exceed capacity.[150] One-quarter of the U.S. population resides in eight states—Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and Texas—but, by mid-August, these states together had a half of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the nation.[151] By the end of the month, the ICUs of five of those—Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Texas—were over 90% full.[152]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy May 27, less than four months after the pandemic reached the U.S., 100,000 Americans had died with COVID-19.[84] State economic reopenings and lack of widespread mask orders resulted in a sharp rise in cases across most of the continental U.S. outside of the Northeast.[85] A study conducted in May 2020 indicated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was much higher than the number of confirmed cases with some locations having 6–24 times higher infections, which was further confirmed by a later population-wide serosurvey.[86][87][88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** Wayland M (January 30, 2020). \"Trump says coronavirus outbreak is 'all under control' and a 'very small problem' in US\".

The CDC did not report its confirmation until April 21,[59] by which point nine other COVID-19 deaths had occurred in Santa Clara County.[60] The virus had been circulating undetected at least since early January and possibly as early as November.[61] On February 25, the CDC warned the American public for the first time to prepare for a local outbreak.[62][63] The next day, New York City saw the sickening of its \"patient zero\", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz, then thought to be the first community-acquired case.[64][65][66] Another case known as \"patient zero\" in Los Angeles is a man named Gregg Garfield, who spent 64 days in the Burbank Hospital, on a ventilator for 30 days, with a 1% chance to live. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n202. **^** \"Boeing donating 250,000 medical masks to battle coronavirus in China\".

The totals for these two months reflect about 1.6 times the number of cases and 0.81 times the number of deaths from the same months in 2021.[160]\n\n\nOn September 18, 2022, in an appearance on *60 Minutes*, president Joe Biden declared his belief that the COVID-19 pandemic was \"over\" in the United States.[175][176] This assessment met some debate in the medical community: at the time, the United States had roughly 400 deaths from the disease per day, and when extrapolated to 150,000 per year is three times the fatality rate of a bad flu season.[177]\n\n\nThe number of cases for the months of July through September 2022 was about 0.86 times the number for the same period in 2021, and the number of COVID-attributed deaths likewise averaged 0.42 times the number for the same period in 2021.[160]\n\n\n\n### October to December 2022[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** Montague, Zach (January 30, 2021). \"The C.D.C.

The CDC did not report its confirmation until April 21,[59] by which point nine other COVID-19 deaths had occurred in Santa Clara County.[60] The virus had been circulating undetected at least since early January and possibly as early as November.[61] On February 25, the CDC warned the American public for the first time to prepare for a local outbreak.[62][63] The next day, New York City saw the sickening of its \"patient zero\", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz, then thought to be the first community-acquired case.[64][65][66] Another case known as \"patient zero\" in Los Angeles is a man named Gregg Garfield, who spent 64 days in the Burbank Hospital, on a ventilator for 30 days, with a 1% chance to live. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n202. **^** \"Boeing donating 250,000 medical masks to battle coronavirus in China\".

A second wave of infections began in June, following relaxed restrictions in several states, leading to daily cases surpassing 60,000. By mid-October, a third surge of cases began; there were over 200,000 new daily cases during parts of December 2020 and January 2021.[26][27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** Chan C, Shumaker L, Maler S (March 28, 2020). \"Confirmed coronavirus cases in U.S. reach 100,000: Reuters tally\".

Subsequent samplings are positive on 11 December 2019 and 20 February 2020.

Thus, it is highly unlikely that it was circulating in Brazil before early 2020.[19] Researchers from the Institute of Tropical Medicine and international colleagues showed in the scientific journal Science that the first sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil occurred between late February and early March 2020.[20]\n\n\n### 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **21 January:** Research from the University of São Paulo and the Conectas Direitos Humanos [pt] revealed the \"existence of an institutional strategy to spread the virus, promoted by the Brazilian Government under the leadership of the Presidency of the Republic\".[100][101]![](image)Pharmaceutical company União Quimica started production of Sputnik V vaccine in Brazil in January 2021\n* **27 January:** Brazil reaches 220,000 deaths.[102] *The Lancet* publishes an article concerning the possible causes of an \"unexpected\" increase in January hospital admissions in Manaus, including the emergence of the P.1. variant.

The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro was attempting to create a serology test, as opposed to the more common PCR test, to detect infections through a patient's blood samples.[159]\nMinister of Health Luiz Henrique Mandetta said that the number of cases would increase exponentially until the end of June.[160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Fongaro, Gislaine; Stoco, Patrícia Hermes; Souza, Doris Sobral Marques; Grisard, Edmundo Carlos; Magri, Maria Elisa; Rogovski, Paula; Schörner, Marcos André; Barazzetti, Fernando Hartmann; Christoff, Ana Paula; De Oliveira, Luiz Felipe Valter; Bazzo, Maria Luiza; Wagner, Glauber; Hernández, Marta; Rodríguez-Lázaro, David (2021). \"The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human sewage in Santa Catarina, Brazil, November 2019\". *Science of the Total Environment*. **778**: 146198.

Subsequent samplings are positive on 11 December 2019 and 20 February 2020. These samples can show that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in Brazil at least as early as late November 2019.[18] However, this is highly contested by the scientific consensus which shows that the virus emerged in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Thus, it is highly unlikely that it was circulating in Brazil before early 2020.[19] Researchers from the Institute of Tropical Medicine and international colleagues showed in the scientific journal Science that the first sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil occurred between late February and early March 2020.[20]\n\n\n### 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **21 January:** Research from the University of São Paulo and the Conectas Direitos Humanos [pt] revealed the \"existence of an institutional strategy to spread the virus, promoted by the Brazilian Government under the leadership of the Presidency of the Republic\".[100][101]![](image)Pharmaceutical company União Quimica started production of Sputnik V vaccine in Brazil in January 2021\n* **27 January:** Brazil reaches 220,000 deaths.[102] *The Lancet* publishes an article concerning the possible causes of an \"unexpected\" increase in January hospital admissions in Manaus, including the emergence of the P.1. variant.

The cases in Lahn-Dill and Giessen were linked to the cluster in NRW, and the case in Hochtaunuskreis to the one in Lahn-Dill.[102]\n\n\nAfter the ease of lockdown for religious groups on 1 May,[103] a church service on 10 May in Frankfurt led to a cluster that grew to 112 cases by 25 May. The service was later determined to have breached several regulations, including those that the major churches had given themselves. The church evaded penalties through participation in a study by the RKI, whose scientists had expressed great interest in studying the outbreak in detail. All of the infected had recovered by 24 June.[104]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** Murray, Miranda (28 October 2021). \"Germany's COVID caseload makes biggest leap in two weeks\". *Reuters*.

By 24 May at least 10 of the participants had tested positive and quarantine was ordered for 70 people.[105]\n\n\nOn 31 May 2020, a new cluster with 36 confirmed infections was reported in Göttingen. The local authorities checked Hookah lounges to find the source of the infections.[106] Mayor Rolf-Georg Köhler informed the public on 2 June that the cluster originated in Eid al-Fitr celebrations by several families on 23 May where social distancing rules had been ignored.[107] On 4 June 2020, the city reported 86 infections from the cluster and some 216 people had been ordered in quarantine. All schools were closed again and all contact and team sports were prohibited for 2 weeks.[108]\n\n\n\n### North Rhine-Westphalia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in North Rhine-Westphalia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n151. **^** \"Inside Germany's coronavirus quarantine camp\".

Repeated lockdown extensions were mainly motivated by the appearance of the Alpha variant and other mutations. Death rates in nursing homes remained high until late January 2021[20] but dropped strongly in February, likely due to residents and workers at these facilities having been prioritised in the vaccination campaign.[21] The second wave peaked in January.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs early as January 2020, the German Bundestag was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [...] have [...] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It further stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". But until 24 March, the Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance [de] (BBK) had never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation, was the criticism of some experts.[65]\n\n\n\n## Timeline by state[edit]\n\n\nFor a day-by-day chart, see Template:COVID-19 pandemic data/Germany medical cases chart.\n\n\n\n![Cases](image)\nCases\n![Deaths](image)\nDeaths\n\n### Baden-Württemberg[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Philippines)\n* Central Epidemic Command Center (Taiwan)\n* Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board (Turkey)\n* COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (United Kingdom)\n* Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team (United Kingdom)\n* Joint Biosecurity Centre (United Kingdom)\n* Vaccine Taskforce (United Kingdom)\n* COVID-19 Advisory Board (United States)\n* Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups (United States)\n* White House Coronavirus Task Force (United States)\n* White House COVID-19 Response Team (United States)\n* GACH (Uruguay)\n |\n| Relief funds | * PM CARES Fund (India)\n* SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund (India)\n* Artist Relief (United States)\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| People\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWarnings of a \"massive fifth wave\" driven by Omicron in December[35] proved to be no exaggeration as daily case numbers rose up to over 200,000 by mid February 2022, and remained at a high level in March. Experts considered the absence of a decrease to be due to the BA.2 subvariant of Omicron, which had ushered in the sixth wave of the pandemic, and expected more cases after the easing of pandemic measures scheduled to begin on 21 March.[36][37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n143. **^** \"Kein Karneval am 11.11. – \"Wir feiern nicht, wir öffnen nicht\"\". *stadt-koeln.de*.\n144. **^** \"11.11.2020: Keine Feiern, kein Alkohol und wenig Karneval\". *zdf.de*.\n145. **^** Aktuell, S.

Repeated lockdown extensions were mainly motivated by the appearance of the Alpha variant and other mutations. Death rates in nursing homes remained high until late January 2021[20] but dropped strongly in February, likely due to residents and workers at these facilities having been prioritised in the vaccination campaign.[21] The second wave peaked in January.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs early as January 2020, the German Bundestag was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic.

It further stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". But until 24 March, the Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance [de] (BBK) had never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation, was the criticism of some experts.[65]\n\n\n\n## Timeline by state[edit]\n\n\nFor a day-by-day chart, see Template:COVID-19 pandemic data/Germany medical cases chart.\n\n\n\n![Cases](image)\nCases\n![Deaths](image)\nDeaths\n\n### Baden-Württemberg[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Philippines)\n* Central Epidemic Command Center (Taiwan)\n* Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board (Turkey)\n* COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (United Kingdom)\n* Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team (United Kingdom)\n* Joint Biosecurity Centre (United Kingdom)\n* Vaccine Taskforce (United Kingdom)\n* COVID-19 Advisory Board (United States)\n* Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups (United States)\n* White House Coronavirus Task Force (United States)\n* White House COVID-19 Response Team (United States)\n* GACH (Uruguay)\n |\n| Relief funds | * PM CARES Fund (India)\n* SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund (India)\n* Artist Relief (United States)\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| People\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWarnings of a \"massive fifth wave\" driven by Omicron in December[35] proved to be no exaggeration as daily case numbers rose up to over 200,000 by mid February 2022, and remained at a high level in March.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans. On 4 March, the RKI published an extension of the national plan, which it had produced in collaboration with several other entities, for the handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Four major targets are included in this plan:[64]\n\n\n\n* Reduce morbidity and mortality\n* Ensure treatment of infected persons\n* Upkeep of essential public services\n* Reliable and accurate information for decision-makers, medical professionals, media and public\n\n\nThe plan has three stages, which might eventually overlap due to regional differences in the evolution of the pandemic:[64]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n90. **^** \"Nach Test-Debakel: Huml will heute informieren\". *Bayerischer Rundfunk* (in German). 16 August 2020.
