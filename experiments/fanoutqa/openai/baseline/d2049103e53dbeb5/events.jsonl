Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice.[d] The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year[12] and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMass logging for construction of the Olympic venues received international criticism. Petitions, containing more than 140,000 signatures in total, were delivered to the Japanese embassies in Switzerland and Germany, expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging, and rainforest destruction.[245][246] In February 2018, the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests.[247]\n\n\nPortions of the Games were scheduled for locations impacted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The hosting of events in these locations was promoted as a means of furthering recovery in the regions, with the Games sometimes being promoted as the \"Recovery Olympics\".[248][249]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Cervantes, Alberto (23 July 2021). \"The Tokyo Olympics' Staggering Price Tag and Where It Stands in History\". *The Wall Street Journal*.

NBC paid substantial fees for rights to the Olympics, so the IOC has allowed NBC to influence event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible. On 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through the 2032 games,[223] with the company being one of the IOC's major sources of revenue.[224] Japanese broadcasters were said to have criticized the decision, as swimming is one of the most popular Olympic events in the country.[225][226]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. **^** \"Tokyo 2020 candidature file – section 8 – Sports and Venues\" (PDF).

Two of the events were held in late 2018, but the main test event schedule commenced in June 2019 and was originally due to be completed in May 2020 prior to the start of the Olympics. Several of the events were incorporated into pre-existing championships, but some have been newly created specifically to serve as Olympic test events for the 2020 Summer Games.[196][197]\n\n\nIn February 2019, it was announced that the test events would be branded under the banner \"Ready, Steady, Tokyo\". The Tokyo Organizing Committee is responsible for 22 of the test events, with the remaining events being arranged by national and international sports federations. The first test event was World Sailing's World Cup Series, held at Enoshima in September 2018. The last scheduled event is the Tokyo Challenge Track Meet, which was originally due to take place at the Olympic Stadium on 6 May 2020.[198]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Games featured 339 events in 33 different sports, encompassing a total of 50 disciplines.

The Tokyo games were NBC's first Olympics broadcast under current president Susan Rosner Rovner.[300]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Tokyo's former National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a ¥100 billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics.[98] In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced that it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design—which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine—and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and \"optimize\" the design.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 12 February 2013, with a remit to control the cost of the Games and ensure they are \"relevant to sports fans of all generations\", the IOC Executive Board recommended the removal of one of the 26 sports contested at the 2012 Summer Olympics, leaving a vacancy which the IOC would seek to fill at the 125th IOC Session. The new entrant would join golf and rugby sevens (which would both debut in 2016) as part of the program of 28 \"core\" sports. Five sports were shortlisted for removal, including canoe, field hockey, modern pentathlon, taekwondo, and wrestling. In the final round of voting by the executive board, eight members voted to remove wrestling from the Olympic program.

The first phase of the relay began on 12 March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19 March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent.[127] The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20 March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami—Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima—where it would go on display under the heading \"Flame of Recovery\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 20 March 2021, it was announced that due to COVID-19-related concerns, no international guests would be allowed to attend the 2020 Olympics or Paralympics. This included both spectators, as well as the friends and family of athletes. All overseas ticketholders would be refunded.[138] Hashimoto cited uncertainties surrounding international travel restrictions, and goals to preserve the safety of all participants and spectators, and not place a burden on the health care system.[138] It was ultimately announced in July that all local spectators were not allowed to attend any events held in Tokyo, Fukushima and Hokkaido.[150][151][154]\n\n\n\n### Cultural festival[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInstead, the story of the 2020/2021 Tokyo Olympics was more mundane, that of a state doing a decent job of managing Covid and hosting a mega-event against the wishes of many of its inhabitants.\"[281]\n\n\nA number of controversies arose during the Games, most notably the attempted repatriation on 1 August of Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, allegedly for her criticism of the national sports authorities and team management.[282] Refusing to return to Belarus, over fears for her safety,[283] Tsimanouskaya sought assistance from the IOC and traveled to Warsaw, Poland, on 4 August after being granted a humanitarian visa by Tokyo's Polish Embassy.[284]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 6 April 2021, North Korea announced that it would not participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics because of COVID-19 concerns.[208] This marked North Korea's first absence from the Summer Olympics since 1988.[209] In September, a month after the games concluded, the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was banned from participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics, after they failed to participate in the Tokyo Olympics. On 21 July 2021, Guinea announced it would not be sending a delegation to the Tokyo Olympics, allegedly due to COVID-19 concerns, though media outlets suggested that financial considerations may have been the real motivating factor.[210] Guinea later reversed the decision and confirmed that it would be participating.[211]\n\n\n\n![](image)Participating nations\n![](image)Country by team size\nThe following 206 teams qualified (including the 104 universality places guaranteed in athletics, under which all 206 NOCs may send competitors regardless of qualification).[212]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Shimizu, Kazuki; Sridhar, Devi; Taniguchi, Kiyosu; Shibuya, Kenji (14 April 2021). \"Reconsider this summer's Olympic and Paralympic games\". *BMJ*. **373**: n962. doi:10.1136/bmj.n962.

Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year[12] and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMass logging for construction of the Olympic venues received international criticism. Petitions, containing more than 140,000 signatures in total, were delivered to the Japanese embassies in Switzerland and Germany, expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging, and rainforest destruction.[245][246] In February 2018, the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests.[247]\n\n\nPortions of the Games were scheduled for locations impacted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

The Tokyo games were NBC's first Olympics broadcast under current president Susan Rosner Rovner.[300]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Tokyo's former National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a ¥100 billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics.[98] In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced that it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design—which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine—and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and \"optimize\" the design.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 12 February 2013, with a remit to control the cost of the Games and ensure they are \"relevant to sports fans of all generations\", the IOC Executive Board recommended the removal of one of the 26 sports contested at the 2012 Summer Olympics, leaving a vacancy which the IOC would seek to fill at the 125th IOC Session. The new entrant would join golf and rugby sevens (which would both debut in 2016) as part of the program of 28 \"core\" sports. Five sports were shortlisted for removal, including canoe, field hockey, modern pentathlon, taekwondo, and wrestling. In the final round of voting by the executive board, eight members voted to remove wrestling from the Olympic program. Hockey and taekwondo were both tied in second with three votes each.[181][182][183]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Cumulative total |  |  |  | 11 | 29 | 50 | 72 | 95 | 112 | 133 | 154 | 179 | 199 | 225 | 242 | 269 | 292 | 326 | 339\n |\n| July/August 2021\n | 21stWed\n | 22ndThu\n | 23rdFri\n | 24thSat\n | 25thSun\n | 26thMon\n | 27thTue\n | 28thWed\n | 29thThu\n | 30thFri\n | 31stSat\n | 1stSun\n | 2ndMon\n | 3rdTue\n | 4thWed\n | 5thThu\n | 6thFri\n | 7thSat\n | 8thSun\n | Total events\n |\n| July\n | August\n |\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Summer Olympics medal table and List of 2020 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\n  \\*   Host nation (Japan)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe official emblems for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 25 April 2016; designed by Asao Tokolo, who won a nationwide design contest, it takes the form of a ring in an indigo-colored checkerboard pattern. The design was meant to \"express a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan\".[227] The checkered design resembles a pattern called *ichimatsu moyo* that was popular during the Edo period in Japan from 1603 to 1867.[228] The designs replaced a previous emblem which had been scrapped after allegations that it plagiarized the logo of the Théâtre de Liège in Belgium. The Games' bid slogan was *Discover Tomorrow* (Japanese: 未来（あした）をつかもう, romanized: *Ashita o tsukamō*). While *ashita* literally means \"tomorrow\", it is intentionally spelled as *mirai*, \"future\".[229] The official slogan *United by Emotion* was unveiled on 17 February 2020.

The first phase of the relay began on 12 March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19 March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent.[127] The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20 March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami—Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima—where it would go on display under the heading \"Flame of Recovery\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 20 March 2021, it was announced that due to COVID-19-related concerns, no international guests would be allowed to attend the 2020 Olympics or Paralympics.

On 21 July 2021, Guinea announced it would not be sending a delegation to the Tokyo Olympics, allegedly due to COVID-19 concerns, though media outlets suggested that financial considerations may have been the real motivating factor.[210] Guinea later reversed the decision and confirmed that it would be participating.[211]\n\n\n\n![](image)Participating nations\n![](image)Country by team size\nThe following 206 teams qualified (including the 104 universality places guaranteed in athletics, under which all 206 NOCs may send competitors regardless of qualification).[212]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Shimizu, Kazuki; Sridhar, Devi; Taniguchi, Kiyosu; Shibuya, Kenji (14 April 2021). \"Reconsider this summer's Olympic and Paralympic games\". *BMJ*. **373**: n962. doi:10.1136/bmj.n962.

This scheduling practice affected the events themselves, including skaters having to adjust to the modified schedule, as well as attendance levels at the sessions.[48]\n\n\nConversely, and somewhat controversially, eight of the eleven biathlon events were scheduled at night, making it necessary for competitors to ski and shoot under floodlights, with colder temperatures and blustery winds.[49]\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n87. **^** \"PyeongChang will host first major 5G video demonstrations for Olympics viewers\". *VentureBeat*. 31 January 2018.

Norway led the total medal tally with 39, followed by Germany at 31 and Canada at 29.[1] Germany and Norway were tied for the highest number of gold medals, both winning 14.\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding and election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| **Pyeongchang Winter Olympics** |\n| Hangul | 평창 동계 올림픽 대회\n |\n| Hanja | 平昌冬季올림픽大會\n |\n| Revised Romanization | *Pyeongchang Donggye Ollimpik Daehoe* |\n| McCune–Reischauer | *P'yŏngch'ang Tonggye Ollimp'ik Taehoe* |\n| XXIII Olympic Winter Games |\n| Hangul | 제23회 동계 올림픽 대회\n |\n| Hanja | 第二十三回冬季올림픽大會\n |\n| Revised Romanization | *Jeisipsamhoe Donggye Ollimpik Daehoe* |\n| McCune–Reischauer | *Cheisipsamhoe Tonggye Ollimp'ik Taehoe* |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![Olympic rings](image) |\n| Part of a series on |\n| 2018 Winter Olympics |\n| * Bid process (bid details)\n* Venues\n* Torch relay\n* Marketing (mascots)\n* Broadcasters\n* Opening ceremony (flag bearers)\n* Chronological summary\n* Event calendar\n* Medal table (medalists)\n* World and Olympic records\n* Controversies (Russian doping scandal)\n* Closing ceremony (flag bearers)\n* Paralympics\n\n* **IOC**\n* **KOC**\n* **POCOG**\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Participating National Olympic Committees[40][41][42][43][44][45] |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Albania (2)\n* ![](image) Andorra (5)\n* ![](image) Argentina (7)\n* ![](image) Armenia (3)\n* ![](image) Australia (50)\n* ![](image) Austria (105)\n* ![](image) Azerbaijan (1)\n* ![](image) Belarus (33)\n* ![](image) Belgium (22)\n* ![](image) Bermuda (1)\n* ![](image) Bolivia (2)\n* ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (4)\n* ![](image) Brazil (9)\n* ![](image) Bulgaria (21)\n* ![](image) Canada (225)\n* ![](image) Chile (7)\n* ![](image) China (80)\n* ![](image) Chinese Taipei (4)\n* ![](image) Colombia (4)\n* ![](image) Croatia (19)\n* ![](image) Cyprus (1)\n* ![](image) Czech Republic (93)\n* ![](image) Denmark (17)\n* ![](image) East Timor (1)\n* ![](image) Ecuador (1)\n* ![](image) Eritrea (1)\n* ![](image) Estonia (22)\n* ![](image) Finland (100)\n* ![](image) France (106)\n* ![](image) Georgia (4)\n* ![](image) Germany (156)\n* ![](image) Ghana (1)\n* ![](image) Great Britain (58)\n* ![](image) Greece (4)\n* ![](image) Hong Kong (1)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nXXIII Olympic Winter Games| ![PyeongChang 2018 Olympic official emblem](image)Emblem of the 2018 Winter Olympics\n |\n| Host city | Pyeongchang, South Korea |\n| Motto | * *Passion.

The Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games (POCOG) was launched at its inaugural assembly on 19 October 2011. The first tasks of the organizing committee were putting together a master plan for the Games as well as forming a design for the venues.[8] The IOC Coordination Commission for the 2018 Winter Olympics made their first visit to Pyeongchang in March 2012. By then, construction was already underway on the Olympic Village.[9][10] In June 2012, construction began on a high-speed rail line that would connect Pyeongchang to Seoul.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the United States, the Games were once again broadcast by NBCUniversal properties under a long-term contract (this would be the only time that the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics will be held on NBC on the same year).[78][79] On 28 March 2017, NBC announced that it would adopt a new format for its primetime coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics, with a focus on live coverage in all time zones to take advantage of Pyeongchang's 14-hour difference with U.S. Eastern Time (and 17-hour difference with U.S. Pacific Time), and to address criticism of its previous tape delay practices. As before, the primetime block began at 8:00 p.m. ET (5:00 p.m. PT), and unlike previous Olympics, was available for streaming. Figure skating events were deliberately scheduled with morning sessions so they could be aired during primetime in the Americas (and in turn, NBC's coverage; due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 11 October 2017, domestic ticket sales for the Games were reported to be slow. Of the 750,000 seats allocated to South Koreans, only 20.7% had been sold. International sales were more favorable, with 59.7% of the 320,000 allocated tickets sold.[23][24] However, as of 31 January 2018, 77% of all tickets had been sold.[25]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Parade of Nations at 2018 Olympic opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 9 February 2018.

On 20 September 2017, South Korean president Moon Jae-in stated that the country would ensure the security of the Games.[99] The next day, Laura Flessel-Colovic, the French Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, stated that France would pull out of the Games if the safety of its delegation could not be guaranteed.[100]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder a historic agreement facilitated by the IOC, qualified athletes from North Korea were allowed to cross the Korean Demilitarized Zone into South Korea to compete in the Games.[33][34][35] The two nations marched together under the Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony.[36][37] A unified Korean team, consisting of 12 players from North Korea and 23 from South Korea, competed in the women's ice hockey tournament under a special IOC country code designation (COR) following talks in Panmunjom on 17 January 2018.[36] The two nations also participated separately: the South Korea team competed in every sport, while the North Korea team competed in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and short track speed skating.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPortals:* ![icon](image) 2010s\n* ![](image) Olympic Games\n* ![map](image) Korea\n* ![flag](image) South Korea\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe eventual number of neutral Russian athletes that participated at the 2018 Games was 168.

Two athletes, who met the conditions and were cleared by the IOC, subsequently failed drug tests during the Games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese moves were met with opposition in South Korea, including protests and online petitions; critics argued that the government was attempting to use the Olympics to spread pro-North Korean sentiment, and that the unified ice hockey team would fail.[107] A rap video entitled \"The Regret for Pyeongchang\" (평창유감), which echoed this criticism and called the event the \"Pyongyang Olympics\", went viral in the country.[108] Japan's foreign affairs minister Tarō Kōno warned South Korea to be wary of North Korea's \"charm offensive\", and not to ease its pressure on the country.[36][109]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n111. **^** Friedman, Uri. \"North Korea's Undeserved Olympic Glory\". *The Atlantic*.

This scheduling practice affected the events themselves, including skaters having to adjust to the modified schedule, as well as attendance levels at the sessions.[48]\n\n\nConversely, and somewhat controversially, eight of the eleven biathlon events were scheduled at night, making it necessary for competitors to ski and shoot under floodlights, with colder temperatures and blustery winds.[49]\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n87. **^** \"PyeongChang will host first major 5G video demonstrations for Olympics viewers\". *VentureBeat*. 31 January 2018.

The Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games (POCOG) was launched at its inaugural assembly on 19 October 2011. The first tasks of the organizing committee were putting together a master plan for the Games as well as forming a design for the venues.[8] The IOC Coordination Commission for the 2018 Winter Olympics made their first visit to Pyeongchang in March 2012. By then, construction was already underway on the Olympic Village.[9][10] In June 2012, construction began on a high-speed rail line that would connect Pyeongchang to Seoul.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the United States, the Games were once again broadcast by NBCUniversal properties under a long-term contract (this would be the only time that the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics will be held on NBC on the same year).[78][79] On 28 March 2017, NBC announced that it would adopt a new format for its primetime coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics, with a focus on live coverage in all time zones to take advantage of Pyeongchang's 14-hour difference with U.S. Eastern Time (and 17-hour difference with U.S. Pacific Time), and to address criticism of its previous tape delay practices. As before, the primetime block began at 8:00 p.m. ET (5:00 p.m. PT), and unlike previous Olympics, was available for streaming. Figure skating events were deliberately scheduled with morning sessions so they could be aired during primetime in the Americas (and in turn, NBC's coverage; due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 11 October 2017, domestic ticket sales for the Games were reported to be slow. Of the 750,000 seats allocated to South Koreans, only 20.7% had been sold. International sales were more favorable, with 59.7% of the 320,000 allocated tickets sold.[23][24] However, as of 31 January 2018, 77% of all tickets had been sold.[25]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Parade of Nations at 2018 Olympic opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 9 February 2018.

Of those athletes, 42 appealed against their bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and 28 of the appeals were successful, but eleven of the athletes had their sanctions upheld due to the weight of evidence against them. The IOC found it important to note that CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\" and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. Hearings for the remaining three athletes were postponed.[118]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: North Korea–South Korea relations, 2017–18 North Korea crisis, and North Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\nDue to the state of relations between North and South Korea, concerns were raised over the security of the 2018 Winter Olympics, especially in the wake of tensions over North Korean missile and nuclear tests. On 20 September 2017, South Korean president Moon Jae-in stated that the country would ensure the security of the Games.[99] The next day, Laura Flessel-Colovic, the French Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, stated that France would pull out of the Games if the safety of its delegation could not be guaranteed.[100]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder a historic agreement facilitated by the IOC, qualified athletes from North Korea were allowed to cross the Korean Demilitarized Zone into South Korea to compete in the Games.[33][34][35] The two nations marched together under the Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony.[36][37] A unified Korean team, consisting of 12 players from North Korea and 23 from South Korea, competed in the women's ice hockey tournament under a special IOC country code designation (COR) following talks in Panmunjom on 17 January 2018.[36] The two nations also participated separately: the South Korea team competed in every sport, while the North Korea team competed in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and short track speed skating.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPortals:* ![icon](image) 2010s\n* ![](image) Olympic Games\n* ![map](image) Korea\n* ![flag](image) South Korea\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe eventual number of neutral Russian athletes that participated at the 2018 Games was 168.

Two athletes, who met the conditions and were cleared by the IOC, subsequently failed drug tests during the Games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese moves were met with opposition in South Korea, including protests and online petitions; critics argued that the government was attempting to use the Olympics to spread pro-North Korean sentiment, and that the unified ice hockey team would fail.[107] A rap video entitled \"The Regret for Pyeongchang\" (평창유감), which echoed this criticism and called the event the \"Pyongyang Olympics\", went viral in the country.[108] Japan's foreign affairs minister Tarō Kōno warned South Korea to be wary of North Korea's \"charm offensive\", and not to ease its pressure on the country.[36][109]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n111. **^** Friedman, Uri. \"North Korea's Undeserved Olympic Glory\". *The Atlantic*.

Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008. On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nEvents took place at eighteen existing venues, nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games, and seven temporary venues.[14]\n\n\nFor the events held in Rio de Janeiro, each event was held in one of four geographically segregated Olympic clusters–Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã–as was done for the 2007 Pan American Games.[15][16] Several of the venues were located at the Barra Cluster Olympic Park.[14] Nearly half of the athletes could reach their venues in less than 10 minutes, and almost 75 per cent could do so in less than 25 minutes. Of the 34 competition venues, eight underwent some permanent works, seven were totally temporary and nine were constructed as permanent legacy venues.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium\nThe Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimated the out-turn cost of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics at US$4.6 billion in 2015-dollars.

The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September, one month before the elections.[9]\n\n\nMany safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support and backing from sports media and general international media.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics (Rio de Janeiro)\n |\n| --- |\n| Barra Cluster | * Carioca Arena 1\n* Carioca Arena 2\n* Carioca Arena 3\n* Future Arena\n* Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre\n* Olympic Aquatics Stadium\n* Olympic Golf Course\n* Olympic Tennis Centre\n* Rio Olympic Arena\n* Pontal\n* Riocentro (four venues)\n* Rio Olympic Velodrome\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Copacabana Cluster | * Copacabana Stadium\n* Fort Copacabana\n* Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon\n* Marina da Glória\n |\n| Deodoro Cluster | * Deodoro Aquatics Centre\n* Deodoro Stadium\n* National Equestrian Center\n* National Shooting Center\n* Olympic BMX Centre\n* Olympic Hockey Centre\n* Mountain Bike Centre\n* Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium\n* Youth Arena\n |\n| Maracanã-Engenho de Dentro Cluster | * Estádio Olímpico João Havelange\n* Maracanã Stadium\n* Maracanãzinho\n* Sambódromo\n |\n| Football stadia | * Maracanã Stadium\n* Estádio Olímpico João Havelange\n* Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha\n* Arena Fonte Nova\n* Mineirão\n* Arena Corinthians\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Slovakia | Barra da Tijuca | Casa Eslovaca\n |\n| Tokyo 2020 | Barra da Tijuca | Casa de Tóquio 2020\n |\n| Tokyo Metropolitan Government | Paço Imperial | Casa do Governo Metropolitano de Tóquio\n |\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nThis is currently based on the schedule released on the same day as ticket sales began, 31 March 2015.[70]\n\n\n\n*All dates are Brasília Time (UTC–3)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony\n | ● | Event competitions\n | **1** | Gold medal events\n | **EG** | Exhibition gala\n | **CC** | Closing ceremony\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest venue at the Games in terms of seating capacity was the 74,738-seat Maracanã Stadium, which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals.[14] The second largest stadium was the 60,000-seat Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which hosted track and field events.[14] The athletes' village was said to be the largest in Olympic history.

The site was formerly occupied by the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet, also known as the Jacarepaguá Formula One circuit.[19]\n\n\nThe nine venues within the Olympic Park were:[20][21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese were the first Olympic Games to be held in South America,[4] as well as the first to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first summer edition to be held entirely in the host country's winter season, the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America (the second being 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, Argentina), and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.[5] These were also the first Summer Olympics to take place under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byLondon\n |  **XXXI Olympiad  Rio de Janeiro** 2016\n | Succeeded byTokyo\n |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOlympic Games\n |\n| --- |\n| * **Olympic sports**\n* **Olympism**\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 24 July 2016, the IOC rejected the IAAF and WADA's recommendations to allow athletes to compete neutrally, stating that the Olympic Charter \"does not foresee such 'neutral athletes'\" and that it was each country's National Olympic Committee decision on which athletes would be competing.[68] As a result, Russian athletes competed under the Russian flag, although they would compete under a neutral flag in the 2018 Winter Olympics following several developments concerning the doping investigation.\n\n\n\n#### National houses[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Games, some countries and continents had a national house. These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro.[69]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> Ultimately, you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people, perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense.

Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting, and Tokyo after the second (The latter city would eventually awarded the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2013). Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid, heading into the final round; the lead was held, and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** *Rio 2007 Pan Am Games Get Debriefed Ahead Of 2016 Bid*, Toronto, Canada: GamesBids, 9 March 2008, archived from the original on 23 October 2008, retrieved 5 May 2009.\n17. **^** \"An introduction to the Venues at the 2016 Rio Games\". *Rio2016.com*.

As Brasília time is only one hour ahead of the U.S. Eastern Time Zone, certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S. primetime hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. ET, 9:00 p.m. to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe urban renovation involved 700 km (430 mi) of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; 4 km (2.5 mi) of tunnels; 70 km (43 mi) of roads; 650 km2 (250 sq mi) of sidewalks; 17 km (11 mi) of bike path; 15,000 trees; and three sanitation treatment plants. As part of this renovation, a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodoviária Novo Rio, due to open in April 2016.[23]\n\n\nThe Games required over 200 kilometers of security fencing. A 15,000 square meter warehouse in Barra da Tijuca was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village. The second warehouse of 90,000 square meters in Duque de Caxias, near the roads that provide access to the venues, contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events.[18]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) National Olympic Committees at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n |\n| --- |\n| Africa | * Algeria\n* Angola\n* Benin\n* Botswana\n* Burkina Faso\n* Burundi\n* Cameroon\n* Cape Verde\n* Central African Republic\n* Chad\n* Comoros\n* Congo\n* Democratic Republic of the Congo\n* Djibouti\n* Egypt\n* Equatorial Guinea\n* Eritrea\n* Ethiopia\n* Gabon\n* The Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Guinea\n* Guinea-Bissau\n* Ivory Coast\n* Kenya\n* Lesotho\n* Liberia\n* Libya\n* Madagascar\n* Malawi\n* Mali\n* Mauritania\n* Mauritius\n* Morocco\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Niger\n* Nigeria\n* Rwanda\n* São Tomé and Príncipe\n* Senegal\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Somalia\n* South Africa\n* South Sudan\n* Sudan\n* Swaziland\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tunisia\n* Uganda\n* Zambia\n* Zimbabwe\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Americas | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Argentina\n* Aruba\n* Bahamas\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* Bermuda\n* Bolivia\n* Brazil\n* British Virgin Islands\n* Canada\n* Cayman Islands\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba\n* Dominica\n* Dominican Republic\n* Ecuador\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian mint). The medal design was unveiled on 15 June 2016. They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials; the bronze and silver medals contained 30% recycled materials. The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury. The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition, the obverse features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal. Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games' emblem.[24][25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (12)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (6)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n#### New sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 121st IOC Session\n\nIn April 2008, the IOC began accepting applications for two new sports to be introduced to the Olympic programme.

Replacing Record, the deal covers free-to-air coverage on Rede Globo, pay TV, and digital rights to the Games. In turn, Globo sublicensed partial free-to-air rights to Rede Record, along with Rede Bandeirantes. IOC board member Richard Carrión described the agreement as \"unprecedented\", touting that \"by working with Brazil's leading media organizations, we are confident that this represents a great deal for Olympic fans in the region. There will be a huge increase in the amount of Olympic action broadcast, both during and outside Games time, and Brazilians will have more choice of how, when and where they follow their Olympic Games.\"[84]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Golden Rings Awards[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOlympic Broadcasting Services served as the host broadcaster for the 2016 Games. Produced from a total of seven mobile units, OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage and 60,000 hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders. For the first time in Olympic history, digital-oriented footage exceeded the amount of television-oriented footage. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster.[81] NHK and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games, including the opening ceremony and selected events, in 8K resolution video. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Participating National Olympic Committees |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Afghanistan (3)\n* ![](image) Albania (6)\n* ![](image) Algeria (64)\n* ![](image) American Samoa (4)\n* ![](image) Andorra (4)\n* ![](image) Angola (26)\n* ![](image) Antigua and Barbuda (8)\n* ![](image) Argentina (215)\n* ![](image) Armenia (31)\n* ![](image) Aruba (7)\n* ![](image) Australia (420)\n* ![](image) Austria (71)\n* ![](image) Azerbaijan (56)\n* ![](image) Bahamas (28)\n* ![](image) Bahrain (33)\n* ![](image) Bangladesh (7)\n* ![](image) Barbados (11)\n* ![](image) Belarus (120)\n* ![](image) Belgium (104)\n* ![](image) Belize (3)\n* ![](image) Benin (6)\n* ![](image) Bermuda (8)\n* ![](image) Bhutan (2)\n* ![](image) Bolivia (12)\n* ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (11)\n* ![](image) Botswana (12)\n* ![](image) Brazil (462) **(host)**\n* ![](image) British Virgin Islands (4)\n* ![](image) Brunei (3)\n* ![](image) Bulgaria (50)\n* ![](image) Burkina Faso (5)\n* ![](image) Burundi (9)\n* ![](image) Cambodia (6)\n* ![](image) Cameroon (22)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Meet the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games mascots and help choose their names\". *Rio2016.com*.

The WHO dismissed the request, stating that \"cancelling or changing the location of the 2016 Olympics [would] not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus\", and that there was \"no public health justification\" for postponing them.[108][109][110]\n\n\nSome athletes did not attend the Games because of the epidemic.[111][112] On 2 September 2016, however, the World Health Organization reported that there were no confirmed cases of Zika among athletes or visitors during the 2016 Olympics.[113]\n\n\n\n### Environmental problems[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental issues in Brazil and Water supply and sanitation in Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Refugee Olympic team arriving in Rio de Janeiro\nDue to the European migrant crisis and other reasons, the IOC allowed athletes to compete as Independent Olympians under the Olympic Flag.

Host nation Brazil won seven gold medals and 19 medals, its best result at any Olympics, finishing in thirteenth place. Bahrain, Fiji, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tajikistan and Vietnam all won their first gold medals, as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes (from Kuwait).\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndirect capital costs were not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, for hotel upgrades, or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Rio Olympics' cost of US$4.6 billion compares with costs of US$40–44 billion for Beijing 2008 and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014, the two most expensive Olympics in history. The average cost of the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion.[80]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBarra Olympic Park\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2016 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by the number of gold medals are listed below.

Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008. On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nEvents took place at eighteen existing venues, nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games, and seven temporary venues.[14]\n\n\nFor the events held in Rio de Janeiro, each event was held in one of four geographically segregated Olympic clusters–Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã–as was done for the 2007 Pan American Games.[15][16] Several of the venues were located at the Barra Cluster Olympic Park.[14] Nearly half of the athletes could reach their venues in less than 10 minutes, and almost 75 per cent could do so in less than 25 minutes. Of the 34 competition venues, eight underwent some permanent works, seven were totally temporary and nine were constructed as permanent legacy venues.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium\nThe Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimated the out-turn cost of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics at US$4.6 billion in 2015-dollars. This figure included sports-related costs, that is, (i) *operational costs* incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, of which the largest components were technology, transportation, workforce, and administration costs, while other operational costs included security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) *direct capital costs* incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which were required to host the Games.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Carioca Arena 1 – basketball (capacity: 16,000)\n* Carioca Arena 2 – wrestling, judo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Carioca Arena 3 – fencing, taekwondo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Future Arena – handball (capacity: 12,000)\n* Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre – diving, synchronized swimming, water polo (capacity: 5,000)\n* Olympic Aquatics Stadium – swimming, water polo play-offs (capacity: 15,000)\n* Olympic Tennis Centre – tennis (capacity: 10,000 Main Court)\n* Rio Olympic Arena – gymnastics (capacity: 12,000)\n* Rio Olympic Velodrome – track cycling (capacity: 5,000)\n\n\n#### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nAs well as the Estádio Olímpico João Havelange and Maracanã and in Rio de Janeiro, football matches took place at five venues in the cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília and Manaus.\n\n\n\n* ![Maracanã Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nMaracanã Stadium  \nRio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Olympic Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2016 Summer Olympics bidding results[11]\n| **City** | **NOC** | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** |\n|  **Rio de Janeiro** |  **![](image) Brazil** | 26\n | **46** | **66** |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | **28** | 29\n | 32\n |\n| Tokyo | ![](image) Japan | 22\n | 20\n | —\n |\n| Chicago | ![](image) United States | 18\n | —\n | —\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 June 2011, it was reported on AroundTheRings.com that Roderlei Generali, the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC. This came just five months after CCO Flávio Pestana quit for personal reasons.[12] Pestana withdrew later during the 2012 Summer Paralympics, and Renato Ciuchin was then appointed as COO.[13]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOthers included lack of infrastructures, including beds for athletes and media reporters at that time.[8]\n\n\nNawal El Moutawakel of Morocco headed the 10-member Evaluation Commission, having also chaired the evaluation commission for the 2012 Summer Olympics bids, which was awarded to London, United Kingdom. The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September, one month before the elections.[9]\n\n\nMany safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support and backing from sports media and general international media.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics (Rio de Janeiro)\n |\n| --- |\n| Barra Cluster | * Carioca Arena 1\n* Carioca Arena 2\n* Carioca Arena 3\n* Future Arena\n* Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre\n* Olympic Aquatics Stadium\n* Olympic Golf Course\n* Olympic Tennis Centre\n* Rio Olympic Arena\n* Pontal\n* Riocentro (four venues)\n* Rio Olympic Velodrome\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Copacabana Cluster | * Copacabana Stadium\n* Fort Copacabana\n* Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon\n* Marina da Glória\n |\n| Deodoro Cluster | * Deodoro Aquatics Centre\n* Deodoro Stadium\n* National Equestrian Center\n* National Shooting Center\n* Olympic BMX Centre\n* Olympic Hockey Centre\n* Mountain Bike Centre\n* Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium\n* Youth Arena\n |\n| Maracanã-Engenho de Dentro Cluster | * Estádio Olímpico João Havelange\n* Maracanã Stadium\n* Maracanãzinho\n* Sambódromo\n |\n| Football stadia | * Maracanã Stadium\n* Estádio Olímpico João Havelange\n* Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha\n* Arena Fonte Nova\n* Mineirão\n* Arena Corinthians\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Slovakia | Barra da Tijuca | Casa Eslovaca\n |\n| Tokyo 2020 | Barra da Tijuca | Casa de Tóquio 2020\n |\n| Tokyo Metropolitan Government | Paço Imperial | Casa do Governo Metropolitano de Tóquio\n |\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nThis is currently based on the schedule released on the same day as ticket sales began, 31 March 2015.[70]\n\n\n\n*All dates are Brasília Time (UTC–3)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony\n | ● | Event competitions\n | **1** | Gold medal events\n | **EG** | Exhibition gala\n | **CC** | Closing ceremony\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest venue at the Games in terms of seating capacity was the 74,738-seat Maracanã Stadium, which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals.[14] The second largest stadium was the 60,000-seat Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which hosted track and field events.[14] The athletes' village was said to be the largest in Olympic history.

These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro.[69]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> Ultimately, you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people, perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense.

Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting, and Tokyo after the second (The latter city would eventually awarded the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2013). Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid, heading into the final round; the lead was held, and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** *Rio 2007 Pan Am Games Get Debriefed Ahead Of 2016 Bid*, Toronto, Canada: GamesBids, 9 March 2008, archived from the original on 23 October 2008, retrieved 5 May 2009.\n17. **^** \"An introduction to the Venues at the 2016 Rio Games\". *Rio2016.com*.

To reduce emissions, the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations, using a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in place of a larger body of flames.[36] The bronze and silver medals, as well as the ribbons on all medals, were designed to incorporate recycled materials.[24][25] The athletes were not presented with flowers during the medal ceremonies, as had been the tradition at previous Olympics (although floral displays were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations). The organizers considered the practice to be wasteful because the flowers were often thrown away and \"would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate\" if kept. The podiums were designed using materials that could be recycled to make furniture.[25][37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Best On-Air Promotion was announced next, with the BBC Sport winning with NBC coming second this time and BNT from Bulgaria finishing third. The Best Olympic Digital Service went to NBC, with ZDF and SporTV/Globosat picking up the second and third places. The Best Olympic Programme was awarded to SporTV/Globosat, while TV Globo and BBC Sport completed the podium.[85]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vinicius and Tom\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2016 Summer Olympic Sports Programme\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aquatics\n\t+ ![](image) Diving (8)\n\t+ ![](image) Swimming (34)\n\t+ ![](image) Synchronized swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (4)\n* ![](image) Athletics (47)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* ![](image) Basketball (2)\n* ![](image) Boxing (13)\n | * ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n* ![](image) Cycling (competitors)\n\t+ BMX (2)\n\t+ Mountain biking (2)\n\t+ Road (4)\n\t+ Track (10)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n* ![](image) Fencing (10)\n | * ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n* ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Golf (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (14)\n* ![](image) Modern pentathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Rowing (14)\n* ![](image) Rugby sevens (2)\n* ![](image) Sailing (10)\n | * ![](image) Shooting (15)\n* ![](image) Table tennis (4)\n* ![](image) Taekwondo (8)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn August, the executive board initially gave its approval to rugby sevens—a seven-player version of rugby union—by a majority vote; baseball/softball, roller sports, and squash were removed from contention, leaving golf, karate, and rugby sevens in the running. A final vote was held on 9 October 2009, the closing day of the 121st IOC Session. At this session, a new voting system was in place: a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two-thirds majority previously required.[51][52]\n\n\nThe 121st IOC Session decided to add rugby sevens and golf to the Rio 2016 Olympic programme.[53] The tally for rugby was 81 in favor, with eight against,[54] and golf was approved by 63 votes to 26.[55] Neither of these two sports was new to the Summer Olympics; rugby last featured in 1924, and golf in 1904.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Olympic rings displayed in Rio de Janeiro\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** \"Windsurfing restored to Brazil 2016 Olympics\". *BBC Sport*. 10 November 2012.

The estimate was that 5,000 men of the National Public Security Force and 22,000 military officers (14,800 Army; 5,900 Navy and 1,300 of the Brazilian Air Force), in addition to the fixed quota of Rio January, would act during the Olympic Games.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA number of events, most notably in aquatics, beach volleyball and track and field, were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 10:00 p.m. to midnight BRT. These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC, whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC, who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible (on 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through 2032, including US$1.23 billion for Rio 2016),[71][72] as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder Rede Globo. As Brasília time is only one hour ahead of the U.S. Eastern Time Zone, certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S. primetime hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. ET, 9:00 p.m. to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe urban renovation involved 700 km (430 mi) of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; 4 km (2.5 mi) of tunnels; 70 km (43 mi) of roads; 650 km2 (250 sq mi) of sidewalks; 17 km (11 mi) of bike path; 15,000 trees; and three sanitation treatment plants. As part of this renovation, a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodoviária Novo Rio, due to open in April 2016.[23]\n\n\nThe Games required over 200 kilometers of security fencing. A 15,000 square meter warehouse in Barra da Tijuca was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village. The second warehouse of 90,000 square meters in Duque de Caxias, near the roads that provide access to the venues, contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events.[18]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) National Olympic Committees at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n |\n| --- |\n| Africa | * Algeria\n* Angola\n* Benin\n* Botswana\n* Burkina Faso\n* Burundi\n* Cameroon\n* Cape Verde\n* Central African Republic\n* Chad\n* Comoros\n* Congo\n* Democratic Republic of the Congo\n* Djibouti\n* Egypt\n* Equatorial Guinea\n* Eritrea\n* Ethiopia\n* Gabon\n* The Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Guinea\n* Guinea-Bissau\n* Ivory Coast\n* Kenya\n* Lesotho\n* Liberia\n* Libya\n* Madagascar\n* Malawi\n* Mali\n* Mauritania\n* Mauritius\n* Morocco\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Niger\n* Nigeria\n* Rwanda\n* São Tomé and Príncipe\n* Senegal\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Somalia\n* South Africa\n* South Sudan\n* Sudan\n* Swaziland\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tunisia\n* Uganda\n* Zambia\n* Zimbabwe\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Americas | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Argentina\n* Aruba\n* Bahamas\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* Bermuda\n* Bolivia\n* Brazil\n* British Virgin Islands\n* Canada\n* Cayman Islands\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba\n* Dominica\n* Dominican Republic\n* Ecuador\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian mint).

The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury. The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition, the obverse features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal.

Replacing Record, the deal covers free-to-air coverage on Rede Globo, pay TV, and digital rights to the Games. In turn, Globo sublicensed partial free-to-air rights to Rede Record, along with Rede Bandeirantes. IOC board member Richard Carrión described the agreement as \"unprecedented\", touting that \"by working with Brazil's leading media organizations, we are confident that this represents a great deal for Olympic fans in the region. There will be a huge increase in the amount of Olympic action broadcast, both during and outside Games time, and Brazilians will have more choice of how, when and where they follow their Olympic Games.\"[84]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Golden Rings Awards[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOlympic Broadcasting Services served as the host broadcaster for the 2016 Games. Produced from a total of seven mobile units, OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage and 60,000 hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders. For the first time in Olympic history, digital-oriented footage exceeded the amount of television-oriented footage. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster.[81] NHK and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games, including the opening ceremony and selected events, in 8K resolution video. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Participating National Olympic Committees |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Afghanistan (3)\n* ![](image) Albania (6)\n* ![](image) Algeria (64)\n* ![](image) American Samoa (4)\n* ![](image) Andorra (4)\n* ![](image) Angola (26)\n* ![](image) Antigua and Barbuda (8)\n* ![](image) Argentina (215)\n* ![](image) Armenia (31)\n* ![](image) Aruba (7)\n* ![](image) Australia (420)\n* ![](image) Austria (71)\n* ![](image) Azerbaijan (56)\n* ![](image) Bahamas (28)\n* ![](image) Bahrain (33)\n* ![](image) Bangladesh (7)\n* ![](image) Barbados (11)\n* ![](image) Belarus (120)\n* ![](image) Belgium (104)\n* ![](image) Belize (3)\n* ![](image) Benin (6)\n* ![](image) Bermuda (8)\n* ![](image) Bhutan (2)\n* ![](image) Bolivia (12)\n* ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (11)\n* ![](image) Botswana (12)\n* ![](image) Brazil (462) **(host)**\n* ![](image) British Virgin Islands (4)\n* ![](image) Brunei (3)\n* ![](image) Bulgaria (50)\n* ![](image) Burkina Faso (5)\n* ![](image) Burundi (9)\n* ![](image) Cambodia (6)\n* ![](image) Cameroon (22)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Meet the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games mascots and help choose their names\". *Rio2016.com*.

While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, major cost overruns caused this figure to expand to US$51 billion, more than three times the cost of the 2012 London Olympics and even surpassing the estimated cost of US$44 billion for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The 2014 Games achieved a record broadcast audience of 2.1 billion people worldwide.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2016, an independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed allegations that the Russian Olympic team had been involved in a state-sponsored doping program, active from at least late-2011 through August 2015. The program was active during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, and athletes had benefited from the cover-up.[2][3][4] The IOC stripped thirteen medals from Russian athletes in 2017, but nine were reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, with an option for whitelisted athletes to compete independently during the 2018 Winter Olympics.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics were packaged together with broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well. Domestic broadcast rights were sold by Sportfive to a consortium of three Russian broadcasters: Channel One, VGTRK, and NTV Plus.[118]\n\n\nIn the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a new, US$4.38 billion contract with NBCUniversal, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020.[119]\n\n\nIn Canada, after losing the 2010 and 2012 Games to Bell Media and Rogers Media, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation re-gained broadcast rights to the Olympics for the first time since 2008, gaining rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games. Bell and Rogers sub-licensed pay-TV rights for their TSN, Sportsnet and Réseau des sports networks, as well as TVA Group's TVA Sports.[120][121][122][123]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Nation | Location | Name | Website\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Austria | Mountain Cluster | Austria Tirol House |  |\n| ![](image) Canada[72] | Coastal Cluster (Next to Fisht Olympic Stadium) | Canada House |  |\n| ![](image) China[73] | Zhemchuzhina hotel | China House |  |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[74] | Adler | Czech House |  |\n| ![](image) France[75] | Gornaya Karusel (Mountain Cluster) | Club France | Official website |\n| ![](image) Germany[76] | Estosadok, Krasnaya Polyana (Mountain Cluster) | German House | Official website |\n| ![](image) Italy[77] | Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster) | Italy House | Official website |\n| ![](image) Japan[71] | Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster) | Japan House |  |\n| ![](image) Latvia[78] | Radisson Hotel | Latvian House |  |\n| ![](image) Netherlands[79] | Azimut Hotel Resort (near Coastal Cluster) | Holland Heineken House | Official website |\n| ![](image) Russia[71] | Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster) | Russia House |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)\nSochi\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of Sochi on the eastern coast of the Black Sea in Europe.\n\n![](image)Sochi from space, showing locations of Olympic park and ski venues\nWith an average February temperature of 8.3 °C (46.9 °F) and a humid subtropical climate, Sochi is the warmest city to host a Winter Olympic Games.[16] Sochi 2014 is the 12th straight Olympics to outlaw smoking; all Sochi venues, Olympic Park bars and restaurants and public areas were smoke-free during the Games.[17] It is also the first time that an Olympic Park has been built for hosting winter games.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Sochi Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sochi Olympic Park\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n#### National houses[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Games some countries had a national house, a meeting place for supporters, athletes and other followers.[70] Houses could be either free for visitors to access or have limited access by invitation only.[71]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Australia, after all three major commercial networks pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Games due to cost concerns, the IOC awarded broadcast rights to just the 2014 Winter Olympics to Network Ten for A$20 million.[124][125][126]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSeveral broadcasters used the Games to trial the emerging ultra high definition television (UHDTV) standard. Both NTV Plus and Comcast filmed portions of the Games in 4K resolution; Comcast offered its content through smart TV apps, while NTV+ held public and cinema viewings of the content. NHK filmed portions of the Games in 8K resolution for public viewing.

This total is over four times the initial budget of $12 billion (compared to the $8 billion spent for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver), and made the Sochi games the most expensive Olympics in history, exceeding the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing,[10] which hosted 3 times as many events.[11] Dmitry Kozak was the main overseer for the events in Sochi.[12][13][14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA variety of concerns over the Games, or Russia's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities. Concerns were shown over Russia's policies surrounding the LGBT community, including the government's denial of a proposed Pride House for the Games on moral grounds, and a federal law passed in June 2013 which criminalized the distribution of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors.[131][132][133][134][135] Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history, with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials,[136] and Allison Stewart of the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms.[137] It was reported that Putin's annexation of Crimea may have been intended to distract local Russians from corruption stories related to the Games.[138][139]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMulti-sport event in Sochi, Russia\n\n\"Sochi 2014\" redirects here.

Fotomarka presents an opportunity to get a stylized sheet of eight souvenir stamps with one's own photos, using the services of a photographer in the office. Retropismo service allows a customer to write with their own stylus or pen on antique paper with further letters, winding string and wax seal affixing.

The torch was also passed for the first time in space, though not lit for the duration of the flight for safety reasons, on flight Soyuz TMA-11M to the International Space Station (ISS). The spacecraft itself was adorned with Olympic-themed livery including the Games' emblem. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky waved the torch on a spacewalk outside the ISS.

The ceremony featured scenes based around aspects of Russian history and arts, including ballet, classical music, the Russian Revolution, and the age of the Soviet Union. The opening scene of the ceremony featured a notable technical error, where one of five snowflakes, which were to expand to form the Olympic rings, malfunctioned and did not expand (a mishap mocked by the organizers at the closing ceremony where one of the roundrelay dance groups symbolizing the Olympic rings \"failed\" to expand). The torch was taken into the stadium by Maria Sharapova, who then passed it to Yelena Isinbayeva who, in turn, passed it to wrestler Aleksandr Karelin. Karelin then passed the torch to gymnast Alina Kabaeva. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Doping in Russia, McLaren Report, and Russia at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nFollowing the Games, reports began to emerge that the Russian Olympic team had participated in a state-run doping program, which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. These allegations first emerged in a December 2014 documentary by German public broadcaster ARD,[151] and were detailed further in a May 2016 report by *The New York Times*—which published allegations by Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory. Rodchenkov alleged that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games.[152][153] Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won in Sochi were the result of doping.[152][153][154][155]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n100. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Sochi Olympic Protests to Require Approval from Russia's Security Service\".

Cleared Russian athletes were allowed to participate as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR).[5][6] Two of them – curler Alexander Krushelnitskiy, who won a bronze medal, and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva – failed drug tests during the Games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEarlier plans also include building combined cycle (steam and gas) power stations near the cities of Tuapse and Novorossiysk and construction of a cable-wire powerline, partially on the floor of the Black Sea.[41]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in Russia\n\nThe transport infrastructure prepared to support the Olympics includes many roads, tunnels, bridges, interchanges, railroads and stations in and around Sochi.

On 1 February 2018, the CAS found that the IOC provided insufficient evidence and cleared 28 athletes from IOC sanctions. In total, Russian athletes won back 9 of the 13 medals collected. For 11 other athletes, the CAS decided that there was sufficient evidence to uphold their Sochi sanctions, but reduced their lifetime bans to only the 2018 Winter Olympics.[172] The IOC said in a statement that \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the [2018 Winter Olympic] Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\" and that \"this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n131. **^** \"Judge bans Sochi 2014 gay Pride House claiming it would offend 'public morality'\". *Inside the Games*. 18 March 2012.

The 2014 Games achieved a record broadcast audience of 2.1 billion people worldwide.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2016, an independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed allegations that the Russian Olympic team had been involved in a state-sponsored doping program, active from at least late-2011 through August 2015. The program was active during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, and athletes had benefited from the cover-up.[2][3][4] The IOC stripped thirteen medals from Russian athletes in 2017, but nine were reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, with an option for whitelisted athletes to compete independently during the 2018 Winter Olympics.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics were packaged together with broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well. Domestic broadcast rights were sold by Sportfive to a consortium of three Russian broadcasters: Channel One, VGTRK, and NTV Plus.[118]\n\n\nIn the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a new, US$4.38 billion contract with NBCUniversal, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020.[119]\n\n\nIn Canada, after losing the 2010 and 2012 Games to Bell Media and Rogers Media, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation re-gained broadcast rights to the Olympics for the first time since 2008, gaining rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games. Bell and Rogers sub-licensed pay-TV rights for their TSN, Sportsnet and Réseau des sports networks, as well as TVA Group's TVA Sports.[120][121][122][123]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Nation | Location | Name | Website\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Austria | Mountain Cluster | Austria Tirol House |  |\n| ![](image) Canada[72] | Coastal Cluster (Next to Fisht Olympic Stadium) | Canada House |  |\n| ![](image) China[73] | Zhemchuzhina hotel | China House |  |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[74] | Adler | Czech House |  |\n| ![](image) France[75] | Gornaya Karusel (Mountain Cluster) | Club France | Official website |\n| ![](image) Germany[76] | Estosadok, Krasnaya Polyana (Mountain Cluster) | German House | Official website |\n| ![](image) Italy[77] | Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster) | Italy House | Official website |\n| ![](image) Japan[71] | Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster) | Japan House |  |\n| ![](image) Latvia[78] | Radisson Hotel | Latvian House |  |\n| ![](image) Netherlands[79] | Azimut Hotel Resort (near Coastal Cluster) | Holland Heineken House | Official website |\n| ![](image) Russia[71] | Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster) | Russia House |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)\nSochi\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of Sochi on the eastern coast of the Black Sea in Europe.\n\n![](image)Sochi from space, showing locations of Olympic park and ski venues\nWith an average February temperature of 8.3 °C (46.9 °F) and a humid subtropical climate, Sochi is the warmest city to host a Winter Olympic Games.[16] Sochi 2014 is the 12th straight Olympics to outlaw smoking; all Sochi venues, Olympic Park bars and restaurants and public areas were smoke-free during the Games.[17] It is also the first time that an Olympic Park has been built for hosting winter games.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Sochi Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sochi Olympic Park\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n#### National houses[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Games some countries had a national house, a meeting place for supporters, athletes and other followers.[70] Houses could be either free for visitors to access or have limited access by invitation only.[71]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Australia, after all three major commercial networks pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Games due to cost concerns, the IOC awarded broadcast rights to just the 2014 Winter Olympics to Network Ten for A$20 million.[124][125][126]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSeveral broadcasters used the Games to trial the emerging ultra high definition television (UHDTV) standard. Both NTV Plus and Comcast filmed portions of the Games in 4K resolution; Comcast offered its content through smart TV apps, while NTV+ held public and cinema viewings of the content. NHK filmed portions of the Games in 8K resolution for public viewing. Olympic sponsor Panasonic filmed the opening ceremony in 4K.[127][128][129][130]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| IOC | * Charter\n* Olympic Congress\n* IOC meetings\n* International sports federations\n |\n| Medals | * Medal table\n* All-time medal table\n\t+ youth\n* Medal table leaders by Olympic Games\n* Medalists\n\t+ youth\n* Medal ties\n* Incentives by country\n* Stripped medals\n* Olympic diploma\n* Olive wreath\n |\n| Nations | * Summer Olympics\n* Winter Olympics\n\t+ tropical nations\n\t+ country codes\n |\n| Host cities | * Bids\n\t+ youth\n* Venues\n\t+ youth\n\t+ Olympic Stadium\n |\n| Ceremonies | * People who opened the Olympics\n* Torch relays\n\t+ lighters of the Olympic cauldron\n* Keepers of the Olympic flag\n |\n| Media | * Television\n\t+ Olympic Broadcasting Services\n\t+ Olympic Channel\n* Social media\n* Films\n\t+ summer\n\t+ winter\n* Video games\n |\n| Symbols | * Flame\n* Olympiad\n* Oath\n* Songs and anthems\n\t+ Hymn\n* Emblem\n* Poster\n* Mascots\n* Coins\n\t+ summer\n\t+ winter\n* Pierre de Coubertin medal\n* Olympic Cup\n* Olympic Diploma of Merit\n* Olympic Laurel\n* Olympic Order\n |\n| Other | * Art competitions at the Olympics\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of October 2013, the estimated combined cost of the 2014 Winter Olympics had topped US$51 billion.[9] This amount included the cost for Olympic games themselves and cost of Sochi infrastructural projects (roads, railroads, power plants). This total is over four times the initial budget of $12 billion (compared to the $8 billion spent for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver), and made the Sochi games the most expensive Olympics in history, exceeding the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing,[10] which hosted 3 times as many events.[11] Dmitry Kozak was the main overseer for the events in Sochi.[12][13][14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA variety of concerns over the Games, or Russia's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities. Concerns were shown over Russia's policies surrounding the LGBT community, including the government's denial of a proposed Pride House for the Games on moral grounds, and a federal law passed in June 2013 which criminalized the distribution of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors.[131][132][133][134][135] Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history, with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials,[136] and Allison Stewart of the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms.[137] It was reported that Putin's annexation of Crimea may have been intended to distract local Russians from corruption stories related to the Games.[138][139]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMulti-sport event in Sochi, Russia\n\n\"Sochi 2014\" redirects here.

The media center was built at total cost of 17 million rubles.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Power infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Night view of Sochi during the Olympics, taken by Expedition 38 members from the International Space Station\nA five-year strategy for increasing the power supply of the Sochi region was presented by Russian energy experts during a seminar on 29 May 2009, held by the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee, and attended by International Olympic Committee (IOC) experts and officials from the Russian Ministry of Regional Development, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the State Corporation Olimpstroy and the Krasnodar Krai administration.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe closing ceremony was held on 23 February 2014 between 20:14 MSK (UTC+4) and 22:25 MSK (UTC+4) at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi.[94]\nThe ceremony was dedicated to Russian culture featuring world-renowned Russian stars like conductor and violinist Yuri Bashmet, conductor Valery Gergiev, pianist Denis Matsuev, singer Hibla Gerzmava and violinist Tatiana Samouil. These artists were joined by performers from the Bolshoi and Mariinsky theaters.\n\n\n\n## Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2014 Winter Olympics\nMain article: List of 2014 Winter Olympics medal winners\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics was held on 7 February 2014 at Fisht Olympic Stadium, an indoor arena built specifically for the ceremonies. The ceremony featured scenes based around aspects of Russian history and arts, including ballet, classical music, the Russian Revolution, and the age of the Soviet Union. The opening scene of the ceremony featured a notable technical error, where one of five snowflakes, which were to expand to form the Olympic rings, malfunctioned and did not expand (a mishap mocked by the organizers at the closing ceremony where one of the roundrelay dance groups symbolizing the Olympic rings \"failed\" to expand). The torch was taken into the stadium by Maria Sharapova, who then passed it to Yelena Isinbayeva who, in turn, passed it to wrestler Aleksandr Karelin. Karelin then passed the torch to gymnast Alina Kabaeva. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Doping in Russia, McLaren Report, and Russia at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nFollowing the Games, reports began to emerge that the Russian Olympic team had participated in a state-run doping program, which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. These allegations first emerged in a December 2014 documentary by German public broadcaster ARD,[151] and were detailed further in a May 2016 report by *The New York Times*—which published allegations by Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory. Rodchenkov alleged that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games.[152][153] Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won in Sochi were the result of doping.[152][153][154][155]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n100. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Sochi Olympic Protests to Require Approval from Russia's Security Service\".

On 1 February 2018, the CAS found that the IOC provided insufficient evidence and cleared 28 athletes from IOC sanctions. In total, Russian athletes won back 9 of the 13 medals collected. For 11 other athletes, the CAS decided that there was sufficient evidence to uphold their Sochi sanctions, but reduced their lifetime bans to only the 2018 Winter Olympics.[172] The IOC said in a statement that \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the [2018 Winter Olympic] Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\" and that \"this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n131. **^** \"Judge bans Sochi 2014 gay Pride House claiming it would offend 'public morality'\". *Inside the Games*. 18 March 2012.

London was close behind, having closed most of the gap observed by the initial evaluation in 2004. New York and Madrid also received very positive evaluations.[30] On 1 July 2005, when asked who would win, Jacques Rogge said, \"I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close.

The Olympic laboratory tested up to 400 samples every day for more than 240 prohibited substances.[215] As of late 2022, 40 medals have been stripped due to doping violations, 17 of which were originally awarded to Russian athletes. Testing for drugs was completed by GSK (GlaxoSmithKline).[216]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| IOC | * Charter\n* Olympic Congress\n* IOC meetings\n* International sports federations\n |\n| Medals | * Medal table\n* All-time medal table\n\t+ youth\n* Medal table leaders by Olympic Games\n* Medalists\n\t+ youth\n* Medal ties\n* Incentives by country\n* Stripped medals\n* Olympic diploma\n* Olive wreath\n |\n| Nations | * Summer Olympics\n* Winter Olympics\n\t+ tropical nations\n\t+ country codes\n |\n| Host cities | * Bids\n\t+ youth\n* Venues\n\t+ youth\n\t+ Olympic Stadium\n |\n| Ceremonies | * People who opened the Olympics\n* Torch relays\n\t+ lighters of the Olympic cauldron\n* Keepers of the Olympic flag\n |\n| Media | * Television\n\t+ Olympic Broadcasting Services\n\t+ Olympic Channel\n* Social media\n* Films\n\t+ summer\n\t+ winter\n* Video games\n |\n| Symbols | * Flame\n* Olympiad\n* Oath\n* Songs and anthems\n\t+ Hymn\n* Emblem\n* Poster\n* Mascots\n* Coins\n\t+ summer\n\t+ winter\n* Pierre de Coubertin medal\n* Olympic Cup\n* Olympic Diploma of Merit\n* Olympic Laurel\n* Olympic Order\n |\n| Other | * Art competitions at the Olympics\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe IOC wanted television coverage to reach as broad a worldwide audience as possible, and several national and regional broadcasters covered London 2012. In the UK, the BBC carried the Olympics and Channel 4 the Paralympics. The BBC aimed to broadcast all 5,000 hours of the Games.[168] BBC Parliament's Freeview channel was suspended, BBC Three's on-air time was extended so that it could show Olympic events in the daytime, and 24 additional BBC Olympics channels were available via cable, satellite and the internet in the UK.\n\n\nThe US television rights, owned by NBC, accounted for more than half the rights revenue for the IOC. Despite high viewership, many viewers were disappointed with NBC's coverage.[169] The operations of broadcasters granted rights to the Games were hosted in the dedicated International Broadcast Centre inside the security cordon of the Olympic Park. YouTube planned to stream the Games in 64 territories in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa where there were no official broadcasters.[170]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTrebor and Westfield Group.[201] The companies provided £1.4 billion of funding altogether, allocated evenly between the IOC and LOCOG.[201]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Controversies at the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nDuring the lead-up to the Games, there were controversies over sponsorship,[202] the athletes' use of social media, and several political issues. After a complicated lottery process, thousands of people failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but a large number of empty seats were observed throughout the Games, even at some of the most popular events. There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received.[87]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (104). China finished second with a total of 91 medals (38 gold) and Great Britain came third with 65 medals overall (29 gold). Michael Phelps of the United States became the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, winning his 22nd medal.[13] Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Brunei entered female athletes for the first time, meaning that every currently eligible country has now sent a female competitor to at least one Olympic Games.[14] Women's boxing was included for the first time, and the 2012 Games became the first at which every sport had female competitors.[15][16][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n146. **^** \"IOC: Kuwait to compete under own flag at Olympics\". *The Mercury News*.

Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to the sailing, produced by Christopher Lincoln, Gary Milkis, and Ursula Romero. The production for the canoe/kayak slalom and the rowing/canoe sprint came second and third respectively. The award for Best On Air Promotion went to NBC with Foxtel and ZDF finishing second and third. NBC Olympics also won the Best Olympic Feature category, as Sky Italia came second and ZDF third. The Best Athlete Profile award went to TV Record's profile of Sarah Menezes, NBC came second with their profile of David Rudisha, and ESPN Latin America took third place with a profile of Miguel Correa and Ruben Rezola. The award for Best Olympic Programme went to NBC, host broadcasters the BBC took second place for Super Saturday (the middle Saturday of the Games), and third place was claimed by the Nine Network for their live coverage of Day 16 of the Games.[173]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n157. **^** \"London 2012, Athletics, 1500m Women, Results\". *olympics.com*. 7 March 2019.

Both the Olympic road races and the mountain bike event were initially considered to be too easy, so they were eventually scheduled on new locations.[49][50] The Olympic marathon course, which was set to finish in the Olympic stadium, was moved to The Mall, since closing Tower Bridge was deemed to cause traffic problems in central London.[51] North Greenwich Arena 2 was scrapped in a cost-cutting exercise, Wembley Arena being used for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics events instead.[52][53][54][55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Events at the 2012 Summer Olympics (London)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Archery\n* Athletics\n* Badminton\n* Basketball\n* Boxing\n* Canoeing\n* Cycling\n* Diving\n* Equestrian\n* Fencing\n* Field hockey\n* Football\n* Gymnastics\n* Handball\n* Judo\n* Modern pentathlon\n* Rowing\n* Sailing\n* Shooting\n* Swimming\n* Synchronized swimming\n* Table tennis\n* Taekwondo\n* Tennis\n* Triathlon\n* Volleyball\n* Water polo\n* Weightlifting\n* Wrestling\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Front of the Silver Medal won by the USA.\nApproximately 4,700[105] Olympic and Paralympic medals were produced by the Royal Mint at Llantrisant.[106] They were designed by David Watkins (Olympics) and Lin Cheung (Paralympics).[107] 99% of the gold, silver and copper was donated by Rio Tinto from a mine in Salt Lake County, Utah in the U.S.[108] The remaining 1% came from a Mongolian mine.[109] Each medal weighs 375–400 g (13.2–14.1 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 7 mm (0.28 in) thick, with the sport and discipline engraved on the rim.[110] The obverse, as is traditional, features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, stepping from the Panathinaiko Stadium that hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, with Parthenon in the background; the reverse features the Games logo, the River Thames and a series of lines representing \"the energy of athletes and a sense of pulling together\".[111] The medals were transferred to the Tower of London vaults on 2 July 2012 for storage.[110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOrganisers estimated that some 8 million tickets would be available for the Olympic Games,[84] and 1.5 million tickets for the Paralympic Games.[84] LOCOG aimed to raise £375–£400 million in ticket sales. There were also free events such as marathon, triathlon and road cycling,[85] although, for the first time in Olympic history, the sailing events were ticketed.[86] Eventually, more than 7,000,000 tickets were sold.[87] Following IOC rules, people applied for tickets from the NOC of their country of residence. European Union residents were able to apply for tickets in any EU country.[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTest events were held throughout 2011 and 2012, either through an existing championship such as 2012 Wimbledon Championships or as a specially created event held under the banner of *London Prepares*.[56] Team GB House was the British Olympic Association's operational HQ up to and during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

It was chosen to highlight the organisers' commitment to inspire the world, including younger generations, to get involved in sporting events through the Games' legacy.[181]\n\n\n\n### Logo and graphics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Here East, the former London Olympics Media Centre.

The OBS used its own cameras and crews subcontracted from other Olympic broadcasters to cover the events. The base video and audio were sold to other broadcasters, who added their own commentary and presentation.\n\n\nThe official recording format of the 2012 Summer Olympics used Panasonic's digital technologies. The official video was produced and distributed from the International Broadcast Centre in 1080/50i High-Definition (HD) format. Panasonic announced that DVCPRO HD would be the official recording format. OBS London used P2 HD shoulder-mount camcorders.[167]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ medalists\n* Scandals and controversies\n\t+ antisemitism\n\t+ colonialism\n\t+ doping\n* Deaths\n\t+ WWI\n\t+ WWII\n* Participation of women\n |\n| Related | * Paralympic Games\n* Continental\n\t+ African\n\t+ Asian\n\t+ European\n\t+ Pacific\n\t+ Pan-American\n* Olympic Esports Series\n* Deaflympics\n* Special Olympics\n* 1906 Intercalated Games\n* Ancient Olympic Games\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) National Olympic Committees at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom\n |\n| --- |\n| Africa | * Algeria\n* Angola\n* Benin\n* Botswana\n* Burkina Faso\n* Burundi\n* Cameroon\n* Cape Verde\n* Central African Republic\n* Chad\n* Comoros\n* Republic of the Congo\n* Democratic Republic of the Congo\n* Djibouti\n* Egypt\n* Equatorial Guinea\n* Eritrea\n* Ethiopia\n* Gabon\n* The Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Guinea\n* Guinea-Bissau\n* Ivory Coast\n* Kenya\n* Lesotho\n* Liberia\n* Libya\n* Madagascar\n* Malawi\n* Mali\n* Mauritania\n* Mauritius\n* Morocco\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Niger\n* Nigeria\n* Rwanda\n* São Tomé and Príncipe\n* Senegal\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Somalia\n* South Africa\n* Sudan\n* Swaziland\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tunisia\n* Uganda\n* Zambia\n* Zimbabwe\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Americas | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Argentina\n* Aruba\n* Bahamas\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* Bermuda\n* Bolivia\n* Brazil\n* British Virgin Islands\n* Canada\n* Cayman Islands\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba\n* Dominica\n* Dominican Republic\n* Ecuador\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n113. **^** \"How much is a medal actually worth?

It focused on oversight of the Games, cross-programme management, and the London 2012 Olympic Legacy before and after the Games that would benefit London and the wider United Kingdom. The organisation was also responsible for the supervision of the £9.3 billion of public sector funding.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter use, many of these materials were suitable for anaerobic digestion (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.[123]\n\n\nPost-Games, buildings like the Water Polo Arena were relocated elsewhere. Building parts like roofing covers and membranes of different temporary venues were recycled via VinyLoop. This allowed organisers to meet the standards of the Olympic Delivery Authority concerning environmental protection.\n\n\nLondon 2012 inaugurated Olympic Games guidelines that included the recycling of PVC, which was used for temporary buildings such as the Basketball Arena and for the temporary parts of permanent venues such as the Olympic Stadium.[124] In the Water Polo Arena, PVC roofing was made from recycled cushions to provide insulation.[125] Through this recycling process, the Olympic Games PVC Policy was fulfilled; the policy states:[126]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Qualification for the 2012 Summer Olympics\n |\n| --- |\n| * Archery\n* Athletics\n* Badminton\n* Basketball\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Boxing\n* Canoeing\n* Cycling\n* Diving\n* Equestrian\n* Fencing\n* Field hockey\n\t+ last men\n\t+ last women\n* Football\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Gymnastics\n* Handball\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Judo\n* Modern pentathlon\n* Rowing\n* Sailing\n* Shooting\n* Swimming\n* Synchronized swimming\n* Table tennis\n* Taekwondo\n* Tennis\n* Triathlon\n* Volleyball\n\t+ indoor men\n\t+ indoor women\n\t+ beach men\n\t+ beach women\n* Water polo\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Weightlifting\n* Wrestling\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Games were officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.[135] This was the second Olympic Games opened personally by the Queen, the first being in 1976 in Montreal, Canada. The ceremony featured a short comic film starring Daniel Craig as secret agent James Bond and the Queen as herself.[136] There was also a musical comedy item starring Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean playing along with the London Symphony Orchestra.[137] These were widely ascribed to Britain's sense of humour.[138]\n\n\nLive musical performers included Frank Turner, Dame Evelyn Glennie, Mike Oldfield, Dizzee Rascal, Arctic Monkeys, and Sir Paul McCartney who performed \"Hey Jude\" as the closing act.[139][140] Broadcast live on BBC One, the ceremony attracted a peak viewing audience of over 27 million in the UK.[141]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. **^** \"Go-ahead won for £77m relief road\". *BBC News*. 5 April 2007.

Many of these roads also contained special \"Olympic lanes\" marked with the Olympic rings—reserved for the use of Olympic athletes, officials, and other VIPs during the Games. Members of the public driving in an Olympic lane were subject to a fine of £130. Additionally, London buses would not include roads with Olympic lanes on their routes.[70][71][72] Concerns were expressed at the logistics of spectators travelling to the events outside London. In particular, the sailing events at Portland had no direct motorway connections, and local roads are heavily congested by tourist traffic in the summer.[73] However, a £77 million relief road connecting Weymouth to Dorchester was built and opened in 2011.[74][75] Some £16 million was put aside for the rest of the improvements.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n    The auxiliary colours used in the branding were dark purple, grey, and gold.

The Paris bid suffered two setbacks during the IOC inspection visit: a number of strikes and demonstrations coinciding with the visits, and a report that a key member of the bid team, Guy Drut, would face charges over alleged corrupt party political finances.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Olympic Games\n |\n| --- |\n| Summer | * 1896 Athens\n* 1900 Paris\n* 1904 St. Louis\n* 1908 London\n* 1912 Stockholm\n* 1916[a]\n* 1920 Antwerp\n* 1924 Paris\n* 1928 Amsterdam\n* 1932 Los Angeles\n* 1936 Berlin\n* 1940[b]\n* 1944[b]\n* 1948 London\n* 1952 Helsinki\n* 1956 Melbourne\n* 1960 Rome\n* 1964 Tokyo\n* 1968 Mexico City\n* 1972 Munich\n* 1976 Montreal\n* 1980 Moscow\n* 1984 Los Angeles\n* 1988 Seoul\n* 1992 Barcelona\n* 1996 Atlanta\n* 2000 Sydney\n* 2004 Athens\n* 2008 Beijing\n* 2012 London\n* 2016 Rio de Janeiro\n* 2020 Tokyo[c]\n* *2024 Paris*\n* *2028 Los Angeles*\n* *2032 Brisbane*\n* *2036*\n | ![Olympic rings](image)\n |\n| Winter | * 1924 Chamonix\n* 1928 St. Moritz\n* 1932 Lake Placid\n* 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen\n* 1940[b]\n* 1944[b]\n* 1948 St. Moritz\n* 1952 Oslo\n* 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo\n* 1960 Squaw Valley\n* 1964 Innsbruck\n* 1968 Grenoble\n* 1972 Sapporo\n* 1976 Innsbruck\n* 1980 Lake Placid\n* 1984 Sarajevo\n* 1988 Calgary\n* 1992 Albertville\n* 1994 Lillehammer\n* 1998 Nagano\n* 2002 Salt Lake City\n* 2006 Turin\n* 2010 Vancouver\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2014 Sochi\n* 2018 Pyeongchang\n* 2022 Beijing\n* *2026 Milan Cortina*\n* *2030*\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| **Youth Olympic Games**\n |\n| --- |\n| Summer | * 2010 Singapore\n* 2014 Nanjing\n* 2018 Buenos Aires\n* *2026 Dakar*\n* *2030*\n | ![Youth Olympic Games logo](image)\n |\n| Winter | * 2012 Innsbruck\n* 2016 Lillehammer\n* 2020 Lausanne\n* 2024 Gangwon\n* *2028*\n |\n| 1. **^** Cancelled due to World War I\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Cancelled due to World War II\n3. **^** Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n |\n\n |\n| * **![](image) Portal**\n* ![](image) **Category**\n* ![](image) **Commons**\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics\n |\n| --- |\n| 117th Session of the International Olympic Committee (Singapore)\n |\n| Elected city | * London\n | ![Bidding cities for the 2012 Summer Olympics.](image)\n |\n| Candidate cities | * Madrid\n* Moscow\n* New York\n* Paris\n |\n| Applicant cities | * Havana\n* Istanbul\n* Leipzig\n* Rio de Janeiro\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 6 June 2005, the IOC released its evaluation reports for the five candidate cities. They did not contain any scores or rankings, but the report for Paris was considered the most positive. London was close behind, having closed most of the gap observed by the initial evaluation in 2004. New York and Madrid also received very positive evaluations.[30] On 1 July 2005, when asked who would win, Jacques Rogge said, \"I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less.\"[31]\n\n\nOn 6 July 2005, the final selection was announced at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore. Moscow was the first city to be eliminated, followed by New York and Madrid. The final two contenders were London and Paris. At the end of the fourth round of voting, London won the right to host the 2012 Games with 54 votes to 50.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe celebrations in London were short-lived, being overshadowed by bombings on London's transport system less than 24 hours after the announcement.[33]\n\n\n\n\n\n**2012 host city election – ballot results**\n| City\n | NOC\n | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** | **Round 4** |\n| London | ![](image) Great Britain | **22** | 27 | **39** | **54** |\n| Paris | ![](image) France | 21 | 25 | 33 | 50\n |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | 20 | **32** | 31 | —\n |\n| New York City | ![](image) United States | 19 | 17 | — | —\n |\n| Moscow | ![](image) Russia | 15 | — | — | —\n |\n|  | **Total ballots** | 97\n | 101\n | 103\n | 104\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympic development\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing a bid headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe and the then-London mayor Ken Livingstone, London was selected as the host city at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore on 6 July 2005, defeating bids from Moscow, New York City, Madrid, and Paris.[6] London became the first city to host the modern Olympics three times,[7][b] having previously hosted the Summer Games in 1908 and 1948.[8][9] Construction for the Games involved considerable redevelopment, with an emphasis on sustainability.[10] The main focus was a new 200-hectare (490-acre) Olympic Park, constructed on a former industrial site in Stratford, East London.[11] The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Factsheet – Opening Ceremony of the Games of the Olympiad\" (PDF) (Press release).

The countdown to the start of the Olympics began with a ceremony for the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, Greece.[99]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Security for the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nSee also: Controversies surrounding G4S\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Date\n | Sport\n | Event\n | NOC\n | Gold\n | Silver\n | Bronze\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 28 July\n | Fencing | Women's foil | ![](image) Italy | Elisa Di Francisca | Arianna Errigo | Valentina Vezzali |\n| 9 August\n | Athletics | Men's 200 metres | ![](image) Jamaica | Usain Bolt | Yohan Blake | Warren Weir |\n| 11 August\n | Athletics | Women's 20 kilometres walk[165] | ![](image) China | Qieyang Shenjie | Liu Hong | Lü Xiuzhi |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2012 Summer Olympics broadcasters\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. **^** \"Essex venue to host 2012 biking\". *BBC Sport*. 11 August 2008.

There was an appeal, but the IOC voted to uphold the decision, and the two sports were scheduled to be discontinued after their last appearance at the 2008 Olympics.[152] The IOC then voted on whether or not to replace them; karate, squash, golf, roller sports and rugby sevens were considered. Karate and squash were the two final nominees, but neither received enough votes to reach the required two-thirds majority.[152]\n\n\nAlthough formal demonstration sports were eliminated after the 1992 Summer Olympics,[153] special tournaments for non-Olympic sports can be run during the Games, such as the Wushu tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics.[154] There were attempts to run Twenty20 cricket[154] and netball[155] tournaments alongside the 2012 Games, but neither campaign was successful.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n107. **^** \"London 2012: Olympic medals go into production in Wales\". *BBC News*. 27 October 2011.

The Olympic laboratory tested up to 400 samples every day for more than 240 prohibited substances.[215] As of late 2022, 40 medals have been stripped due to doping violations, 17 of which were originally awarded to Russian athletes. Testing for drugs was completed by GSK (GlaxoSmithKline).[216]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| IOC | * Charter\n* Olympic Congress\n* IOC meetings\n* International sports federations\n |\n| Medals | * Medal table\n* All-time medal table\n\t+ youth\n* Medal table leaders by Olympic Games\n* Medalists\n\t+ youth\n* Medal ties\n* Incentives by country\n* Stripped medals\n* Olympic diploma\n* Olive wreath\n |\n| Nations | * Summer Olympics\n* Winter Olympics\n\t+ tropical nations\n\t+ country codes\n |\n| Host cities | * Bids\n\t+ youth\n* Venues\n\t+ youth\n\t+ Olympic Stadium\n |\n| Ceremonies | * People who opened the Olympics\n* Torch relays\n\t+ lighters of the Olympic cauldron\n* Keepers of the Olympic flag\n |\n| Media | * Television\n\t+ Olympic Broadcasting Services\n\t+ Olympic Channel\n* Social media\n* Films\n\t+ summer\n\t+ winter\n* Video games\n |\n| Symbols | * Flame\n* Olympiad\n* Oath\n* Songs and anthems\n\t+ Hymn\n* Emblem\n* Poster\n* Mascots\n* Coins\n\t+ summer\n\t+ winter\n* Pierre de Coubertin medal\n* Olympic Cup\n* Olympic Diploma of Merit\n* Olympic Laurel\n* Olympic Order\n |\n| Other | * Art competitions at the Olympics\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe IOC wanted television coverage to reach as broad a worldwide audience as possible, and several national and regional broadcasters covered London 2012. In the UK, the BBC carried the Olympics and Channel 4 the Paralympics. The BBC aimed to broadcast all 5,000 hours of the Games.[168] BBC Parliament's Freeview channel was suspended, BBC Three's on-air time was extended so that it could show Olympic events in the daytime, and 24 additional BBC Olympics channels were available via cable, satellite and the internet in the UK.\n\n\nThe US television rights, owned by NBC, accounted for more than half the rights revenue for the IOC. Despite high viewership, many viewers were disappointed with NBC's coverage.[169] The operations of broadcasters granted rights to the Games were hosted in the dedicated International Broadcast Centre inside the security cordon of the Olympic Park. YouTube planned to stream the Games in 64 territories in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa where there were no official broadcasters.[170]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTrebor and Westfield Group.[201] The companies provided £1.4 billion of funding altogether, allocated evenly between the IOC and LOCOG.[201]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Controversies at the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nDuring the lead-up to the Games, there were controversies over sponsorship,[202] the athletes' use of social media, and several political issues. After a complicated lottery process, thousands of people failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but a large number of empty seats were observed throughout the Games, even at some of the most popular events. There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received.[87]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (104). China finished second with a total of 91 medals (38 gold) and Great Britain came third with 65 medals overall (29 gold). Michael Phelps of the United States became the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, winning his 22nd medal.[13] Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Brunei entered female athletes for the first time, meaning that every currently eligible country has now sent a female competitor to at least one Olympic Games.[14] Women's boxing was included for the first time, and the 2012 Games became the first at which every sport had female competitors.[15][16][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n146. **^** \"IOC: Kuwait to compete under own flag at Olympics\". *The Mercury News*.

The award for Best On Air Promotion went to NBC with Foxtel and ZDF finishing second and third. NBC Olympics also won the Best Olympic Feature category, as Sky Italia came second and ZDF third. The Best Athlete Profile award went to TV Record's profile of Sarah Menezes, NBC came second with their profile of David Rudisha, and ESPN Latin America took third place with a profile of Miguel Correa and Ruben Rezola. The award for Best Olympic Programme went to NBC, host broadcasters the BBC took second place for Super Saturday (the middle Saturday of the Games), and third place was claimed by the Nine Network for their live coverage of Day 16 of the Games.[173]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n157. **^** \"London 2012, Athletics, 1500m Women, Results\". *olympics.com*. 7 March 2019.

Both the Olympic road races and the mountain bike event were initially considered to be too easy, so they were eventually scheduled on new locations.[49][50] The Olympic marathon course, which was set to finish in the Olympic stadium, was moved to The Mall, since closing Tower Bridge was deemed to cause traffic problems in central London.[51] North Greenwich Arena 2 was scrapped in a cost-cutting exercise, Wembley Arena being used for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics events instead.[52][53][54][55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Events at the 2012 Summer Olympics (London)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Archery\n* Athletics\n* Badminton\n* Basketball\n* Boxing\n* Canoeing\n* Cycling\n* Diving\n* Equestrian\n* Fencing\n* Field hockey\n* Football\n* Gymnastics\n* Handball\n* Judo\n* Modern pentathlon\n* Rowing\n* Sailing\n* Shooting\n* Swimming\n* Synchronized swimming\n* Table tennis\n* Taekwondo\n* Tennis\n* Triathlon\n* Volleyball\n* Water polo\n* Weightlifting\n* Wrestling\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Front of the Silver Medal won by the USA.\nApproximately 4,700[105] Olympic and Paralympic medals were produced by the Royal Mint at Llantrisant.[106] They were designed by David Watkins (Olympics) and Lin Cheung (Paralympics).[107] 99% of the gold, silver and copper was donated by Rio Tinto from a mine in Salt Lake County, Utah in the U.S.[108] The remaining 1% came from a Mongolian mine.[109] Each medal weighs 375–400 g (13.2–14.1 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 7 mm (0.28 in) thick, with the sport and discipline engraved on the rim.[110] The obverse, as is traditional, features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, stepping from the Panathinaiko Stadium that hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, with Parthenon in the background; the reverse features the Games logo, the River Thames and a series of lines representing \"the energy of athletes and a sense of pulling together\".[111] The medals were transferred to the Tower of London vaults on 2 July 2012 for storage.[110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOrganisers estimated that some 8 million tickets would be available for the Olympic Games,[84] and 1.5 million tickets for the Paralympic Games.[84] LOCOG aimed to raise £375–£400 million in ticket sales. There were also free events such as marathon, triathlon and road cycling,[85] although, for the first time in Olympic history, the sailing events were ticketed.[86] Eventually, more than 7,000,000 tickets were sold.[87] Following IOC rules, people applied for tickets from the NOC of their country of residence. European Union residents were able to apply for tickets in any EU country.[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTest events were held throughout 2011 and 2012, either through an existing championship such as 2012 Wimbledon Championships or as a specially created event held under the banner of *London Prepares*.[56] Team GB House was the British Olympic Association's operational HQ up to and during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The base video and audio were sold to other broadcasters, who added their own commentary and presentation.\n\n\nThe official recording format of the 2012 Summer Olympics used Panasonic's digital technologies. The official video was produced and distributed from the International Broadcast Centre in 1080/50i High-Definition (HD) format.

It focused on oversight of the Games, cross-programme management, and the London 2012 Olympic Legacy before and after the Games that would benefit London and the wider United Kingdom.

Many of these roads also contained special \"Olympic lanes\" marked with the Olympic rings—reserved for the use of Olympic athletes, officials, and other VIPs during the Games. Members of the public driving in an Olympic lane were subject to a fine of £130. Additionally, London buses would not include roads with Olympic lanes on their routes.[70][71][72] Concerns were expressed at the logistics of spectators travelling to the events outside London. In particular, the sailing events at Portland had no direct motorway connections, and local roads are heavily congested by tourist traffic in the summer.[73] However, a £77 million relief road connecting Weymouth to Dorchester was built and opened in 2011.[74][75] Some £16 million was put aside for the rest of the improvements.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n    The auxiliary colours used in the branding were dark purple, grey, and gold.
