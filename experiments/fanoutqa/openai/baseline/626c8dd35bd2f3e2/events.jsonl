Bird was rated the greatest NBA small forward of all time by Fox Sports in 2016.[4] After retiring as a player, Bird served as head coach of the Indiana Pacers from 1997 to 2000. He was named NBA Coach of the Year for the 1997–98 season and later led the Pacers to a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals. In 2003, Bird was named president of basketball operations for the Pacers, holding the position until retiring in 2012.[5] He was named NBA Executive of the Year for the 2012 season. Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013,[6] and remained in that role until 2017.[7] Bird continued with the Pacers as an advisor until July 2022, then after nearly a year's break returned to the organization in the role of consultant.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2023: M.

He played most of his career with forward Kevin McHale and center Robert Parish, considered by some to be the greatest front court in NBA history.[2] Bird was a 12-time NBA All-Star, won two NBA Finals MVP awards and received the NBA Most Valuable Player Award three consecutive times (1984–1986), making him the only forward in league history to do so.

Celtics general manager Red Auerbach publicly stated that he would not pay Bird more than any Celtic on the current roster, but Bird's agent Bob Woolf told Auerbach that Bird would reject any sub-market offers and simply enter the 1979 draft instead, where Boston's rights would expire when the draft began on June 25, and Bird would have been the likely top pick. After protracted negotiations, Bird inked a five-year, $3.25 million contract with the team on June 8, making him the highest-paid rookie in sports history.[26][15][27] Shortly afterwards, NBA draft eligibility rules were changed to prevent teams from drafting players before they were ready to sign, a rule known as the Bird Collegiate Rule.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Early success (1979–1983)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Bird joined Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and other NBA stars to play for the United States men's national basketball team in that year's Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.[81] It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent NBA players to compete. The \"Dream Team\" won the men's basketball gold medal. In eight games, Bird averaged 8.4 points.[82] The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame called the team \"the greatest collection of basketball talent on the planet\".[83]\n\n\n\n## Player profile and legacy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the 1982 All-Star Game, Bird scored 19 points en route to winning the All-Star Game MVP Award.[41] At the conclusion of the season, he earned his first All-Defensive Team selection.[23] He eventually finished runner-up in Most Valuable Player Award voting to Moses Malone.[41] In the Conference finals, the Celtics faced the 76ers for the third consecutive year, losing in seven games.[42] Boston's misfortunes continued into the next season, with Bird again finishing second in MVP voting to Malone and the team losing in the conference semifinals to the Milwaukee Bucks.[41][43]\n\n\n\n#### MVP threepeat (1983–1986)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLarry used basketball as an escape from his family troubles, starring for Springs Valley High School and averaging 31 points, 21 rebounds, and 4 assists as a senior on his way to becoming the school's all-time scoring leader.[9][15] According to Bird, he grew up as a huge fan of the Indiana Pacers in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the 6'9 center Mel Daniels, who represented his first exposure to professional basketball.[16] Bird's youngest brother, Eddie Bird, also played basketball at Indiana State University, where Daniels would coincidentally become an assistant coach to the young Larry once he played there.[11]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBird was known for his trash-talking on the court and is remembered as one of the most notable trash-talkers of his era.[112][113] He was known for telling his opponents how and where in the court he would score against them; Xavier McDaniel recounted that Bird predicted a game-winning shot against him, then \"shot a shot right in my face and was like 'Damn, I didn't mean to leave two seconds on the clock.'\"[114] When playing against Dennis Rodman, a player known for his defensive abilities, in the 1987 Eastern Conference finals, Bird continually belittled Rodman's ability, at one point asking Chuck Daly, Detroit's head coach, to send in someone up to the task of guarding him.[115]\n\n\nAt the 2019 NBA Awards, Bird received the NBA Lifetime Achievement Award (shared with Magic Johnson).[116] Since 2022, the NBA will award the MVPs for the conference finals; the Eastern Conference Finals MVP trophy is named in Bird's honor, while the Western Conference trophy is named after Johnson.[117]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGrowing up in French Lick, Indiana, he was a local basketball star. Highly recruited, he initially signed to play college basketball for coach Bob Knight of the Indiana Hoosiers, but Bird dropped out after one month and returned to French Lick and attended a local college. The next year he attended Indiana State University, ultimately playing three years for the Sycamores. Drafted by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft after his second year at Indiana State, Bird elected to stay in college and returned for the 1978–79 season. He then led his team to an undefeated regular season. The season finished with a national championship game match-up of Indiana State against Michigan State and featured a highly anticipated match-up of Bird against Michigan State great Magic Johnson, thus beginning a career-long rivalry that the two shared for over a decade. Michigan State won, ending the Sycamores' undefeated streak.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBefore the 1980–81 season, the Celtics selected forward Kevin McHale in the draft and acquired center Robert Parish from the Golden State Warriors,[33][34] forming a Hall of Fame trio for years to come; the front-court of Bird, McHale, and Parish is regarded as one of the greatest front-courts in NBA history.[35][36][37] Behind Bird's leadership and Boston's upgraded roster, the Celtics again advanced to the conference finals for a rematch with the 76ers.[38] Boston fell behind 3–1 to start the series but won the next three games to advance to the Finals against the Houston Rockets,[39] winning in six games and earning Bird his first championship.[38] He averaged 21.9 points, 14 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the postseason and 15.3 points, 15.3 rebounds, and 7 assists per game for the Finals.[23][40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_vOQeaY6Nx0nUZ6EMf9wiDjd9","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Bird was rated the greatest NBA small forward of all time by Fox Sports in 2016.[4] After retiring as a player, Bird served as head coach of the Indiana Pacers from 1997 to 2000. He was named NBA Coach of the Year for the 1997–98 season and later led the Pacers to a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals. In 2003, Bird was named president of basketball operations for the Pacers, holding the position until retiring in 2012.[5] He was named NBA Executive of the Year for the 2012 season. Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013,[6] and remained in that role until 2017.[7] Bird continued with the Pacers as an advisor until July 2022, then after nearly a year's break returned to the organization in the role of consultant.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2023: M.

Celtics general manager Red Auerbach publicly stated that he would not pay Bird more than any Celtic on the current roster, but Bird's agent Bob Woolf told Auerbach that Bird would reject any sub-market offers and simply enter the 1979 draft instead, where Boston's rights would expire when the draft began on June 25, and Bird would have been the likely top pick. After protracted negotiations, Bird inked a five-year, $3.25 million contract with the team on June 8, making him the highest-paid rookie in sports history.[26][15][27] Shortly afterwards, NBA draft eligibility rules were changed to prevent teams from drafting players before they were ready to sign, a rule known as the Bird Collegiate Rule.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Early success (1979–1983)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Bird joined Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and other NBA stars to play for the United States men's national basketball team in that year's Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.[81] It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent NBA players to compete. The \"Dream Team\" won the men's basketball gold medal. In eight games, Bird averaged 8.4 points.[82] The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame called the team \"the greatest collection of basketball talent on the planet\".[83]\n\n\n\n## Player profile and legacy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the 1982 All-Star Game, Bird scored 19 points en route to winning the All-Star Game MVP Award.[41] At the conclusion of the season, he earned his first All-Defensive Team selection.[23] He eventually finished runner-up in Most Valuable Player Award voting to Moses Malone.[41] In the Conference finals, the Celtics faced the 76ers for the third consecutive year, losing in seven games.[42] Boston's misfortunes continued into the next season, with Bird again finishing second in MVP voting to Malone and the team losing in the conference semifinals to the Milwaukee Bucks.[41][43]\n\n\n\n#### MVP threepeat (1983–1986)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLarry used basketball as an escape from his family troubles, starring for Springs Valley High School and averaging 31 points, 21 rebounds, and 4 assists as a senior on his way to becoming the school's all-time scoring leader.[9][15] According to Bird, he grew up as a huge fan of the Indiana Pacers in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the 6'9 center Mel Daniels, who represented his first exposure to professional basketball.[16] Bird's youngest brother, Eddie Bird, also played basketball at Indiana State University, where Daniels would coincidentally become an assistant coach to the young Larry once he played there.[11]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBird was known for his trash-talking on the court and is remembered as one of the most notable trash-talkers of his era.[112][113] He was known for telling his opponents how and where in the court he would score against them; Xavier McDaniel recounted that Bird predicted a game-winning shot against him, then \"shot a shot right in my face and was like 'Damn, I didn't mean to leave two seconds on the clock.'\"[114] When playing against Dennis Rodman, a player known for his defensive abilities, in the 1987 Eastern Conference finals, Bird continually belittled Rodman's ability, at one point asking Chuck Daly, Detroit's head coach, to send in someone up to the task of guarding him.[115]\n\n\nAt the 2019 NBA Awards, Bird received the NBA Lifetime Achievement Award (shared with Magic Johnson).[116] Since 2022, the NBA will award the MVPs for the conference finals; the Eastern Conference Finals MVP trophy is named in Bird's honor, while the Western Conference trophy is named after Johnson.[117]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGrowing up in French Lick, Indiana, he was a local basketball star. Highly recruited, he initially signed to play college basketball for coach Bob Knight of the Indiana Hoosiers, but Bird dropped out after one month and returned to French Lick and attended a local college. The next year he attended Indiana State University, ultimately playing three years for the Sycamores. Drafted by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft after his second year at Indiana State, Bird elected to stay in college and returned for the 1978–79 season. He then led his team to an undefeated regular season. The season finished with a national championship game match-up of Indiana State against Michigan State and featured a highly anticipated match-up of Bird against Michigan State great Magic Johnson, thus beginning a career-long rivalry that the two shared for over a decade. Michigan State won, ending the Sycamores' undefeated streak.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBefore the 1980–81 season, the Celtics selected forward Kevin McHale in the draft and acquired center Robert Parish from the Golden State Warriors,[33][34] forming a Hall of Fame trio for years to come; the front-court of Bird, McHale, and Parish is regarded as one of the greatest front-courts in NBA history.[35][36][37] Behind Bird's leadership and Boston's upgraded roster, the Celtics again advanced to the conference finals for a rematch with the 76ers.[38] Boston fell behind 3–1 to start the series but won the next three games to advance to the Finals against the Houston Rockets,[39] winning in six games and earning Bird his first championship.[38] He averaged 21.9 points, 14 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the postseason and 15.3 points, 15.3 rebounds, and 7 assists per game for the Finals.[23][40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_vOQeaY6Nx0nUZ6EMf9wiDjd9","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He played one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns and was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise, which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008, before signing with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, winning consecutive NBA championships and NBA Finals MVP Awards in 2017 and 2018. After sustaining an Achilles injury in the 2019 finals, he joined the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent that summer. Following disagreements with the Nets' front office, he requested a trade during the 2022 offseason and was traded to the Suns in 2023. He is regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history.[1][2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** \"Kevin Durant's last-second jumper lifts Thunder by Mavs in Game 1\". *ESPN*.

In college, he won numerous year-end awards and became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. As a professional, he has won two NBA championships, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, two Finals MVP Awards, two NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Awards, four NBA scoring titles, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, been named to ten All-NBA teams (including six First Teams), and selected 13 times as an NBA All-Star. In 2021, Durant was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[4] As a member of the U.S. men's national team, Durant has won three gold medals in the Olympics (2012, 2016, and 2020) and is the leading scorer in Team USA's men's Olympic basketball history. He also won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### Final seasons with the Thunder (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant guards LeBron James in January 2015.\nPrior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Durant was diagnosed with a Jones fracture in his right foot and was ruled out for six to eight weeks.[78] He subsequently missed the first 17 games of the year, making his season debut for the Thunder on December 2 against the New Orleans Pelicans.[79] On December 18, he injured his ankle against the Golden State Warriors,[80] returning to action on December 31 against the Phoenix Suns to score a season-high 44 points.[81] He then sprained his left big toe in late January.[82] On February 22, he was sidelined again after undergoing a minor procedure to help reduce pain and discomfort in his surgically repaired right foot,[83] and on March 27, he was officially ruled out for the rest of the season after deciding to undergo foot surgery.[84] In just 27 games, he averaged 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOff the court, Durant is one of the highest-earning basketball players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In recent years, he has contributed to *The Players' Tribune* as both a photographer and writer. In 2012, he ventured into acting, appearing in the film *Thunderstruck*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDurant was born on September 29, 1988, in Washington, D.C.,[5] to Wanda (*née* Durant) and Wayne Pratt. When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family; Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced, and Durant's grandmother Barbara Davis helped raise him. By age 13, his father reentered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments.[6][7] Durant has a sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Nets closed out a 102–101 victory for their 18th win in 20 games.[196] On January 26, Durant was named an Eastern Conference starter for the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, marking his 13th overall selection and 11th as a starter.[197]\n\n\n\n### Phoenix Suns (2023–present)[edit]\n\n\n#### 55–40–90 season (2023)[edit]\n\n\nOn February 9, 2023, the Nets traded Durant, along with T. J. Warren, to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Jae Crowder, four unprotected first-round picks, and a 2028 first-round pick swap.[198] Although Durant wanted to continue wearing No. 7 as he did in Brooklyn, the number was retired by the Suns in honor of Kevin Johnson. As a result, Durant announced that he would return to wearing the No. 35 jersey, which he had worn throughout his college and professional career prior to joining the Nets.[199]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Naismith College Player of the Year: 2007[311]\n* NABC Division I Player of the Year: 2007[29]\n* Oscar Robertson Trophy: 2007[30]\n* Adolph Rupp Trophy: 2007[31]\n* John R.

In college, he won numerous year-end awards and became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. As a professional, he has won two NBA championships, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, two Finals MVP Awards, two NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Awards, four NBA scoring titles, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, been named to ten All-NBA teams (including six First Teams), and selected 13 times as an NBA All-Star. In 2021, Durant was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[4] As a member of the U.S. men's national team, Durant has won three gold medals in the Olympics (2012, 2016, and 2020) and is the leading scorer in Team USA's men's Olympic basketball history. He also won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### Final seasons with the Thunder (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant guards LeBron James in January 2015.\nPrior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Durant was diagnosed with a Jones fracture in his right foot and was ruled out for six to eight weeks.[78] He subsequently missed the first 17 games of the year, making his season debut for the Thunder on December 2 against the New Orleans Pelicans.[79] On December 18, he injured his ankle against the Golden State Warriors,[80] returning to action on December 31 against the Phoenix Suns to score a season-high 44 points.[81] He then sprained his left big toe in late January.[82] On February 22, he was sidelined again after undergoing a minor procedure to help reduce pain and discomfort in his surgically repaired right foot,[83] and on March 27, he was officially ruled out for the rest of the season after deciding to undergo foot surgery.[84] In just 27 games, he averaged 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOff the court, Durant is one of the highest-earning basketball players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In recent years, he has contributed to *The Players' Tribune* as both a photographer and writer. In 2012, he ventured into acting, appearing in the film *Thunderstruck*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDurant was born on September 29, 1988, in Washington, D.C.,[5] to Wanda (*née* Durant) and Wayne Pratt. When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family; Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced, and Durant's grandmother Barbara Davis helped raise him. By age 13, his father reentered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments.[6][7] Durant has a sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Nets closed out a 102–101 victory for their 18th win in 20 games.[196] On January 26, Durant was named an Eastern Conference starter for the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, marking his 13th overall selection and 11th as a starter.[197]\n\n\n\n### Phoenix Suns (2023–present)[edit]\n\n\n#### 55–40–90 season (2023)[edit]\n\n\nOn February 9, 2023, the Nets traded Durant, along with T. J. Warren, to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Jae Crowder, four unprotected first-round picks, and a 2028 first-round pick swap.[198] Although Durant wanted to continue wearing No. 7 as he did in Brooklyn, the number was retired by the Suns in honor of Kevin Johnson. As a result, Durant announced that he would return to wearing the No. 35 jersey, which he had worn throughout his college and professional career prior to joining the Nets.[199]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Naismith College Player of the Year: 2007[311]\n* NABC Division I Player of the Year: 2007[29]\n* Oscar Robertson Trophy: 2007[30]\n* Adolph Rupp Trophy: 2007[31]\n* John R.

Erving helped legitimize the American Basketball Association (ABA),[1] and he was the best-known player in that league when it merged into the National Basketball Association (NBA) after the 1975–1976 season.\n\n\nErving won three championships, four Most Valuable Player awards, and three scoring titles with the ABA's Virginia Squires and New York Nets (now the NBA's Brooklyn Nets) and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers. During his 16 seasons as a player, none of his teams ever missed the postseason. He is the eighth-highest scorer in ABA/NBA history with 30,026 points (NBA and ABA combined). He was well known for slam dunking from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests and was the only player voted Most Valuable Player in both the ABA and the NBA. The basketball slang of being posterized was first coined to describe his moves. In 1993, Erving was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. In 1994, Erving was named by *Sports Illustrated* as one of the 40 most important athletes of all time. In 1996, Erving was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team.[2] In 2004, he was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame. In October 2021, Erving was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[3]\n\n\nMany consider him one of the most talented players in the history of the NBA; he is widely acknowledged as one of the game's best dunkers. While Connie Hawkins, \"Jumping\" Johnny Green, Elgin Baylor, Jim Pollard, and Gus Johnson performed spectacular dunks before Erving's time, Erving brought the practice into the mainstream.[4] His signature was the slam dunk, since incorporated into the vernacular and basic skill set of the game in the same manner as the crossover dribble and the no look pass. Before Erving, dunking was a practice most commonly used by the big men, usually standing close to the hoop, to show their brutal strength which was seen as style over substance, even unsportsmanlike, by many purists of the game;[5] however, the way Erving utilized the dunk more as a high-percentage shot made at the end of maneuvers generally starting well away from the basket and not necessarily a show of force helped to make the shot an acceptable tactic, especially in trying to avoid a blocked shot.[6] Although the slam dunk is still widely used as a show of power, a method of intimidation, and a way to fire up a team and spectators, Erving demonstrated that there can be great artistry and grace in slamming the ball into the hoop, particularly after a launch several feet from that target.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nErving was born February 22, 1950, in East Meadow, on Long Island,[8][9][10] and raised from the age of 13 in Roosevelt, New York. Prior to that, he lived in nearby Hempstead. He attended Roosevelt High School and played for its basketball team. He received the nickname \"Doctor\" or \"Dr. J\" from a high school friend named Leon Saunders. He explains: \"I started calling [Saunders] 'the professor', and he started calling me 'the doctor'. So it was just between us...we were buddies, we had our nicknames and we would roll with the nicknames. ... And that's where it came from.\"[11]\n\n\nErving recalled that \"later on, in the Rucker Park league in Harlem, when people started calling me 'Black Moses' and 'Houdini', I told them if they wanted to call me anything, call me 'Doctor'\".[12] Over time, the nickname evolved into \"Dr. Julius\" and finally \"Dr. J.\"[13] Erving was first called \"Dr. J\" by his friend and future teammate on the Nets and Squires, Willie Sojourner.[14]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Erving at Massachusetts, c. 1970–71\nErving enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1968. In two varsity college basketball seasons, he averaged 26.3 points[15] and 20.2 rebounds per game, becoming one of only six players[16] to average more than 20 points and 20 rebounds per game in NCAA Men's Basketball.[17] In 1968, the NCAA adopted a rule that prohibited dunking. Thus, Erving's dunking was only seen and known to teammates at practice.[18] He then sought “hardship” entry into professional basketball in 1971.\n\n\nFifteen years later, Erving fulfilled a promise he had made to his mother by earning a bachelor's degree in creative leadership and administration from the school through the University Without Walls program.[19][20] Erving also holds an honorary doctorate from UMass.[19] In September 2021, Massachusetts honored Erving by unveiling a statue outside the Mullins Center on the university's campus.[21][22]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Virginia Squires (ABA)[edit]\n\n\nAlthough NBA rules at the time did not allow teams to draft players who were fewer than four years removed from high school, the ABA instituted a “hardship” rule that would allow players to leave college early.[23] Erving took advantage of the rule change and left Massachusetts after his junior year to sign a four-year contract worth $500,000 spread over seven years with the Virginia Squires.[24][25]\n\n\nErving quickly established himself as a force and gained a reputation for hard and ruthless dunking. He scored 27.3 points per game as a rookie, was selected to the All-ABA Second Team, made the ABA All-Rookie Team, led the ABA in offensive rebounds, and finished second to Artis Gilmore for the ABA Rookie of the Year Award. He led the Squires into the Eastern Division Finals, where they lost to the Rick Barry-led New York Nets in seven games. The Nets would eventually go to the finals, losing to the star-studded Indiana Pacers team.[26]\n\n\n\n### ABA–NBA contract dispute[edit]\n\n\nUnder NBA rules, he became eligible for the 1972 NBA draft and the Milwaukee Bucks picked him in the first round (12th overall), a move that would have brought him together with Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Prior to the draft, he signed a contract with the Atlanta Hawks worth more than $1 million with a $250,000 bonus.[27] The signing with the Hawks came after a dispute with the Squires where he demanded a renegotiation of the terms.[25] He discovered that his agent at the time, Steve Arnold, was employed by the Squires and convinced him to sign a below-market contract.[28]\n\n\nThis created a dispute between three teams in two leagues. The Bucks asserted their rights to Erving via the draft, while the Squires went to court to force him to honor his contract. He joined Pete Maravich at the Hawks' training camp, as they prepared for the upcoming season. He played two exhibition games with the Hawks until NBA Commissioner J. Walter Kennedy ruled that the Bucks owned Erving's rights via the draft. Kennedy fined the Hawks $25,000 per game in violation of his ruling. Atlanta appealed Kennedy's decision to the league owners, who also supported the Bucks’ position.[29] While waiting for the owners’ decision, Erving played in one more preseason game, earning the Hawks another fine. Erving enjoyed his brief time with Atlanta, and he would later duplicate with George Gervin his after-practice playing with Maravich.[30]\n\n\nOn October 2, Judge Edward Neaher issued an injunction that prohibited him from playing for any team other than the Squires. The judge then sent the case to arbitration because of an arbitration clause in Erving's contract with Virginia.[30] He agreed to report to the Squires while his appeal of the injunction made its way through the court.[31]\n\n\nBack in the ABA, his game flourished, and he achieved a career-best 31.9 points per game in the 1972–1973 season. The following year, the cash-strapped Squires sold his contract to the New York Nets.[32]\n\n\n\n### New York Nets (ABA)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Erving in 1974\nThe Squires, like most ABA teams, were on rather shaky financial ground. The cash-strapped team sent Erving to the Nets in a complex deal that kept him in the ABA. Erving signed an eight-year deal worth a reported $350,000 per year. The Squires received $750,000, George Carter, and the rights to Kermit Washington for Erving and Willie Sojourner. The Nets also sent $425,000 to the Hawks to reimburse the team for its legal fees, fines and the bonus paid to Erving. Finally, Atlanta would receive draft compensation should a merger of the league result in a common draft.[27]\n\n\nErving went on to lead the Nets to their first ABA title in 1973–1974, defeating the Utah Stars.[33] Erving established himself as the most important player in the ABA. His spectacular play established the Nets as one of the better teams in the ABA, and brought fans and credibility to the league.[34]\nThe end of the 1975–76 ABA season finally brought the ABA–NBA merger. The Nets and Nuggets had applied for admission to the NBA before the season, in anticipation of the eventual merger that had first been proposed by the two leagues in 1970 but which was delayed for various reasons, including the Oscar Robertson free agency suit (which was not resolved until 1976). The Erving-led Nets defeated the Denver Nuggets in the ABA's final championship. In the postseason, Erving averaged 34.7 points and was named Most Valuable Player of the playoffs. That season, he finished in the top 10 in the ABA in points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per game, blocks per game, free throw percentage, free throws made, free throws attempted, three-point field goal percentage and three-point field goals made. This is the only season in the ABA or the NBA where such a feat was accomplished.[35]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia 76ers (NBA)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

With Erving and Nate Archibald (acquired in a trade with Kansas City), the Nets were poised to pick up right where they left off. However, the New York Knicks upset the Nets' plans when they demanded that the Nets pay them $4.8 million for \"invading\" the Knicks' NBA territory. Coming on the heels of the fees the Nets had to pay for joining the NBA, owner Roy Boe reneged on a promise to raise Erving's salary. Erving refused to play under these conditions and held out in training camp.[36]\n\n\nAfter several teams such as the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers lobbied to obtain him, the Nets offered Erving's contract to the New York Knicks in return for waiving the indemnity, but the Knicks turned it down. This was considered one of the worst decisions in franchise history.[37] The Sixers then decided to offer to buy Erving's contract for $3 million—in addition to paying roughly the Nets same amount as their expansion fee—and Boe had little choice but to accept the $6 million deal.[38] For all intents and purposes, the Nets traded their franchise player for a berth in the NBA. The Erving deal left the Nets in ruin; they promptly crashed to a 22–60 record, the worst in the league.[39] Years later, Boe regretted having to trade Erving to join the NBA, saying, \"The merger agreement killed the Nets as an NBA franchise.\"[40]\n\n\nErving quickly became the leader of his new club and led them to an exciting 50-win season. However, playing with other stars-such as former ABA standout George McGinnis, future NBA All-Star Lloyd Free, and aggressive Doug Collins allowed him to focus on playing more team-oriented ball. Despite a smaller role, Erving stayed unselfish. The Sixers won the Atlantic Division and were the top drawing team in the NBA. They defeated the defending champions, the Boston Celtics, to win the Eastern Conference. Erving took them into the NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers of Bill Walton. After the Sixers took a 2–0 lead, however, the Blazers ran off four straight victories after the famous brawl between Maurice Lucas and Darryl Dawkins which ignited the Blazers' team.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Erving playing against the Atlanta Hawks in 1981\nErving enjoyed success off the court, becoming one of the first basketball players to endorse many products and to have a shoe marketed under his name. He also starred in the 1979 basketball comedy film, *The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh*. In the following years, Erving coped with a team that was not yet playing at his level. It took a few years for the Sixers franchise to build around Erving. Eventually, coach Billy Cunningham and top-level players like Maurice Cheeks, Andrew Toney, and Bobby Jones were added to the mix and the franchise was very successful.\n\n\nThe Sixers were still eliminated twice in the Eastern Conference Finals. In 1979, Larry Bird entered the league, reviving the Boston Celtics and the storied Celtics–76ers rivalry; these two teams faced each other in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1985. The Bird vs. Erving matchup became arguably the top personal rivalry in the sport (along with Bird vs. Magic Johnson), inspiring the early Electronic Arts video game *One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird*. In 1980, the 76ers prevailed over the Celtics to advance to the NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. There, Erving executed the legendary \"Baseline Move\", a behind-the-board reverse layup. However, the Lakers won the series 4–2 with superb play from, among others, Magic Johnson. Erving also made the only three point shot in that NBA Finals series, which was the first time the three point line was introduced in the league.[42]\n\n\nErving was again among the league's best players in the 1980–1981 and 1981–1982 seasons, although more disappointment came as the Sixers stumbled twice in the playoffs: in 1981, the Celtics eliminated them in seven games in the 1981 Eastern Finals after Philadelphia had a 3–1 series lead, but lost both Game 5 and Game 6 by 2 points and the deciding Game 7 by 1; and in 1982, the Sixers managed to beat the defending champion Celtics in seven games in the 1982 Eastern Finals but lost the NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. Despite these defeats, Erving was named the NBA MVP in 1981 and was again voted to the 1982 All-NBA First Team.[43]\n\n\nFor the 1982–1983 season, the Sixers obtained the missing element to combat their weakness at their center position, Moses Malone. Armed with one of the most formidable and unstoppable center-forward combinations of all time, the Sixers dominated the whole season, prompting Malone to make the famous playoff prediction of \"fo-fo-fo (four-four-four)\" in anticipation of the 76ers sweeping the three rounds of the playoffs en route to an NBA title.[44] In fact, the Sixers went four-five-four, losing one game to the Milwaukee Bucks in the conference finals, then sweeping the Lakers to win the NBA title.\n\n\n\n![](image)Erving during his final season in 1987\nErving maintained his all-star caliber of play into his twilight years, averaging 22.4, 20.0, 18.1, and 16.8 points per game in his final seasons.[45] In 1986, he announced that he would retire after the season. That final season saw opposing teams pay tribute to Erving in the last game he would play in their arenas, including in cities such as Boston and Los Angeles, his perennial rivals in the playoffs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **does not include any references or sources**.

Johnny Kerr told ABA historian Terry Pluto: \"A young Julius Erving was like Thomas Edison, he was always inventing something new every night.\" He is also one of the few players in modern basketball to have his number retired by two franchises: the Brooklyn Nets (formerly the New York Nets and New Jersey Nets) have retired his No. 32 jersey, and the Philadelphia 76ers his No. 6 jersey. He was an excellent all around player who was also an underrated defender. In his ABA days, he would guard the best forward, whether small forward or power forward, for over 40 minutes a game, and simultaneously be the best passer, ball handler, and clutch scorer every night. Many of Erving's acrobatic highlight feats and clutch moments were unknown because of the ABA's scant television coverage. He is considered by many as the greatest dunker of all time.\n\n\nIn his ABA and NBA careers combined, he scored more than 30,000 points. In 1993, Erving was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and in 1996 he was inducted into the NYC Basketball Hall of Fame. When he retired, Erving ranked in the top five in scoring (third), field goals made (third), field goals attempted (fifth) and steals (first). On the combined NBA/ABA scoring list, Erving ranked third with 30,026 points. As of 2022[update], Erving ranks eighth on the list, behind only LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Dirk Nowitzki, and Wilt Chamberlain.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

Erving started by dunking two balls in the hoop. Then, he performed a move that brought the slam dunk contest to the national consciousness. He ran to the opposite end of the court and back, and dunked the basketball from the free throw line. Although dunking from the foul line had been done by other players (Jim Pollard and Wilt Chamberlain in the 1950s, for example), Erving introduced the dunk from the foul line to a wider audience, when he demonstrated the feat in the 1976 ABA All-Star Game Slam Dunk Contest.\n\n\n\n### Dunk over Bill Walton[edit]\n\n\nThis event transpired during game 6 of the 1977 NBA Finals. After Portland scored a basket, Erving immediately ran the length of the court with the entire Blazers team defending him. He performed a crossover to blow by multiple defenders, seemingly gliding to the hoop with ease. With UCLA defensive legend Bill Walton waiting in the post, Erving threw down a vicious slam dunk over Walton's outstretched arms. This dunk is considered by many to be one of the strongest dunks ever attempted,[*citation needed*] considering he ran full court with all five defenders running with him. This move was one of the highlights of his arrival to a more television-exposed NBA.\n\n\n\n### Baseline move[edit]\n\n\nOne of his most memorable plays occurred during the 1980 NBA Finals, when he executed a seemingly impossible finger-roll behind the backboard.[46][47] He drove past Lakers forward Mark Landsberger on the right baseline and went in for a layup. Then 7′2″ center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar crossed his way, blocking the route to the basket and forcing him outwards. In mid-air, it was apparent that Erving would land behind the backboard. But somehow he managed to reach over and score on a right-handed layup despite the fact that his whole body, including his left shoulder, was already behind the hoop. This move, along with his free-throw line dunk, has become one of the signature events of his career. It was called by *Sports Illustrated*, \"The, No Way, even for Dr J, Flying Reverse Lay-up\". Dr J called it \"just another move\".\n\n\n\n### \"Rock the Baby\" dunk over Michael Cooper[edit]\n\n\nAnother of Erving's most memorable plays came in the final moments of a regular-season game against the Los Angeles Lakers in 1983. After Sixers point guard Maurice Cheeks deflected a pass by Lakers forward James Worthy, Erving picked up the ball and charged down the court's left side, with one defender to beat—the Lakers' top defender Michael Cooper. As he came inside of the 3-point line, he cupped the ball into his wrist and forearm, rocking the ball back and forth before taking off for what Lakers radio broadcaster Chick Hearn best described as a \"Rock the Baby\" slam dunk: he slung the ball around behind his head and dunked over a ducking Cooper. This dunk is generally regarded as one of the greatest dunks of all time.[48]\n\n\n\n## Post-basketball career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Erving (top left) with other former NBA players visit the New York NBA Store in January 2005\nErving earned his bachelor's degree in 1986 through the University Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.[49][50][51] After his basketball career ended, he became a businessman, obtaining ownership of a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Philadelphia and doing work as a television analyst. In 1997, he joined the front office of the Orlando Magic as Vice President of RDV Sports and Executive Vice President.[52]\n\n\nErving and former NFL running back Joe Washington fielded a NASCAR Busch Series team from 1998 to 2000,[53] becoming the first ever NASCAR racing team at any level owned completely by minorities. The team had secure sponsorship from Dr Pepper for most of its existence. Erving, a racing fan himself, stated that his foray into NASCAR was an attempt to raise interest in NASCAR among African-Americans.[*citation needed*] He has also served on the Board of Directors of Converse (prior to their 2001 bankruptcy), Darden Restaurants, Saks Incorporated and The Sports Authority. As of 2009, Erving was the owner of *The Celebrity Golf Club International* outside of Atlanta, but the club was forced to file for bankruptcy soon after.[54] He was ranked by ESPN as one of the greatest athletes of the 20th century.\n\n\nIn 1991 he performed the narration in a performance of Copland's Lincoln Portrait with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Riccardo Muti in a concert to honor the 62nd birthday of the late Dr Martin Luther King. The concert was broadcast and is available on YouTube.\n\n\nErving made a cameo appearance in the 1993 movie *Philadelphia* starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, and in the sitcom *Hangin' with Mr. Cooper* in 1995.[55][56] He also made a cameo appearance as himself in \"Lice\", the tenth episode of the ninth season of the comedy series *The Office* (2013).[57] Erving appeared as himself in the 2022 movie *Hustle* starring Adam Sandler and Juancho Hernangómez.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per

He has spoken about his faith, saying: \"After searching for the meaning of life for over ten years, I found the meaning in Jesus Christ.\"[58] Erving is a second cousin of economist Walter E. Williams.[59] Erving was married to Turquoise Erving from 1972 until 2003. Together they had four children. In 2000, their 19-year-old son Cory went missing for weeks, until he was found drowned after driving his vehicle into a pond.[60]\n\n\n\n![Erving standing next to the statue depicting his likeness at the UMass unveiling ceremony in Amherst, Mass., in September 2021.](image)Erving standing next to the statue depicting his likeness at the UMass unveiling ceremony in Amherst, Mass., in September 2021.\nIn 1979, Erving began an affair with sportswriter Samantha Stevenson, resulting in the 1980 birth of Alexandra Stevenson, who would become a professional tennis player. Although Erving's fatherhood of Alexandra Stevenson was known privately to the families involved, it did not become public knowledge until Stevenson reached the semifinals at Wimbledon in 1999, the first year she qualified to play in the tournament. Erving had provided financial support for Stevenson over the years, but had not otherwise been part of her life. The public disclosure of their relationship did not initially lead to contact between father and daughter; however, Stevenson contacted Erving in 2008 and they finally initiated a further relationship.[61] Erving met Stevenson for the first time on October 31, 2008.[62] In 2009, Erving attended the Family Circle Cup tennis tournament to see Stevenson play, marking the first time he had attended one of her matches.[63]\n\n\nIn 1988, Erving received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[64] In 2003, Erving fathered a second child outside of his marriage, Justin Kangas, with a woman named Dorýs Madden. Julius and Turquoise Erving were subsequently divorced and Erving continued his relationship with Madden, with whom he had three more children, Jules Erving and two others.[61] They married in 2008.[65]\n\n\nOn September 10, 2021, Erving attended an unveiling ceremony at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for statues honoring himself and fellow UMass alumni and Basketball Hall of Fame members John Calipari, Marcus Camby, and Jack Leaman. The ceremony was attended by former teammates, coaches, family, and current players of the UMass men’s and women’s basketball teams.[66]\n\n\n\n## Community art[edit]\n\n\nFile:Dr J Mural.jpgDr. J mural on the corner of Green Street and Ridge Avenue near Spring Garden Street in Philadelphia, PA\nThe Dr. J mural is located on the corner of Green Street and Ridge Avenue near Spring Garden Street in Philadelphia, PA.\n\n\nFrom Mural Arts Philadelphia:[67]  \n\n*\"Feeling restless and desperate to improve the quality and variety of the murals, Jane [Golden] made a decision in 1990 that would forever change Mural Arts Philadelphia. She raised money from private foundation to bring her old friend and mentor Kent Twitchell to Philadelphia. She wanted a “breakthrough mural,” and Twitchell—a nationally acclaimed California artist—was just the man to paint it. “We knew we had to push the boundaries,” she said. \"The goal was to try to integrate superior artwork with a subject that touched the community in a special way.\"*\n\n\n*Twitchell was known for his portraits, and he lobbied to paint basketball great Julius Erving in a business suit instead of a uniform to portray him more as a man and role model than simply another well-known athlete. The dignified, full-length portrait is so tall that Erving’s head just fits under the peak of the three-story building. The image was first painted on large squares of parachute cloth, which were then adhered to the wall surface with acrylic gel. The cloth’s smooth surface allowed Twitchell to craft Erving with uncannily realistic detail, from the crease in his tan suit trousers to the gold bracelet on his right hand. Local residents, who maintain a small park in front of the mural, claim that the real Dr. J had tears in his eyes when he saw the completed portrait for the first time. Dr. J is also the only Philadelphia mural so respected that it appears in homage in another mural, the student-painted panorama of urban life on the Spring Garden Street Bridge.*\n\n\n*\"The mural was universally applauded. It showed that murals have the potential to be great. The level of expectation was raised,” Jane said. The mural helped alter public opinion about the program, too. “The art snobs, people who’d been looking down at our murals, started to change. There was a ripple effect—foundation and grants started to emerge.\"*\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff steals leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career steals leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Julius Erving Biography and Interview\".

Erving helped legitimize the American Basketball Association (ABA),[1] and he was the best-known player in that league when it merged into the National Basketball Association (NBA) after the 1975–1976 season.\n\n\nErving won three championships, four Most Valuable Player awards, and three scoring titles with the ABA's Virginia Squires and New York Nets (now the NBA's Brooklyn Nets) and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers. During his 16 seasons as a player, none of his teams ever missed the postseason. He is the eighth-highest scorer in ABA/NBA history with 30,026 points (NBA and ABA combined). He was well known for slam dunking from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests and was the only player voted Most Valuable Player in both the ABA and the NBA. The basketball slang of being posterized was first coined to describe his moves. In 1993, Erving was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. In 1994, Erving was named by *Sports Illustrated* as one of the 40 most important athletes of all time. In 1996, Erving was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team.[2] In 2004, he was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame. In October 2021, Erving was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[3]\n\n\nMany consider him one of the most talented players in the history of the NBA; he is widely acknowledged as one of the game's best dunkers. While Connie Hawkins, \"Jumping\" Johnny Green, Elgin Baylor, Jim Pollard, and Gus Johnson performed spectacular dunks before Erving's time, Erving brought the practice into the mainstream.[4] His signature was the slam dunk, since incorporated into the vernacular and basic skill set of the game in the same manner as the crossover dribble and the no look pass. Before Erving, dunking was a practice most commonly used by the big men, usually standing close to the hoop, to show their brutal strength which was seen as style over substance, even unsportsmanlike, by many purists of the game;[5] however, the way Erving utilized the dunk more as a high-percentage shot made at the end of maneuvers generally starting well away from the basket and not necessarily a show of force helped to make the shot an acceptable tactic, especially in trying to avoid a blocked shot.[6] Although the slam dunk is still widely used as a show of power, a method of intimidation, and a way to fire up a team and spectators, Erving demonstrated that there can be great artistry and grace in slamming the ball into the hoop, particularly after a launch several feet from that target.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nErving was born February 22, 1950, in East Meadow, on Long Island,[8][9][10] and raised from the age of 13 in Roosevelt, New York. Prior to that, he lived in nearby Hempstead. He attended Roosevelt High School and played for its basketball team. He received the nickname \"Doctor\" or \"Dr. J\" from a high school friend named Leon Saunders. He explains: \"I started calling [Saunders] 'the professor', and he started calling me 'the doctor'. So it was just between us...we were buddies, we had our nicknames and we would roll with the nicknames. ... And that's where it came from.\"[11]\n\n\nErving recalled that \"later on, in the Rucker Park league in Harlem, when people started calling me 'Black Moses' and 'Houdini', I told them if they wanted to call me anything, call me 'Doctor'\".[12] Over time, the nickname evolved into \"Dr. Julius\" and finally \"Dr. J.\"[13] Erving was first called \"Dr. J\" by his friend and future teammate on the Nets and Squires, Willie Sojourner.[14]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Erving at Massachusetts, c. 1970–71\nErving enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1968. In two varsity college basketball seasons, he averaged 26.3 points[15] and 20.2 rebounds per game, becoming one of only six players[16] to average more than 20 points and 20 rebounds per game in NCAA Men's Basketball.[17] In 1968, the NCAA adopted a rule that prohibited dunking. Thus, Erving's dunking was only seen and known to teammates at practice.[18] He then sought “hardship” entry into professional basketball in 1971.\n\n\nFifteen years later, Erving fulfilled a promise he had made to his mother by earning a bachelor's degree in creative leadership and administration from the school through the University Without Walls program.[19][20] Erving also holds an honorary doctorate from UMass.[19] In September 2021, Massachusetts honored Erving by unveiling a statue outside the Mullins Center on the university's campus.[21][22]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Virginia Squires (ABA)[edit]\n\n\nAlthough NBA rules at the time did not allow teams to draft players who were fewer than four years removed from high school, the ABA instituted a “hardship” rule that would allow players to leave college early.[23] Erving took advantage of the rule change and left Massachusetts after his junior year to sign a four-year contract worth $500,000 spread over seven years with the Virginia Squires.[24][25]\n\n\nErving quickly established himself as a force and gained a reputation for hard and ruthless dunking. He scored 27.3 points per game as a rookie, was selected to the All-ABA Second Team, made the ABA All-Rookie Team, led the ABA in offensive rebounds, and finished second to Artis Gilmore for the ABA Rookie of the Year Award. He led the Squires into the Eastern Division Finals, where they lost to the Rick Barry-led New York Nets in seven games. The Nets would eventually go to the finals, losing to the star-studded Indiana Pacers team.[26]\n\n\n\n### ABA–NBA contract dispute[edit]\n\n\nUnder NBA rules, he became eligible for the 1972 NBA draft and the Milwaukee Bucks picked him in the first round (12th overall), a move that would have brought him together with Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Prior to the draft, he signed a contract with the Atlanta Hawks worth more than $1 million with a $250,000 bonus.[27] The signing with the Hawks came after a dispute with the Squires where he demanded a renegotiation of the terms.[25] He discovered that his agent at the time, Steve Arnold, was employed by the Squires and convinced him to sign a below-market contract.[28]\n\n\nThis created a dispute between three teams in two leagues. The Bucks asserted their rights to Erving via the draft, while the Squires went to court to force him to honor his contract. He joined Pete Maravich at the Hawks' training camp, as they prepared for the upcoming season. He played two exhibition games with the Hawks until NBA Commissioner J. Walter Kennedy ruled that the Bucks owned Erving's rights via the draft. Kennedy fined the Hawks $25,000 per game in violation of his ruling. Atlanta appealed Kennedy's decision to the league owners, who also supported the Bucks’ position.[29] While waiting for the owners’ decision, Erving played in one more preseason game, earning the Hawks another fine. Erving enjoyed his brief time with Atlanta, and he would later duplicate with George Gervin his after-practice playing with Maravich.[30]\n\n\nOn October 2, Judge Edward Neaher issued an injunction that prohibited him from playing for any team other than the Squires. The judge then sent the case to arbitration because of an arbitration clause in Erving's contract with Virginia.[30] He agreed to report to the Squires while his appeal of the injunction made its way through the court.[31]\n\n\nBack in the ABA, his game flourished, and he achieved a career-best 31.9 points per game in the 1972–1973 season. The following year, the cash-strapped Squires sold his contract to the New York Nets.[32]\n\n\n\n### New York Nets (ABA)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Erving in 1974\nThe Squires, like most ABA teams, were on rather shaky financial ground. The cash-strapped team sent Erving to the Nets in a complex deal that kept him in the ABA. Erving signed an eight-year deal worth a reported $350,000 per year. The Squires received $750,000, George Carter, and the rights to Kermit Washington for Erving and Willie Sojourner. The Nets also sent $425,000 to the Hawks to reimburse the team for its legal fees, fines and the bonus paid to Erving. Finally, Atlanta would receive draft compensation should a merger of the league result in a common draft.[27]\n\n\nErving went on to lead the Nets to their first ABA title in 1973–1974, defeating the Utah Stars.[33] Erving established himself as the most important player in the ABA. His spectacular play established the Nets as one of the better teams in the ABA, and brought fans and credibility to the league.[34]\nThe end of the 1975–76 ABA season finally brought the ABA–NBA merger. The Nets and Nuggets had applied for admission to the NBA before the season, in anticipation of the eventual merger that had first been proposed by the two leagues in 1970 but which was delayed for various reasons, including the Oscar Robertson free agency suit (which was not resolved until 1976). The Erving-led Nets defeated the Denver Nuggets in the ABA's final championship. In the postseason, Erving averaged 34.7 points and was named Most Valuable Player of the playoffs. That season, he finished in the top 10 in the ABA in points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per game, blocks per game, free throw percentage, free throws made, free throws attempted, three-point field goal percentage and three-point field goals made. This is the only season in the ABA or the NBA where such a feat was accomplished.[35]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia 76ers (NBA)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

With Erving and Nate Archibald (acquired in a trade with Kansas City), the Nets were poised to pick up right where they left off. However, the New York Knicks upset the Nets' plans when they demanded that the Nets pay them $4.8 million for \"invading\" the Knicks' NBA territory. Coming on the heels of the fees the Nets had to pay for joining the NBA, owner Roy Boe reneged on a promise to raise Erving's salary. Erving refused to play under these conditions and held out in training camp.[36]\n\n\nAfter several teams such as the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers lobbied to obtain him, the Nets offered Erving's contract to the New York Knicks in return for waiving the indemnity, but the Knicks turned it down. This was considered one of the worst decisions in franchise history.[37] The Sixers then decided to offer to buy Erving's contract for $3 million—in addition to paying roughly the Nets same amount as their expansion fee—and Boe had little choice but to accept the $6 million deal.[38] For all intents and purposes, the Nets traded their franchise player for a berth in the NBA. The Erving deal left the Nets in ruin; they promptly crashed to a 22–60 record, the worst in the league.[39] Years later, Boe regretted having to trade Erving to join the NBA, saying, \"The merger agreement killed the Nets as an NBA franchise.\"[40]\n\n\nErving quickly became the leader of his new club and led them to an exciting 50-win season. However, playing with other stars-such as former ABA standout George McGinnis, future NBA All-Star Lloyd Free, and aggressive Doug Collins allowed him to focus on playing more team-oriented ball. Despite a smaller role, Erving stayed unselfish. The Sixers won the Atlantic Division and were the top drawing team in the NBA. They defeated the defending champions, the Boston Celtics, to win the Eastern Conference. Erving took them into the NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers of Bill Walton. After the Sixers took a 2–0 lead, however, the Blazers ran off four straight victories after the famous brawl between Maurice Lucas and Darryl Dawkins which ignited the Blazers' team.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Erving playing against the Atlanta Hawks in 1981\nErving enjoyed success off the court, becoming one of the first basketball players to endorse many products and to have a shoe marketed under his name. He also starred in the 1979 basketball comedy film, *The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh*. In the following years, Erving coped with a team that was not yet playing at his level. It took a few years for the Sixers franchise to build around Erving. Eventually, coach Billy Cunningham and top-level players like Maurice Cheeks, Andrew Toney, and Bobby Jones were added to the mix and the franchise was very successful.\n\n\nThe Sixers were still eliminated twice in the Eastern Conference Finals. In 1979, Larry Bird entered the league, reviving the Boston Celtics and the storied Celtics–76ers rivalry; these two teams faced each other in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1985. The Bird vs. Erving matchup became arguably the top personal rivalry in the sport (along with Bird vs. Magic Johnson), inspiring the early Electronic Arts video game *One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird*. In 1980, the 76ers prevailed over the Celtics to advance to the NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. There, Erving executed the legendary \"Baseline Move\", a behind-the-board reverse layup. However, the Lakers won the series 4–2 with superb play from, among others, Magic Johnson. Erving also made the only three point shot in that NBA Finals series, which was the first time the three point line was introduced in the league.[42]\n\n\nErving was again among the league's best players in the 1980–1981 and 1981–1982 seasons, although more disappointment came as the Sixers stumbled twice in the playoffs: in 1981, the Celtics eliminated them in seven games in the 1981 Eastern Finals after Philadelphia had a 3–1 series lead, but lost both Game 5 and Game 6 by 2 points and the deciding Game 7 by 1; and in 1982, the Sixers managed to beat the defending champion Celtics in seven games in the 1982 Eastern Finals but lost the NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. Despite these defeats, Erving was named the NBA MVP in 1981 and was again voted to the 1982 All-NBA First Team.[43]\n\n\nFor the 1982–1983 season, the Sixers obtained the missing element to combat their weakness at their center position, Moses Malone. Armed with one of the most formidable and unstoppable center-forward combinations of all time, the Sixers dominated the whole season, prompting Malone to make the famous playoff prediction of \"fo-fo-fo (four-four-four)\" in anticipation of the 76ers sweeping the three rounds of the playoffs en route to an NBA title.[44] In fact, the Sixers went four-five-four, losing one game to the Milwaukee Bucks in the conference finals, then sweeping the Lakers to win the NBA title.\n\n\n\n![](image)Erving during his final season in 1987\nErving maintained his all-star caliber of play into his twilight years, averaging 22.4, 20.0, 18.1, and 16.8 points per game in his final seasons.[45] In 1986, he announced that he would retire after the season. That final season saw opposing teams pay tribute to Erving in the last game he would play in their arenas, including in cities such as Boston and Los Angeles, his perennial rivals in the playoffs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **does not include any references or sources**.

Johnny Kerr told ABA historian Terry Pluto: \"A young Julius Erving was like Thomas Edison, he was always inventing something new every night.\" He is also one of the few players in modern basketball to have his number retired by two franchises: the Brooklyn Nets (formerly the New York Nets and New Jersey Nets) have retired his No. 32 jersey, and the Philadelphia 76ers his No. 6 jersey. He was an excellent all around player who was also an underrated defender. In his ABA days, he would guard the best forward, whether small forward or power forward, for over 40 minutes a game, and simultaneously be the best passer, ball handler, and clutch scorer every night. Many of Erving's acrobatic highlight feats and clutch moments were unknown because of the ABA's scant television coverage. He is considered by many as the greatest dunker of all time.\n\n\nIn his ABA and NBA careers combined, he scored more than 30,000 points. In 1993, Erving was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and in 1996 he was inducted into the NYC Basketball Hall of Fame. When he retired, Erving ranked in the top five in scoring (third), field goals made (third), field goals attempted (fifth) and steals (first). On the combined NBA/ABA scoring list, Erving ranked third with 30,026 points. As of 2022[update], Erving ranks eighth on the list, behind only LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Dirk Nowitzki, and Wilt Chamberlain.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

Erving started by dunking two balls in the hoop. Then, he performed a move that brought the slam dunk contest to the national consciousness. He ran to the opposite end of the court and back, and dunked the basketball from the free throw line. Although dunking from the foul line had been done by other players (Jim Pollard and Wilt Chamberlain in the 1950s, for example), Erving introduced the dunk from the foul line to a wider audience, when he demonstrated the feat in the 1976 ABA All-Star Game Slam Dunk Contest.\n\n\n\n### Dunk over Bill Walton[edit]\n\n\nThis event transpired during game 6 of the 1977 NBA Finals. After Portland scored a basket, Erving immediately ran the length of the court with the entire Blazers team defending him. He performed a crossover to blow by multiple defenders, seemingly gliding to the hoop with ease. With UCLA defensive legend Bill Walton waiting in the post, Erving threw down a vicious slam dunk over Walton's outstretched arms. This dunk is considered by many to be one of the strongest dunks ever attempted,[*citation needed*] considering he ran full court with all five defenders running with him. This move was one of the highlights of his arrival to a more television-exposed NBA.\n\n\n\n### Baseline move[edit]\n\n\nOne of his most memorable plays occurred during the 1980 NBA Finals, when he executed a seemingly impossible finger-roll behind the backboard.[46][47] He drove past Lakers forward Mark Landsberger on the right baseline and went in for a layup. Then 7′2″ center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar crossed his way, blocking the route to the basket and forcing him outwards. In mid-air, it was apparent that Erving would land behind the backboard. But somehow he managed to reach over and score on a right-handed layup despite the fact that his whole body, including his left shoulder, was already behind the hoop. This move, along with his free-throw line dunk, has become one of the signature events of his career. It was called by *Sports Illustrated*, \"The, No Way, even for Dr J, Flying Reverse Lay-up\". Dr J called it \"just another move\".\n\n\n\n### \"Rock the Baby\" dunk over Michael Cooper[edit]\n\n\nAnother of Erving's most memorable plays came in the final moments of a regular-season game against the Los Angeles Lakers in 1983. After Sixers point guard Maurice Cheeks deflected a pass by Lakers forward James Worthy, Erving picked up the ball and charged down the court's left side, with one defender to beat—the Lakers' top defender Michael Cooper. As he came inside of the 3-point line, he cupped the ball into his wrist and forearm, rocking the ball back and forth before taking off for what Lakers radio broadcaster Chick Hearn best described as a \"Rock the Baby\" slam dunk: he slung the ball around behind his head and dunked over a ducking Cooper. This dunk is generally regarded as one of the greatest dunks of all time.[48]\n\n\n\n## Post-basketball career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Erving (top left) with other former NBA players visit the New York NBA Store in January 2005\nErving earned his bachelor's degree in 1986 through the University Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.[49][50][51] After his basketball career ended, he became a businessman, obtaining ownership of a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Philadelphia and doing work as a television analyst. In 1997, he joined the front office of the Orlando Magic as Vice President of RDV Sports and Executive Vice President.[52]\n\n\nErving and former NFL running back Joe Washington fielded a NASCAR Busch Series team from 1998 to 2000,[53] becoming the first ever NASCAR racing team at any level owned completely by minorities. The team had secure sponsorship from Dr Pepper for most of its existence. Erving, a racing fan himself, stated that his foray into NASCAR was an attempt to raise interest in NASCAR among African-Americans.[*citation needed*] He has also served on the Board of Directors of Converse (prior to their 2001 bankruptcy), Darden Restaurants, Saks Incorporated and The Sports Authority. As of 2009, Erving was the owner of *The Celebrity Golf Club International* outside of Atlanta, but the club was forced to file for bankruptcy soon after.[54] He was ranked by ESPN as one of the greatest athletes of the 20th century.\n\n\nIn 1991 he performed the narration in a performance of Copland's Lincoln Portrait with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Riccardo Muti in a concert to honor the 62nd birthday of the late Dr Martin Luther King. The concert was broadcast and is available on YouTube.\n\n\nErving made a cameo appearance in the 1993 movie *Philadelphia* starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, and in the sitcom *Hangin' with Mr. Cooper* in 1995.[55][56] He also made a cameo appearance as himself in \"Lice\", the tenth episode of the ninth season of the comedy series *The Office* (2013).[57] Erving appeared as himself in the 2022 movie *Hustle* starring Adam Sandler and Juancho Hernangómez.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per

He has spoken about his faith, saying: \"After searching for the meaning of life for over ten years, I found the meaning in Jesus Christ.\"[58] Erving is a second cousin of economist Walter E. Williams.[59] Erving was married to Turquoise Erving from 1972 until 2003. Together they had four children. In 2000, their 19-year-old son Cory went missing for weeks, until he was found drowned after driving his vehicle into a pond.[60]\n\n\n\n![Erving standing next to the statue depicting his likeness at the UMass unveiling ceremony in Amherst, Mass., in September 2021.](image)Erving standing next to the statue depicting his likeness at the UMass unveiling ceremony in Amherst, Mass., in September 2021.\nIn 1979, Erving began an affair with sportswriter Samantha Stevenson, resulting in the 1980 birth of Alexandra Stevenson, who would become a professional tennis player. Although Erving's fatherhood of Alexandra Stevenson was known privately to the families involved, it did not become public knowledge until Stevenson reached the semifinals at Wimbledon in 1999, the first year she qualified to play in the tournament. Erving had provided financial support for Stevenson over the years, but had not otherwise been part of her life. The public disclosure of their relationship did not initially lead to contact between father and daughter; however, Stevenson contacted Erving in 2008 and they finally initiated a further relationship.[61] Erving met Stevenson for the first time on October 31, 2008.[62] In 2009, Erving attended the Family Circle Cup tennis tournament to see Stevenson play, marking the first time he had attended one of her matches.[63]\n\n\nIn 1988, Erving received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[64] In 2003, Erving fathered a second child outside of his marriage, Justin Kangas, with a woman named Dorýs Madden. Julius and Turquoise Erving were subsequently divorced and Erving continued his relationship with Madden, with whom he had three more children, Jules Erving and two others.[61] They married in 2008.[65]\n\n\nOn September 10, 2021, Erving attended an unveiling ceremony at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for statues honoring himself and fellow UMass alumni and Basketball Hall of Fame members John Calipari, Marcus Camby, and Jack Leaman. The ceremony was attended by former teammates, coaches, family, and current players of the UMass men’s and women’s basketball teams.[66]\n\n\n\n## Community art[edit]\n\n\nFile:Dr J Mural.jpgDr. J mural on the corner of Green Street and Ridge Avenue near Spring Garden Street in Philadelphia, PA\nThe Dr. J mural is located on the corner of Green Street and Ridge Avenue near Spring Garden Street in Philadelphia, PA.\n\n\nFrom Mural Arts Philadelphia:[67]  \n\n*\"Feeling restless and desperate to improve the quality and variety of the murals, Jane [Golden] made a decision in 1990 that would forever change Mural Arts Philadelphia. She raised money from private foundation to bring her old friend and mentor Kent Twitchell to Philadelphia. She wanted a “breakthrough mural,” and Twitchell—a nationally acclaimed California artist—was just the man to paint it. “We knew we had to push the boundaries,” she said. \"The goal was to try to integrate superior artwork with a subject that touched the community in a special way.\"*\n\n\n*Twitchell was known for his portraits, and he lobbied to paint basketball great Julius Erving in a business suit instead of a uniform to portray him more as a man and role model than simply another well-known athlete. The dignified, full-length portrait is so tall that Erving’s head just fits under the peak of the three-story building. The image was first painted on large squares of parachute cloth, which were then adhered to the wall surface with acrylic gel. The cloth’s smooth surface allowed Twitchell to craft Erving with uncannily realistic detail, from the crease in his tan suit trousers to the gold bracelet on his right hand. Local residents, who maintain a small park in front of the mural, claim that the real Dr. J had tears in his eyes when he saw the completed portrait for the first time. Dr. J is also the only Philadelphia mural so respected that it appears in homage in another mural, the student-painted panorama of urban life on the Spring Garden Street Bridge.*\n\n\n*\"The mural was universally applauded. It showed that murals have the potential to be great. The level of expectation was raised,” Jane said. The mural helped alter public opinion about the program, too. “The art snobs, people who’d been looking down at our murals, started to change. There was a ripple effect—foundation and grants started to emerge.\"*\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff steals leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career steals leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Julius Erving Biography and Interview\".

He played 14 seasons as a forward in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers. Baylor was a gifted shooter, a strong rebounder, and an accomplished passer, who was best known for his trademark hanging jump shot. The No. 1 draft pick in 1958, NBA Rookie of the Year in 1959, 11-time NBA All-Star, and a 10-time member of the All-NBA first team, Baylor is regarded as one of the game's all-time greatest players.[1] In 1977, Baylor was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[2] In 1996, Baylor was named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.[3] In October 2021, Baylor was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team.[4]\n\n\nBaylor spent 22 years as general manager of the Los Angeles Clippers, having managed the team for the majority of the Donald Sterling ownership period. He won the NBA Executive of the Year Award in 2006. Two years later, the Clippers relieved him of his executive duties shortly before the 2008–09 season began.[5]\n\n\nHis popularity led to appearances on the television series *Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In* in 1968; the Jackson 5's first TV special in 1971; a *Buck Rogers in the 25th Century* episode \"Olympiad\"; and an episode of *The White Shadow* titled \"If Your Number's Up, Get Down\".\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nElgin \"Rabbit\" Baylor was born in Washington, D.C., on September 16, 1934,[6][7] the son of Uzziel (Lewis) and John Wesley Baylor.[8] He began playing basketball when he was 14.[9] Although he grew up near a D.C. city recreation center, African Americans were banned from using the facilities, and Baylor had limited access to basketball courts growing up.[10] He had two basketball-playing brothers, Sal and Kermit.[11] After stints at Southwest Boys Club and Brown Jr. High, Baylor was a three-time All-City player in high school.[12]\n\n\nBaylor played his first two years of high school basketball at Phelps Vocational High School in the 1951 and 1952 seasons. At the time, public schools in Washington, D.C., were segregated, so he only played against other black high school teams. There, Baylor set his first area scoring record of 44 points, versus Cardozo H.S.[12] During his two All-City years at Phelps, he averaged 18.5 and 27.6 points per season.[12] He did not perform well academically and dropped out of school (1952–53) to work in a furniture store and play basketball in the local recreational leagues.[12]\n\n\nBaylor reappeared for the 1954 season as a senior playing for the recently opened all-black Spingarn High School. The 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m),[7] 225 lb (102 kg)[13] senior was named first-team Washington All-Metropolitan, and was the first African-American player named to that team.[9] Baylor also won the SSA's Livingstone Trophy as the area's best basketball player for 1954. He finished with a 36.1 average for his eight Interhigh Division II league games.[12]\n\n\nOn February 3, 1954, in a game against his old Phelps team, Baylor scored 31 in the first half. Playing with four fouls the entire second half, Baylor scored 32 more points to establish a new DC-area record with 63 points. This broke the point record of 52 that Western's Jim Wexler had set the year before when he broke Baylor's previous record of 44. However, because Wexler was white and Baylor was black, Baylor's record did not receive the same press coverage from the media, including the *Washington Post*, as Wexler's.[12][10]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baylor at Seattle\nDespite his success as a high school basketball player, no major college recruited Baylor because at the time, college scouts did not recruit at black high schools.[6] While some colleges were willing to accept Baylor, he did not qualify academically.[9] A friend of Baylor's who attended the College of Idaho helped arrange a football scholarship for Baylor for the 1954-55 academic year.[6][9] Baylor never played football for the school, however; instead, he was accepted to the college's basketball team without having to try out.[6] He outperformed the other players on the team that season, averaging over 31 points and 20 rebounds per game.[6][9]\n\n\nAfter the season, the College of Idaho dismissed its head basketball coach and restricted the scholarships. A Seattle car dealer interested Baylor in Seattle University, and Baylor sat out a year to play for Westside Ford, an Amateur Athletic Union team in Seattle, while establishing eligibility at Seattle.[14] The Minneapolis Lakers drafted him in the 14th round of the 1956 NBA draft, but Baylor opted to stay in school instead.[15]\n\n\nDuring the 1956–57 season, Baylor averaged 29.7 points per game and 20.3 rebounds per game for Seattle.[9] The next season, Baylor averaged 32.5 points per game and led the Seattle University Chieftains (now known as the Redhawks) to the NCAA championship game, Seattle's only trip to the Final Four, falling to the Kentucky Wildcats.[6][9] Following his junior season, Baylor was drafted again by the Minneapolis Lakers, with the No. 1 pick in the 1958 NBA draft, and this time he opted to leave school to join them for the 1958–59 NBA season.[6][16]\n\n\nOver three collegiate seasons, one at College of Idaho and two at Seattle, Baylor averaged 31.3 points per game and 19.5 rebounds per game. He led the NCAA in rebounds during the 1956–57 season.[17]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Minneapolis / Los Angeles Lakers (1958–1971)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (1958–1959)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baylor standing next to teammates Jerry Chambers (center) and Jerry West (right), circa 1966\nThe Minneapolis Lakers used the No. 1 overall pick in the 1958 NBA draft to select Baylor, then convinced him to skip his senior year at SU and instead join the pro ranks. The team had been unsuccessful since the retirement of its star center George Mikan in 1954. The year prior to Baylor's arrival, the team finished 19–53 – the worst record in the league – with a squad that was slow, bulky and aging. It had no permanent home arena to play in, was losing popularity, and in financial trouble. Owner Bob Short, who was ready to sell the team, believed Baylor's star athletic talents and all-around game could save the franchise. Short told the *Los Angeles Times* in a 1971 interview: \"If he had turned me down then, I would have been out of business. The club would have gone bankrupt.\"[6][18] Baylor signed with the Lakers for $20,000 per year (equivalent to $210,000 in 2023), a large sum in the NBA at the time.[9] According to basketball historian James Fisher, by virtue of his exceptional skills and his central role in the team's business plan, Baylor became the NBA's first franchise player.[6]\n\n\nBaylor immediately exceeded expectations and ultimately saved the Lakers franchise.[6] As a rookie in 1958–59, Baylor finished fourth in the league in scoring (24.9 points per game), third in rebounding (15.0 rebounds per game), and eighth in assists (4.1 assists per game). He scored 55 points in a single game,[9] then the third-highest mark in league history behind Joe Fulks' 63 and Mikan's 61.[19]\n\n\nOn January 16, 1959, Baylor refused to play in a road game in Charleston, West Virginia, after the hotel the team booked denied lodging to the team's three black players.[20] When a teammate tried to convince Baylor to play in the game, Baylor said, \"I'm a human being, I'm not an animal put in a cage and let out for the show.\"[7]\n\n\nBaylor won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and led the Lakers to the NBA finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics in the first four-game sweep in finals history,[21] kicking off the greatest rivalry in NBA history.[7][13]\n\n\n\n#### Peak years (1959–1965)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The cover of the Los Angeles Lakers program for \"Elgin Baylor Night\" on March 21, 1969\nIn 1960, the Lakers moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles, drafted Jerry West to play point guard, and hired Fred Schaus who was also the coach during West’s college career. The duo of Baylor and West, joined in 1968 by center Wilt Chamberlain, led the Lakers to success in the Western Division throughout the 1960s.[7][13][20]\n\n\nFrom the 1960–61 to the 1962–63 seasons, Baylor averaged 34.8, 38.3, and 34.0 points per game, respectively. On November 15 of the 1960–61 season, Baylor set an NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks, while also grabbing 25 rebounds. In doing so, Baylor became the first NBA player to score more than 70 points in a game, breaking his own NBA record of 64 points that he had set the previous November. Baylor held the record until 1962, when Chamberlain scored 100 points.[6][7][13]\n\n\nBaylor, a United States Army Reservist, was called to active duty during the 1961–62 season, and being stationed at Fort Lewis in Washington, he could play for the Lakers only when on a weekend pass. He was unable to practice with the team before or during the season, and had to fly coach across the country on weekends to join the team at whichever arena they were appearing. Despite playing only 48 games that season, he still managed to score over 1,800 points, averaging 38.3 points (the highest average in NBA history by any player other than Chamberlain), 18.6 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game. Later that season, in a Game Five NBA Finals victory against the Boston Celtics, Baylor set the still-standing NBA record for points in an NBA Finals game with 61.[7] Basketball historian James Fisher described Baylor's performance that season as: \"Not bad for a part-time job.\"[6] Baylor later said he \"kind of enjoyed that season.\"[20]\n\n\n\n#### Knee injury and later seasons (1965–1971)[edit]\n\n\nBaylor suffered a severe knee injury during the opening game of the 1965 Western Division playoffs, which required surgery and left him unable to play in the remainder of the playoffs. Although he scored more than 24 points in each of the next four seasons despite his injury, the limitations of knee surgery at the time and the lack of meaningful rehab left him with nagging knee problems, ultimately resulting in surgery on both knees, which impaired his playing ability for the rest of his career.[7][13][20]\n\n\nBaylor played just two games in 1970–71 before rupturing his Achilles tendon,[9] and finally retired nine games into the subsequent 1971–72 season because of his nagging injuries.[13] Baylor told the press that he could no longer play at the highest level of the sport[7] and wanted to free up room on the Lakers' roster for other players.[6]\n\n\nIn 14 seasons as the Lakers' forward, Baylor helped lead the team to the NBA Finals eight times, but the team lost each time.[13] As a result of his retirement at the beginning of the season, Baylor missed two historic achievements: the Lakers' first game afterwards began an NBA record 33-game win streak, after which they won the 1972 championship.[20] The organization awarded Baylor a championship ring despite the early retirement.[7]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1974, Baylor was hired to be an assistant coach and later the head coach for the New Orleans Jazz, but had a lackluster 86–135 record and was fired following the 1978–79 season, shortly before the team moved to Salt Lake City, Utah.[7][13]\n\n\n\n## Executive career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1986, Baylor was hired by the Los Angeles Clippers as the team's vice president of basketball operations. He was selected as the NBA Executive of the Year in 2006.[22] During his tenure, the Clippers managed only two winning seasons and amassed a win–loss record of 607–1153.[23] They made the playoffs only four times,[13] and won only one playoff series.[23] He stayed in that capacity for 22 years until October 2008.[7]\n\n\n\n## Later life and death[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009 Baylor filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against the Clippers, team owner Donald Sterling, team president Andy Roeser, and the NBA. He alleged that he was underpaid during his tenure with the team and then fired because of his age and race.[24][25] Baylor later dropped the racial discrimination claims in the suit.[26] In 2011, a jury decided in the Clippers' favor on Baylor's remaining claims, finding Baylor's termination was based on the team's poor performance.[13][27] However, Baylor felt vindicated when Sterling was banned for life from the NBA in 2014 after recordings of him making racist comments were publicized by the press.[7][13]\n\n\nBaylor died in a Los Angeles hospital of natural causes on March 22, 2021, aged 86.[19] He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills. He was surrounded by his wife Elaine and their daughter Krystle; two children from a previous marriage, Alan and Alison; and a sister, Gladys.[7][13]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\nBaylor was known as an all-around player, excelling at defense, offense, rebounding, and passing. At 6'5\", 225lbs, he was short for a forward even for the time period in which he played, but he had the strength to \"muscle through\" defenders, and the finesse and creativity to maneuver around them, including to rebound missed shots and score second chance points. \n\n\nBaylor was known for his superior leaping abilities that allowed him to score by staying in the air longer than defenders; Bill Russell called him \"the godfather of hang time.\"[7] He invented \"moves\" to deceive defenders, involving changing hands or changing direction, even mid-air. \n\n\nBaylor's offensive repertoire included a running bank shot and a left-handed hook shot, though he was right-handed. He had an on-court facial twitch that he used as a head fake. Baylor credited his success to a talent for jumping and the creativity to spontaneously react to the defense.[6][13]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A letter from California Governor Ronald Reagan to Elgin Baylor\nSince the beginning of his NBA career, Baylor has been considered one of the best basketball players in the world, and his reputation as one of the greatest in history has endured. Before Baylor joined the NBA in 1958, the league's play was methodical but mechanical, dominated by set jump shots and running hook shots. Baylor introduced a creative and acrobatic playing style that would later be emulated by other NBA superstars such as Julius Erving and Michael Jordan.[6][13] Bill Simmons wrote, \"Along with Russell, Elgin turned a horizontal game into a vertical one.\"[7] Baylor's skill was esteemed by his contemporaries: Oscar Robertson wrote Baylor \"was the first and original high flier\"; Bill Sharman said Baylor was \"the greatest cornerman who ever played pro basketball\"; Tom Heinsohn said, \"Baylor as forward beats out Bird, Julius Erving and everybody else\".[13]\n\n\nBaylor was the last of the great undersized forwards in a league where many guards are now his size or bigger.[28] He finished his playing days with 23,149 points, 3,650 assists and 11,463 rebounds over 846 games. His signature running bank shot, which he was able to release quickly and effectively over taller players, led him to numerous NBA scoring records, several of which still stand.[16]\n\n\nThe 71 points Baylor scored on November 15, 1960, was a record at the time; it was also a team record that would not be surpassed until Kobe Bryant scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in January 2006. The 61 points he scored in Game 5 of the NBA Finals in 1962 is still an NBA Finals record.[16] Over his career, he averaged 27.4 points and 4.3 assists per game. An underrated rebounder, Baylor averaged 13.5 rebounds per game during his career,[7][13] including a remarkable 19.8 rebounds per game during the 1960–61 season[29]—a season average exceeded by only five other players in NBA history, all of whom were 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) or taller.[30]\n\n\nA 10-time All-NBA First Team selection and 11-time NBA All-Star, Baylor was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1977.[7][13] He was named to the NBA 35th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1980, the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996 and the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. in 2009, *SLAM Magazine* ranked him number 11 among its Top 50 NBA players of all time. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Baylor as the 23rd greatest player in NBA history.[31] He is often listed as the greatest NBA player never to win a championship, although this is not technically true. Baylor was a member of the 1971-1972 Los Angeles Lakers team that won the NBA championship, and although he was not on the roster when they won the championship that year, he is still technically an NBA champion due to playing for the team at the beginning of the season. As such, Baylor was awarded a championship ring by the Lakers front office due to his leadership and contributions at the start of the season.[32][33][34]\n\n\nFifty-one years after Baylor left Seattle University, they named its basketball court in honor of him on November 19, 2009. The Redhawks now play on the Elgin Baylor Court in Seattle's KeyArena. The Redhawks also host the annual Elgin Baylor Classic. In June 2017, The College of Idaho had Baylor as one of the inaugural inductees into the school's Hall of Fame.[35]\n\n\nThe first biography of Baylor was written by *Slam* Online contributor Bijan C. Bayne in 2015, and published by Rowman and Littlefield.[36]\n\n\nOn April 6, 2018, a statue of Baylor, designed by Gary Tillery and Omri Amrany, was unveiled at the Staples Center prior to a Lakers game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.[37]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n\n\nElgin Baylor regular season statistics\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP\n | MPG\n | FG%\n | FT%\n | RPG\n | APG\n | PPG\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1958–59 | Minneapolis | 70\n | 40.8\n | .408\n | .777\n | 15.0\n | 4.1\n | 24.9\n |\n| 1959–60 | Minneapolis | 70\n | 41.0\n | .424\n | .732\n | 16.4\n | 3.5\n | 29.6\n |\n| 1960–61 | L.A.

He played 14 seasons as a forward in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers. Baylor was a gifted shooter, a strong rebounder, and an accomplished passer, who was best known for his trademark hanging jump shot. The No. 1 draft pick in 1958, NBA Rookie of the Year in 1959, 11-time NBA All-Star, and a 10-time member of the All-NBA first team, Baylor is regarded as one of the game's all-time greatest players.[1] In 1977, Baylor was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[2] In 1996, Baylor was named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.[3] In October 2021, Baylor was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team.[4]\n\n\nBaylor spent 22 years as general manager of the Los Angeles Clippers, having managed the team for the majority of the Donald Sterling ownership period. He won the NBA Executive of the Year Award in 2006. Two years later, the Clippers relieved him of his executive duties shortly before the 2008–09 season began.[5]\n\n\nHis popularity led to appearances on the television series *Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In* in 1968; the Jackson 5's first TV special in 1971; a *Buck Rogers in the 25th Century* episode \"Olympiad\"; and an episode of *The White Shadow* titled \"If Your Number's Up, Get Down\".\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nElgin \"Rabbit\" Baylor was born in Washington, D.C., on September 16, 1934,[6][7] the son of Uzziel (Lewis) and John Wesley Baylor.[8] He began playing basketball when he was 14.[9] Although he grew up near a D.C. city recreation center, African Americans were banned from using the facilities, and Baylor had limited access to basketball courts growing up.[10] He had two basketball-playing brothers, Sal and Kermit.[11] After stints at Southwest Boys Club and Brown Jr. High, Baylor was a three-time All-City player in high school.[12]\n\n\nBaylor played his first two years of high school basketball at Phelps Vocational High School in the 1951 and 1952 seasons. At the time, public schools in Washington, D.C., were segregated, so he only played against other black high school teams. There, Baylor set his first area scoring record of 44 points, versus Cardozo H.S.[12] During his two All-City years at Phelps, he averaged 18.5 and 27.6 points per season.[12] He did not perform well academically and dropped out of school (1952–53) to work in a furniture store and play basketball in the local recreational leagues.[12]\n\n\nBaylor reappeared for the 1954 season as a senior playing for the recently opened all-black Spingarn High School. The 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m),[7] 225 lb (102 kg)[13] senior was named first-team Washington All-Metropolitan, and was the first African-American player named to that team.[9] Baylor also won the SSA's Livingstone Trophy as the area's best basketball player for 1954. He finished with a 36.1 average for his eight Interhigh Division II league games.[12]\n\n\nOn February 3, 1954, in a game against his old Phelps team, Baylor scored 31 in the first half. Playing with four fouls the entire second half, Baylor scored 32 more points to establish a new DC-area record with 63 points. This broke the point record of 52 that Western's Jim Wexler had set the year before when he broke Baylor's previous record of 44. However, because Wexler was white and Baylor was black, Baylor's record did not receive the same press coverage from the media, including the *Washington Post*, as Wexler's.[12][10]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baylor at Seattle\nDespite his success as a high school basketball player, no major college recruited Baylor because at the time, college scouts did not recruit at black high schools.[6] While some colleges were willing to accept Baylor, he did not qualify academically.[9] A friend of Baylor's who attended the College of Idaho helped arrange a football scholarship for Baylor for the 1954-55 academic year.[6][9] Baylor never played football for the school, however; instead, he was accepted to the college's basketball team without having to try out.[6] He outperformed the other players on the team that season, averaging over 31 points and 20 rebounds per game.[6][9]\n\n\nAfter the season, the College of Idaho dismissed its head basketball coach and restricted the scholarships. A Seattle car dealer interested Baylor in Seattle University, and Baylor sat out a year to play for Westside Ford, an Amateur Athletic Union team in Seattle, while establishing eligibility at Seattle.[14] The Minneapolis Lakers drafted him in the 14th round of the 1956 NBA draft, but Baylor opted to stay in school instead.[15]\n\n\nDuring the 1956–57 season, Baylor averaged 29.7 points per game and 20.3 rebounds per game for Seattle.[9] The next season, Baylor averaged 32.5 points per game and led the Seattle University Chieftains (now known as the Redhawks) to the NCAA championship game, Seattle's only trip to the Final Four, falling to the Kentucky Wildcats.[6][9] Following his junior season, Baylor was drafted again by the Minneapolis Lakers, with the No. 1 pick in the 1958 NBA draft, and this time he opted to leave school to join them for the 1958–59 NBA season.[6][16]\n\n\nOver three collegiate seasons, one at College of Idaho and two at Seattle, Baylor averaged 31.3 points per game and 19.5 rebounds per game. He led the NCAA in rebounds during the 1956–57 season.[17]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Minneapolis / Los Angeles Lakers (1958–1971)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (1958–1959)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baylor standing next to teammates Jerry Chambers (center) and Jerry West (right), circa 1966\nThe Minneapolis Lakers used the No. 1 overall pick in the 1958 NBA draft to select Baylor, then convinced him to skip his senior year at SU and instead join the pro ranks. The team had been unsuccessful since the retirement of its star center George Mikan in 1954. The year prior to Baylor's arrival, the team finished 19–53 – the worst record in the league – with a squad that was slow, bulky and aging. It had no permanent home arena to play in, was losing popularity, and in financial trouble. Owner Bob Short, who was ready to sell the team, believed Baylor's star athletic talents and all-around game could save the franchise. Short told the *Los Angeles Times* in a 1971 interview: \"If he had turned me down then, I would have been out of business. The club would have gone bankrupt.\"[6][18] Baylor signed with the Lakers for $20,000 per year (equivalent to $210,000 in 2023), a large sum in the NBA at the time.[9] According to basketball historian James Fisher, by virtue of his exceptional skills and his central role in the team's business plan, Baylor became the NBA's first franchise player.[6]\n\n\nBaylor immediately exceeded expectations and ultimately saved the Lakers franchise.[6] As a rookie in 1958–59, Baylor finished fourth in the league in scoring (24.9 points per game), third in rebounding (15.0 rebounds per game), and eighth in assists (4.1 assists per game). He scored 55 points in a single game,[9] then the third-highest mark in league history behind Joe Fulks' 63 and Mikan's 61.[19]\n\n\nOn January 16, 1959, Baylor refused to play in a road game in Charleston, West Virginia, after the hotel the team booked denied lodging to the team's three black players.[20] When a teammate tried to convince Baylor to play in the game, Baylor said, \"I'm a human being, I'm not an animal put in a cage and let out for the show.\"[7]\n\n\nBaylor won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and led the Lakers to the NBA finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics in the first four-game sweep in finals history,[21] kicking off the greatest rivalry in NBA history.[7][13]\n\n\n\n#### Peak years (1959–1965)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The cover of the Los Angeles Lakers program for \"Elgin Baylor Night\" on March 21, 1969\nIn 1960, the Lakers moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles, drafted Jerry West to play point guard, and hired Fred Schaus who was also the coach during West’s college career. The duo of Baylor and West, joined in 1968 by center Wilt Chamberlain, led the Lakers to success in the Western Division throughout the 1960s.[7][13][20]\n\n\nFrom the 1960–61 to the 1962–63 seasons, Baylor averaged 34.8, 38.3, and 34.0 points per game, respectively. On November 15 of the 1960–61 season, Baylor set an NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks, while also grabbing 25 rebounds. In doing so, Baylor became the first NBA player to score more than 70 points in a game, breaking his own NBA record of 64 points that he had set the previous November. Baylor held the record until 1962, when Chamberlain scored 100 points.[6][7][13]\n\n\nBaylor, a United States Army Reservist, was called to active duty during the 1961–62 season, and being stationed at Fort Lewis in Washington, he could play for the Lakers only when on a weekend pass. He was unable to practice with the team before or during the season, and had to fly coach across the country on weekends to join the team at whichever arena they were appearing. Despite playing only 48 games that season, he still managed to score over 1,800 points, averaging 38.3 points (the highest average in NBA history by any player other than Chamberlain), 18.6 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game. Later that season, in a Game Five NBA Finals victory against the Boston Celtics, Baylor set the still-standing NBA record for points in an NBA Finals game with 61.[7] Basketball historian James Fisher described Baylor's performance that season as: \"Not bad for a part-time job.\"[6] Baylor later said he \"kind of enjoyed that season.\"[20]\n\n\n\n#### Knee injury and later seasons (1965–1971)[edit]\n\n\nBaylor suffered a severe knee injury during the opening game of the 1965 Western Division playoffs, which required surgery and left him unable to play in the remainder of the playoffs. Although he scored more than 24 points in each of the next four seasons despite his injury, the limitations of knee surgery at the time and the lack of meaningful rehab left him with nagging knee problems, ultimately resulting in surgery on both knees, which impaired his playing ability for the rest of his career.[7][13][20]\n\n\nBaylor played just two games in 1970–71 before rupturing his Achilles tendon,[9] and finally retired nine games into the subsequent 1971–72 season because of his nagging injuries.[13] Baylor told the press that he could no longer play at the highest level of the sport[7] and wanted to free up room on the Lakers' roster for other players.[6]\n\n\nIn 14 seasons as the Lakers' forward, Baylor helped lead the team to the NBA Finals eight times, but the team lost each time.[13] As a result of his retirement at the beginning of the season, Baylor missed two historic achievements: the Lakers' first game afterwards began an NBA record 33-game win streak, after which they won the 1972 championship.[20] The organization awarded Baylor a championship ring despite the early retirement.[7]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1974, Baylor was hired to be an assistant coach and later the head coach for the New Orleans Jazz, but had a lackluster 86–135 record and was fired following the 1978–79 season, shortly before the team moved to Salt Lake City, Utah.[7][13]\n\n\n\n## Executive career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1986, Baylor was hired by the Los Angeles Clippers as the team's vice president of basketball operations. He was selected as the NBA Executive of the Year in 2006.[22] During his tenure, the Clippers managed only two winning seasons and amassed a win–loss record of 607–1153.[23] They made the playoffs only four times,[13] and won only one playoff series.[23] He stayed in that capacity for 22 years until October 2008.[7]\n\n\n\n## Later life and death[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009 Baylor filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against the Clippers, team owner Donald Sterling, team president Andy Roeser, and the NBA. He alleged that he was underpaid during his tenure with the team and then fired because of his age and race.[24][25] Baylor later dropped the racial discrimination claims in the suit.[26] In 2011, a jury decided in the Clippers' favor on Baylor's remaining claims, finding Baylor's termination was based on the team's poor performance.[13][27] However, Baylor felt vindicated when Sterling was banned for life from the NBA in 2014 after recordings of him making racist comments were publicized by the press.[7][13]\n\n\nBaylor died in a Los Angeles hospital of natural causes on March 22, 2021, aged 86.[19] He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills. He was surrounded by his wife Elaine and their daughter Krystle; two children from a previous marriage, Alan and Alison; and a sister, Gladys.[7][13]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\nBaylor was known as an all-around player, excelling at defense, offense, rebounding, and passing. At 6'5\", 225lbs, he was short for a forward even for the time period in which he played, but he had the strength to \"muscle through\" defenders, and the finesse and creativity to maneuver around them, including to rebound missed shots and score second chance points. \n\n\nBaylor was known for his superior leaping abilities that allowed him to score by staying in the air longer than defenders; Bill Russell called him \"the godfather of hang time.\"[7] He invented \"moves\" to deceive defenders, involving changing hands or changing direction, even mid-air. \n\n\nBaylor's offensive repertoire included a running bank shot and a left-handed hook shot, though he was right-handed. He had an on-court facial twitch that he used as a head fake. Baylor credited his success to a talent for jumping and the creativity to spontaneously react to the defense.[6][13]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A letter from California Governor Ronald Reagan to Elgin Baylor\nSince the beginning of his NBA career, Baylor has been considered one of the best basketball players in the world, and his reputation as one of the greatest in history has endured. Before Baylor joined the NBA in 1958, the league's play was methodical but mechanical, dominated by set jump shots and running hook shots. Baylor introduced a creative and acrobatic playing style that would later be emulated by other NBA superstars such as Julius Erving and Michael Jordan.[6][13] Bill Simmons wrote, \"Along with Russell, Elgin turned a horizontal game into a vertical one.\"[7] Baylor's skill was esteemed by his contemporaries: Oscar Robertson wrote Baylor \"was the first and original high flier\"; Bill Sharman said Baylor was \"the greatest cornerman who ever played pro basketball\"; Tom Heinsohn said, \"Baylor as forward beats out Bird, Julius Erving and everybody else\".[13]\n\n\nBaylor was the last of the great undersized forwards in a league where many guards are now his size or bigger.[28] He finished his playing days with 23,149 points, 3,650 assists and 11,463 rebounds over 846 games. His signature running bank shot, which he was able to release quickly and effectively over taller players, led him to numerous NBA scoring records, several of which still stand.[16]\n\n\nThe 71 points Baylor scored on November 15, 1960, was a record at the time; it was also a team record that would not be surpassed until Kobe Bryant scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in January 2006. The 61 points he scored in Game 5 of the NBA Finals in 1962 is still an NBA Finals record.[16] Over his career, he averaged 27.4 points and 4.3 assists per game. An underrated rebounder, Baylor averaged 13.5 rebounds per game during his career,[7][13] including a remarkable 19.8 rebounds per game during the 1960–61 season[29]—a season average exceeded by only five other players in NBA history, all of whom were 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) or taller.[30]\n\n\nA 10-time All-NBA First Team selection and 11-time NBA All-Star, Baylor was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1977.[7][13] He was named to the NBA 35th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1980, the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996 and the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. in 2009, *SLAM Magazine* ranked him number 11 among its Top 50 NBA players of all time. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Baylor as the 23rd greatest player in NBA history.[31] He is often listed as the greatest NBA player never to win a championship, although this is not technically true. Baylor was a member of the 1971-1972 Los Angeles Lakers team that won the NBA championship, and although he was not on the roster when they won the championship that year, he is still technically an NBA champion due to playing for the team at the beginning of the season. As such, Baylor was awarded a championship ring by the Lakers front office due to his leadership and contributions at the start of the season.[32][33][34]\n\n\nFifty-one years after Baylor left Seattle University, they named its basketball court in honor of him on November 19, 2009. The Redhawks now play on the Elgin Baylor Court in Seattle's KeyArena. The Redhawks also host the annual Elgin Baylor Classic. In June 2017, The College of Idaho had Baylor as one of the inaugural inductees into the school's Hall of Fame.[35]\n\n\nThe first biography of Baylor was written by *Slam* Online contributor Bijan C. Bayne in 2015, and published by Rowman and Littlefield.[36]\n\n\nOn April 6, 2018, a statue of Baylor, designed by Gary Tillery and Omri Amrany, was unveiled at the Staples Center prior to a Lakers game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.[37]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n\n\nElgin Baylor regular season statistics\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP\n | MPG\n | FG%\n | FT%\n | RPG\n | APG\n | PPG\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1958–59 | Minneapolis | 70\n | 40.8\n | .408\n | .777\n | 15.0\n | 4.1\n | 24.9\n |\n| 1959–60 | Minneapolis | 70\n | 41.0\n | .424\n | .732\n | 16.4\n | 3.5\n | 29.6\n |\n| 1960–61 | L.A.
