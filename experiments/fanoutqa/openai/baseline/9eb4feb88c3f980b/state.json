It features the singles \"No, No, No\" and \"With Me\", both of which preceded the album. \"Killing Time\" was also featured in \"Men in Black: The Album\" and released as a promotional single in 1997. Prior to release, the album was set to be called \"Bridges\".[5]\nThe album spent twenty six weeks on the US *Billboard* 200 chart and peaked at number sixty-seven. To date the album has sold a total of 831,000 copies in America. In the United Kingdom, it reached the top fifty, peaking at number forty-five. It was re-packaged and re-released in several countries after the success of the follow-up album, *The Writing's on the Wall* (1999). The album was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics, including AllMusic and *Rolling Stone,* and won a Soul Train Lady of Soul Award for Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year.\n\n\n\n\n## Singles[edit]\n\n\n\"Killing Time\" was the first release of the album, it was featured on the Men In Black film and its accompanying soundtrack, from which it was released as a promotional single for, in 1997. \n\n\nThe first official single of the album was \"No, No, No\" in October 1997, where both Part 1 and Part 2 were released on the radio. It hit the top ten in 5 countries, and it hit #1 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Music videos were made for both versions of the song, both directed by Darren Grant.\n\n\n\"With Me\" followed as the second single in 1998 as a moderate success, hitting the top 20 in Netherlands and the United Kingdom. A radio-only single in the US, it was not eligible to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, but it hit the top 40 in some component charts. A music video for Part I was created, also directed by Darren Grant.\n\n\nAs the last release of the album, \"Illusion\" was released as a promotional single. Remixes by Maurice Joshua were commissioned for this release, where the group re-recorded their vocals exclusively for these remixes.\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nProfessional ratings| Review scores |\n| --- |\n| Source | Rating |\n| AllMusic | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[6] |\n| *The Encyclopedia of Popular Music* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[7] |\n| *Music Week* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[8] |\n| *Rolling Stone* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[9] |\n\n\n*Rolling Stone* gave the album a mixed review.[9] John Bush of the website AllMusic feels that \"Destiny's Child isn't quite just another debut album from an R&B girl group... Their voices sound beautiful together. Still, much of the album sounds indistinguishable from all the other female groups out there.[6]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\n*Destiny's Child* was a moderate chart success. It debuted at number sixty-nine on the US *Billboard* 200 during the week of March 7, 1998.[10] The album reached it peak at number sixty-seven in its fifth week and spent a total of 26 weeks on the chart.[11] On the *Billboard* Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart the album peaked at number fourteen.[12] In July 1998, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) , and later earned a platinum certification on July 11, 2000, for 1 million shipped units.[13] \nInternationally the album album achieved greater success; it reached number twenty-nine on the Canadian Albums Chart, number thirty on the Dutch MegaCharts albums chart and number forty-five on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\n\n## Track listing[edit]\n\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes[14]\n\n\n\n***Destiny's Child*** \u2013 Standard edition| No. | Title | Writer(s) | Producer(s) | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | \"Second Nature\" | * Marvin Isley\n* Ronald Isley\n* Rudolph Isley\n* Ernie Isley\n* O'Kelly Isley\n* Chris Jasper\n* Terry T\n* Kymberli Armstrong\n | * Dwayne Wiggins\n* Terry T[a]\n* Jay Lincoln[a]\n | 5:09 |\n| 2. | \"No, No, No Part 2\" (featuring Wyclef Jean) | * Mary Brown\n* Rob Fusari\n* Vincent Herbert\n* Calvin Gaines\n* Barry White\n | * Wyclef\n* Jerry Duplessis[a]\n* Che Greene[a]\n | 3:27 |\n| 3. | \"With Me Part I\" (featuring Jermaine Dupri) | * Master P\n* Jermaine Dupri\n* Manuel Seal\n | * Dupri\n* Seal[a]\n | 3:26 |\n| 4. | \"Tell Me\" | * Bob Robinson\n* Tim Kelley\n | * Robinson\n* Kelley\n | 4:48 |\n| 5. | \"Bridges\" | * Michelle Hailey\n* Wiggins\n* Al Green\n | Wiggins | 4:02 |\n| 6. | \"No, No, No Part 1\" | * Brown\n* Herbert\n* Fusari\n* Gaines\n | * Herbert\n* Fusari\n | 4:07 |\n| 7. | \"With Me Part II\" (featuring Master P) | * Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles\n* Kelly Rowland\n* LaTavia Roberson\n* LeToya Luckett\n* Dupri\n* Master P\n* Seal\n | * Craig Bazile\n* KLC\n* Odell\n | 4:14 |\n| 8. | \"Show Me the Way\" | * Darcy Aldridge\n* Carl Breeding\n* Jeffrey Bowden\n | Carl Washington | 4:19 |\n| 9. | \"Killing Time\" | * Wiggins\n* Taura Stinson\n | Wiggins | 5:09 |\n| 10. | \"Illusion\" (featuring Wyclef Jean & Pras) | * Isaac Hayes\n* Tony Swain\n* Steve Jolley\n* Ashley Ingram\n* Leslie John\n | * Jean\n* Pras[a]\n* Duplessis[a]\n | 3:52 |\n| 11. | \"Birthday\" | * Knowles\n* Rowland\n* Roberson\n* Wiggins\n | Wiggins | 5:15 |\n| 12. | \"Sail On\" | Lionel Richie | * Mark Morales\n* Cory Rooney\n | 4:04 |\n| 13. | \"My Time Has Come\" (dedicated to Andretta Tillman) | * Reed Vertelney\n* Sylvia Bennett-Smith\n | Bennett-Smith | 4:25 |\n| Total length: | 56:09 |\n\n***Destiny's Child*** \u2013 International edition| No. | Title | Writer(s) | Producer(s) | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 14. | \"Know That\" | * Rachel Oden\n* Andre Robinson\n | Father Shaheed | 4:24 |\n| Total length: | 60:33 |\n\n***Destiny's Child*** \u2013 Japanese edition| No. | Title | Writer(s) | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 15. | \"Amazing Grace\" | John Newton | 2:39 |\n| Total length: | 65:15 |\n\n***Destiny's Child*** \u2013 2001 European reissue edition| No. | Title | Writer(s) | Producer(s) | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 15. | \"You're the Only One\" | * Wiggins\n* Stinson\n | * Mark Wilson\n* Herbert\n* Gaines\n* Fusari[a]\n | 3:23 |\n| 16. | \"No, No, No\" (Camdino Soul extended remix) | * Brown\n* Herbert\n* Fusari\n* Gaines\n | * Wyclef\n* Katt[b]\n* Jazzie[b]\n | 6:34 |\n| 17. | \"DubiLLusions\" (dub mix of \"Illusions\") | * Hayes\n* Swain\n* Jolley\n* Ingram\n* John\n | Maurice Joshua | 7:33 |\n| Total length: | 78:03 |\n\n***Destiny's Child*** \u2013 US enhanced edition (bonus video)| No. | Title | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | \"Video Interviews with the Group and Each Member\" |  |\n\n**Notes**\n\n\n\n* **^a**  signifies a co-producer\n* **^b**  signifies an additional producer\n* Some copies of the album credit no writers for \"Illusion\".[14]\n* A pre-release promotional version of the album was issued in 1997, when it was still called \"Bridges\", with a different tracklist.

It was released on July 14, 1999, by Columbia Records. Seeking transition from the neo soul sound of their eponymous studio album (1998), Destiny's Child enlisted an almost entirely different array, including Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs, Kandi Burruss, Missy Elliott, Rodney Jerkins, and LaShawn Daniels, among others. Lyrically, the album is constructed as a concept album, with each track representing a Ten Commandments-inspired \"Commandment of Relationships\". Its themes include infatuation, dependency, infidelity, and separation, while a loose religious theme is maintained throughout the album.\n\n\nMusically, *The Writing's on the Wall* is an R&B, pop, hip hop, and soul record incorporating unconventional sonic elements, complex arrangements and layered staccato rap-singing vocals. The production and innovative approach earned critical acclaim, which would further solidify in retrospective reviews. A commercial success, the album debuted at number six on the US *Billboard* 200, with first-week sales of 133,000 units. Due to vigorous promotional activities and success of its singles, its sales continuously burgeoned. Consequently, *The Writing's on the Wall* peaked at number five and went on to be certified octuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). With worldwide sales of 13 million copies, the album is one of the best-selling girl group albums and best-selling R&B albums of all time.\n\n\n*The Writing's on the Wall* produced four singles. \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" became Destiny's Child's first US *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one single and attained the top ten in several other countries; it was also nominated for two Grammy Awards. \"Bug a Boo\" failed to replicate the success of its predecessor, peaking only at number 33 on the *Billboard* Hot 100 and faring moderately overseas. \"Say My Name\" became the group's second *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one single and a widespread international success. Critically acclaimed, it won them their first two Grammy Awards, with its accompanying music video winning their first MTV Video Music Award. \"Jumpin', Jumpin'\" became Destiny Child's first US Mainstream Top 40 number-one single, while peaking at number three on the *Billboard* Hot 100.\n\n\nConsidered Destiny's Child's breakthrough album by music critics, *The Writing's on the Wall* was immensely overshadowed by the controversy surrounding its promotional cycle as a result of the group's internal conflicts. The music video for \"Say My Name\" saw original members LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson\u2013who had attempted to split with their manager Mathew Knowles\u2013unexpectedly replaced with Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams. Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit against Knowles and former bandmates, and Franklin departed from Destiny's Child a mere five months after joining, leaving it as a trio. Regardless of the turmoil, various publications have listed the album among the best records of its time and genre, noting the immense influence on numerous artists decades after its release.\n\n\n\n\n## Background and development[edit]\n\n\nIn 1995, Destiny was signed to Elektra Records by Sylvia Rhone. However, they were dismissed from the label eight months into their contract, without having even released an album, for being \"too young and undeveloped\".[3] Changing their name to Destiny's Child, the group was signed to Columbia Records by Teresa LaBarbera Whites in 1996, after negotiations from Beyonc\u00e9's father Mathew Knowles, who became the group's manager.[4] Destiny's Child made their recording debut with the inclusion of the track \"Killing Time\" on the *Men in Black* soundtrack in July 1997.[5] Three months later, their debut single \"No, No, No\" was released, eventually going on to peak at number three on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 and atop the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.[6][7] The neo soul and R&B-infused eponymous debut studio album followed in February 1998, to a mixed critical reception.[8]\n\n\nCommercially, *Destiny's Child* was a slow seller, peaking only at number 67 on the US *Billboard* 200,[9] but managed to earn a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) two years after its release.[10] It produced one more single, \"With Me\", which failed to replicate the success of its predecessor. Beyonc\u00e9 would retrospectively label their debut album \"successful but not hugely successful\" as it was \"a neo-soul record and we were 15 years old. It was way too mature for us.\"[11] In September, the group's contribution to the *Why Do Fools Fall in Love* soundtrack, \"Get on the Bus\"\u2013a collaboration with Timbaland\u2013was released to moderate commercial success. Around this time, Destiny's Child\u2013partly dissatisfied with their debut\u2013began conceiving ideas for its follow-up. As they were preparing to write and record new material, they sat together and listed what they liked and disliked about the debut in order to improve.[12]\n\n\n\n## Recording and production[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"With *The Writing's on the Wall*, we did the whole album in about three weeks. Sometimes we did two songs a day. Some songs might take two days but we're very, very quick in the studio.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2013Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles reflecting on the fast-paced recording process for *The Writing's on the Wall*.[13]\n\nThe production for *The Writing's on the Wall* commenced in October 1998.[13] Beyonc\u00e9 later claimed the group wasn't nervous about a sophomore slump and had many ideas for the album, as they weren't entirely satisfied with their debut.[14] Compared to its predecessor, the album saw group members take more creative control; Beyonc\u00e9 co-wrote 11 out of 16 tracks, Kelly Rowland co-wrote ten, LeToya Luckett nine and LaTavia Roberson eight.[15][16] They would rewrite lyrics they received to adjust them into songs suitable for them.[17] Beyonc\u00e9 sought inspiration for her songwriting from the customers at her mother Tina Knowles' hair salon, namely their grievances and complaints over men, relationships and financial hardships.[13] She additionally produced four tracks from the album, while participating in vocal production and arrangement on several tracks as well.[16]\n\n\nThe group's artists and repertoire (A&R) executive Teresa LaBarbera Whites suggested the group to consult producer Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs.[13] Upon arriving to Houston, where majority of *The Writing's on the Wall* was recorded, Briggs and his then-girlfriend, singer-songwriter Kandi Burruss, were told there was space for only one more track on the album. However, after the pair presented \"Bug a Boo\", the group decided to structure the entire record around it. Briggs ended up producing four additional songs\u2013\"So Good\", \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", \"Hey Ladies\" and \"She Can't Love You\"\u2013co-writing them with Burruss.[17] Burruss would reveal in 2011 that at the time of the album's production, one of the group members was dating her former boyfriend on whom \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" was based.[18] Being promoted to executive producer alongside the group's manager Mathew Knowles, Briggs introduced skittering quadruple-time beats while encouraging stuttering vocal phrasing, both of which defined the album's sound.[13]\n\n\nRodney Jerkins produced \"Say My Name\", which was recorded at the Pacifique Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles. He co-wrote it with his brother Fred Jerkins III, LaShawn Daniels and the group members.[16] Daniels, who helmed its vocal production, based the song on a relationship he had experienced. He said it was \"actually the premise of what I would go through, and we had the conversation of 'how embarrassing is that?'\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9 was in a relationship at that time, and she could relate well to the situation.\"[19] However, the group rejected the song's original mix, and the track was almost left unused. Beyonc\u00e9 later described the original mix as having \"too much stuff going on in it. It just sounded like this ... jungle.\"[11] Jerkins then introduced a new mix of the song to Mathew Knowles, and the track was subsequently included on the album.[11] According to Daniels, Destiny's Child equally contributed to the track, stating: \"As time went forward, their creative input was undeniable. If you came up with a melody or something, and it just didn't sit well with them, or if they didn't think it was dope, their creativity would absolutely speak back. We always had a respect of each other's creativity. There were no egos to stop any idea from making it out of any of our mouths.\"[19]\n\n\nMissy Elliott wrote and produced \"Confessions\", on which she made a guest appearance; the track was recorded at The Hit Factory in New York City and The Enterprise in Los Angeles.[16] D'wayne Wiggins produced and co-wrote \"Temptations\" and \"Sweet Sixteen\", which were recorded at the Digital Sound in Houston and the House of Music in Oakland, California.[16] \"Stay\" was solely written and produced by Daryl Simmons, being recorded at the Silent Sound Studios in Atlanta.[16] Next were featured on \"If You Leave\", which was written by their member R.L. Huggar; it was co-written and produced by Chad Elliot, who also co-wrote and produced \"Jumpin, Jumpin\". The former was recorded at the Electric Lady Studios in New York City and the Dallas Sound Lab, while the latter was recorded at the 353 Studio in New York City and the 24/7 Studio in Atlanta.[16] Meanwhile, Ken Fambro and Donnie Boynton co-wrote and produced \"Now That She's Gone\". By April 1999, *The Writing's on the Wall* had been completed.[13]\n\n\n\n## Music and lyrics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Missy Elliott (pictured) is featured on the 1970s-influenced mid-tempo \"Confessions\", which she wrote and produced.\n*The Writing's on the Wall* is predominantly an R&B, pop, hip hop and soul record.[15][20][21] Its instrumentations notably incorporate sounds such as record scratches, bubbles and breaking glass, as well as guitar riffs \"chiseled to a point like stiletto heels\", complex percussion arrangements, and orchestral brass \"draped in the background like plush curtains\", while the vocals are \"wound in and around like scrollwork\".[15] Constructed as a concept album, each of its tracks represents a Ten Commandments-inspired \"Commandment of Relationships\", which is stated at the end of each track in reference to the following one.[22] Lyrically, the album has been described as having a \"cynical, jaded, sometimes transactional view of love\".[17] It opens with its title-track intro inspired by *The Godfather* scene in the 1996 film *Set It Off*, which sees Rowland, Luckett and Roberson gathering to meet their \"godfather\" Beyonc\u00e9 and to discuss their \"Commandments of Relationships\". As the members mention betrayal from different men, the tone for the album is immediately set as \"a tale of empowerment and vengeance\".[23] The first commandment \"Thou shalt not hate\" announces \"So Good\", which sees the protagonist flaunting her success to a hateful and jealous former lover.[13] Its instrumentation consists of sped-up acoustic guitar loops.[13] The \"sassy\", \"playful\" and \"jittery\" R&B track \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" features \"slinky\" instrumentation led by harpsichord-synthesizers.[24][25] Lyrically, the song confronts a boyfriend for his lack of accountability over credit card and phone bill charges while following the \"Thou shalt pay bills\" commandment. Numerous critics drew parallels between the track and TLC's \"No Scrubs\", also written by Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs and Kandi Burruss around the same time.[26][13] Burruss claimed it was written based on her own personal experience with a former boyfriend.[13] On the 1970s-influenced soul track \"Confessions\", featuring a spoken-word performance by Missy Elliott, Beyonc\u00e9 admits to infidelity as \"Thou shalt confess\".[23][13] \"Bug a Boo\" speaks against an overly-attached boyfriend and follows the \"Thou shalt not bug\" commandment.[23] The \"coy, pillowy\" sixth track \"Temptation\" discusses abstinence from having sex with a virtual stranger while already being involved in a relationship, as \"Thou shalt not give in to temptation\".[15][23]\n\n\n\"Now That She's Gone\" showcases a female protagonist's refusal to rekindle the relationship with a former boyfriend who has returned after being abandoned by another woman, due to the \"Thou shalt not think you got it like that\" commandment.[23] \"Thou shalt not leave me wondering\" is the theme of \"Where'd You Go\", which sees a protagonist pleading her partner to stay after noticing his loss of interest towards her.[23] The upbeat \"Hey Ladies\" encourages women to take a stand against their deceitful boyfriends as \"Thou shalt know when he's got to go\".[23][13] The \"late night, slow-jam\" tenth track \"If You Leave\" is a collaboration with Next, who are referenced in its commandment \"Thou shalt move on to the next\". Lyrically, the song centers around a couple debating over whether they should leave their respective partners and begin a relationship together.[13] The uptempo dance-pop track \"Jumpin, Jumpin\" encourages women to \"leave [their] men at home\" in favor of going to a nightclub filled with rich men, under the commandment \"Thou shalt get your party on\".[27] The commandment \"Thou shalt say my name\" precedes \"Say My Name\", singled out by multiple publications as the album's highlight.[23][13] The track reprises the \"thick, paranoid mix\" of Rodney Jerkins' prior production \"The Boy Is Mine\", the 1998 duet between Brandy and Monica.[15] It \"hopscotches\" through different sonic elements, shifting from a \"slow, sexy\" bass to syncopated, synth-infused strings and record scratches.[19] Lyrically, the song features a female protagonist suspecting her boyfriend of cheating.[13] Acoustic guitar-driven Latin and bolero ballad \"She Can't Love You\" is lyrically characterized by the commandment \"Thou shalt know she can't love you\", as Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"She can't love you like I can / All of her love just can't compare to what I have\".[23][28] The ballad \"Stay\" is preceded by \"If thou can wait, then thou shalt stay\", and discusses a relationship which is deteriorating due to the female protagonist not wanting to consummate it, much to her boyfriend's dissatisfaction.[23] \"Thou shalt cherish life\" is the message of \"Sweet Sixteen\", which follows a girl named Jackie who is eager to grow up.[23] *The Writing's on the Wall* closes with an *a cappella* cover of \"Amazing Grace\", which acts as the outro and is dedicated to the late Andretta Tilman, the group's original manager.[23]\n\n\n\n## Title and packaging[edit]\n\n\nSpeaking of the title for *The Writing's on the Wall* in a May 2000 interview for *Jet*, Kelly Rowland revealed: \"When we were looking for a title, we had that name and another. We asked Wyclef which was tighter. He said, '*The Writing's On The Wall* sounds really cool'. Then he went into a story about Moses finding the Ten Commandments on the wall. He said 'add that to Destiny's Child's commandments of relationships, which will mean something big is about to happen.\"[14] Similarly, biographer Daryl Easlea noted the title was taken from the Book of Daniel from the Bible's Old Testament; in the book, supernatural writing foretold the demise of Babylonia.[13]\n\n\nRelated to the title, all 14 \"Commandments of Relationships\" heard on *The Writing's on the Wall* are listed on the front of its CD.[16] The cover artwork for the album was photographed by Hide Olda and depicts the members wearing white halter tops and facing directly into the camera. The light grey wall behind them features the group's name and the album's title written in a blurry manner, signifying \"the writings on the wall\".[16] Jaelani Turner-Williams from *Stereogum* described the cover as \"futuristic\".[29]\n\n\n\n## Release and promotion[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, *The Writing's on the Wall* was released on July 27, 1999, by Columbia Records.[30] Initially, it wasn't heavily promoted; the first televised performance in support of the album was that of \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" at the Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards on September 3.[31] The group subsequently embarked on TLC's FanMail Tour as an opening act during its October\u2013December North American leg.[32] Promotion intensified following the release of \"Say My Name\" as the album's third single, with the group performing the song on *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno* on March 3, 2000,[33] at the 2000 Soul Train Music Awards on March 4,[34] with \"Bug a Boo\" during *MTV Spring Break* on March 16,[35][36] on the April 7 episode of *Top of the Pops* in the United Kingdom,[37] at the TMF Awards in the Netherlands on April 15,[38] and as an opening act for Britney Spears' free (You Drive Me) Crazy Tour concert in Honolulu, Hawaii on April 24.[39] They continued promoting the album by performing its fourth and final single \"Jumpin', Jumpin'\" on *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno* on June 8,[40] and on the July 28 episode of *Top of the Pops*.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Destiny's Child performing \"Say My Name\" during their Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It tour in 2005\nOn July 9, Destiny's Child performed \"So Good\", \"Say My Name\" and \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" during Party in the Park in London.[42] That month, they joined Christina Aguilera as opening acts on her tour Christina Aguilera in Concert, touring North America until October.[43] While on tour, the group performed a 45-minute set at The Big E on September 17,[44] as well as performing \"Say My Name\" at the MuchMusic Video Awards on September 21.[45] In Europe, *The Writing's on the Wall* was re-released to include a bonus disc with then-new single \"Independent Women Part I\" in November.[46] At the *Billboard* Music Awards on December 5, the group performed a medley composed of \"Independent Women Part I\", \"Say My Name\" and \"Jumpin', Jumpin'\".[47] They performed nominated songs \"Independent Women Part I\" and \"Say My Name\" at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards on February 21, 2001, when they won their first two Grammy Awards, both for \"Say My Name\".[48] In honor of the album's 20th anniversary in July 2019, Sony Music launched \"Destiny's Child 2019 Dating Commandments\". Similar to Tinder, the interactive dating app modernized the 14 \"Commandments of Relationships\" from the album.[49] In addition, the album was made available on a limited-edition clear vinyl with black splatter exclusively at Urban Outfitters on November 1.[50]\n\n\n\n## Singles[edit]\n\n\n\"Bills, Bills, Bills\" was released as the lead single from *The Writing's on the Wall* on May 31, 1999.[51] A commercial success, it became Destiny's Child's first US *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one single,[6] also topping the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for nine consecutive weeks.[7] The digital single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on July 2, 2020.[10] Internationally, the song reached the top ten in Belgium, Canada, Iceland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.[52][53][54][55] Critically acclaimed, it was nominated for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best R&B Song at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards (2000).[56] Its accompanying music video was directed by Darren Grant and was a tribute to Tina Knowles, Beyonc\u00e9's mother and the group's then-stylist, as it depicts group members as hair salon employees frustrated with men.[57]\n\n\n\"Bug a Boo\" was released as the second single from *The Writing's on the Wall* on July 7, 1999.[58] It failed to replicate the commercial success of its predecessor, as it peaked only at number 33 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 and number 15 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.[6][7] The song fared better internationally, peaking within the top ten in the Netherlands and the UK.[59][55] Its Grant-directed accompanying music video shows the group members fleeing from aggravating boyfriends, and features cameo appearances from Kobe Bryant and Wyclef Jean.[57]\n\n\n\"Say My Name\" was released as the third single from *The Writing's on the Wall* on October 14, 1999. It became Destiny's Child's second US *Billboard* Hot 100 and third US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs number-one single.[6][7] The digital single was certified triple platinum by the RIAA on July 2, 2020.[10] Internationally, the song reached the summit in Australia and the top ten in Belgium, Canada, France, Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland and the UK.[60][53][61][62][55] Critically acclaimed, it won the group's first two Grammy Awards\u2013for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best R&B Song\u2013while also being nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year, at the 43rd annual ceremony (2001).[63] Its Joseph Kahn-directed accompanying music video was a subject of controversy, as it saw LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson be replaced\u2013without their knowledge or consent\u2013with Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams.[27] The video won the group their first MTV Video Music Award, for Best R&B Video in 2000.[64]\n\n\n\"Jumpin', Jumpin'\" was released as the fourth and final single from *The Writing's on the Wall* on July 4, 2000, to critical acclaim.[10] A commercial success, it peaked at number three on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 and became the group's first US Mainstream Top 40 number-one single.[6][65] The digital single was certified platinum by the RIAA on July 2, 2020.[10] Internationally, the song attained the top ten in Australia, Canada, Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the UK.[66][53][67][55] Its accompanying music video was the group's second consecutive to be directed by Kahn, and shows the members going out to a nightclub.[57]\n\n\n\"So Good\" was serviced to rhythmic contemporary radio in the United States on January 16, 2001.[68] However, its single treatment was halted due to the success of \"Independent Women Part I\" and Destiny's Child heading forward into the promotional cycle for their subsequent studio album *Survivor*.[69]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nProfessional ratings| Review scores |\n| --- |\n| Source | Rating |\n| AllMusic | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[70] |\n| *The Encyclopedia of Popular Music* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[71] |\n| *Entertainment Weekly* | B[72] |\n| *The Guardian* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[73] |\n| *NME* | 6/10[22] |\n| *Pitchfork* | 9.0/10[15] |\n| *Q* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[74] |\n| *Rolling Stone* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[26] |\n| *The Rolling Stone Album Guide* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[75] |\n| *The Village Voice* | B+[76] |\n\n\nUpon its release, *The Writing's on the Wall* received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic wrote that with the album \"Destiny's Child still suffers from slightly uneven songwriting, but it's nevertheless an assured step forward for the girl group\", adding that \"even when the album fails to deliver memorable songs, it always sounds alluring, thanks to the perfect combination of vocalists and producers\".[70] Rob Brunner from *Entertainment Weekly* praised the group for being able to \"prove themselves to be more capable of confident, inventive R&B than many of their contemporaries\" with the album but dismissed the \"banal balladry\" of \"Stay\" and \"Sweet Sixteen\".[72] Writing for *The Village Voice*, Robert Christgau commended the group for sounding mature but criticized the album's lyrical content.[76] Rob Sheffield from *Rolling Stone* was, however, more negative towards the album, writing: \"Despite OK moments like the \"Waterfalls\" sequel \"Sweet Sixteen,\" the Destiny children never find that one money tune that turns a no-no-no scrub into a yeah-yeah-yeah paying customer.[26] In a review for *NME*, Dele Fadele praised the contemporary sound of the album, citing \"Confessions\" and \"If You Leave\" as its highlights.[22]\n\n\nRetrospectively, *The Writing's on the Wall* has continued receiving critical acclaim. In *The New Rolling Stone Album Guide* (2004), Nathan Brackett and Christian Hoard referenced Sheffield's 1999 review for *Rolling Stone* by saying the album's singles \"Say My Name\" and \"Jumpin', Jumpin'\" were, indeed, \"catchy enough to turn any no-no-no scrub into yeah-yeah-yeah paying customer\".[75] In *The Encyclopedia of Popular Music* (2007), Colin Larkin gave the album a four-star review.[71] Katherine St. Asaph from *Pitchfork* praised the album for its impact and influence on R&B artists, writing: \"Beyond its tabloid drama, the innovation of Destiny's Child's second album codified the sound of R&B at the turn of the millennium.\"[15] Wren Graves from *Consequence* praised the album for having \"remarkably good\" non-single tracks, but dismissed \"Temptation\" and \"If You Leave\" as its \"dull spots\".[77] Taryn Finley of *HuffPost* praised the album for helping \"usher in a new wave of R&B\", labeling it \"the quintessential 1999 album\".[78]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nFor the complete list of awards won by Destiny's Child and the singles from *The Writing's on the Wall*, see List of awards and nominations received by Destiny's Child.\n\n### Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nAwards and nominations for *The Writing's on the Wall*\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category | Nominee(s)\n | Result | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000 | Soul Train Music Award | Best R&B/Soul Album \u2013 Group, Band or Duo | *The Writing's on the Wall* | Nominated\n | [79]\n |\n| 2000\n | Soul Train Lady of Soul Award | Best R&B/Soul Album\n | Won\n | [80]\n |\n| 2001 | American Music Award | Favorite Soul/R&B Album | Nominated\n | [81]\n |\n\n\n### Listings[edit]\n\n\n\n\nListings for *The Writing's on the Wall*\n| Year\n | Publication\n | List\n | Position\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1999\n | *The Face* | Recordings of the Year\n | 9\n | [82]\n |\n| 2002\n | *Q* | 100 Women Who Rock the World\n | 77\n | [83]\n |\n| 2007\n | Rock and Roll Hall of Fame | Definitive 200\n | 160\n | [84]\n |\n| *Vibe* | The 150 Albums That Define the *Vibe* Era\n | \u2013\n | [85]\n |\n| 2008\n | *Entertainment Weekly* | The New Classics: Music\n | 92\n | [86]\n |\n| 2013\n | *NME* | The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\n | 454\n | [87]\n |\n| 2017\n | *Complex* | The 50 Best R&B Albums of the '90s\n | 31\n | [20]\n |\n| NPR | The 150 Greatest Albums Made By Women\n | 61\n | [88]\n |\n| 2019\n | Okayplayer | The 19 Most Influential R&B Albums of '90s\n | \u2013\n | [89]\n |\n| 2020\n | *PopMatters* | The Most Memorable Albums of 1999\n | \u2013\n | [90]\n |\n| *Rolling Stone* | The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time | 291\n | [91]\n |\n| 2022\n | *Pitchfork* | The 150 Best Albums of the 1990s\n | 45\n | [92]\n |\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, *The Writing's on the Wall* debuted at number six on the *Billboard* 200 chart dated August 14, 1999, with first-week sales of 133,000 copies.[93] On the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, it debuted and peaked at number two the same week.[94] The album was the 42nd best-selling album of 1999, selling 1.6 million copies by the end of the year.[95] The heavy rotation of its third single \"Say My Name\" and increased promotional activities reinvigorated the album's sales. Seven weeks after \"Say My Name\" reached the summit of the *Billboard* Hot 100, the album registered a new single-week sales high with 157,000 units.[93] It subsequently went on to ascend towards a new peak on the *Billboard* 200 at number five on May 6, 2000.[96] During the Christmas week of 2000, the album achieved its highest single-week sales with 163,000 units, while remaining stable within the top 40 in its 74th week of charting.[97][98] On the year-end *Billboard* 200 for 2000, it placed at number 13, and was the tenth best-selling album of the year with sales of 3.8 million copies.[99][100] In total, it spent 99 consecutive weeks on the *Billboard* 200, exiting from the chart in July 2001.[49] On November 6, the album was certified octuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[101] As of 2015, the album has sold over seven million units in the country, being the second best-selling girl group album ever in the US.[o]\n\n\nInternationally, *The Writing's on the Wall* was a sleeper hit. In Canada, it debuted at number 13 on the Canadian Albums Chart dated August 14, 1999,[102] peaking at number five after a year of charting on August 26, 2000.[103] It was certified quintuple platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) on February 28, 2001.[104] In Australia, it debuted at number nine on the ARIA Top 100 Albums and peaked at number two in its third week.[105] The album was certified triple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) in February 2001.[106] In New Zealand, the album debuted at number 30 before departing from the chart in its second week. It re-entered the chart in its third week and went on to peak at number six in its tenth week.[107] Recording Industry Association of New Zealand certified it triple platinum in November 2000.[108] In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 12 on the UK Albums Chart and atop the UK R&B Albums Chart.[109][110] It was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in August 2000 and,[111] after 70 weeks of fluctuations, peaked at number ten on the UK Albums Chart on January 6, 2001.[112] In Europe, the album peaked at number 23 on the European Top 100 Albums after being reissued,[113] and was certified double platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).[114] In addition, it eventually ascended to the top ten in Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Portugal after debuting at lower positions.[105][115] With worldwide sales of 13 million copies, *The Writing's on the Wall* is the fourth best-selling girl group album of all time, also being one of the best-selling R&B albums of all time.[116][15][117]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michelle Williams (pictured) and Farrah Franklin joined Destiny's Child as replacements for LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson, amid *The Writing's on the Wall*'s promotional cycle.\nThe promotional era of *The Writing's on the Wall* was infused with controversy and conflicts within Destiny's Child's members and management. In December 1999, LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson attempted to split with their manager Mathew Knowles, claiming that he kept a disproportionate share of the group's profits and unfairly favored his daughter Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and Kelly Rowland.[118] While they never intended to leave the group, they found out that two new members were joining Beyonc\u00e9 and Rowland once the accompanying music video for \"Say My Name\" premiered on February 15, 2000.[118] Prior to its premiere, Beyonc\u00e9 announced on *Total Request Live* that Luckett and Roberson had left the group.[4] They were replaced by Michelle Williams, a former backup singer to Monica, and Farrah Franklin, an aspiring singer-actress.[119] Shortly after her stint with Monica, Williams was introduced to Destiny's Child by choreographer Braden \"Peanut Orlando\" Larson, and was flown to Houston, where she stayed with the Knowles family.[119]\n\n\nOn March 15, Roberson and Luckett filed a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles and their former bandmates for breach of partnership and fiduciary duties.[13] Following the lawsuit, both sides were disparaging towards each other in the media.[118] Five months after joining, Franklin left Destiny's Child. The remaining members claimed that this was due to missed promotional appearances and concerts. According to Williams, Franklin could not handle stress.[119] Franklin, however, disclosed that she left because of the negativity surrounding the strife and her inability to assert any control in the decision-making.[118] Her departure was seen as less controversial. Williams, on the other hand, disclosed that her inclusion in the group resulted in her \"battling insecurity\" by saying: \"I was comparing myself to the other members, and the pressure was on me.\"[119] Towards the end of 2000, Roberson and Luckett dropped the portion of their lawsuit aimed at Beyonc\u00e9 and Rowland in exchange for a settlement, though they continued the action against Mathew Knowles. As part of the agreement, both sides were prohibited from speaking about each other publicly.[118] Roberson and Luckett formed another girl group named Anjel but also left it due to issues with their record company 581 Entertainment.[120]\n\n\n\n## Impact and legacy[edit]\n\n\n*The Writing's on the Wall* has been declared Destiny's Child's breakthrough album by numerous music critics, as it spurred their career and introduced them to a wider audience.[119][11] Chris Malone from *Billboard* stated the album \"almost instantly cemented Destiny's Child\u00a0as one of the most iconic girl groups of all time\".[23] Despite initial skepticism towards the album, various critics would acknowledge its immense impact on R&B and pop music in retrospective commentary, crediting it for having defined the sound of mainstream music at the turn of the millennium.[78][15] Music industry writer Naima Cochrane called it one of the most important recordings of the transitional phase between the 1990s and 2000s, adding that it \"set the tone for what mainstream R&B was gonna sound like for the next several years and the R&B sound that was neo-soul started moving into the adult urban lane. *The Writing's on the Wall* is like that fork in the road between what started as mainstream R&B and what ended up becoming adult contemporary R&B.\"[78] Its feminist lyrical undertones have also received recognition.[121] Meena Alexander from *Stylist* remarked: \"Despite being only 17 when the album was released, Destiny's Child had already cultivated a feminist message that stood out amid the saccharine girl-pop and heartbroken ballads of their contemporaries.\"[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Writing's on the Wall* has been credited for allowing Beyonc\u00e9 (pictured) to launch her solo career. Several critics have also noted its lyrical influence on her sixth solo studio album *Lemonade* (2016).\nWithin the period of its commercial peak, *The Writing's on the Wall* was at the center of controversy, following the highly publicized departure of LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson, original members of Destiny's Child, in February 2000 and the ensuing lawsuit they filed against the group and their manager Mathew Knowles. Regardless, the album \"emerged unscathed, bursting with bangers and destined to become one of the best-selling R&B albums of all time\".[117] Although members were affected by the turmoil, the group's success continued, with the years following the controversy seen as the most substantial stretch of their career,[118] and them becoming a pop culture phenomenon.[4] Their third studio album *Survivor* (2001) and its title track are considered responses to the media for the scrutiny the group was placed under throughout the promotional era of *The Writing's on the Wall*.[122] Multiple critics have also noted the album for being the platform upon which Beyonc\u00e9 would launch her solo career.[117][15] Tom Breihan from *Stereogum* shared those sentiments, adding: \"Beyonc\u00e9, who dominated every track on *The Writing's On The Wall*, was young enough to take immediately to the new sounds that were suddenly reshaping R&B aesthetics. And she'd practiced hard enough that she had the technical skills to handle tracks like that while still broadcasting personality all over them.\" He additionally noted that the album would pave the way for her sixth solo studio album *Lemonade* (2016), saying: \"When a full-grown Beyonc\u00e9 went back into accusatory mode years later on *Lemonade*, she had the weight of cultural memory working for her. We'd already known since she was a kid that she wasn't taking any bullshit.\"[17]\n\n\n*The Writing's on the Wall* has also been noted for its tremendous influence on artists in terms of lyrical themes, vocal performances and visuals. The album introduced staccato rap-singing, most notably on its tracks \"Bug a Boo\" and \"Say My Name\". In a 2006 interview for *The Guardian* upon the release of her second solo studio album *B'Day*, Beyonc\u00e9 claimed: \"That staccato, fast singing has kind of become the sound of R&B. It's still here in 2006. But we had no idea of what its impact would be. We had no idea that *The Writing's on the Wall* would be as big a record as it was. Especially worldwide.\"[11] Canadian rapper Drake was cited as one of the artists who sought vocal inspiration from the album, most notably on his 2013 track \"Girls Love Beyonc\u00e9\", on which James Fauntleroy sang the chorus of \"Say My Name\".[15][19] In a 2019 interview with *Vice*, Kandi Burruss\u2013one of the key contributors on the album\u2013said its feminist undertone-based influence was evident even two decades following its release, citing women's empowerment-themed efforts by artists such as Rihanna, Lizzo and Megan Thee Stallion.[121] The music videos for Kehlani's 2016 song \"Distraction\" and Tove Styrke's 2017 song \"Say My Name\" have also been described as homages to the music video for \"Say My Name\", further expanding the album's influence.[15]\n\n\n\n## Track listing[edit]\n\n\n***The Writing's on the Wall*** \u2013 Standard edition| No. | Title | Writer(s) | Producer(s) | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | \"Intro (The Writing's on the Wall)\" | * Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles\n* Kelly Rowland\n* LeToya Luckett\n* LaTavia Roberson\n | * Knowles\n* Donald Holmes\n* Gerard Thomas\n* Anthony Hardy\n | 2:05 |\n| 2. | \"So Good\" | * Knowles\n* Rowland\n* Luckett\n* Kandi\n* Roberson\n* Kevin Briggs\n | * Briggs[a]\n* Kandi[b]\n | 3:13 |\n| 3. | \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" | * Knowles\n* Rowland\n* Luckett\n* Kandi\n* Briggs\n | * Briggs[a]\n* Knowles[b]\n | 4:16 |\n| 4. | \"Confessions\" (featuring Missy Elliott) | * Holmes\n* Thomas\n* Melissa Elliott\n | * Elliott\n* Thomas[c]\n* Holmes[c]\n | 4:57 |\n| 5. | \"Bug a Boo\" | * Knowles\n* Rowland\n* Luckett\n* Roberson\n* Kandi\n* Briggs\n | * Briggs[a]\n* Kandi[b]\n | 3:32 |\n| 6. | \"Temptation\" | * Knowles\n* Rowland\n* Luckett\n* Roberson\n* Dwayne Wiggins\n* Carl Wheeler\n* Anthony Ray\n | * Wiggins\n* Terry T[c]\n | 4:05 |\n| 7. | \"Now That She's Gone\" | * Ken Fambro\n* Donnie Boynton\n* Tara Geter\n* Latrelle Simmons\n* Aleese Simmons\n | * Fambro\n* Boynton\n | 5:35 |\n| 8. | \"Where'd You Go\" | * Knowles\n* Rowland\n* Luckett\n* Roberson\n* Platinum Status\n* Chris Stokes\n | * Knowles\n* Platinum Status\n* Stokes\n | 4:15 |\n| 9. | \"Hey Ladies\" | * Knowles\n* Rowland\n* Luckett\n* Roberson\n* Kandi\n* Briggs\n | * Knowles[d]\n* Briggs[a]\n* Kandi[b]\n | 4:16 |\n| 10. | \"If You Leave\" (featuring Next) | * R.L.

It was released on April 25, 2001, by Columbia Records. As their breakthrough second studio album *The Writing's on the Wall* (1999) became a rising commercial success, Destiny's Child faced the controversial departure of original members LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson, who were replaced with Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams, in February 2000. Soon afterwards, they commenced production of their third studio album, tentatively titled *Independent Women*.\n\n\nMere five months after joining, Franklin departed from the group in July, and \"Independent Women Part I\" was subsequently released as a single from the accompanying soundtrack for the film *Charlie's Angels* (2000). The song became a global commercial success and the group's third US *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one single. Retitling the album *Survivor* in reference to the turmoil surrounding their line-up alterations, Destiny's Child enlisted producers such as Anthony Dent, Damon Elliott, Mark J. Feist, Rob Fusari and Keybeats alongside Beyonc\u00e9, who produced all and co-wrote nearly all of the album's tracks. Their final product was an R&B and pop record incorporating genres such as dance, funk and hip hop. Its lyrical themes explore dynamics between women, self-esteem, independence and romantic relationships.\n\n\nUpon its release, *Survivor* received generally positive reviews, mostly aimed at its production, while its balladry, length and lyrical content ignited criticism. Retrospective critical commentaries have credited the record for its impact on mainstream music of the 2000s and for serving as foundation for Beyonc\u00e9's solo career. A global commercial success, the album debuted atop the US *Billboard* 200 with first-week sales of 663,000 units, becoming Destiny's Child's first number-one album on the chart. It has gone on to be certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 44th Annual Grammy Awards (2002), the album was nominated for Best R&B Album. By 2004, it had sold over ten million copies worldwide, being among the best-selling girl group albums of all time.\n\n\n*Survivor* produced four singles. Its title track peaked at number two on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 and reached the top ten in 18 additional countries. In 2002, it won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. \"Bootylicious\" became Destiny's Child's fourth US *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one single and attained international success. \"Emotion\" became a US *Billboard* Hot 100 top-ten hit in the wake of the September 11 attacks, while \"Nasty Girl\" was released only overseas and achieved moderate success. The album was further promoted with the co-headlining Total Request Live Tour (2001) and the Destiny's Child World Tour (2002). After the latter's conclusion, the group embarked on a two-year hiatus, during which each member released a solo studio album to varying levels of success.\n\n\n\n\n## Background and development[edit]\n\n\nIn July 1999, Destiny's Child released their second studio album *The Writing's on the Wall*. Their breakthrough record, it debuted at number six on the US *Billboard* 200 with first-week sales of 133,000 units.[1] In December, LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson tried to split with Destiny's Child's manager Mathew Knowles, claiming that he was keeping too much of the group's profits and that he favored his daughter Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and Kelly Rowland.[2] When the accompanying music video for \"Say My Name\" premiered in February 2000, Roberson and Luckett found out that they were being replaced with Michelle Williams, a former backing vocalist for Monica, and Farrah Franklin, an aspiring singer-actress.[2] On March 15, Roberson and Luckett filed a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles and their former bandmates for breach of partnership and fiduciary duties.[3] Following the lawsuit, both sides were disparaging towards each other in the media.[2] However, the group's prominence and commercial success burgeoned, aided by \"Say My Name\", which peaked atop the US *Billboard* Hot 100. *The Writing's on the Wall* subsequently registered a significant rise in sales,[1] ascending towards a new peak at number five on the *Billboard* 200.[4]\n\n\nIn July 2000, it was announced that Franklin had departed Destiny's Child mere five months after joining. According to the group, Franklin missed a handful of promotional appearances and concerts and was asked to leave the group. However, Franklin stated that she quit because of negative energy within the group and her inability to assert any control in decision-making.[2] The group had already begun recording material for their third studio album, with Franklin performing backing vocals on several tracks. Among those was \"Independent Women Part I\", which was recorded for the accompanying soundtrack for the 2000 film *Charlie's Angels*.[5] The song was released as a single on August 29.[6] A global commercial success, it became the group's third US *Billboard* Hot 100 and first UK Singles Chart number-one single.[7][8] It was nominated for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[9] Towards the end of 2000, Roberson and Luckett dropped the portion of their lawsuit aimed at Beyonc\u00e9 and Rowland in exchange for a settlement, though they continued the action against Mathew Knowles. As part of the agreement, both sides were prohibited from speaking about each other publicly.[2]\n\n\n\n## Recording and production[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"There was not even 10 minutes between the albums, which I was kind of upset about at first. I felt like we needed a fair shot at making this record. We wanted a little more time to vibe the songs out and concentrate exclusively on the process of making this record. We didn't even have two consecutive days of recording. We did it completely on the fly. It was very hard, but it ultimately worked out well. It's a testimony to how close we've become as a group. We managed to have a great time working on this album as a team.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2013Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles reflecting on the production of *Survivor*.[10]\n\nThe recording sessions for *Survivor* commenced in May 2000 at the SugarHill Recording Studios in Houston, where most of the album was recorded. \"Gospel Medley\", which Destiny's Child had previewed during several public appearances throughout 2000,[11] was also recorded there;[12] the group decided to record it due to their longtime affinity for gospel.[13] As on the group's previous records, their manager Mathew Knowles served as the executive producer.[14] Initial tracks recorded for the album were in the vein of \"Jumpin', Jumpin'\", which was released as the fourth and final single from *The Writing's on the Wall* within that period, to tremendous commercial success. However, as the recording progressed, the group gradually added more depth to their work as there were \"so many people copping [their] sound, it was necessary to change things up a bit.\"[10] After emerging as the focal point of Destiny's Child, Knowles assumed more control by taking a greater hand in songwriting and even producing some of the album herself.[15] Knowles' intention was not to monopolize the spotlight; however, she did co-write 17 and produce all of the album's 18 tracks. She explained: \"I only wanted to do like three songs... The label kept saying \"Do another song, do another song, do another song\". It wasn't planned. It wasn't like I said, OK, I'm going to take charge.\"[16] However, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams co-wrote only one track\u2013\"Outro (DC-3) Thank You\".[13] On July 20, Farrah Franklin departed from Destiny's Child,[17] having already recorded backing vocals for several tracks, including \"Independent Women Part I\".[18] The group embarked on Christina Aguilera's tour Christina Aguilera in Concert as an opening act on July 31, touring until October and simultaneously recording the album.[19] Six songs, including both parts to \"Independent Women\", \"Nasty Girl\" and the unreleased \"I Tried\", had been recorded by September.[20]\n\n\nOriginally, the Keybeats-produced \"Independent Women Part II\" was recorded first as the song's album version, while the track which would become \"Independent Women Part I\" served as a remix.[5] However, their roles were reversed as the group was offered to record material for the accompanying soundtrack to *Charlie's Angels* (2000), a film adaption of the 1976\u20131981 television series of the same title. They re-recorded \"Independent Women\" and enlisted first-time collaborators Trackmasters to produce the track, altering the original's lyrics to suit the *Charlie's Angels* theme.[18] Cory Rooney, who co-wrote and produced the re-recording, said it took only 15 minutes for him and the Trackmasters to create the instrumental track.[21] Aside from the SugarHill Recording Studios, part one was recorded at the Lobo Studios in Deer Park, New York and the TK Studios in Honolulu, while part two was recorded at the Chung King Studios in New York City and the 24/7 Studios in Houston.[14] The Anthony Dent-produced title track was inspired by a pun a radio station had made about the fact that three members had already left Destiny's Child, comparing the group to the reality competition television series *Survivor*. Knowles felt inspired to use the negative comment and turn its context positive by writing a song out of it.[22] According to Williams, the song was recorded from September to November.[10] It was recorded at the Chase Studios in Atlanta\u2013where fellow Dent production was also recorded\u2013and, alongside numerous other tracks, at the Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Survivor* was Destiny's Child's first album to be recorded with Michelle Williams (pictured) after she joined the group in February 2000. Her sole songwriting credit on the album is for \"Outro (DC-3) Thank You\".\nBeyonc\u00e9 claimed to have written \"Bootylicious\" on a plane flight to London while listening to the song \"Edge of Seventeen\" by Stevie Nicks, when the word \"bootylicious\" popped into her head.[16] Rob Fusari disputed the claim in 2010, stating he himself had the idea for the song and had wanted to use a guitar riff from Survivor's 1982 song \"Eye of the Tiger\" but, after not being able to find it, used a similar riff from \"Edge of Seventeen\".[23] However, in 2016, he revealed that after the \"Edge of Seventeen\" sample was approved, he conceived the song with Beyonc\u00e9 over the phone, adding: \"She was out of the country at that point, but she had the 'Bootylicious' concept in her head. That was totally her. She knew what she wanted to say. It was very urban pop angle that they were taking on the record.\"[24] Once the group decided to record \"Bootylicious\", Fusari wanted to remove the sample, explaining: \"I figured I'd put the guitar loop on there temporarily, and later go into the studio with a guitar and replay it, because I'd learned, after sampling Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" for Will Smith's \"Wild Wild West,\" that I didn't want to lose 50% of the publishing. I vividly remember telling Mathew Knowles, \"Mathew, you got to book me into your studio and let me replay that riff.\" It was Guitar 101! One note!\"; however, Knowles refused.[23] Dan Workman, who engineered several tracks from *Survivor*, commented on the recording sessions: \"Beyonc\u00e9 would be driving over to the studio listening to all these tracks that had been sent to her, and she would pick out her favorite. When she got here, she would immediately start writing lyrics for the song and finish it right there in front of me. For the song \"Bootylicious\" she wrote all the lyrics for it right in [SugarHill Recording Studios'] Studio A. Then she taught the song to Kelly and Michelle, and all three of them worked on the vocals together.\"[12]\n\n\nD'wayne Wiggins, who wrote \"Fancy\" with Beyonc\u00e9 and J. R. Rotem, said Destiny's Child would carefully select lyrics for the songs, adjusting them to suit the group. According to Wiggins, they would \"just take a song and dissect it and put it back together again. For \"Fancy,\" it took [only] about 30 or 45 minutes to change the hook.\"[21] Rotem reflected on the song's simple instrumentation, revealing he created beats solely using a keyboard and a drum machine.[21] The song was recorded at the Digital Services in Houston, with additional recording at the House of Music in Oakland, California.[14] Mark J. Feist, who produced \"Emotion\", changed the arrangement and production of Samantha Sang's disco-soul 1977 original version into a contemporary ballad.[21] Beyonc\u00e9 would re-record \"Dangerously in Love\" with a modified arrangement for her 2003 debut solo studio album of the same title.[25] Both versions were recorded at the SugarHill Recording Studios, and were written and produced by Beyonc\u00e9 and Errol McCalla Jr.[14][26][27] As *Survivor* neared its completion in December 2000, Destiny's Child referred to their hectic schedule while recording the album, revealing they took time off recording solely on Christmas Day. While they intended to complete the album soon afterwards, the recording continued into early 2001, causing the album's release date to be postponed and its lead single \"Survivor\" to be delayed from January to March.[28] During the album's production, Rowland recorded her debut solo recording \"Angel\".[15] Produced by Beyonc\u00e9, Fusari and Falonte Moore\u2013who wrote and produced \"Bootylicious\", \"Apple Pie \u00e0 la Mode\" and \"Happy Face\"\u2013the track appeared on the accompanying soundtrack for the 2001 film *Down to Earth*.[29] Previous collaborator Rodney Jerkins, whose production \"Say My Name\" became one of Destiny's Child's biggest hits, had also returned to work on *Survivor*. He produced two tracks, including the \"street-edgy\", up-tempo \"Girl Like Me\", but neither made the final track listing.[30]\n\n\n\n## Music and lyrics[edit]\n\n\n*Survivor* is predominantly an R&B and pop record exploring genres such as hip hop, funk and dance.[31][32][33][34] Its lyrical themes include dynamics between women, self-esteem, independence and romantic relationships.[35][36] The album opens with the uptempo club track \"Independent Women Part I\", which encourages female empowerment and financial independence. As it was recorded for the accompanying soundtrack for *Charlie's Angels* (2000), it makes numerous lyrical references to the film.[18] The album's title track features looped strings built around an \"abrasive\" hip hop instrumental.[30][36] Lyrically, it's considered a \"prolonged and rather vindictive attack\" on the former members of Destiny's Child\u2013LeToya Luckett, LaTavia Roberson and Farrah Franklin.[37] The \"blinding Prince-like R&B-jazz odyssey\" \"Bootylicious\" features a lyrical response to those who had criticized Beyonc\u00e9's weight gain, against a prominent guitar riff sample from Stevie Nicks' 1981 song \"Edge of Seventeen\".[31][38] \"Nasty Girl\" features the group \"hurling insults at a hip-hop harlot\",[34] while dismissing \"classless\" women altogether.[39] It features an uncredited interpolation of Salt-N-Pepa's 1986 song \"Push It\".[40] Pizzicato string-driven \"Fancy\" is seen as another diss track directed towards the group's former members.[37][33]\n\n\nAvant-funk track \"Apple Pie \u00e0 la Mode\" features \"percolating\" beats and harmonies,[34][33] while the dance track \"Sexy Daddy\" is infused with discordant harmonies and \"thundering\" ragga beats.[37] \"Independent Women Part II\" sonically differs from its counterpart, featuring modified lyrics against a cartoonish bounce background.[18] The \"sunny day\" pop track \"Happy Face\" promotes self-esteem; Sylvia Patterson from *NME* classified its genre as \"cajun-R&B-yodel-pop\".[33][35] A string of ballads subsequently appears, including a \"slow jam\" cover version of Samantha Sang's 1977 song \"Emotion\",[33] as well as the \"soft\" \"Dangerously in Love\" and the easy listening love song \"Brown Eyes\".[36][34] Brian Hiatt from MTV described the latter as \"a gently harmonized love song, with production reminiscent of the Janet Jackson hit \"Again.\"\"[30] \"The Story of Beauty\" lyrically differs from the rest of *Survivor*, telling a story about a victim of sexual abuse; it was based on a fan who wrote a letter to the group.[41] Beyonc\u00e9 described it as \"a pretty controversial yet realistic song that deals with something that happens in most families that no one wants to talk about.\"[30] A cappella gospel track \"Gospel Medley\" comprises the Beyonc\u00e9-written \"You've Been So Good\", Kirk Franklin's \"Now Behold the Lamb\", the Christian hymn \"Jesus Loves Me\", and Richard Smallwood's \"Total Praise\".[34][42][43] The album closes with \"Outro (DC-3) Thank You\", on which the members congratulate, praise and thank each other.[33][37]\n\n\n\n## Title and packaging[edit]\n\n\nOriginally titled *Independent Women* after \"Independent Women Part I\", the album was later retitled *Survivors*, as Destiny's Child branded themselves \"survivors\" in reference to the turmoil that had coincided with the group throughout 2000.[28] The title was later altered to *Survivor*. Beyonc\u00e9 further explained: \"I thought about this joke that this radio station had, and they were saying, 'Oh, Destiny's Child is like \"Survivor,\" trying to see which member is going to last the longest on the island,' and everyone laughed. I was like, 'Ah, that's cute, but you know what? I'm going to use that negative thing and turn it into a positive thing and try to write a great song out of it.'\"[22]\n\n\nThe cover artwork for *Survivor* was photographed by Rod Spicer, with the group styled by Beyonc\u00e9's mother Tina Knowles.[14] Biographer Daryl Easlea noted the cover \"showing the group now as women rather than the girls of the previous sleeves\".[44] The album's booklet included a photograph of the members looking \"triumphal\" standing on rocks on a desert island, inspired by the reality television series *Survivor*, as a reference to the album's title and title track.[44]\n\n\n\n## Release and promotion[edit]\n\n\n*Survivor* was originally slated for February 13, 2001,[45] before being postponed to April,[30] and afterwards to its ultimate release date of May 1.[10] Its promotional activities commenced on February 28, when Destiny's Child performed the lead single \"Survivor\" for the first time at the 2001 Soul Train Music Awards.[46] The song was subsequently performed on the April 6 episode of *Top of the Pops* in the United Kingdom,[47] with \"Emotion\" on *Saturday Night Live* on May 5,[48] on *Late Show with David Letterman* on May 10,[49] and with \"Bootylicious\" on *Today* on May 11.[50] The group additionally performed the album's first three singles \"Survivor\", \"Bootylicious\" and \"Emotion\" on *The Early Show* on June 6.[51] They subsequently opened the inaugural BET Awards with \"Bootylicious\" on June 19,[52] later performing the song on the August 3 episode of *Top of the Pops* and the September 7 Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration show.[47][53] In the meantime, the group had embarked on the co-headlining Total Request Live Tour with 3LW, Dream, Eve and Nelly with the St. Lunatics, which ran throughout North America from July 18 until September 21.[54] Afterwards, their own European tour was scheduled to run from October 24 to November 20, but was postponed in the wake of the September 11 attacks.[55]\n\n\nFollowing the tour's postponement, Destiny's Child performed \"Survivor\", \"Emotion\" and \"Gospel Medley\" during the benefit concert United We Stand: What More Can I Give, led by Michael Jackson in tribute to victims of the September 11 attacks, on October 21.[56] Within subsequent months, the group focused on the overseas promotion of *Survivor*, performing \"Emotion\" on the November 23 episode of *Top of the Pops* in the UK and the December 15 episode of *Wetten, dass..?* in Germany,[47][57] \"Survivor\" during the Sanremo Music Festival 2002 in Italy on March 8,[58] and \"Bootylicious\" at the Logie Awards of 2002 in Australia on April 28.[59] Also, their first remix album, titled *This Is the Remix*, was released on March 12 and included remixes of several tracks from *Survivor* among other tracks;[60] it debuted at number 29 on the US *Billboard* 200.[61] The postponed Destiny's Child World Tour commenced on April 29, being expanded from solely Europe to Oceania and Japan as well, and finished on June 24.[55][62] Its Rotterdam show was filmed and released via video album *Destiny's Child World Tour* on July 8, 2003.[63]\n\n\n\n## Singles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Guitar riff from \"Edge of Seventeen\" by Stevie Nicks (pictured) was sampled on \"Bootylicious\". Nicks would later appear in the song's accompanying music video, playing the sampled riff.\n\"Survivor\" was released as the lead single from *Survivor* on March 6, 2001, to mixed critical reception.[64][65] A commercial success, it became Destiny's Child's fourth consecutive US *Billboard* Hot 100 top-three single, peaking at number two.[7] The digital single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in July 2020.[66] Internationally, the song reached the summit in Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom, and the top ten in 15 additional countries.[67][68][69] Despite a mixed critical response, it won Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards (2002), marking Destiny's Child's third and final Grammy Award win as a group.[9] Its Darren Grant-directed accompanying music video depicts the members as shipwreck survivors on a desert island.[70] The video was released as the group's first DVD single, which peaked at number nine on the US Top Music Videos and was certified gold by the RIAA.[71][66] At the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, the video won Best R&B Video,[72] also being nominated for Best Pop Video and Best Group Video.[73]\n\n\n\"Bootylicious\" was released as the second single from *Survivor* on May 22, 2001.[74] Commercially, it fared similarly to its predecessor, becoming Destiny's Child's fourth and final US *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one single.[7][n] The digital single was certified platinum by the RIAA in July 2020.[66] Internationally, the song reached the top ten in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the UK.[75][76][8] Its Matthew Rolston-directed accompanying music video showcases the group performing numerous of Michael Jackson's choreographies and features Stevie Nicks playing the guitar riff sampled from her song \"Edge of Seventeen\".[70]\n\n\n\"Emotion\" was released as the third single from *Survivor* on September 4, 2001.[77] A commercial success, it continued Destiny's Child's streak of US *Billboard* Hot 100 top-ten singles by peaking at number ten after being fueled by post-September 11 attacks airplay.[7][21] Internationally, it peaked within the top ten in Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa and the UK.[78][79][80][81][8] Its Francis Lawrence-directed accompanying music video features the members' respective situations through a triple-split screen; Beyonc\u00e9 deals with an adulterous boyfriend, Kelly Rowland deals with separation from her boyfriend, while Michelle Williams deals with the death of her grandmother.[70]\n\n\n\"Nasty Girl\" was released as the fourth and final single from *Survivor* outside North America on March 4, 2002,[82] to negative critical reception.[34][32] A moderate commercial success, it peaked at number ten in Australia and within the top 40 in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.[83] Its Sanaa Hamri-directed accompanying music video depicts women perceived as \"nasty girls\" receiving transformations.[84] In 2016, Rob Fusari, who produced several tracks from *Survivor*, revealed \"Happy Face\" was originally slated as the album's final single, but those plans were scrapped due to the song's lyrical content being deemed inappropriate in the wake of the September 11 attacks.[21]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nProfessional ratings| Aggregate scores |\n| --- |\n| Source | Rating |\n| Metacritic | 63/100[85] |\n| Review scores |\n| Source | Rating |\n| *Blender* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[86] |\n| *Entertainment Weekly* | B+[33] |\n| *The Guardian* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[37] |\n| *Los Angeles Times* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[87] |\n| *NME* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[31] |\n| *Q* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[88] |\n| *Rolling Stone* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[90] |\n| *Spin* | 9/10[91] |\n| *Vibe* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[92] |\n| *The Village Voice* | ![(2-star Honorable Mention)](image)![(2-star Honorable Mention)](image)[89] |\n\n\n*Survivor* received generally favorable reviews from music critics upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 63 out of 100, based on 17 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[85] Writing for *Entertainment Weekly*, David Browne praised the record, calling it \"the divas' premature, but inevitable growing pains album.\"[33] *Spin* commented that \"*Survivor* is relentlessly inventive in its recombinations.\"[91] Ethan Brown from *New York* was less impressed, writing: \"All fifteen tracks are one-dimensional disses and dismissals of scantily clad women, vengeful boyfriends, and the group's assorted doubters.\"[93] Sylvia Patterson from *NME* summarized the album as \"Multi-platinum booty-shakers in boundary-pushing nil-shit-taking\u00a0exercise\", while highlighting \"Independent Women Part I\".[31] Natalie Nichols from *Los Angeles Times* described it as a \"generic hip-hop music box of ticking percussion, pulsing bass and uninspiring samples [which] barely allows [Destiny's Child] a moment to breathe, let alone stretch out\".[87]\n\n\nDespite criticizing its length, lyrical content and balladry, Alexis Petridis from *The Guardian* wrote that *Survivor* \"has a rare individuality, and a hint of genius, hidden in its grooves\".[37] Nathan Rabin from *The A.V. Club* shared Petridis' negative sentiments, concluding his review by saying: \"if the group wants to survive the stormy seas of the pop world for more than a few years, it should call its stable of songwriting wizards ASAP\".[34] In a positive review, Crist\u00edn Leach from RT\u00c9 highlighted \"The Story of Beauty\" while dismissing the album's closing tracks \"Gospel Medley\" and \"Outro (DC-3) Thank You\".[42] Laura Sinagra from *Blender* wrote: \"Aside from disposable ballads and the sappy \"Perfect Man,\" *Survivor* blasts haters, child molesters and \"been-around-the-block-females,\" keeping the blood up as they whup ass.\"[86] Sal Cinquemani from *Slant Magazine* expressed that \"for the most part *Survivor* rises to the occasion, and while the album isn't groundbreaking, it at least shows the new trio breaking out on their own.\"[32] Rob Sheffield from *Rolling Stone* praised the album but singled \"the self-righteous tone creeping into the songs\" out as its sole weakness.[90]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nFor the complete list of awards won by Destiny's Child and the singles from *Survivor*, see List of awards and nominations received by Destiny's Child.\n\n### Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nAwards and nominations for *Survivor*\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category | Nominee(s)\n | Result | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001 | Teen Choice Award | Choice Music \u2013 Album\n | *Survivor* | Nominated\n | [94]\n |\n| 2002 | American Music Award | Favorite Pop/Rock Album | Won\n | [95]\n |\n| 2002 | Grammy Award | Best R&B Album | Nominated\n | [9]\n |\n| 2002 | Soul Train Music Award | Best R&B/Soul Album \u2013 Group, Band or Duo | Nominated\n | [96]\n |\n| 2002\n | TMF Award | Best Album\n | Won\n | [97]\n |\n| Soul Train Lady of Soul Award | Best R&B/Soul Album by a Group, Band or Duo\n | Won\n | [98]\n |\n\n\n### Listings[edit]\n\n\n\n\nListings for *Survivor*\n| Year\n | Publication\n | List\n | Position\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | *Aftonbladet* | Albums of the Year\n | 15\n | [99]\n |\n| *Blender* | 9\n |\n| *The Face* | Recordings of the Year\n | 18\n | [100]\n |\n| *Musikexpress* | Albums of the Year\n | 15\n | [99]\n |\n| *NME* | Albums of 2001\n | 15\n | [101]\n |\n| *OOR* | Jaarlijst 2001\n | 41\n | [102]\n |\n| Playlouder | Best Albums of 2001\n | 46\n | [99]\n |\n| 2007\n | *The Guardian* | 1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die\n | \u2013\n |\n| 2009\n | *Adresseavisen* | Top 100 Albums of the 2000s\n | 98\n |\n| *The Guardian* | OMM's Top 50 Albums of the Decade\n | 49\n | [103]\n |\n| 2010\n | *1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die* | \u2013\n | [104]\n |\n| 2023\n | *Rolling Stone* (Germany)\n | The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\n | 384\n | [105] [106]\n |\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, *Survivor* debuted atop the *Billboard* 200 chart dated May 19, 2001, with first-week sales of 663,000 units.[107] It also debuted atop the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, selling over 87,000 copies at the R&B core stores within its first week.[108] Destiny's Child's first number-one album on both charts, it registered the highest first-week sales for any Columbia Records artist at the time.[109] Despite a 46% sales decline to 358,979 units, the album remained at the summit in its second week, reaching the one-million sales mark.[110] In its third week, the album descended to number three, selling 221,884 copies; in total, it spent 14 consecutive weeks within the top ten.[111][112] By the end of 2001, *Survivor* had sold over 3.7 million copies, becoming the seventh best-selling album of the year.[113] It was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 7, 2002.[114] By November 2005, the album had sold over 4.7 million units in the US, being one of the best-selling girl group albums ever in the country.[o] In Canada, the album debuted atop the Canadian Albums Chart, spending four weeks at the summit.[115] In October 2003, it was certified quadruple platinum by Music Canada.[116]\n\n\nAcross Europe, *Survivor* reached the summit in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland.[117][118][119][120] On the European Top 100 Albums, it debuted at number 49 and peaked atop the chart the following week.[121] In 2001, the record was certified double platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for sales of two million units across Europe.[122] In the United Kingdom, the album debuted atop the UK Albums Chart, UK R&B Albums Chart and Scottish Albums Chart, with first-week sales of 118,000 copies.[123][124][125][126] It became the first studio album by an American girl group to peak atop the UK Albums Chart and made Destiny's Child the second American girl group in history to reach the summit, following The Supremes, who did so with their greatest hits albums *Greatest Hits* (1967) and *20 Golden Greats* (1977).[126] British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it triple platinum in December 2001.[127]\n\n\nIn Australia, *Survivor* debuted and peaked at number four on the ARIA Top 100 Albums,[117] and was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) in December 2001.[128] In New Zealand, it debuted at number ten, ascending towards its peak at number five in its second week.[129] The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) in 2002.[130] In Japan, it peaked at number 12 on the Oricon Albums Chart,[131] being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) in May 2001.[132] In South Africa, the album reached number one and, in 2002, was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry of South Africa (RISA).[133] According to IFPI, *Survivor* was the third best-selling album worldwide of 2001,[134] with 7.8 million copies sold during the year.[135] By November 2004, *Survivor* had sold over ten million copies worldwide, being the fifth best-selling girl group album of all time.[136]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)LeToya Luckett (pictured) and LaTavia Roberson filed their second lawsuit against Destiny's Child in response to the lyrical content of \"Survivor\", which they perceived as a violation of a prior agreement.\n*Survivor* was a subject of several controversies, albeit less than its predecessor *The Writing's on the Wall* (1999). Rob Fusari, who wrote \"Bootylicious\", recalled a dispute with Destiny's Child's manager and Beyonc\u00e9's father Mathew Knowles over the song's conception. In an interview with Barbara Walters, Beyonc\u00e9 had discussed how she came up with the idea for the song herself. Upon seeing that, Fusari called Knowles, describing the conversation:\n\n\n\n\n> And he explained to me, in a nice way, he said, \"People don't want to hear about Rob Fusari, producer from Livingston, N.J. No offense, but that's not what sells records. What sells records is people believing that the artist is everything.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, I know, Mathew. I understand the game. But come on, I'm trying too. I'm a squirrel trying to get a nut, too.\"[23]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe lyrical content of \"Survivor\" caused backlash from LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson, who had controversially departed from the group in February 2000 and filed a lawsuit against the group and their management soon afterwards. The portion of the lawsuit directed towards Beyonc\u00e9 and Kelly Rowland had been dropped by the end of the year, with a mutual agreement prohibiting either party involved from making \"any public comment of a disparaging nature concerning one another\".[2][137] Luckett and Roberson contended the line \"You thought I wouldn't sell without you, sold 9 million\" violated the agreement and filed another lawsuit against the group in February 2002, accusing Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland and Michelle Williams of making \"deliberate disparaging, defamatory factual misrepresentations\" in the song, as well as in their statements for the press surrounding the release of *Survivor*.[137] By late July, the parties had reached a settlement out of court.[138]\n\n\n\n## Impact and legacy[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRetrospective professional ratings| Review scores |\n| --- |\n| Source | Rating |\n| AllMusic | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[40] |\n| *The Encyclopedia of Popular Music* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[139] |\n| *The Rolling Stone Album Guide* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[140] |\n\n\nRetrospectively, *Survivor* has received mixed to positive critical commentary, with criticism directed towards its lyrical content, and praise towards its thematic impact on mainstream music of the 2000s.[141] Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote for AllMusic: \"*Survivor*, their first album as full-fledged superstars \u2013 also their first album since most of the group disappeared due to managerial conflicts \u2013 is as contrived and calculated as a Mariah Carey record, only without the joy. This is a determined, bullheaded record, intent on proving Destiny's Child has artistic merit largely because the group survived internal strife.\"[40] On the contrary, J'na Jefferson from *Vibe* declared the album \"a seminal force in the female empowerment trend of the 21st century, serving as a love letter to body-positive, independent and fierce women all over the globe.\"[141] Furthermore, Vincent Anthony from The 97 credited the record for \"unbiasedly [melding] R&B inspirations and hip-hop nuances into an [*sic*] unique brand of pop that defined the early 2000s\".[35] From a standpoint concerning pop culture, Nathan Brackett and Christian Hoard wrote that the album \"helped establish [Destiny's Child] as an American institution\" in *The New Rolling Stone Album Guide* (2004).[140] Its second single \"Bootylicious\" popularized the portmanteau term \"bootylicious\", a combination of the words \"booty\" and \"delicious\", although the term had already been used by Snoop Dogg on Dr. Dre's 1992 song \"Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')\" as a pejorative.[24] As Destiny's Child brought the term's neologism of approval to prominence, it consequently entered the mainstream English language, thus being added to the *Oxford English Dictionary* in 2004, referring to a sexually attractive woman in its definition.[142] Following the September 11 attacks, the lead single \"Survivor\" received new lyrical interpretations from the public, being called a \"tool for national grief in a way to show solidarity and strength\".[21] \"Emotion\", which was released as the third single around the time of the attacks, was also branded a \"healing song\", which contributed to its commercial success in the United States.[21]\n\n\nAs previously announced,[28] following the completion of promotional duties for *Survivor*, Destiny's Child embarked on a hiatus in 2002, in order for its members to release solo albums.[143][p] Michelle Williams was first to release a solo album, titled *Heart to Yours*, in April 2002. The critically acclaimed gospel record debuted at number 57 on the US *Billboard* 200 with first-week sales of 17,000 copies.[145] It has since sold 220,000 copies in the US, as of 2008.[146] Although Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles' solo album was initially scheduled for October 2002, its release was postponed due to the success of Kelly Rowland's collaboration with Nelly, \"Dilemma\". The song reached the summit of the US *Billboard* Hot 100, thus Rowland's pop rock-oriented solo debut *Simply Deep* was moved up to October from its original early 2003 release date.[147] *Simply Deep* debuted at number 12 on the US *Billboard* 200, selling 77,000 units within its first week and going on to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[148][149] \"Dilemma\" additionally won Rowland her first Grammy Award outside the group, for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards (2003).[150] Following numerous postponements, Beyonc\u00e9 was the last to release a solo album. Titled *Dangerously in Love*, it was released in June 2003 to widespread critical acclaim.[151] The album debuted atop the US *Billboard* 200 and registered the highest first-week sales among the members with 317,000 units.[152] It was preceded by the lead single \"Crazy in Love\", which spent eight consecutive weeks atop the US *Billboard* Hot 100. \"Crazy in Love\" was followed by \"Baby Boy\", which surpassed its predecessor's reign at the summit by one week, and the top-five hits \"Me, Myself and I\" and \"Naughty Girl\".[153] At the 46th Annual Grammy Awards (2004), *Dangerously in Love* and its tracks won five awards, including Best Contemporary R&B Album; Beyonc\u00e9 consequently tied with Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys and Norah Jones for the record of most Grammy Awards won by a woman at a single ceremony.[q] Following the release of her sixth solo studio album *Lemonade* (2016), Sasha Geffen from MTV claimed \"*Survivor* marked [Beyonc\u00e9]'s turning point from musician to global phenomenon\", drawing parallels between lyrical themes of tracks from *Survivor* and those from *Lemonade*.[109]\n\n\n\n## Track listing[edit]\n\n\n*Survivor*\u00a0\u2013 Standard edition| No. | Title | Writer(s) | Producer(s) | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | \"Independent Women Part I\" | * Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles\n* Samuel Barnes\n* Cory Rooney\n* Jean-Claude Olivier\n | * B.

Most of them are re-arranged with up-tempo beats in a contemporary R&B style. The album was recorded in Summer 2001 in the United States, but Kelly Rowland stated during the \"8 Days of Christmas\" video premiere on BET's *106 & Park* in Fall 2001 that parts of the album were also recorded in Japan during Destiny's Child's overseas promo tour. In the same interview, Beyonc\u00e9 revealed, \"Actually we wrote the song two years ago when we went in the studio to do some Christmas something. That's what started the idea of doing a Christmas album.\"[1] The song \"8 Days of Christmas\" first appeared on the double-disc reissue of *The Writing's on the Wall* in November 2000.\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nProfessional ratings| Review scores |\n| --- |\n| Source | Rating |\n| AllMusic | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[2] |\n| *The Encyclopedia of Popular Music* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[3] |\n| *Entertainment Weekly* | B+[4] |\n| *People* | mixed[5] |\n| *Slant Magazine* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[6] |\n\n\n*8 Days of Christmas* received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, gave the album 2.5 out 5 stars. In his review, he felt that it did not offer anything different from any other Christmas album and that it had the same formula as every other Christmas album, making it very predictable.[2] Chris Willman of *Entertainment Weekly* gave the album a B+. He felt that the album had a rough start, stating that song lyrics such as, \"a pair of Chloe shades and a diamond belly ring\" were too materialistic, leaving a bad taste in your mouth, however, he stated that originals like \"Winter Christmas\", and \"This Christmas\" helped the album quickly recover.[7] *People* gave the album a mixed review, stating that some songs of the album fell short, but despite that, there were a few gifts on the album, such as \"Carol of the Bells\". They came to the conclusion that while it was good, it was not destined for success.[5] Alexa Camp of *Slant Magazine* gave the album 2.5 out of 5 stars. She said that the album sounded like a, \"Survivor II: Winter Ghetto-chic,\" and that the album brought little justice to the original songs.[6]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\n*8 Days of Christmas* made its debut on the *Billboard* 200 at number 59.[8] On the chart issue dated December 22, 2001, it reached its peak at number 34. On December 3, 2001, the album was certified Platinum in 2020 by the  Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) denoting shipments of 1,000,000 copies.[9]\n\n\n\n## Track listing[edit]\n\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes[10]\n\n\n\n***8 Days of Christmas*** \u2013 Standard edition| No. | Title | Writer(s) | Producer(s) | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | \"8 Days of Christmas\" | * Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles\n* Kelly Rowland\n* Errol McCalla\n | * B.

It was released on November 16, 2004, by Columbia Records and Sony Urban Music. Following the conclusion of promotional activities for their globally successful third studio album *Survivor* (2001), Destiny's Child embarked on a two-year hiatus, during which each member released solo albums to varying levels of success. They reunited in the summer of 2004 to record *Destiny Fulfilled*, primarily at the Sony Music Studios in New York City. Unlike the group's previous recordings, the album saw each member equally contributing to the songwriting and production, drawing inspiration from the events in their lives while being apart.\n\n\nExecutive producing *Destiny Fulfilled* alongside their manager Mathew Knowles, Destiny's Child further worked with frequent collaborators such as Rockwilder and Rodney Jerkins, as well as several new ones, including 9th Wonder, Sean Garrett and Rich Harrison. Their efforts resulted with an R&B record further exploring genres such as crunk, dance, hip hop and funk. Lyrically a concept album, each of its tracks is a continuation of its predecessor, altogether telling a complete story tracing a woman's relationship journey. The balladry and lyrical content were met with generally mixed reviews from music critics, who nevertheless praised the equality of contributions among members and their vocal performances.\n\n\nA highly-anticipated comeback album, *Destiny Fulfilled* went through several release date alterations due to a concern over Internet leaks, ultimately being released a day earlier. Its street date violation resulted with a premature debut at number 19 on the US *Billboard* 200. The album's sales were principally unaffected by the unconventional release as it subsequently peaked at number two, selling 558,000 units within its first eight days of release, and went on to be certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Despite its mixed critical reception, the album garnered five Grammy Award nominations, including Best Contemporary R&B Album. One of the best-selling girl group albums of all time, the album has sold over seven million copies worldwide.\n\n\n*Destiny Fulfilled* produced four singles. \"Lose My Breath\" and \"Soldier\" both peaked at number three on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 and achieved widespread international commercial success. \"Girl\" peaked only at number 23 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 but was a top-ten hit in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, \"Cater 2 U\" fared better on the US *Billboard* Hot 100, peaking at number 14. Destiny's Child further promoted the album with their world tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It (2005). During the tour's Palau Sant Jordi show in Barcelona on June 11, 2005, the group announced their disbandment; they formally disbanded following the release of the live album *Live in Atlanta* (2006).\n\n\n\n\n## Background and development[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"People ask why. We're friends. We enjoy each other. We sound good together. We grew up together and hopefully we can set an example for other groups, and other female groups especially, that you can support each other and not be insecure and be happy for one another. And it's OK to do solo projects and to grow up and get a life. But it's also OK to come back together... It doesn't always have to be what the media tries to make it out to be. Women can get along and be businesswomen and be smart and not be catty all the time.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Beyonc\u00e9 reflecting on the motives behind Destiny's Child's reunion.[1]\n\nIn April 2001, Destiny's Child released their highly-anticipated third studio album *Survivor*. Fueled by the widespread commercial success of \"Independent Women Part I\" and \"Survivor\",[2] it became their first US *Billboard* 200 number-one album.[3] The album sold steadily and went on to be certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[4] Furthermore, it was nominated for Best R&B Album at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards (2002),[5] and has sold over ten million copies worldwide.[6] While recording *Survivor* in December 2000, Beyonc\u00e9 announced that Destiny's Child would eventually embark on a hiatus which would allow each member to release a solo album, which they hoped would further increase interest in the group.[7] The idea of solo albums emanated from the group's manager and Beyonc\u00e9's father Mathew Knowles. Kelly Rowland further explained in an interview that Destiny's Child had been present in the media for a long time and they wanted to \"give the public eye a rest from DC for a minute\".[8] During that same interview, she acknowledged that the trio would reunite during the fall of 2003 to start recording a new album.[8]\n\n\nDuring the hiatus, Michelle Williams released two gospel studio albums\u2013*Heart to Yours* (2002) and *Do You Know* (2004). The former peaked atop the US *Billboard* Top Gospel Albums chart,[9] becoming 2002's biggest selling gospel album; with over 220,000 copies sold in the US[10] and 500,000 worldwide.[11] Furthermore, Williams won a British MOBO Award for \"Best Gospel Act\" in 2002 and made her Broadway debut, as the leading actor in the musical *Aida* on November 18, 2003.[12] Although Beyonc\u00e9's solo album was initially scheduled for October 2002, its release was postponed due to the success of Kelly Rowland's collaboration with Nelly, \"Dilemma\", which peaked atop the US *Billboard* Hot 100 for an accumalative 10 weeks[13] and won a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards.[14] Therefore, Rowland's pop rock-oriented solo debut *Simply Deep* was moved up to October, ahead of Beyonc\u00e9's album.[15] *Simply Deep* debuted at number 12 on the US *Billboard* 200, and has gone on to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[16][17] Beyonc\u00e9, who was the last member to release an album, was regarded the most successful with *Dangerously in Love* (2003). The album debuted atop the US *Billboard* 200, enjoying international commercial success and widespread critical acclaim.[18] Furthermore, it produced two US *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one hits\u2013\"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\"[19]\u2013and won five Grammy Awards at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards (2004), causing Beyonc\u00e9 to tie for winning the most Grammy Awards at a single ceremony among women.[f] The members' respective solo achievements led to intense speculation over the disbandment of Destiny's Child. In July 2004, amidst the rumors, Rowland announced the group's return to the studio to record *Destiny Fulfilled*. The group claimed the reunion was destined to happen, and that their affinity for each other kept them together.[1][21]\n\n\n\n## Recording and production[edit]\n\n\nProduction of *Destiny Fulfilled* commenced during the summer of 2004, with Destiny's Child enlisting frequent collaborators such as Rockwilder and Rodney Jerkins, as well as new ones, including 9th Wonder, Sean Garrett and Rich Harrison. 9th Wonder initially met Beyonc\u00e9 while she was in the recording studio as her now-husband, rapper Jay-Z recorded the song \"Threat\" for his album *The Black Album* (2003). After Jay-Z went through the CD of tracks 9th Wonder had handed to him, Beyonc\u00e9 mentioned that she liked what she heard from him. Several months later, 9th Wonder received a call from Jay-Z, asking for him to give the CD to Destiny's Child. He was surprised at being contacted by the rapper about working with the group, as he confessed that he had never owned an album by them. He later traveled to Los Angeles to work with the trio for their next album. During the three-day session, he produced the songs \"Girl\", \"Is She the Reason\" and \"Game Over\".[22] Garrett, who co-wrote \"Lose My Breath\", \"Soldier\", \"T-Shirt\", \"Is She the Reason\", \"Girl\" and \"Through with Love\", recalled working on the album: \"There was so much magic going on in the studio. We probably recorded all the songs in about a month and every day it was a new song coming out. 'Lose My Breath' was towards the latter part of the album and that was an amazing song that we felt could not only be big on the radio but big with bands and marching bands. I was on a natural high after that.\"[23]\n\n\nDestiny's Child recorded *Destiny Fulfilled* within a three-week period,[1] mostly at the Sony Music Studios in New York City, where all tracks except \"Through with Love\" were recorded.[24] They took the role of executive producing, alongside their manager Mathew Knowles. Beyonc\u00e9, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance tracks and ballads\u2014which they considered songs listeners cannot sing along with. Beyonc\u00e9 further elaborated: \"We wanted to make sure that the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance.\"[1] Jerkins, who had worked with the group on their previous studio albums and with Beyonc\u00e9 for her solo debut *Dangerously in Love* (2003), was concerned with how he would manage the production, saying: \"How is this going to work?' Cause Beyonc\u00e9, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?\".[25] However, he stated his skepticism vanished once the recording commenced, as he saw the group's \"excitement being back in the studio together\", calling the process \"natural\".[25]\n\n\nThe members stated the first week of recording *Destiny Fulfilled* was spent solely on conversations about the events in their lives while being apart, as they hadn't spent quality time together for an extended period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.[25] In most cases, producers would send the group a CD containing a track which would serve as the basis in the songwriting process; without the producers' supervision of which part to sing, a new direction of their style was formed, differing from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; on some tracks from *Destiny Fulfilled*, their vocals alternated on every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists.[1] Differing from *Survivor*, on which Beyonc\u00e9 had taken an active role in writing and producing, *Destiny Fulfilled* saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences, individual opinions and points of view independent of those from the other members.[1] As Kelly Rowland was recently engaged during the songwriting process, her writing was further influenced by the engagement. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the lyrical themes as well: \"All of us have been in three different places\u00a0... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record.\"[26]\n\n\n\n## Music and lyrics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAmerican rappers T.I. (*left*) and Lil Wayne (*right*) were the only two featured artists on the album, appearing on the second track \"Soldier\".\n\nDuring an interview with MTV, Beyonc\u00e9 stated that the songs from *Destiny Fulfilled* put altogether tell a complete story and noted that each track was a subsequent continuation of its predecessor. She concluded: \"[The album continues with] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it because they love themselves and find it in themselves. It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's everything that we wanted it to be.\"[25] Musically, Destiny's Child tried challenging themselves, as they worked with different arrangements while trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by The Emotions, Jodeci and SWV mixing elements of their music.[27] Their final product was a predominantly R&B record, which further incorporated soul, dance and hip hop.[28][29] The album is mostly composed of mid-tempo tracks, following the up-tempo first two tracks;[30] Caroline Sullivan of *The Guardian* felt the balladry showcased \"the girliness in the trio, musically and lyrically\".[31] Eric Henderson of *Slant Magazine* found elements of middle of the road music in the ballads.[32]\n\n\n*Destiny Fulfilled* opens with the up-tempo dance track \"Lose My Breath\", which details a man full of empty promises to a woman.[1][30] It is musically complete with military, marching-band drums, keyboard stabs, and the backing track contains various sound effects.[33][34] \"Soldier\", featuring T.I. and Lil Wayne, contains elements of Southern hip hop and crunk.[1][35] Unsatisfied and unfulfilled with the lover from \"Lose My Breath\", the protagonists ask for a decent \"soldier\", further singing about finding a gangster.[36] After finding him, the R&B ballad \"Cater 2 U\" lyrically details submissively serving the man.[37] Inspired by him, the protagonists sing about doing various things to make him happy, musically accompanied by synthesizer as the song builds a crescendo.[1][37] The fourth track \"T-Shirt\" is complete with inorganic drum sounds, guitar and backwards loop as the trio sings about sleeping in bed with their lover's T-shirt, \"craving his presence, and inhailing his scent\".[33][37] \"Is She the Reason\" is an R&B ballad noted to have a similar chord progression to works of The Beatles. It lyrically follows a protagonist competing with another woman for her lover's love and attention.[37] The song contains a trumpet-laden sample from Melba Moore's song \"I Don't Know No One Else to Turn To\".[36]\n\n\n\"Girl\" was noted for its Motown influence and friendship-themed lyrics.[28][37] It features Beyonc\u00e9 and Williams concerned about the relationship Rowland is in, trying to comfort her and persuade her to leave her partner.[38] Rowland lyrically responds to them by ending the relationship on the following track \"Bad Habit\", on which she solely sings lead vocals.[39] \"If\", complete with strings, lyrically talks about men who don't appreciate their girlfriends until their relationship ends and they realize their mistakes.[28][37] \"Free\" was described as a \"soul classic from 1975\",[40] with critics also noting elements of 1970s funk music, as the trio speaks on being \"set free\" after being in a relationship in which their efforts were never reciprocated.[33] The mid-tempo track \"Through with Love\" was noted for its \"angry\" nature as it addresses a break-up.[33][41] It features an undulating piano line as the members sing with restrained vocals and later religious redemption with elements of gospel.[35] On the closing track \"Love\", \"capital *L* kicks the daylights out of the forces of fear, doubt and disappointment\", as the group \"thank[s] God for love\".[37] They further sing about how people \"can't truly love another until [they] love God and then [themselves]\",[28] proclaiming that they have found love and are \"madly in it\".[42]\n\n\n\n## Release and promotion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It\n\n![](image)Destiny's Child performing \"Say My Name\" during the Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It tour in May 2005\nPromotion of *Destiny Fulfilled* commenced when Destiny's Child performed \"Lose My Breath\" after its online release on September 9, 2004 on ABC's 2004 NFL season \"Opening Kickoff\" special, to break their two-year hiatus.[43][44] The album's track listing was revealed on October 15.[45] On October 25, they appeared at the Radio Music Awards in Las Vegas, performing the song with an a cappella, jazz-styled opening.[46] The following month, they performed a medley composed of \"Say My Name\", \"Independent Women Part I\" and \"Survivor\" and finished with \"Lose My Breath\" on *The Oprah Winfrey Show*, where they also sat down for an interview with Oprah Winfrey.[47] On November 8, 2004, the trio appeared on *Total Request Live* and performed \"Lose My Breath\" along with \"Say My Name\".[1][48] They additionally appeared on the German entertainment television show *Wetten, dass..?* on November 13, and performed \"Lose My Breath\".[49] Originally slated for November 16, *Destiny Fulfilled* was released a day earlier due to Columbia Records' concern over \"potential for Internet leaks and 'burned' CD counterfeits\" which could \"lead consumers to experience inferior and incomplete versions of the album\".[50] MTV had already made it available for streaming as part of its program \"The Leak\" on November 8, while Trans World Entertainment and Walmart began selling the album on November 12.[51][52] Although the album's format was originally announced to be the then-new DualDisc, it was released on an audio-only CD;[51] however, it was released on DualDisc on February 8, 2005.[53] On BET's *106 & Park*, Destiny's Child performed \"Soldier\" on November 15, 2004.[54] They also performed the song on CBS's *The Early Show* on December 8.[55] In February 2005, they gave another performance of \"Soldier\" on the British television show *Top of the Pops*.[56] At the 2005 NBA All-Star Game on February 20, they performed both \"Soldier\" and \"Lose My Breath\".[57] They performed the latter again at the 2005 ESPY Awards on July 13.[58] \"Cater 2 U\" was performed on June 28 at the 2005 BET Awards in Los Angeles.[59][60]\n\n\nWhen the advanced release date of *Destiny Fulfilled* was announced, Destiny's Child confirmed the initial dates of their world tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It, which visited Asia, Oceania, Europe and North America from April to September 2005. Promotions of the tour aired over radio stations and television channels across the United States, with the group further collaborating with McDonald's, which served as its sponsor.[45][61] Outside North America, it was promoted with a CD+DVD tour edition of the album, which included music videos and live performances.[62] The tour's set list included tracks from *Destiny Fulfilled* alongside Destiny's Child's previous work and each member's individual songs. Numerous costume changes occurred throughout the show; the concerts exhibited products from Beyonc\u00e9's clothing line from House of Der\u00e9on, the company she co-founded with her mother Tina Knowles.[63] During a concert at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona on June 11, Rowland announced before 16,000 spectators that Destiny's Child would disband following the end of the tour.[64] In a statement released to MTV, the group said the tour had provided them the opportunity to depart from Destiny's Child on a \"high note\". They also talked about the moment when the group started their musical endeavor and their realizations of pursuing individual careers after working together for several years. Destiny's Child thanked fans for their support while not closing the chance of seeing them continue supporting each member's goals in music, film and television.[64] The July 15 show in Atlanta was filmed for the video album *Live in Atlanta*, which was released on March 28, 2006.[65] A commercial success, the video debuted atop the US Top Music Videos and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[66][67]\n\n\n\n## Singles[edit]\n\n\n\"Lose My Breath\" was released as the lead single from *Destiny Fulfilled* on September 9, 2004.[43] A widespread commercial success, it peaked at number three on the US *Billboard* Hot 100, becoming the group's seventh consecutive top-ten single on the chart.[68] Furthermore, it became their second Dance Club Songs number-one single.[69] The digital single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in July 2020.[4] Internationally, the song peaked atop the European Hot 100 Singles,[70] as well as charts in Belgium, Ireland and Switzerland, further peaking within the top ten in almost every other country.[71] The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) used the song as the music for their introductory montage during the 2004 NBA Playoffs and through the first few weeks of the 2005 NBA Playoffs.[72] Critically acclaimed, it was nominated for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards (2005).[5] Its accompanying music video was directed by Marc Klasfeld and shows the group members involved in an alleyway dance battle against their own duplicates.[73] At the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for Best Dance Video.[74]\n\n\n\"Soldier\" was released as the second single from *Destiny Fulfilled* on November 9, 2004.[75] Repeating the success of its predecessor, it peaked at number three on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 and atop the Dance Club Songs.[2][69] The digital single was certified platinum by the RIAA in July 2020.[4] Internationally, the song peaked within the top ten in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.[76][77][78] Critically acclaimed, it was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards (2006).[5] The black and white accompanying music video for the song was directed by Ray Kay and features appearances from featured artists T.I. and Lil Wayne, Beyonc\u00e9's sister Solange, singers Lloyd and Ginuwine, and rappers Bow Wow, Ice Cube, WC and Jeezy.[73] At the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for Best Group Video.[74]\n\n\n\"Girl\" was released as the third single from *Destiny Fulfilled* on March 15, 2005.[79] It failed to replicate the success of its predecessors as it peaked only at number 23 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100, ending Destiny's Child's streak of top-ten singles on the chart.[2] The digital single was certified gold by the RIAA in October 2005.[4] Internationally, the song peaked within the top ten in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the UK.[76][80] Its *Sex and the City*-inspired accompanying music video was directed by Bryan Barber and follows the song's lyrical theme, with Rowland ending the video by leaving her deceitful lover.[73]\n\n\n\"Cater 2 U\" was released as the fourth and final single from *Destiny Fulfilled* on June 7, 2005.[81] A moderate commercial success, it peaked at number 14 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100.[2] The digital single was certified platinum by the RIAA in July 2020.[4] Internationally, the song failed to chart in most countries due to its digital-only release, but peaked at number seven in New Zealand.[82] Despite causing polarity among critics due to its lyrics, the song was nominated for Grammy Awards for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best R&B Song in 2006.[5] Its Jake Nava-directed accompanying music video depicts the group in various settings at the Red Rock Canyon State Park.[73]\n\n\n\"Got's My Own\", which originally appeared as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of *Destiny Fulfilled*, was released as a promotional single on May 3, 2005.[83]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nProfessional ratings| Aggregate scores |\n| --- |\n| Source | Rating |\n| Metacritic | 52/100[84] |\n| Review scores |\n| Source | Rating |\n| AllMusic | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[30] |\n| *Blender* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[85] |\n| E!

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 52 based on 17 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[84] Dimitri Ehrlich of *Vibe* complimented the production, saying that it \"showcases advanced production values\" with \"impressive\" songwriting and vocal abilities, concluding that it \"offers divine satisfaction\".[37] A writer for *Billboard* felt the album worked as \"a testament to Beyonc\u00e9's evolving multiple talents\".[29] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised Rowland's and Williams' abilities as vocalists and their contributions to the choruses, but felt that Beyonc\u00e9 \"steals every song\", further commending her for sounding \"larger than life even when she's quiet\". However, he concluded: \"as a whole, the album winds up sounding too reserved and heavy-handed, which makes it a disappointment\".[30] Andy Battaglia of *The A.V. Club* wrote in his review that \"*Destiny Fulfilled* sounds distant and detached\", further criticizing its mid-tempo balladry for sounding \"uninterrupted at best, uninspired at worst\".[88] Kelefa Sanneh of *The New York Times* commented that the album is \"a surprisingly perfunctory disc that never quite justifies its existence\".[41] Alan Ranta of *Tiny Mix Tapes* doubted Beyonc\u00e9's lyrical sincerity, saying: \"the success of this album depends once again on the complete suspension of die-hard fans' disbelief that Beyonc\u00e9 'Your Ad Here' Knowles could ever actually truly love another human being as much as she loves herself and her possessions.\"[42]\n\n\nCaroline Sullivan of *The Guardian* commented that the lead vocals on *Destiny Fulfilled* were likely to be sung by each member equally, noting that it made the album a \"democratic\" one. However, she criticized Destiny's Child for squandering \"the extent of their talents\" on the album.[31] Tom Sinclair of *Entertainment Weekly* also noticed its \"overall air of democracy at work\" and noted that the album \"often moves at a molasses-like pace, weighted down with a preponderance of exquisitely executed but ultimately dull ballads\".[40] Jenny Eliscu of *Rolling Stone* echoed Sinclair's comments, saying: \"In all but a couple of songs, the verses are divided into three sections, with Beyonce leading things off, followed by Rowland, then Williams\".[36] She noted that after a couple of upbeat songs, \"the album slumps into an endless string of overwrought R&B ballads where the only saving grace is\u00a0... these ladies can harmonize like nobody's business.\"[36] Eric Henderson of *Slant Magazine* commented that the album's ballads build into \"the same sort of standoffish sexual supply-and-demand bartering that has marred their worst tracks\".[32] Sarah Godfrey from *The Washington Post* also criticized the balladry, alongside the absence of women's empowerment-themed lyrical content present on the group's previous recordings, but noted each member's individuality and praised their vocal performances.[89]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\n### Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nAwards and nominations for *Destiny Fulfilled*\n| Year\n | Award\n |

increase of 713% compared to its early sales, ascending to number two on the *Billboard* 200.[99] The same week, it reached the summit of the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums after prematurely debuting at number 11.[100][101] The group's second number-one album on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums following *Survivor* (2001), it spent two weeks atop the chart.[100] On January 14, 2005, the album was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[102] It emerged seventh on the year-end *Billboard* 200 and third on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums for 2005.[103][104] By October 2009, the album had sold 3.1 million copies in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan.[105] In Canada, the album debuted and peaked at number three on the Canadian Albums Chart, and was certified platinum by Music Canada in June 2005.[106][107]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, *Destiny Fulfilled* debuted and peaked at number five on the UK Albums Chart on November 27, 2004;[108] it went on to spend a total of 25 weeks charting.[76] Additionally, the album debuted and peaked at number two on the UK R&B Albums Chart.[109] It was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on April 20, 2018.[110] Across Europe, the album reached the top ten in Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.[111][112][113] Furthermore, it peaked at number five on the European Top 100 Albums,[114] and was certified platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) in December 2004 for sales of one million copies across Europe.[115] In Australia, the album debuted and peaked at number 11 on the ARIA Top 100 Albums,[111] being certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) two weeks later.[116] In New

album worldwide of 2004.[123] One of the best-selling girl group albums of all time, it has sold over seven million copies worldwide.[124]\n\n\n\n## Impact and legacy[edit]\n\n\nUpon the release of *Destiny Fulfilled*, numerous critics questioned why Beyonc\u00e9 returned to Destiny's Child after achieving the most solo success among the members,[36][40] with Eric Henderson from *Slant Magazine* lambasting her for performing with the group again with the \"full intention\" of taking advantage in order to bolster her \"divette\" status to superstardom.[32] However, Beyonc\u00e9 responded by saying the motive behind the group's reunion was their friendship rather than business.[1] Writing for The Recording Academy, Dontaira Terrell retrospectively claimed *Destiny Fulfilled* \"peeled back the layers of the pop phenom girl group we once knew and re-introduced us to a trio of fully evolved, self-realized women\", further describing it as \"an ode to the life lessons of friendship, spiritual enlightenment, personal growth\u00a0and transformation. Its resonance is still widespread, and the baton of wisdom found in the albums [*sic*] lyrical content is just as relevant [in 2019] as it was 15 years ago.\"[125]\n\n\n\n![](image)Destiny's Child's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which they received in March 2006.\nIn the wake of their disbandment announcement in June 2005, Destiny's Child revealed in an interview that their disbandment had already been planned during the recording of *Destiny Fulfilled*, adding that its title was not coincidental. During the sessions, they discussed individual aspirations and realized that remaining as a group would prevent them in pursuing those interests. They further elaborated they wanted to part ways \"while they were on top \u2014 and more importantly, while they were still friends\".[25] Beyonc\u00e9 had also said \"the group felt it still had something to offer musically\" with the album, adding: \"We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as just the fact that three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.\".[126] Rowland commented: \"We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record\".[127] Beyonc\u00e9 also commented regarding the finality of their career: \"Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10 years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to \u2013 not because it's a good business move.\"[127]\n\n\nFollowing the conclusion of Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It, the group released their first greatest hits album *#1's* in October 2005, which became their second US *Billboard* 200 number-one album.[3] It included three new tracks,[128] one of which was Beyonc\u00e9's song \"Check on It\", which became her third US *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one single as a solo artist.[19] They subsequently released the live video album *Live in Atlanta* on March 28, 2006,[129] the same day they received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[130] Afterwards, the group formally disbanded. Following the disbandment, Beyonc\u00e9 recorded and released her second solo studio album *B'Day* (2006) to widespread critical and commercial success, while starring in the Academy Award-winning musical drama *Dreamgirls*.[131] After numerous postponements, Rowland released her second studio album *Ms. Kelly* in June 2007;[132] it became her first US *Billboard* 200 top-ten album.[133] During Beyonc\u00e9 and Rowland's respective promotions for their albums, Destiny's Child reunited at the BET Awards 2007 and during Beyonc\u00e9's 2007 world tour The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience.[134][135] Michelle Williams released her third studio album *Unexpected*, which showcased a drastic change in her musical style from gospel to dance-pop, in October 2008.[136] Destiny's Child would not release another album until the compilation album *Love Songs*\u2013which included *Destiny Fulfilled* tracks \"Cater 2 U\", \"T-Shirt\", \"If\" and \"Love\", alongside some of the group's other previous recordings and the newly-recorded \"Nuclear\"\u2013in January 2013.[137]\n\n\n\n## Track listing[edit]\n\n\n***Destiny Fulfilled***\u00a0\u2013 Standard edition| No. | Title | Writer(s) | Producer(s) | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | \"Lose My Breath\" | * Kelly Rowland\n* Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles\n* Michelle Williams\n* Sean Garrett\n* LaShawn Daniels\n* Rodney Jerkins\n* Fred Jerkins\n* Shawn Carter\n | * B.
