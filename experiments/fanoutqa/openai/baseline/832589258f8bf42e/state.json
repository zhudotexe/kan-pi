For the production background of the films, see Production of the *James Bond* films. For the various portrayals of the character, see Portrayal of James Bond in film.\n\n\nJames Bond is a fictional character created by British novelist Ian Fleming in 1953. A British secret agent working for MI6 under the codename 007, Bond has been portrayed on film in twenty-seven productions by actors Sean Connery, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig. Eon Productions, which now holds the adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels, made all but two films in the film series.[1][2]\n\n\nIn 1961, producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman purchased the filming rights to Fleming's novels.[3] They founded Eon Productions and, with financial backing by United Artists, produced *Dr. No*, directed by Terence Young and featuring Connery as Bond.[4] Following its release in 1962, Broccoli and Saltzman created the holding company Danjaq to ensure future productions in the *James Bond* film series.[5] The Eon series currently has twenty-five films, with the most recent, *No Time to Die*, released in September 2021. With a combined gross of $7.8\u00a0billion to date, it is the fifth-highest-grossing film series in nominal terms.[6] Adjusting for inflation, the series has earned over $19.2\u00a0billion in 2022 dollars from box-office receipts alone,[a] with non-Eon entries pushing this inflation-adjusted figure to a grand total in excess of $20\u00a0billion.\n\n\nThe films have won six Academy Awards: for Sound Effects (now Sound Editing) in *Goldfinger* (at the 37th Awards), to John Stears for Visual Effects in *Thunderball* (at the 38th Awards), to Per Hallberg and Karen Baker Landers for Sound Editing, to Adele and Paul Epworth for Original Song in *Skyfall* (at the 85th Awards), to Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for Original Song in *Spectre* (at the 88th Awards), and to Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell for Original Song in *No Time to Die* (at the 94th Awards). Several other songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song, including Paul McCartney's \"Live and Let Die\", Carly Simon's \"Nobody Does It Better\", and Sheena Easton's \"For Your Eyes Only\". In 1982, Albert R. Broccoli received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award.[7]\n\n\nWhen Broccoli and Saltzman bought the rights to existing and future Fleming titles, the deal did not include *Casino Royale*, which had been sold to producer Gregory Ratoff for a television adaptation in 1954. After Ratoff's death, the rights passed to Charles K. Feldman,[8] who subsequently produced the Bond spoof *Casino Royale* in 1967.[9] A legal case ensured that the film rights to the novel *Thunderball* were held by Kevin McClory, as he, Fleming and scriptwriter Jack Whittingham had written a film script on which the novel was based.[1] Although Eon Productions and McClory joined forces to produce *Thunderball*, McClory still retained the rights to the story and adapted *Thunderball* into 1983's non-Eon entry, *Never Say Never Again*.[10] Distribution rights to both of those films are currently held by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, which distributes Eon's regular series.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Eon films[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of Eon films\n| Title\n | Year\n | Bond actor\n | Director\n | Box office (millions)[13] | Budget (millions)[13] | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Actual $\n | Adjusted $2005\n | Actual $\n | Adjusted $2005\n |\n| *Dr. No* | 1962\n | Sean Connery | Terence Young | 59.5\n | 448.8\n | 1.1\n | 7.0\n | [13][14] |\n| *From Russia with Love* | 1963\n | Sean Connery | Terence Young | 78.9\n | 543.8\n | 2.0\n | 12.6\n | [13][14][15] |\n| *Goldfinger* | 1964\n | Sean Connery | Guy Hamilton | 124.9\n | 820.4\n | 3.0\n | 18.6\n | [13][14][16] |\n| *Thunderball* | 1965\n | Sean Connery | Terence Young | 141.2\n | 848.1\n | 6.8\n | 41.9\n | [13][14][17] |\n| *You Only Live Twice* | 1967\n | Sean Connery | Lewis Gilbert | 111.6\n | 514.2\n | 10.3\n | 59.9\n | [14][18] |\n| *On Her Majesty's Secret Service* | 1969\n | George Lazenby | Peter R.

Despite being suspended on his return, he decides to complete his mission and tracks down Zao to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Zao escapes, but the trail leads to British billionaire Gustav Graves.\n\n\nGraves unveils a mirror satellite, \"Icarus\", which is able to focus solar energy on a small area and provide year-round sunshine for crop development. Bond discovers that Moon has also undergone the gene therapy and has assumed the identity of Graves. Bond then exposes Moon's plan: to use the Icarus as a sun gun to cut a path through the Korean Demilitarized Zone with concentrated sunlight, allowing North Korean troops to invade South Korea and reunite the countries through force. Bond disables the Icarus controls, kills Moon and stops the invasion.\n\n\n\n### *Casino Royale* (2006)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Casino Royale* (2006 film)\n\nThis serves as a reboot of the series, with Bond gaining his 00 status in the pre-credits sequence. Bond tracks down and kills a bomb-maker and takes his mobile phone. Searching through the phone, Bond discovers a text message which he traces to Alex Dimitrios, and then on to terrorist financier Le Chiffre, who short-sells stock in successful companies and then engineers terrorist attacks to sink their share prices. Bond foils Le Chiffre's plan to destroy the prototype *Skyfleet* airliner, which forces Le Chiffre to set up a high-stakes poker tournament at the Casino Royale to recoup his fortune. Bond is instructed to beat Le Chiffre and is aided by a member of HM Treasury, Vesper Lynd.\n\n\nBond beats Le Chiffre at the poker table, but Lynd is kidnapped by Le Chiffre after the game, as is Bond, who is captured while pursuing them; Lynd is ransomed for the money and Bond is tortured. Le Chiffre is subsequently killed by Mr. White, a liaison between Le Chiffre and a number of his clients. Bond learns that his poker winnings were never repaid to the Treasury, which Lynd was supposed to have done, and establishes that she was a double agent. Bond pursues her and is attacked by members of White's organisation: he survives, but White takes the money and Lynd sacrifices herself to save Bond, as he later finds out from M. Bond subsequently finds and captures White.\n\n\n\n### *Quantum of Solace* (2008)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Quantum of Solace*\n\nAlong with M, Bond interrogates Mr. White regarding his organisation, Quantum.

Bond traces the organisation to Haiti and a connection to environmentalist Dominic Greene.\n\n\nBond uncovers a plot between Greene and an exiled Bolivian General, Medrano, to put Medrano in power in Bolivia while Quantum is given a monopoly to run the water supply to the country. Bond ascertains that Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to force the price up. With help from Bolivian secret agent Camille Montes, Bond attacks the hotel where Greene and Medrano are finalising their plans and leaves Greene stranded in the desert with only a tin of engine oil to drink. Bond then finds Vesper's former lover and member of Quantum, Yusef Kabira, bringing him to justice.\n\n\n\n### *Skyfall* (2012)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Skyfall*\n\nAfter an operation in Istanbul ends in disaster, Bond is missing and presumed to be dead. In the aftermath, questions are raised over M's ability to run the Secret Service, and she becomes the subject of a government review over her handling of the situation. The Service itself is attacked, prompting Bond's return to London. His presence assists MI6's investigation in uncovering a lead, and Bond is sent to Shanghai and Macau in pursuit of a mercenary named Patrice. There, he establishes a connection to Raoul Silva, a former MI6 agent who was captured and tortured by Chinese agents. Blaming M for his imprisonment, Silva sets in motion a plan to ruin her reputation before murdering her. Bond saves M and attempts to lure Silva into a trap, and while he is successful in repelling Silva's assault, M is killed. Bond returns to active duty under the command of the new M, Gareth Mallory.\n\n\n\n### *Spectre* (2015)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daniel Craig at the Berlin premiere of *Spectre* in October 2015\nMain article: *Spectre* (2015 film)\n\nFollowing her death in *Skyfall*, M sends Bond a posthumous message that leads him to thwart a terrorist attack in Mexico City. Gareth Mallory takes Bond off active duty for his illegal operation, but Bond continues his investigation off the books. The trail leads him first to Rome, where he learns of a sinister terrorist organisation known as Spectre, and later to Austria. There he finds former adversary Mr. White, who has become terminally ill after being poisoned by Spectre. White asks Bond to protect his daughter Madeleine Swann from Spectre and its leader, Franz Oberhauser, before committing suicide.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Mallory comes under pressure to have British intelligence join a global intelligence-sharing network code-named \"Nine Eyes\". With Swann's help, Bond tracks Spectre to Morocco and learns that Spectre is behind the terror attacks, creating a need for Nine Eyes. Spectre controls Nine Eyes, giving them access to the intelligence-sharing network. Oberhauser captures and tortures Bond, revealing that his father was Bond's guardian after the deaths of Bond's parents. Jealous of the attention and care that his father gave to the young James Bond, Oberhauser faked his own death while at the same time murdering his own father. Now known as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, he claims responsibility for everything Bond has suffered in his career. Bond and Swann escape and return to London where Bond joins forces with Mallory and Q to shut down Nine Eyes and apprehend Blofeld.[47][48][49]\n\n\n\n### *No Time to Die* (2021)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *No Time to Die*\n\nFive years after Blofeld's imprisonment, Bond is retired and living in Jamaica when Felix Leiter and his colleague Logan Ash enlist his help in searching for the missing MI6 scientist, Valdo Obruchev. Bond eventually accepts Leiter's request and follows his leads about the scientist's whereabouts to Cuba, where he infiltrates a Spectre gathering. Obruchev realises that it is a trap set by Blofeld to kill Bond with a deadly virus, but he is working for someone else and has re-engineered the virus to attack only the members of Spectre. When Bond brings Obruchev to Leiter, Ash betrays them and helps Obruchev escape, killing Leiter. Bond returns to MI6 and confronts M regarding the virus, known as \"Heracles,\" a nanoscale weapon that can be programmed to attack specific people based on their genetic marker. He then visits Blofeld in prison and is reacquainted with Madeleine Swann. Swann decides to leave before Blofeld arrives, while Bond has an altercation with Blofeld, who dies soon after. It is revealed that when he touched Swann, Bond was infected with Heracles nanobots that were programmed to kill Blofeld.\n\n\nBond traces Swann back to her childhood home where she is living with her five-year-old daughter, Mathilde. She tells Bond about Lyutsifer Safin, the man who controls Heracles. After Bond avenges Leiter's death by killing Ash, Safin captures Swann and Mathilde and brings them to his island, which is the Heracles factory. Bond works with MI6 to rescue Swann and Mathilde and destroy Safin's factory with a missile strike launched from a nearby Royal Navy destroyer. Before Bond kills him, Safin infects Bond with nanobots that have been programmed to attack Swann and Mathilde. Because of this, Bond decides to sacrifice himself to save them. After a tearful goodbye to Swann, who confirms that Mathilde is in fact his daughter, Bond is killed when the missiles obliterate the factory.[50][51]\n\n\n\n## Non-Eon films[edit]\n\n\nThe two Bond films from other production companies have a combined gross of over $200\u00a0million (or approximately $871 million in 2020 dollars)\n\n\n\n\n\nList of non-Eon films\n| Title\n | Year\n | Bond actor\n | Director(s)\n | Box office (millions)[13] | Budget (millions)[13] | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Actual $\n | Adjusted $2005\n | Actual $\n | Adjusted $2005\n |\n| *Casino Royale* | 1967 | David Niven | Ken HughesJohn HustonJoseph McGrathRobert ParrishVal GuestRichard Talmadge | 44.4\n | 260.0\n | 12.0\n | 70.0\n | [52][53][34] |\n| *Never Say Never Again* | 1983\n | Sean Connery | Irvin Kershner | 160.0\n | 314.0\n | 36.0\n | 71.0\n | [54][34] |\n| Total of non-Eon films\n | 204.4\n | 574.0\n | 48.0\n | 141.0\n |  |\n\n\n### *Casino Royale* (1967)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)David Niven, in *Casino Royale*\nMain article: *Casino Royale* (1967 film)\n\nBond is brought out of retirement to deal with SMERSH and is promoted to the head of MI6 on the death of M.
