They set their own academic standards and manage their own budgets. The president, however, plays an important part in university-wide planning and strategy. Each names a faculty's dean (and, since the foundation of the office in 1994, the university's provost), and grants tenure to recommended professors; however, the president is expected to make such decisions after extensive consultation with faculty members.\n\n\nHarvard presidents have traditionally influenced educational practices nationwide. Charles W. Eliot, for example, originated America's familiar system of a smorgasbord of elective courses available to each student;[2] James B. Conant worked to introduce standardized testing; Derek Bok and Neil L. Rudenstine argued for the continued importance of diversity in higher education.\n\n\nRecently, however, the job has become increasingly administrative, especially as fund-raising campaigns have taken on central importance in large institutions such as Harvard. Some have criticized this trend to the extent it has prevented the president from focusing on substantive issues in higher education.[3]\n\n\nEach president is professor in some department of the university and teaches from time to time.\n\n\nHarvard's current president is Claudine Gay, having become Harvard's 30th president on July 1, 2023.[4]\n\n\nShe succeeded Lawrence Bacow who retired on June 30, 2023.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAt Harvard's founding it was headed by a \"schoolmaster,\" Nathaniel Eaton. In 1640, when Henry Dunster was brought in, he adopted the title president. The origins of this title have been grounds for a certain amount of speculation.\n\n\nHarvard was founded for the training of Puritan clergy, and even though its mission was soon broadened, nearly all presidents through the end of the 18th century were in holy orders.\n\n\nAll presidents from Leonard Hoar through Nathan Pusey were graduates of Harvard College. Of the presidents since Pusey, Bok earned his undergraduate degree at Stanford, Rudenstine at Princeton, and Summers and Bacow at MIT, but each earned a graduate degree at Harvard. Drew Gilpin Faust was the first president since the seventeenth century with no earned Harvard degree.\n\n\nJohn Winthrop served as acting president in 1769 and again in 1773; but both times he declined an offer of the full presidency on grounds of old age.\n\n\nOther minor acting presidents have included William Brattle, Edward Wigglesworth (1780–1781), Henry Ware (1810, 1828–1829), Andrew Preston Peabody (1862, 1868–1869), and Henry Pickering Walcott. Henry Rosovsky, former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, served as acting president for three months in 1987 when Bok traveled abroad. Provost Albert Carnesale served as acting president for three months, from November 1994 to February 1995, during Rudenstine's leave of absence. After Faust's retirement in 2018, Bok served as interim president for a year, from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007, prior to Faust's appointment.\n\n\n\n## Presidents of Harvard[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Image\n | Presidents\n | Term of office\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Nathaniel Eaton | 1637–1639\n | Referred to as \"schoolmaster\" of Harvard College\n |\n| 1\n |  | Henry Dunster | 1640–1654\n |  |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Charles Chauncy | 1654–1672\n |  |\n| 3\n |  | Leonard Hoar | 1672–1675\n |  |\n| 4\n |  | Urian Oakes | 1675–1680 (acting); 1680–1681\n |  |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | John Rogers | 1682–1684\n |  |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Increase Mather | 1685–1686 (acting); 1686–1692 (rector); 1692–1701\n |  |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Samuel Willard | 1701–1707 (acting)\n |  |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | John Leverett | 1708–1724\n |  |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Benjamin Wadsworth | 1725–1737\n |  |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | Edward Holyoke | 1737–1769\n |  |\n| 10\n |  | Samuel Locke | 1770–1773\n |  |\n| 11\n |  | Samuel Langdon | 1774–1780\n |  |\n| 12\n |  | Joseph Willard | 1781–1804\n |  |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Eliphalet Pearson | 1804–1806 (acting)\n |  |\n| 13\n |  | Samuel Webber | 1806–1810\n |  |\n| 14\n | ![](image) | John Thornton Kirkland | 1810–1828\n |  |\n| 15\n | ![](image) | Josiah Quincy | 1829–1845\n |  |\n| 16\n | ![](image) | Edward Everett | 1846–1848\n |  |\n| 17\n | ![](image) | Jared Sparks | 1849–1853\n |  |\n| 18\n | ![](image) | James Walker | 1853–1860\n |  |\n| 19\n | ![](image) | Cornelius Conway Felton | 1860–1862\n |  |\n| 20\n | ![](image) | Thomas Hill | 1862–1868\n |  |\n| 21\n | ![](image) | Charles William Eliot | 1869–1909\n | Longest term of office (40 years)\n |\n| 22\n | ![](image) | A.

They set their own academic standards and manage their own budgets. The president, however, plays an important part in university-wide planning and strategy. Each names a faculty's dean (and, since the foundation of the office in 1994, the university's provost), and grants tenure to recommended professors; however, the president is expected to make such decisions after extensive consultation with faculty members.\n\n\nHarvard presidents have traditionally influenced educational practices nationwide. Charles W. Eliot, for example, originated America's familiar system of a smorgasbord of elective courses available to each student;[2] James B. Conant worked to introduce standardized testing; Derek Bok and Neil L. Rudenstine argued for the continued importance of diversity in higher education.\n\n\nRecently, however, the job has become increasingly administrative, especially as fund-raising campaigns have taken on central importance in large institutions such as Harvard. Some have criticized this trend to the extent it has prevented the president from focusing on substantive issues in higher education.[3]\n\n\nEach president is professor in some department of the university and teaches from time to time.\n\n\nHarvard's current president is Claudine Gay, having become Harvard's 30th president on July 1, 2023.[4]\n\n\nShe succeeded Lawrence Bacow who retired on June 30, 2023.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAt Harvard's founding it was headed by a \"schoolmaster,\" Nathaniel Eaton. In 1640, when Henry Dunster was brought in, he adopted the title president. The origins of this title have been grounds for a certain amount of speculation.\n\n\nHarvard was founded for the training of Puritan clergy, and even though its mission was soon broadened, nearly all presidents through the end of the 18th century were in holy orders.\n\n\nAll presidents from Leonard Hoar through Nathan Pusey were graduates of Harvard College. Of the presidents since Pusey, Bok earned his undergraduate degree at Stanford, Rudenstine at Princeton, and Summers and Bacow at MIT, but each earned a graduate degree at Harvard. Drew Gilpin Faust was the first president since the seventeenth century with no earned Harvard degree.\n\n\nJohn Winthrop served as acting president in 1769 and again in 1773; but both times he declined an offer of the full presidency on grounds of old age.\n\n\nOther minor acting presidents have included William Brattle, Edward Wigglesworth (1780–1781), Henry Ware (1810, 1828–1829), Andrew Preston Peabody (1862, 1868–1869), and Henry Pickering Walcott. Henry Rosovsky, former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, served as acting president for three months in 1987 when Bok traveled abroad. Provost Albert Carnesale served as acting president for three months, from November 1994 to February 1995, during Rudenstine's leave of absence. After Faust's retirement in 2018, Bok served as interim president for a year, from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007, prior to Faust's appointment.\n\n\n\n## Presidents of Harvard[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Image\n | Presidents\n | Term of office\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Nathaniel Eaton | 1637–1639\n | Referred to as \"schoolmaster\" of Harvard College\n |\n| 1\n |  | Henry Dunster | 1640–1654\n |  |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Charles Chauncy | 1654–1672\n |  |\n| 3\n |  | Leonard Hoar | 1672–1675\n |  |\n| 4\n |  | Urian Oakes | 1675–1680 (acting); 1680–1681\n |  |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | John Rogers | 1682–1684\n |  |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Increase Mather | 1685–1686 (acting); 1686–1692 (rector); 1692–1701\n |  |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Samuel Willard | 1701–1707 (acting)\n |  |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | John Leverett | 1708–1724\n |  |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Benjamin Wadsworth | 1725–1737\n |  |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | Edward Holyoke | 1737–1769\n |  |\n| 10\n |  | Samuel Locke | 1770–1773\n |  |\n| 11\n |  | Samuel Langdon | 1774–1780\n |  |\n| 12\n |  | Joseph Willard | 1781–1804\n |  |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Eliphalet Pearson | 1804–1806 (acting)\n |  |\n| 13\n |  | Samuel Webber | 1806–1810\n |  |\n| 14\n | ![](image) | John Thornton Kirkland | 1810–1828\n |  |\n| 15\n | ![](image) | Josiah Quincy | 1829–1845\n |  |\n| 16\n | ![](image) | Edward Everett | 1846–1848\n |  |\n| 17\n | ![](image) | Jared Sparks | 1849–1853\n |  |\n| 18\n | ![](image) | James Walker | 1853–1860\n |  |\n| 19\n | ![](image) | Cornelius Conway Felton | 1860–1862\n |  |\n| 20\n | ![](image) | Thomas Hill | 1862–1868\n |  |\n| 21\n | ![](image) | Charles William Eliot | 1869–1909\n | Longest term of office (40 years)\n |\n| 22\n | ![](image) | A.

One of its ten founding ministers, Abraham Pierson, became its first Rector, the administrative and ecclesiastical head of the college. After Pierson, four more ministers served as rectors of the collegiate school, until 1745 when Yale College was chartered by the Colony of Connecticut and Thomas Clap's title was changed to president. In 1878, Yale incorporated as a university, and incumbent Timothy Dwight V became the last president of the college and the first of Yale University. The first president not ordained as a minister was Arthur Twining Hadley, inaugurated in 1899; no ordained person has held the office since.\n\n\nThe president is elected by the Yale Corporation, the governing body of the University on which the president sits *ex-officio*. The corporation's bylaws state that the president is \"chief executive officer of the University and as such is responsible for the general direction of all its affairs.\"[1] The president nominates other university officers, including the provost, secretary, and other vice presidents, for election by the corporation. Other top-level administrative positions, such as university chaplain, deans of schools, and masters of residential colleges, are appointed by the president alone.\n\n\nThe university's current president is Peter Salovey, a professor of social psychology who formerly served as University Provost and Dean of Yale College and received his Ph.D. from Yale's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\nThe Office of the President is located in Woodbridge Hall, a 1901 building erected specifically for administrative purpose.[2] The university maintains an official home for the president on Hillhouse Avenue, which hosts presidential events. Peter Salovey, inaugurated in 2013, is the first president since 1986 to use the home as his primary residence.[3]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ezra Stiles, by Samuel King\n## Rectors of Yale College (1701–)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | Rectors of Yale College[4] | birth–death | years as rector\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Abraham Pierson | (1641–1707) | (1701–1707) Collegiate School\n |\n| 2 | Samuel Andrew | (1656–1738) | (1707–1719; *pro tempore*)\n |\n| 3 | Timothy Cutler | (1684–1765) | (1719–1726) 1718/9: renamed Yale College\n |\n| 4 | Elisha Williams | (1694–1755) | (1726–1739)\n |\n| 5 | Thomas Clap | (1703–1767) | (1740–1745)\n |\n\n\n## Presidents of Yale College (1740–1878) and Yale University (1878–)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | Presidents of Yale College[4] | birth–death | years as president\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 | Thomas Clap | (1703–1767) | (1745–1766)\n |\n| 6 | Naphtali Daggett | (1727–1780) | (1766–1777; *pro tempore*) - presidency during the American Revolution\n |\n| 7 | Ezra Stiles | (1727–1795) | (1778–1795) - presidency during the American Revolution\n |\n| 8 | Timothy Dwight IV | (1752–1817) | (1795–1817)\n |\n| 9 | Jeremiah Day | (1773–1867) | (1817–1846)\n |\n| 10 | Theodore Dwight Woolsey | (1801–1889) | (1846–1871)\n |\n| 11 | Noah Porter III | (1811–1892) | (1871–1886)\n |\n| 12 | Timothy Dwight V | (1828–1916) | (1886–1899) 1887: renamed Yale University\n |\n| 13 | Arthur Twining Hadley | (1856–1930) | (1899–1921)\n |\n| 14 | James Rowland Angell | (1869–1949) | (1921–1937)\n |\n| 15 | Charles Seymour | (1885–1963) | (1937–1951)\n |\n| 16 | Alfred Whitney Griswold | (1906–1963) | (1951–1963)\n |\n| 17 | Kingman Brewster, Jr. | (1919–1988) | (1963–1977)\n |\n| 18 | Hanna Holborn Gray | (1930– ) | (1977–1978; pro tempore)\n |\n| 19 | A.

In preparation for this expansion in mission, William Smith was hired in 1754 to become the new provost. Neither George Whitefield nor Benjamin Franklin formally held this title.\n2. **^** Benjamin Franklin is the founder of the institution which grew to become the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin first convened a board of trustees for an organizational meeting on November 13, 1749. They opened a secondary school, the Academy of Philadelphia, in 1751. A collegiate charter was obtained for the College of Philadelphia in 1755 and post-secondary instruction began shortly thereafter. It was the College of Philadelphia which ultimately was renamed the University of Pennsylvania in 1791. Penn considered 1749 to be its founding date until 1899, when the board of trustees voted to retroactively revise its founding date to 1740 in order to make the university older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746. The 1740 date was selected because, in that year, a group of Philadelphians joined together to build a large preaching hall for the use of traveling evangelist George Whitefield who toured the American colonies delivering well attended open air sermons. The grand building was erected but, due to a shortage of funding, the interior was not furnished and the hall sat unused until Franklin's group purchased it in 1750. Thus, Whitefield himself was not involved in the school which eventually became Penn, but is listed here as a placeholder to signify the period that the preaching hall raised by his followers sat dormant between 1740 and 1750.\n3. **^** As described in more detail in the appended notes, a charity school was planned by followers of George Whitefield but it never opened before the building was purchased by Benjamin Franklin's group in 1750. The structure itself was known as the \"New Building\" but the associated educational trust itself was never named.\n4. **^** Franklin's formal title was president of the board of trustees, first of the \"Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania\" until the college was founded, and then of the \"College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\"\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Schools | * Arts and Sciences\n\t+ College\n\t+ Graduate Division\n\t+ Liberal and Professional Studies\n* Communication\n* Dental Medicine\n* Design\n* Education\n* Engineering and Applied Science\n* Law\n* Medicine\n* Nursing\n* Social Policy and Practice\n* Veterinary Medicine\n* Wharton\n | ![Benjamin Franklin (University of Pennsylvania)](image)\n |\n| Programs | * Advanced Judaic Studies\n* Government\n* Global Communication Studies\n* Mediterranean Art and Archaeology\n* International Studies and Business\n* Management and Technology\n* Lauder Institute\n* Health Economics\n* Networked and Social Systems Engineering\n* Molecular Life Science\n* Public Policy\n* Diplomacy and Global Engagement\n |\n| Places | * University City\n* Annenberg Center\n* College Hall\n* College Houses\n* David Rittenhouse Laboratory\n* Fisher Fine Arts Library\n* Historic District\n* Houston Hall\n* Institute of Contemporary Art\n* Irvine Auditorium\n* Kelly Writers House\n* Meyerson Hall\n* Moore School\n* Morris Arboretum\n* Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\n* New Bolton Center\n* Penn Park\n* Perelman Quadrangle\n* The Quadrangle\n* Richards Laboratories\n* Van Pelt Library\n |\n| Athletics | * Penn Quakers\n* Band\n* \"Fight on, Pennsylvania!\"\n* Basketball\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Football\n* College Boat Club\n* Lacrosse\n* Penn Relays\n* Soccer\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Men's squash\n* Class of 1923 Arena\n* Franklin Field\n* Meiklejohn Stadium\n* Palestra\n |\n| Media | * *The Daily Pennsylvanian*\n\t+ *34th Street Magazine*\n\t+ *Under the Button*\n* *Pennsylvania Punch Bowl*\n* Penn Press\n* Wharton School Publishing\n* WQHS\n* WXPN\n |\n| Life | * Student life\n* Penn Band\n* Mask and Wig\n* Glee Club\n* Masala\n* MERT\n* Philomathean Society\n* Penn Club of New York\n* \"Hail, Pennsylvania!\"\n* \"The Red and Blue\"\n |\n| People | * **President:** J.

Built in 1756, the John Maclean House, also known as the President's House, was where the president lived until Prospect House was acquired in 1878.[16] In 1968, the official residence switched again to Walter Lowrie House.[17] The Office of the President is housed in Nassau Hall.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of presidents\n| No. | President\n | Presidency\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![Portrait of Jonathan Dickinson](image) | Jonathan Dickinson | 1747\n | Died shortly after entering office from a pleuritic illness[19] | [6] |\n| 2\n | ![Portrait of Aaron Burr, Sr.](image) | Aaron Burr Sr. | 1748–1757[b] | Minister of the Presbyterian Church of Newark.[21] Father of Aaron Burr, the third Vice President of the United States.[22] Died from illness while in office.[23] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | David Cowell | 1757-1758\n | Served as acting president.[11] | [11] |\n| 3\n | ![Portrait of Jonathan Edwards](image) | Jonathan Edwards | 1758\n | Eminent theologian to the First Great Awakening.[24][25] Died five weeks into office after a fever from a smallpox vaccine.[26] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | Jacob Green | 1758–1759\n | Delegate for Morris County to the Provincial Congress of New Jersey.[27] Father of Ashbel Green, 8th president of the university.[28][27] Served as acting president.[6] | [6] |\n| 4\n | ![Portrait of Samuel Davies](image) | Samuel Davies | 1759–1761\n | Died shortly after entering office from pneumonia[29] | [6] |\n| 5\n | ![Portrait of Samuel Finley](image) | Samuel Finley | 1761–1766\n | Founder of West Nottingham Academy;[30][31] Minister of the Cold Spring Presbyterian Church.[32] Graduate of the Log College.[33] Died while in office in Philadelphia seeking medical treatment.[34] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | John Blair | 1767–1768\n | Graduate of the Log College.[33] Served as acting president.[6] | [6] |\n| 6\n | ![Portrait of John Witherspoon](image) | John Witherspoon | 1768–1794\n | Signer of the Declaration of Independence; Delegate to the Second Continental Congress; Moderator of the first General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.[35] Died while in office.[36] | [6] |\n| 7\n | ![Portrait of Samuel S.

Built in 1756, the John Maclean House, also known as the President's House, was where the president lived until Prospect House was acquired in 1878.[16] In 1968, the official residence switched again to Walter Lowrie House.[17] The Office of the President is housed in Nassau Hall.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of presidents\n| No. | President\n | Presidency\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![Portrait of Jonathan Dickinson](image) | Jonathan Dickinson | 1747\n | Died shortly after entering office from a pleuritic illness[19] | [6] |\n| 2\n | ![Portrait of Aaron Burr, Sr.](image) | Aaron Burr Sr. | 1748–1757[b] | Minister of the Presbyterian Church of Newark.[21] Father of Aaron Burr, the third Vice President of the United States.[22] Died from illness while in office.[23] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | David Cowell | 1757-1758\n | Served as acting president.[11] | [11] |\n| 3\n | ![Portrait of Jonathan Edwards](image) | Jonathan Edwards | 1758\n | Eminent theologian to the First Great Awakening.[24][25] Died five weeks into office after a fever from a smallpox vaccine.[26] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | Jacob Green | 1758–1759\n | Delegate for Morris County to the Provincial Congress of New Jersey.[27] Father of Ashbel Green, 8th president of the university.[28][27] Served as acting president.[6] | [6] |\n| 4\n | ![Portrait of Samuel Davies](image) | Samuel Davies | 1759–1761\n | Died shortly after entering office from pneumonia[29] | [6] |\n| 5\n | ![Portrait of Samuel Finley](image) | Samuel Finley | 1761–1766\n | Founder of West Nottingham Academy;[30][31] Minister of the Cold Spring Presbyterian Church.[32] Graduate of the Log College.[33] Died while in office in Philadelphia seeking medical treatment.[34] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | John Blair | 1767–1768\n | Graduate of the Log College.[33] Served as acting president.[6] | [6] |\n| 6\n | ![Portrait of John Witherspoon](image) | John Witherspoon | 1768–1794\n | Signer of the Declaration of Independence; Delegate to the Second Continental Congress; Moderator of the first General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.[35] Died while in office.[36] | [6] |\n| 7\n | ![Portrait of Samuel S.

When it was resuscitated by the New York State Legislature, the university was placed directly under the control of the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York; its chancellor, George Clinton, served as the *de facto* president of Columbia University.[1] Through the efforts of Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, control of the university was returned to a private board of trustees in 1787, which has to this day maintained the right to appoint or remove the president, who also serves on the board *ex officio*.[1] The university's first president was Samuel Johnson, who held the office from 1754 to 1763, and its 20th and current president is Minouche Shafik, whose tenure began on July 1, 2023.\n\n\nUpon the founding of the university, it was stipulated by the vestrymen of Trinity Church, on whose land King's College sat, that every president must be a member of the Church of England; otherwise, the land would revert back to the church.[2] As such, every single president of the university until the appointment of Dwight D. Eisenhower was Anglican, while the first six presidents, with the exception of William Samuel Johnson, were all either Anglican priests or bishops.[3] Michael I. Sovern, appointed in 1980, was the university's first Jewish president.[4] In 2023, Minouche Shafik became the woman to serve as president of the university.[5]\n\n\nFrom 1902 to 1970, every president was involved in foreign relations in some capacity: Nicholas Murray Butler was the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace from 1925 to 1945, and was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his promotion of the Kellogg–Briand Pact; Dwight D. Eisenhower served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force during World War II, and after his tenure would serve as President of the United States; and Grayson L. Kirk and Andrew W. Cordier were both instrumental to the formation of the United Nations.\n\n\nAs established by Columbia University's governing statutes, it is the duty of the president to exercise jurisdiction over all affairs of the university; to call special meetings of the University Senate, faculties, and administration; to report to the Trustees of Columbia on the state and needs of the university annually; and to administer discipline. The consent of the president is necessary for any act made by a faculty or administrative board, unless their veto is overridden by two-thirds vote. Additionally, the president is able to grant leaves of absences, give faculty permission to use university laboratories for experiments, and confer academic and honorary degrees on behalf of the board of trustees.[1]\n\n\nThe president is *ex officio* a permanent member of the Pulitzer Prize Board, and has annually presented the awards to its recipients since 1984.[6] In addition, the president is an *ex officio* member of the board of trustees of Barnard College.[7]\n\n\n\n## List of presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| # | Image | President | Birth year–Death year | Years as president | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) | Samuel Johnson[8] | 1696–1772 | 1754–1763 |  |\n| 2 | ![](image) | Myles Cooper[8] | 1735–1785 | 1763–1775 |  |\n| – | ![](image) | Benjamin Moore, B.A. 1768[8] | 1748–1816 | 1775–1776 | acting\n |\n| – | ![](image) | George Clinton[9] | 1739–1812 | 1784–1787 | as chancellor of the University of the State of New York; 1st governor of New York and later 4th vice president of the United States |\n| 3 | ![](image) | William Samuel Johnson[8] | 1727–1819 | 1787–1800 | signed the Constitution of the United States; served as United States Senator from Connecticut |\n| 4 | ![](image) | Charles Henry Wharton[8] | 1748–1833 | 1801–1801 |  |\n| 5 | ![](image) | Benjamin Moore, B.A. 1768[8] | 1748–1816 | 1801–1810 |  |\n| 6 | ![](image) | William Harris[8] | 1765–1829 | 1811–1829 | shared authority with Provost John Mitchell Mason until 1816\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) | William Alexander Duer[8] | 1780–1858 | 1829–1842 |  |\n| 8 | ![](image) | Nathaniel Fish Moore, B.A. 1802[8] | 1782–1872 | 1842–1849 |  |\n| 9 | ![](image) | Charles King[8] | 1789–1867 | 1849–1863 | presided over move to Madison Avenue campus\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) | Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard[8] | 1809–1889 | 1864–1888 |  |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Henry Drisler, B.A. 1839[10] | 1818–1897\n | 1867, 1888–1889\n | acting\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) | Seth Low, B.A. 1870[8] | 1850–1916 | 1890–1901 | presided over move to Morningside Heights campus; 23rd mayor of Brooklyn and 92nd mayor of New York City |\n| –\n | ![](image) | John Howard Van Amringe, B.A. 1860, M.A. 1863[11] | 1836–1915\n | 1899\n | acting\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) | Nicholas Murray Butler, B.A. 1882, M.A. 1883, Ph.D. 1884[8] | 1862–1947 | 1902–1945 | Nobel Peace Prize laureate\n |\n| – | ![](image) | Frank D.

During his tenure, Brown saw fundraising success, with the University's endowment surpassing $1 billion.[17] Applications increased, undergraduate scholarships doubled, and the University's reputation grew.[18][19] |\n| 17\n | ![](image) | Gordon Gee | – | 1944– | 1998–2000 | Plans were announced for a large biomedical sciences building requiring the sale of $80 million in bonds; funds were cut for a popular string quartet drawing criticism that Gee's vision is at odds with the University's liberal arts-oriented identity.[20] Gee resigned abruptly after only two years in a move criticized by University leaders.[21] |\n| 18\n | ![](image) | Ruth Simmons | – | 1945– | 2001–2012 | At the time of her appointment Simmons became Brown's first woman president and the first African-American president of an Ivy League university.[22] In 2001, *Time* named Simmons America's best college president. The Sidney E. Frank Hall for Life Sciences (2006) and Granoff Center for the Creative Arts both opened (2011).\nFollowing a $100 million gift, the Medical School was renamed the *Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University* (2007).[23] The University opened a new medical campus in the Jewelry District (2011).[24]\n |\n| 19\n | ![](image) | Christina Paxson | – | 1960– | 2012– | Christina Paxson is Brown's current president. During her tenure, Brown has established its School of Public Health, expanded the physical footprint of the School of Engineering, and completed a historically large fundraising campaign.[25][26] The university has also undertaken a significant expansion of residential facilities, constructing its first new dormitories in 35 years.[27][28] |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Encyclopedia Brunoniana | Revolutionary War\". *www.brown.edu*.

In its early days, it housed the school's students and classrooms. Today, it is home to the university's administration.\nThe **President of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey** (informally called **Rutgers University**) /ˈrʌtɡərz/ is the chief administrator of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. Rutgers was founded by clergymen affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church in 1766 as *Queen's College* and was the eighth-oldest of nine colleges established during the American colonial period. Before 1956, Rutgers was a small liberal arts college and became a full university in 1924 with the offering of graduate degree programs and the establishment of professional schools. Today, Rutgers is a public research university with three campuses in the state located in New Brunswick and Piscataway, Newark, and Camden. The state's flagship university with approximately 65,000 students and employing 20,000 faculty and staff members, Rutgers is the largest institution for higher education in New Jersey.\n\n\nSince 1785, twenty one men have served as the institution's president, beginning with the Reverend Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh, a Dutch Reformed clergyman who was responsible for establishing the college.[1][2] Before 1930, most of the university's presidents were clergymen affiliated with Christian denominations in the Reformed tradition (either Dutch or German Reformed, or Presbyterian).[2][3] Two presidents were alumni of Rutgers College—the Rev. William H. S. Demarest (Class of 1883) and Philip Milledoler Brett (Class of 1892).[4][5] The current president Dr. Jonathan Holloway, who became the university's twenty-first president on July 1, 2020. Dr. Holloway, who is African American, is the first person of color to lead Rutgers University.[6][7]\n\n\nThe president serves in an *ex officio* capacity as a presiding officer within the University's 59-member board of trustees and its eleven-member board of governors,[8] and is appointed by these boards to oversee day-to-day operations of the University across its three campuses. He is charged with implementing \"board policies with the help and advice of senior administrators and other members of the university community.\"[9] The president is responsible only to those two governing boards—there is no oversight by state officials. Frequently, the president also occupies a professorship in his academic discipline and engages in instructing students.\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents of Rutgers University[edit]\n\n\nThe following twenty individuals have served as president of Rutgers University from the creation of the office in 1785 to the present. Those marked with their names **in bold** had graduated from Rutgers. Those marked with \"↑\" died in office. Where years don't overlap there was a gap of a few months while a suitable candidate was found, this usually occurred when someone died in office, or left unexpectedly to accept another position.\n\n\n\n### Presidents of Queen's College (1785–1825)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A stained-glass window in Kirkpatrick Chapel, given by the Frelinghuysen family, depicts the signing of the Queen's College charter in 1766.\nRutgers was founded as *Queen's College* on November 10, 1766, and is the eighth-oldest college in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution.[10][11] The university is one of only two colonial colleges that later became public universities.[a]\n\n\nIn the early days of Queen's College, the trustees wrote to the church's leadership in Amsterdam and at the University of Utrecht to seek candidates for the position of president.[10] In their correspondence, they expressed a wish that a prospective college president possess the following characteristics:[10]\n\n\n\n* (1) he was to fill the office of professor of theology,\n* (2) to oversee the instruction in languages through tutors until professors could be secured,\n* (3) to do more or less the work of a minister on the Lord’s Day,\n* (4) to be a man of tried piety,\n* (5) to be attached to the Constitution of the Netherlands Church,\n* (6) to be a man of thorough learning,\n* (7) to be good natured,\n* (8) to be free and friendly in conversation,\n* (9) to be master of the English language, and\n* (10) to be pleased to lecture on *Marckii Medulla Theologiae Christianae*.[b]\n\n\nIts early history, Rutgers was closely allied with the Dutch Reformed Synod of New York which oversaw financial transactions and early selections of professors for Queen's College and the New Brunswick Theological Seminary.[13] The Rev. John Henry Livingston (1746–1825), who served as the college's fourth president and was responsible for establishing the New Brunswick Theological Seminary, was instrumental in raising funds to support the school after several years of being closed resulting from economic difficulties. Just before his death, Livingston raised enough donations and support to place the school on more stable financial footing, including arranging for a generous donation in 1825 from Colonel Henry Rutgers (1745–1830), a wealthy landowner and former Revolutionary War officer from New York City. The trustees of the school renamed the school in honour of Colonel Rutgers in that year.\n\n\n\n\n\n| #\n | Portrait\n | College President\n | Years in office\n | Education[2][3] | Career[2][3] | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) | Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh(1735–1790) | 1786–1790↑ | * Religious instruction at home of John Frelinghuysen\n | * Ordained as a Dutch Reformed minister\n* Served as delegate to the New Jersey Provincial Congress (1776) which framed the state's first Constitution (1776), and subsequently several terms in the state's General Assembly.\n | [2][3] |\n| 2 | ![](image) | William Linn(1752–1808) | 1791–1795(*pro tempore*) | * A.B., College of New Jersey[c] (Princeton), 1772\n | * Ordained as a Presbyterian minister, served as chaplain in Continental Army during American Revolution, later preached in Pennsylvania churches\n* Became a trustee of Queen's College in 1787.\n* Served as president during a time of financial trouble.\n* From 1789 to 1790, first Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives\n* Regent of the University of the State of New York (1787–1808)\n | [2][3] |\n| 3 | ![](image) | Ira Condict(1764–1811) | 1795–1810(*pro tempore*) | * A.B., College of New Jersey[c] (Princeton), 1784\n | * Ordained as Presbyterian minister by John Witherspoon, first served congregations at Newton, Upper Hardwick, and Shappenock in Sussex County, New Jersey (1787–1793).\n* Installed as pastor of First Reformed Church in New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1794, and appointed Professor of Moral Philosophy at Queen's College in 1795.\n* Appointed president while college was closed 1795 to 1807, Condict provided theological instruction and oversaw the Queen's College Grammar School (now Rutgers Preparatory School)\n* After difficult fundraising effort, Queen's College reopened in 1807, cornerstone for Old Queen's building on April 27, 1809.\n | [2][3][14][15][16] |\n| 4 | ![](image) | John Henry Livingston(1746–1825) | 1810–1825↑ | * A.B., Yale College, 1762\n* Th.D., University of Utrecht, 1770\n | * Ordained as Dutch Reformed minister (1770) by Classis of Amsterdam, appointed Professor of Theology by Synod of New York\n* Began instructing candidates for ministry at home (1784), while serving a Manhattan congregation\n* Instruction seen as start of New Brunswick Theological Seminary, moved it to New Brunswick (1810) at Rev.

In its early days, it housed the school's students and classrooms. Today, it is home to the university's administration.\nThe **President of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey** (informally called **Rutgers University**) /ˈrʌtɡərz/ is the chief administrator of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. Rutgers was founded by clergymen affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church in 1766 as *Queen's College* and was the eighth-oldest of nine colleges established during the American colonial period. Before 1956, Rutgers was a small liberal arts college and became a full university in 1924 with the offering of graduate degree programs and the establishment of professional schools. Today, Rutgers is a public research university with three campuses in the state located in New Brunswick and Piscataway, Newark, and Camden. The state's flagship university with approximately 65,000 students and employing 20,000 faculty and staff members, Rutgers is the largest institution for higher education in New Jersey.\n\n\nSince 1785, twenty one men have served as the institution's president, beginning with the Reverend Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh, a Dutch Reformed clergyman who was responsible for establishing the college.[1][2] Before 1930, most of the university's presidents were clergymen affiliated with Christian denominations in the Reformed tradition (either Dutch or German Reformed, or Presbyterian).[2][3] Two presidents were alumni of Rutgers College—the Rev. William H. S. Demarest (Class of 1883) and Philip Milledoler Brett (Class of 1892).[4][5] The current president Dr. Jonathan Holloway, who became the university's twenty-first president on July 1, 2020. Dr. Holloway, who is African American, is the first person of color to lead Rutgers University.[6][7]\n\n\nThe president serves in an *ex officio* capacity as a presiding officer within the University's 59-member board of trustees and its eleven-member board of governors,[8] and is appointed by these boards to oversee day-to-day operations of the University across its three campuses. He is charged with implementing \"board policies with the help and advice of senior administrators and other members of the university community.\"[9] The president is responsible only to those two governing boards—there is no oversight by state officials. Frequently, the president also occupies a professorship in his academic discipline and engages in instructing students.\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents of Rutgers University[edit]\n\n\nThe following twenty individuals have served as president of Rutgers University from the creation of the office in 1785 to the present. Those marked with their names **in bold** had graduated from Rutgers. Those marked with \"↑\" died in office. Where years don't overlap there was a gap of a few months while a suitable candidate was found, this usually occurred when someone died in office, or left unexpectedly to accept another position.\n\n\n\n### Presidents of Queen's College (1785–1825)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A stained-glass window in Kirkpatrick Chapel, given by the Frelinghuysen family, depicts the signing of the Queen's College charter in 1766.\nRutgers was founded as *Queen's College* on November 10, 1766, and is the eighth-oldest college in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution.[10][11] The university is one of only two colonial colleges that later became public universities.[a]\n\n\nIn the early days of Queen's College, the trustees wrote to the church's leadership in Amsterdam and at the University of Utrecht to seek candidates for the position of president.[10] In their correspondence, they expressed a wish that a prospective college president possess the following characteristics:[10]\n\n\n\n* (1) he was to fill the office of professor of theology,\n* (2) to oversee the instruction in languages through tutors until professors could be secured,\n* (3) to do more or less the work of a minister on the Lord’s Day,\n* (4) to be a man of tried piety,\n* (5) to be attached to the Constitution of the Netherlands Church,\n* (6) to be a man of thorough learning,\n* (7) to be good natured,\n* (8) to be free and friendly in conversation,\n* (9) to be master of the English language, and\n* (10) to be pleased to lecture on *Marckii Medulla Theologiae Christianae*.[b]\n\n\nIts early history, Rutgers was closely allied with the Dutch Reformed Synod of New York which oversaw financial transactions and early selections of professors for Queen's College and the New Brunswick Theological Seminary.[13] The Rev. John Henry Livingston (1746–1825), who served as the college's fourth president and was responsible for establishing the New Brunswick Theological Seminary, was instrumental in raising funds to support the school after several years of being closed resulting from economic difficulties. Just before his death, Livingston raised enough donations and support to place the school on more stable financial footing, including arranging for a generous donation in 1825 from Colonel Henry Rutgers (1745–1830), a wealthy landowner and former Revolutionary War officer from New York City. The trustees of the school renamed the school in honour of Colonel Rutgers in that year.\n\n\n\n\n\n| #\n | Portrait\n | College President\n | Years in office\n | Education[2][3] | Career[2][3] | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) | Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh(1735–1790) | 1786–1790↑ | * Religious instruction at home of John Frelinghuysen\n | * Ordained as a Dutch Reformed minister\n* Served as delegate to the New Jersey Provincial Congress (1776) which framed the state's first Constitution (1776), and subsequently several terms in the state's General Assembly.\n | [2][3] |\n| 2 | ![](image) | William Linn(1752–1808) | 1791–1795(*pro tempore*) | * A.B., College of New Jersey[c] (Princeton), 1772\n | * Ordained as a Presbyterian minister, served as chaplain in Continental Army during American Revolution, later preached in Pennsylvania churches\n* Became a trustee of Queen's College in 1787.\n* Served as president during a time of financial trouble.\n* From 1789 to 1790, first Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives\n* Regent of the University of the State of New York (1787–1808)\n | [2][3] |\n| 3 | ![](image) | Ira Condict(1764–1811) | 1795–1810(*pro tempore*) | * A.B., College of New Jersey[c] (Princeton), 1784\n | * Ordained as Presbyterian minister by John Witherspoon, first served congregations at Newton, Upper Hardwick, and Shappenock in Sussex County, New Jersey (1787–1793).\n* Installed as pastor of First Reformed Church in New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1794, and appointed Professor of Moral Philosophy at Queen's College in 1795.\n* Appointed president while college was closed 1795 to 1807, Condict provided theological instruction and oversaw the Queen's College Grammar School (now Rutgers Preparatory School)\n* After difficult fundraising effort, Queen's College reopened in 1807, cornerstone for Old Queen's building on April 27, 1809.\n | [2][3][14][15][16] |\n| 4 | ![](image) | John Henry Livingston(1746–1825) | 1810–1825↑ | * A.B., Yale College, 1762\n* Th.D., University of Utrecht, 1770\n | * Ordained as Dutch Reformed minister (1770) by Classis of Amsterdam, appointed Professor of Theology by Synod of New York\n* Began instructing candidates for ministry at home (1784), while serving a Manhattan congregation\n* Instruction seen as start of New Brunswick Theological Seminary, moved it to New Brunswick (1810) at Rev.
