Some of these characteristics have been raised as an issue since the court was established in 1789. For its first 180 years, justices were almost always white male Protestants of Anglo or Northwestern European descent.[1]\n\n\nPrior to the 20th century, a few Catholics were appointed, but concerns about diversity on the court were mainly in terms of geographic diversity, to represent all geographic regions of the country, as opposed to ethnic, religious, or gender diversity.[2] The 20th century saw the first appointment of justices who were Jewish (Louis Brandeis, 1916), African-American (Thurgood Marshall, 1967), female (Sandra Day O'Connor, 1981), and Italian-American (Antonin Scalia, 1986). The first appointment of a Hispanic justice was in the 21st century with Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, with the possible exception of Justice Benjamin Cardozo, a Sephardi Jew of Portuguese descent, who was appointed in 1932.\n\n\nIn spite of the interest in the court's demographics and the symbolism accompanying the inevitably political appointment process,[3] and the views of some commentators that no demographic considerations should arise in the selection process,[4][5] the gender, race, educational background or religious views of the justices has played little documented role in their jurisprudence. For example, the opinions of the first two African-American justices reflected radically different judicial philosophies; William Brennan and Antonin Scalia shared Catholic faith and a Harvard Law School education, but shared little in the way of jurisprudential philosophies. The court's first two female justices voted together no more often than with their male colleagues, and historian Thomas R. Marshall writes that no particular \"female perspective\" can be discerned from their opinions.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Geographic background[edit]\n\n\nFor most of the existence of the court, geographic diversity was a key concern of presidents in choosing justices to appoint.[2] This was prompted in part by the early practice of Supreme Court justices also \"riding circuit\"—individually hearing cases in different regions of the country. In 1789, the United States was divided into judicial circuits, and from that time until 1891, Supreme Court justices also acted as judges within those individual circuits.[7] George Washington was careful to make appointments \"with no two justices serving at the same time hailing from the same state\".[8] Abraham Lincoln broke with this tradition during the Civil War,[7] and \"by the late 1880s presidents disregarded it with increasing frequency\".[9]\n\n\nAlthough the importance of regionalism declined, it still arose from time to time. For example, in appointing Benjamin Cardozo in 1929, President Hoover was as concerned about the controversy over having three New York justices on the court as he was about having two Jewish justices.[10] David M. O'Brien notes that \"from the appointment of John Rutledge from South Carolina in 1789 until the retirement of Hugo Black [from Alabama] in 1971, with the exception of the Reconstruction decade of 1866–1876, there was always a southerner on the bench. Until 1867, the sixth seat was reserved as the \"southern seat\". Until Cardozo's appointment in 1932, the third seat was reserved for New Englanders.\"[11] The westward expansion of the U.S. led to concerns that the western states should be represented on the court as well, which purportedly prompted William Howard Taft to make his 1910 appointment of Willis Van Devanter of Wyoming.[12]\n\n\nGeographic balance was sought in the 1970s, when Nixon attempted to employ a \"Southern strategy\", hoping to secure support from Southern states by nominating judges from the region.[1] Nixon unsuccessfully nominated Southerners Clement Haynsworth of South Carolina and G. Harrold Carswell of Florida, before finally succeeding with the nomination of Harry Blackmun of Minnesota.[13] The issue of regional diversity was again raised with the 2010 retirement of John Paul Stevens, who had been appointed from the midwestern Seventh Circuit, leaving the court with all but one Justice having been appointed from states on the East Coast.[14]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the court has a majority from the Northeastern United States, with five justices coming from states to the north and east of Washington, D.C.: two justices born in New York (two in New York City), one in New Jersey, and two from Washington, D.C., itself. The remaining four justices come from Georgia, California, Colorado, and Indiana; until the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana in 2020, the most recent justice from the Midwest had been John Paul Stevens of Illinois who retired in 2010. Contemporary justices may be associated with multiple states. Many nominees are appointed while serving in states or districts other than their hometown or home state. Chief Justice John Roberts, for example, was born in Buffalo, New York, but moved to Indiana at the age of ten, where he grew up. After law school, Roberts worked in Washington, D.C., while living in Maryland. Thus, three states may claim to be his home state. Justice Barrett is another example; although her commission identifies her as being from Indiana, she was born in New Orleans, raised in the adjacent suburb of Metairie, Louisiana, and did not live in Indiana until law school.\n\n\nSome states have been over-represented, partly because there were fewer states from which early justices could be appointed. New York has produced fifteen justices, three of whom have served as chief justice. Ohio has produced ten justices, including two chief justices; Massachusetts nine (including Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan); and Virginia eight, including three chief justices. There have been six justices each from Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Maryland (the latter including current chief justice John Roberts and current associate justice Brett Kavanaugh); and five each from Kentucky and New Jersey.[13] States that have produced four justices include California, Illinois (one chief and three associates each), and Georgia.\n\n\n\n![](image)David J. Brewer was born to missionary parents in Smyrna, in the Ottoman Empire, (now İzmir, Turkey).\n### Other states from which justices have been appointed[edit]\n\n\n* Three justices have been appointed from Connecticut (2 chiefs and 1 associate).\n* Three justices have been appointed from South Carolina (1 chief, 1 chief who was earlier an associate, and 1 associate).\n* Three associate justices have been appointed from Alabama.\n* Two associate justices have been appointed from Colorado, including current associate justice Neil Gorsuch.\n* Two associate justices have been appointed from Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, and New Hampshire.\n* One associate justice has been appointed from Arizona, while another associate justice who later became chief was born there had moved to Virginia prior to their appointment.\n* One justice, who served both as an associate and as chief, has been appointed from Louisiana; current associate justice Amy Coney Barrett was born there but had moved to Indiana prior to her appointment.\n* One associate justice has been appointed from Kansas, Maine, Missouri, Mississippi, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming.\n\n\n### States from which no justices have been appointed[edit]\n\n\nDespite the efforts to achieve geographic balance, only seven justices[a] have ever hailed from states admitted after or during the Civil War. Nineteen states have never produced a Supreme Court justice. In order of admission to the Union these are:\n\n\n\n1. Delaware (original state)\n2. Rhode Island (original state)\n3. Vermont (admitted in 1791)\n4. Arkansas (admitted in 1836)[b]\n5. Florida (admitted in 1845)[c]\n6. Wisconsin (admitted in 1848)\n7. Oregon (admitted in 1859)[d]\n8. West Virginia (admitted in 1863)[e]\n9. Nevada (admitted in 1864)\n10. Nebraska (admitted in 1867)\n11. North Dakota (admitted in 1889)\n12. South Dakota (admitted in 1889)\n13.

Hawaii (admitted in 1959)\n\n### Foreign birth[edit]\n\n\nSix justices were born outside the United States. These included James Wilson (1789–1798), born in Ceres, Fife, Scotland; James Iredell (1790–1799), born in Lewes, England; and William Paterson (1793–1806), born in County Antrim, then in the Kingdom of Ireland. Justice David J. Brewer (1889–1910) was born farthest from the U.S., in Smyrna, in the Ottoman Empire, (now İzmir, Turkey), where his parents were missionaries at the time.[16] George Sutherland (1922–1939) was born in Buckinghamshire, England. The last foreign-born justice, and the only one of these for whom English was a second language, was Felix Frankfurter (1939–1962), born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now in Austria).[17][18] The Constitution imposes no citizenship requirement on federal judges.\n\n\n\n## Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nAll Supreme Court justices were white and of mostly Northwestern European heritage until the appointment of Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Justice, in 1967. Since then, only three other non-white justices have been appointed: Marshall's African-American successor, Clarence Thomas, in 1991, Latina Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, and African-American Ketanji Brown Jackson in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-white justice\n| Name\n | Appointedfrom\n | Birth\n | Death\n | Yearappointed\n | Leftoffice\n | Appointed by\n | Reason fordeparture\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Thurgood Marshall | Maryland | 1908 | 1993 | 1967 | 1991 | Johnson | retirement\n |\n| Clarence Thomas | Georgia | 1948 | *living* | 1991 | *incumbent* | G.

There have been several justices of Irish or Ulster Scots descent, with William Paterson born in Ireland to an Ulster Scots Protestant family and Joseph McKenna, Edward Douglas White, Pierce Butler, Frank Murphy, William J. Brennan Jr., Anthony Kennedy, and Brett Kavanaugh being of Irish Catholic origin. There have been five justices of French ancestry in John Jay, Gabriel Duval, Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar, Joseph Rucker Lamar[19] and Amy Coney Barrett, with all except the Catholic Barrett being Protestants of Huguenot origins. Many justices – including John Jay, William Johnson, and Willis Van Devanter – have been of Dutch Protestant origin,[19] while two Protestant Scandinavian Americans to serve on the court have been Chief Justices Earl Warren[19] and William Rehnquist.\n\n\nUp until the 1980s, only eight justices of \"central, eastern, or southern European derivation\" had been appointed, and even among these justices, five of them \"were of Germanic background, which includes Austrian, German-Bohemian, and Swiss origins (John Catron, Samuel F. Miller, Louis Brandeis, Felix Frankfurter, and Warren Burger)\", with Brandeis and Frankfurter being of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, while only one justice was of non-Germanic, Southern European descent (Benjamin N. Cardozo, of Sephardic Jewish descent).[20] Cardozo, appointed to the court in 1932, was the first justice known to have non-Germanic, non-Anglo-Saxon or non-Irish ancestry and the first justice of Southern European descent.[*citation needed*] Both of Justice Cardozo's parents descended from Sephardic Jews from the Iberian Peninsula who fled to Holland during the Spanish Inquisition, then to London, before arriving in New York prior to the American Revolution.[21][*page needed*] At least two, Abe Fortas and Arthur Goldberg, were of Eastern European Ashkenazi descent.\n\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia, who served from 1986 to 2016, and Justice Samuel Alito, who has served since 2006, are the first justices of Italian descent to be appointed to the Supreme Court. Justice Scalia's father and both maternal grandparents as well as both of Justice Alito's parents were born in Italy.[22][23][24] Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was born to a Jewish father who immigrated from Russia at age 13 and a Jewish mother who was born four months after her parents immigrated from Poland.[25]\n\n\nAmong white ethnicities, according to 1959 and 1979 articles by Schmidhauser, there had never been a Justice with any Slavic ancestry.[19][20]\n\n\n\n### African-American justices[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of African-American jurists\n\n![](image)Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Justice, speaking with his appointing President, Lyndon B. Johnson\nNo African-American candidate was given serious consideration for appointment to the Supreme Court until the election of John F. Kennedy, who weighed the possibility of appointing William H. Hastie of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.[26] Hastie had been the first African-American elevated to a Court of Appeals when Harry S. Truman had so appointed him in 1949, and by the time of the Kennedy Administration, it was widely anticipated that Hastie might be appointed to the Supreme Court.[27] Kennedy gave serious consideration to this appointment, ensuring that this \"represented the first time in American history that an African American was an actual contender for the high court\".[26]\n\n\nThe first African-American appointed to the court was Thurgood Marshall, appointed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967. Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was \"the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place.\" Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 31, 1967.[28] Johnson confidently predicted to one biographer, Doris Kearns Goodwin, that a lot of black baby boys would be named \"Thurgood\" in honor of this choice (in fact, Kearns's research of birth records in New York and Boston indicates that Johnson's prophecy did not come true).[g]\n\n\nThe second was Clarence Thomas, appointed by George H. W. Bush to succeed Marshall in 1991. Bush initially wanted to nominate Thomas to replace William Brennan, who stepped down in 1990, but Bush decided that Thomas had not yet had enough experience as a judge after only months on the federal bench.[29] Bush nominated New Hampshire Supreme Court judge David Souter (who is not African-American) instead.[29] When Marshall retired due to health reasons in 1991, Bush nominated Thomas, preserving the racial composition of the court.\n\n\nOn February 25, 2022, President Joe Biden announced the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to a seat vacated by the retirement of Stephen Breyer, making Jackson the first African-American woman to be nominated to the court.[30] The Senate confirmed Jackson on April 7, 2022.[31]\n\n\n\n### Hispanic and Latino justices[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Hispanic and Latino American jurists\n\n![](image)Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic justice, with appointing President Barack Obama\nThe words \"Latino\" and \"Hispanic\" are sometimes given distinct meanings, with \"Latino\" referring to persons of Latin American descent, and \"Hispanic\" referring to persons having an ancestry, language or culture traceable to Spain or to the Iberian Peninsula as a whole, as well as to persons of Latin American descent, whereas the term \"Lusitanic\" usually refers to persons having an ancestry, language or culture traceable to Portugal specifically.\n\n\nSonia Sotomayor – nominated by President Barack Obama on May 26, 2009, and sworn in on August 8 – is the first Supreme Court Justice of Latin American descent. Born in New York City of Puerto Rican parents, she has been known to refer to herself as a \"Nuyorican\". Sotomayor is also generally regarded as the first Hispanic justice, although some sources claim that this distinction belongs to former Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo.\n\n\nIt has been claimed that \"only since the George H. W. Bush administration have Hispanic candidates received serious consideration from presidents in the selection process\",[32] and that Emilio M. Garza (considered for the vacancy eventually given to Clarence Thomas[33]) was the first Hispanic judge for whom such an appointment was contemplated.[34] Subsequently, Bill Clinton was reported by several sources to have considered José A. Cabranes for a Supreme Court nomination on both occasions when a court vacancy opened during the Clinton presidency.[35][36] The possibility of an Hispanic justice returned during the George W. Bush Presidency, with various reports suggesting that Emilio M. Garza,[37] Alberto Gonzales,[38] and Consuelo M. Callahan[39] were under consideration for the vacancy left by the retirement of Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor's seat eventually went to Samuel Alito, however. Speculation about a Hispanic nomination arose again after the election of Barack Obama.[40] In 2009, Obama appointed Sonia Sotomayor, a woman of Puerto Rican descent, to be the first unequivocally Hispanic Justice.[41] Both the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials and the Hispanic National Bar Association count Sotomayor as the first Hispanic justice.[42][43] In 2020, President Trump included Cuban-American judge Barbara Lagoa on a list of potential nominees to the court,[44] and Lagoa was reported to be one of several front-runners to fill the vacancy created by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[45][46][47] Ultimately, Amy Coney Barrett was nominated.\n\n\nSome historians contend that Cardozo – a Sephardic Jew believed to be of distant Portuguese descent[48] – should also be counted as the first Hispanic Justice.[1] Schmidhauser wrote in 1979 that \"among the large ethnic groupings of European origin which have never been represented upon the Supreme Court are the Italians, Southern Slavs, and Hispanic Americans.\"[20] The National Hispanic Center for Advanced Studies and Policy Analysis wrote in 1982 that the Supreme Court \"has never had an Hispanic Justice\",[49] and the *Hispanic American Almanac* similarly reported in 1996 that \"no Hispanic has yet sat on the U.S. Supreme Court\".[50] However, Segal and Spaeth state: \"Though it is often claimed that no Hispanics have served on the Court, it is not clear why Benjamin Cardozo, a Sephardic Jew of Spanish heritage, should not count.\" They identify a number of other sources that present conflicting views as to Cardozo's ethnicity, with one simply labeling him \"Iberian.\" In 2007, the *Dictionary of Latino Civil Rights History* also listed Cardozo as \"the first Hispanic named to the Supreme Court of the United States.\"[51]\n\n\nThe nomination of Sonia Sotomayor, widely described in media accounts as the first Hispanic nominee, drew more attention to the question of Cardozo's ethnicity.[42][43][52] Cardozo biographer Andrew Kaufman questioned the usage of the term \"hispanic\" during Cardozo's lifetime, commenting: \"Well, I think he regarded himself as Sephardic Jew whose ancestors came from the Iberian Peninsula.\"[42] However, \"no one has ever firmly established that the family's roots were, in fact, in Portugal\".[43] It has also been asserted that Cardozo himself \"confessed in 1937 that his family preserved neither the Spanish language nor Iberian cultural traditions\".[53] By contrast, Cardozo made his own translations of authoritative legal works written in French and German.[54]\n\n\n\n### Asian and other ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Asian American jurists\n\nAsian-American jurists are poorly represented at all levels of federal judicial system, let alone being Supreme Court justices. According to the Center for American Progress (2019),[55] among active federal judges serving on U.S. courts of appeals, only 10 were Asian Americans (5.7 percent). According to the study by the California Justice Goodwin Liu (2017), of the 94 U.S. attorneys, only three are Asian American; and only 4 of the 2,437 elected prosecutors are Asian American.[56][57] President Trump included Indian-American judge Amul Thapar on a list of potential nominees to the court,[58][59] and Thapar was reported to be one of several front-runners to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Anthony Kennedy.[60][61] Ultimately, Brett Kavanaugh was nominated.\n\n\n\n### Public opinion on ethnic diversity[edit]\n\n\nPublic opinion about ethnic diversity on the court \"varies widely depending on the poll question's wording\".[6] For example, in two polls taken in 1991, one resulted in half of respondents agreeing that it was \"important that there always be at least one black person\" on the court while the other had only 20 percent agreeing with that sentiment, and with 77 percent agreeing that \"race should never be a factor in choosing Supreme Court justices\".[6]\n\n\n\n## Gender[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sandra Day O'Connor, the first female justice, with President Ronald Reagan, who appointed her\n![](image)The first four women who served on the court. From left to right: Justices Sandra Day O'Connor (ret.), Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan. October 1, 2010, prior to Justice Kagan's investiture ceremony.\nOf the 116 justices, 110 (94.8 percent) have been men. All Supreme Court justices were males until 1981, when Ronald Reagan fulfilled his 1980 campaign promise to place a woman on the court,[62] which he did with the appointment of Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor was later joined on the court by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appointed by Bill Clinton in 1993. After O'Connor retired in 2006, Ginsburg was joined by Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who were successfully appointed to the court in 2009 and 2010, respectively, by Barack Obama.[63] In September 2020, following Ginsburg's death, Donald Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett to succeed her.[64] Barrett was confirmed the following month. Only one woman, Harriet Miers, has been nominated to the court unsuccessfully. Her nomination to succeed O'Connor by George W. Bush was withdrawn under fire from both parties, and also marked the first time when a woman was nominated to replace another woman on the court. The nomination of Barrett was the first successful nomination for a woman to succeed another woman. Joe Biden's 2022 nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to a seat vacated by the retirement of Stephen Breyer makes Jackson the first African-American woman to be nominated to the court.[30] The Senate confirmed Jackson on April 7, 2022.[31]\n\n\nSubstantial public sentiment in support of appointment of a woman to the Supreme Court has been expressed since at least as early as 1930, when an editorial in *The Christian Science Monitor* encouraged Herbert Hoover to consider Ohio justice Florence E. Allen or assistant attorney general Mabel Walker Willebrandt.[65] Franklin Delano Roosevelt later appointed Allen to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit—making her \"one of the highest ranking female jurists in the world at that time\".[66] However, neither Roosevelt nor his successors over the following two decades gave strong consideration to female candidates for the court. Harry Truman considered such an appointment but was dissuaded by concerns raised by justices then serving that a woman on the court \"would inhibit their conference deliberations\", which were marked by informality.[66]\n\n\nPresident Richard Nixon named Mildred Lillie, then serving on the Second District Court of Appeal of California, as a potential nominee to fill one of two vacancies on the court in 1971.[62] However, Lillie was quickly deemed unqualified by the American Bar Association, and no formal proceedings were ever set with respect to her potential nomination. Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist were then successfully nominated to fill those vacancies.\n\n\nIn 1991, a poll found that 53 percent of Americans felt it \"important that there always be at least one woman\" on the court.[6] However, when O'Connor stepped down from the court, leaving Justice Ginsburg as the lone remaining woman, only one in seven persons polled found it \"essential that a woman be nominated to replace\" O'Connor.[6]\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen on the Supreme Court\n| Name\n | Appointedfrom\n | Birth\n | Death\n | Yearappointed\n | Leftoffice\n | Appointed by\n | Reason fordeparture\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sandra Day O'Connor | Arizona | 1930 | *living* | 1981 | 2006 | Reagan | retirement\n |\n| Ruth Bader Ginsburg | New York | 1933 | 2020 | 1993 | 2020 | Clinton | death\n |\n| Sonia Sotomayor | New York | 1954 | *living* | 2009 | *incumbent* | Obama | —\n |\n| Elena Kagan | New York | 1960 | *living* | 2010 | *incumbent* | Obama | —\n |\n| Amy Coney Barrett | Indiana | 1972 | *living* | 2020 | *incumbent* | Trump | —\n |\n| Ketanji Brown Jackson | Washington, D.C. | 1970 | *living* | 2022 | *incumbent* | Biden | —\n |\n\n\nGraphical timeline of female justices:\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## Marital status and sexual orientation[edit]\n\n\n### Marital status[edit]\n\n\nAll but a handful of Supreme Court justices have been married. William H. Moody, Frank Murphy, Benjamin Cardozo, and James Clark McReynolds were all lifelong bachelors.[67] In addition, retired justice David Souter and current justice Elena Kagan have never been married.[68][69] William O. Douglas was the first Justice to divorce while on the court and also had the most marriages of any Justice, with four.[67] Justice John Paul Stevens divorced his first wife in 1979, marrying his second wife later that year. Sonia Sotomayor was the first female justice to be appointed as an unmarried woman, having divorced in 1983, long before her nomination in 2009.[67][69] Of the six women who have been appointed to the Court, O'Connor and Ginsburg were the only two military spouses,[70] both having accompanied their spouses to their service posts, though in both cases their spouses had served for only brief periods, decades prior to their appointments.\n\n\nSeveral justices have become widowers while on the bench. The 1792 death of Elizabeth Rutledge, wife of Justice John Rutledge, contributed to the mental health problems that led to the rejection of his recess appointment.[71] Roger B. Taney survived his wife, Anne, by twenty years. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. resolutely continued working on the court for several years after the death of his wife.[72] William Rehnquist was a widower for the last fourteen years of his service on the court, his wife Natalie having died on October 17, 1991, after suffering from ovarian cancer. With the death of Martin D. Ginsburg in June 2010, Ruth Bader Ginsburg became the first woman to be widowed while serving on the court.[73]\n\n\n\n### Sexual orientation[edit]\n\n\nWith regard to sexual orientation, no Supreme Court justice has identified themself as anything other than heterosexual, and no incontrovertible evidence of a justice having any other sexual orientation has ever been uncovered. However, the personal lives of several justices and nominees have attracted speculation.\n\n\nG. Harrold Carswell was unsuccessfully nominated by Richard Nixon in 1970 and was convicted in 1976 of battery for making an \"unnatural and lascivious\" advance to a male police officer working undercover in a Florida men's room.[74] Some therefore claim him as the only gay or bisexual person nominated to the court thus far.[75][76] If so, it is unlikely that Nixon was aware of it; White House Counsel John Dean later wrote of Carswell that \"[w]hile Richard Nixon was always looking for historical firsts, nominating a homosexual to the high court would not have been on his list\".[76]\n\n\nSpeculation has been recorded about the sexual orientation of a few justices who were lifelong bachelors, but no unambiguous evidence exists that they were gay. Perhaps the greatest body of circumstantial evidence surrounds Frank Murphy, who was dogged by \"rumors of homosexuality ... all his adult life\".[77]\n\n\n\n\n> For more than 40 years, Edward G. Kemp was Frank Murphy's devoted, trusted companion. Like Murphy, Kemp was a lifelong bachelor. From college until Murphy's death, the pair found creative ways to work and live together. [...] When Murphy appeared to have the better future in politics, Kemp stepped into a supportive, secondary role.[78]\n> \n> \n\n\nAs well as Murphy's close relationship with Kemp, Murphy's biographer, historian Sidney Fine, found in Murphy's personal papers a letter that \"if the words mean what they say, refers to a homosexual encounter some years earlier between Murphy and the writer.\" However, the letter's veracity cannot be confirmed, and a review of all the evidence led Fine to conclude that he \"could not stick his neck out and say [Murphy] was gay\".[79]\n\n\nSpeculation has also surrounded Benjamin Cardozo, whose celibacy was proposed to suggest repressed homosexuality or asexuality. The fact that he was unmarried and was personally tutored by the writer Horatio Alger (alleged to have had sexual relations with boys) led some of Cardozo's biographers to insinuate that Cardozo was homosexual, but no real evidence exists to corroborate this possibility. Constitutional law scholar Jeffrey Rosen noted in a *The New York Times Book Review* of Richard Polenberg's book on Cardozo:\n\n\n\n\n> Polenberg describes Cardozo's lifelong devotion to his older sister Nell, with whom he lived in New York until her death in 1929. When asked why he had never married, Cardozo replied, quietly and sadly, \"I never could give Nellie the second place in my life.\" Polenberg suggests that friends may have stressed Cardozo's devotion to his sister to discourage rumors \"that he was sexually dysfunctional, or had an unusually low sexual drive or was homosexual.\" But he produces no evidence to support any of these possibilities, except to note that friends, in describing Cardozo, used words like \"beautiful\", \"exquisite\", \"sensitive\" or \"delicate.\"[80]\n> \n> \n\n Andrew Kaufman, author of *Cardozo*, a biography published in 2000, notes that \"Although one cannot be absolutely certain, it seems highly likely that Cardozo lived a celibate life\".[81] Judge Learned Hand is quoted in the book as saying about Cardozo: \"He [had] no trace of homosexuality anyway\".[82]\n\n\nMore recently, when David Souter was nominated to the court, \"conservative groups expressed concern to the White House ... that the president's bachelor nominee might conceivably be a homosexual\".[83] Similar questions were raised regarding the sexual orientation of unmarried nominee Elena Kagan.[84] However, no evidence was ever produced regarding Souter's sexual orientation, and Kagan's apparent heterosexuality was attested by colleagues familiar with her dating history.[85]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nWhen the Supreme Court was established in 1789, the first members came from among the ranks of the Founding Fathers and were almost uniformly Protestant. Of the 116 justices who have been appointed to the court, 92 have been from various Protestant denominations, 15 have been Catholics (one other justice, Sherman Minton, converted to Catholicism after leaving the court). Another, Neil Gorsuch, was raised in the Catholic Church but later attended an Episcopal church, though without specifying the denomination to which he felt he belonged.[86] Eight have been Jewish and one, David Davis, had no known religious affiliation.[87] Three of the 17 chief justices have been Catholics, and one Jewish justice, Abe Fortas, was unsuccessfully nominated to be chief justice.\n\n\nThe table below shows the religious affiliation of each of the justices sitting as of July 2022[update]:\n\n\n\n\n\nReligious makeup of the current court\n| Name\n | Religion\n | Appt. by\n | On the court since\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| John Roberts (Chief Justice)\n | Catholicism\n | G. W. Bush | 2005\n |\n| Clarence Thomas | Catholicism\n | G. H. W.

These have included 33 Episcopalians, 18 Presbyterians, nine Unitarians, five Methodists, three Baptists, two Disciples of Christ, and lone representatives of various other denominations.[89] William Rehnquist and William R. Day were the court's only Lutherans. Noah Swayne was a Quaker. Some fifteen Protestant justices did not adhere to a particular denomination. The religious beliefs of James Wilson, one of the earliest justices, have been the subject of some dispute, as there are writings from various points of his life from which it can be argued that he leaned towards Presbyterianism, Anglicanism, Thomism, or Deism; it has been deemed likely that he eventually favored some form of Christianity.[90] Baptist denominations and other evangelical churches have been underrepresented on the court relative to the population of the United States, and entirely unrepresented since the retirement of Methodist Harry Blackmun in 1994.[89] Conversely, mainline Protestant churches historically were overrepresented.[19]\n\n\nFollowing the retirement of John Paul Stevens in June 2010, the court had an entirely non-Protestant composition for the first time in its history.[91][92] Neil Gorsuch was the first member of a mainline Protestant denomination to sit on the court since Stevens' retirement.[93][h] Ketanji Brown Jackson is a non-denominational Protestant.[98][99]: 1:49:39\n\n\n\n### Catholic justices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Roger B. Taney, the first Catholic Justice\nThe first Catholic justice, Roger B. Taney, was appointed chief justice in 1836 by Andrew Jackson. The second, Edward Douglass White, was appointed as an associate justice in 1894, but also went on to become chief justice. Joseph McKenna was appointed in 1898, placing two Catholics on the court until White's death in 1921. This period marked the beginning of an inconsistently observed \"tradition\" of having a \"Catholic seat\" on the court.[100]\n\n\nOther Catholic justices included Pierce Butler (appointed 1923) and Frank Murphy (appointed 1940). Sherman Minton, appointed in 1949, was a Protestant during his time on the court. To some, however, his wife's Catholic faith implied a \"Catholic seat\".[101] Minton joined his wife's church in 1961, five years after he retired from the court.[102] Minton was succeeded by a Catholic, however, when President Eisenhower appointed William J. Brennan to that seat. Eisenhower sought a Catholic to appoint to the court—in part because there had been no Catholic justice since Murphy's death in 1949, and in part because Eisenhower was directly lobbied by Francis Cardinal Spellman of the Archdiocese of New York to make such an appointment.[103] Brennan was then the lone Catholic justice until the appointment of Antonin Scalia in 1986, and Anthony Kennedy in 1988.\n\n\nLike Sherman Minton, Clarence Thomas was not a Catholic at the time he was appointed to the court. Thomas was raised Catholic and briefly attended Conception Seminary College, a Catholic seminary,[104] but had joined the Protestant denomination of his wife after their marriage. At some point in the late 1990s, Thomas returned to Catholicism. In 2005, John Roberts became the third Catholic Chief Justice and the fourth Catholic on the court. Shortly thereafter, Samuel Alito became the fifth on the court, and the eleventh in the history of the court. Alito's appointment gave the court a Catholic majority for the first time in its history. Besides Thomas, at least one other Justice, James F. Byrnes, was raised as a Catholic, but converted to a different branch of Christianity prior to serving on the court.\n\n\nIn contrast to historical patterns, the court has gone from having a \"Catholic seat\" to being what some have characterized as a \"Catholic court\". The reasons for that are subject to debate.[105] The fact that most recent Catholic appointees were also ideologically conservative has led some partisan critics to derisively refer to the court as \"a Catholic boys club\".[106] However in May 2009, President Barack Obama nominated a Catholic woman, Sonia Sotomayor, to replace retiring Justice David Souter.[107] Her confirmation raised the number of Catholics on the court to six, compared to three non-Catholics. With Antonin Scalia's death in February 2016, the number of Catholic justices went back to five. Scalia's replacement, Neil Gorsuch, appointed in 2017, was raised Catholic but attends and is a member of an Episcopal church; it is unclear if he identifies as a Catholic as well as belonging to the Episcopal Church.[86] Following Anthony Kennedy's retirement in July 2018, the number of Catholic justices remained unchanged as he was succeeded by Catholic Brett Kavanaugh. In September 2020, following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Donald Trump nominated another Catholic, Amy Coney Barrett to succeed her.[64]\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic justices\n| Name\n | Appointedfrom\n | Birth\n | Death\n | Yearappointed\n | Leftoffice\n | Appointed by\n | Reason fortermination\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roger B.

Benjamin to be the first Jewish justice, and *The New York Times* reported (on February 15, 1853) that \"if the President nominates Benjamin, the Democrats are determined to confirm him\". However, Benjamin declined the offer, and ultimately became Secretary of State for the Confederacy during the Civil War. The first Jewish nominee, Louis Brandeis, was appointed in 1916, after a tumultuous hearing process. The 1932 appointment of Benjamin Cardozo raised mild controversy for placing two Jewish justices on the court at the same time, although the appointment was widely lauded based on Cardozo's qualifications, and the Senate was unanimous in confirming Cardozo.[108] Most Jewish Supreme Court justices were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, with the exception of Cardozo, who was Sephardic. None of the Jewish Supreme Court justices have practiced Orthodox Judaism while on the court, although Abe Fortas was raised Orthodox.[109]\n\n\nCardozo was succeeded by another Jewish justice, Felix Frankfurter, but Brandeis was succeeded by Protestant William O. Douglas. Negative reaction to the appointment of the early Jewish justices did not exclusively come from outside the court. Justice James Clark McReynolds, a blatant anti-semite, refused to speak to Brandeis for three years following the latter's appointment and when Brandeis retired in 1939, did not sign the customary dedicatory letter sent to court members on their retirement. During Benjamin Cardozo's swearing in ceremony McReynolds pointedly read a newspaper muttering \"another one\" and did not attend that of Felix Frankfurter, exclaiming \"My God, another Jew on the Court!\"[110]\n\n\nFrankfurter was followed by Arthur Goldberg and Abe Fortas, each of whom filled what became known as the \"Jewish seat\".[111] After Fortas resigned in 1969, he was replaced by Protestant Harry Blackmun. No Jewish justices were nominated thereafter until Ronald Reagan nominated Douglas H. Ginsburg in 1987, to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Lewis F. Powell; however, this nomination was withdrawn, and the court remained without any Jewish justices until 1993, when Ruth Bader Ginsburg (unrelated to Douglas Ginsburg) was appointed to replace Byron White. Ginsburg was followed in relatively quick succession by the appointment of Stephen Breyer, also Jewish, in 1994 to replace Harry Blackmun. In 2010, the confirmation of President Barack Obama's nomination of Elena Kagan to the court created the possibility that three Jewish justices would serve simultaneously. Prior to this confirmation, conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan stated that, \"If Kagan is confirmed, Jews, who represent less than 2 percent of the U.S. population, will have 33 percent of the Supreme Court seats\".[112] At the time of his remarks, 6.4 percent of justices in the history of the court had been Jewish. Justice Ginsburg's death in 2020 and Breyer's retirement in 2022 reduced the number to one.\n\n\n\n\n\nJewish justices\n| Name\n | Appointedfrom\n | Birth\n | Death\n | Yearappointed\n | Leftoffice\n | Appointed by\n | Reason fordeparture\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Louis Brandeis | Kentucky | 1856 | 1941 | 1916 | 1939 | Wilson | retirement\n |\n| Benjamin N.

Clarence Thomas, who had been raised as a Catholic but had attended an Episcopal church after his marriage, returned to Catholicism later in the 1990s. At this point, the four remaining Protestant justices—Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, and Souter—remained a plurality on the court, but for the first time in the history of the court, Protestants were no longer an absolute majority.\n\n\nThe first Catholic plurality on the court occurred in 2005, when Chief Justice Rehnquist was succeeded in office by Chief Justice John Roberts, who became the fourth sitting Catholic justice. On January 31, 2006, Samuel Alito became the fifth sitting Catholic justice, and on August 6, 2009, Sonia Sotomayor became the sixth. By contrast, there have only been two Catholic U.S. Presidents, John F. Kennedy (unrelated to Justice Kennedy) and Joe Biden, who was previously the only Catholic to serve as Vice President. There has never been a Jewish U.S. President or Vice President.\n\n\nAt the beginning of 2010, Justice John Paul Stevens was the sole remaining Protestant on the court.[107][113] In April 2010, Justice Stevens announced his retirement, effective as of the court's 2010 summer recess. Upon Justice Stevens' retirement, which formally began on June 28, 2010, the court lacked a Protestant member, marking the first time in its history that it was exclusively composed of Jewish and Catholic justices.[91] Although in January 2017, after seven years with no Protestant justices serving or nominated, President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the court, as noted above it is unclear whether Gorsuch considers himself a Catholic or an Episcopalian.[114][86] Following the retirement of Justice Kennedy, the Catholic majority on the court was extended by the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh;[115] the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett increased this majority to six Catholic members of the court, or seven if Gorsuch is classified as a Catholic.[86]\n\n\nThis development led to some comment. Law school professor Jeffrey Rosen wrote that \"it's a fascinating truth that we've allowed religion to drop out of consideration on the Supreme Court, and right now, we have a Supreme Court that religiously at least, by no means looks like America\".[116]\n\n\n\n### Unrepresented religions[edit]\n\n\nA number of sizable religious groups, each less than two percent of the total U.S. population,[117] have had no members appointed as justices. These include Orthodox Christians, Mormons, Pentecostals, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and members of Native American religions. George Sutherland has been described as a \"lapsed Mormon\"[118] because he was raised in the LDS Church, his parents having immigrated to the United States during Sutherland's infancy to join that church.[119] Sutherland's parents soon left the LDS Church and moved to Montana.[119] Sutherland himself also disaffiliated with the faith, but remained in Utah and graduated from Brigham Young Academy in 1881, the only non-Mormon in his class.[120] In 1975, Attorney General Edward H. Levi had listed Dallin H. Oaks, a Mormon who had clerked for Earl Warren and was then president of Brigham Young University, as a potential nominee for Gerald Ford. Ford \"crossed Oaks's name off the list early on, noting in the margin that a member of the LDS Church might bring a 'confirmation fight'\".[121]\n\n\nNo professing atheist has ever been appointed to the court, although some justices have declined to engage in religious activity, or affiliate with a denomination. As an adult, Benjamin Cardozo no longer practiced his faith and identified himself as an agnostic, though he remained proud of his Jewish heritage.[122]\n\n\n\n## Age[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the oldest justice in history, served on the court until he was 90.\nUnlike the offices of President, U.S. Representative, and U.S. Senator, there is no minimum age for Supreme Court justices set forth in the United States Constitution. However, justices tend to be appointed after having made significant achievements in law or politics, which excludes many young potential candidates from consideration. At the same time, justices appointed at too advanced an age will likely have short tenures on the court.\n\n\nThe youngest justice ever appointed was Joseph Story, 32 at the time of his appointment in 1812; the oldest was Charles Evans Hughes, who was 67 at the time of his appointment as Chief Justice in 1930. (Hughes had previously been appointed to the court as an associate justice in 1910, at the age of 48, but had resigned in 1916 to run for president). Story went on to serve for 33 years, while Hughes served 11 years after his second appointment. The oldest justice at the time of his initial appointment was Horace Lurton, 65 at the time of his appointment in 1909. Lurton died after only four years on the court. The oldest sitting justice to be elevated to Chief Justice was Hughes' successor, Harlan Fiske Stone, who was 68 at the time of his elevation in 1941. Stone died in 1946, only five years after his elevation. The oldest nominee to the court was South Carolina senator William Smith, nominated in 1837, then aged around 75 (it is known that he was born in 1762, but not the exact date). The Senate confirmed Smith's nomination by a vote of 23–18, but Smith declined to serve.[123] Smith died three years later.\n\n\nOf the justices sitting as of June 13, 2024, Amy Coney Barrett is the youngest, at 52 years, 137 days old, while Clarence Thomas is the oldest at 75 years, 356 days. The oldest person to have served on the court was Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who stepped down two months shy of his 91st birthday.[124] John Paul Stevens, second only to Holmes,[124] left the court in June 2010, two months after turning 90.\n\n\n\n![](image)Joseph Story was only 32 when he became a justice of the court.\nThe average age of the court as a whole fluctuates over time with the departure of older justices and the appointment of younger people to fill their seats. As of 2022[update], the youngest sitting Justice at the time of appointment is Clarence Thomas, who was 43 years old at the time of his confirmation in 1991. Following the appointment of Ketanji Brown Jackson, the average age of the court is between 61 and 62 years old. By contrast, just prior to the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist in September 2005, the average age was 71. After Jackson's appointment and confirmation in 2022, the average age of appointment for current justices is between 50 and 51 years old.\n\n\nThe longest period of time in which one group of justices has served together occurred from August 3, 1994, when Stephen Breyer was appointed to replace the retired Harry Blackmun, to September 3, 2005, the death of Rehnquist, totaling 11 years and 31 days. From 1789 until 1970, justices served an average of 14.9 years. Those who have stepped down since 1970 have served an average of 25.6 years. The retirement age had jumped from an average of 68 pre-1970 to 79 for justices retiring post-1970. Between 1789 and 1970 there was a vacancy on the court once every 1.91 years. In the next 34 years since the two appointments in 1971, there was a vacancy on average only once every 3.75 years. The typical one-term president has had one appointment opportunity instead of two.[125]\n\n\nCommentators have noted that advances in medical knowledge \"have enormously increased the life expectancy of a mature person of an age likely to be considered for appointment to the Supreme Court\".[126] Combined with the reduction in responsibilities carried out by modern justices as compared to the early justices, this results in much longer potential terms of service.[126] This has led to proposals such as imposing a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices,[127] or predetermined term limits.[128]\n\n\n\n## Educational background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of law schools attended by United States Supreme Court justices\n\n![](image)Stanley F. Reed was the last sitting justice to have not graduated from law school.\nAlthough the Constitution imposes no educational background requirements for federal judges, the work of the court involves complex questions of law—ranging from constitutional law to administrative law to admiralty law—and consequently, a legal education has become a *de facto* prerequisite to appointment on the Supreme Court. Every person who has been nominated to the court has been an attorney.[7]\n\n\nBefore the advent of modern law schools in the United States, justices, like most attorneys of the time, completed their legal studies by \"reading law\" (studying under and acting as an apprentice to more experienced attorneys) rather than attending a formal program. The first justice to be appointed who had attended an actual law school was Levi Woodbury, appointed to the court in 1846. Woodbury had attended Tapping Reeve Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut, prior to his admission to the bar in 1812. However, Woodbury did not receive a law degree. Woodbury's successor on the court, Benjamin Robbins Curtis, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1832, and was appointed to the court in 1851, was the first justice to bear such a credential.[129]\n\n\nAssociate justices James F. Byrnes, whose short tenure lasted from June 1941 to October 1942, and Robert H. Jackson, who served from July 1941 to October 1954, were the last two justices to be appointed without having graduated from law school; Stanley Forman Reed, who served on the court from 1938 to 1957, was the last sitting justice from such a background. In total, of the 115 justices appointed to the court, 49 have graduated from law school, an additional 18 attended some law school but did not graduate, and 47 received their legal education without any law school attendance.[129] Two justices, Sherman Minton and Lewis F. Powell Jr., earned a Master of Laws degree.[130] Of those who attended law school, 40 attended one of three specific institutions: Harvard Law School, Yale Law School, and Columbia Law School. Furthermore, an overwhelming majority of law school attendees appointed to the court attended a private law school rather than a public law school.\n\n\nIn 1970, G. Harrold Carswell, was nominated as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court – to occupy the seat vacated by Abe Fortas. During the debate of the nomination, Nebraska Republican Roman Hruska intoned in a TV interview, \"Even if he [Carswell] were mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a little representation, aren't they? We can't have all Brandeises and Frankfurters and Cardozos.\"[131]\n\n\nThe table below shows the college and law school from which each of the currently sitting justices graduated:\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic history of the current court\n| Name\n | Appt. by\n | College\n | Law school\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| John Roberts (Chief Justice)\n | G. W. Bush | Harvard | Harvard |\n| Clarence Thomas | G. H. W.

Few justices have a background as criminal defense lawyers, and Thurgood Marshall is reportedly the last justice to have had a client in a death penalty case.[132]\n\n\nHistorically, justices have come from some tradition of public service; only George Shiras Jr. had no such experience.[133] Relatively few justices have been appointed from among members of Congress. Six were members of the United States Senate at the time of their appointment,[134][135] while one was a sitting member of the House of Representatives.[136] Six more had previously served in the Senate. Three have been sitting governors.[134][137] Only one, William Howard Taft, had been President of the United States.[138] The last justice to have held elected office was Sandra Day O'Connor, who was elected twice to the Arizona State Senate after being appointed there by the governor.\n\n\nPredominantly, recent justices have had experience in the Executive branch. The last Member of Congress to be nominated was Sherman Minton. The last nominee to have any Legislative branch experience was Sandra Day O'Connor.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], 42 justices have been military veterans.[139] Numerous justices were appointed who had served in the American Revolutionary War, the American Civil War (including three who had served in the Confederate States Army), World War I and World War II. However, no justice has been appointed who has served in any subsequent war. The last justice to have served in the military during wartime was John Paul Stevens, who was in naval intelligence during World War II.[140]\n\n\n\n## Financial means[edit]\n\n\nThe financial position of the typical Supreme Court Justice has been described as \"upper-middle to high social status: reared in nonrural but not necessarily urban environment, member of a civic-minded, politically active, economically comfortable family\".[129] Charles A. Beard, in his *An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States*, profiled those among the justices who were also drafters of the Constitution.\n\n\nJames Wilson, Beard notes, \"developed a lucrative practice at Carlisle\" before becoming \"one of the directors of the Bank of North America on its incorporation in 1781\".[141] A member of the Georgia Land Company, Wilson \"held shares to the amount of at least one million acres\".[142] John Blair was \"one of the most respectable men in Virginia, both on account of his Family as well as fortune\".[143] Another source notes that Blair \"was a member of a prominent Virginia family. His father served on the Virginia Council and was for a time acting Royal governor. His granduncle, James Blair, was founder and first president of the College of William and Mary.\"[144] John Rutledge was elected Governor of South Carolina at a time when the Constitution of that state set, as a qualification for the office, ownership of \"a settled plantation or freehold ... of the value of at least ten thousand pounds currency, clear of debt\".[145] Oliver Ellsworth \"rose rapidly to wealth and power in the bar of his native state\" with \"earnings... unrivalled in his own day and unexampled in the history of the colony\", developing \"a fortune which for the times and the country was quite uncommonly large\".[146] Bushrod Washington was the nephew of George Washington, who was at the time of the younger Washington's appointment the immediate past President of the United States and one of the wealthiest men in the country.[147]\n\n\n\"About three-fifths of those named to the Supreme Court personally knew the President who nominated them\".[103] There have been exceptions to the typical portrait of justices growing up middle class or wealthy. For example, the family of Sherman Minton went through a period of impoverishment during his childhood, resulting from the disability of his father due to a heat stroke.[148]\n\n\nIn 2008, seven of the nine sitting justices were millionaires, and the remaining two were close to that level of wealth.[149] Historian Howard Zinn, in his 1980 book *A People's History of the United States*, argues that the justices cannot be neutral in matters between rich and poor, as they are almost always from the upper class.[150] Chief Justice Roberts is the son of an executive with Bethlehem Steel; Justice Stevens was born into a wealthy Chicago family;[151] and Justices Kennedy and Breyer both had fathers who were successful attorneys. Justices Alito and Scalia both had educated (and education-minded) parents: Scalia's father was a highly educated college professor and Alito's father was a high school teacher before becoming \"a long-time employee of the New Jersey state legislature\".[152] Only Justices Thomas and Sotomayor have been regarded as coming from a lower-class background. One authority states that \"Thomas grew up in poverty. The Pin Point community he lived in lacked a sewage system and paved roads. Its inhabitants dwelled in destitution and earned but a few cents each day performing manual labor\".[153] The depth of Thomas's poverty has been disputed by suggestions of \"ample evidence to suggest that Thomas enjoyed, by and large, a middle-class upbringing\".[154]\n\n\n\n### Financial disclosures[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1979, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 required federal officials, including the justices, to file annual disclosures of their income and assets.[155] These disclosures provide a snapshot into the wealth of the justices, reported within broad ranges, from year to year since 1979. In the first such set of disclosures, only two justices were revealed to be millionaires: Potter Stewart[156] and Lewis F. Powell,[157] with Chief Justice Warren Burger coming in third with about $600,000 in holdings.[156] The least wealthy Justice was Thurgood Marshall.[156]\n\n\nThe 1982 report disclosed that newly appointed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was a millionaire, and the second-wealthiest Justice on the court (after Powell).[158] The remaining justices listed assets in the range of tens of thousands to a few hundred-thousand, with the exception of Thurgood Marshall, who \"reported no assets or investment income of more than $100\".[158] The 1985 report had the justices in relatively the same positions,[159] while the 1992 report had O'Connor as the wealthiest member of the court, with Stevens being the only other millionaire, most other justices reporting assets averaging around a half million dollars, and the two newest justices, Clarence Thomas and David Souter, reporting assets of at least $65,000.[160] In 2011, however, it was revealed that Thomas had misstated his income going back to at least 1989.[161][162][163]\n\n\nThe 2007 report was the first to reflect the holdings of John Roberts and Samuel Alito. Disclosures for that year indicated that Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy were the only justices who were clearly not millionaires, although Thomas was reported to have signed a book deal worth over one million dollars.[164] Other justices have reported holdings within the following ranges:[165][166]\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal wealth of selected recent justices\n| Justice\n | Lowest range\n | Highest range\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| John Roberts\n | $2,400,000 | $6,200,000\n |\n| John Paul Stevens\n | $1,100,000 | $3,500,000\n |\n| Anthony Kennedy\n | $365,000 | $765,000\n |\n| David Souter\n | ? | ?\n |\n| Clarence Thomas\n | $150,000 | $410,000\n |\n| Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n | $5,000,000 | $25,000,000\n |\n| Stephen Breyer\n | $4,900,000 | $16,800,000\n |\n| Samuel Alito\n | $770,000 | $2,000,000\n |\n| Neil Gorsuch\n | $3,200,000 | $7,300,000\n |\n\n\nThe financial disclosures indicate that many of the justices have substantial stock holdings.[164] This, in turn, has affected the business of the court, as these holdings have led justices to recuse themselves from cases, occasionally with substantial impact. For example, in 2008, the recusal of John Roberts in one case, and Samuel Alito in another, resulted in each ending in a 4–4 split, which does not create a binding precedent.[167] The court was unable to decide another case in 2008 because four of the nine justices had conflicts, three arising from stock ownership in affected companies.[168]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Ideological leanings of United States Supreme Court justices\n* List of U.S. Supreme Court justices who also served in the U.S. Congress\n* List of law schools attended by United States Supreme Court justices\n* List of justices of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** David J.

A successful nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, was born in Washington, D.C., and appointed from there, but spent a substantial portion of her life in Florida.\n4. **^** An unsuccessful nominee, George Henry Williams, was from Oregon.\n5. **^** West Virginia could be argued to have produced no Supreme Court justices back to the inaugural Court – it was part of Virginia between 1788 and 1863, and none of Virginia's five antebellum Supreme Court justices hailed from what became West Virginia.\n6. **^** Barack Obama considered appointing Sidney R. Thomas, a Federal judge from Montana, to the Supreme Court in 2010\n7. **^** According to the Social Security Administration Popular baby name database, Thurgood has never been in the top 1,000 of male baby names.\n8. **^** Although Neil Gorsuch, appointed in 2017, attends and is a member of an Episcopal church, he was raised Catholic and some of his acquaintances were unsure if he considered himself a Catholic who is also a member of a Protestant church, or simply a Protestant.[86] However, at his 2017 confirmation hearing, when asked a question about his faith, Gorsuch responded, \"I attend an Episcopal church in Boulder with my family, Senator.\"[94][95] Prior to his appointment he was an active member of Holy Comforter Episcopal Church and then St. John's Episcopal Church in Boulder, Colorado.[96][97]\n9. **^** This individual was elevated from associate justice to chief justice. Unlike the inferior courts, the chief justice is separately nominated and subject to a separate confirmation process, regardless of whether or not they are already an Associate Justice.\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** There are two types of retirement. First, a justice can resign an appointment in return for a pension, and the \"Reason Appointment Terminated\" is marked as \"retirement\". Alternatively, a justice can retire and assume senior status. The justice's appointment does not end; instead, the justice accepts a reduced workload on an inferior court. For instance, Stanley Forman Reed was frequently assigned to the Court of Claims when he was in senior status. As of 2006[update], every justice except Charles Evans Whittaker who assumed senior status has died in it; in that case, the judge will have the \"Reason Appointment Terminated\" as \"death\", even though the justice retired from the court before they died.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Segal and Spaeth (2002). *The Supreme Court and the Attitudinal Model Revisited*. p. 183.`{{cite book}}`: CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list (link)\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** O'Brien (2003). *Storm Center*. p. 46.`{{cite book}}`: CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list (link)\n3. **^** O'Brien (2003). *Storm Center*. p. 54.`{{cite book}}`: CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list (link)\n4. **^** John P.

The family into which Benjamin Nathan Cardozo was born ... was a Sephardic family, descended from those Jews who had fled from the Iberian peninsula during the Inquisition and had come to America via the Netherlands and England. Both branches of the family (the Cardozos and the Nathans) had arrived in the American colonies before the American Revolution. Cardozo family tradition holds that their ancestors were Portuguese Marranos—Jews who practiced Judaism secretly after forced conversion to Christianity—who fled the Inquisition in the seventeenth century. They took refuge first in Holland and then in London. Later members of the family emigrated to the New World. Aaron Cardozo, was the first Cardozo to settle in the American colonies, arriving in New York from London in 1752.\n22. **^** Biskupic, Joan (November 10, 2009). *American Original: The Life and Constitution of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia*.

Some of these characteristics have been raised as an issue since the court was established in 1789. For its first 180 years, justices were almost always white male Protestants of Anglo or Northwestern European descent.[1]\n\n\nPrior to the 20th century, a few Catholics were appointed, but concerns about diversity on the court were mainly in terms of geographic diversity, to represent all geographic regions of the country, as opposed to ethnic, religious, or gender diversity.[2] The 20th century saw the first appointment of justices who were Jewish (Louis Brandeis, 1916), African-American (Thurgood Marshall, 1967), female (Sandra Day O'Connor, 1981), and Italian-American (Antonin Scalia, 1986). The first appointment of a Hispanic justice was in the 21st century with Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, with the possible exception of Justice Benjamin Cardozo, a Sephardi Jew of Portuguese descent, who was appointed in 1932.\n\n\nIn spite of the interest in the court's demographics and the symbolism accompanying the inevitably political appointment process,[3] and the views of some commentators that no demographic considerations should arise in the selection process,[4][5] the gender, race, educational background or religious views of the justices has played little documented role in their jurisprudence. For example, the opinions of the first two African-American justices reflected radically different judicial philosophies; William Brennan and Antonin Scalia shared Catholic faith and a Harvard Law School education, but shared little in the way of jurisprudential philosophies. The court's first two female justices voted together no more often than with their male colleagues, and historian Thomas R. Marshall writes that no particular \"female perspective\" can be discerned from their opinions.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Geographic background[edit]\n\n\nFor most of the existence of the court, geographic diversity was a key concern of presidents in choosing justices to appoint.[2] This was prompted in part by the early practice of Supreme Court justices also \"riding circuit\"—individually hearing cases in different regions of the country. In 1789, the United States was divided into judicial circuits, and from that time until 1891, Supreme Court justices also acted as judges within those individual circuits.[7] George Washington was careful to make appointments \"with no two justices serving at the same time hailing from the same state\".[8] Abraham Lincoln broke with this tradition during the Civil War,[7] and \"by the late 1880s presidents disregarded it with increasing frequency\".[9]\n\n\nAlthough the importance of regionalism declined, it still arose from time to time. For example, in appointing Benjamin Cardozo in 1929, President Hoover was as concerned about the controversy over having three New York justices on the court as he was about having two Jewish justices.[10] David M. O'Brien notes that \"from the appointment of John Rutledge from South Carolina in 1789 until the retirement of Hugo Black [from Alabama] in 1971, with the exception of the Reconstruction decade of 1866–1876, there was always a southerner on the bench. Until 1867, the sixth seat was reserved as the \"southern seat\". Until Cardozo's appointment in 1932, the third seat was reserved for New Englanders.\"[11] The westward expansion of the U.S. led to concerns that the western states should be represented on the court as well, which purportedly prompted William Howard Taft to make his 1910 appointment of Willis Van Devanter of Wyoming.[12]\n\n\nGeographic balance was sought in the 1970s, when Nixon attempted to employ a \"Southern strategy\", hoping to secure support from Southern states by nominating judges from the region.[1] Nixon unsuccessfully nominated Southerners Clement Haynsworth of South Carolina and G. Harrold Carswell of Florida, before finally succeeding with the nomination of Harry Blackmun of Minnesota.[13] The issue of regional diversity was again raised with the 2010 retirement of John Paul Stevens, who had been appointed from the midwestern Seventh Circuit, leaving the court with all but one Justice having been appointed from states on the East Coast.[14]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the court has a majority from the Northeastern United States, with five justices coming from states to the north and east of Washington, D.C.: two justices born in New York (two in New York City), one in New Jersey, and two from Washington, D.C., itself. The remaining four justices come from Georgia, California, Colorado, and Indiana; until the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana in 2020, the most recent justice from the Midwest had been John Paul Stevens of Illinois who retired in 2010. Contemporary justices may be associated with multiple states. Many nominees are appointed while serving in states or districts other than their hometown or home state. Chief Justice John Roberts, for example, was born in Buffalo, New York, but moved to Indiana at the age of ten, where he grew up. After law school, Roberts worked in Washington, D.C., while living in Maryland. Thus, three states may claim to be his home state. Justice Barrett is another example; although her commission identifies her as being from Indiana, she was born in New Orleans, raised in the adjacent suburb of Metairie, Louisiana, and did not live in Indiana until law school.\n\n\nSome states have been over-represented, partly because there were fewer states from which early justices could be appointed. New York has produced fifteen justices, three of whom have served as chief justice. Ohio has produced ten justices, including two chief justices; Massachusetts nine (including Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan); and Virginia eight, including three chief justices. There have been six justices each from Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Maryland (the latter including current chief justice John Roberts and current associate justice Brett Kavanaugh); and five each from Kentucky and New Jersey.[13] States that have produced four justices include California, Illinois (one chief and three associates each), and Georgia.\n\n\n\n![](image)David J. Brewer was born to missionary parents in Smyrna, in the Ottoman Empire, (now İzmir, Turkey).\n### Other states from which justices have been appointed[edit]\n\n\n* Three justices have been appointed from Connecticut (2 chiefs and 1 associate).\n* Three justices have been appointed from South Carolina (1 chief, 1 chief who was earlier an associate, and 1 associate).\n* Three associate justices have been appointed from Alabama.\n* Two associate justices have been appointed from Colorado, including current associate justice Neil Gorsuch.\n* Two associate justices have been appointed from Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, and New Hampshire.\n* One associate justice has been appointed from Arizona, while another associate justice who later became chief was born there had moved to Virginia prior to their appointment.\n* One justice, who served both as an associate and as chief, has been appointed from Louisiana; current associate justice Amy Coney Barrett was born there but had moved to Indiana prior to her appointment.\n* One associate justice has been appointed from Kansas, Maine, Missouri, Mississippi, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming.\n\n\n### States from which no justices have been appointed[edit]\n\n\nDespite the efforts to achieve geographic balance, only seven justices[a] have ever hailed from states admitted after or during the Civil War. Nineteen states have never produced a Supreme Court justice. In order of admission to the Union these are:\n\n\n\n1. Delaware (original state)\n2. Rhode Island (original state)\n3. Vermont (admitted in 1791)\n4. Arkansas (admitted in 1836)[b]\n5. Florida (admitted in 1845)[c]\n6. Wisconsin (admitted in 1848)\n7. Oregon (admitted in 1859)[d]\n8.

Hawaii (admitted in 1959)\n\n### Foreign birth[edit]\n\n\nSix justices were born outside the United States. These included James Wilson (1789–1798), born in Ceres, Fife, Scotland; James Iredell (1790–1799), born in Lewes, England; and William Paterson (1793–1806), born in County Antrim, then in the Kingdom of Ireland. Justice David J. Brewer (1889–1910) was born farthest from the U.S., in Smyrna, in the Ottoman Empire, (now İzmir, Turkey), where his parents were missionaries at the time.[16] George Sutherland (1922–1939) was born in Buckinghamshire, England. The last foreign-born justice, and the only one of these for whom English was a second language, was Felix Frankfurter (1939–1962), born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now in Austria).[17][18] The Constitution imposes no citizenship requirement on federal judges.\n\n\n\n## Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nAll Supreme Court justices were white and of mostly Northwestern European heritage until the appointment of Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Justice, in 1967. Since then, only three other non-white justices have been appointed: Marshall's African-American successor, Clarence Thomas, in 1991, Latina Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, and African-American Ketanji Brown Jackson in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-white justice\n| Name\n | Appointedfrom\n | Birth\n | Death\n | Yearappointed\n | Leftoffice\n | Appointed by\n | Reason fordeparture\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Thurgood Marshall | Maryland | 1908 | 1993 | 1967 | 1991 | Johnson | retirement\n |\n| Clarence Thomas | Georgia | 1948 | *living* | 1991 | *incumbent* | G.

There have been several justices of Irish or Ulster Scots descent, with William Paterson born in Ireland to an Ulster Scots Protestant family and Joseph McKenna, Edward Douglas White, Pierce Butler, Frank Murphy, William J. Brennan Jr., Anthony Kennedy, and Brett Kavanaugh being of Irish Catholic origin. There have been five justices of French ancestry in John Jay, Gabriel Duval, Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar, Joseph Rucker Lamar[19] and Amy Coney Barrett, with all except the Catholic Barrett being Protestants of Huguenot origins. Many justices – including John Jay, William Johnson, and Willis Van Devanter – have been of Dutch Protestant origin,[19] while two Protestant Scandinavian Americans to serve on the court have been Chief Justices Earl Warren[19] and William Rehnquist.\n\n\nUp until the 1980s, only eight justices of \"central, eastern, or southern European derivation\" had been appointed, and even among these justices, five of them \"were of Germanic background, which includes Austrian, German-Bohemian, and Swiss origins (John Catron, Samuel F. Miller, Louis Brandeis, Felix Frankfurter, and Warren Burger)\", with Brandeis and Frankfurter being of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, while only one justice was of non-Germanic, Southern European descent (Benjamin N. Cardozo, of Sephardic Jewish descent).[20] Cardozo, appointed to the court in 1932, was the first justice known to have non-Germanic, non-Anglo-Saxon or non-Irish ancestry and the first justice of Southern European descent.[*citation needed*] Both of Justice Cardozo's parents descended from Sephardic Jews from the Iberian Peninsula who fled to Holland during the Spanish Inquisition, then to London, before arriving in New York prior to the American Revolution.[21][*page needed*] At least two, Abe Fortas and Arthur Goldberg, were of Eastern European Ashkenazi descent.\n\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia, who served from 1986 to 2016, and Justice Samuel Alito, who has served since 2006, are the first justices of Italian descent to be appointed to the Supreme Court. Justice Scalia's father and both maternal grandparents as well as both of Justice Alito's parents were born in Italy.[22][23][24] Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was born to a Jewish father who immigrated from Russia at age 13 and a Jewish mother who was born four months after her parents immigrated from Poland.[25]\n\n\nAmong white ethnicities, according to 1959 and 1979 articles by Schmidhauser, there had never been a Justice with any Slavic ancestry.[19][20]\n\n\n\n### African-American justices[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of African-American jurists\n\n![](image)Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Justice, speaking with his appointing President, Lyndon B. Johnson\nNo African-American candidate was given serious consideration for appointment to the Supreme Court until the election of John F. Kennedy, who weighed the possibility of appointing William H. Hastie of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.[26] Hastie had been the first African-American elevated to a Court of Appeals when Harry S. Truman had so appointed him in 1949, and by the time of the Kennedy Administration, it was widely anticipated that Hastie might be appointed to the Supreme Court.[27] Kennedy gave serious consideration to this appointment, ensuring that this \"represented the first time in American history that an African American was an actual contender for the high court\".[26]\n\n\nThe first African-American appointed to the court was Thurgood Marshall, appointed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967. Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was \"the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place.\" Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 31, 1967.[28] Johnson confidently predicted to one biographer, Doris Kearns Goodwin, that a lot of black baby boys would be named \"Thurgood\" in honor of this choice (in fact, Kearns's research of birth records in New York and Boston indicates that Johnson's prophecy did not come true).[g]\n\n\nThe second was Clarence Thomas, appointed by George H. W. Bush to succeed Marshall in 1991. Bush initially wanted to nominate Thomas to replace William Brennan, who stepped down in 1990, but Bush decided that Thomas had not yet had enough experience as a judge after only months on the federal bench.[29] Bush nominated New Hampshire Supreme Court judge David Souter (who is not African-American) instead.[29] When Marshall retired due to health reasons in 1991, Bush nominated Thomas, preserving the racial composition of the court.\n\n\nOn February 25, 2022, President Joe Biden announced the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to a seat vacated by the retirement of Stephen Breyer, making Jackson the first African-American woman to be nominated to the court.[30] The Senate confirmed Jackson on April 7, 2022.[31]\n\n\n\n### Hispanic and Latino justices[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Hispanic and Latino American jurists\n\n![](image)Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic justice, with appointing President Barack Obama\nThe words \"Latino\" and \"Hispanic\" are sometimes given distinct meanings, with \"Latino\" referring to persons of Latin American descent, and \"Hispanic\" referring to persons having an ancestry, language or culture traceable to Spain or to the Iberian Peninsula as a whole, as well as to persons of Latin American descent, whereas the term \"Lusitanic\" usually refers to persons having an ancestry, language or culture traceable to Portugal specifically.\n\n\nSonia Sotomayor – nominated by President Barack Obama on May 26, 2009, and sworn in on August 8 – is the first Supreme Court Justice of Latin American descent. Born in New York City of Puerto Rican parents, she has been known to refer to herself as a \"Nuyorican\". Sotomayor is also generally regarded as the first Hispanic justice, although some sources claim that this distinction belongs to former Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo.\n\n\nIt has been claimed that \"only since the George H. W. Bush administration have Hispanic candidates received serious consideration from presidents in the selection process\",[32] and that Emilio M. Garza (considered for the vacancy eventually given to Clarence Thomas[33]) was the first Hispanic judge for whom such an appointment was contemplated.[34] Subsequently, Bill Clinton was reported by several sources to have considered José A. Cabranes for a Supreme Court nomination on both occasions when a court vacancy opened during the Clinton presidency.[35][36] The possibility of an Hispanic justice returned during the George W. Bush Presidency, with various reports suggesting that Emilio M. Garza,[37] Alberto Gonzales,[38] and Consuelo M. Callahan[39] were under consideration for the vacancy left by the retirement of Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor's seat eventually went to Samuel Alito, however. Speculation about a Hispanic nomination arose again after the election of Barack Obama.[40] In 2009, Obama appointed Sonia Sotomayor, a woman of Puerto Rican descent, to be the first unequivocally Hispanic Justice.[41] Both the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials and the Hispanic National Bar Association count Sotomayor as the first Hispanic justice.[42][43] In 2020, President Trump included Cuban-American judge Barbara Lagoa on a list of potential nominees to the court,[44] and Lagoa was reported to be one of several front-runners to fill the vacancy created by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[45][46][47] Ultimately, Amy Coney Barrett was nominated.\n\n\nSome historians contend that Cardozo – a Sephardic Jew believed to be of distant Portuguese descent[48] – should also be counted as the first Hispanic Justice.[1] Schmidhauser wrote in 1979 that \"among the large ethnic groupings of European origin which have never been represented upon the Supreme Court are the Italians, Southern Slavs, and Hispanic Americans.\"[20] The National Hispanic Center for Advanced Studies and Policy Analysis wrote in 1982 that the Supreme Court \"has never had an Hispanic Justice\",[49] and the *Hispanic American Almanac* similarly reported in 1996 that \"no Hispanic has yet sat on the U.S. Supreme Court\".[50] However, Segal and Spaeth state: \"Though it is often claimed that no Hispanics have served on the Court, it is not clear why Benjamin Cardozo, a Sephardic Jew of Spanish heritage, should not count.\" They identify a number of other sources that present conflicting views as to Cardozo's ethnicity, with one simply labeling him \"Iberian.\" In 2007, the *Dictionary of Latino Civil Rights History* also listed Cardozo as \"the first Hispanic named to the Supreme Court of the United States.\"[51]\n\n\nThe nomination of Sonia Sotomayor, widely described in media accounts as the first Hispanic nominee, drew more attention to the question of Cardozo's ethnicity.[42][43][52] Cardozo biographer Andrew Kaufman questioned the usage of the term \"hispanic\" during Cardozo's lifetime, commenting: \"Well, I think he regarded himself as Sephardic Jew whose ancestors came from the Iberian Peninsula.\"[42] However, \"no one has ever firmly established that the family's roots were, in fact, in Portugal\".[43] It has also been asserted that Cardozo himself \"confessed in 1937 that his family preserved neither the Spanish language nor Iberian cultural traditions\".[53] By contrast, Cardozo made his own translations of authoritative legal works written in French and German.[54]\n\n\n\n### Asian and other ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Asian American jurists\n\nAsian-American jurists are poorly represented at all levels of federal judicial system, let alone being Supreme Court justices. According to the Center for American Progress (2019),[55] among active federal judges serving on U.S. courts of appeals, only 10 were Asian Americans (5.7 percent). According to the study by the California Justice Goodwin Liu (2017), of the 94 U.S. attorneys, only three are Asian American; and only 4 of the 2,437 elected prosecutors are Asian American.[56][57] President Trump included Indian-American judge Amul Thapar on a list of potential nominees to the court,[58][59] and Thapar was reported to be one of several front-runners to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Anthony Kennedy.[60][61] Ultimately, Brett Kavanaugh was nominated.\n\n\n\n### Public opinion on ethnic diversity[edit]\n\n\nPublic opinion about ethnic diversity on the court \"varies widely depending on the poll question's wording\".[6] For example, in two polls taken in 1991, one resulted in half of respondents agreeing that it was \"important that there always be at least one black person\" on the court while the other had only 20 percent agreeing with that sentiment, and with 77 percent agreeing that \"race should never be a factor in choosing Supreme Court justices\".[6]\n\n\n\n## Gender[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sandra Day O'Connor, the first female justice, with President Ronald Reagan, who appointed her\n![](image)The first four women who served on the court. From left to right: Justices Sandra Day O'Connor (ret.), Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan. October 1, 2010, prior to Justice Kagan's investiture ceremony.\nOf the 116 justices, 110 (94.8 percent) have been men. All Supreme Court justices were males until 1981, when Ronald Reagan fulfilled his 1980 campaign promise to place a woman on the court,[62] which he did with the appointment of Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor was later joined on the court by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appointed by Bill Clinton in 1993. After O'Connor retired in 2006, Ginsburg was joined by Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who were successfully appointed to the court in 2009 and 2010, respectively, by Barack Obama.[63] In September 2020, following Ginsburg's death, Donald Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett to succeed her.[64] Barrett was confirmed the following month. Only one woman, Harriet Miers, has been nominated to the court unsuccessfully. Her nomination to succeed O'Connor by George W. Bush was withdrawn under fire from both parties, and also marked the first time when a woman was nominated to replace another woman on the court. The nomination of Barrett was the first successful nomination for a woman to succeed another woman. Joe Biden's 2022 nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to a seat vacated by the retirement of Stephen Breyer makes Jackson the first African-American woman to be nominated to the court.[30] The Senate confirmed Jackson on April 7, 2022.[31]\n\n\nSubstantial public sentiment in support of appointment of a woman to the Supreme Court has been expressed since at least as early as 1930, when an editorial in *The Christian Science Monitor* encouraged Herbert Hoover to consider Ohio justice Florence E. Allen or assistant attorney general Mabel Walker Willebrandt.[65] Franklin Delano Roosevelt later appointed Allen to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit—making her \"one of the highest ranking female jurists in the world at that time\".[66] However, neither Roosevelt nor his successors over the following two decades gave strong consideration to female candidates for the court. Harry Truman considered such an appointment but was dissuaded by concerns raised by justices then serving that a woman on the court \"would inhibit their conference deliberations\", which were marked by informality.[66]\n\n\nPresident Richard Nixon named Mildred Lillie, then serving on the Second District Court of Appeal of California, as a potential nominee to fill one of two vacancies on the court in 1971.[62] However, Lillie was quickly deemed unqualified by the American Bar Association, and no formal proceedings were ever set with respect to her potential nomination. Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist were then successfully nominated to fill those vacancies.\n\n\nIn 1991, a poll found that 53 percent of Americans felt it \"important that there always be at least one woman\" on the court.[6] However, when O'Connor stepped down from the court, leaving Justice Ginsburg as the lone remaining woman, only one in seven persons polled found it \"essential that a woman be nominated to replace\" O'Connor.[6]\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen on the Supreme Court\n| Name\n | Appointedfrom\n | Birth\n | Death\n | Yearappointed\n | Leftoffice\n | Appointed by\n | Reason fordeparture\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sandra Day O'Connor | Arizona | 1930 | *living* | 1981 | 2006 | Reagan | retirement\n |\n| Ruth Bader Ginsburg | New York | 1933 | 2020 | 1993 | 2020 | Clinton | death\n |\n| Sonia Sotomayor | New York | 1954 | *living* | 2009 | *incumbent* | Obama | —\n |\n| Elena Kagan | New York | 1960 | *living* | 2010 | *incumbent* | Obama | —\n |\n| Amy Coney Barrett | Indiana | 1972 | *living* | 2020 | *incumbent* | Trump | —\n |\n| Ketanji Brown Jackson | Washington, D.C. | 1970 | *living* | 2022 | *incumbent* | Biden | —\n |\n\n\nGraphical timeline of female justices:\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## Marital status and sexual orientation[edit]\n\n\n### Marital status[edit]\n\n\nAll but a handful of Supreme Court justices have been married. William H. Moody, Frank Murphy, Benjamin Cardozo, and James Clark McReynolds were all lifelong bachelors.[67] In addition, retired justice David Souter and current justice Elena Kagan have never been married.[68][69] William O. Douglas was the first Justice to divorce while on the court and also had the most marriages of any Justice, with four.[67] Justice John Paul Stevens divorced his first wife in 1979, marrying his second wife later that year. Sonia Sotomayor was the first female justice to be appointed as an unmarried woman, having divorced in 1983, long before her nomination in 2009.[67][69] Of the six women who have been appointed to the Court, O'Connor and Ginsburg were the only two military spouses,[70] both having accompanied their spouses to their service posts, though in both cases their spouses had served for only brief periods, decades prior to their appointments.\n\n\nSeveral justices have become widowers while on the bench. The 1792 death of Elizabeth Rutledge, wife of Justice John Rutledge, contributed to the mental health problems that led to the rejection of his recess appointment.[71] Roger B. Taney survived his wife, Anne, by twenty years. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. resolutely continued working on the court for several years after the death of his wife.[72] William Rehnquist was a widower for the last fourteen years of his service on the court, his wife Natalie having died on October 17, 1991, after suffering from ovarian cancer. With the death of Martin D. Ginsburg in June 2010, Ruth Bader Ginsburg became the first woman to be widowed while serving on the court.[73]\n\n\n\n### Sexual orientation[edit]\n\n\nWith regard to sexual orientation, no Supreme Court justice has identified themself as anything other than heterosexual, and no incontrovertible evidence of a justice having any other sexual orientation has ever been uncovered. However, the personal lives of several justices and nominees have attracted speculation.\n\n\nG. Harrold Carswell was unsuccessfully nominated by Richard Nixon in 1970 and was convicted in 1976 of battery for making an \"unnatural and lascivious\" advance to a male police officer working undercover in a Florida men's room.[74] Some therefore claim him as the only gay or bisexual person nominated to the court thus far.[75][76] If so, it is unlikely that Nixon was aware of it; White House Counsel John Dean later wrote of Carswell that \"[w]hile Richard Nixon was always looking for historical firsts, nominating a homosexual to the high court would not have been on his list\".[76]\n\n\nSpeculation has been recorded about the sexual orientation of a few justices who were lifelong bachelors, but no unambiguous evidence exists that they were gay. Perhaps the greatest body of circumstantial evidence surrounds Frank Murphy, who was dogged by \"rumors of homosexuality ... all his adult life\".[77]\n\n\n\n\n> For more than 40 years, Edward G. Kemp was Frank Murphy's devoted, trusted companion. Like Murphy, Kemp was a lifelong bachelor. From college until Murphy's death, the pair found creative ways to work and live together. [...] When Murphy appeared to have the better future in politics, Kemp stepped into a supportive, secondary role.[78]\n> \n> \n\n\nAs well as Murphy's close relationship with Kemp, Murphy's biographer, historian Sidney Fine, found in Murphy's personal papers a letter that \"if the words mean what they say, refers to a homosexual encounter some years earlier between Murphy and the writer.\" However, the letter's veracity cannot be confirmed, and a review of all the evidence led Fine to conclude that he \"could not stick his neck out and say [Murphy] was gay\".[79]\n\n\nSpeculation has also surrounded Benjamin Cardozo, whose celibacy was proposed to suggest repressed homosexuality or asexuality. The fact that he was unmarried and was personally tutored by the writer Horatio Alger (alleged to have had sexual relations with boys) led some of Cardozo's biographers to insinuate that Cardozo was homosexual, but no real evidence exists to corroborate this possibility. Constitutional law scholar Jeffrey Rosen noted in a *The New York Times Book Review* of Richard Polenberg's book on Cardozo:\n\n\n\n\n> Polenberg describes Cardozo's lifelong devotion to his older sister Nell, with whom he lived in New York until her death in 1929. When asked why he had never married, Cardozo replied, quietly and sadly, \"I never could give Nellie the second place in my life.\" Polenberg suggests that friends may have stressed Cardozo's devotion to his sister to discourage rumors \"that he was sexually dysfunctional, or had an unusually low sexual drive or was homosexual.\" But he produces no evidence to support any of these possibilities, except to note that friends, in describing Cardozo, used words like \"beautiful\", \"exquisite\", \"sensitive\" or \"delicate.\"[80]\n> \n> \n\n Andrew Kaufman, author of *Cardozo*, a biography published in 2000, notes that \"Although one cannot be absolutely certain, it seems highly likely that Cardozo lived a celibate life\".[81] Judge Learned Hand is quoted in the book as saying about Cardozo: \"He [had] no trace of homosexuality anyway\".[82]\n\n\nMore recently, when David Souter was nominated to the court, \"conservative groups expressed concern to the White House ... that the president's bachelor nominee might conceivably be a homosexual\".[83] Similar questions were raised regarding the sexual orientation of unmarried nominee Elena Kagan.[84] However, no evidence was ever produced regarding Souter's sexual orientation, and Kagan's apparent heterosexuality was attested by colleagues familiar with her dating history.[85]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nWhen the Supreme Court was established in 1789, the first members came from among the ranks of the Founding Fathers and were almost uniformly Protestant. Of the 116 justices who have been appointed to the court, 92 have been from various Protestant denominations, 15 have been Catholics (one other justice, Sherman Minton, converted to Catholicism after leaving the court). Another, Neil Gorsuch, was raised in the Catholic Church but later attended an Episcopal church, though without specifying the denomination to which he felt he belonged.[86] Eight have been Jewish and one, David Davis, had no known religious affiliation.[87] Three of the 17 chief justices have been Catholics, and one Jewish justice, Abe Fortas, was unsuccessfully nominated to be chief justice.\n\n\nThe table below shows the religious affiliation of each of the justices sitting as of July 2022[update]:\n\n\n\n\n\nReligious makeup of the current court\n| Name\n | Religion\n | Appt. by\n | On the court since\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| John Roberts (Chief Justice)\n | Catholicism\n | G. W. Bush | 2005\n |\n| Clarence Thomas | Catholicism\n | G. H. W.

These have included 33 Episcopalians, 18 Presbyterians, nine Unitarians, five Methodists, three Baptists, two Disciples of Christ, and lone representatives of various other denominations.[89] William Rehnquist and William R. Day were the court's only Lutherans. Noah Swayne was a Quaker. Some fifteen Protestant justices did not adhere to a particular denomination. The religious beliefs of James Wilson, one of the earliest justices, have been the subject of some dispute, as there are writings from various points of his life from which it can be argued that he leaned towards Presbyterianism, Anglicanism, Thomism, or Deism; it has been deemed likely that he eventually favored some form of Christianity.[90] Baptist denominations and other evangelical churches have been underrepresented on the court relative to the population of the United States, and entirely unrepresented since the retirement of Methodist Harry Blackmun in 1994.[89] Conversely, mainline Protestant churches historically were overrepresented.[19]\n\n\nFollowing the retirement of John Paul Stevens in June 2010, the court had an entirely non-Protestant composition for the first time in its history.[91][92] Neil Gorsuch was the first member of a mainline Protestant denomination to sit on the court since Stevens' retirement.[93][h] Ketanji Brown Jackson is a non-denominational Protestant.[98][99]: 1:49:39\n\n\n\n### Catholic justices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Roger B. Taney, the first Catholic Justice\nThe first Catholic justice, Roger B. Taney, was appointed chief justice in 1836 by Andrew Jackson. The second, Edward Douglass White, was appointed as an associate justice in 1894, but also went on to become chief justice. Joseph McKenna was appointed in 1898, placing two Catholics on the court until White's death in 1921. This period marked the beginning of an inconsistently observed \"tradition\" of having a \"Catholic seat\" on the court.[100]\n\n\nOther Catholic justices included Pierce Butler (appointed 1923) and Frank Murphy (appointed 1940). Sherman Minton, appointed in 1949, was a Protestant during his time on the court. To some, however, his wife's Catholic faith implied a \"Catholic seat\".[101] Minton joined his wife's church in 1961, five years after he retired from the court.[102] Minton was succeeded by a Catholic, however, when President Eisenhower appointed William J. Brennan to that seat. Eisenhower sought a Catholic to appoint to the court—in part because there had been no Catholic justice since Murphy's death in 1949, and in part because Eisenhower was directly lobbied by Francis Cardinal Spellman of the Archdiocese of New York to make such an appointment.[103] Brennan was then the lone Catholic justice until the appointment of Antonin Scalia in 1986, and Anthony Kennedy in 1988.\n\n\nLike Sherman Minton, Clarence Thomas was not a Catholic at the time he was appointed to the court. Thomas was raised Catholic and briefly attended Conception Seminary College, a Catholic seminary,[104] but had joined the Protestant denomination of his wife after their marriage. At some point in the late 1990s, Thomas returned to Catholicism. In 2005, John Roberts became the third Catholic Chief Justice and the fourth Catholic on the court. Shortly thereafter, Samuel Alito became the fifth on the court, and the eleventh in the history of the court. Alito's appointment gave the court a Catholic majority for the first time in its history. Besides Thomas, at least one other Justice, James F. Byrnes, was raised as a Catholic, but converted to a different branch of Christianity prior to serving on the court.\n\n\nIn contrast to historical patterns, the court has gone from having a \"Catholic seat\" to being what some have characterized as a \"Catholic court\". The reasons for that are subject to debate.[105] The fact that most recent Catholic appointees were also ideologically conservative has led some partisan critics to derisively refer to the court as \"a Catholic boys club\".[106] However in May 2009, President Barack Obama nominated a Catholic woman, Sonia Sotomayor, to replace retiring Justice David Souter.[107] Her confirmation raised the number of Catholics on the court to six, compared to three non-Catholics. With Antonin Scalia's death in February 2016, the number of Catholic justices went back to five. Scalia's replacement, Neil Gorsuch, appointed in 2017, was raised Catholic but attends and is a member of an Episcopal church; it is unclear if he identifies as a Catholic as well as belonging to the Episcopal Church.[86] Following Anthony Kennedy's retirement in July 2018, the number of Catholic justices remained unchanged as he was succeeded by Catholic Brett Kavanaugh. In September 2020, following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Donald Trump nominated another Catholic, Amy Coney Barrett to succeed her.[64]\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic justices\n| Name\n | Appointedfrom\n | Birth\n | Death\n | Yearappointed\n | Leftoffice\n | Appointed by\n | Reason fortermination\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roger B.

Benjamin to be the first Jewish justice, and *The New York Times* reported (on February 15, 1853) that \"if the President nominates Benjamin, the Democrats are determined to confirm him\". However, Benjamin declined the offer, and ultimately became Secretary of State for the Confederacy during the Civil War. The first Jewish nominee, Louis Brandeis, was appointed in 1916, after a tumultuous hearing process. The 1932 appointment of Benjamin Cardozo raised mild controversy for placing two Jewish justices on the court at the same time, although the appointment was widely lauded based on Cardozo's qualifications, and the Senate was unanimous in confirming Cardozo.[108] Most Jewish Supreme Court justices were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, with the exception of Cardozo, who was Sephardic. None of the Jewish Supreme Court justices have practiced Orthodox Judaism while on the court, although Abe Fortas was raised Orthodox.[109]\n\n\nCardozo was succeeded by another Jewish justice, Felix Frankfurter, but Brandeis was succeeded by Protestant William O. Douglas. Negative reaction to the appointment of the early Jewish justices did not exclusively come from outside the court. Justice James Clark McReynolds, a blatant anti-semite, refused to speak to Brandeis for three years following the latter's appointment and when Brandeis retired in 1939, did not sign the customary dedicatory letter sent to court members on their retirement. During Benjamin Cardozo's swearing in ceremony McReynolds pointedly read a newspaper muttering \"another one\" and did not attend that of Felix Frankfurter, exclaiming \"My God, another Jew on the Court!\"[110]\n\n\nFrankfurter was followed by Arthur Goldberg and Abe Fortas, each of whom filled what became known as the \"Jewish seat\".[111] After Fortas resigned in 1969, he was replaced by Protestant Harry Blackmun. No Jewish justices were nominated thereafter until Ronald Reagan nominated Douglas H. Ginsburg in 1987, to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Lewis F. Powell; however, this nomination was withdrawn, and the court remained without any Jewish justices until 1993, when Ruth Bader Ginsburg (unrelated to Douglas Ginsburg) was appointed to replace Byron White. Ginsburg was followed in relatively quick succession by the appointment of Stephen Breyer, also Jewish, in 1994 to replace Harry Blackmun. In 2010, the confirmation of President Barack Obama's nomination of Elena Kagan to the court created the possibility that three Jewish justices would serve simultaneously. Prior to this confirmation, conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan stated that, \"If Kagan is confirmed, Jews, who represent less than 2 percent of the U.S. population, will have 33 percent of the Supreme Court seats\".[112] At the time of his remarks, 6.4 percent of justices in the history of the court had been Jewish. Justice Ginsburg's death in 2020 and Breyer's retirement in 2022 reduced the number to one.\n\n\n\n\n\nJewish justices\n| Name\n | Appointedfrom\n | Birth\n | Death\n | Yearappointed\n | Leftoffice\n | Appointed by\n | Reason fordeparture\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Louis Brandeis | Kentucky | 1856 | 1941 | 1916 | 1939 | Wilson | retirement\n |\n| Benjamin N.

Clarence Thomas, who had been raised as a Catholic but had attended an Episcopal church after his marriage, returned to Catholicism later in the 1990s. At this point, the four remaining Protestant justices—Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, and Souter—remained a plurality on the court, but for the first time in the history of the court, Protestants were no longer an absolute majority.\n\n\nThe first Catholic plurality on the court occurred in 2005, when Chief Justice Rehnquist was succeeded in office by Chief Justice John Roberts, who became the fourth sitting Catholic justice. On January 31, 2006, Samuel Alito became the fifth sitting Catholic justice, and on August 6, 2009, Sonia Sotomayor became the sixth. By contrast, there have only been two Catholic U.S. Presidents, John F. Kennedy (unrelated to Justice Kennedy) and Joe Biden, who was previously the only Catholic to serve as Vice President. There has never been a Jewish U.S. President or Vice President.\n\n\nAt the beginning of 2010, Justice John Paul Stevens was the sole remaining Protestant on the court.[107][113] In April 2010, Justice Stevens announced his retirement, effective as of the court's 2010 summer recess. Upon Justice Stevens' retirement, which formally began on June 28, 2010, the court lacked a Protestant member, marking the first time in its history that it was exclusively composed of Jewish and Catholic justices.[91] Although in January 2017, after seven years with no Protestant justices serving or nominated, President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the court, as noted above it is unclear whether Gorsuch considers himself a Catholic or an Episcopalian.[114][86] Following the retirement of Justice Kennedy, the Catholic majority on the court was extended by the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh;[115] the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett increased this majority to six Catholic members of the court, or seven if Gorsuch is classified as a Catholic.[86]\n\n\nThis development led to some comment. Law school professor Jeffrey Rosen wrote that \"it's a fascinating truth that we've allowed religion to drop out of consideration on the Supreme Court, and right now, we have a Supreme Court that religiously at least, by no means looks like America\".[116]\n\n\n\n### Unrepresented religions[edit]\n\n\nA number of sizable religious groups, each less than two percent of the total U.S. population,[117] have had no members appointed as justices. These include Orthodox Christians, Mormons, Pentecostals, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and members of Native American religions. George Sutherland has been described as a \"lapsed Mormon\"[118] because he was raised in the LDS Church, his parents having immigrated to the United States during Sutherland's infancy to join that church.[119] Sutherland's parents soon left the LDS Church and moved to Montana.[119] Sutherland himself also disaffiliated with the faith, but remained in Utah and graduated from Brigham Young Academy in 1881, the only non-Mormon in his class.[120] In 1975, Attorney General Edward H. Levi had listed Dallin H. Oaks, a Mormon who had clerked for Earl Warren and was then president of Brigham Young University, as a potential nominee for Gerald Ford. Ford \"crossed Oaks's name off the list early on, noting in the margin that a member of the LDS Church might bring a 'confirmation fight'\".[121]\n\n\nNo professing atheist has ever been appointed to the court, although some justices have declined to engage in religious activity, or affiliate with a denomination. As an adult, Benjamin Cardozo no longer practiced his faith and identified himself as an agnostic, though he remained proud of his Jewish heritage.[122]\n\n\n\n## Age[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the oldest justice in history, served on the court until he was 90.\nUnlike the offices of President, U.S. Representative, and U.S. Senator, there is no minimum age for Supreme Court justices set forth in the United States Constitution. However, justices tend to be appointed after having made significant achievements in law or politics, which excludes many young potential candidates from consideration. At the same time, justices appointed at too advanced an age will likely have short tenures on the court.\n\n\nThe youngest justice ever appointed was Joseph Story, 32 at the time of his appointment in 1812; the oldest was Charles Evans Hughes, who was 67 at the time of his appointment as Chief Justice in 1930. (Hughes had previously been appointed to the court as an associate justice in 1910, at the age of 48, but had resigned in 1916 to run for president). Story went on to serve for 33 years, while Hughes served 11 years after his second appointment. The oldest justice at the time of his initial appointment was Horace Lurton, 65 at the time of his appointment in 1909. Lurton died after only four years on the court. The oldest sitting justice to be elevated to Chief Justice was Hughes' successor, Harlan Fiske Stone, who was 68 at the time of his elevation in 1941. Stone died in 1946, only five years after his elevation. The oldest nominee to the court was South Carolina senator William Smith, nominated in 1837, then aged around 75 (it is known that he was born in 1762, but not the exact date). The Senate confirmed Smith's nomination by a vote of 23–18, but Smith declined to serve.[123] Smith died three years later.\n\n\nOf the justices sitting as of June 13, 2024, Amy Coney Barrett is the youngest, at 52 years, 137 days old, while Clarence Thomas is the oldest at 75 years, 356 days. The oldest person to have served on the court was Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who stepped down two months shy of his 91st birthday.[124] John Paul Stevens, second only to Holmes,[124] left the court in June 2010, two months after turning 90.\n\n\n\n![](image)Joseph Story was only 32 when he became a justice of the court.\nThe average age of the court as a whole fluctuates over time with the departure of older justices and the appointment of younger people to fill their seats. As of 2022[update], the youngest sitting Justice at the time of appointment is Clarence Thomas, who was 43 years old at the time of his confirmation in 1991. Following the appointment of Ketanji Brown Jackson, the average age of the court is between 61 and 62 years old. By contrast, just prior to the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist in September 2005, the average age was 71. After Jackson's appointment and confirmation in 2022, the average age of appointment for current justices is between 50 and 51 years old.\n\n\nThe longest period of time in which one group of justices has served together occurred from August 3, 1994, when Stephen Breyer was appointed to replace the retired Harry Blackmun, to September 3, 2005, the death of Rehnquist, totaling 11 years and 31 days. From 1789 until 1970, justices served an average of 14.9 years. Those who have stepped down since 1970 have served an average of 25.6 years. The retirement age had jumped from an average of 68 pre-1970 to 79 for justices retiring post-1970. Between 1789 and 1970 there was a vacancy on the court once every 1.91 years. In the next 34 years since the two appointments in 1971, there was a vacancy on average only once every 3.75 years. The typical one-term president has had one appointment opportunity instead of two.[125]\n\n\nCommentators have noted that advances in medical knowledge \"have enormously increased the life expectancy of a mature person of an age likely to be considered for appointment to the Supreme Court\".[126] Combined with the reduction in responsibilities carried out by modern justices as compared to the early justices, this results in much longer potential terms of service.[126] This has led to proposals such as imposing a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices,[127] or predetermined term limits.[128]\n\n\n\n## Educational background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of law schools attended by United States Supreme Court justices\n\n![](image)Stanley F. Reed was the last sitting justice to have not graduated from law school.\nAlthough the Constitution imposes no educational background requirements for federal judges, the work of the court involves complex questions of law—ranging from constitutional law to administrative law to admiralty law—and consequently, a legal education has become a *de facto* prerequisite to appointment on the Supreme Court. Every person who has been nominated to the court has been an attorney.[7]\n\n\nBefore the advent of modern law schools in the United States, justices, like most attorneys of the time, completed their legal studies by \"reading law\" (studying under and acting as an apprentice to more experienced attorneys) rather than attending a formal program. The first justice to be appointed who had attended an actual law school was Levi Woodbury, appointed to the court in 1846. Woodbury had attended Tapping Reeve Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut, prior to his admission to the bar in 1812. However, Woodbury did not receive a law degree. Woodbury's successor on the court, Benjamin Robbins Curtis, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1832, and was appointed to the court in 1851, was the first justice to bear such a credential.[129]\n\n\nAssociate justices James F. Byrnes, whose short tenure lasted from June 1941 to October 1942, and Robert H. Jackson, who served from July 1941 to October 1954, were the last two justices to be appointed without having graduated from law school; Stanley Forman Reed, who served on the court from 1938 to 1957, was the last sitting justice from such a background. In total, of the 115 justices appointed to the court, 49 have graduated from law school, an additional 18 attended some law school but did not graduate, and 47 received their legal education without any law school attendance.[129] Two justices, Sherman Minton and Lewis F. Powell Jr., earned a Master of Laws degree.[130] Of those who attended law school, 40 attended one of three specific institutions: Harvard Law School, Yale Law School, and Columbia Law School. Furthermore, an overwhelming majority of law school attendees appointed to the court attended a private law school rather than a public law school.\n\n\nIn 1970, G. Harrold Carswell, was nominated as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court – to occupy the seat vacated by Abe Fortas. During the debate of the nomination, Nebraska Republican Roman Hruska intoned in a TV interview, \"Even if he [Carswell] were mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a little representation, aren't they? We can't have all Brandeises and Frankfurters and Cardozos.\"[131]\n\n\nThe table below shows the college and law school from which each of the currently sitting justices graduated:\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic history of the current court\n| Name\n | Appt. by\n | College\n | Law school\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| John Roberts (Chief Justice)\n | G. W. Bush | Harvard | Harvard |\n| Clarence Thomas | G. H. W.

Few justices have a background as criminal defense lawyers, and Thurgood Marshall is reportedly the last justice to have had a client in a death penalty case.[132]\n\n\nHistorically, justices have come from some tradition of public service; only George Shiras Jr. had no such experience.[133] Relatively few justices have been appointed from among members of Congress. Six were members of the United States Senate at the time of their appointment,[134][135] while one was a sitting member of the House of Representatives.[136] Six more had previously served in the Senate. Three have been sitting governors.[134][137] Only one, William Howard Taft, had been President of the United States.[138] The last justice to have held elected office was Sandra Day O'Connor, who was elected twice to the Arizona State Senate after being appointed there by the governor.\n\n\nPredominantly, recent justices have had experience in the Executive branch. The last Member of Congress to be nominated was Sherman Minton. The last nominee to have any Legislative branch experience was Sandra Day O'Connor.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], 42 justices have been military veterans.[139] Numerous justices were appointed who had served in the American Revolutionary War, the American Civil War (including three who had served in the Confederate States Army), World War I and World War II. However, no justice has been appointed who has served in any subsequent war. The last justice to have served in the military during wartime was John Paul Stevens, who was in naval intelligence during World War II.[140]\n\n\n\n## Financial means[edit]\n\n\nThe financial position of the typical Supreme Court Justice has been described as \"upper-middle to high social status: reared in nonrural but not necessarily urban environment, member of a civic-minded, politically active, economically comfortable family\".[129] Charles A. Beard, in his *An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States*, profiled those among the justices who were also drafters of the Constitution.\n\n\nJames Wilson, Beard notes, \"developed a lucrative practice at Carlisle\" before becoming \"one of the directors of the Bank of North America on its incorporation in 1781\".[141] A member of the Georgia Land Company, Wilson \"held shares to the amount of at least one million acres\".[142] John Blair was \"one of the most respectable men in Virginia, both on account of his Family as well as fortune\".[143] Another source notes that Blair \"was a member of a prominent Virginia family. His father served on the Virginia Council and was for a time acting Royal governor. His granduncle, James Blair, was founder and first president of the College of William and Mary.\"[144] John Rutledge was elected Governor of South Carolina at a time when the Constitution of that state set, as a qualification for the office, ownership of \"a settled plantation or freehold ... of the value of at least ten thousand pounds currency, clear of debt\".[145] Oliver Ellsworth \"rose rapidly to wealth and power in the bar of his native state\" with \"earnings... unrivalled in his own day and unexampled in the history of the colony\", developing \"a fortune which for the times and the country was quite uncommonly large\".[146] Bushrod Washington was the nephew of George Washington, who was at the time of the younger Washington's appointment the immediate past President of the United States and one of the wealthiest men in the country.[147]\n\n\n\"About three-fifths of those named to the Supreme Court personally knew the President who nominated them\".[103] There have been exceptions to the typical portrait of justices growing up middle class or wealthy. For example, the family of Sherman Minton went through a period of impoverishment during his childhood, resulting from the disability of his father due to a heat stroke.[148]\n\n\nIn 2008, seven of the nine sitting justices were millionaires, and the remaining two were close to that level of wealth.[149] Historian Howard Zinn, in his 1980 book *A People's History of the United States*, argues that the justices cannot be neutral in matters between rich and poor, as they are almost always from the upper class.[150] Chief Justice Roberts is the son of an executive with Bethlehem Steel; Justice Stevens was born into a wealthy Chicago family;[151] and Justices Kennedy and Breyer both had fathers who were successful attorneys. Justices Alito and Scalia both had educated (and education-minded) parents: Scalia's father was a highly educated college professor and Alito's father was a high school teacher before becoming \"a long-time employee of the New Jersey state legislature\".[152] Only Justices Thomas and Sotomayor have been regarded as coming from a lower-class background. One authority states that \"Thomas grew up in poverty. The Pin Point community he lived in lacked a sewage system and paved roads. Its inhabitants dwelled in destitution and earned but a few cents each day performing manual labor\".[153] The depth of Thomas's poverty has been disputed by suggestions of \"ample evidence to suggest that Thomas enjoyed, by and large, a middle-class upbringing\".[154]\n\n\n\n### Financial disclosures[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1979, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 required federal officials, including the justices, to file annual disclosures of their income and assets.[155] These disclosures provide a snapshot into the wealth of the justices, reported within broad ranges, from year to year since 1979. In the first such set of disclosures, only two justices were revealed to be millionaires: Potter Stewart[156] and Lewis F. Powell,[157] with Chief Justice Warren Burger coming in third with about $600,000 in holdings.[156] The least wealthy Justice was Thurgood Marshall.[156]\n\n\nThe 1982 report disclosed that newly appointed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was a millionaire, and the second-wealthiest Justice on the court (after Powell).[158] The remaining justices listed assets in the range of tens of thousands to a few hundred-thousand, with the exception of Thurgood Marshall, who \"reported no assets or investment income of more than $100\".[158] The 1985 report had the justices in relatively the same positions,[159] while the 1992 report had O'Connor as the wealthiest member of the court, with Stevens being the only other millionaire, most other justices reporting assets averaging around a half million dollars, and the two newest justices, Clarence Thomas and David Souter, reporting assets of at least $65,000.[160] In 2011, however, it was revealed that Thomas had misstated his income going back to at least 1989.[161][162][163]\n\n\nThe 2007 report was the first to reflect the holdings of John Roberts and Samuel Alito. Disclosures for that year indicated that Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy were the only justices who were clearly not millionaires, although Thomas was reported to have signed a book deal worth over one million dollars.[164] Other justices have reported holdings within the following ranges:[165][166]\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal wealth of selected recent justices\n| Justice\n | Lowest range\n | Highest range\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| John Roberts\n | $2,400,000 | $6,200,000\n |\n| John Paul Stevens\n | $1,100,000 | $3,500,000\n |\n| Anthony Kennedy\n | $365,000 | $765,000\n |\n| David Souter\n | ? | ?\n |\n| Clarence Thomas\n | $150,000 | $410,000\n |\n| Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n | $5,000,000 | $25,000,000\n |\n| Stephen Breyer\n | $4,900,000 | $16,800,000\n |\n| Samuel Alito\n | $770,000 | $2,000,000\n |\n| Neil Gorsuch\n | $3,200,000 | $7,300,000\n |\n\n\nThe financial disclosures indicate that many of the justices have substantial stock holdings.[164] This, in turn, has affected the business of the court, as these holdings have led justices to recuse themselves from cases, occasionally with substantial impact. For example, in 2008, the recusal of John Roberts in one case, and Samuel Alito in another, resulted in each ending in a 4–4 split, which does not create a binding precedent.[167] The court was unable to decide another case in 2008 because four of the nine justices had conflicts, three arising from stock ownership in affected companies.[168]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Ideological leanings of United States Supreme Court justices\n* List of U.S. Supreme Court justices who also served in the U.S. Congress\n* List of law schools attended by United States Supreme Court justices\n* List of justices of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** David J. Brewer from Kansas; Byron White and Neil Gorsuch from Colorado; Willis Van Devanter from Wyoming; George Sutherland from Utah and Sandra Day O'Connor and William Rehnquist from Arizona\n2. **^** President Nixon reportedly intended to nominate Herschel Friday of Arkansas to a seat on the court, but changed his mind hours before announcing a different nominee.[15]\n3. **^** An unsuccessful nominee, G. Harrold Carswell, was from Florida. A successful nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, was born in Washington, D.C., and appointed from there, but spent a substantial portion of her life in Florida.\n4. **^** An unsuccessful nominee, George Henry Williams, was from Oregon.\n5. **^** West Virginia could be argued to have produced no Supreme Court justices back to the inaugural Court – it was part of Virginia between 1788 and 1863, and none of Virginia's five antebellum Supreme Court justices hailed from what became West Virginia.\n6. **^** Barack Obama considered appointing Sidney R. Thomas, a Federal judge from Montana, to the Supreme Court in 2010\n7. **^** According to the Social Security Administration Popular baby name database, Thurgood has never been in the top 1,000 of male baby names.\n8. **^** Although Neil Gorsuch, appointed in 2017, attends and is a member of an Episcopal church, he was raised Catholic and some of his acquaintances were unsure if he considered himself a Catholic who is also a member of a Protestant church, or simply a Protestant.[86] However, at his 2017 confirmation hearing, when asked a question about his faith, Gorsuch responded, \"I attend an Episcopal church in Boulder with my family, Senator.\"[94][95] Prior to his appointment he was an active member of Holy Comforter Episcopal Church and then St. John's Episcopal Church in Boulder, Colorado.[96][97]\n9. **^** This individual was elevated from associate justice to chief justice. Unlike the inferior courts, the chief justice is separately nominated and subject to a separate confirmation process, regardless of whether or not they are already an Associate Justice.\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** There are two types of retirement. First, a justice can resign an appointment in return for a pension, and the \"Reason Appointment Terminated\" is marked as \"retirement\". Alternatively, a justice can retire and assume senior status. The justice's appointment does not end; instead, the justice accepts a reduced workload on an inferior court. For instance, Stanley Forman Reed was frequently assigned to the Court of Claims when he was in senior status. As of 2006[update], every justice except Charles Evans Whittaker who assumed senior status has died in it; in that case, the judge will have the \"Reason Appointment Terminated\" as \"death\", even though the justice retired from the court before they died.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Segal and Spaeth (2002). *The Supreme Court and the Attitudinal Model Revisited*. p. 183.`{{cite book}}`: CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list (link)\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** O'Brien (2003). *Storm Center*. p. 46.`{{cite book}}`: CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list (link)\n3. **^** O'Brien (2003). *Storm Center*. p. 54.`{{cite book}}`: CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list (link)\n4. **^** John P.

The family into which Benjamin Nathan Cardozo was born ... was a Sephardic family, descended from those Jews who had fled from the Iberian peninsula during the Inquisition and had come to America via the Netherlands and England. Both branches of the family (the Cardozos and the Nathans) had arrived in the American colonies before the American Revolution. Cardozo family tradition holds that their ancestors were Portuguese Marranos—Jews who practiced Judaism secretly after forced conversion to Christianity—who fled the Inquisition in the seventeenth century. They took refuge first in Holland and then in London. Later members of the family emigrated to the New World. Aaron Cardozo, was the first Cardozo to settle in the American colonies, arriving in New York from London in 1752.\n22. **^** Biskupic, Joan (November 10, 2009). *American Original: The Life and Constitution of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia*.

He was nominated by President George H. W. Bush to succeed Thurgood Marshall and has served since 1991. After Marshall, Thomas is the second African American to serve on the Supreme Court and has been its longest-serving member since Anthony Kennedy's retirement in 2018. Since Stephen Breyer's retirement in 2022, he is also the Court's oldest member.\n\n\nThomas was born in Pin Point, Georgia. After his father abandoned the family, he was raised by his grandfather in a poor Gullah community near Savannah. Growing up as a devout Catholic, Thomas originally intended to be a priest in the Catholic Church but was frustrated over the church's insufficient attempts to combat racism. He abandoned his aspiration of becoming a clergyman to attend the College of the Holy Cross and, later Yale Law School, where he was influenced by a number of conservative authors, notably Thomas Sowell. Upon graduating, he was appointed as an assistant attorney general in Missouri and later entered private practice there. He became a legislative assistant to U.S. Senator John Danforth in 1979, and was made Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education in 1981. President Ronald Reagan appointed Thomas as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) the next year.\n\n\nPresident George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990. He served in that role for 19 months before filling Marshall's seat on the Supreme Court. Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed Anita Hill, a subordinate at the Department of Education and the EEOC.[5] Hill alleged that Thomas made multiple sexual and romantic overtures to her despite her repeatedly telling him to stop. Thomas and his supporters denied the allegation, asserting that Hill and her political supporters had fabricated the accusation to prevent the appointment of a black conservative. The Senate confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48, the narrowest margin in a century.[6]\n\n\nSince the death of Antonin Scalia, Thomas has been the Court's foremost originalist, stressing the original meaning in interpreting the Constitution.[7] In contrast to Scalia—who had been the only other consistent originalist—he pursues a more classically liberal variety of originalism.[8] Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments,[9] though has since begun asking more questions to counsel.[10] He is notable for his majority opinions in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School* (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment) and *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in *Gonzales v. Raich* (arguing that Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical marijuana). He is widely considered the Court's most conservative member.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nThomas was born on June 23, 1948, in his parents' wooden shack in Pin Point, Georgia.[11][12] Pin Point was a small community near Savannah founded by freedmen in the 1880s.[13] He was the second of three children of M. C. Thomas, a farm worker, and Leola Williams,[11] Myers Anderson's illegitimate daughter who, after her mother's death, had been sent from Liberty County, Georgia to live with an aunt in Pin Point.[14][15][16] His older sister Emma was born in 1946, his younger brother Myers in 1949.[17]\n\n\nThe family were descendants of enslaved people and spoke Gullah as a first language.[18] Thomas's earliest known ancestors were slaves named Sandy and Peggy, who were born in the late 18th century and owned by wealthy planter Josiah Wilson of Liberty County.[19]\n\n\n\nWhen Leola was pregnant with Thomas's older sister, she was expelled from her Baptist church and dropped out of high school after the 10th grade. Her father ordered her to marry M. C. in January 1947. They divorced in 1951.[17] M.C. moved to Savannah and later to Pennsylvania, visiting his children only once after the divorce. Custody of the children was awarded to Leola's aunt. Leola went to work as a maid in Savannah during the week, returning to Pin Point on the weekends. When the aunt's house burnt down in 1955, Leola took the boys to live with her in the room she rented in a tenement with an outdoor toilet in Savannah, leaving her daughter with the aunt in Pin Point.[20][21][22] Finding herself unable to raise two little boys by herself,[23] and unable to get public assistance because her father was wealthy,[22] she asked her father for help. He initially refused but agreed after his wife threatened to throw him out.[24][23]\n\n![](image)Thomas's 1967 high school yearbook pictureThomas and his brother went to live with Anderson and his wife in 1955 and experienced amenities such as indoor plumbing and regular meals for the first time.[25] Despite having little formal education, Anderson had built a successful business delivering coal, oil, and ice.[24] He converted to Catholicism, and sent Thomas to be educated at a series of segregated Catholic schools. Thomas attended the predominantly black St. Pius X High School in Chatham County[26] for two years before transferring to St. John Vianney's Minor Seminary on the Isle of Hope, where he was the segregated boarding school's first black student.[27][28] Though he experienced hazing, he performed well academically.[15] He spent many hours at the Carnegie Library, the only library for blacks in Savannah before libraries were desegregated in 1961.[29][30][32]\n\n\nWhen racial unrest led to widespread protest and marches in Savannah from 1960 to 1963, Anderson used his wealth to bail out demonstrators and took his grandchildren to meetings promoted by the NAACP.[33]\n\n\nWhen Thomas was ten years old, Anderson began putting his grandsons to work during the summers, helping him build a house on a plot of farmland he owned, building fences, and doing farm work.[34] He believed in hard work and self-reliance,[35] never showed his grandsons affection,[34] beat them frequently according to Leola, and impressed the importance of a good education on them.[36] Anderson taught Thomas that \"all of our rights as human beings came from God, not man\", and that racial segregation was a violation of divine law.[37]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nDuring his freshman year from 1967 to 1968, Thomas attended Conception Seminary College, a Catholic seminary in Missouri, with the intent to become a priest; no one in Thomas's family had attended college before.[38][27] After Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, he overheard a student say, \"Good. I hope the S.O.B. dies\" and \"[t]hat's what they should do to all the niggers\".[39][40][41] Thomas thought the church did not do enough to combat racism and resolved to abandon the priesthood.[42][39] He left the seminary at the end of the semester.[39]\n\n\nAt a nun's suggestion, Thomas enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross, an elite Catholic college in Massachusetts, as a sophomore transfer student on a full academic scholarship.[43][44] He was one of the college's first black students, being one of 20 recruited by President John E. Brooks in 1968 in a group that also included future attorney Ted Wells, running back Eddie Jenkins, Jr., and novelist Edward P. Jones.[45] Without financial support from his grandfather, Thomas defrayed his expenses by working as a waiter and dishwasher in the college's dining hall.[46][47] He later recalled, \"I was 19. My only hope was Holy Cross College\".[48]\n\n\n\nProfessors at Holy Cross remembered Thomas as a determined, diligent student. He kept to a strict routine of studying alone and stayed back during holidays to continue working.[49] Thomas C. Lawler, an English professor at Holy Cross,[50] recalled him as having \"never talked very much in class. He was the kind of person you really might not notice\".[51] By contrast, he was outspoken at BSU meetings, distinguishing himself as a contrarian who often feuded with Ted Wells. Future NFL running back Ed Jenkins, a BSU member, said Thomas \"could turn on a dime and reduce you to intellectual rubble\".[52][53] Edward P. Jones, who lived across from Thomas as a sophomore, reflected that \"there was a fierce determination I sensed from him [Thomas], that he was going to get as much as he could and get as far, ultimately, as he could\".[54] \n\n![](image)Dinand Library at the College of the Holy Cross, where Thomas studied for college[55]\nThomas became a vocal student activist as an undergraduate. He became acquainted with Black separatism, the Black Muslim Movement, the Black power movement, helped draft the Black Student Union (BSU), and displayed a poster of Malcolm X in his dormitory room.[56] When some black students were disproportionately punished in comparison with white students for the same violation, he suggested a walkout in protest. The BSU adopted his idea, and Thomas, along with 60 other black students, departed campus.[57][58] Some of the priests negotiated with the protesting black students to reenter the school.[27] When administrators granted amnesty to all protesters, Thomas returned to the college, later also to attend anti-war marches. In April 1970, he participated in the violent 1970 Harvard Square riots.[59] He has credited his protests for his turn toward conservatism and subsequent disillusionment with leftist movements.[60][61][54]\n\n\nHaving struggled with English as a native speaker of Gullah, Thomas chose to major in English literature.[46][62] He became a member of Alpha Sigma Nu, the Jesuit honor society, and the Purple Key Society, of which he was the only black member.[63] The college's focus on a liberal arts education introduced him to the works of black intellectuals such as Richard Wright, whose literary works Thomas sympathized with.[64] He also admired Malcolm X and recalled reading *The Autobiography of Malcolm X* to the point of wearing down the pages of his copy.[65]\n\n\nThomas graduated on June 4, 1971, with a Bachelor of Arts, *cum laude*,[63] ranked ninth in his class.[66][67] In his junior year, he was named a Fenwick Scholar, one of the highest honors at Holy Cross; in his senior year, he decided to pursue a career in law. Due to his academic achievements, he applied to and was accepted at Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[66][68] In 1971, Thomas matriculated at Yale Law School as one of 12 black students.[69] Yale offered him the best financial aid package, and he was attracted to the civil rights activism of some of its faculty members.[70][71] Finding it difficult to keep up with the school's expectations, he struggled to connect with other students who came from upper-class backgrounds. He enrolled in the most difficult courses and became a student of property law scholar Quintin Johnstone, who became his favorite professor.[72][73] Johnstone remembered Thomas as having \"performed very well\" and Dean Guido Calabresi described him and fellow student Hillary Clinton as \"both excellent students [who] had the same kind of reputation\".[74] He received several student deferments from the military draft with the classification 1-A after graduation, but failed the medical exam due to the curvature of his spine.[75]\n\n\nThomas obtained his Juris Doctor on May 20, 1974.[76] After graduation, he sought to enter private practice as a corporate lawyer in Atlanta, Georgia.[77] He has said that the law firms he applied to did not take his degree seriously, assuming he obtained it because of affirmative action.[78] According to Thomas, the law firms also \"asked pointed questions, unsubtly suggesting that they doubted I was as smart as my grades indicated\".[79] In his 2007 memoir, he wrote: \"I peeled a fifteen-cent sticker off a package of cigars and stuck it on the frame of my law degree to remind myself of the mistake I'd made by going to Yale. I never did change my mind about its value.\"[80]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas is sworn in as Assistant Secretary of Education for the Office for Civil Rights in 1981\nWith no job offers from major law firms, Thomas took a position as an associate with Missouri attorney general John Danforth, who offered him the prospect of practicing what he liked.[81] Thomas moved to Saint Louis to study for the Missouri bar, and was admitted on September 13, 1974.[82] He remained financially destitute even after leaving Yale, trying unsuccessfully on one occasion to make money by selling his blood at a blood bank, and hoped that by working for Danforth he might later acquire a job in private practice.[83][84]\n\n\nFrom 1974 to 1977, Thomas was an assistant attorney general of Missouri—the only African-American member of Danforth's staff. He worked first in the office's criminal appeals division and later in the revenue and taxation division. Thomas conducted lawsuits independently, gaining a reputation as a fair but controversial prosecutor.[85] Years later, after he joined the Supreme Court, Thomas recalled his position in Missouri as \"the best job I've ever had\".[86]\n\n\n\nWhen Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Thomas left to become an attorney in Monsanto's legal department in Saint Louis. He found the job unsatisfying, so left to rejoin Danforth in Washington, D.C., as a legislative assistant.[87] From 1979 to 1981, he handled energy issues for the Senate Commerce Committee. Thomas soon drew the attention of officials in the newly elected Reagan Administration as a Black conservative.[88] Pendleton James, Reagan's personnel director, offered Thomas the position of assistant secretary for civil rights at the U.S. Department of Education. Initially reluctant, Thomas agreed after Danforth and others pressed him to take the post.[89]\n\n![](image)Thomas in his office on May 18, 1981President Ronald Reagan nominated Thomas as assistant secretary of education for the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on May 1, 1981.[90][91] The Senate received the nomination on May 28, 1981, and Thomas was quickly confirmed before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on June 19, succeeding Cynthia Brown at the age of 32.[92][93] He held the position for a brief period before James offered him a new position as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a promotion that Thomas believed, as with his position in the OCR, was because of his race.[94] After James consulted the President, Thomas hesitantly took up the chair with Reagan's approval.[95]\n\n\nThomas chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) from 1982 to 1990. As chairman, he was tasked with enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in an agency that had been mutually resented by both Democrats and Republicans. He announced a reorganization of the EEOC and upgraded its record-keeping under an uncompromising leadership that eschewed racial quotas.[94][96] Concerned by the EEOC's limited statutory authority, Thomas sought to impose criminal penalties for employers who practiced employment discrimination, moving to shift funding towards agency investigators. Though he had been critical of affirmative action, Thomas also opposed the Reagan Administration's agenda to remove affirmative action policies, believing it to be a detraction from socioeconomic issues.[97][98]\n\n\nDuring Thomas's tenure, settlement award amounts to victims of discrimination tripled, while the number of suits filed decreased. The EEOC's lack of the use of goals and timetables drew criticism from civil rights advocates, who lobbied representatives to review the EEOC's practices; Thomas testified before Congress more than 50 times. Near the end of his final term, the EEOC came under congressional scrutiny for the mishandling of age-discrimination cases.[99][100]\n\n\n\n## District of Columbia Court of Appeals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas with President Ronald Reagan in 1986, while serving as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity CommissionIn early 1989, President George H. W. Bush expressed interest in nominating Thomas to a federal judgeship. Thomas, now at age 41, initially rejected the position, believing himself unready to make a lifetime commitment to being a judge. White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu advocated for his nomination, and Judge Laurence Silberman advised Thomas to accept an appointment.[101] Anticipating Thomas's nomination, a liberal coalition—including the Alliance for Justice and the National Organization for Women (NOW)—emerged to oppose his candidacy.[102]\n\n\nOn October 30, 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to fill the seat vacated by Robert Bork.[103][104] Thomas gained the support of other African American officials, including former transportation secretary William Coleman, and said that when meeting white Democratic staffers in the United States Senate, he was \"struck by how easy it had become for sanctimonious whites to accuse a black man of not caring about civil rights\".[65]\n\n\nIn February 1990, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Thomas by a vote of 12 to 1. On March 6, 1990, the Senate confirmed him to the Court of Appeals by a vote of 98 to 2.[102] He developed cordial relationships during his 19 months on the federal court, including with Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[65] During his judgeship, Thomas authored 19 opinions.[105]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Thomas was nominated to replace Justice Thurgood Marshall (*pictured*), who announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, due to ill health. Marshall would later give advice to Thomas after the confirmation.[106][107]\nWhen Justice William Brennan retired from the Supreme Court in July 1990, Thomas was Bush's favorite among the five candidates on his shortlist for the position. However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[108] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[109][110] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[111]\n\n\nLiberal interest groups sought to challenge Thomas's nomination by paralleling the same strategy used against Robert Bork's confirmation.[112] Abortion-rights groups, including the National Abortion Rights Action League and the NOW, were concerned that Thomas would be among those to overrule *Roe v. Wade*.[113] Republican officials in turn emphasized his personal history and gathered support from African American interest groups, including the NAACP.[114] Other civil rights organizations, such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Urban League, were convinced not to oppose Thomas, believing that he was Bush's last black nominee. On July 31, 1991, the board of directors of the NAACP voted against endorsing Thomas, announcing their opposition to his confirmation the same day.[115]\n\n\nThe American Bar Association (ABA) appraised Thomas as \"qualified\" for the Supreme Court.[116][a] The Bush Administration anticipated that the organization would rate Thomas more poorly than it thought he deserved, so pressured the ABA for at least the mid-level qualified rating while simultaneously discrediting it as partisan.[119] The ABA did rate Thomas as qualified, although with one of the lowest levels of support for a Supreme Court nominee.[120][121] It gave its highest rankings to Thomas in integrity and judicial temperament, and a mid-grade in professional competence.[122]\n\n\nOn September 10, 1991, formal confirmation hearings began before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[123][124] Thomas testified for 25 hours, the second-longest of any Supreme Court nominee.[125] He was reticent when answering senators' questions, recalling what had happened to Robert Bork when Bork expounded on his judicial philosophy during his confirmation hearings four years earlier.[126] As many of his earlier writings frequently referenced natural law, his views on the legal theory became a focus of the hearings. Thomas said he regarded natural law as a \"philosophical background\" to the Constitution.[127][128][129]\n\n\nNinety witnesses testified in favor of or against Thomas.[130] On September 27, 1991, the Judiciary Committee voted 13–1 to send his nomination to the full Senate without recommendation. A motion earlier in the day to give the nomination a favorable recommendation had failed, 7–7,[131] forwarding it to a full Senate vote.[130][132]\n\n\n\n### Anita Hill accusations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Clarence Thomas Opening StatementOctober 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Anita Hill Opening StatementOctober 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Thomas Second Hearing Day 1, Part 1October 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Thomas Second Hearing Day 1, Part 2October 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the committee's confirmation hearings, the Senate was debating whether to give final approval to Thomas's nomination. An FBI interview with Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas at the EEOC, was soon leaked to the press and allegations of sexual harassment followed.[133][134] As a result, on October 8, the final vote was postponed, and the confirmation hearings were reopened. It was only the third time in the Senate's history that such an action was taken and the first since 1925, when Justice Harlan F. Stone's nomination was recommitted to the Judiciary Committee.[132]\n\n\n\nHill was raised in Oklahoma and, like Thomas, graduated from Yale Law School.[135] She told James Brudney, a fellow Yale alumnus, about alleged sexual advances Thomas had made, telling him that she also did not wish to testify or make the allegations public to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Hill requested to the staff of Senator Joe Biden, the chair of the committee, that her allegations be made anonymously if she chose to testify and that Thomas not be informed of them, which Biden declined. Hill then notified Democratic staffers the day after the hearings had ended that she wished to make her allegations known to the committee.[136]\n\n![](image)Hill testifying during the second confirmation hearingsHill's allegations were corroborated by Susan Hoerchner, a judge in California, who also wished to remain anonymous.[137][138] Hoerchner called Harriet Grant, a chief counsel to Biden, to inform him of her allegations. She recalled that Thomas told Hill in an elevator at the EEOC that he would ruin her career if she spoke about his behavior.[139] When Grant told Hill and Hoerchner that the FBI would be involved, they were reluctant to be investigated. Hill declined to speak with the FBI, as she feared it would misconstrue her words, so instead arranged to deliver a written statement. The statement described how Thomas pressured her to date him, and included descriptions of him speaking about sexual interests involving pornographic films.[140] Hill also alleged that Thomas spoke of sex at work despite her being uncomfortable with the subject, adding, \"I sensed that my discomfort with his discussions only urged him on, as though my reaction of feeling ill at ease and vulnerable was what he wanted\".[141] The FBI report of its investigation was not made public. The White House announced that the FBI had found the allegations \"without foundation\". Congressional officials who had seen the report told the *New York Times* that \"the bureau could not draw any conclusion because of the 'he said, she said' nature of the subject\".[142][143] The use of the FBI was contentious in the Judiciary Committee because it answers to the president, who was sponsoring Thomas. Biden used the FBI instead of the committee's investigators to avoid the appearance of partisanship.[144]\n\n\n#### Second hearing[edit]\n\n\nThe hearings reconvened on October 11, 1991. Thomas was scheduled to go first, followed by a questioning of Hill by the committee.[145] He denied that he had said or done anything to Hill \"that could have been mistaken for sexual harassment\" and said that he would not answer any questions about his private life so as not to \"provide the rope for my own lynching\".[146]\n\n\nHill then testified for seven hours that ten years earlier Thomas had subjected her to comments of a sexual nature, calling it \"behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court\".[147][148][149] Her testimony included graphic details, and some senators questioned her aggressively.[150][151] Hill accused Thomas of making two sexually offensive remarks to her: comparing his penis to that of Long Dong Silver, a black porn star, and saying he had discovered a pubic hair on his Coca-Cola can.[152][153]\n\n\n\n> \n> And from my standpoint as a black American, as far as I'm concerned, [this proceeding] is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks that in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to the old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the United States Senate rather than hung from a tree.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThomas, testifying as part of his opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee[154]\n\nIn the evening, Thomas was recalled before the committee. He again denied the allegations and was prompted by Senator Orrin Hatch's questioning to launch a speech that criticized the proceeding as a \"high-tech lynching for uppity blacks\".[155] The speech resonated with Southern blacks and stimulated Thomas's supporters,[156] with public opinion shifting in his favor afterward.[157][158]\n\n\nHill was the only person to publicly testify that Thomas had sexually harassed her.[159] Angela Wright, who worked under Thomas at the EEOC and had alleged that \"Thomas had continually pressured her to date him and made sexual comments about women's bodies\",[160][161] and a corroborating witness she had named were not called to testify.[160] Their written depositions were entered into the congressional records unrebutted.[162][163][164] Sukari Hardnett, a former Thomas assistant, wrote to the Senate committee that although Thomas had not harassed her, \"If you were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being inspected and auditioned as a female.\"[165]\n\n\nIn addition to Hill and Thomas, the committee heard from several other witnesses over October 11–13.[132] A former colleague, Nancy Altman, who shared an office with Thomas at the Department of Education, testified that she heard virtually everything Thomas said over the course of two years and never heard a sexist or offensive comment from him. Altman did not find it credible that Thomas could have engaged in the conduct Hill alleged without any of the dozens of women he worked with noticing it.[166] Senator Alan K. Simpson, a member of the committee, asked why Hill met, dined with, and spoke by phone with Thomas on various occasions after they no longer worked together.[167][168] After the confirmation hearings ended, the event became a focus of divided scholarship, with authors who revisited it reaching varying conclusions.[158]\n\n\n\n### Senate votes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas was sworn in as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court by Justice Byron White on October 23, 1991. His wife, Virginia Thomas, looks on in the foreground.On October 15, 1991, the Senate voted to confirm Thomas as an associate justice, 52–48.[132] Thomas received the votes of 41 Republicans and 11 Democrats, while 46 Democrats and two Republicans voted to reject his nomination.[169]\n\n\nThe 99 days during which Thomas's nomination was pending in the Senate was the second-longest of the 16 nominees receiving a final vote since 1975, second only to Bork's 108 days.[132] The vote to confirm Thomas was the narrowest margin for approval in more than 100 years.[170]\n\n\nThomas received his commission on October 23 and took the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, becoming the Court's 106th justice.[171][b] He was sworn in by Justice Byron White in a ceremony initially scheduled for October 21, which was postponed because of the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist's wife, Natalie.[173][174][175] His first set of law clerks included future judges Gregory Katsas and Gregory Maggs and U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau.[176][177]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Vote to confirm the Thomas nomination\n |\n| --- |\n| October 15, 1991\n | Party\n | Total votes\n |\n| Democratic | Republican |\n| **Yea** | **11** | **41** | **52** |\n| Nay\n | 46\n | 02\n | 48\n |\n| **Result: Confirmed** |\n\n\n## Supreme Court of the United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official portrait, 2004\nAfter joining the Supreme Court, Thomas emerged as a member of the Court's conservative wing.[178] He aligned himself with Justice Antonin Scalia, with whom he shared an originalist approach to constitutional interpretation, and sided with him in 92 percent of cases during his first 13 years on the bench.[c] Over time, Thomas and Scalia's jurisprudence separated,[d] with Thomas favoring stronger emphasis on the Constitution's original understanding and demonstrating greater willingness to overrule precedent.[186] His appointment represented a decline in the Court's liberal wing, which then comprised only Justices John Paul Stevens and Harry Blackmun.[187][188]\n\n\nIn his early days on the Court, Thomas adopted a bold style of legal jurisprudence that alienated him from Justices Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor. He became the subject of intense media criticism for his decisions, including from figures that supported his appointment. Having previously experienced scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, Thomas believed in producing results without regard for his public image, a characteristic which embodied his lack of questions during oral arguments. His conservative approach moved O'Connor to take liberal positions but attracted Scalia. He formed a friendship with Justice Byron White, with whom he shared multiple interests, and found support from Justice David Souter.[189][190]\n\n\nThomas is a proponent of original meaning, incorporating what had been Scalia's narrower approach to the doctrine and the original intent of the Framers of the Constitution, including those espoused in the Declaration of Independence. As a means to impartiality, he is an advocate of judicial restraint to limit judicial discretion.[191][e] Thomas has been the most-willing of all justices on the Court to overrule precedent; according to Scalia, \"he does not believe in *stare decisis*, period\".[194][195][f] By October 1, 2012, he had written 475 opinions, including 171 majority opinions, 138 concurrences, and 166 dissenting opinions—approximately 10 percent of the 1,772 cases the Court had decided since he was elevated.[197] In 2016, Thomas wrote nearly twice as many opinions as any other justice.[9]\n\n\nThomas has been called the most conservative member of the Supreme Court,[190][198][199] though others gave Scalia that designation while they served on the Court together.[200][201] Thomas's influence, particularly among conservatives, was perceived to have significantly increased during Donald Trump's presidency,[202][203] and Trump appointed many of his former clerks to political positions and judgeships.[204][205][206] As the Supreme Court became more conservative, Thomas and his legal views became more influential on the Court.[207][208][209] This influence increased further by 2022, with Thomas authoring an opinion expanding Second Amendment rights and contributing to the Court's overruling of *Roe v. Wade*. He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[210][211][212]\n\n\n\n### Government powers and legal structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Court precedent[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Stare decisis in the U.S. legal system\n![](image)The Roberts Court in 2006Thomas believes the Court should not follow erroneous precedent, a view not currently held by other justices.[213] He has called to reconsider *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan* (1964), and criticized *Roe v. Wade* (1973) and *Gideon v. Wainwright* (1963). At a 2013 Federalist Society dinner, Judge Diane S. Sykes asked Thomas whether \"*stare decisis* doesn't hold much force for you?\" He responded, \"Oh, it sure does, but not enough to keep me from going to the Constitution\".[214][215] In 2019, *The New York Times* reported that data gathered by political scientist Stephen L. Wasby of the University at Albany found that Thomas wrote \"more than 250 concurring or dissenting opinions seriously questioning precedents, calling for their reconsideration or suggesting that they be overruled\".[214]\n\n\n\nIn the 2010 gun regulation case *McDonald v. City of Chicago*, Thomas sought to repeal past precedents and insisted that \"*stare decisis* is only an 'adjunct' of our duty as judges to decide by our best lights what the Constitution means\".[216] In *Gamble v. United States* (2019), he joined the majority opinion, which revisited an exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause, writing separately to state his position against the Court's prevailing view of multi-factor analysis regarding whether to follow precedent:[217]\n\n\n> In my view, if the Court encounters a decision that is demonstrably erroneous—i.e., one that is not a permissible interpretation of the text—the Court should correct the error, regardless of whether other factors support overruling the precedent. Federal courts may (but need not) adhere to an incorrect decision as precedent, but only when traditional tools of legal interpretation show that the earlier decision adopted a textually permissible interpretation of the law. A demonstrably incorrect judicial decision, by contrast, is tantamount to making law, and adhering to it both disregards the supremacy of the Constitution and perpetuates a usurpation of the legislative power.[218]\n> \n> \n\nIn *Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt* (2019),[g] Thomas wrote the 5–4 decision overruling *Nevada v. Hall* (1979), which said states could be sued in courts of other states. In his majority opinion, he noted that *stare decisis* \"is not an inexorable command\". Thomas explicitly disavowed the concept of reliance interests as justification for adhering to precedent. In dissent from *Hyatt III*, Justice Breyer asked what other decisions might eventually be overruled, and suggested *Roe v. Wade* might be among them. Breyer stated that it is best to leave precedents alone unless they are widely seen as erroneous or become impractical.[219]\n\n\n#### Executive power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas speaks with Akhil Reed Amar of the Constitutional Accountability Center in 2012\nThomas has supported a broad interpretation of executive power and has theorized about its constitutional aspects.[9] In *Hamdi v. Rumsfeld* (2004),[h] he dissented from the majority opinion, arguing that courts should have had complete deference to the executive decision to determine that Yaser Esam Hamdi was an enemy combatant.[220] He wrote in *Hamdi* that the president does not have the singular authority to detain a citizen who was captured while in enemy service.[221] In addition, Thomas noted that \"structural advantages [of the Presidency] are most important in the national-security and foreign-affairs contexts\" and thus \"the Founders intended that the President have primary responsibility—along with the necessary power—to protect the national security and to conduct the nation's foreign relations\".[222]\n\n\nThomas was one of three justices to dissent in *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* (2006),[i] which concerned whether the president can establish military tribunals to try detained enemy combatants for war crimes conspiracy. As in *Hamdi*, he relied on *The Federalist Papers* in proposing that the president is responsible for protecting national security.[223][224]\n\n\nIn *Zivotofsky v. Kerry* (2015), Thomas relied on the Articles of Confederation for his opinion. He wrote, \"the President is not confined to those powers expressly identified in [the Constitution]\", concluding that residual foreign affairs were vested in the president, not Congress.[225] Rather than finding the original intent or original understanding, Thomas wrote in the case that he sought the \"understanding of executive power [that] prevailed in America\" at the time of the founding.[226]\n\n\nIn the Ninth Circuit case *East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump* (2018), which placed an injunction on the Trump administration's asylum policy, Thomas dissented from a denial of stay application. The Ninth Circuit imposed an injunction on the Trump administration's policy granting asylum only to refugees entering from a designated port of entry, ruling that it violated the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Ninth Circuit Judge Jay Bybee's majority opinion concluded that denial of the ability to apply for asylum regardless of entry point is \"the hollowest of rights that an alien must be allowed to apply for asylum regardless of whether she arrived through a port of entry if another rule makes her categorically ineligible for asylum based on precisely that fact.\" Gorsuch, Alito, Kavanaugh also dissented in the decision to deny a stay to the Ninth Circuit's injunction.[227][228]\n\n\n\n#### Federalism[edit]\n\n\nThomas views federalism as a foundational limit on federal power.[229] In interpreting congressional powers, he has defended strict constructionism—an approach Scalia rejected.[230] On September 24, 1999, Thomas delivered the Dwight D. Opperman Lecture at Drake University Law School on \"Why Federalism Matters\", saying that it was an essential safeguard to protect \"individual liberty and the private ordering of our lives\". He also asserted that federalism enhances self-government, protects individual liberty by separating political power, and checks federal authority.[231] According to law professor Ann Althouse, the Court has yet to move toward \"the broader, more principled version of federalism propounded by Justice Thomas\".[232]\n\n> \n> Nothing in the Constitution deprives the people of each State of the power to prescribe eligibility requirements for the candidates who seek to represent them in Congress. The Constitution is simply silent on this question. And where the Constitution is silent, it raises no bar to action by the States or the people.\n> \n> \n> — Thomas, dissenting in *U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton* (1995)[233][229]\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nIn the 1995 case *U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton*,[j] parties challenged the constitutionality of an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution that added age, citizenship, and residency requirements for congressional service. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the amendment unconstitutional, also affirming the previous rulings of both the state's trial court and the Arkansas Supreme Court; Justice Stevens wrote for the majority. Thomas—joined by Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, and Scalia—dissented in what is to date his lengthiest opinion.[234] He argued that states could impose term limits on members of Congress, as state citizens are \"the ultimate source of the Constitution's authority\".[235] That same year, Thomas concurred in *United States v. Lopez*, which invalidated the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 for going beyond the Commerce Clause. He opined that the Court had deviated \"from the original understanding of the Commerce Clause\" and that the substantial effects test, \"if taken to its logical extreme, would give Congress a 'police power' over all aspects of American life\".[236]\n\n\nThomas dissented in *Gonzales v. Raich* (2005), which held that the Controlled Substances Act applies to homegrown marijuana, on the grounds of original meaning.[237] His interpretation of the interstate commerce clause differed from Scalia's, and they also held conflicting beliefs about the general welfare clause, the Indian commerce clause, and the necessary and proper clause. Scalia joined the majority opinion, but Thomas disputed the relevance of homegrown marijuana to interstate commerce, writing that if Congress can regulate it, \"it can regulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers\".[238][239]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Comstock* (2010),[k] the Supreme Court, in a majority opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, held that the Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to enact a law that authorized the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to detain a mentally ill and dangerous federal prisoner beyond the DOJ's original lawful date. Thomas's dissent, joined by Scalia, argued that the clause allows Congress only to execute enumerated powers.[240] When the Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* (2012), he authored a short dissent and joined the joint dissent finding the act completely unconstitutional.[241]\n\n\n\n#### Federal statutes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas Swears in Sonny Perdue as the 31st Secretary of Agriculture, 2017As of 2007, Thomas was the justice most willing to exercise judicial review of federal statutes but among the least likely to overturn state statutes.[242] According to a *New York Times* editorial, \"from 1994 to 2005 ... Justice Thomas voted to overturn federal laws in 34 cases and Justice Scalia in 31, compared with just 15 for Justice Stephen Breyer\".[243]\n\n\nIn *Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder*, Thomas was the sole dissenter, voting to throw out Section Five of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Section Five requires states with a history of racial voter discrimination—mostly states from the old South—to gain Justice Department clearance when revising election procedures. Congress had reauthorized Section Five in 2006 for another 25 years, but Thomas said the law was no longer necessary, stating that the rate of black voting in seven Section Five states was higher than the national average. He wrote, \"the violence, intimidation and subterfuge that led Congress to pass Section 5 and this court to uphold it no longer remains.\"[244] He took this position again in *Shelby County v. Holder*, voting with the majority and concurring with the reasoning that struck down Section Five.[245]\n\n\n\n### Individual rights[edit]\n\n\n#### Free speech and expression[edit]\n\n\nThomas has generally written opinions in favor of protections for free speech.[246][247] He has voted in favor of First Amendment claims in cases involving issues including campaign contributions and commercial speech.[248] A 2002 study by Eugene Volokh found Thomas to be the justice second-most likely to uphold free speech claims (tied with Souter).[249] He has ruled against laws regulating hate speech, as in *R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul* (1992), *United States v. Stevens* (2010), and *Snyder v. Phelps* (2011).[250] Conversely, he has been reluctant to uphold speech deemed intimidating, as in *Virginia v. Black* (2003).[251][252]\n\n\nThomas's first opinion on free speech was the 1995 case *McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission*,[l] finding that the Founding Era contained the expansive use of anonymous pamphlets and columns. Although he agreed with the result of Justice John Paul Stevens's majority opinion, he disagreed with its methodology and did not join it.[253] With the announcement of *McIntyre*, the Court also decided *Rubin v. Coors Brewing Company*, in which Thomas wrote his first majority opinion concerning free speech. In *Rubin*, Thomas was joined unanimously in ruling unconstitutional a 1935 federal law that prohibited beer labels from disclosing alcohol content. He similarly concurred the next year in *44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island*, which struck down a state law that banned the advertisement of prices of alcoholic beverages.[254]\n\n\n\nIn *Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC* (1996), the Supreme Court ruled against the decision of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to fine the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee for running a political advertisement targeting Senator Tim Wirth. Thomas joined Justice Stephen Breyer's majority opinion in the case, but wrote separately to call against the framework established in the previous campaign finance case of *Buckley v Valeo* (1976):\n\n\n> I believe that contribution limits infringe as directly and as seriously upon freedom of political expression and association as do expenditure limits. The protections of the First Amendment do not depend upon so fine a line as that between spending money to support a candidate or group and giving money to the candidate or group to spend for the same purpose. In principle, people and groups give money to candidates and other groups for the same reason that they spend money in support of those candidates and groups: because they share social, economic, and political beliefs and seek to have those beliefs affect governmental policy.[255]\n> \n> \n\n![](image)The Roberts Court pictured in 2017Thomas has made public his belief that all limits on federal campaign contributions are unconstitutional and should be struck down.[256] In *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010), Thomas joined the majority but dissented in part, arguing that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act's disclaimer and disclosure requirements were unconstitutional. He reinforced his defense of anonymous speech in *Doe v. Reed* (2010), writing that the First Amendment protects \"political association\" by means of signing a petition.[257]\n\nIn *Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District* (1969), Justice Hugo Black dissented from the Court's opinion invalidating a school's policy to forbid students from wearing armbands in protest of the Vietnam War. Thomas endorsed Black's dissent in *Morse v. Frederick* (2007), concurring with narrowing the rationale of *Tinker* and arguing that *Tinker* be overruled as it was a constitutionally unsupported \"sea change in students’ speech rights\".[258] In his view, the Constitution does not govern whether public school students may be disciplined for expressive behavior.[259]\n\n\nIn *Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L.*—in which a high school punished a student for sending a profane message on social media about her school, softball team, and cheer team—Thomas was the lone dissenter, siding with the school. He criticized the majority for relying on \"vague considerations\" and wrote that historically schools could discipline students in similar situations.[260] In *Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans*, he joined the majority opinion that Texas's decision to deny a request for a Confederate Battle Flag specialty license plate was constitutional.[261]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas speaks at the Library of Congress in September 2012\nThomas agreed with the judgment in *McDonald v. Chicago* (2010) that the right to keep and bear arms is applicable to state and local governments, but he wrote a separate concurrence finding that an individual's right to bear arms is fundamental as a privilege of American citizenship under the Privileges or Immunities Clause rather than as a fundamental right under the due process clause.[262] The four justices in the plurality opinion specifically rejected incorporation under the privileges or immunities clause, \"declin[ing] to disturb\" the holding in the *Slaughter-House Cases*, which, according to the plurality, had held that the clause applied only to federal matters.[263][264]\n\n\nSince 2010, Thomas has dissented from denial of certiorari in several Second Amendment cases. He voted to grant certiorari in *Friedman v. City of Highland Park* (2015), which upheld bans on certain semi-automatic rifles; *Jackson v. San Francisco* (2014), which upheld trigger lock ordinances similar to those struck down in *Heller*; *Peruta v. San Diego County* (2016), which upheld restrictive concealed carry licensing in California; and *Silvester v. Becerra* (2017), which upheld waiting periods for firearm purchasers who have already passed background checks and already own firearms. He was joined by Scalia in the first two cases, and by Gorsuch in *Peruta*.[265][266][267][268]\n\n\nThomas dissented from the denial of an application for a stay presented to Chief Justice Roberts in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit case *Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives* (2019), a case challenging the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks. Only Thomas and Gorsuch publicly dissented.[269]\n\n\nThomas authored the majority opinion in *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (2022), guaranteeing the right of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms in public. The case held: \"When the Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's 'unqualified command.'\" Justice Stephen Breyer, dissenting, wrote, \"when courts interpret the Second Amendment, it is constitutionally proper, indeed often necessary, for them to consider the serious dangers and consequences of gun violence that lead States to regulate firearms.\"\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas with U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson, 2007\nIn cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, Thomas often favors police over defendants. For example, his opinion for the Court in *Board of Education v. Earls* upheld drug testing for students involved in extracurricular activities, and he wrote again for the Court in *Samson v. California*, permitting random searches on parolees. He dissented in *Georgia v. Randolph*, which prohibited warrantless searches that one resident approves and the other opposes, arguing that the Court's decision in *Coolidge v. New Hampshire* controlled the case. In *Indianapolis v. Edmond*, Thomas described the Court's extant case law as having held that \"suspicionless roadblock seizures are constitutionally permissible if conducted according to a plan that limits the discretion of the officers conducting the stops.\" He expressed doubt that those cases were decided correctly but concluded that since the litigants in the case at bar had not briefed or argued that the earlier cases be overruled, he believed that the Court should assume their validity and rule accordingly.[270] Thomas was in the majority in *Kyllo v. United States*, which held that the use of thermal imaging technology to probe a suspect's home without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\nIn cases involving schools, Thomas has advocated greater respect for the doctrine of *in loco parentis*,[271] which he defines as \"parents delegat[ing] to teachers their authority to discipline and maintain order\".[272] His dissent in *Safford Unified School District v. Redding* illustrates his application of this postulate in the Fourth Amendment context. School officials in the *Safford* case had a reasonable suspicion that 13-year-old Savana Redding was illegally distributing prescription-only drugs. All the justices concurred that it was therefore reasonable for the school officials to search Redding, and the main issue before the Court was only whether the search went too far by becoming a strip search or the like.[272] All the justices except Thomas concluded that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The majority required a finding of danger or reason to believe drugs were hidden in a student's underwear in order to justify a strip search. Thomas wrote, \"It is a mistake for judges to assume the responsibility for deciding which school rules are important enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules are not\"[273] and \"reasonable suspicion that Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of these policies, therefore, justified a search extending to any area where small pills could be concealed\". He added, \"[t]here can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to conduct the search.\"[272]\n\n\n\n#### Sixth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nIn *Doggett v. United States*, the defendant had technically been a fugitive from the time he was indicted in 1980 until his arrest in 1988. The Court held that the delay between indictment and arrest violated Doggett's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, finding that the government had been negligent in pursuing him and that he was unaware of the indictment.[274] Thomas dissented, arguing that the Speedy Trial Clause's purpose was to prevent \"'undue and oppressive incarceration' and the 'anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation'\" and that the case implicated neither.[274] He cast the case instead as \"present[ing] the question [of] whether, independent of these core concerns, the Speedy Trial Clause protects an accused from two additional harms: (1) prejudice to his ability to defend himself caused by the passage of time; and (2) disruption of his life years after the alleged commission of his crime\". Thomas dissented from the court's decision to, as he saw it, answer the former in the affirmative.[274] He wrote that dismissing the conviction \"invites the Nation's judges to indulge in ad hoc and result-driven second guessing of the government's investigatory efforts. Our Constitution neither contemplates nor tolerates such a role\".[275]\n\n\nIn *Garza v. Idaho*, Thomas and Gorsuch, in dissent, suggested that *Gideon v. Wainwright* (1963), which required that indigent criminal defendants be provided counsel, was wrongly decided and should be overruled.[214]\n\n\n\n##### Eighth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nThomas was among the dissenters in *Atkins v. Virginia* and *Roper v. Simmons*, which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the application of the death penalty to certain classes of persons. In *Kansas v. Marsh*, his opinion for the Court indicated a belief that the Constitution affords states broad procedural latitude in imposing the death penalty, provided they remain within the limits of *Furman v. Georgia* and *Gregg v. Georgia*, the 1976 case in which the Court reversed its 1972 ban on death sentences if states followed procedural guidelines.[*citation needed*]\n\n![](image)Thomas speaking to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue in 2017\nIn *Hudson v. McMillian*, a prisoner had been beaten, sustaining a cracked lip, broken dental plate, loosened teeth, cuts, and bruises. Although these were not \"serious injuries\", the Court believed, it held that \"the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury.\"[276] Dissenting, Thomas wrote, \"a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the Court today goes far beyond our precedents.\"[276] Thomas's vote—in one of his first cases after joining the Court—was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion).[277] His opinion was criticized by the seven-member majority, which wrote that, by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, it ignored \"the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment\".[276] According to historian David Garrow, Thomas's dissent in *Hudson* was a \"classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him\".[278] Thomas later responded to the accusation \"that I supported the beating of prisoners in that case. Well, one must either be illiterate or fraught with malice to reach that conclusion ... no honest reading can reach such a conclusion.\"[278]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Bajakajian*, Thomas joined with the Court's liberal justices to write the majority opinion declaring a fine unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The fine was for failing to declare more than $300,000 in a suitcase on an international flight. Under a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), the passenger would have had to forfeit the entire amount. Thomas noted that the case required a distinction to be made between civil forfeiture and a fine exacted with the intention of punishing the respondent. He found that the forfeiture in this case was clearly intended as a punishment at least in part, was \"grossly disproportional\" and violated the Excessive Fines Clause.[279]\n\n\nThomas has written that the \"Cruel and Unusual Punishment\" clause \"contains no proportionality principle\", meaning that the question whether a sentence should be rejected as \"cruel and unusual\" depends only on the sentence itself, not on what crime is being punished.[280] He was concurring with the Court's decision to reject a request for review from a petitioner who had been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison under California's \"Three-Strikes\" law for stealing some golf clubs because the combined value of the clubs made the theft a felony and he had two previous felonies in his criminal record.\n\n\n\n#### Race, equal protection, and affirmative action[edit]\n\n\nThomas believes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of race, such as race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment. In *Adarand Constructors v. Peña*, he wrote, \"there is a 'moral [and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That [affirmative action] programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race.\"[281]\n\n\nIn *Gratz v. Bollinger*, Thomas wrote, \"a State's use of racial discrimination in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.\"[282] In *Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1*, Thomas joined the opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, who wrote that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"[283] Concurring, Thomas wrote, \"if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories\", and charged that the dissent carried \"similarities\" to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in *Brown v. Board of Education*.[283]\n\n\nLikewise, in *Grutter v. Bollinger*, Thomas approvingly quoted Justice Harlan's *Plessy v. Ferguson* dissent: \"Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\"[284] In a concurrence in *Missouri v. Jenkins* (1995), he wrote that the Missouri District Court \"has read our cases to support the theory that black students suffer an unspecified psychological harm from segregation that retards their mental and educational development. This approach not only relies upon questionable social science research rather than constitutional principle, but it also rests on an assumption of black inferiority.\"[285]\n\n\nSome legal scholars have called Thomas's views on race and the constitution \"idiosyncratic\",[286] \"pessimistic\", or \"fatalistic\".[287] For example, professors Corey Robin and Stephen F. Smith have characterized Thomas's philosophy as grounded in a form of black nationalism that sees governmental attempts to address racism as either futile or counterproductive.[287][288][289][290] That view contrasts with the belief that laws should be race-neutral because racial discrimination is no longer a serious problem in the United States.[286]\n\n\nThomas joined the majority in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard*, which struck down affirmative action in college admissions. He filed a concurring opinion, which he read from the bench, a rare practice for Supreme Court justices.[291]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion and family planning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justice Thomas administers the oath of office to Amy Coney Barrett (Oct 26, 2020)\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Casey* (1992), the Court reaffirmed *Roe v. Wade*. Thomas and Justice Byron White joined the dissenting opinions of Rehnquist and Scalia. Rehnquist wrote, \"[w]e believe *Roe* was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to *stare decisis* in constitutional cases.\"[293] Scalia's opinion concluded that the right to obtain an abortion is not \"a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States\".[293] \"[T]he Constitution says absolutely nothing about it,\" Scalia wrote, \"and [ ] the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed\".[293]\n\n\nIn *Stenberg v. Carhart* (2000), the Court struck down a state ban on partial-birth abortion, concluding that it failed *Casey*'s \"undue burden\" test. Thomas dissented, writing, \"Although a State *may* permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State *must* do so.\"[294][*citation needed*] He went on to criticize the reasoning of the *Casey* and *Stenberg* majorities: \"The majority's insistence on a health exception is a fig leaf barely covering its hostility to any abortion regulation by the States—a hostility that *Casey* purported to reject.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Gonzales v. Carhart* (2007), the Court rejected a facial challenge to a federal ban on partial-birth abortion.[295][*citation needed*] Concurring, Thomas asserted that the court's abortion jurisprudence had no basis in the Constitution but that the court had accurately applied that jurisprudence in rejecting the challenge.[295][*citation needed*] He added that the Court was not deciding the question of whether Congress had the power to outlaw partial-birth abortions: \"[W]hether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court [in this case] ... the parties did not raise or brief that issue; it is outside the question presented; and the lower courts did not address it.\"[295][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Thomas dissented when the Court voted not to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.[296] Alito and Gorsuch joined Thomas's dissent, arguing that the Court was \"abdicating its judicial duty\".[297]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Thomas joined three of the Court's other conservative justices in voting to reject a stay to temporarily block a law restricting abortion in Louisiana.[298] The law that the court temporarily stayed, in a 5–4 decision, would have required that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a hospital.[299]\n\n\nIn *Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc.* (2019), a per curiam decision upholding the provision of Indiana's abortion restriction regarding fetal remains disposal on rational basis scrutiny and upholding the lower court rulings striking down the provision banning race, sex, and disability, Thomas wrote a concurring opinion comparing abortion and birth control to eugenics, which was practiced in the U.S. in the early 20th century and by the Nazi government in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, and comparing *Box* to *Buck v. Bell* (1927), which upheld a forced sterilization law regarding people with mental disabilities. In his opinion, Thomas quoted Margaret Sanger's support for contraception as a form of personal reproductive control that she considered superior to \"the horrors of abortion and infanticide\" (Sanger's words).[300][*citation needed*] His opinion referred several times to historian/journalist Adam Cohen's book *Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck*; shortly afterward, Cohen published a sharply worded criticism saying that Thomas had misinterpreted his book and misunderstood the history of the eugenics movement.[301] In *Box*, only Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ginsburg publicly registered their votes. Ginsburg and Sotomayor concurred in part and dissented in part, stating they would have upheld the lower court decision on striking down the race, sex, and disability ban as well as the lower court decision striking down the fetal remains disposal provision.[300][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a concurring opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), Thomas wrote that \"any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous'\",[*citation needed*] and argued that the Supreme Court should go beyond *Roe vs. Wade* and reconsider other substantive due process precedents, including those established in *Griswold v. Connecticut* (1965), *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003) and *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015). The overturning of these previous decisions would enable states to limit access to contraception, criminalize sodomy, and criminalize same-sex marriage, respectively.[302][303][304]\n\n\n\n#### LGBTQ rights[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Evans* (1996), Thomas joined Scalia's dissenting opinion arguing that Amendment Two to the Colorado State Constitution did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Colorado amendment forbade any judicial, legislative, or executive action designed to protect persons from discrimination based on \"homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships\".[305][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003), Thomas issued a one-page dissent in which he called the Texas statute prohibiting sodomy \"uncommonly silly\", a phrase originally used by Justice Potter Stewart. He then said that if he were a member of the Texas legislature he would vote to repeal the law, as it was not a worthwhile use of \"law enforcement resources\" to police private sexual behavior. But Thomas opined that the Constitution does not contain a right to privacy and therefore did not vote to strike the statute down. He saw the issue as a matter for states to decide for themselves.[306][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia* (2020), Thomas joined Alito and Kavanaugh in dissenting from the decision that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. (Thomas and Alito wrote a dissent together, and Kavanaugh wrote separately.) The 6–3 ruling's majority consisted of two Republican-appointed justices, Roberts and Gorsuch, along with four Democratic-appointed justices: Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.[307]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Thomas joined the other justices in denying an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but wrote a separate opinion reiterating his dissent from *Obergefell v. Hodges* and expressing his belief that it was wrongly decided.[308][309][310] In July 2021, he was one of three justices, with Gorsuch and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[311][312][313] In November 2021, Thomas dissented from the majority of justices in a 6-3 vote to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[314] Alito and Gorsuch also dissented, and the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[315][316]\n\n\n\n### Oral arguments[edit]\n\n\nDuring a 10-year period from February 2006 to February 2016, Thomas read his opinions from the bench but asked no questions during oral arguments.[317][318] He said in 2013 that it was \"unnecessary in deciding cases to ask that many questions ... we should listen to lawyers who are arguing their cases, and I think we should allow the advocates to advocate.\"[319] By May 2020, he had asked questions in two oral arguments since 2006.[320]\n\n\nThomas took a more active role in questioning when the Supreme Court shifted to holding teleconferenced arguments in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic;[321][322][323][320] before that, he had spoken during 32 of the roughly 2,400 arguments since 1991.[324] Since the court resumed in-person oral arguments at the beginning of the 2021 term, the justices agreed to allow Thomas to ask the first question to each advocate.[325]\n\n\nThomas has given many reasons for his silence, including self-consciousness about how he speaks, a preference for listening to those arguing the case, and difficulty getting in a word.[319] His speaking and listening habits may have been influenced by his Gullah upbringing, during which his English was relatively unpolished.[18][62][326] In a 2017 paper in *Northwestern University Law Review*, RonNell Andersen Jones and Aaron L. Nielson wrote that while asking few questions, \"in many ways, [Thomas] is a model questioner.\"[327][328]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas and his wife, Ginni Thomas, on their wedding day in 1987\nIn 1971, Thomas married Kathy Grace Ambush. The couple had one child, Jamal Adeen, born in 1973, who is Thomas's sole child. Thomas and his first wife separated in 1981 and divorced in 1984.[329][330] In 1987, Thomas married Virginia Lamp, a lobbyist and aide to U.S. Representative Dick Armey.[331] In 1997, they took in Thomas's six-year-old great-nephew, Mark Martin Jr.,[332] who had lived with his mother in Savannah public housing.[333] Since 1999, Thomas and his wife have traveled across the U.S. in a motorcoach between Court terms.[334][335]\n\n\nVirginia \"Ginni\" Thomas has remained active in conservative politics, serving as a consultant to The Heritage Foundation and as founder and president of Liberty Central.[336] In 2011, she stepped down from Liberty Central to open a conservative lobbying firm, touting her \"experience and connections\", meeting with newly elected Republican representatives and calling herself an \"ambassador to the Tea Party\".[337][338] Also in 2011, 74 Democratic members of the House of Representatives wrote that Justice Thomas should recuse himself on cases regarding the Affordable Care Act because of \"appearance of a conflict of interest\" based on his wife's work.[339]\n\n\n*The Washington Post* reported in February 2021 that Ginni Thomas apologized to a group of Thomas's former clerks on the email listserv \"Thomas Clerk World\" for her role in contributing to a rift relating to \"pro-Trump postings and former Thomas clerk John Eastman, who spoke at the rally and represented Trump in some of his failed lawsuits filed to overturn the election results\".[340] In March 2022, texts between Ginni Thomas and Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows from 2020 were turned over to the Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.[341] The texts show Ginni Thomas repeatedly urging Meadows to overturn the election results and repeating conspiracy theories about ballot fraud.[342] In response, 24 Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate demanded that Thomas recuse himself from cases related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol on the grounds that Ginni Thomas's involvement in such efforts raised questions about his impartiality.[343] An April 2022 Quinnipiac poll found that 52% of Americans agreed that, in light of Ginni Thomas's texts about overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election, Thomas should have recused himself from related cases.[344]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nThomas was reconciled to the Catholic Church in the mid-1990s.[345] In his autobiography, he criticized the church for failing to grapple with racism in the 1960s during the civil rights movement, saying it was not so \"adamant about ending racism then as it is about ending abortion now\".[346] As of 2021, Thomas is one of 14 practicing Catholic justices in the Court's history and one of six currently serving (along with Alito, Kavanaugh, Roberts, Sotomayor and Barrett).[347]\n\n\n\n### Literary influences[edit]\n\n\nIn 1975, when Thomas read economist Thomas Sowell's *Race and Economics*, he found an intellectual foundation for his philosophy.[348][349] The book criticizes social reform by government and argues for individual action to overcome circumstances and adversity. Ayn Rand's works also influenced him, particularly *The Fountainhead*, and he later required his staffers to watch the 1949 film version of the novel.[350][351] Thomas acknowledges \"some very strong libertarian leanings\", though he does not consider himself a libertarian.[352]\n\n\nThomas has said novelist Richard Wright is the most influential writer in his life; Wright's books *Native Son* and *Black Boy* \"capture[d] a lot of the feelings that I had inside that you learn how to repress\".[329] *Native Son* and Ralph Ellison's *Invisible Man* are Thomas's two favorite novels.[185]\n\n\n\n### Moira Smith allegations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Moira Smith, vice-president and general counsel of a natural gas distributor in Alaska, said that Thomas groped her buttocks at a dinner party in 1999. She was a Truman Foundation scholar helping the director of the foundation set up for a dinner party honoring Thomas and David Adkins. Smith's roommates at the time confirmed that she had told them about the incident. Thomas denied the allegation.[353][354]\n\n\nLouis Blair, who was the head of the Truman Foundation and hosted the dinner at his home, said he had \"no recollection of the incident\" and that he had neither seen nor heard of Smith's allegation. Blair acknowledged that he was in the kitchen most of the time so, if the incident happened, he wouldn't have seen it, but was also \"skeptical that the justice and Moira would have been alone\", given that there were approximately 16 people in three rooms.[355][356] Norma Stevens, who attended the event, said that the incident \"couldn't have happened\" because Thomas was never alone, as he was the guest of honor.[357]\n\n\n\n### Nondisclosure of finances[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Crow's foundation gave $105,000 to Yale Law School, Thomas's alma mater, for the \"Justice Thomas Portrait Fund\", tax filings show.[360]\n\n\nIn 2011, *Politico* reported that Crow gave $500,000 to a Tea Party group founded by Thomas's wife and that Thomas had failed to report her income on his disclosure for more than a decade.[361][362] Also that year, the advocacy group Common Cause reported that between 2003 and 2007, Thomas failed to disclose $686,589 in income his wife earned from The Heritage Foundation, instead reporting \"none\" where \"spousal noninvestment income\" would be reported on his Supreme Court financial disclosure forms.[363] The next week, Thomas said the disclosure of his wife's income had been \"inadvertently omitted due to a misunderstanding of the filing instructions\".[364] He amended reports going back to 1989.[365]\n\n\nIn April 2023, ProPublica reported that Thomas had \"accepted luxury trips virtually every year\" from Crow for two decades and failed to report them. They included flights on Crow's private jet, cruises on Crow's superyacht at locations around the globe, and stays at Crow's private resort in the Adirondacks and the private club Bohemian Grove.[360][366][362] The Ethics in Government Act requires justices, judges, members of Congress and federal officials to annually disclose gifts they receive.[367] Many elected officials criticized the appearance of impropriety, given Crow's donations to conservative causes and Republican candidates, and his service on the Board of Trustees for the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, which have filed amicus briefs before the Supreme Court.[368][360]\n\n\nAlso in April 2023, ProPublica reported that one of Crow's companies bought a house and two empty lots on a residential street in Savannah, Georgia, for $133,000 in 2014. The properties were owned in equal parts by Thomas, his mother, and the family of his deceased brother. Thomas did not report the sale on the disclosure form he filed for 2014. Crow's company also paid for extensive renovations of the house, where Thomas's mother still lives.[369][362]\n\n\nIn May 2023, ProPublica reported that Crow had paid for private school tuition for Thomas's grandnephew, Mark Martin, of whom Thomas had legal custody. Thomas did not report the payments on his financial disclosure forms, while ethics law experts said that they were required to be disclosed as gifts. A bank statement[370] showed that monthly tuition at Hidden Lake Academy, one of the two schools Crow paid for, was $6,200. Mark Paoletta, a longtime friend of Thomas, said that Crow paid for one year each at Hidden Lake and Randolph-Macon Academy, which ProPublica estimated to total around $100,000.[371][362]\n\n\nOn the same day, *The Washington Post* reported that in January 2012 conservative judicial activist Leonard Leo had Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway's polling firm bill the Judicial Education Project $25,000, which her firm then paid to Ginni Thomas's firm, Liberty Consulting, for a total of $80,000 between June 2011 and June 2012. Leo instructed Conway not to mention Thomas's name on the paperwork. The documents the newspaper reviewed did not indicate the nature of the work Thomas did for the Judicial Education Project or Conway's company. In 2012 the Judicial Education Project filed a brief to the Supreme Court in a landmark voting rights case.[372][362]\n\n\nIn 2023, *The New York Times* reported that a friend had paid for Thomas's Prevost Le Mirage XL Marathon RV, purchased for $267,230 in 1999 (roughly equivalent to $489,000 in 2023). Anthony Welters, a former UnitedHealthcare executive and a close friend, lent Thomas the purchase price. In response to a Senate inquiry, Welters revealed that the loan was discharged in 2008, forgiving much of the original balance. A bank would have been unlikely to offer such a loan, given the Marathon's high capacity for customization, which can make used models difficult to appraise. Thomas had previously said that he \"had scrimped and saved to afford the motor coach\", according to the *Times*, and a friend, Armstrong Williams, said that Thomas had told him that \"he saved up all his money to buy it\". When the loan was forgiven, Thomas was required to disclose the money as a gift.[373][374][375][362]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Thomas filed his financial disclosure report for 2022, listing three trips on Crow's jets.[376][377]\n\n\n\n## Honors and recognition[edit]\n\n\nThomas was awarded the 1992 Horatio Alger Award by the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans.[378] In 2001, Thomas was awarded the Francis Boyer Award presented by the American Enterprise Institute.[379] In 2012, Thomas received an honorary degree from the College of the Holy Cross, his alma mater.[380] In 2020, Belmont Abbey College awarded him the Benedict Leadership Award for his devotion to the Catholic faith and government service.[381]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* In the 1996 film *Jerry Maguire*, after Tom Cruise's character makes a pass at his employee (played by Renee Zellweger), he apologizes with, \"I feel like Clarence Thomas.\"[382]\n* Wendell Pierce portrayed Thomas in the 2016 film *Confirmation*.\n* In May 2023, Michael Kirk directed a *Frontline* documentary about Thomas's life and career, narrated by Will Lyman.[383][384] John Danforth, who was interviewed for the documentary, wrote in an op-ed published in *The Wall Street Journal* that the excerpts of his interview included in the film were only \"biographical filler\" and criticized the film as a whole as \"a two-hour hit job on the character of Clarence Thomas\".[385]\n\n\n## Writings[edit]\n\n\n* \"Why Black Americans Should Look to Conservative Policies\". *The Heritage Lectures*.

In that same period, Thomas was the third-most-frequent dissenter on the Court, behind Stevens and Scalia.[179] Scalia's and Thomas's agreement rate peaked in 1996 at 98%.[179] By 2004, other pairs of justices were more closely aligned than Scalia and Thomas.[180]\n4. **^** Thomas's close early association with Scalia came under scrutiny by critics in multiple law review articles. In November 1996, *Emerge* magazine titled him as \"Uncle Thomas: Lawn Jockey of the Far Right\".[181] Linda Greenhouse observed that Thomas voted with Scalia 91% of the time during October Term 2006, and with Justice John Paul Stevens the least, 36% of the time.[182] Biographer Jan Crawford noted that Scalia often joined Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia.[183][184] Biographer Corey Robin has called the idea that Thomas followed Scalia's votes a debunked myth.[185]\n5. **^** Thomas's jurisprudence has also been compared to that of Justice Hugo Black, who \"resisted the tendency to create social policy out of 'whole cloth.'\" According to the same critic, Thomas generally declines to engage in judicial lawmaking, viewing the Court's constitutional role as the interpretation of law, rather than making law.[192][193]\n6. **^** In 2005, while an assistant professor of law at Notre Dame Law School, future-Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that Thomas supports statutory *stare decisis*. Her examples included his concurring opinion in *Fogerty v. Fantasy* (1994).[196]\n7. **^** \"Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt\" (PDF). U.S. Supreme Court. 2018.

And in the transcript of your October 7 interview, you responded to a question saying that it was sexual harassment.  \n\n\"A: In my opinion, based on my reading of the law, yes, it was. But later on, immediately following that response, I noted to the press that I did not raise a claim of sexual harassment in this complaint. It seems to me that the behavior has to be evaluated on its own with regard to the fitness of this individual to act as an Associate Justice. It seems to me that even if it does not rise to the level of sexual harassment, it is behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court.\"\n149. **^** Pollitt, Katha. *Subject to Debate: Sense and Dissents on Women, Politics, and Culture*, page 161 (2001): \"The question Hill's testimony placed before us was not whether Thomas was guilty of a legally actionable offense (she herself was unsure if his behavior added up to sexual harassment) but whether he belonged on the Supreme Court.\"\n150. **^** Segers, Grace (September 19, 2018). \"Here are some of the questions Anita Hill answered in 1991\".

He was nominated by President George H. W. Bush to succeed Thurgood Marshall and has served since 1991. After Marshall, Thomas is the second African American to serve on the Supreme Court and has been its longest-serving member since Anthony Kennedy's retirement in 2018. Since Stephen Breyer's retirement in 2022, he is also the Court's oldest member.\n\n\nThomas was born in Pin Point, Georgia. After his father abandoned the family, he was raised by his grandfather in a poor Gullah community near Savannah. Growing up as a devout Catholic, Thomas originally intended to be a priest in the Catholic Church but was frustrated over the church's insufficient attempts to combat racism. He abandoned his aspiration of becoming a clergyman to attend the College of the Holy Cross and, later Yale Law School, where he was influenced by a number of conservative authors, notably Thomas Sowell. Upon graduating, he was appointed as an assistant attorney general in Missouri and later entered private practice there. He became a legislative assistant to U.S. Senator John Danforth in 1979, and was made Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education in 1981. President Ronald Reagan appointed Thomas as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) the next year.\n\n\nPresident George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990. He served in that role for 19 months before filling Marshall's seat on the Supreme Court. Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed Anita Hill, a subordinate at the Department of Education and the EEOC.[5] Hill alleged that Thomas made multiple sexual and romantic overtures to her despite her repeatedly telling him to stop. Thomas and his supporters denied the allegation, asserting that Hill and her political supporters had fabricated the accusation to prevent the appointment of a black conservative. The Senate confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48, the narrowest margin in a century.[6]\n\n\nSince the death of Antonin Scalia, Thomas has been the Court's foremost originalist, stressing the original meaning in interpreting the Constitution.[7] In contrast to Scalia—who had been the only other consistent originalist—he pursues a more classically liberal variety of originalism.[8] Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments,[9] though has since begun asking more questions to counsel.[10] He is notable for his majority opinions in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School* (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment) and *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in *Gonzales v. Raich* (arguing that Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical marijuana). He is widely considered the Court's most conservative member.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nThomas was born on June 23, 1948, in his parents' wooden shack in Pin Point, Georgia.[11][12] Pin Point was a small community near Savannah founded by freedmen in the 1880s.[13] He was the second of three children of M. C. Thomas, a farm worker, and Leola Williams,[11] Myers Anderson's illegitimate daughter who, after her mother's death, had been sent from Liberty County, Georgia to live with an aunt in Pin Point.[14][15][16] His older sister Emma was born in 1946, his younger brother Myers in 1949.[17]\n\n\nThe family were descendants of enslaved people and spoke Gullah as a first language.[18] Thomas's earliest known ancestors were slaves named Sandy and Peggy, who were born in the late 18th century and owned by wealthy planter Josiah Wilson of Liberty County.[19]\n\n\n\nWhen Leola was pregnant with Thomas's older sister, she was expelled from her Baptist church and dropped out of high school after the 10th grade. Her father ordered her to marry M. C. in January 1947. They divorced in 1951.[17] M.C. moved to Savannah and later to Pennsylvania, visiting his children only once after the divorce. Custody of the children was awarded to Leola's aunt. Leola went to work as a maid in Savannah during the week, returning to Pin Point on the weekends. When the aunt's house burnt down in 1955, Leola took the boys to live with her in the room she rented in a tenement with an outdoor toilet in Savannah, leaving her daughter with the aunt in Pin Point.[20][21][22] Finding herself unable to raise two little boys by herself,[23] and unable to get public assistance because her father was wealthy,[22] she asked her father for help. He initially refused but agreed after his wife threatened to throw him out.[24][23]\n\n![](image)Thomas's 1967 high school yearbook pictureThomas and his brother went to live with Anderson and his wife in 1955 and experienced amenities such as indoor plumbing and regular meals for the first time.[25] Despite having little formal education, Anderson had built a successful business delivering coal, oil, and ice.[24] He converted to Catholicism, and sent Thomas to be educated at a series of segregated Catholic schools. Thomas attended the predominantly black St. Pius X High School in Chatham County[26] for two years before transferring to St. John Vianney's Minor Seminary on the Isle of Hope, where he was the segregated boarding school's first black student.[27][28] Though he experienced hazing, he performed well academically.[15] He spent many hours at the Carnegie Library, the only library for blacks in Savannah before libraries were desegregated in 1961.[29][30][32]\n\n\nWhen racial unrest led to widespread protest and marches in Savannah from 1960 to 1963, Anderson used his wealth to bail out demonstrators and took his grandchildren to meetings promoted by the NAACP.[33]\n\n\nWhen Thomas was ten years old, Anderson began putting his grandsons to work during the summers, helping him build a house on a plot of farmland he owned, building fences, and doing farm work.[34] He believed in hard work and self-reliance,[35] never showed his grandsons affection,[34] beat them frequently according to Leola, and impressed the importance of a good education on them.[36] Anderson taught Thomas that \"all of our rights as human beings came from God, not man\", and that racial segregation was a violation of divine law.[37]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nDuring his freshman year from 1967 to 1968, Thomas attended Conception Seminary College, a Catholic seminary in Missouri, with the intent to become a priest; no one in Thomas's family had attended college before.[38][27] After Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, he overheard a student say, \"Good. I hope the S.O.B. dies\" and \"[t]hat's what they should do to all the niggers\".[39][40][41] Thomas thought the church did not do enough to combat racism and resolved to abandon the priesthood.[42][39] He left the seminary at the end of the semester.[39]\n\n\nAt a nun's suggestion, Thomas enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross, an elite Catholic college in Massachusetts, as a sophomore transfer student on a full academic scholarship.[43][44] He was one of the college's first black students, being one of 20 recruited by President John E. Brooks in 1968 in a group that also included future attorney Ted Wells, running back Eddie Jenkins, Jr., and novelist Edward P. Jones.[45] Without financial support from his grandfather, Thomas defrayed his expenses by working as a waiter and dishwasher in the college's dining hall.[46][47] He later recalled, \"I was 19. My only hope was Holy Cross College\".[48]\n\n\n\nProfessors at Holy Cross remembered Thomas as a determined, diligent student. He kept to a strict routine of studying alone and stayed back during holidays to continue working.[49] Thomas C. Lawler, an English professor at Holy Cross,[50] recalled him as having \"never talked very much in class. He was the kind of person you really might not notice\".[51] By contrast, he was outspoken at BSU meetings, distinguishing himself as a contrarian who often feuded with Ted Wells. Future NFL running back Ed Jenkins, a BSU member, said Thomas \"could turn on a dime and reduce you to intellectual rubble\".[52][53] Edward P. Jones, who lived across from Thomas as a sophomore, reflected that \"there was a fierce determination I sensed from him [Thomas], that he was going to get as much as he could and get as far, ultimately, as he could\".[54] \n\n![](image)Dinand Library at the College of the Holy Cross, where Thomas studied for college[55]\nThomas became a vocal student activist as an undergraduate. He became acquainted with Black separatism, the Black Muslim Movement, the Black power movement, helped draft the Black Student Union (BSU), and displayed a poster of Malcolm X in his dormitory room.[56] When some black students were disproportionately punished in comparison with white students for the same violation, he suggested a walkout in protest. The BSU adopted his idea, and Thomas, along with 60 other black students, departed campus.[57][58] Some of the priests negotiated with the protesting black students to reenter the school.[27] When administrators granted amnesty to all protesters, Thomas returned to the college, later also to attend anti-war marches. In April 1970, he participated in the violent 1970 Harvard Square riots.[59] He has credited his protests for his turn toward conservatism and subsequent disillusionment with leftist movements.[60][61][54]\n\n\nHaving struggled with English as a native speaker of Gullah, Thomas chose to major in English literature.[46][62] He became a member of Alpha Sigma Nu, the Jesuit honor society, and the Purple Key Society, of which he was the only black member.[63] The college's focus on a liberal arts education introduced him to the works of black intellectuals such as Richard Wright, whose literary works Thomas sympathized with.[64] He also admired Malcolm X and recalled reading *The Autobiography of Malcolm X* to the point of wearing down the pages of his copy.[65]\n\n\nThomas graduated on June 4, 1971, with a Bachelor of Arts, *cum laude*,[63] ranked ninth in his class.[66][67] In his junior year, he was named a Fenwick Scholar, one of the highest honors at Holy Cross; in his senior year, he decided to pursue a career in law. Due to his academic achievements, he applied to and was accepted at Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[66][68] In 1971, Thomas matriculated at Yale Law School as one of 12 black students.[69] Yale offered him the best financial aid package, and he was attracted to the civil rights activism of some of its faculty members.[70][71] Finding it difficult to keep up with the school's expectations, he struggled to connect with other students who came from upper-class backgrounds. He enrolled in the most difficult courses and became a student of property law scholar Quintin Johnstone, who became his favorite professor.[72][73] Johnstone remembered Thomas as having \"performed very well\" and Dean Guido Calabresi described him and fellow student Hillary Clinton as \"both excellent students [who] had the same kind of reputation\".[74] He received several student deferments from the military draft with the classification 1-A after graduation, but failed the medical exam due to the curvature of his spine.[75]\n\n\nThomas obtained his Juris Doctor on May 20, 1974.[76] After graduation, he sought to enter private practice as a corporate lawyer in Atlanta, Georgia.[77] He has said that the law firms he applied to did not take his degree seriously, assuming he obtained it because of affirmative action.[78] According to Thomas, the law firms also \"asked pointed questions, unsubtly suggesting that they doubted I was as smart as my grades indicated\".[79] In his 2007 memoir, he wrote: \"I peeled a fifteen-cent sticker off a package of cigars and stuck it on the frame of my law degree to remind myself of the mistake I'd made by going to Yale. I never did change my mind about its value.\"[80]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas is sworn in as Assistant Secretary of Education for the Office for Civil Rights in 1981\nWith no job offers from major law firms, Thomas took a position as an associate with Missouri attorney general John Danforth, who offered him the prospect of practicing what he liked.[81] Thomas moved to Saint Louis to study for the Missouri bar, and was admitted on September 13, 1974.[82] He remained financially destitute even after leaving Yale, trying unsuccessfully on one occasion to make money by selling his blood at a blood bank, and hoped that by working for Danforth he might later acquire a job in private practice.[83][84]\n\n\nFrom 1974 to 1977, Thomas was an assistant attorney general of Missouri—the only African-American member of Danforth's staff. He worked first in the office's criminal appeals division and later in the revenue and taxation division. Thomas conducted lawsuits independently, gaining a reputation as a fair but controversial prosecutor.[85] Years later, after he joined the Supreme Court, Thomas recalled his position in Missouri as \"the best job I've ever had\".[86]\n\n\n\nWhen Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Thomas left to become an attorney in Monsanto's legal department in Saint Louis. He found the job unsatisfying, so left to rejoin Danforth in Washington, D.C., as a legislative assistant.[87] From 1979 to 1981, he handled energy issues for the Senate Commerce Committee. Thomas soon drew the attention of officials in the newly elected Reagan Administration as a Black conservative.[88] Pendleton James, Reagan's personnel director, offered Thomas the position of assistant secretary for civil rights at the U.S. Department of Education. Initially reluctant, Thomas agreed after Danforth and others pressed him to take the post.[89]\n\n![](image)Thomas in his office on May 18, 1981President Ronald Reagan nominated Thomas as assistant secretary of education for the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on May 1, 1981.[90][91] The Senate received the nomination on May 28, 1981, and Thomas was quickly confirmed before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on June 19, succeeding Cynthia Brown at the age of 32.[92][93] He held the position for a brief period before James offered him a new position as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a promotion that Thomas believed, as with his position in the OCR, was because of his race.[94] After James consulted the President, Thomas hesitantly took up the chair with Reagan's approval.[95]\n\n\nThomas chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) from 1982 to 1990. As chairman, he was tasked with enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in an agency that had been mutually resented by both Democrats and Republicans. He announced a reorganization of the EEOC and upgraded its record-keeping under an uncompromising leadership that eschewed racial quotas.[94][96] Concerned by the EEOC's limited statutory authority, Thomas sought to impose criminal penalties for employers who practiced employment discrimination, moving to shift funding towards agency investigators. Though he had been critical of affirmative action, Thomas also opposed the Reagan Administration's agenda to remove affirmative action policies, believing it to be a detraction from socioeconomic issues.[97][98]\n\n\nDuring Thomas's tenure, settlement award amounts to victims of discrimination tripled, while the number of suits filed decreased. The EEOC's lack of the use of goals and timetables drew criticism from civil rights advocates, who lobbied representatives to review the EEOC's practices; Thomas testified before Congress more than 50 times. Near the end of his final term, the EEOC came under congressional scrutiny for the mishandling of age-discrimination cases.[99][100]\n\n\n\n## District of Columbia Court of Appeals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas with President Ronald Reagan in 1986, while serving as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity CommissionIn early 1989, President George H. W. Bush expressed interest in nominating Thomas to a federal judgeship. Thomas, now at age 41, initially rejected the position, believing himself unready to make a lifetime commitment to being a judge. White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu advocated for his nomination, and Judge Laurence Silberman advised Thomas to accept an appointment.[101] Anticipating Thomas's nomination, a liberal coalition—including the Alliance for Justice and the National Organization for Women (NOW)—emerged to oppose his candidacy.[102]\n\n\nOn October 30, 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to fill the seat vacated by Robert Bork.[103][104] Thomas gained the support of other African American officials, including former transportation secretary William Coleman, and said that when meeting white Democratic staffers in the United States Senate, he was \"struck by how easy it had become for sanctimonious whites to accuse a black man of not caring about civil rights\".[65]\n\n\nIn February 1990, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Thomas by a vote of 12 to 1. On March 6, 1990, the Senate confirmed him to the Court of Appeals by a vote of 98 to 2.[102] He developed cordial relationships during his 19 months on the federal court, including with Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[65] During his judgeship, Thomas authored 19 opinions.[105]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Thomas was nominated to replace Justice Thurgood Marshall (*pictured*), who announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, due to ill health. Marshall would later give advice to Thomas after the confirmation.[106][107]\nWhen Justice William Brennan retired from the Supreme Court in July 1990, Thomas was Bush's favorite among the five candidates on his shortlist for the position. However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[108] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[109][110] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[111]\n\n\nLiberal interest groups sought to challenge Thomas's nomination by paralleling the same strategy used against Robert Bork's confirmation.[112] Abortion-rights groups, including the National Abortion Rights Action League and the NOW, were concerned that Thomas would be among those to overrule *Roe v. Wade*.[113] Republican officials in turn emphasized his personal history and gathered support from African American interest groups, including the NAACP.[114] Other civil rights organizations, such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Urban League, were convinced not to oppose Thomas, believing that he was Bush's last black nominee. On July 31, 1991, the board of directors of the NAACP voted against endorsing Thomas, announcing their opposition to his confirmation the same day.[115]\n\n\nThe American Bar Association (ABA) appraised Thomas as \"qualified\" for the Supreme Court.[116][a] The Bush Administration anticipated that the organization would rate Thomas more poorly than it thought he deserved, so pressured the ABA for at least the mid-level qualified rating while simultaneously discrediting it as partisan.[119] The ABA did rate Thomas as qualified, although with one of the lowest levels of support for a Supreme Court nominee.[120][121] It gave its highest rankings to Thomas in integrity and judicial temperament, and a mid-grade in professional competence.[122]\n\n\nOn September 10, 1991, formal confirmation hearings began before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[123][124] Thomas testified for 25 hours, the second-longest of any Supreme Court nominee.[125] He was reticent when answering senators' questions, recalling what had happened to Robert Bork when Bork expounded on his judicial philosophy during his confirmation hearings four years earlier.[126] As many of his earlier writings frequently referenced natural law, his views on the legal theory became a focus of the hearings. Thomas said he regarded natural law as a \"philosophical background\" to the Constitution.[127][128][129]\n\n\nNinety witnesses testified in favor of or against Thomas.[130] On September 27, 1991, the Judiciary Committee voted 13–1 to send his nomination to the full Senate without recommendation. A motion earlier in the day to give the nomination a favorable recommendation had failed, 7–7,[131] forwarding it to a full Senate vote.[130][132]\n\n\n\n### Anita Hill accusations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Clarence Thomas Opening StatementOctober 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Anita Hill Opening StatementOctober 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Thomas Second Hearing Day 1, Part 1October 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Thomas Second Hearing Day 1, Part 2October 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the committee's confirmation hearings, the Senate was debating whether to give final approval to Thomas's nomination. An FBI interview with Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas at the EEOC, was soon leaked to the press and allegations of sexual harassment followed.[133][134] As a result, on October 8, the final vote was postponed, and the confirmation hearings were reopened. It was only the third time in the Senate's history that such an action was taken and the first since 1925, when Justice Harlan F. Stone's nomination was recommitted to the Judiciary Committee.[132]\n\n\n\nHill was raised in Oklahoma and, like Thomas, graduated from Yale Law School.[135] She told James Brudney, a fellow Yale alumnus, about alleged sexual advances Thomas had made, telling him that she also did not wish to testify or make the allegations public to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Hill requested to the staff of Senator Joe Biden, the chair of the committee, that her allegations be made anonymously if she chose to testify and that Thomas not be informed of them, which Biden declined. Hill then notified Democratic staffers the day after the hearings had ended that she wished to make her allegations known to the committee.[136]\n\n![](image)Hill testifying during the second confirmation hearingsHill's allegations were corroborated by Susan Hoerchner, a judge in California, who also wished to remain anonymous.[137][138] Hoerchner called Harriet Grant, a chief counsel to Biden, to inform him of her allegations. She recalled that Thomas told Hill in an elevator at the EEOC that he would ruin her career if she spoke about his behavior.[139] When Grant told Hill and Hoerchner that the FBI would be involved, they were reluctant to be investigated. Hill declined to speak with the FBI, as she feared it would misconstrue her words, so instead arranged to deliver a written statement. The statement described how Thomas pressured her to date him, and included descriptions of him speaking about sexual interests involving pornographic films.[140] Hill also alleged that Thomas spoke of sex at work despite her being uncomfortable with the subject, adding, \"I sensed that my discomfort with his discussions only urged him on, as though my reaction of feeling ill at ease and vulnerable was what he wanted\".[141] The FBI report of its investigation was not made public. The White House announced that the FBI had found the allegations \"without foundation\". Congressional officials who had seen the report told the *New York Times* that \"the bureau could not draw any conclusion because of the 'he said, she said' nature of the subject\".[142][143] The use of the FBI was contentious in the Judiciary Committee because it answers to the president, who was sponsoring Thomas. Biden used the FBI instead of the committee's investigators to avoid the appearance of partisanship.[144]\n\n\n#### Second hearing[edit]\n\n\nThe hearings reconvened on October 11, 1991. Thomas was scheduled to go first, followed by a questioning of Hill by the committee.[145] He denied that he had said or done anything to Hill \"that could have been mistaken for sexual harassment\" and said that he would not answer any questions about his private life so as not to \"provide the rope for my own lynching\".[146]\n\n\nHill then testified for seven hours that ten years earlier Thomas had subjected her to comments of a sexual nature, calling it \"behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court\".[147][148][149] Her testimony included graphic details, and some senators questioned her aggressively.[150][151] Hill accused Thomas of making two sexually offensive remarks to her: comparing his penis to that of Long Dong Silver, a black porn star, and saying he had discovered a pubic hair on his Coca-Cola can.[152][153]\n\n\n\n> \n> And from my standpoint as a black American, as far as I'm concerned, [this proceeding] is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks that in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to the old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the United States Senate rather than hung from a tree.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThomas, testifying as part of his opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee[154]\n\nIn the evening, Thomas was recalled before the committee. He again denied the allegations and was prompted by Senator Orrin Hatch's questioning to launch a speech that criticized the proceeding as a \"high-tech lynching for uppity blacks\".[155] The speech resonated with Southern blacks and stimulated Thomas's supporters,[156] with public opinion shifting in his favor afterward.[157][158]\n\n\nHill was the only person to publicly testify that Thomas had sexually harassed her.[159] Angela Wright, who worked under Thomas at the EEOC and had alleged that \"Thomas had continually pressured her to date him and made sexual comments about women's bodies\",[160][161] and a corroborating witness she had named were not called to testify.[160] Their written depositions were entered into the congressional records unrebutted.[162][163][164] Sukari Hardnett, a former Thomas assistant, wrote to the Senate committee that although Thomas had not harassed her, \"If you were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being inspected and auditioned as a female.\"[165]\n\n\nIn addition to Hill and Thomas, the committee heard from several other witnesses over October 11–13.[132] A former colleague, Nancy Altman, who shared an office with Thomas at the Department of Education, testified that she heard virtually everything Thomas said over the course of two years and never heard a sexist or offensive comment from him. Altman did not find it credible that Thomas could have engaged in the conduct Hill alleged without any of the dozens of women he worked with noticing it.[166] Senator Alan K. Simpson, a member of the committee, asked why Hill met, dined with, and spoke by phone with Thomas on various occasions after they no longer worked together.[167][168] After the confirmation hearings ended, the event became a focus of divided scholarship, with authors who revisited it reaching varying conclusions.[158]\n\n\n\n### Senate votes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas was sworn in as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court by Justice Byron White on October 23, 1991. His wife, Virginia Thomas, looks on in the foreground.On October 15, 1991, the Senate voted to confirm Thomas as an associate justice, 52–48.[132] Thomas received the votes of 41 Republicans and 11 Democrats, while 46 Democrats and two Republicans voted to reject his nomination.[169]\n\n\nThe 99 days during which Thomas's nomination was pending in the Senate was the second-longest of the 16 nominees receiving a final vote since 1975, second only to Bork's 108 days.[132] The vote to confirm Thomas was the narrowest margin for approval in more than 100 years.[170]\n\n\nThomas received his commission on October 23 and took the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, becoming the Court's 106th justice.[171][b] He was sworn in by Justice Byron White in a ceremony initially scheduled for October 21, which was postponed because of the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist's wife, Natalie.[173][174][175] His first set of law clerks included future judges Gregory Katsas and Gregory Maggs and U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau.[176][177]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Vote to confirm the Thomas nomination\n |\n| --- |\n| October 15, 1991\n | Party\n | Total votes\n |\n| Democratic | Republican |\n| **Yea** | **11** | **41** | **52** |\n| Nay\n | 46\n | 02\n | 48\n |\n| **Result: Confirmed** |\n\n\n## Supreme Court of the United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official portrait, 2004\nAfter joining the Supreme Court, Thomas emerged as a member of the Court's conservative wing.[178] He aligned himself with Justice Antonin Scalia, with whom he shared an originalist approach to constitutional interpretation, and sided with him in 92 percent of cases during his first 13 years on the bench.[c] Over time, Thomas and Scalia's jurisprudence separated,[d] with Thomas favoring stronger emphasis on the Constitution's original understanding and demonstrating greater willingness to overrule precedent.[186] His appointment represented a decline in the Court's liberal wing, which then comprised only Justices John Paul Stevens and Harry Blackmun.[187][188]\n\n\nIn his early days on the Court, Thomas adopted a bold style of legal jurisprudence that alienated him from Justices Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor. He became the subject of intense media criticism for his decisions, including from figures that supported his appointment. Having previously experienced scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, Thomas believed in producing results without regard for his public image, a characteristic which embodied his lack of questions during oral arguments. His conservative approach moved O'Connor to take liberal positions but attracted Scalia. He formed a friendship with Justice Byron White, with whom he shared multiple interests, and found support from Justice David Souter.[189][190]\n\n\nThomas is a proponent of original meaning, incorporating what had been Scalia's narrower approach to the doctrine and the original intent of the Framers of the Constitution, including those espoused in the Declaration of Independence. As a means to impartiality, he is an advocate of judicial restraint to limit judicial discretion.[191][e] Thomas has been the most-willing of all justices on the Court to overrule precedent; according to Scalia, \"he does not believe in *stare decisis*, period\".[194][195][f] By October 1, 2012, he had written 475 opinions, including 171 majority opinions, 138 concurrences, and 166 dissenting opinions—approximately 10 percent of the 1,772 cases the Court had decided since he was elevated.[197] In 2016, Thomas wrote nearly twice as many opinions as any other justice.[9]\n\n\nThomas has been called the most conservative member of the Supreme Court,[190][198][199] though others gave Scalia that designation while they served on the Court together.[200][201] Thomas's influence, particularly among conservatives, was perceived to have significantly increased during Donald Trump's presidency,[202][203] and Trump appointed many of his former clerks to political positions and judgeships.[204][205][206] As the Supreme Court became more conservative, Thomas and his legal views became more influential on the Court.[207][208][209] This influence increased further by 2022, with Thomas authoring an opinion expanding Second Amendment rights and contributing to the Court's overruling of *Roe v. Wade*. He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[210][211][212]\n\n\n\n### Government powers and legal structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Court precedent[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Stare decisis in the U.S. legal system\n![](image)The Roberts Court in 2006Thomas believes the Court should not follow erroneous precedent, a view not currently held by other justices.[213] He has called to reconsider *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan* (1964), and criticized *Roe v. Wade* (1973) and *Gideon v. Wainwright* (1963). At a 2013 Federalist Society dinner, Judge Diane S. Sykes asked Thomas whether \"*stare decisis* doesn't hold much force for you?\" He responded, \"Oh, it sure does, but not enough to keep me from going to the Constitution\".[214][215] In 2019, *The New York Times* reported that data gathered by political scientist Stephen L. Wasby of the University at Albany found that Thomas wrote \"more than 250 concurring or dissenting opinions seriously questioning precedents, calling for their reconsideration or suggesting that they be overruled\".[214]\n\n\n\nIn the 2010 gun regulation case *McDonald v. City of Chicago*, Thomas sought to repeal past precedents and insisted that \"*stare decisis* is only an 'adjunct' of our duty as judges to decide by our best lights what the Constitution means\".[216] In *Gamble v. United States* (2019), he joined the majority opinion, which revisited an exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause, writing separately to state his position against the Court's prevailing view of multi-factor analysis regarding whether to follow precedent:[217]\n\n\n> In my view, if the Court encounters a decision that is demonstrably erroneous—i.e., one that is not a permissible interpretation of the text—the Court should correct the error, regardless of whether other factors support overruling the precedent. Federal courts may (but need not) adhere to an incorrect decision as precedent, but only when traditional tools of legal interpretation show that the earlier decision adopted a textually permissible interpretation of the law. A demonstrably incorrect judicial decision, by contrast, is tantamount to making law, and adhering to it both disregards the supremacy of the Constitution and perpetuates a usurpation of the legislative power.[218]\n> \n> \n\nIn *Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt* (2019),[g] Thomas wrote the 5–4 decision overruling *Nevada v. Hall* (1979), which said states could be sued in courts of other states. In his majority opinion, he noted that *stare decisis* \"is not an inexorable command\". Thomas explicitly disavowed the concept of reliance interests as justification for adhering to precedent. In dissent from *Hyatt III*, Justice Breyer asked what other decisions might eventually be overruled, and suggested *Roe v. Wade* might be among them. Breyer stated that it is best to leave precedents alone unless they are widely seen as erroneous or become impractical.[219]\n\n\n#### Executive power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas speaks with Akhil Reed Amar of the Constitutional Accountability Center in 2012\nThomas has supported a broad interpretation of executive power and has theorized about its constitutional aspects.[9] In *Hamdi v. Rumsfeld* (2004),[h] he dissented from the majority opinion, arguing that courts should have had complete deference to the executive decision to determine that Yaser Esam Hamdi was an enemy combatant.[220] He wrote in *Hamdi* that the president does not have the singular authority to detain a citizen who was captured while in enemy service.[221] In addition, Thomas noted that \"structural advantages [of the Presidency] are most important in the national-security and foreign-affairs contexts\" and thus \"the Founders intended that the President have primary responsibility—along with the necessary power—to protect the national security and to conduct the nation's foreign relations\".[222]\n\n\nThomas was one of three justices to dissent in *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* (2006),[i] which concerned whether the president can establish military tribunals to try detained enemy combatants for war crimes conspiracy. As in *Hamdi*, he relied on *The Federalist Papers* in proposing that the president is responsible for protecting national security.[223][224]\n\n\nIn *Zivotofsky v. Kerry* (2015), Thomas relied on the Articles of Confederation for his opinion. He wrote, \"the President is not confined to those powers expressly identified in [the Constitution]\", concluding that residual foreign affairs were vested in the president, not Congress.[225] Rather than finding the original intent or original understanding, Thomas wrote in the case that he sought the \"understanding of executive power [that] prevailed in America\" at the time of the founding.[226]\n\n\nIn the Ninth Circuit case *East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump* (2018), which placed an injunction on the Trump administration's asylum policy, Thomas dissented from a denial of stay application. The Ninth Circuit imposed an injunction on the Trump administration's policy granting asylum only to refugees entering from a designated port of entry, ruling that it violated the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Ninth Circuit Judge Jay Bybee's majority opinion concluded that denial of the ability to apply for asylum regardless of entry point is \"the hollowest of rights that an alien must be allowed to apply for asylum regardless of whether she arrived through a port of entry if another rule makes her categorically ineligible for asylum based on precisely that fact.\" Gorsuch, Alito, Kavanaugh also dissented in the decision to deny a stay to the Ninth Circuit's injunction.[227][228]\n\n\n\n#### Federalism[edit]\n\n\nThomas views federalism as a foundational limit on federal power.[229] In interpreting congressional powers, he has defended strict constructionism—an approach Scalia rejected.[230] On September 24, 1999, Thomas delivered the Dwight D. Opperman Lecture at Drake University Law School on \"Why Federalism Matters\", saying that it was an essential safeguard to protect \"individual liberty and the private ordering of our lives\". He also asserted that federalism enhances self-government, protects individual liberty by separating political power, and checks federal authority.[231] According to law professor Ann Althouse, the Court has yet to move toward \"the broader, more principled version of federalism propounded by Justice Thomas\".[232]\n\n> \n> Nothing in the Constitution deprives the people of each State of the power to prescribe eligibility requirements for the candidates who seek to represent them in Congress. The Constitution is simply silent on this question. And where the Constitution is silent, it raises no bar to action by the States or the people.\n> \n> \n> — Thomas, dissenting in *U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton* (1995)[233][229]\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nIn the 1995 case *U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton*,[j] parties challenged the constitutionality of an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution that added age, citizenship, and residency requirements for congressional service. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the amendment unconstitutional, also affirming the previous rulings of both the state's trial court and the Arkansas Supreme Court; Justice Stevens wrote for the majority. Thomas—joined by Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, and Scalia—dissented in what is to date his lengthiest opinion.[234] He argued that states could impose term limits on members of Congress, as state citizens are \"the ultimate source of the Constitution's authority\".[235] That same year, Thomas concurred in *United States v. Lopez*, which invalidated the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 for going beyond the Commerce Clause. He opined that the Court had deviated \"from the original understanding of the Commerce Clause\" and that the substantial effects test, \"if taken to its logical extreme, would give Congress a 'police power' over all aspects of American life\".[236]\n\n\nThomas dissented in *Gonzales v. Raich* (2005), which held that the Controlled Substances Act applies to homegrown marijuana, on the grounds of original meaning.[237] His interpretation of the interstate commerce clause differed from Scalia's, and they also held conflicting beliefs about the general welfare clause, the Indian commerce clause, and the necessary and proper clause. Scalia joined the majority opinion, but Thomas disputed the relevance of homegrown marijuana to interstate commerce, writing that if Congress can regulate it, \"it can regulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers\".[238][239]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Comstock* (2010),[k] the Supreme Court, in a majority opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, held that the Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to enact a law that authorized the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to detain a mentally ill and dangerous federal prisoner beyond the DOJ's original lawful date. Thomas's dissent, joined by Scalia, argued that the clause allows Congress only to execute enumerated powers.[240] When the Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* (2012), he authored a short dissent and joined the joint dissent finding the act completely unconstitutional.[241]\n\n\n\n#### Federal statutes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas Swears in Sonny Perdue as the 31st Secretary of Agriculture, 2017As of 2007, Thomas was the justice most willing to exercise judicial review of federal statutes but among the least likely to overturn state statutes.[242] According to a *New York Times* editorial, \"from 1994 to 2005 ... Justice Thomas voted to overturn federal laws in 34 cases and Justice Scalia in 31, compared with just 15 for Justice Stephen Breyer\".[243]\n\n\nIn *Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder*, Thomas was the sole dissenter, voting to throw out Section Five of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Section Five requires states with a history of racial voter discrimination—mostly states from the old South—to gain Justice Department clearance when revising election procedures. Congress had reauthorized Section Five in 2006 for another 25 years, but Thomas said the law was no longer necessary, stating that the rate of black voting in seven Section Five states was higher than the national average. He wrote, \"the violence, intimidation and subterfuge that led Congress to pass Section 5 and this court to uphold it no longer remains.\"[244] He took this position again in *Shelby County v. Holder*, voting with the majority and concurring with the reasoning that struck down Section Five.[245]\n\n\n\n### Individual rights[edit]\n\n\n#### Free speech and expression[edit]\n\n\nThomas has generally written opinions in favor of protections for free speech.[246][247] He has voted in favor of First Amendment claims in cases involving issues including campaign contributions and commercial speech.[248] A 2002 study by Eugene Volokh found Thomas to be the justice second-most likely to uphold free speech claims (tied with Souter).[249] He has ruled against laws regulating hate speech, as in *R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul* (1992), *United States v. Stevens* (2010), and *Snyder v. Phelps* (2011).[250] Conversely, he has been reluctant to uphold speech deemed intimidating, as in *Virginia v. Black* (2003).[251][252]\n\n\nThomas's first opinion on free speech was the 1995 case *McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission*,[l] finding that the Founding Era contained the expansive use of anonymous pamphlets and columns. Although he agreed with the result of Justice John Paul Stevens's majority opinion, he disagreed with its methodology and did not join it.[253] With the announcement of *McIntyre*, the Court also decided *Rubin v. Coors Brewing Company*, in which Thomas wrote his first majority opinion concerning free speech. In *Rubin*, Thomas was joined unanimously in ruling unconstitutional a 1935 federal law that prohibited beer labels from disclosing alcohol content. He similarly concurred the next year in *44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island*, which struck down a state law that banned the advertisement of prices of alcoholic beverages.[254]\n\n\n\nIn *Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC* (1996), the Supreme Court ruled against the decision of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to fine the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee for running a political advertisement targeting Senator Tim Wirth. Thomas joined Justice Stephen Breyer's majority opinion in the case, but wrote separately to call against the framework established in the previous campaign finance case of *Buckley v Valeo* (1976):\n\n\n> I believe that contribution limits infringe as directly and as seriously upon freedom of political expression and association as do expenditure limits. The protections of the First Amendment do not depend upon so fine a line as that between spending money to support a candidate or group and giving money to the candidate or group to spend for the same purpose. In principle, people and groups give money to candidates and other groups for the same reason that they spend money in support of those candidates and groups: because they share social, economic, and political beliefs and seek to have those beliefs affect governmental policy.[255]\n> \n> \n\n![](image)The Roberts Court pictured in 2017Thomas has made public his belief that all limits on federal campaign contributions are unconstitutional and should be struck down.[256] In *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010), Thomas joined the majority but dissented in part, arguing that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act's disclaimer and disclosure requirements were unconstitutional. He reinforced his defense of anonymous speech in *Doe v. Reed* (2010), writing that the First Amendment protects \"political association\" by means of signing a petition.[257]\n\nIn *Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District* (1969), Justice Hugo Black dissented from the Court's opinion invalidating a school's policy to forbid students from wearing armbands in protest of the Vietnam War. Thomas endorsed Black's dissent in *Morse v. Frederick* (2007), concurring with narrowing the rationale of *Tinker* and arguing that *Tinker* be overruled as it was a constitutionally unsupported \"sea change in students’ speech rights\".[258] In his view, the Constitution does not govern whether public school students may be disciplined for expressive behavior.[259]\n\n\nIn *Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L.*—in which a high school punished a student for sending a profane message on social media about her school, softball team, and cheer team—Thomas was the lone dissenter, siding with the school. He criticized the majority for relying on \"vague considerations\" and wrote that historically schools could discipline students in similar situations.[260] In *Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans*, he joined the majority opinion that Texas's decision to deny a request for a Confederate Battle Flag specialty license plate was constitutional.[261]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas speaks at the Library of Congress in September 2012\nThomas agreed with the judgment in *McDonald v. Chicago* (2010) that the right to keep and bear arms is applicable to state and local governments, but he wrote a separate concurrence finding that an individual's right to bear arms is fundamental as a privilege of American citizenship under the Privileges or Immunities Clause rather than as a fundamental right under the due process clause.[262] The four justices in the plurality opinion specifically rejected incorporation under the privileges or immunities clause, \"declin[ing] to disturb\" the holding in the *Slaughter-House Cases*, which, according to the plurality, had held that the clause applied only to federal matters.[263][264]\n\n\nSince 2010, Thomas has dissented from denial of certiorari in several Second Amendment cases. He voted to grant certiorari in *Friedman v. City of Highland Park* (2015), which upheld bans on certain semi-automatic rifles; *Jackson v. San Francisco* (2014), which upheld trigger lock ordinances similar to those struck down in *Heller*; *Peruta v. San Diego County* (2016), which upheld restrictive concealed carry licensing in California; and *Silvester v. Becerra* (2017), which upheld waiting periods for firearm purchasers who have already passed background checks and already own firearms. He was joined by Scalia in the first two cases, and by Gorsuch in *Peruta*.[265][266][267][268]\n\n\nThomas dissented from the denial of an application for a stay presented to Chief Justice Roberts in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit case *Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives* (2019), a case challenging the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks. Only Thomas and Gorsuch publicly dissented.[269]\n\n\nThomas authored the majority opinion in *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (2022), guaranteeing the right of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms in public. The case held: \"When the Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's 'unqualified command.'\" Justice Stephen Breyer, dissenting, wrote, \"when courts interpret the Second Amendment, it is constitutionally proper, indeed often necessary, for them to consider the serious dangers and consequences of gun violence that lead States to regulate firearms.\"\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas with U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson, 2007\nIn cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, Thomas often favors police over defendants. For example, his opinion for the Court in *Board of Education v. Earls* upheld drug testing for students involved in extracurricular activities, and he wrote again for the Court in *Samson v. California*, permitting random searches on parolees. He dissented in *Georgia v. Randolph*, which prohibited warrantless searches that one resident approves and the other opposes, arguing that the Court's decision in *Coolidge v. New Hampshire* controlled the case. In *Indianapolis v. Edmond*, Thomas described the Court's extant case law as having held that \"suspicionless roadblock seizures are constitutionally permissible if conducted according to a plan that limits the discretion of the officers conducting the stops.\" He expressed doubt that those cases were decided correctly but concluded that since the litigants in the case at bar had not briefed or argued that the earlier cases be overruled, he believed that the Court should assume their validity and rule accordingly.[270] Thomas was in the majority in *Kyllo v. United States*, which held that the use of thermal imaging technology to probe a suspect's home without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\nIn cases involving schools, Thomas has advocated greater respect for the doctrine of *in loco parentis*,[271] which he defines as \"parents delegat[ing] to teachers their authority to discipline and maintain order\".[272] His dissent in *Safford Unified School District v. Redding* illustrates his application of this postulate in the Fourth Amendment context. School officials in the *Safford* case had a reasonable suspicion that 13-year-old Savana Redding was illegally distributing prescription-only drugs. All the justices concurred that it was therefore reasonable for the school officials to search Redding, and the main issue before the Court was only whether the search went too far by becoming a strip search or the like.[272] All the justices except Thomas concluded that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The majority required a finding of danger or reason to believe drugs were hidden in a student's underwear in order to justify a strip search. Thomas wrote, \"It is a mistake for judges to assume the responsibility for deciding which school rules are important enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules are not\"[273] and \"reasonable suspicion that Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of these policies, therefore, justified a search extending to any area where small pills could be concealed\". He added, \"[t]here can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to conduct the search.\"[272]\n\n\n\n#### Sixth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nIn *Doggett v. United States*, the defendant had technically been a fugitive from the time he was indicted in 1980 until his arrest in 1988. The Court held that the delay between indictment and arrest violated Doggett's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, finding that the government had been negligent in pursuing him and that he was unaware of the indictment.[274] Thomas dissented, arguing that the Speedy Trial Clause's purpose was to prevent \"'undue and oppressive incarceration' and the 'anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation'\" and that the case implicated neither.[274] He cast the case instead as \"present[ing] the question [of] whether, independent of these core concerns, the Speedy Trial Clause protects an accused from two additional harms: (1) prejudice to his ability to defend himself caused by the passage of time; and (2) disruption of his life years after the alleged commission of his crime\". Thomas dissented from the court's decision to, as he saw it, answer the former in the affirmative.[274] He wrote that dismissing the conviction \"invites the Nation's judges to indulge in ad hoc and result-driven second guessing of the government's investigatory efforts. Our Constitution neither contemplates nor tolerates such a role\".[275]\n\n\nIn *Garza v. Idaho*, Thomas and Gorsuch, in dissent, suggested that *Gideon v. Wainwright* (1963), which required that indigent criminal defendants be provided counsel, was wrongly decided and should be overruled.[214]\n\n\n\n##### Eighth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nThomas was among the dissenters in *Atkins v. Virginia* and *Roper v. Simmons*, which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the application of the death penalty to certain classes of persons. In *Kansas v. Marsh*, his opinion for the Court indicated a belief that the Constitution affords states broad procedural latitude in imposing the death penalty, provided they remain within the limits of *Furman v. Georgia* and *Gregg v. Georgia*, the 1976 case in which the Court reversed its 1972 ban on death sentences if states followed procedural guidelines.[*citation needed*]\n\n![](image)Thomas speaking to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue in 2017\nIn *Hudson v. McMillian*, a prisoner had been beaten, sustaining a cracked lip, broken dental plate, loosened teeth, cuts, and bruises. Although these were not \"serious injuries\", the Court believed, it held that \"the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury.\"[276] Dissenting, Thomas wrote, \"a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the Court today goes far beyond our precedents.\"[276] Thomas's vote—in one of his first cases after joining the Court—was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion).[277] His opinion was criticized by the seven-member majority, which wrote that, by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, it ignored \"the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment\".[276] According to historian David Garrow, Thomas's dissent in *Hudson* was a \"classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him\".[278] Thomas later responded to the accusation \"that I supported the beating of prisoners in that case. Well, one must either be illiterate or fraught with malice to reach that conclusion ... no honest reading can reach such a conclusion.\"[278]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Bajakajian*, Thomas joined with the Court's liberal justices to write the majority opinion declaring a fine unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The fine was for failing to declare more than $300,000 in a suitcase on an international flight. Under a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), the passenger would have had to forfeit the entire amount. Thomas noted that the case required a distinction to be made between civil forfeiture and a fine exacted with the intention of punishing the respondent. He found that the forfeiture in this case was clearly intended as a punishment at least in part, was \"grossly disproportional\" and violated the Excessive Fines Clause.[279]\n\n\nThomas has written that the \"Cruel and Unusual Punishment\" clause \"contains no proportionality principle\", meaning that the question whether a sentence should be rejected as \"cruel and unusual\" depends only on the sentence itself, not on what crime is being punished.[280] He was concurring with the Court's decision to reject a request for review from a petitioner who had been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison under California's \"Three-Strikes\" law for stealing some golf clubs because the combined value of the clubs made the theft a felony and he had two previous felonies in his criminal record.\n\n\n\n#### Race, equal protection, and affirmative action[edit]\n\n\nThomas believes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of race, such as race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment. In *Adarand Constructors v. Peña*, he wrote, \"there is a 'moral [and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That [affirmative action] programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race.\"[281]\n\n\nIn *Gratz v. Bollinger*, Thomas wrote, \"a State's use of racial discrimination in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.\"[282] In *Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1*, Thomas joined the opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, who wrote that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"[283] Concurring, Thomas wrote, \"if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories\", and charged that the dissent carried \"similarities\" to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in *Brown v. Board of Education*.[283]\n\n\nLikewise, in *Grutter v. Bollinger*, Thomas approvingly quoted Justice Harlan's *Plessy v. Ferguson* dissent: \"Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\"[284] In a concurrence in *Missouri v. Jenkins* (1995), he wrote that the Missouri District Court \"has read our cases to support the theory that black students suffer an unspecified psychological harm from segregation that retards their mental and educational development. This approach not only relies upon questionable social science research rather than constitutional principle, but it also rests on an assumption of black inferiority.\"[285]\n\n\nSome legal scholars have called Thomas's views on race and the constitution \"idiosyncratic\",[286] \"pessimistic\", or \"fatalistic\".[287] For example, professors Corey Robin and Stephen F. Smith have characterized Thomas's philosophy as grounded in a form of black nationalism that sees governmental attempts to address racism as either futile or counterproductive.[287][288][289][290] That view contrasts with the belief that laws should be race-neutral because racial discrimination is no longer a serious problem in the United States.[286]\n\n\nThomas joined the majority in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard*, which struck down affirmative action in college admissions. He filed a concurring opinion, which he read from the bench, a rare practice for Supreme Court justices.[291]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion and family planning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justice Thomas administers the oath of office to Amy Coney Barrett (Oct 26, 2020)\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Casey* (1992), the Court reaffirmed *Roe v. Wade*. Thomas and Justice Byron White joined the dissenting opinions of Rehnquist and Scalia. Rehnquist wrote, \"[w]e believe *Roe* was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to *stare decisis* in constitutional cases.\"[293] Scalia's opinion concluded that the right to obtain an abortion is not \"a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States\".[293] \"[T]he Constitution says absolutely nothing about it,\" Scalia wrote, \"and [ ] the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed\".[293]\n\n\nIn *Stenberg v. Carhart* (2000), the Court struck down a state ban on partial-birth abortion, concluding that it failed *Casey*'s \"undue burden\" test. Thomas dissented, writing, \"Although a State *may* permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State *must* do so.\"[294][*citation needed*] He went on to criticize the reasoning of the *Casey* and *Stenberg* majorities: \"The majority's insistence on a health exception is a fig leaf barely covering its hostility to any abortion regulation by the States—a hostility that *Casey* purported to reject.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Gonzales v. Carhart* (2007), the Court rejected a facial challenge to a federal ban on partial-birth abortion.[295][*citation needed*] Concurring, Thomas asserted that the court's abortion jurisprudence had no basis in the Constitution but that the court had accurately applied that jurisprudence in rejecting the challenge.[295][*citation needed*] He added that the Court was not deciding the question of whether Congress had the power to outlaw partial-birth abortions: \"[W]hether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court [in this case] ... the parties did not raise or brief that issue; it is outside the question presented; and the lower courts did not address it.\"[295][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Thomas dissented when the Court voted not to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.[296] Alito and Gorsuch joined Thomas's dissent, arguing that the Court was \"abdicating its judicial duty\".[297]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Thomas joined three of the Court's other conservative justices in voting to reject a stay to temporarily block a law restricting abortion in Louisiana.[298] The law that the court temporarily stayed, in a 5–4 decision, would have required that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a hospital.[299]\n\n\nIn *Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc.* (2019), a per curiam decision upholding the provision of Indiana's abortion restriction regarding fetal remains disposal on rational basis scrutiny and upholding the lower court rulings striking down the provision banning race, sex, and disability, Thomas wrote a concurring opinion comparing abortion and birth control to eugenics, which was practiced in the U.S. in the early 20th century and by the Nazi government in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, and comparing *Box* to *Buck v. Bell* (1927), which upheld a forced sterilization law regarding people with mental disabilities. In his opinion, Thomas quoted Margaret Sanger's support for contraception as a form of personal reproductive control that she considered superior to \"the horrors of abortion and infanticide\" (Sanger's words).[300][*citation needed*] His opinion referred several times to historian/journalist Adam Cohen's book *Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck*; shortly afterward, Cohen published a sharply worded criticism saying that Thomas had misinterpreted his book and misunderstood the history of the eugenics movement.[301] In *Box*, only Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ginsburg publicly registered their votes. Ginsburg and Sotomayor concurred in part and dissented in part, stating they would have upheld the lower court decision on striking down the race, sex, and disability ban as well as the lower court decision striking down the fetal remains disposal provision.[300][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a concurring opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), Thomas wrote that \"any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous'\",[*citation needed*] and argued that the Supreme Court should go beyond *Roe vs. Wade* and reconsider other substantive due process precedents, including those established in *Griswold v. Connecticut* (1965), *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003) and *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015). The overturning of these previous decisions would enable states to limit access to contraception, criminalize sodomy, and criminalize same-sex marriage, respectively.[302][303][304]\n\n\n\n#### LGBTQ rights[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**. Please improve this section by adding secondary or tertiary sources. *Find sources:* \"Clarence Thomas\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(October 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nIn *Romer v. Evans* (1996), Thomas joined Scalia's dissenting opinion arguing that Amendment Two to the Colorado State Constitution did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Colorado amendment forbade any judicial, legislative, or executive action designed to protect persons from discrimination based on \"homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships\".[305][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003), Thomas issued a one-page dissent in which he called the Texas statute prohibiting sodomy \"uncommonly silly\", a phrase originally used by Justice Potter Stewart. He then said that if he were a member of the Texas legislature he would vote to repeal the law, as it was not a worthwhile use of \"law enforcement resources\" to police private sexual behavior. But Thomas opined that the Constitution does not contain a right to privacy and therefore did not vote to strike the statute down. He saw the issue as a matter for states to decide for themselves.[306][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia* (2020), Thomas joined Alito and Kavanaugh in dissenting from the decision that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. (Thomas and Alito wrote a dissent together, and Kavanaugh wrote separately.) The 6–3 ruling's majority consisted of two Republican-appointed justices, Roberts and Gorsuch, along with four Democratic-appointed justices: Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.[307]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Thomas joined the other justices in denying an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but wrote a separate opinion reiterating his dissent from *Obergefell v. Hodges* and expressing his belief that it was wrongly decided.[308][309][310] In July 2021, he was one of three justices, with Gorsuch and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[311][312][313] In November 2021, Thomas dissented from the majority of justices in a 6-3 vote to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[314] Alito and Gorsuch also dissented, and the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[315][316]\n\n\n\n### Oral arguments[edit]\n\n\nDuring a 10-year period from February 2006 to February 2016, Thomas read his opinions from the bench but asked no questions during oral arguments.[317][318] He said in 2013 that it was \"unnecessary in deciding cases to ask that many questions ... we should listen to lawyers who are arguing their cases, and I think we should allow the advocates to advocate.\"[319] By May 2020, he had asked questions in two oral arguments since 2006.[320]\n\n\nThomas took a more active role in questioning when the Supreme Court shifted to holding teleconferenced arguments in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic;[321][322][323][320] before that, he had spoken during 32 of the roughly 2,400 arguments since 1991.[324] Since the court resumed in-person oral arguments at the beginning of the 2021 term, the justices agreed to allow Thomas to ask the first question to each advocate.[325]\n\n\nThomas has given many reasons for his silence, including self-consciousness about how he speaks, a preference for listening to those arguing the case, and difficulty getting in a word.[319] His speaking and listening habits may have been influenced by his Gullah upbringing, during which his English was relatively unpolished.[18][62][326] In a 2017 paper in *Northwestern University Law Review*, RonNell Andersen Jones and Aaron L. Nielson wrote that while asking few questions, \"in many ways, [Thomas] is a model questioner.\"[327][328]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas and his wife, Ginni Thomas, on their wedding day in 1987\nIn 1971, Thomas married Kathy Grace Ambush. The couple had one child, Jamal Adeen, born in 1973, who is Thomas's sole child. Thomas and his first wife separated in 1981 and divorced in 1984.[329][330] In 1987, Thomas married Virginia Lamp, a lobbyist and aide to U.S. Representative Dick Armey.[331] In 1997, they took in Thomas's six-year-old great-nephew, Mark Martin Jr.,[332] who had lived with his mother in Savannah public housing.[333] Since 1999, Thomas and his wife have traveled across the U.S. in a motorcoach between Court terms.[334][335]\n\n\nVirginia \"Ginni\" Thomas has remained active in conservative politics, serving as a consultant to The Heritage Foundation and as founder and president of Liberty Central.[336] In 2011, she stepped down from Liberty Central to open a conservative lobbying firm, touting her \"experience and connections\", meeting with newly elected Republican representatives and calling herself an \"ambassador to the Tea Party\".[337][338] Also in 2011, 74 Democratic members of the House of Representatives wrote that Justice Thomas should recuse himself on cases regarding the Affordable Care Act because of \"appearance of a conflict of interest\" based on his wife's work.[339]\n\n\n*The Washington Post* reported in February 2021 that Ginni Thomas apologized to a group of Thomas's former clerks on the email listserv \"Thomas Clerk World\" for her role in contributing to a rift relating to \"pro-Trump postings and former Thomas clerk John Eastman, who spoke at the rally and represented Trump in some of his failed lawsuits filed to overturn the election results\".[340] In March 2022, texts between Ginni Thomas and Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows from 2020 were turned over to the Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.[341] The texts show Ginni Thomas repeatedly urging Meadows to overturn the election results and repeating conspiracy theories about ballot fraud.[342] In response, 24 Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate demanded that Thomas recuse himself from cases related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol on the grounds that Ginni Thomas's involvement in such efforts raised questions about his impartiality.[343] An April 2022 Quinnipiac poll found that 52% of Americans agreed that, in light of Ginni Thomas's texts about overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election, Thomas should have recused himself from related cases.[344]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nThomas was reconciled to the Catholic Church in the mid-1990s.[345] In his autobiography, he criticized the church for failing to grapple with racism in the 1960s during the civil rights movement, saying it was not so \"adamant about ending racism then as it is about ending abortion now\".[346] As of 2021, Thomas is one of 14 practicing Catholic justices in the Court's history and one of six currently serving (along with Alito, Kavanaugh, Roberts, Sotomayor and Barrett).[347]\n\n\n\n### Literary influences[edit]\n\n\nIn 1975, when Thomas read economist Thomas Sowell's *Race and Economics*, he found an intellectual foundation for his philosophy.[348][349] The book criticizes social reform by government and argues for individual action to overcome circumstances and adversity. Ayn Rand's works also influenced him, particularly *The Fountainhead*, and he later required his staffers to watch the 1949 film version of the novel.[350][351] Thomas acknowledges \"some very strong libertarian leanings\", though he does not consider himself a libertarian.[352]\n\n\nThomas has said novelist Richard Wright is the most influential writer in his life; Wright's books *Native Son* and *Black Boy* \"capture[d] a lot of the feelings that I had inside that you learn how to repress\".[329] *Native Son* and Ralph Ellison's *Invisible Man* are Thomas's two favorite novels.[185]\n\n\n\n### Moira Smith allegations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Moira Smith, vice-president and general counsel of a natural gas distributor in Alaska, said that Thomas groped her buttocks at a dinner party in 1999. She was a Truman Foundation scholar helping the director of the foundation set up for a dinner party honoring Thomas and David Adkins. Smith's roommates at the time confirmed that she had told them about the incident. Thomas denied the allegation.[353][354]\n\n\nLouis Blair, who was the head of the Truman Foundation and hosted the dinner at his home, said he had \"no recollection of the incident\" and that he had neither seen nor heard of Smith's allegation. Blair acknowledged that he was in the kitchen most of the time so, if the incident happened, he wouldn't have seen it, but was also \"skeptical that the justice and Moira would have been alone\", given that there were approximately 16 people in three rooms.[355][356] Norma Stevens, who attended the event, said that the incident \"couldn't have happened\" because Thomas was never alone, as he was the guest of honor.[357]\n\n\n\n### Nondisclosure of finances[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Crow's foundation gave $105,000 to Yale Law School, Thomas's alma mater, for the \"Justice Thomas Portrait Fund\", tax filings show.[360]\n\n\nIn 2011, *Politico* reported that Crow gave $500,000 to a Tea Party group founded by Thomas's wife and that Thomas had failed to report her income on his disclosure for more than a decade.[361][362] Also that year, the advocacy group Common Cause reported that between 2003 and 2007, Thomas failed to disclose $686,589 in income his wife earned from The Heritage Foundation, instead reporting \"none\" where \"spousal noninvestment income\" would be reported on his Supreme Court financial disclosure forms.[363] The next week, Thomas said the disclosure of his wife's income had been \"inadvertently omitted due to a misunderstanding of the filing instructions\".[364] He amended reports going back to 1989.[365]\n\n\nIn April 2023, ProPublica reported that Thomas had \"accepted luxury trips virtually every year\" from Crow for two decades and failed to report them. They included flights on Crow's private jet, cruises on Crow's superyacht at locations around the globe, and stays at Crow's private resort in the Adirondacks and the private club Bohemian Grove.[360][366][362] The Ethics in Government Act requires justices, judges, members of Congress and federal officials to annually disclose gifts they receive.[367] Many elected officials criticized the appearance of impropriety, given Crow's donations to conservative causes and Republican candidates, and his service on the Board of Trustees for the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, which have filed amicus briefs before the Supreme Court.[368][360]\n\n\nAlso in April 2023, ProPublica reported that one of Crow's companies bought a house and two empty lots on a residential street in Savannah, Georgia, for $133,000 in 2014. The properties were owned in equal parts by Thomas, his mother, and the family of his deceased brother. Thomas did not report the sale on the disclosure form he filed for 2014. Crow's company also paid for extensive renovations of the house, where Thomas's mother still lives.[369][362]\n\n\nIn May 2023, ProPublica reported that Crow had paid for private school tuition for Thomas's grandnephew, Mark Martin, of whom Thomas had legal custody. Thomas did not report the payments on his financial disclosure forms, while ethics law experts said that they were required to be disclosed as gifts. A bank statement[370] showed that monthly tuition at Hidden Lake Academy, one of the two schools Crow paid for, was $6,200. Mark Paoletta, a longtime friend of Thomas, said that Crow paid for one year each at Hidden Lake and Randolph-Macon Academy, which ProPublica estimated to total around $100,000.[371][362]\n\n\nOn the same day, *The Washington Post* reported that in January 2012 conservative judicial activist Leonard Leo had Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway's polling firm bill the Judicial Education Project $25,000, which her firm then paid to Ginni Thomas's firm, Liberty Consulting, for a total of $80,000 between June 2011 and June 2012. Leo instructed Conway not to mention Thomas's name on the paperwork. The documents the newspaper reviewed did not indicate the nature of the work Thomas did for the Judicial Education Project or Conway's company. In 2012 the Judicial Education Project filed a brief to the Supreme Court in a landmark voting rights case.[372][362]\n\n\nIn 2023, *The New York Times* reported that a friend had paid for Thomas's Prevost Le Mirage XL Marathon RV, purchased for $267,230 in 1999 (roughly equivalent to $489,000 in 2023). Anthony Welters, a former UnitedHealthcare executive and a close friend, lent Thomas the purchase price. In response to a Senate inquiry, Welters revealed that the loan was discharged in 2008, forgiving much of the original balance. A bank would have been unlikely to offer such a loan, given the Marathon's high capacity for customization, which can make used models difficult to appraise. Thomas had previously said that he \"had scrimped and saved to afford the motor coach\", according to the *Times*, and a friend, Armstrong Williams, said that Thomas had told him that \"he saved up all his money to buy it\". When the loan was forgiven, Thomas was required to disclose the money as a gift.[373][374][375][362]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Thomas filed his financial disclosure report for 2022, listing three trips on Crow's jets.[376][377]\n\n\n\n## Honors and recognition[edit]\n\n\nThomas was awarded the 1992 Horatio Alger Award by the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans.[378] In 2001, Thomas was awarded the Francis Boyer Award presented by the American Enterprise Institute.[379] In 2012, Thomas received an honorary degree from the College of the Holy Cross, his alma mater.[380] In 2020, Belmont Abbey College awarded him the Benedict Leadership Award for his devotion to the Catholic faith and government service.[381]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* In the 1996 film *Jerry Maguire*, after Tom Cruise's character makes a pass at his employee (played by Renee Zellweger), he apologizes with, \"I feel like Clarence Thomas.\"[382]\n* Wendell Pierce portrayed Thomas in the 2016 film *Confirmation*.\n* In May 2023, Michael Kirk directed a *Frontline* documentary about Thomas's life and career, narrated by Will Lyman.[383][384] John Danforth, who was interviewed for the documentary, wrote in an op-ed published in *The Wall Street Journal* that the excerpts of his interview included in the film were only \"biographical filler\" and criticized the film as a whole as \"a two-hour hit job on the character of Clarence Thomas\".[385]\n\n\n## Writings[edit]\n\n\n* \"Why Black Americans Should Look to Conservative Policies\". *The Heritage Lectures*.

In that same period, Thomas was the third-most-frequent dissenter on the Court, behind Stevens and Scalia.[179] Scalia's and Thomas's agreement rate peaked in 1996 at 98%.[179] By 2004, other pairs of justices were more closely aligned than Scalia and Thomas.[180]\n4. **^** Thomas's close early association with Scalia came under scrutiny by critics in multiple law review articles. In November 1996, *Emerge* magazine titled him as \"Uncle Thomas: Lawn Jockey of the Far Right\".[181] Linda Greenhouse observed that Thomas voted with Scalia 91% of the time during October Term 2006, and with Justice John Paul Stevens the least, 36% of the time.[182] Biographer Jan Crawford noted that Scalia often joined Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia.[183][184] Biographer Corey Robin has called the idea that Thomas followed Scalia's votes a debunked myth.[185]\n5. **^** Thomas's jurisprudence has also been compared to that of Justice Hugo Black, who \"resisted the tendency to create social policy out of 'whole cloth.'\" According to the same critic, Thomas generally declines to engage in judicial lawmaking, viewing the Court's constitutional role as the interpretation of law, rather than making law.[192][193]\n6. **^** In 2005, while an assistant professor of law at Notre Dame Law School, future-Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that Thomas supports statutory *stare decisis*. Her examples included his concurring opinion in *Fogerty v. Fantasy* (1994).[196]\n7. **^** \"Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt\" (PDF). U.S. Supreme Court. 2018.

And in the transcript of your October 7 interview, you responded to a question saying that it was sexual harassment.  \n\n\"A: In my opinion, based on my reading of the law, yes, it was. But later on, immediately following that response, I noted to the press that I did not raise a claim of sexual harassment in this complaint. It seems to me that the behavior has to be evaluated on its own with regard to the fitness of this individual to act as an Associate Justice. It seems to me that even if it does not rise to the level of sexual harassment, it is behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court.\"\n149. **^** Pollitt, Katha. *Subject to Debate: Sense and Dissents on Women, Politics, and Culture*, page 161 (2001): \"The question Hill's testimony placed before us was not whether Thomas was guilty of a legally actionable offense (she herself was unsure if his behavior added up to sexual harassment) but whether he belonged on the Supreme Court.\"\n150. **^** Segers, Grace (September 19, 2018). \"Here are some of the questions Anita Hill answered in 1991\".

Alone with Thomas, \"I was setting the place to his right when he reached out, sort of cupped his hand around my butt and pulled me pretty close to him,\" Smith said in an interview. \"He said, 'Where are you sitting?' and gave me a squeeze.

I said yes, and that was the end of it.\" Smith said the other guests then assembled for the dinner and she went to the garden table to take her seat.\n354. **^** McCaskill, Nolan D.
