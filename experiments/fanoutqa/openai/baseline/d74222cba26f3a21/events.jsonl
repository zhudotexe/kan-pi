A country scores a higher level of HDI when the lifespan is higher, the education level is higher, and the gross national income GNI (PPP) per capita is higher. It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq and was further used to measure a country's development by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s Human Development Report Office.[1][2][3]\n\n\nThe 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). While the simple HDI remains useful, it stated that \"the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality), while the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential' human development (or the maximum level of HDI) that could be achieved if there were no inequality.\"[4]\n\n\nThe index is based on the human development approach, developed by Mahbub ul-Haq, anchored in Amartya Sen's work on human capabilities, and often framed in terms of whether people are able to \"be\" and \"do\" desirable things in life. Examples include – being: well fed, sheltered, and healthy; doing: work, education, voting, participating in community life. The freedom of choice is central – someone choosing to be hungry (e.g. when fasting for religious reasons) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they cannot afford to buy food, or because the country is in a famine.[5]\n\n\nThe index does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking of some of the most developed countries, such as the G7 members and others.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Origins[edit]\n\n\nThe origins of the HDI are found in the annual Human Development Reports produced by the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq in 1990, and had the explicit purpose \"to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies\". Haq believed that a simple composite measure of human development was needed to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being.\n\n\n\n![](image)The underlying principles behind the Human Development Index.[5]\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and calculation[edit]\n\n\n### New method (2010 HDI onwards)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)HDI trends between 1990 and 2021 \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| World\n OECD countries\n |  Developing countries: Arab States\n East Asia and the Pacific\n Europe and Central Asia\n Latin America and the Caribbean\n South Asia\n Sub-Saharan Africa\n |\n\n\nPublished on 4 November 2010 (and updated on 10 June 2011), the 2010 Human Development Report calculated the HDI combining three dimensions:[7][8]\n\n\n\n* A long and healthy life: Life expectancy at birth\n* Education: Mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling\n* A decent standard of living: GNI per capita (PPP international dollars)\n\n\nIn its 2010 Human Development Report, the UNDP began using a new method of calculating the HDI. The following three indices are used:\n\n\n1. Life Expectancy Index (LEI) \n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nLE\n\n\n−\n20\n\n\n85\n−\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {{\\textrm {LE}}-20}{85-20}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {{\\textrm {LE}}-20}{85-20}}}](image)\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nLE\n\n\n−\n20\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {{\\textrm {LE}}-20}{65}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {{\\textrm {LE}}-20}{65}}}](image)\n\n\n\nLEI is equal to 1 when life expectancy at birth is 85 years, and 0 when life expectancy at birth is 20 years.\n2.

incl. young men and women aged 13–17)  \n\nGNIpc: Gross national income at purchasing power parity per capita\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Old method (HDI before 2010)[edit]\n\n\nThe HDI combined three dimensions last used in its 2009 report:\n\n\n\n* Life expectancy at birth, as an index of population health and longevity to HDI\n* Knowledge and education, as measured by the adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weighting) and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio (with one-third weighting).\n* Standard of living, as indicated by the natural logarithm of gross domestic product per capita at purchasing power parity.\n\n\n![](image)HDI trends between 1975 and 2004 \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| OECD\n Europe (not in the OECD), and CIS\n Latin America and the Caribbean\n East Asia\n | Arab League\n South Asia\n Sub-Saharan Africa\n |\n\n\nThis methodology was used by the UNDP until their 2011 report.\n\n\nThe formula defining the HDI is promulgated by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).[12] In general, to transform a raw variable, say \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n![{\\displaystyle x}](image), into a unit-free index between 0 and 1 (which allows different indices to be added together), the following formula is used:\n\n\n\n* x\n\n index\n\n=\n\n\n\nx\n−\na\n\n\nb\n−\na\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x{\\text{ index}}={\\frac

b}\n\n![{\\displaystyle b}](image) are the lowest and highest values the variable \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n![{\\displaystyle x}](image) can attain, respectively.\n\n\nThe Human Development

They identified three sources of data error which are due to (i) data updating, (ii) formula revisions and (iii) thresholds to classify a country's development status and conclude that 11%, 21% and 34% of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error, respectively. The authors suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because: the cut-off values seem arbitrary, can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, and have the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large.[17]\n\n\nIn 2010, the UNDP reacted to the criticism and updated the thresholds to classify nations as low, medium, and high human development countries. In a comment to *The Economist* in early January 2011, the Human Development Report Office responded[18] to a 6 January 2011 article in the magazine[19] which discusses the Wolff *et al.* paper. The Human Development Report Office states that they undertook a systematic revision of the methods used for the calculation of the HDI, and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by Wolff *et al.* in that it generates a system for continuously updating the human-development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place.\n\n\nIn 2013, Salvatore Monni and Alessandro Spaventa emphasized that in the debate of GDP versus HDI, it is often forgotten that these are both external indicators that prioritize different benchmarks upon which the quantification of societal welfare can be predicated. The larger question is whether it is possible to shift the focus of policy from a battle between competing paradigms to a mechanism for eliciting information on well-being directly from the population.[20]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n### Indices[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Modern history portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n\n\n* Gross National Happiness\n* Broad measures of economic progress\n* Corruption Perceptions Index\n* Democracy indices\n* Fragile States Index\n* Gender Inequality Index\n* Gender Development Index\n* Genuine progress indicator (GPI)\n* Global Peace Index (GPI)\n* Green gross domestic product (Green GDP)\n* Green national product\n* Gross domestic product\n* Gross National Well-being (GNW)\n* Happy Planet Index (HPI)\n* Human Poverty Index\n* List of countries by inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI)\n* Legatum Prosperity Index\n* List of countries by Human Development Index\n* Living Planet Index\n* Multidimensional Poverty Index\n* OECD Better Life Index (BLI)\n* List of countries by planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI)\n* World Press Freedom Index\n* Rule of Law Index\n* Social Progress Index\n* Where-to-be-born Index\n* World Happiness Report\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\n* Developing country\n* Economic development\n* Ethics of care\n* Happiness economics\n* Human Development and Capability Association\n* Humanistic economics\n* International development\n* List of sovereign states by percentage of population living in poverty\n* List of countries by share of income of the richest one percent\n* Right to an adequate standard of living\n* Life satisfaction\n* Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** HDI not available before 2018 in latest report\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A.

A country scores a higher level of HDI when the lifespan is higher, the education level is higher, and the gross national income GNI (PPP) per capita is higher. It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq and was further used to measure a country's development by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s Human Development Report Office.[1][2][3]\n\n\nThe 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). While the simple HDI remains useful, it stated that \"the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality), while the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential' human development (or the maximum level of HDI) that could be achieved if there were no inequality.\"[4]\n\n\nThe index is based on the human development approach, developed by Mahbub ul-Haq, anchored in Amartya Sen's work on human capabilities, and often framed in terms of whether people are able to \"be\" and \"do\" desirable things in life. Examples include – being: well fed, sheltered, and healthy; doing: work, education, voting, participating in community life. The freedom of choice is central – someone choosing to be hungry (e.g. when fasting for religious reasons) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they cannot afford to buy food, or because the country is in a famine.[5]\n\n\nThe index does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking of some of the most developed countries, such as the G7 members and others.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Origins[edit]\n\n\nThe origins of the HDI are found in the annual Human Development Reports produced by the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq in 1990, and had the explicit purpose \"to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies\". Haq believed that a simple composite measure of human development was needed to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being.\n\n\n\n![](image)The underlying principles behind the Human Development Index.[5]\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and calculation[edit]\n\n\n### New method (2010 HDI onwards)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)HDI trends between 1990 and 2021 \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| World\n OECD countries\n |  Developing countries: Arab States\n East Asia and the Pacific\n Europe and Central Asia\n Latin America and the Caribbean\n South Asia\n Sub-Saharan Africa\n |\n\n\nPublished on 4 November 2010 (and updated on 10 June 2011), the 2010 Human Development Report calculated the HDI combining three dimensions:[7][8]\n\n\n\n* A long and healthy life: Life expectancy at birth\n* Education: Mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling\n* A decent standard of living: GNI per capita (PPP international dollars)\n\n\nIn its 2010 Human Development Report, the UNDP began using a new method of calculating the HDI. The following three indices are used:\n\n\n1. Life Expectancy Index (LEI) \n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nLE\n\n\n−\n20\n\n\n85\n−\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {{\\textrm {LE}}-20}{85-20}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {{\\textrm {LE}}-20}{85-20}}}](image)\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nLE\n\n\n−\n20\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {{\\textrm {LE}}-20}{65}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {{\\textrm {LE}}-20}{65}}}](image)\n\n\n\nLEI is equal to 1 when life expectancy at birth is 85 years, and 0 when life expectancy at birth is 20 years.\n2.

incl. young men and women aged 13–17)  \n\nGNIpc: Gross national income at purchasing power parity per capita\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Old method (HDI before 2010)[edit]\n\n\nThe HDI combined three dimensions last used in its 2009 report:\n\n\n\n* Life expectancy at birth, as an index of population health and longevity to HDI\n* Knowledge and education, as measured by the adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weighting) and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio (with one-third weighting).\n* Standard of living, as indicated by the natural logarithm of gross domestic product per capita at purchasing power parity.\n\n\n![](image)HDI trends between 1975 and 2004 \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| OECD\n Europe (not in the OECD), and CIS\n Latin America and the Caribbean\n East Asia\n | Arab League\n South Asia\n Sub-Saharan Africa\n |\n\n\nThis methodology was used by the UNDP until their 2011 report.\n\n\nThe formula defining the HDI is promulgated by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).[12] In general, to transform a raw variable, say \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n![{\\displaystyle x}](image), into a unit-free index between 0 and 1 (which allows different indices to be added together), the following formula is used:\n\n\n\n* x\n\n index\n\n=\n\n\n\nx\n−\na\n\n\nb\n−\na\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x{\\text{ index}}={\\frac

b}\n\n![{\\displaystyle b}](image) are the lowest and highest values the variable \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n![{\\displaystyle x}](image) can attain, respectively.\n\n\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) then represents the uniformly weighted sum with 1⁄3 contributed by each of the following factor indices:\n\n\n\n* Life Expectancy Index

They identified three sources of data error which are due to (i) data updating, (ii) formula revisions and (iii) thresholds to classify a country's development status and conclude that 11%, 21% and 34% of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error, respectively. The authors suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because: the cut-off values seem arbitrary, can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, and have the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large.[17]\n\n\nIn 2010, the UNDP reacted to the criticism and updated the thresholds to classify nations as low, medium, and high human development countries. In a comment to *The Economist* in early January 2011, the Human Development Report Office responded[18] to a 6 January 2011 article in the magazine[19] which discusses the Wolff *et al.* paper. The Human Development Report Office states that they undertook a systematic revision of the methods used for the calculation of the HDI, and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by Wolff *et al.* in that it generates a system for continuously updating the human-development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place.\n\n\nIn 2013, Salvatore Monni and Alessandro Spaventa emphasized that in the debate of GDP versus HDI, it is often forgotten that these are both external indicators that prioritize different benchmarks upon which the quantification of societal welfare can be predicated. The larger question is whether it is possible to shift the focus of policy from a battle between competing paradigms to a mechanism for eliciting information on well-being directly from the population.[20]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n### Indices[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Modern history portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n\n\n* Gross National Happiness\n* Broad measures of economic progress\n* Corruption Perceptions Index\n* Democracy indices\n* Fragile States Index\n* Gender Inequality Index\n* Gender Development Index\n* Genuine progress indicator (GPI)\n* Global Peace Index (GPI)\n* Green gross domestic product (Green GDP)\n* Green national product\n* Gross domestic product\n* Gross National Well-being (GNW)\n* Happy Planet Index (HPI)\n* Human Poverty Index\n* List of countries by inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI)\n* Legatum Prosperity Index\n* List of countries by Human Development Index\n* Living Planet Index\n* Multidimensional Poverty Index\n* OECD Better Life Index (BLI)\n* List of countries by planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI)\n* World Press Freedom Index\n* Rule of Law Index\n* Social Progress Index\n* Where-to-be-born Index\n* World Happiness Report\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\n* Developing country\n* Economic development\n* Ethics of care\n* Happiness economics\n* Human Development and Capability Association\n* Humanistic economics\n* International development\n* List of sovereign states by percentage of population living in poverty\n* List of countries by share of income of the richest one percent\n* Right to an adequate standard of living\n* Life satisfaction\n* Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** HDI not available before 2018 in latest report\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A.

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(July 2023)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)NATO member states as of 2023.\nNATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is an international military alliance consisting of 31 member states from Europe and North America. It was established at the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April 1949. Article 5 of the treaty states that if an armed attack occurs against one of the member states, it shall be considered an attack against all members, and other members shall assist the attacked member, with armed forces if necessary.[1] Article 6 of the treaty limits the scope of Article 5 to the islands north of the Tropic of Cancer, the North American and European mainlands, the entirety of Turkey, and French Algeria, the last of which is moot. Thus, an attack on Hawaii, Puerto Rico, French Guiana, the Falkland Islands, Ceuta or Melilla, among other places, would not trigger an Article 5 response.\n\n\nOf the 31 member countries, 29 are in Europe and two are in North America. Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, including the Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative, and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.\n\n\nAll members have militaries, except for Iceland, which does not have a typical army (but it does have a coast guard and a small unit of civilian specialists for NATO operations). Three of NATO's members are nuclear weapons states: France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. NATO has 12 original founding member states. Three more members joined between 1952 and 1955, and a fourth joined in 1982. After the end of the Cold War, NATO added 15 more members from 1999 to 2023.[2]\n\n\n\nNATO currently recognizes Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Sweden, and Ukraine as aspiring members as part of their Open Doors enlargement policy.[3]\n\n![](image)Map of NATO in Europe:Current members\nCountries in the process of accession\nCountries seeking membership\nCountries where membership is not a goal\nCSTO\n\n\n## Founding members and enlargement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Enlargement of NATO\n\nNATO was established on 4 April 1949 via the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty (Washington Treaty). The 12 founding members of the Alliance were: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[4]\n\n\nThe various allies all sign the Ottawa Agreement,[5] which is a 1951 document that acts to embody civilian oversight of the Alliance.[5][6]\n\n\nCurrent membership consists of 31 countries. In addition to the 12 founding countries, four new members joined during the Cold War: Greece and Turkey (1952), West Germany (1955) and Spain (1982). In 1990, the territory of the former East Germany was added with the reunification of Germany. NATO further expanded after the Cold War, adding the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland (1999), Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia (2004), Albania and Croatia (2009), Montenegro (2017), North Macedonia (2020), and Finland (2023).[4] Of the territories and members added between 1990 and 2023, all were either formerly part of the Warsaw Pact (including the formerly Soviet Baltic states) or territories of the former Yugoslavia except for Finland. No countries have left NATO since its founding.\n\n\nCurrently, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization now covers a total area of 27,131,087 km2 (10,475,371 sq mi), since the accession of Finland on 4 April 2023.\n\n\n\n### Membership aspirations[edit]\n\n\nAs of April 2023[update], four additional states have formally informed NATO of their membership aspirations: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Sweden and Ukraine.[3]\n\n\n\n* NATO members agreed at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Georgia and Ukraine \"will become members of NATO in the future\".[7]\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina was invited by NATO to join the Membership Action Plan (MAP) in April 2010.[7]\n* In May 2022, Finland and Sweden simultaneously submitted official application letters to become NATO members.[8][9]\n\t+ Finland became a member on April 4, 2023.\n\t+ As of July 10, 2023, all members except Hungary and Turkey had ratified Sweden's accession protocol, with both committing to complete their approval by October.[10]\n\n\n## List of member states[edit]\n\n\nThe current members and their dates of admission are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Flag | Map | Name | Capital\n | Date ofAccession[11] |

arrangements[edit]\n\n\nThe three Nordic countries which joined NATO as founding members, Denmark, Iceland and Norway, chose to limit their participation in three areas: there would be no permanent peacetime bases, no nuclear warheads and no Allied military activity (unless invited) permitted on their territory. However, Denmark allowed the U.S. to maintain an existing base, Thule Air Base (now Pituffik Space Base), in Greenland.[17]\n\n\nFrom the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, France pursued a military strategy of independence from NATO under a policy dubbed \"Gaullo-Mitterrandism\".[18] Nicolas Sarkozy negotiated the return of France to the integrated military command and the Defence Planning Committee in 2009, the latter being disbanded the following year. France remains the only NATO member outside the Nuclear Planning Group and unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, will not commit its nuclear-armed submarines to the alliance.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## Military personnel[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Comparison of military personnel per 1,000 capita.\n |\n| 50\n\n\n100\n\n\n150\n\n\n200\n\n\n250\n\n\n300\n\nCountries (see legend)\n\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* Greece\n* Portugal\n* Montenegro\n* Lithuania\n* Norway\n* Turkey\n* Latvia\n* Denmark\n* Croatia\n* North Macedonia\n* Romania\n* Hungary\n* United States\n* Bulgaria\n* Italy\n* France\n* Poland\n* Spain\n* Slovenia\n* United Kingdom\n* Slovakia\n* Canada\n* Germany\n* Netherlands\n* Albania\n* Belgium\n* Czech Republic\n* Luxembourg\n* Iceland\n |\n\n\nThe following list is constructed from *The Military Balance*, published annually by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbers of military personnel\n| Country[21] | Active\n | Reserve | Para­mili­tary | Total\n | Per 1,000 capita\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| total | active\n |\n| ![Albania](image) | Albania | 10,500\n | 0\n | 500\n | 11,000\n | 3.6\n | 3.4\n |\n| ![Belgium](image) | Belgium | 29,400\n | 5,900\n | 0\n | 35,300\n | 3\n | 2.5\n |\n| ![Bulgaria](image) | Bulgaria | 42,663\n | 3,000\n | 0\n | 45,663\n | 6.6\n | 6.2\n |\n| ![Canada](image) | Canada | 70,500\n | 35,600\n | 5,500\n | 111,600\n | 2.9\n | 1.9\n |\n| ![Croatia](image) | Croatia | 16,700\n | 21,000\n | 3,000\n | 40,700\n | 9.7\n | 4\n |\n| ![Czech Republic](image) | Czech Republic | 27,400\n | 4,200\n | 0\n | 31,600\n | 3\n | 2.6\n |\n| ![Denmark](image) | Denmark | 20,440\n | 45,800\n | 0\n | 66,240\n | 11.2\n | 3.5\n |\n| ![Estonia](image) | Estonia | 7,600\n | 230,000\n | 15,800\n | 253,400\n | 207.7\n | 6.2\n |\n| ![Finland](image) | Finland | 24,250\n | 900,000\n | 14,321\n | 938,571\n | 168.7\n | 4.4\n |\n| ![France](image) | France | 208,750\n | 141,050\n | 175,050\n | 524,850\n | 7.7\n | 3.1\n |\n| ![Germany](image) | Germany | 184,100\n | 50,050\n | 0\n | 234,150\n | 2.9\n | 2.3\n |\n| ![Greece](image) | Greece | 143,300\n | 221,350\n | 4,000\n | 368,650\n | 34.8\n | 13.5\n |\n| ![Hungary](image) | Hungary | 41,600\n | 20,000\n | 12,000\n | 73,600\n | 7.6\n | 4.3\n |\n| ![Iceland](image) | Iceland | 250\n | 250\n | 250\n | 750\n | 2.1\n | 0.7\n |\n| ![Italy](image) | Italy[p] | 175,100\n | 18,300\n | 182,350\n | 375,750\n | 6\n | 2.8\n |\n| ![Latvia](image) | Latvia | 16,700\n | 36,000\n | 0\n | 52,700\n | 28.3\n | 9\n |\n| ![Lithuania](image) | Lithuania | 23,000\n | 90,000\n | 14,150\n | 127,150\n | 46.9\n | 8.5\n |\n| ![Luxembourg](image) | Luxembourg | 940\n | 0\n | 600\n | 1,540\n | 2.4\n | 1.5\n |\n| ![Montenegro](image) | Montenegro | 2,350\n | 2,800\n | 10,100\n | 15,250\n | 25.1\n | 3.9\n |\n| ![Netherlands](image) | Netherlands | 41,543\n | 6,643\n | 6,500\n | 54,686\n | 3.2\n | 2.4\n |\n| ![North Macedonia](image) | North Macedonia | 8,000\n | 26,850\n | 7,600\n | 42,450\n | 19.9\n | 3.8\n |\n| ![Norway](image) | Norway | 25,400\n | 40,000\n | 0\n | 65,400\n | 11.9\n | 4.6\n |\n| ![Poland](image) | Poland | 164,500\n | 200,000\n | 75,400\n | 439,900\n | 11.5\n | 4.3\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) | Portugal | 33,200\n | 211,700\n | 24,700\n | 269,600\n | 26.3\n | 3.2\n |\n| ![Romania](image) | Romania | 72,000\n | 55,000\n | 79,900\n | 206,900\n | 9.7\n | 3.4\n |\n| ![Slovakia](image) | Slovakia | 19,500\n | 0\n | 0\n | 19,500\n | 3.6\n | 3.6\n |\n| ![Slovenia](image) | Slovenia | 7,500\n | 26,200\n | 5,950\n | 39,650\n | 18.9\n | 3.6\n |\n| ![Spain](image) | Spain | 133,282\n | 15,450\n | 75,800\n | 224,532\n | 4.8\n | 2.8\n |\n| ![Turkey](image) | Turkey | 640,811\n | 378,700\n | 156,800\n | 1,176,311\n | 14.3\n | 7.8\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image) | United Kingdom | 196,453\n | 78,600\n | 0\n | 275,053\n | 4.2\n | 3\n |\n| ![United States](image) | United States | 1,456,870\n | 870,760\n | 0\n | 2,327,630\n | 6.9\n | 4.3\n |\n| ![NATO](image) | NATO | 3,845,002\n | 3,735,203\n | 870,271\n | 8,450,476\n | 8.9\n | 4\n |\n\n\n## Military expenditures[edit]\n\n\nMilitary spending of the US compared to 29 other NATO member countries (all except Finland) (US$ millions).[q]\n\n\n\nUnited States (70.46%)\nAll other NATO countries total[r] (29.53%)\n\nTotal military spending of NATO member countries except the United States and Finland (US$ millions).[q][s]\n\n\n\nGreece (1.58%)\nEstonia (0.21%)\nPortugal (1.09%)\nMontenegro (0.03%)\nLithuania (0.35%)\nNorway (2.34%)\nTurkey (4.54%)\nLatvia (0.23%)\nDenmark (1.55%)\nCroatia (0.35%)\nNorth Macedonia (0.035%)\nRomania (1.64%)\nHungary (0.67%)\nBulgaria (0.35%)\nItaly (7.99%)\nFrance (16.55%)\nPoland (3.91%)\nSpain (4.29%)\nSlovenia (0.18%)\nUnited Kingdom (19.72%)\nSlovakia (0.62%)\nCanada (7.15%)\nGermany (17.68%)\nNetherlands (4.05%)\nOther (2.895%)\n\n*United States and Finland omitted -

The response to whether their country should militarily aid another NATO country if it were to get into a serious military conflict with Russia was also mixed. Roughly half or fewer in six of the eight countries surveyed say their country should use military force if Russia attacks a neighboring country that is a NATO ally. And at least half in three of the eight NATO countries say that their government should not use military force in such circumstances. The strongest opposition to responding with armed force is in Germany (58%), followed by France (53%) and Italy (51%). More than half of Americans (56%) and Canadians (53%) are willing to respond to Russian military aggression against a fellow NATO country. A plurality of the British (49%) and Poles (48%) would also live up to their Article 5 commitment. The Spanish are divided on the issue: 48% support it, 47% oppose.[29][30]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Population data is based on a July 2021 estimate by the Central Intelligence Agency in *The World Factbook*.[12]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** Founding member of NATO.\n3. **^** Officially referred to by the name **Czechia**. *(See Czech Republic#Name.)*\n4. **^** Denmark consists of Denmark proper, the Faroe Islands and Greenland.\n5. **^** including Faroe Islands and Greenland.\n6. **^** Excluding all overseas territories of France apart from Saint Pierre and Miquelon.\n7. **^** Germany initially joined NATO as West Germany.

It was established at the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April 1949. Article 5 of the treaty states that if an armed attack occurs against one of the member states, it shall be considered an attack against all members, and other members shall assist the attacked member, with armed forces if necessary.[1] Article 6 of the treaty limits the scope of Article 5 to the islands north of the Tropic of Cancer, the North American and European mainlands, the entirety of Turkey, and French Algeria, the last of which is moot. Thus, an attack on Hawaii, Puerto Rico, French Guiana, the Falkland Islands, Ceuta or Melilla, among other places, would not trigger an Article 5 response.\n\n\nOf the 31 member countries, 29 are in Europe and two are in North America. Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, including the Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative, and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.\n\n\nAll members have militaries, except for Iceland, which does not have a typical army (but it does have a coast guard and a small unit of civilian specialists for NATO operations). Three of NATO's members are nuclear weapons states: France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. NATO has 12 original founding member states. Three more members joined between 1952 and 1955, and a fourth joined in 1982. After the end of the Cold War, NATO added 15 more members from 1999 to 2023.[2]\n\n\n\nNATO currently recognizes Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Sweden, and Ukraine as aspiring members as part of their Open Doors enlargement policy.[3]\n\n![](image)Map of NATO in Europe:Current members\nCountries in the process of accession\nCountries seeking membership\nCountries where membership is not a goal\nCSTO\n\n\n## Founding members and enlargement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Enlargement of NATO\n\nNATO was established on 4 April 1949 via the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty (Washington Treaty). The 12 founding members of the Alliance were: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[4]\n\n\nThe various allies all sign the Ottawa Agreement,[5] which is a 1951 document that acts to embody civilian oversight of the Alliance.[5][6]\n\n\nCurrent membership consists of 31 countries. In addition to the 12 founding countries, four new members joined during the Cold War: Greece and Turkey (1952), West Germany (1955) and Spain (1982). In 1990, the territory of the former East Germany was added with the reunification of Germany. NATO further expanded after the Cold War, adding the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland (1999), Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia (2004), Albania and Croatia (2009), Montenegro (2017), North Macedonia (2020), and Finland (2023).[4] Of the territories and members added between 1990 and 2023, all were either formerly part of the Warsaw Pact (including the formerly Soviet Baltic states) or territories of the former Yugoslavia except for Finland. No countries have left NATO since its founding.\n\n\nCurrently, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization now covers a total area of 27,131,087 km2 (10,475,371 sq mi), since the accession of Finland on 4 April 2023.\n\n\n\n### Membership aspirations[edit]\n\n\nAs of April 2023[update], four additional states have formally informed NATO of their membership aspirations: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Sweden and Ukraine.[3]\n\n\n\n* NATO members agreed at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Georgia and Ukraine \"will become members of NATO in the future\".[7]\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina was invited by NATO to join the Membership Action Plan (MAP) in April 2010.[7]\n* In May 2022, Finland and Sweden simultaneously submitted official application letters to become NATO members.[8][9]\n\t+ Finland became a member on April 4, 2023.\n\t+ As of July 10, 2023, all members except Hungary and Turkey had ratified Sweden's accession protocol, with both committing to complete their approval by October.[10]\n\n\n## List of member states[edit]\n\n\nThe current members and their dates of admission are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Flag | Map | Name | Capital\n | Date ofAccession[11] |

arrangements[edit]\n\n\nThe three Nordic countries which joined NATO as founding members, Denmark, Iceland and Norway, chose to limit their participation in three areas: there would be no permanent peacetime bases, no nuclear warheads and no Allied military activity (unless invited) permitted on their territory. However, Denmark allowed the U.S. to maintain an existing base, Thule Air Base (now Pituffik Space Base), in Greenland.[17]\n\n\nFrom the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, France pursued a military strategy of independence from NATO under a policy dubbed \"Gaullo-Mitterrandism\".[18] Nicolas Sarkozy negotiated the return of France to the integrated military command and the Defence Planning Committee in 2009, the latter being disbanded the following year. France remains the only NATO member outside the Nuclear Planning Group and unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, will not commit its nuclear-armed submarines to the alliance.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## Military personnel[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Comparison of military personnel per 1,000 capita.\n |\n| 50\n\n\n100\n\n\n150\n\n\n200\n\n\n250\n\n\n300\n\nCountries (see legend)\n\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* Greece\n* Portugal\n* Montenegro\n* Lithuania\n* Norway\n* Turkey\n* Latvia\n* Denmark\n* Croatia\n* North Macedonia\n* Romania\n* Hungary\n* United States\n* Bulgaria\n* Italy\n* France\n* Poland\n* Spain\n* Slovenia\n* United Kingdom\n* Slovakia\n* Canada\n* Germany\n* Netherlands\n* Albania\n* Belgium\n* Czech Republic\n* Luxembourg\n* Iceland\n |\n\n\nThe following list is constructed from *The Military Balance*, published annually by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbers of military personnel\n| Country[21] | Active\n | Reserve | Para­mili­tary | Total\n | Per 1,000 capita\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| total | active\n |\n| ![Albania](image) | Albania | 10,500\n | 0\n | 500\n | 11,000\n | 3.6\n | 3.4\n |\n| ![Belgium](image) | Belgium | 29,400\n | 5,900\n | 0\n | 35,300\n | 3\n | 2.5\n |\n| ![Bulgaria](image) | Bulgaria | 42,663\n | 3,000\n | 0\n | 45,663\n | 6.6\n | 6.2\n |\n| ![Canada](image) | Canada | 70,500\n | 35,600\n | 5,500\n | 111,600\n | 2.9\n | 1.9\n |\n| ![Croatia](image) | Croatia | 16,700\n | 21,000\n | 3,000\n | 40,700\n | 9.7\n | 4\n |\n| ![Czech Republic](image) | Czech Republic | 27,400\n | 4,200\n | 0\n | 31,600\n | 3\n | 2.6\n |\n| ![Denmark](image) | Denmark | 20,440\n | 45,800\n | 0\n | 66,240\n | 11.2\n | 3.5\n |\n| ![Estonia](image) | Estonia | 7,600\n | 230,000\n | 15,800\n | 253,400\n | 207.7\n | 6.2\n |\n| ![Finland](image) | Finland | 24,250\n | 900,000\n | 14,321\n | 938,571\n | 168.7\n | 4.4\n |\n| ![France](image) | France | 208,750\n | 141,050\n | 175,050\n | 524,850\n | 7.7\n | 3.1\n |\n| ![Germany](image) | Germany | 184,100\n | 50,050\n | 0\n | 234,150\n | 2.9\n | 2.3\n |\n| ![Greece](image) | Greece | 143,300\n | 221,350\n | 4,000\n | 368,650\n | 34.8\n | 13.5\n |\n| ![Hungary](image) | Hungary | 41,600\n | 20,000\n | 12,000\n | 73,600\n | 7.6\n | 4.3\n |\n| ![Iceland](image) | Iceland | 250\n | 250\n | 250\n | 750\n | 2.1\n | 0.7\n |\n| ![Italy](image) | Italy[p] | 175,100\n | 18,300\n | 182,350\n | 375,750\n | 6\n | 2.8\n |\n| ![Latvia](image) | Latvia | 16,700\n | 36,000\n | 0\n | 52,700\n | 28.3\n | 9\n |\n| ![Lithuania](image) | Lithuania | 23,000\n | 90,000\n | 14,150\n | 127,150\n | 46.9\n | 8.5\n |\n| ![Luxembourg](image) | Luxembourg | 940\n | 0\n | 600\n | 1,540\n | 2.4\n | 1.5\n |\n| ![Montenegro](image) | Montenegro | 2,350\n | 2,800\n | 10,100\n | 15,250\n | 25.1\n | 3.9\n |\n| ![Netherlands](image) | Netherlands | 41,543\n | 6,643\n | 6,500\n | 54,686\n | 3.2\n | 2.4\n |\n| ![North Macedonia](image) | North Macedonia | 8,000\n | 26,850\n | 7,600\n | 42,450\n | 19.9\n | 3.8\n |\n| ![Norway](image) | Norway | 25,400\n | 40,000\n | 0\n | 65,400\n | 11.9\n | 4.6\n |\n| ![Poland](image) | Poland | 164,500\n | 200,000\n | 75,400\n | 439,900\n | 11.5\n | 4.3\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) | Portugal | 33,200\n | 211,700\n | 24,700\n | 269,600\n | 26.3\n | 3.2\n |\n| ![Romania](image) | Romania | 72,000\n | 55,000\n | 79,900\n | 206,900\n | 9.7\n | 3.4\n |\n| ![Slovakia](image) | Slovakia | 19,500\n | 0\n | 0\n | 19,500\n | 3.6\n | 3.6\n |\n| ![Slovenia](image) | Slovenia | 7,500\n | 26,200\n | 5,950\n | 39,650\n | 18.9\n | 3.6\n |\n| ![Spain](image) | Spain | 133,282\n | 15,450\n | 75,800\n | 224,532\n | 4.8\n | 2.8\n |\n| ![Turkey](image) | Turkey | 640,811\n | 378,700\n | 156,800\n | 1,176,311\n | 14.3\n | 7.8\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image) | United Kingdom | 196,453\n | 78,600\n | 0\n | 275,053\n | 4.2\n | 3\n |\n| ![United States](image) | United States | 1,456,870\n | 870,760\n | 0\n | 2,327,630\n | 6.9\n | 4.3\n |\n| ![NATO](image) | NATO | 3,845,002\n | 3,735,203\n | 870,271\n | 8,450,476\n | 8.9\n | 4\n |\n\n\n## Military expenditures[edit]\n\n\nMilitary spending of the US compared to 29 other NATO member countries (all except Finland) (US$ millions).[q]\n\n\n\nUnited States (70.46%)\nAll other NATO countries total[r] (29.53%)\n\nTotal military spending of NATO member countries except the United States and Finland (US$ millions).[q][s]\n\n\n\nGreece (1.58%)\nEstonia (0.21%)\nPortugal (1.09%)\nMontenegro (0.03%)\nLithuania (0.35%)\nNorway (2.34%)\nTurkey (4.54%)\nLatvia (0.23%)\nDenmark (1.55%)\nCroatia (0.35%)\nNorth Macedonia (0.035%)\nRomania (1.64%)\nHungary (0.67%)\nBulgaria (0.35%)\nItaly (7.99%)\nFrance (16.55%)\nPoland (3.91%)\nSpain (4.29%)\nSlovenia (0.18%)\nUnited Kingdom (19.72%)\nSlovakia (0.62%)\nCanada (7.15%)\nGermany (17.68%)\nNetherlands (4.05%)\nOther (2.895%)\n\n*United States and Finland omitted -

The response to whether their country should militarily aid another NATO country if it were to get into a serious military conflict with Russia was also mixed. Roughly half or fewer in six of the eight countries surveyed say their country should use military force if Russia attacks a neighboring country that is a NATO ally. And at least half in three of the eight NATO countries say that their government should not use military force in such circumstances. The strongest opposition to responding with armed force is in Germany (58%), followed by France (53%) and Italy (51%). More than half of Americans (56%) and Canadians (53%) are willing to respond to Russian military aggression against a fellow NATO country. A plurality of the British (49%) and Poles (48%) would also live up to their Article 5 commitment. The Spanish are divided on the issue: 48% support it, 47% oppose.[29][30]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Population data is based on a July 2021 estimate by the Central Intelligence Agency in *The World Factbook*.[12]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** Founding member of NATO.\n3. **^** Officially referred to by the name **Czechia**. *(See Czech Republic#Name.)*\n4. **^** Denmark consists of Denmark proper, the Faroe Islands and Greenland.\n5. **^** including Faroe Islands and Greenland.\n6. **^** Excluding all overseas territories of France apart from Saint Pierre and Miquelon.\n7. **^** Germany initially joined NATO as West Germany.
