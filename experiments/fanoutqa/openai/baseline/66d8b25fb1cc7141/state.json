During this period, the tournament was divided into the East and West Regions. From 1952 to 1955, the Regional Championships were held at four sites, with two designated for the East and two for the West. In 1956, the four regions were given unique names for the first time. \n\n\nFrom 1946 to 1981, a consolation game was conducted before the Championship for the losing teams of the National Semifinals; the winning team was awarded third place and the losing team was awarded fourth place. In 1982, the NCAA eliminated the game and the two losing teams of the semifinal games are considered tied for third place in the official record book.\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the championship game, one player is awarded the Most Outstanding Player award. Eleven times a player was awarded the MOP without being on the championship team. Five players have won the award twice, one player, Lew Alcindor, won the award three times.\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Year** | **Team** | **Conference** | **Region** | Seed | Coach | **Result** | MOP |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **1939** | **Oregon** | **Pacific Coast**[a] | **West** |  | **Howard Hobson** | **Champion** |  |\n| Ohio State | Big Ten\n | East\n |  | Harold Olsen\n | Runner-up\n | Jimmy Hull\n |\n| Oklahoma | Big Six[b] | West\n |  | Bruce Drake\n |  |  |\n| Villanova | Independent\n | East\n |  | Alexander Severance\n |  |  |\n| **1940** | **Indiana** | **Big Ten** | **East** |  | **Branch McCracken** | **Champion** | **Marvin Huffman** |\n| Kansas | Big Six[b] | West\n |  | Phog Allen\n | Runner-up\n |  |\n| Duquesne | Independent\n | East\n |  | Chick Davies\n |  |  |\n| USC | Pacific Coast[a] | West\n |  | Sam Barry\n |  |  |\n| **1941** | **Wisconsin** | **Big Ten** | **East** |  | **Harold E.

Of these, 14 have coached two schools and only one, Rick Pitino, has coached three schools. Two additional coaches appeared with multiple schools but had all appearances with one of those schools vacated. Larry Brown appeared with UCLA and Kansas but his only appearance with UCLA school were vacated. John Calipari appeared with UMass, Memphis, and Kentucky, but his only appearances at UMass and Memphis were vacated. Five coaches are still active, with Calipari, Huggins, Larra\u00f1aga, and Sampson coaching at a school they have already taken to the Final Four. Pitino is the only coach on this list currently active at a school he has not taken to the Final Four.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Head Coach\n | Schools\n | Final Fours\n | Third Place\n | Runner Up\n | Champion\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Three Schools\n |\n| **Rick Pitino** | Providence\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Kentucky\n | 3\n |  | 1\n | 1\n |\n| Louisville\n | 1 (2 vac.)\n |  | 0\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n |\n| **John Calipari** | UMass\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Memphis\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n |  | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 0\n |\n| Kentucky\n | 4\n |  | 1\n | 1\n |\n| Two Schools\n |\n| Forddy Anderson | Bradley\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Michigan State\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Gene Bartow | Memphis*[j]* | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| UCLA\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Larry Brown | UCLA\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 0\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 0\n |\n| Kansas\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Hugh Durham | Florida State\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Georgia\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Jack Gardner | Kansas State\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Utah\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Lou Henson | New Mexico State\n | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Illinois\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| **Bob Huggins** | Cincinnati\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| West Virginia\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Lon Kruger | Florida\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Oklahoma\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| **Jim Larra\u00f1aga** | George Mason\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Miami\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Frank McGuire | St. John's\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| North Carolina\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Lute Olson | Iowa\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Arizona\n | 4\n |  | 1\n | 1\n |\n| Lee Rose | Charlotte[m] | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Purdue\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| **Kelvin Sampson** | Oklahoma\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Houston\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Eddie Sutton | Arkansas\n | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Oklahoma State\n | 2\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Roy Williams | Kansas\n | 4\n |  | 2\n | 0\n |\n| North Carolina\n | 5\n |  | 1\n | 3\n |\n\n\n### Coaches who also played in the Final Four[edit]\n\n\nSeven coaches have both played and coached in the Final Four.

Conferences are listed by their current or final name as found in the official NCAA record book.\n\n\nThere have been 26 unique conferences appearing in the Final Four, of which 19 are still in existence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Conference\n | Schools\n | Final Fours\n | Third Place\n | Runner Up\n | Champion\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First\n | Last\n | Appearances\n |\n| American Athletic (2013\u2013 )\n | 2\n | 2014\n | 2021\n | 2\n |  | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Atlantic 10 (1976\u2013 )\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 1996\n | 1996\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Atlantic Coast (1953\u2013 )\n | 9\n | 1957\n | 2023\n | 49\n | 5\n | 12\n | 15\n |\n| Big 12 (1995\u2013 )\n | 5\n | 2002\n | 2022\n | 12\n |  | 3\n | 3\n |\n| Big East (1979\u2013 )\nincluding original Big East[q]\n | 10\n | 1982\n | 2023\n | 22 (2 vac.)\n |  | 5\n | 9 (1 vac.)\n |\n| Big Eight[b] (1928\u20131996)\n | 6\n | 1939\n | 1995\n | 20\n | 1\n | 7\n | 2\n |\n| Big Ten[f] (1905\u2013 )\n | 8 (1 vac.)\n | 1939\n | 2019\n | 48 (4 vac.)\n | 8\n | 14 (2 vac.)\n | 10\n |\n| Big West (1969\u2013 )\n | 1\n | 1987\n | 1991\n | 3\n |  | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Colonial Athletic Association(1982\u2013 )\n | 2\n | 2006\n | 2011\n | 2\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Conference USA (1995\u2013 )\n | 4\n | 2003\n | 2023\n | 3 (1 vac.)\n |  | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 0\n |\n| East Coast (1958\u20131995)\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 1961\n | 1961\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Great Midwest (1991\u20131995)\n | 1\n | 1992\n | 1992\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Horizon League (1982\u2013 )\n | 1\n | 2010\n | 2011\n | 2\n |  | 2\n | 0\n |\n| Independent\n | 31\n | 1939\n | 1979\n | 39 (1 vac.)\n | 8\n | 10 (1 vac.)\n | 6\n |\n| Ivy League[c] (1901\u2013 )\n | 3\n | 1942\n | 1979\n | 4\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n |\n| Metro (1975\u20131995)\n | 2\n | 1980\n | 1986\n | 4 (1 vac.)\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n |\n| Missouri Valley (1928\u2013 )\n | 9\n | 1945\n | 2018\n | 18\n | 4\n | 5\n | 4\n |\n| Mountain West (1999\u2013 )\n | 1\n | 2023\n | 2023\n | 1\n |  | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Ohio Valley (1948\u2013 )\n | 1\n | 1971\n | 1971\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Pac-12[a] (1915\u2013 )\n | 9\n | 1939\n | 2021\n | 34 (1 vac.)\n | 3\n | 4 (1 vac.)\n | 15\n |\n| Skyline Eight[d] (1938\u20131962)\n | 3\n | 1942\n | 1961\n | 4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n |\n| Southeastern (1932\u2013 )\n | 9\n | 1942\n | 2019\n | 32\n | 0\n | 6\n | 11\n |\n| Southern (1921\u2013 )\n | 3\n | 1946\n | 1959\n | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n |\n| Southwest (1914\u20131996)\n | 4\n | 1941\n | 1990\n | 12\n | 2\n | 3\n | 0\n |\n| Sun Belt (1976\u2013 )\n | 0 (1 vac.)\n | 1977\n | 1977\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| West Coast[g] (1952\u2013 )\n | 2\n | 1955\n | 2021\n | 5\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n |\n| Western Athletic (1962\u2013 )\n | 1\n | 1966\n | 1998\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n\n\n### Final Fours with multiple schools from the same conference[edit]\n\n\nThere have been 25 Final Fours with multiple teams from the same conference. In two of these Final Fours, one of the conference team's appearance was later vacated later by the NCAA. The Big Ten has achieved this nine times, with one appearance later vacated, tying them with the Atlantic Coast Conference for non-vacated multi-team Final Four appearances. The Big East is the only conference to have three teams in the Final Four, which was in 1985. \n\n\nTeams from the same conference have played against each other in nine National Semifinal games. Only three times have teams from the same conference played each other in the National Championship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Final Fours\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atlantic Coast\n | 1981\u2020\u00a7, 1990\u00a7, 1991\u2021, 2001\u2020\u00a7, 2004, 2016\u2021\u00a7, 2022\u00a7 |\n| Big 12\n | 2003\u2021 |\n| Big East\n | 1985\u2020\u2021\u00a7 (3 teams), 1987\u00a7, 2009, 2013\u2020 (vac.)\n |\n| Big Eight\n | 1988\u2020\u2021 |\n| Big Ten\n | 1976\u2020\u2021, 1980, 1989\u00a7, 1992, 1999 (vac.), 2000\u00a7, 2005, 2015\n |\n| Southeastern\n | 1994\u2020, 1996\u2020, 2006\u2020, 2014\n |\n\n\n\u2020National Champion; \u2021Runner Up; \u00a7Teams played in National Semifinals\n\n\n\u2020\u2021Teams played in National Championship game\n\n\n\n## Final Four appearances by state[edit]\n\n\nSchools from 38 states, including the District of Columbia, have appeared in the Final Four. An additional state, Minnesota, had its only appearance vacated. This table shows non-vacated Final Four appearances and victories by state; vacated records are shown in parentheses. The Third Place column is blank for states whose Final Four appearances were before 1946 or after 1981.

Teams from the same state have played each other four times in a National Semifinal and teams from the same state have played each other twice in the National Championship, both times Cincinnati and Ohio State in 1960 and 1961.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Final Four\n | State\n | Teams\n | Game Played\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1954 | Pennsylvania\n | La Salle\u2020 | Penn State\u00a7 | National Semifinal\n |\n| 1960 | Ohio\n | Cincinnati\u00a7 | Ohio State\u2020 |  |\n| 1961 | Ohio\n | Cincinnati\u2020 | Ohio State\u2021 | National Championship\n |\n| 1962 | Ohio\n | Cincinnati\u2020 | Ohio State\u2021 | National Championship\n |\n| 1975 | Kentucky\n | Kentucky\u2020 | Louisville\u00a7 |  |\n| 1977 | North Carolina\n | Charlotte | North Carolina\u2021 |  |\n| 1991 | North Carolina\n | Duke\u2020 | North Carolina |  |\n| 2012 | Kentucky\n | Kentucky\u2020 | Louisville (vac.)\n | National Semifinal\n |\n| 2021 | Texas\n | Baylor\u2020 | Houston | National Semifinal\n |\n| 2022 | North Carolina\n | Duke | North Carolina\u2021 | National Semifinal\n |\n| 2023 | Florida\n | Florida Atlantic | Miami |  |\n\n\n\u2020 National Champion; \u2021 Runner-Up; \u00a7 Third Place\n\n\n\n## Vacated appearances[edit]\n\n\nThirteen Final Four appearances have been vacated by ten schools. Two of these schools won the Third Place Game and five schools were the National Runners Up. Only one school, the University of Louisville, has had its National Championship vacated.\n\n\n\n* Saint Joseph's vacated its 1961 semifinal loss and third-place game victory because three players were involved in a point-shaving scandal.[1][2]\n* Villanova vacated its 1971 championship game loss because Howard Porter had signed a professional contract with the Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association (ABA) during the regular season. The Most Outstanding Player award was also vacated, as it had been awarded to Porter despite his team losing the championship game.[3]\n* Western Kentucky vacated its 1971 semifinal loss and third-place game victory because Jim McDaniels had signed a professional contract with the Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association and accepted money during the regular season.[4]\n* UCLA vacated its 1980 championship game loss because Kiki Vandeweghe and Rod Foster were declared ineligible for their connection with recruiting violations involving booster Sam Gilbert.[5]\n* Memphis State (now Memphis) vacated its 1985 semifinal loss because Keith Lee had received $40,000 in illegal payoffs from head coach Dana Kirk.[6][4]\n* Michigan vacated its 1992 and 1993 championship game losses because Chris Webber, Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor, and Louis Bullock were found ineligible.[7]\n* UMass vacated its 1996 semifinal loss because Marcus Camby had accepted money and gifts from a pair of sports agents.[8]\n* Minnesota vacated its 1997 semifinal loss because involving head coach Clem Haskins, five other university employees, and at least eighteen players had committed academic fraud.[9]\n* Ohio State vacated its 1999 semifinal loss because Boban Savovi\u0107 was declared ineligible.[10]\n* Memphis vacated its 2008 championship game loss because Derrick Rose's SAT score was invalidated after the season.[11]\n* Louisville vacated its 2012 semifinal loss and their 2013 national championship because several unnamed players were declared ineligible as a result of a sex scandal.[12] The Most Outstanding Player award, awarded to Luke Hancock, was vacated as part of the disciplinary action. Hancock and four other players sued the NCAA and alleged they had been cast in a \"false light\" in relation to the scandal. The NCAA agreed to restore their awards and statistics as part of a settlement, including Hancock's MOP award.[13]\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** ***ac*** ***ad*** ***ae*** ***af*** ***ag*** ***ah*** ***ai*** ***aj*** The Pac-12 Conference was previously named the Pacific Coast Conference, Athletic Association of Western Universities, Pacific-8 Conference, and Pacific-10 Conference.
