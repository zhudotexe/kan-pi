Each codon consists of three nucleotides, usually corresponding to a single amino acid. The nucleotides are abbreviated with the letters A, U, G and C. This is mRNA, which uses U (uracil). DNA uses T (thymine) instead. This mRNA molecule will instruct a ribosome to synthesize a protein according to this code.\nThe **genetic code** is the set of rules used by living cells to translate information encoded within genetic material (DNA or RNA sequences of nucleotide triplets, or codons) into proteins. Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links proteinogenic amino acids in an order specified by messenger RNA (mRNA), using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.\n\n\nThe codons specify which amino acid will be added next during protein biosynthesis. With some exceptions,[1] a three-nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a single scheme (see the RNA codon table). That scheme is often referred to as the canonical or standard genetic code, or simply *the* genetic code, though variant codes (such as in mitochondria) exist.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The genetic codeFurther information: Adaptor hypothesis\n\nEfforts to understand how proteins are encoded began after DNA's structure was discovered in 1953. The key discoverers, English biophysicist Francis Crick and American biologist James Watson, working together at the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge, hypothesied that information flows from DNA and that there is a link between DNA and proteins.[2] Soviet-American physicist George Gamow was the first to give a workable scheme for protein synthesis from DNA.[3] He postulated that sets of three bases (triplets) must be employed to encode the 20 standard amino acids used by living cells to build proteins, which would allow a maximum of 43 = 64 amino acids.[4] He named this DNA–protein interaction (the original genetic code) as the \"diamond code\".[5]\n\n\nIn 1954, Gamow created an informal scientific organisation the RNA Tie Club, as suggested by Watson, for scientists of different persuasions who were interested in how proteins were synthesised from genes. However, the club could have only 20 permanent members to represent each of the 20 amino acids; and four additional honorary members to represent the four nucleotides of DNA.[6]\n\n\nThe first scientific contribution of the club, later recorded as \"one of the most important unpublished articles in the history of science\"[7] and \"the most famous unpublished paper in the annals of molecular biology\",[8] was made by Crick. Crick presented a type-written paper titled \"On Degenerate Templates and the Adaptor Hypothesis: A Note for the RNA Tie Club\"[9] to the members of the club in January 1955, which \"totally changed the way we thought about protein synthesis\", as Watson recalled.[10] The hypothesis states that the triplet code was not passed on to amino acids as Gamow thought, but carried by a different molecule, an adaptor, that interacts with amino acids.[8] The adaptor was later identified as tRNA.[11]\n\n\n\n### Codons[edit]\n\n\n\"Codon\" redirects here. For other uses, see Codon (disambiguation).\n\nSee also: DNA and RNA codon tables § Translation table 1\n\nThe Crick, Brenner, Barnett and Watts-Tobin experiment first demonstrated that **codons** consist of three DNA bases. \n\n\nMarshall Nirenberg and Heinrich J. Matthaei were the first to reveal the nature of a codon in 1961.[12] They used a cell-free system to translate a poly-uracil RNA sequence (i.e., UUUUU...) and discovered that the polypeptide that they had synthesized consisted of only the amino acid phenylalanine.[13] They thereby deduced that the codon UUU specified the amino acid phenylalanine.\n\n\nThis was followed by experiments in Severo Ochoa's laboratory that demonstrated that the poly-adenine RNA sequence (AAAAA...) coded for the polypeptide poly-lysine[14] and that the poly-cytosine RNA sequence (CCCCC...) coded for the polypeptide poly-proline.[15] Therefore, the codon AAA specified the amino acid lysine, and the codon CCC specified the amino acid proline. Using various copolymers most of the remaining codons were then determined.\n\n\nSubsequent work by Har Gobind Khorana identified the rest of the genetic code. Shortly thereafter, Robert W. Holley determined the structure of transfer RNA (tRNA), the adapter molecule that facilitates the process of translating RNA into protein. This work was based upon Ochoa's earlier studies, yielding the latter the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for work on the enzymology of RNA synthesis.[16]\n\n\nExtending this work, Nirenberg and Philip Leder revealed the code's triplet nature and deciphered its codons. In these experiments, various combinations of mRNA were passed through a filter that contained ribosomes, the components of cells that translate RNA into protein. Unique triplets promoted the binding of specific tRNAs to the ribosome. Leder and Nirenberg were able to determine the sequences of 54 out of 64 codons in their experiments.[17] Khorana, Holley and Nirenberg received the 1968 Nobel for their work.[18]\n\n\nThe three stop codons were named by discoverers Richard Epstein and Charles Steinberg. \"Amber\" was named after their friend Harris Bernstein, whose last name means \"amber\" in German.[19] The other two stop codons were named \"ochre\" and \"opal\" in order to keep the \"color names\" theme.\n\n\n\n### Expanded genetic codes (synthetic biology)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Expanded genetic code\n\nSee also: Nucleic acid analogues\n\nIn a broad academic audience, the concept of the evolution of the genetic code from the original and ambiguous genetic code to a well-defined (\"frozen\") code with the repertoire of 20 (+2) canonical amino acids is widely accepted.[20]\nHowever, there are different opinions, concepts, approaches and ideas, which is the best way to change it experimentally. Even models are proposed that predict \"entry points\" for synthetic amino acid invasion of the genetic code.[21]\n\n\nSince 2001, 40 non-natural amino acids have been added into proteins by creating a unique codon (recoding) and a corresponding transfer-RNA:aminoacyl – tRNA-synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins.[22][23]\n\n\nH. Murakami and M. Sisido extended some codons to have four and five bases. Steven A. Benner constructed a functional 65th (*in vivo*) codon.[24]\n\n\nIn 2015 N. Budisa, D. Söll and co-workers reported the full substitution of all 20,899 tryptophan residues (UGG codons) with unnatural thienopyrrole-alanine in the genetic code of the bacterium *Escherichia coli*.[25]\n\n\nIn 2016 the first stable semisynthetic organism was created. It was a (single cell) bacterium with two synthetic bases (called X and Y). The bases survived cell division.[26][27]\n\n\nIn 2017, researchers in South Korea reported that they had engineered a mouse with an extended genetic code that can produce proteins with unnatural amino acids.[28]\n\n\nIn May 2019, researchers reported the creation of a new \"Syn61\" strain of the bacterium *Escherichia coli*. This strain has a fully synthetic genome that is refactored (all overlaps expanded), recoded (removing the use of three out of 64 codons completely), and further modified to remove the now unnecessary tRNAs and release factors. It is fully viable and grows 1.6× slower than its wild-type counterpart \"MDS42\".[29][30]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Reading frames in the DNA sequence of a region of the human mitochondrial genome coding for the genes *MT-ATP8* and *MT-ATP6* (in black: positions 8,525 to 8,580 in the sequence accession NC\\_012920[31]). There are three possible reading frames in the 5' → 3' forward direction, starting on the first (+1), second (+2) and third position (+3). For each codon (square brackets), the amino acid is given by the vertebrate mitochondrial code, either in the +1 frame for *MT-ATP8* (in red) or in the +3 frame for *MT-ATP6* (in blue). The *MT-ATP8* genes terminates with the TAG stop codon (red dot) in the +1 frame. The *MT-ATP6* gene starts with the ATG codon (blue circle for the M amino acid) in the +3 frame.\n### Reading frame[edit]\n\n\nA reading frame is defined by the initial triplet of nucleotides from which translation starts. It sets the frame for a run of successive, non-overlapping codons, which is known as an \"open reading frame\" (ORF). For example, the string 5'-AAATGAACG-3' (see figure), if read from the first position, contains the codons AAA, TGA, and ACG ; if read from the second position, it contains the codons AAT and GAA ; and if read from the third position, it contains the codons ATG and AAC. Every sequence can, thus, be read in its 5' → 3' direction in three reading frames, each producing a possibly distinct amino acid sequence: in the given example, Lys (K)-Trp (W)-Thr (T), Asn (N)-Glu (E), or Met (M)-Asn (N), respectively (when translating with the vertebrate mitochondrial code). When DNA is double-stranded, six possible reading frames are defined, three in the forward orientation on one strand and three reverse on the opposite strand.[32]: 330 Protein-coding frames are defined by a start codon, usually the first AUG (ATG) codon in the RNA (DNA) sequence.\n\n\nIn eukaryotes, ORFs in exons are often interrupted by introns.\n\n\n\n### Start and stop codons[edit]\n\n\nTranslation starts with a chain-initiation codon or start codon. The start codon alone is not sufficient to begin the process. Nearby sequences such as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in *E. coli* and initiation factors are also required to start translation. The most common start codon is AUG, which is read as methionine or as formylmethionine (in bacteria, mitochondria, and plastids). Alternative start codons depending on the organism include \"GUG\" or \"UUG\"; these codons normally represent valine and leucine, respectively, but as start codons they are translated as methionine or formylmethionine.[33]\n\n\nThe three stop codons have names: UAG is *amber*, UGA is *opal* (sometimes also called *umber*), and UAA is *ochre*. Stop codons are also called \"termination\" or \"nonsense\" codons. They signal release of the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome because no cognate tRNA has anticodons complementary to these stop signals, allowing a release factor to bind to the ribosome instead.[34]\n\n\n\n### Effect of mutations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Examples of notable mutations that can occur in humans[35]\nDuring the process of DNA replication, errors occasionally occur in the polymerization of the second strand. These errors, mutations, can affect an organism's phenotype, especially if they occur within the protein coding sequence of a gene. Error rates are typically 1 error in every 10–100 million bases—due to the \"proofreading\" ability of DNA polymerases.[36][37]\n\n\nMissense mutations and nonsense mutations are examples of point mutations that can cause genetic diseases such as sickle-cell disease and thalassemia respectively.[38][39][40] Clinically important missense mutations generally change the properties of the coded amino acid residue among basic, acidic, polar or non-polar states, whereas nonsense mutations result in a stop codon.[32]\n\n\nMutations that disrupt the reading frame sequence by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases are known as frameshift mutations. These mutations usually result in a completely different translation from the original, and likely cause a stop codon to be read, which truncates the protein.[41] These mutations may impair the protein's function and are thus rare in *in vivo* protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of frameshift mutations is rare is that, if the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism faces, absence of a functional protein may cause death before the organism becomes viable.[42] Frameshift mutations may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay–Sachs disease.[43]\n\n\nAlthough most mutations that change protein sequences are harmful or neutral, some mutations have benefits.[44] These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation will tend to become more common in a population through natural selection.[45] Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates,[46] which can be an advantage, since these viruses thereby evolve rapidly, and thus evade the immune system defensive responses.[47] In large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, *E. coli*, multiple beneficial mutations may co-occur. This phenomenon is called clonal interference and causes competition among the mutations.[48]\n\n\n\n### Degeneracy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Codon degeneracy\n\n![](image)Grouping of codons by amino acid residue molar volume and hydropathicity. A more detailed version is available.\n![](image)Axes 1, 2, 3 are the first, second, and third positions in the codon. The 20 amino acids and stop codons (X) are shown in single letter code.\nDegeneracy is the redundancy of the genetic code. This term was given by Bernfield and Nirenberg. The genetic code has redundancy but no ambiguity (see the codon tables below for the full correlation). For example, although codons GAA and GAG both specify glutamic acid (redundancy), neither specifies another amino acid (no ambiguity). The codons encoding one amino acid may differ in any of their three positions. For example, the amino acid leucine is specified by **Y**U**R** or CU**N** (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, or CUG) codons (difference in the first or third position indicated using IUPAC notation), while the amino acid serine is specified by UC**N** or AG**Y** (UCA, UCG, UCC, UCU, AGU, or AGC) codons (difference in the first, second, or third position).[49] A practical consequence of redundancy is that errors in the third position of the triplet codon cause only a silent mutation or an error that would not affect the protein because the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity is maintained by equivalent substitution of amino acids; for example, a codon of NUN (where N = any nucleotide) tends to code for hydrophobic amino acids. NCN yields amino acid residues that are small in size and moderate in hydropathicity; NAN encodes average size hydrophilic residues. The genetic code is so well-structured for hydropathicity that a mathematical analysis (Singular Value Decomposition) of 12 variables (4 nucleotides x 3 positions) yields a remarkable correlation (C = 0.95) for predicting the hydropathicity of the encoded amino acid directly from the triplet nucleotide sequence, *without translation.*[50][51] Note in the table, below, eight amino acids are not affected at all by mutations at the third position of the codon, whereas in the figure above, a mutation at the second position is likely to cause a radical change in the physicochemical properties of the encoded amino acid.\nNevertheless, changes in the first position of the codons are more important than changes in the second position on a global scale.[52] The reason may be that charge reversal (from a positive to a negative charge or vice versa) can only occur upon mutations in the first position of certain codons, but not upon changes in the second position of any codon. Such charge reversal may have dramatic consequences for the structure or function of a protein. This aspect may have been largely underestimated by previous studies.[52]\n\n\n\n### Codon usage bias[edit]\n\n\nThe frequency of codons, also known as codon usage bias, can vary from species to species with functional implications for the control of translation.

For example, UGA can code for selenocysteine and UAG can code for pyrrolysine. Selenocysteine came to be seen as the 21st amino acid, and pyrrolysine as the 22nd.[55] Unlike selenocysteine, pyrrolysine-encoded UAG is translated with the participation of a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.[56] Both selenocysteine and pyrrolysine may be present in the same organism.[55] Although the genetic code is normally fixed in an organism, the achaeal prokaryote *Acetohalobium arabaticum* can expand its genetic code from 20 to 21 amino acids (by including pyrrolysine) under different conditions of growth.[57]\n\n\n\n### Variations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of genetic codes\n\n![](image)Genetic code logo of the *Globobulimina pseudospinescens* mitochondrial genome by FACIL.[58] The logo shows the 64 codons from left to right, predicted alternatives in red (relative to the standard genetic code). Red line: stop codons. The height of each amino acid in the stack shows how often it is aligned to the codon in homologous protein domains. The stack height indicates the support for the prediction.\nThere was originally a simple and widely accepted argument that the genetic code should be universal: namely, that any variation in the genetic code would be lethal to the organism (although Crick had stated that viruses were an exception). This is known as the \"frozen accident\" argument for the universality of the genetic code. However, in his seminal paper on the origins of the genetic code in 1968, Francis Crick still stated that the universality of the genetic code in all organisms was an unproven assumption, and was probably not true in some instances. He predicted that \"The code is universal (the same in all organisms) or nearly so\".[59] The first variation was discovered in 1979, by researchers studying human mitochondrial genes.[60] Many slight variants were discovered thereafter,[61] including various alternative mitochondrial codes.[62] These minor variants for example involve translation of the codon UGA as tryptophan in *Mycoplasma* species, and translation of CUG as a serine rather than leucine in yeasts of the \"CTG clade\" (such as *Candida albicans*).[63][64][65] Because viruses must use the same genetic code as their hosts, modifications to the standard genetic code could interfere with viral protein synthesis or functioning. However, viruses such as totiviruses have adapted to the host's genetic code modification.[66] In bacteria and archaea, GUG and UUG are common start codons. In rare cases, certain proteins may use alternative start codons.[61]\nSurprisingly, variations in the interpretation of the genetic code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop codon is naturally used to encode the amino acids tryptophan and arginine.[67] This type of recoding is induced by a high-readthrough stop codon context[68] and it is referred to as *functional translational readthrough*.[69]\n\n\nDespite these differences, all known naturally occurring codes are very similar. The coding mechanism is the same for all organisms: three-base codons, tRNA, ribosomes, single direction reading and translating single codons into single amino acids.[70] The most extreme variations occur in certain ciliates where the meaning of stop codons depends on their position within mRNA. When close to the 3' end they act as terminators while in internal positions they either code for amino acids as in *Condylostoma magnum*[71] or trigger ribosomal frameshifting as in *Euplotes*.[72]\n\n\nThe origins and variation of the genetic code, including the mechanisms behind the evolvability of the genetic code, have been widely studied,[73][74] and some studies have been done experimentally evolving the genetic code of some organisms.[75][76][77][78]\n\n\n\n### Inference[edit]\n\n\nVariant genetic codes used by an organism can be inferred by identifying highly conserved genes encoded in that genome, and comparing its codon usage to the amino acids in homologous proteins of other organisms. For example, the program FACIL infers a genetic code by searching which amino acids in homologous protein domains are most often aligned to every codon. The resulting amino acid (or stop codon) probabilities for each codon are displayed in a genetic code logo.[58]\n\n\nAs of January 2022, the most complete survey of genetic codes is done by Shulgina and Eddy, who screened 250,000 prokaryotic genomes using their Codetta tool. This tool uses a similar approach to FACIL with a larger Pfam database. Despite the NCBI already providing 33 translation tables, the authors were able to find new 5 genetic code variations (corroborated by tRNA mutations) and correct several misattributions.[79]\n\n\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\n\nThe genetic code is a key part of the history of life, according to one version of which self-replicating RNA molecules preceded life as we know it. This is the RNA world hypothesis. Under this hypothesis, any model for the emergence of the genetic code is intimately related to a model of the transfer from ribozymes (RNA enzymes) to proteins as the principal enzymes in cells. In line with the RNA world hypothesis, transfer RNA molecules appear to have evolved before modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, so the latter cannot be part of the explanation of its patterns.[80]\n\n\nA hypothetical randomly evolved genetic code further motivates a biochemical or evolutionary model for its origin. If amino acids were randomly assigned to triplet codons, there would be 1.5 × 1084 possible genetic codes.[81]: 163 This number is found by calculating the number of ways that 21 items (20 amino acids plus one stop) can be placed in 64 bins, wherein each item is used at least once.[82] However, the distribution of codon assignments in the genetic code is nonrandom.[83] In particular, the genetic code clusters certain amino acid assignments.\n\n\nAmino acids that share the same biosynthetic pathway tend to have the same first base in their codons. This could be an evolutionary relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids.[84] It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons,[85][86] reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.[83]\n\n\nGiven the non-random genetic triplet coding scheme, a tenable hypothesis for the origin of genetic code could address multiple aspects of the codon table, such as absence of codons for D-amino acids, secondary codon patterns for some amino acids, confinement of synonymous positions to third position, the small set of only 20 amino acids (instead of a number approaching 64), and the relation of stop codon patterns to amino acid coding patterns.[87]\n\n\nThree main hypotheses address the origin of the genetic code. Many models belong to one of them or to a hybrid:[88]\n\n\n\n* Random freeze: the genetic code was randomly created. For example, early tRNA-like ribozymes may have had different affinities for amino acids, with codons emerging from another part of the ribozyme that exhibited random variability. Once enough peptides were coded for, any major random change in the genetic code would have been lethal; hence it became \"frozen\".[89]\n* Stereochemical affinity: the genetic code is a result of a high affinity between each amino acid and its codon or anti-codon; the latter option implies that pre-tRNA molecules matched their corresponding amino acids by this affinity. Later during evolution, this matching was gradually replaced with matching by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.[87][90][91]\n* Optimality: the genetic code continued to evolve after its initial creation, so that the current code maximizes some fitness function, usually some kind of error minimization.[87][88][92]\n\n\nHypotheses have addressed a variety of scenarios:[93]\n\n\n\n* Chemical principles govern specific RNA interaction with amino acids. Experiments with aptamers showed that some amino acids have a selective chemical affinity for their codons.[94] Experiments showed that of 8 amino acids tested, 6 show some RNA triplet-amino acid association.[81][91]\n* Biosynthetic expansion. The genetic code grew from a simpler earlier code through a process of \"biosynthetic expansion\". Primordial life \"discovered\" new amino acids (for example, as by-products of metabolism) and later incorporated some of these into the machinery of genetic coding.[95] Although much circumstantial evidence has been found to suggest that fewer amino acid types were used in the past,[96] precise and detailed hypotheses about which amino acids entered the code in what order are controversial.[97][98] However, several studies have suggested that Gly, Ala, Asp, Val, Ser, Pro, Glu, Leu, Thr may belong to a group of early-addition amino acids, whereas Cys, Met, Tyr, Trp, His, Phe may belong to a group of later-addition amino acids.[99][100][101][102]\n* Natural selection has led to codon assignments of the genetic code that minimize the effects of mutations.[103] A recent hypothesis[104] suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used longer than triplet codons (such as quadruplet codons). Longer than triplet decoding would increase codon redundancy and would be more error resistant. This feature could allow accurate decoding absent complex translational machinery such as the ribosome, such as before cells began making ribosomes.\n* Information channels: Information-theoretic approaches model the process of translating the genetic code into corresponding amino acids as an error-prone information channel.[105] The inherent noise (that is, the error) in the channel poses the organism with a fundamental question: how can a genetic code be constructed to withstand noise[106] while accurately and efficiently translating information? These \"rate-distortion\" models[107] suggest that the genetic code originated as a result of the interplay of the three conflicting evolutionary forces: the needs for diverse amino acids,[108] for error-tolerance[103] and for minimal resource cost. The code emerges at a transition when the mapping of codons to amino acids becomes nonrandom. The code's emergence is governed by the topology defined by the probable errors and is related to the map coloring problem.[109]\n* Game theory: Models based on signaling games combine elements of game theory, natural selection and information channels. Such models have been used to suggest that the first polypeptides were likely short and had non-enzymatic function. Game theoretic models suggested that the organization of RNA strings into cells may have been necessary to prevent \"deceptive\" use of the genetic code, i.e. preventing the ancient equivalent of viruses from overwhelming the RNA world.[110]\n* Stop codons: Codons for translational stops are also an interesting aspect to the problem of the origin of the genetic code. As an example for addressing stop codon evolution, it has been suggested that the stop codons are such that they are most likely to terminate translation early in the case of a frame shift error.[111] In contrast, some stereochemical molecular models explain the origin of stop codons as \"unassignable\".[87]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of genetic engineering software\n* Codon tables\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Turanov AA, Lobanov AV, Fomenko DE, Morrison HG, Sogin ML, Klobutcher LA, Hatfield DL, Gladyshev VN (January 2009). \"Genetic code supports targeted insertion of two amino acids by one codon\". *Science*. **323** (5911): 259–61. doi:10.1126/science.1164748.

Each codon consists of three nucleotides, usually corresponding to a single amino acid. The nucleotides are abbreviated with the letters A, U, G and C. This is mRNA, which uses U (uracil). DNA uses T (thymine) instead. This mRNA molecule will instruct a ribosome to synthesize a protein according to this code.\nThe **genetic code** is the set of rules used by living cells to translate information encoded within genetic material (DNA or RNA sequences of nucleotide triplets, or codons) into proteins. Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links proteinogenic amino acids in an order specified by messenger RNA (mRNA), using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.\n\n\nThe codons specify which amino acid will be added next during protein biosynthesis. With some exceptions,[1] a three-nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a single scheme (see the RNA codon table). That scheme is often referred to as the canonical or standard genetic code, or simply *the* genetic code, though variant codes (such as in mitochondria) exist.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The genetic codeFurther information: Adaptor hypothesis\n\nEfforts to understand how proteins are encoded began after DNA's structure was discovered in 1953. The key discoverers, English biophysicist Francis Crick and American biologist James Watson, working together at the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge, hypothesied that information flows from DNA and that there is a link between DNA and proteins.[2] Soviet-American physicist George Gamow was the first to give a workable scheme for protein synthesis from DNA.[3] He postulated that sets of three bases (triplets) must be employed to encode the 20 standard amino acids used by living cells to build proteins, which would allow a maximum of 43 = 64 amino acids.[4] He named this DNA–protein interaction (the original genetic code) as the \"diamond code\".[5]\n\n\nIn 1954, Gamow created an informal scientific organisation the RNA Tie Club, as suggested by Watson, for scientists of different persuasions who were interested in how proteins were synthesised from genes. However, the club could have only 20 permanent members to represent each of the 20 amino acids; and four additional honorary members to represent the four nucleotides of DNA.[6]\n\n\nThe first scientific contribution of the club, later recorded as \"one of the most important unpublished articles in the history of science\"[7] and \"the most famous unpublished paper in the annals of molecular biology\",[8] was made by Crick. Crick presented a type-written paper titled \"On Degenerate Templates and the Adaptor Hypothesis: A Note for the RNA Tie Club\"[9] to the members of the club in January 1955, which \"totally changed the way we thought about protein synthesis\", as Watson recalled.[10] The hypothesis states that the triplet code was not passed on to amino acids as Gamow thought, but carried by a different molecule, an adaptor, that interacts with amino acids.[8] The adaptor was later identified as tRNA.[11]\n\n\n\n### Codons[edit]\n\n\n\"Codon\" redirects here. For other uses, see Codon (disambiguation).\n\nSee also: DNA and RNA codon tables § Translation table 1\n\nThe Crick, Brenner, Barnett and Watts-Tobin experiment first demonstrated that **codons** consist of three DNA bases. \n\n\nMarshall Nirenberg and Heinrich J. Matthaei were the first to reveal the nature of a codon in 1961.[12] They used a cell-free system to translate a poly-uracil RNA sequence (i.e., UUUUU...) and discovered that the polypeptide that they had synthesized consisted of only the amino acid phenylalanine.[13] They thereby deduced that the codon UUU specified the amino acid phenylalanine.\n\n\nThis was followed by experiments in Severo Ochoa's laboratory that demonstrated that the poly-adenine RNA sequence (AAAAA...) coded for the polypeptide poly-lysine[14] and that the poly-cytosine RNA sequence (CCCCC...) coded for the polypeptide poly-proline.[15] Therefore, the codon AAA specified the amino acid lysine, and the codon CCC specified the amino acid proline. Using various copolymers most of the remaining codons were then determined.\n\n\nSubsequent work by Har Gobind Khorana identified the rest of the genetic code. Shortly thereafter, Robert W. Holley determined the structure of transfer RNA (tRNA), the adapter molecule that facilitates the process of translating RNA into protein. This work was based upon Ochoa's earlier studies, yielding the latter the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for work on the enzymology of RNA synthesis.[16]\n\n\nExtending this work, Nirenberg and Philip Leder revealed the code's triplet nature and deciphered its codons. In these experiments, various combinations of mRNA were passed through a filter that contained ribosomes, the components of cells that translate RNA into protein. Unique triplets promoted the binding of specific tRNAs to the ribosome. Leder and Nirenberg were able to determine the sequences of 54 out of 64 codons in their experiments.[17] Khorana, Holley and Nirenberg received the 1968 Nobel for their work.[18]\n\n\nThe three stop codons were named by discoverers Richard Epstein and Charles Steinberg. \"Amber\" was named after their friend Harris Bernstein, whose last name means \"amber\" in German.[19] The other two stop codons were named \"ochre\" and \"opal\" in order to keep the \"color names\" theme.\n\n\n\n### Expanded genetic codes (synthetic biology)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Expanded genetic code\n\nSee also: Nucleic acid analogues\n\nIn a broad academic audience, the concept of the evolution of the genetic code from the original and ambiguous genetic code to a well-defined (\"frozen\") code with the repertoire of 20 (+2) canonical amino acids is widely accepted.[20]\nHowever, there are different opinions, concepts, approaches and ideas, which is the best way to change it experimentally. Even models are proposed that predict \"entry points\" for synthetic amino acid invasion of the genetic code.[21]\n\n\nSince 2001, 40 non-natural amino acids have been added into proteins by creating a unique codon (recoding) and a corresponding transfer-RNA:aminoacyl – tRNA-synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins.[22][23]\n\n\nH. Murakami and M. Sisido extended some codons to have four and five bases. Steven A. Benner constructed a functional 65th (*in vivo*) codon.[24]\n\n\nIn 2015 N. Budisa, D. Söll and co-workers reported the full substitution of all 20,899 tryptophan residues (UGG codons) with unnatural thienopyrrole-alanine in the genetic code of the bacterium *Escherichia coli*.[25]\n\n\nIn 2016 the first stable semisynthetic organism was created. It was a (single cell) bacterium with two synthetic bases (called X and Y). The bases survived cell division.[26][27]\n\n\nIn 2017, researchers in South Korea reported that they had engineered a mouse with an extended genetic code that can produce proteins with unnatural amino acids.[28]\n\n\nIn May 2019, researchers reported the creation of a new \"Syn61\" strain of the bacterium *Escherichia coli*. This strain has a fully synthetic genome that is refactored (all overlaps expanded), recoded (removing the use of three out of 64 codons completely), and further modified to remove the now unnecessary tRNAs and release factors. It is fully viable and grows 1.6× slower than its wild-type counterpart \"MDS42\".[29][30]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Reading frames in the DNA sequence of a region of the human mitochondrial genome coding for the genes *MT-ATP8* and *MT-ATP6* (in black: positions 8,525 to 8,580 in the sequence accession NC\\_012920[31]). There are three possible reading frames in the 5' → 3' forward direction, starting on the first (+1), second (+2) and third position (+3). For each codon (square brackets), the amino acid is given by the vertebrate mitochondrial code, either in the +1 frame for *MT-ATP8* (in red) or in the +3 frame for *MT-ATP6* (in blue). The *MT-ATP8* genes terminates with the TAG stop codon (red dot) in the +1 frame. The *MT-ATP6* gene starts with the ATG codon (blue circle for the M amino acid) in the +3 frame.\n### Reading frame[edit]\n\n\nA reading frame is defined by the initial triplet of nucleotides from which translation starts. It sets the frame for a run of successive, non-overlapping codons, which is known as an \"open reading frame\" (ORF). For example, the string 5'-AAATGAACG-3' (see figure), if read from the first position, contains the codons AAA, TGA, and ACG ; if read from the second position, it contains the codons AAT and GAA ; and if read from the third position, it contains the codons ATG and AAC. Every sequence can, thus, be read in its 5' → 3' direction in three reading frames, each producing a possibly distinct amino acid sequence: in the given example, Lys (K)-Trp (W)-Thr (T), Asn (N)-Glu (E), or Met (M)-Asn (N), respectively (when translating with the vertebrate mitochondrial code). When DNA is double-stranded, six possible reading frames are defined, three in the forward orientation on one strand and three reverse on the opposite strand.[32]: 330 Protein-coding frames are defined by a start codon, usually the first AUG (ATG) codon in the RNA (DNA) sequence.\n\n\nIn eukaryotes, ORFs in exons are often interrupted by introns.\n\n\n\n### Start and stop codons[edit]\n\n\nTranslation starts with a chain-initiation codon or start codon. The start codon alone is not sufficient to begin the process. Nearby sequences such as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in *E. coli* and initiation factors are also required to start translation. The most common start codon is AUG, which is read as methionine or as formylmethionine (in bacteria, mitochondria, and plastids). Alternative start codons depending on the organism include \"GUG\" or \"UUG\"; these codons normally represent valine and leucine, respectively, but as start codons they are translated as methionine or formylmethionine.[33]\n\n\nThe three stop codons have names: UAG is *amber*, UGA is *opal* (sometimes also called *umber*), and UAA is *ochre*. Stop codons are also called \"termination\" or \"nonsense\" codons. They signal release of the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome because no cognate tRNA has anticodons complementary to these stop signals, allowing a release factor to bind to the ribosome instead.[34]\n\n\n\n### Effect of mutations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Examples of notable mutations that can occur in humans[35]\nDuring the process of DNA replication, errors occasionally occur in the polymerization of the second strand. These errors, mutations, can affect an organism's phenotype, especially if they occur within the protein coding sequence of a gene. Error rates are typically 1 error in every 10–100 million bases—due to the \"proofreading\" ability of DNA polymerases.[36][37]\n\n\nMissense mutations and nonsense mutations are examples of point mutations that can cause genetic diseases such as sickle-cell disease and thalassemia respectively.[38][39][40] Clinically important missense mutations generally change the properties of the coded amino acid residue among basic, acidic, polar or non-polar states, whereas nonsense mutations result in a stop codon.[32]\n\n\nMutations that disrupt the reading frame sequence by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases are known as frameshift mutations. These mutations usually result in a completely different translation from the original, and likely cause a stop codon to be read, which truncates the protein.[41] These mutations may impair the protein's function and are thus rare in *in vivo* protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of frameshift mutations is rare is that, if the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism faces, absence of a functional protein may cause death before the organism becomes viable.[42] Frameshift mutations may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay–Sachs disease.[43]\n\n\nAlthough most mutations that change protein sequences are harmful or neutral, some mutations have benefits.[44] These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation will tend to become more common in a population through natural selection.[45] Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates,[46] which can be an advantage, since these viruses thereby evolve rapidly, and thus evade the immune system defensive responses.[47] In large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, *E. coli*, multiple beneficial mutations may co-occur. This phenomenon is called clonal interference and causes competition among the mutations.[48]\n\n\n\n### Degeneracy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Codon degeneracy\n\n![](image)Grouping of codons by amino acid residue molar volume and hydropathicity. A more detailed version is available.\n![](image)Axes 1, 2, 3 are the first, second, and third positions in the codon. The 20 amino acids and stop codons (X) are shown in single letter code.\nDegeneracy is the redundancy of the genetic code. This term was given by Bernfield and Nirenberg. The genetic code has redundancy but no ambiguity (see the codon tables below for the full correlation). For example, although codons GAA and GAG both specify glutamic acid (redundancy), neither specifies another amino acid (no ambiguity). The codons encoding one amino acid may differ in any of their three positions. For example, the amino acid leucine is specified by **Y**U**R** or CU**N** (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, or CUG) codons (difference in the first or third position indicated using IUPAC notation), while the amino acid serine is specified by UC**N** or AG**Y** (UCA, UCG, UCC, UCU, AGU, or AGC) codons (difference in the first, second, or third position).[49] A practical consequence of redundancy is that errors in the third position of the triplet codon cause only a silent mutation or an error that would not affect the protein because the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity is maintained by equivalent substitution of amino acids; for example, a codon of NUN (where N = any nucleotide) tends to code for hydrophobic amino acids. NCN yields amino acid residues that are small in size and moderate in hydropathicity; NAN encodes average size hydrophilic residues. The genetic code is so well-structured for hydropathicity that a mathematical analysis (Singular Value Decomposition) of 12 variables (4 nucleotides x 3 positions) yields a remarkable correlation (C = 0.95) for predicting the hydropathicity of the encoded amino acid directly from the triplet nucleotide sequence, *without translation.*[50][51] Note in the table, below, eight amino acids are not affected at all by mutations at the third position of the codon, whereas in the figure above, a mutation at the second position is likely to cause a radical change in the physicochemical properties of the encoded amino acid.\nNevertheless, changes in the first position of the codons are more important than changes in the second position on a global scale.[52] The reason may be that charge reversal (from a positive to a negative charge or vice versa) can only occur upon mutations in the first position of certain codons, but not upon changes in the second position of any codon. Such charge reversal may have dramatic consequences for the structure or function of a protein. This aspect may have been largely underestimated by previous studies.[52]\n\n\n\n### Codon usage bias[edit]\n\n\nThe frequency of codons, also known as codon usage bias, can vary from species to species with functional implications for the control of translation. The codon varies by organism; for example, most common proline codon in E. coli is CCG, whereas in humans this is the least used proline codon.[53]\n\n\n\n| Human genome codon frequency table[54]\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Codon | AA[C] | Fraction[D] | Freq ‰[E] | Number[F] |  | Codon | AA | Fraction | Freq ‰ | Number\n |  | Codon | AA | Fraction | Freq ‰ | Number\n |  | Codon | AA | Fraction | Freq ‰ | Number\n |\n| UUU | F | 0.46 | 17.6 | 714,298 | UCU | S | 0.19 | 15.2 | 618,711 | UAU | Y | 0.44 | 12.2 | 495,699 | UGU | C | 0.46 | 10.6 | 430,311\n |\n| UUC | F | 0.54 | 20.3 | 824,692 | UCC | S | 0.22 | 17.7 | 718,892 | UAC | Y | 0.56 | 15.3 | 622,407 | UGC | C | 0.54 | 12.6 | 513,028\n |\n| UUA | L | 0.08 | 7.7 | 311,881 | UCA | S | 0.15 | 12.2 | 496,448 | UAA | \\* | 0.30 | 1.0 | 40,285 | UGA | \\* | 0.47 | 1.6 | 63,237\n |\n| UUG | L | 0.13 | 12.9 | 525,688 | UCG | S | 0.05 | 4.4 | 179,419 | UAG | \\* | 0.24 | 0.8 | 32,109 | UGG | W | 1.00 | 13.2 | 535,595\n |\n| CUU | L | 0.13 | 13.2 | 536,515 | CCU | P | 0.29 | 17.5 | 713,233 | CAU | H | 0.42 | 10.9 | 441,711 | CGU | R | 0.08 | 4.5 | 184,609\n |\n| CUC | L | 0.20 | 19.6 | 796,638 | CCC | P | 0.32 | 19.8 | 804,620 | CAC | H | 0.58 | 15.1 | 613,713 | CGC | R | 0.18 | 10.4 | 423,516\n |\n| CUA | L | 0.07 | 7.2 | 290,751 | CCA | P | 0.28 | 16.9 | 688,038 | CAA | Q | 0.27 | 12.3 | 501,911 | CGA | R | 0.11 | 6.2 | 250,760\n |\n| CUG | L | 0.40 | 39.6 | 1,611,801 | CCG | P | 0.11 | 6.9 | 281,570 | CAG | Q | 0.73 | 34.2 | 1,391,973 | CGG | R | 0.20 | 11.4 | 464,485\n |\n| AUU | I | 0.36 | 16.0 | 650,473 | ACU | T | 0.25 | 13.1 | 533,609 | AAU | N | 0.47 | 17.0 | 689,701 | AGU | S | 0.15 | 12.1 | 493,429\n |\n| AUC | I | 0.47 | 20.8 | 846,466 | ACC | T | 0.36 | 18.9 | 768,147 | AAC | N | 0.53 | 19.1 | 776,603 | AGC | S | 0.24 | 19.5 | 791,383\n |\n| AUA | I | 0.17 | 7.5 | 304,565 | ACA | T | 0.28 | 15.1 | 614,523 | AAA | K | 0.43 | 24.4 | 993,621 | AGA | R | 0.21 | 12.2 | 494,682\n |\n| AUG | M | 1.00 | 22.0 | 896,005 | ACG | T | 0.11 | 6.1 | 246,105 | AAG | K | 0.57 | 31.9 | 1,295,568 | AGG | R | 0.21 | 12.0 | 486,463\n |\n| GUU | V | 0.18 | 11.0 | 448,607 | GCU | A | 0.27 | 18.4 | 750,096 | GAU | D | 0.46 | 21.8 | 885,429 | GGU | G | 0.16 | 10.8 | 437,126\n |\n| GUC | V | 0.24 | 14.5 | 588,138 | GCC | A | 0.40 | 27.7 | 1,127,679 | GAC | D | 0.54 | 25.1 | 1,020,595 | GGC | G | 0.34 | 22.2 | 903,565\n |\n| GUA | V | 0.12 | 7.1 | 287,712 | GCA | A | 0.23 | 15.8 | 643,471 | GAA | E | 0.42 | 29.0 | 1,177,632 | GGA | G | 0.25 | 16.5 | 669,873\n |\n| GUG | V | 0.46 | 28.1 | 1,143,534 | GCG | A | 0.11 | 7.4 | 299,495 | GAG | E | 0.58 | 39.6 | 1,609,975 | GGG | G | 0.25 | 16.5 | 669,768\n |\n\n |\n\n## Alternative genetic codes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: DNA and RNA codon tables § Alternative codons\n\n### Non-standard amino acids[edit]\n\n\nIn some proteins, non-standard amino acids are substituted for standard stop codons, depending on associated signal sequences in the messenger RNA. For example, UGA can code for selenocysteine and UAG can code for pyrrolysine. Selenocysteine came to be seen as the 21st amino acid, and pyrrolysine as the 22nd.[55] Unlike selenocysteine, pyrrolysine-encoded UAG is translated with the participation of a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.[56] Both selenocysteine and pyrrolysine may be present in the same organism.[55] Although the genetic code is normally fixed in an organism, the achaeal prokaryote *Acetohalobium arabaticum* can expand its genetic code from 20 to 21 amino acids (by including pyrrolysine) under different conditions of growth.[57]\n\n\n\n### Variations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of genetic codes\n\n![](image)Genetic code logo of the *Globobulimina pseudospinescens* mitochondrial genome by FACIL.[58] The logo shows the 64 codons from left to right, predicted alternatives in red (relative to the standard genetic code). Red line: stop codons. The height of each amino acid in the stack shows how often it is aligned to the codon in homologous protein domains. The stack height indicates the support for the prediction.\nThere was originally a simple and widely accepted argument that the genetic code should be universal: namely, that any variation in the genetic code would be lethal to the organism (although Crick had stated that viruses were an exception). This is known as the \"frozen accident\" argument for the universality of the genetic code. However, in his seminal paper on the origins of the genetic code in 1968, Francis Crick still stated that the universality of the genetic code in all organisms was an unproven assumption, and was probably not true in some instances. He predicted that \"The code is universal (the same in all organisms) or nearly so\".[59] The first variation was discovered in 1979, by researchers studying human mitochondrial genes.[60] Many slight variants were discovered thereafter,[61] including various alternative mitochondrial codes.[62] These minor variants for example involve translation of the codon UGA as tryptophan in *Mycoplasma* species, and translation of CUG as a serine rather than leucine in yeasts of the \"CTG clade\" (such as *Candida albicans*).[63][64][65] Because viruses must use the same genetic code as their hosts, modifications to the standard genetic code could interfere with viral protein synthesis or functioning. However, viruses such as totiviruses have adapted to the host's genetic code modification.[66] In bacteria and archaea, GUG and UUG are common start codons. In rare cases, certain proteins may use alternative start codons.[61]\nSurprisingly, variations in the interpretation of the genetic code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop codon is naturally used to encode the amino acids tryptophan and arginine.[67] This type of recoding is induced by a high-readthrough stop codon context[68] and it is referred to as *functional translational readthrough*.[69]\n\n\nDespite these differences, all known naturally occurring codes are very similar. The coding mechanism is the same for all organisms: three-base codons, tRNA, ribosomes, single direction reading and translating single codons into single amino acids.[70] The most extreme variations occur in certain ciliates where the meaning of stop codons depends on their position within mRNA. When close to the 3' end they act as terminators while in internal positions they either code for amino acids as in *Condylostoma magnum*[71] or trigger ribosomal frameshifting as in *Euplotes*.[72]\n\n\nThe origins and variation of the genetic code, including the mechanisms behind the evolvability of the genetic code, have been widely studied,[73][74] and some studies have been done experimentally evolving the genetic code of some organisms.[75][76][77][78]\n\n\n\n### Inference[edit]\n\n\nVariant genetic codes used by an organism can be inferred by identifying highly conserved genes encoded in that genome, and comparing its codon usage to the amino acids in homologous proteins of other organisms. For example, the program FACIL infers a genetic code by searching which amino acids in homologous protein domains are most often aligned to every codon. The resulting amino acid (or stop codon) probabilities for each codon are displayed in a genetic code logo.[58]\n\n\nAs of January 2022, the most complete survey of genetic codes is done by Shulgina and Eddy, who screened 250,000 prokaryotic genomes using their Codetta tool. This tool uses a similar approach to FACIL with a larger Pfam database. Despite the NCBI already providing 33 translation tables, the authors were able to find new 5 genetic code variations (corroborated by tRNA mutations) and correct several misattributions.[79]\n\n\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\n\nThe genetic code is a key part of the history of life, according to one version of which self-replicating RNA molecules preceded life as we know it. This is the RNA world hypothesis. Under this hypothesis, any model for the emergence of the genetic code is intimately related to a model of the transfer from ribozymes (RNA enzymes) to proteins as the principal enzymes in cells. In line with the RNA world hypothesis, transfer RNA molecules appear to have evolved before modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, so the latter cannot be part of the explanation of its patterns.[80]\n\n\nA hypothetical randomly evolved genetic code further motivates a biochemical or evolutionary model for its origin. If amino acids were randomly assigned to triplet codons, there would be 1.5 × 1084 possible genetic codes.[81]: 163 This number is found by calculating the number of ways that 21 items (20 amino acids plus one stop) can be placed in 64 bins, wherein each item is used at least once.[82] However, the distribution of codon assignments in the genetic code is nonrandom.[83] In particular, the genetic code clusters certain amino acid assignments.\n\n\nAmino acids that share the same biosynthetic pathway tend to have the same first base in their codons. This could be an evolutionary relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids.[84] It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons,[85][86] reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.[83]\n\n\nGiven the non-random genetic triplet coding scheme, a tenable hypothesis for the origin of genetic code could address multiple aspects of the codon table, such as absence of codons for D-amino acids, secondary codon patterns for some amino acids, confinement of synonymous positions to third position, the small set of only 20 amino acids (instead of a number approaching 64), and the relation of stop codon patterns to amino acid coding patterns.[87]\n\n\nThree main hypotheses address the origin of the genetic code. Many models belong to one of them or to a hybrid:[88]\n\n\n\n* Random freeze: the genetic code was randomly created. For example, early tRNA-like ribozymes may have had different affinities for amino acids, with codons emerging from another part of the ribozyme that exhibited random variability. Once enough peptides were coded for, any major random change in the genetic code would have been lethal; hence it became \"frozen\".[89]\n* Stereochemical affinity: the genetic code is a result of a high affinity between each amino acid and its codon or anti-codon; the latter option implies that pre-tRNA molecules matched their corresponding amino acids by this affinity. Later during evolution, this matching was gradually replaced with matching by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.[87][90][91]\n* Optimality: the genetic code continued to evolve after its initial creation, so that the current code maximizes some fitness function, usually some kind of error minimization.[87][88][92]\n\n\nHypotheses have addressed a variety of scenarios:[93]\n\n\n\n* Chemical principles govern specific RNA interaction with amino acids. Experiments with aptamers showed that some amino acids have a selective chemical affinity for their codons.[94] Experiments showed that of 8 amino acids tested, 6 show some RNA triplet-amino acid association.[81][91]\n* Biosynthetic expansion. The genetic code grew from a simpler earlier code through a process of \"biosynthetic expansion\". Primordial life \"discovered\" new amino acids (for example, as by-products of metabolism) and later incorporated some of these into the machinery of genetic coding.[95] Although much circumstantial evidence has been found to suggest that fewer amino acid types were used in the past,[96] precise and detailed hypotheses about which amino acids entered the code in what order are controversial.[97][98] However, several studies have suggested that Gly, Ala, Asp, Val, Ser, Pro, Glu, Leu, Thr may belong to a group of early-addition amino acids, whereas Cys, Met, Tyr, Trp, His, Phe may belong to a group of later-addition amino acids.[99][100][101][102]\n* Natural selection has led to codon assignments of the genetic code that minimize the effects of mutations.[103] A recent hypothesis[104] suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used longer than triplet codons (such as quadruplet codons). Longer than triplet decoding would increase codon redundancy and would be more error resistant. This feature could allow accurate decoding absent complex translational machinery such as the ribosome, such as before cells began making ribosomes.\n* Information channels: Information-theoretic approaches model the process of translating the genetic code into corresponding amino acids as an error-prone information channel.[105] The inherent noise (that is, the error) in the channel poses the organism with a fundamental question: how can a genetic code be constructed to withstand noise[106] while accurately and efficiently translating information? These \"rate-distortion\" models[107] suggest that the genetic code originated as a result of the interplay of the three conflicting evolutionary forces: the needs for diverse amino acids,[108] for error-tolerance[103] and for minimal resource cost. The code emerges at a transition when the mapping of codons to amino acids becomes nonrandom. The code's emergence is governed by the topology defined by the probable errors and is related to the map coloring problem.[109]\n* Game theory: Models based on signaling games combine elements of game theory, natural selection and information channels. Such models have been used to suggest that the first polypeptides were likely short and had non-enzymatic function. Game theoretic models suggested that the organization of RNA strings into cells may have been necessary to prevent \"deceptive\" use of the genetic code, i.e. preventing the ancient equivalent of viruses from overwhelming the RNA world.[110]\n* Stop codons: Codons for translational stops are also an interesting aspect to the problem of the origin of the genetic code. As an example for addressing stop codon evolution, it has been suggested that the stop codons are such that they are most likely to terminate translation early in the case of a frame shift error.[111] In contrast, some stereochemical molecular models explain the origin of stop codons as \"unassignable\".[87]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of genetic engineering software\n* Codon tables\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Turanov AA, Lobanov AV, Fomenko DE, Morrison HG, Sogin ML, Klobutcher LA, Hatfield DL, Gladyshev VN (January 2009). \"Genetic code supports targeted insertion of two amino acids by one codon\". *Science*. **323** (5911): 259–61. doi:10.1126/science.1164748.

Of the 21 amino acids common to all life forms, the nine amino acids humans cannot synthesize are valine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, threonine, histidine, and lysine.[1][2]\n\n\nSix other amino acids are considered **conditionally essential** in the human diet, meaning their synthesis can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions, such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress.[2] These six are arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamine, proline, and tyrosine. Six amino acids are non-essential (**dispensable**) in humans, meaning they can be synthesized in sufficient quantities in the body. These six are alanine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, serine,[2] and selenocysteine (considered the 21st amino acid). Pyrrolysine (considered the 22nd amino acid),[3] which is proteinogenic only in certain microorganisms, is not used by and therefore non-essential for most organisms, including humans.\n\n\nThe **limiting amino acid** is the essential amino acid which is furthest from meeting nutritional requirements.[4] This concept is important when determining the selection, number, and amount of foods to consume because even when total protein and all other essential amino acids are satisfied if the limiting amino acid is not satisfied then the meal is considered to be nutritionally limited by that amino acid.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Essentiality in humans[edit]\n\n\nOf the twenty amino acids common to all life forms (not counting selenocysteine), humans cannot synthesize nine: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine. Additionally, the amino acids arginine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, proline and tyrosine are considered **conditionally essential**,[5] which means that specific populations who do not synthesize it in adequate amounts, such as new born infants and people with diseased livers who are unable to synthesize cysteine, must obtain one or more of these conditionally essential amino acids from their diet.[6][7] For example, enough arginine is synthesized by the urea cycle to meet the needs of an adult but perhaps not those of a growing child. Amino acids that must be obtained from the diet are called **essential amino acids**. \n\n\n\n\n\n| Essential\n | Conditionally essential[8][9] | Non-essential\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Histidine (H)\n | Arginine (R)\n | Alanine (A)\n |\n| Isoleucine (I)\n | Cysteine (C)\n | Aspartic acid (D)\n |\n| Leucine (L)\n | Glutamine (Q)\n | Asparagine (N)\n |\n| Lysine (K)\n | Glycine (G)\n | Glutamic acid (E)\n |\n| Methionine (M)\n | Proline (P)\n | Serine (S)\n |\n| Phenylalanine (F)\n | Tyrosine (Y)\n | Selenocysteine (U)\n |\n| Threonine (T)\n |  | Pyrrolysine\\* (O)\n |\n| Tryptophan (W)\n |  |  |\n| Valine (V)\n |  |  |\n\n\n(\\*) Pyrrolysine, sometimes considered the \"22nd amino acid\", is not used by the human body.[10]\n\n\nEukaryotes can synthesize some of the amino acids from other substrates. Consequently, only a subset of the amino acids used in protein synthesis are essential nutrients.\n\n\n\n## From intermediates of the citric acid cycle and other pathways[edit]\n\n\nNonessential amino acids are produced in the body. The pathways for the synthesis of nonessential amino acids come from basic metabolic pathways. Glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reductive amination of α-ketoglutarate to glutamate. A transamination reaction takes place in the synthesis of most amino acids. At this step, the chirality of the amino acid is established. Alanine and aspartate are synthesized by the transamination of pyruvate and oxaloacetate, respectively. Glutamine is synthesized from NH4+ and glutamate, and asparagine is synthesized similarly. Proline and arginine are both derived from glutamate. Serine, formed from 3-phosphoglycerate, which comes from glycolysis, is the precursor of glycine and cysteine. Tyrosine is synthesized by the hydroxylation of phenylalanine, which is an essential amino acid.\n\n\n\n## Recommended daily intake[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Protein (nutrient)\n\nEstimating the daily requirement for the indispensable amino acids has proven to be difficult; these numbers have undergone considerable revision over the last 20 years. The following table lists the recommended daily amounts currently in use for essential amino acids in **adult humans** (unless specified otherwise), together with their standard one-letter abbreviations.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Amino acid(s)\n | Daily intake in mg per kg body mass\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| WHO[11] | US NAM[12] | FAO (2018) young children catch-up growth[13] |\n| **H** Histidine | 10\n | 14\n | 66\n |\n| **I** Isoleucine | 20\n | 19\n | 95\n |\n| **L** Leucine | 39\n | 42\n | 198\n |\n| **K** Lysine | 30\n | 38\n | 183\n |\n| **M** Methionine+ **C** Cysteine | 10.4 + 4.1(14.5 total)\n | 19 total\n | 88\n |\n| **F** Phenylalanine+ **Y** Tyrosine | 25 (total)\n | 33 total\n | 177\n |\n| **T** Threonine | 15\n | 20\n | 103\n |\n| **W** Tryptophan | 4\n | 5\n | 29\n |\n| **V** Valine | 26\n | 24\n | 130\n |\n\n\nThe recommended daily intakes for children aged three years and older is 10% to 20% higher than adult levels and those for infants can be as much as 150% higher in the first year of life. Cysteine (or sulfur-containing amino acids), tyrosine (or aromatic amino acids), and arginine are always required by infants and growing children.[11][14] Methionine and cysteine are grouped together because one of them can be synthesized from the other using the enzyme methionine *S*-methyltransferase and the catalyst methionine synthase.[15] Phenylalanine and tyrosine are grouped together because one of them can be synthesized from the other using the enzyme phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia-lyase.[16]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Amino acid requirements and the amino acid content of food[edit]\n\n\nHistorically, amino acid requirements were determined by calculating the balance between dietary Nitrogen intake and nitrogen excreted in the liquid and solid wastes because proteins represent the largest nitrogen content in a body. A positive balance is where more nitrogen is consumed than is excreted which indicates that some of the nitrogen is being used by the body to build proteins. A negative nitrogen balance is where more nitrogen is excreted than is consumed which indicates that there is insufficient intake for the body to maintain its health. Graduate students at the University of Illinois were fed an artificial diet so that there was a slightly positive nitrogen balance. Then one amino acid was omitted and the nitrogen balance recorded. If a positive balance continued then that amino acid was deemed not essential. If a negative balance occurred then that amino acid was slowly restored until a slightly positive nitrogen balance stabilized and the minimum amount recorded.[17][18]\n\n\nA similar method was used to determine the protein content of foods. Test subjects were fed a diet containing no protein and the nitrogen losses recorded. During the first week or more there is a rapid loss of labile proteins. Once the nitrogen losses stabilized this baseline is determined to be the minimum required for maintenance. Then the test subjects were fed a measured amount of the food being tested. The difference between the nitrogen in that food and the nitrogen losses above baseline was the amount the body retained to rebuild proteins. The amount of nitrogen retained divided by the total nitrogen intake is called net protein utilization. The amount of nitrogen retained divided by the (nitrogen intake minus nitrogen loss above baseline) is called Biological Value and is usually given as a percentage.[18]\n\n\nModern techniques make use of Ion Exchange Chromatography to determine the actual amino acid content of foods. The USDA used this technique in their own labs to determine the content of 7793 foods across 28 categories and published the final database in 2018 to the public.[19]\n\n\nThe limiting amino acid depends on the human requirements and there are currently two sets of human requirements from authoritative sources: one published by WHO[11] and the other published by USDA.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table displays the number of Items in each Category with the same limiting Essential Amino Acid [11] [12] [19]\n|  | Based on WHO Requirements\n |  | Based on USDA Requirements\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Category\n | Tryptophan\n | Threonine\n | Isoleucine\n | Leucine\n | Lysine\n | Methionine+Cystine\n | Phenylalanine+Tyrosine\n | Valine\n | Histidine\n |  | Tryptophan\n | Threonine\n | Isoleucine\n | Leucine\n | Lysine\n | Methionine+Cystine\n | Phenylalanine+Tyrosine\n | Valine\n | Histidine\n |\n| American Indian/Alaska Native Foods\n | 4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 10\n | 4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 15\n | 0\n |  | 7\n | 2\n | 0\n | 3\n | 6\n | 5\n | 0\n | 0\n | 10\n |\n| Baby Foods\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 7\n | 35\n | 8\n | 0\n | 11\n | 1\n |  | 5\n | 1\n | 0\n | 5\n | 34\n | 13\n | 0\n | 0\n | 7\n |\n| Baked Products\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n | 5\n | 338\n | 1\n | 0\n | 5\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 339\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 9\n |\n| Beef Products\n | 276\n | 0\n | 6\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 649\n | 2\n |  | 289\n | 1\n | 0\n | 176\n | 6\n | 300\n | 0\n | 159\n | 4\n |\n| Beverages\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n | 11\n | 5\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 12\n | 5\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n |\n| Breakfast Cereals\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n | 40\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |  | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n | 40\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Cereal Grains and Pasta\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 9\n | 143\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 1\n |  | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 4\n | 148\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Dairy and Egg Products\n | 19\n | 6\n | 4\n | 21\n | 16\n | 122\n | 0\n | 12\n | 3\n |  | 19\n | 19\n | 0\n | 0\n | 11\n | 122\n | 0\n | 0\n | 32\n |\n| Fast Foods\n | 4\n | 3\n | 0\n | 9\n | 39\n | 8\n | 0\n | 62\n | 1\n |  | 6\n | 4\n | 0\n | 10\n | 82\n | 15\n | 0\n | 1\n | 8\n |\n| Fats and Oils\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 4\n | 4\n | 4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |  | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 6\n |\n| Finfish and Shellfish Products\n | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 15\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 228\n | 0\n |  | 5\n | 3\n | 0\n | 174\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 67\n |\n| Fruits and Fruit Juices\n | 15\n | 0\n | 9\n | 54\n | 12\n | 31\n | 3\n | 3\n | 14\n |  | 15\n | 1\n | 7\n | 40\n | 11\n | 35\n | 3\n | 1\n | 28\n |\n| Lamb\n | 10\n | 0\n | 5\n | 254\n | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 155\n | 0\n |  | 10\n | 0\n | 2\n | 207\n | 9\n | 112\n | 0\n | 2\n | 87\n |\n| Legumes and Legume Products\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 26\n | 154\n | 0\n | 22\n | 0\n |  | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 27\n | 175\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Meals\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 15\n | 0\n | 0\n | 14\n | 0\n |  | 2\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | 24\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Nut and Seed Products\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 24\n | 96\n | 8\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |  | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 13\n | 103\n | 10\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n |\n| Pork Products\n | 11\n | 0\n | 1\n | 54\n | 0\n | 2\n | 0\n | 249\n | 0\n |  | 20\n | 0\n | 0\n | 197\n | 0\n | 73\n | 0\n | 15\n | 12\n |\n| Poultry Products\n | 6\n | 12\n | 6\n | 58\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 287\n | 0\n |  | 36\n | 22\n | 0\n | 167\n | 5\n | 8\n | 0\n | 99\n | 33\n |\n| Restaurant Foods\n | 0\n | 9\n | 3\n | 14\n | 24\n | 3\n | 0\n | 41\n | 1\n |  | 1\n | 25\n | 0\n | 9\n | 33\n | 12\n | 0\n | 0\n | 15\n |\n| Sausages and Luncheon Meats\n | 5\n | 0\n | 1\n | 31\n | 0\n | 2\n | 0\n | 78\n | 0\n |  | 14\n | 11\n | 1\n | 68\n | 1\n | 11\n | 0\n | 4\n | 7\n |\n| Snacks\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 6\n | 83\n | 6\n | 0\n | 4\n | 1\n |  | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 6\n | 81\n | 9\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n |\n| Soups\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n | 7\n | 10\n | 28\n | 0\n | 7\n | 0\n |  | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 21\n | 31\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Spices and Herbs\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 6\n | 11\n | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n |  | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 3\n | 12\n | 4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Sweets\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n | 3\n | 17\n | 47\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n |  | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 17\n | 47\n | 0\n | 0\n | 5\n |\n| Vegetables and Vegetable Products\n | 7\n | 0\n | 8\n | 238\n | 114\n | 199\n | 0\n | 18\n | 19\n |  | 13\n | 28\n | 0\n | 112\n | 144\n | 246\n | 0\n | 2\n | 58\n |\n\n\n### Protein quality[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Protein quality\n\nVarious attempts have been made to express the \"quality\" or \"value\" of various kinds of protein. Measures include the biological value, net protein utilization, protein efficiency ratio, protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score and complete proteins concept. These concepts are important in the livestock industry, because the relative lack of one or more of the essential amino acids in animal feeds would have a limiting effect on growth and thus on feed conversion ratio. Thus, various feedstuffs may be fed in combination to increase net protein utilization, or a supplement of an individual amino acid (methionine, lysine, threonine, or tryptophan) can be added to the feed.\n\n\n\n### Protein per calorie[edit]\n\n\nProtein content in foods is often measured in protein per serving rather than protein per calorie. For instance, the USDA lists 6 grams of protein per large whole egg (a 50-gram serving) rather than 84 mg of protein per calorie (71 calories total).[20] For comparison, there are 2.8 grams of protein in a serving of raw broccoli (100 grams) or 82 mg of protein per calorie (34 calories total), or the Daily Value of 47.67g of protein after eating 1,690g of raw broccoli a day at 574 cal.[21] An egg contains 12.5g of protein per 100g, but 4 mg more protein per calorie, or the protein DV after 381g of egg, which is 545 cal.[22] The ratio of essential amino acids (the quality of protein) is not taken into account, one would actually need to eat more than 3 kg of broccoli a day to have a healthy protein profile, and almost 6 kg to get enough calories.[21] It is recommended that adult humans obtain between 10–35% of their 2000 calories a day as protein.[23]\n\n\n\n## Complete proteins in non-human animals[edit]\n\n\nScientists had known since the early 20th century that rats could not survive on a diet whose only protein source was zein, which comes from maize (corn), but recovered if they were fed casein from cow's milk. This led William Cumming Rose to the discovery of the essential amino acid threonine.[24] Through manipulation of rodent diets, Rose was able to show that ten amino acids are essential for rats: lysine, tryptophan, histidine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, valine, and arginine, in addition to threonine. Rose's later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings, with histidine also being essential for infants. Longer-term studies established histidine as also essential for adult humans.[25]\n\n\n\n## Interchangeability[edit]\n\n\nThe distinction between essential and non-essential amino acids is somewhat unclear, as some amino acids can be produced from others. The sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and homocysteine, can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized *de novo* in humans. Likewise, cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own. So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the aromatic amino acid pair, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Likewise arginine, ornithine, and citrulline, which are interconvertible by the urea cycle, are considered a single group.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Effects of deficiency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Protein-energy malnutrition\n\nIf one of the essential amino acids is not available in the required quantities, protein synthesis will be inhibited, irrespective of the availability of the other amino acids.[2] Protein deficiency has been shown to affect all of the body's organs and many of its systems, for example affecting brain development in infants and young children; inhibiting upkeep of the immune system, increasing risk of infection; affecting gut mucosal function and permeability, thereby reducing absorption and increasing vulnerability to systemic disease; and impacting kidney function.[2] The physical signs of protein deficiency include edema, failure to thrive in infants and children, poor musculature, dull skin, and thin and fragile hair. Biochemical changes reflecting protein deficiency include low serum albumin and low serum transferrin.[2]\n\n\nThe amino acids that are essential in the human diet were established in a series of experiments led by William Cumming Rose. The experiments involved elemental diets to healthy male graduate students. These diets consisted of corn starch, sucrose, butterfat without protein, corn oil, inorganic salts, the known vitamins, a large brown \"candy\" made of liver extract flavored with peppermint oil (to supply any unknown vitamins), and mixtures of highly purified individual amino acids. The main outcome measure was nitrogen balance. Rose noted that the symptoms of nervousness, exhaustion, and dizziness were encountered to a greater or lesser extent whenever human subjects were deprived of an essential amino acid.[17]\n\n\nEssential amino acid deficiency should be distinguished from protein-energy malnutrition, which can manifest as marasmus or kwashiorkor. Kwashiorkor was once attributed to pure protein deficiency in individuals who were consuming enough calories (\"sugar baby syndrome\"). However, this theory has been challenged by the finding that there is no difference in the diets of children developing marasmus as opposed to kwashiorkor.[26] Still, for instance in Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) maintained by the USDA, lack of one or more of the essential amino acids is described as protein-energy malnutrition.[2]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Biological Value (BV)\n* Essential fatty acid\n* Essential genes\n* List of standard amino acids\n* Low-protein diet\n* Orthomolecular medicine\n* Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score\n* Ketogenic amino acid\n* Glucogenic amino acid\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Young VR (1994). \"Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations\". *J.

Of the 21 amino acids common to all life forms, the nine amino acids humans cannot synthesize are valine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, threonine, histidine, and lysine.[1][2]\n\n\nSix other amino acids are considered **conditionally essential** in the human diet, meaning their synthesis can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions, such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress.[2] These six are arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamine, proline, and tyrosine. Six amino acids are non-essential (**dispensable**) in humans, meaning they can be synthesized in sufficient quantities in the body. These six are alanine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, serine,[2] and selenocysteine (considered the 21st amino acid). Pyrrolysine (considered the 22nd amino acid),[3] which is proteinogenic only in certain microorganisms, is not used by and therefore non-essential for most organisms, including humans.\n\n\nThe **limiting amino acid** is the essential amino acid which is furthest from meeting nutritional requirements.[4] This concept is important when determining the selection, number, and amount of foods to consume because even when total protein and all other essential amino acids are satisfied if the limiting amino acid is not satisfied then the meal is considered to be nutritionally limited by that amino acid.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Essentiality in humans[edit]\n\n\nOf the twenty amino acids common to all life forms (not counting selenocysteine), humans cannot synthesize nine: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine. Additionally, the amino acids arginine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, proline and tyrosine are considered **conditionally essential**,[5] which means that specific populations who do not synthesize it in adequate amounts, such as new born infants and people with diseased livers who are unable to synthesize cysteine, must obtain one or more of these conditionally essential amino acids from their diet.[6][7] For example, enough arginine is synthesized by the urea cycle to meet the needs of an adult but perhaps not those of a growing child. Amino acids that must be obtained from the diet are called **essential amino acids**. \n\n\n\n\n\n| Essential\n | Conditionally essential[8][9] | Non-essential\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Histidine (H)\n | Arginine (R)\n | Alanine (A)\n |\n| Isoleucine (I)\n | Cysteine (C)\n | Aspartic acid (D)\n |\n| Leucine (L)\n | Glutamine (Q)\n | Asparagine (N)\n |\n| Lysine (K)\n | Glycine (G)\n | Glutamic acid (E)\n |\n| Methionine (M)\n | Proline (P)\n | Serine (S)\n |\n| Phenylalanine (F)\n | Tyrosine (Y)\n | Selenocysteine (U)\n |\n| Threonine (T)\n |  | Pyrrolysine\\* (O)\n |\n| Tryptophan (W)\n |  |  |\n| Valine (V)\n |  |  |\n\n\n(\\*) Pyrrolysine, sometimes considered the \"22nd amino acid\", is not used by the human body.[10]\n\n\nEukaryotes can synthesize some of the amino acids from other substrates. Consequently, only a subset of the amino acids used in protein synthesis are essential nutrients.\n\n\n\n## From intermediates of the citric acid cycle and other pathways[edit]\n\n\nNonessential amino acids are produced in the body. The pathways for the synthesis of nonessential amino acids come from basic metabolic pathways. Glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reductive amination of α-ketoglutarate to glutamate. A transamination reaction takes place in the synthesis of most amino acids. At this step, the chirality of the amino acid is established. Alanine and aspartate are synthesized by the transamination of pyruvate and oxaloacetate, respectively. Glutamine is synthesized from NH4+ and glutamate, and asparagine is synthesized similarly. Proline and arginine are both derived from glutamate. Serine, formed from 3-phosphoglycerate, which comes from glycolysis, is the precursor of glycine and cysteine. Tyrosine is synthesized by the hydroxylation of phenylalanine, which is an essential amino acid.\n\n\n\n## Recommended daily intake[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Protein (nutrient)\n\nEstimating the daily requirement for the indispensable amino acids has proven to be difficult; these numbers have undergone considerable revision over the last 20 years. The following table lists the recommended daily amounts currently in use for essential amino acids in **adult humans** (unless specified otherwise), together with their standard one-letter abbreviations.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Amino acid(s)\n | Daily intake in mg per kg body mass\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| WHO[11] | US NAM[12] | FAO (2018) young children catch-up growth[13] |\n| **H** Histidine | 10\n | 14\n | 66\n |\n| **I** Isoleucine | 20\n | 19\n | 95\n |\n| **L** Leucine | 39\n | 42\n | 198\n |\n| **K** Lysine | 30\n | 38\n | 183\n |\n| **M** Methionine+ **C** Cysteine | 10.4 + 4.1(14.5 total)\n | 19 total\n | 88\n |\n| **F** Phenylalanine+ **Y** Tyrosine | 25 (total)\n | 33 total\n | 177\n |\n| **T** Threonine | 15\n | 20\n | 103\n |\n| **W** Tryptophan | 4\n | 5\n | 29\n |\n| **V** Valine | 26\n | 24\n | 130\n |\n\n\nThe recommended daily intakes for children aged three years and older is 10% to 20% higher than adult levels and those for infants can be as much as 150% higher in the first year of life. Cysteine (or sulfur-containing amino acids), tyrosine (or aromatic amino acids), and arginine are always required by infants and growing children.[11][14] Methionine and cysteine are grouped together because one of them can be synthesized from the other using the enzyme methionine *S*-methyltransferase and the catalyst methionine synthase.[15] Phenylalanine and tyrosine are grouped together because one of them can be synthesized from the other using the enzyme phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia-lyase.[16]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Amino acid requirements and the amino acid content of food[edit]\n\n\nHistorically, amino acid requirements were determined by calculating the balance between dietary Nitrogen intake and nitrogen excreted in the liquid and solid wastes because proteins represent the largest nitrogen content in a body. A positive balance is where more nitrogen is consumed than is excreted which indicates that some of the nitrogen is being used by the body to build proteins. A negative nitrogen balance is where more nitrogen is excreted than is consumed which indicates that there is insufficient intake for the body to maintain its health. Graduate students at the University of Illinois were fed an artificial diet so that there was a slightly positive nitrogen balance. Then one amino acid was omitted and the nitrogen balance recorded. If a positive balance continued then that amino acid was deemed not essential. If a negative balance occurred then that amino acid was slowly restored until a slightly positive nitrogen balance stabilized and the minimum amount recorded.[17][18]\n\n\nA similar method was used to determine the protein content of foods. Test subjects were fed a diet containing no protein and the nitrogen losses recorded. During the first week or more there is a rapid loss of labile proteins. Once the nitrogen losses stabilized this baseline is determined to be the minimum required for maintenance. Then the test subjects were fed a measured amount of the food being tested. The difference between the nitrogen in that food and the nitrogen losses above baseline was the amount the body retained to rebuild proteins. The amount of nitrogen retained divided by the total nitrogen intake is called net protein utilization. The amount of nitrogen retained divided by the (nitrogen intake minus nitrogen loss above baseline) is called Biological Value and is usually given as a percentage.[18]\n\n\nModern techniques make use of Ion Exchange Chromatography to determine the actual amino acid content of foods. The USDA used this technique in their own labs to determine the content of 7793 foods across 28 categories and published the final database in 2018 to the public.[19]\n\n\nThe limiting amino acid depends on the human requirements and there are currently two sets of human requirements from authoritative sources: one published by WHO[11] and the other published by USDA.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table displays the number of Items in each Category with the same limiting Essential Amino Acid [11] [12] [19]\n|  | Based on WHO Requirements\n |  | Based on USDA Requirements\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Category\n | Tryptophan\n | Threonine\n | Isoleucine\n | Leucine\n | Lysine\n | Methionine+Cystine\n | Phenylalanine+Tyrosine\n | Valine\n | Histidine\n |  | Tryptophan\n | Threonine\n | Isoleucine\n | Leucine\n | Lysine\n | Methionine+Cystine\n | Phenylalanine+Tyrosine\n | Valine\n | Histidine\n |\n| American Indian/Alaska Native Foods\n | 4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 10\n | 4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 15\n | 0\n |  | 7\n | 2\n | 0\n | 3\n | 6\n | 5\n | 0\n | 0\n | 10\n |\n| Baby Foods\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 7\n | 35\n | 8\n | 0\n | 11\n | 1\n |  | 5\n | 1\n | 0\n | 5\n | 34\n | 13\n | 0\n | 0\n | 7\n |\n| Baked Products\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n | 5\n | 338\n | 1\n | 0\n | 5\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 339\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 9\n |\n| Beef Products\n | 276\n | 0\n | 6\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 649\n | 2\n |  | 289\n | 1\n | 0\n | 176\n | 6\n | 300\n | 0\n | 159\n | 4\n |\n| Beverages\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n | 11\n | 5\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 12\n | 5\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n |\n| Breakfast Cereals\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n | 40\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |  | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n | 40\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Cereal Grains and Pasta\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 9\n | 143\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 1\n |  | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 4\n | 148\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Dairy and Egg Products\n | 19\n | 6\n | 4\n | 21\n | 16\n | 122\n | 0\n | 12\n | 3\n |  | 19\n | 19\n | 0\n | 0\n | 11\n | 122\n | 0\n | 0\n | 32\n |\n| Fast Foods\n | 4\n | 3\n | 0\n | 9\n | 39\n | 8\n | 0\n | 62\n | 1\n |  | 6\n | 4\n | 0\n | 10\n | 82\n | 15\n | 0\n | 1\n | 8\n |\n| Fats and Oils\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 4\n | 4\n | 4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |  | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 6\n |\n| Finfish and Shellfish Products\n | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 15\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 228\n | 0\n |  | 5\n | 3\n | 0\n | 174\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 67\n |\n| Fruits and Fruit Juices\n | 15\n | 0\n | 9\n | 54\n | 12\n | 31\n | 3\n | 3\n | 14\n |  | 15\n | 1\n | 7\n | 40\n | 11\n | 35\n | 3\n | 1\n | 28\n |\n| Lamb\n | 10\n | 0\n | 5\n | 254\n | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 155\n | 0\n |  | 10\n | 0\n | 2\n | 207\n | 9\n | 112\n | 0\n | 2\n | 87\n |\n| Legumes and Legume Products\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 26\n | 154\n | 0\n | 22\n | 0\n |  | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 27\n | 175\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Meals\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 15\n | 0\n | 0\n | 14\n | 0\n |  | 2\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | 24\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n |\n| Nut and Seed Products\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 24\n | 96\n | 8\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n |  | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 13\n | 103\n | 10\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n |\n| Pork Products\n | 11\n | 0\n | 1\n | 54\n | 0\n | 2\n | 0\n | 249\n | 0\n |  | 20\n | 0\n | 0\n | 197\n | 0\n | 73\n | 0\n | 15\n | 12\n |\n| Poultry Products\n | 6\n | 12\n | 6\n | 58\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 287\n | 0\n |  | 36\n | 22\n | 0\n | 167\n | 5\n | 8\n | 0\n | 99\n | 33\n |\n| Restaurant Foods\n | 0\n | 9\n | 3\n | 14\n | 24\n | 3\n | 0\n | 41\n | 1\n |  | 1\n | 25\n | 0\n | 9\n | 33\n | 12\n | 0\n | 0\n | 15\n |\n| Sausages and Luncheon Meats\n | 5\n | 0\n | 1\n | 31\n | 0\n | 2\n | 0\n | 78\n | 0\n |  | 14\n | 11\n | 1\n | 68\n | 1\n | 11\n | 0\n | 4\n | 7\n |\n| Snacks\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 6\n | 83\n | 6\n | 0\n | 4\n | 1\n |  | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 6\n | 81\n | 9\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n |\n| Soups\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n | 7\n | 10\n | 28\n | 0\n | 7\n | 0\n |  | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 21\n | 31\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Spices and Herbs\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 6\n | 11\n | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n |  | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 3\n | 12\n | 4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Sweets\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n | 3\n | 17\n | 47\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n |  | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n | 17\n | 47\n | 0\n | 0\n | 5\n |\n| Vegetables and Vegetable Products\n | 7\n | 0\n | 8\n | 238\n | 114\n | 199\n | 0\n | 18\n | 19\n |  | 13\n | 28\n | 0\n | 112\n | 144\n | 246\n | 0\n | 2\n | 58\n |\n\n\n### Protein quality[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Protein quality\n\nVarious attempts have been made to express the \"quality\" or \"value\" of various kinds of protein. Measures include the biological value, net protein utilization, protein efficiency ratio, protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score and complete proteins concept. These concepts are important in the livestock industry, because the relative lack of one or more of the essential amino acids in animal feeds would have a limiting effect on growth and thus on feed conversion ratio. Thus, various feedstuffs may be fed in combination to increase net protein utilization, or a supplement of an individual amino acid (methionine, lysine, threonine, or tryptophan) can be added to the feed.\n\n\n\n### Protein per calorie[edit]\n\n\nProtein content in foods is often measured in protein per serving rather than protein per calorie. For instance, the USDA lists 6 grams of protein per large whole egg (a 50-gram serving) rather than 84 mg of protein per calorie (71 calories total).[20] For comparison, there are 2.8 grams of protein in a serving of raw broccoli (100 grams) or 82 mg of protein per calorie (34 calories total), or the Daily Value of 47.67g of protein after eating 1,690g of raw broccoli a day at 574 cal.[21] An egg contains 12.5g of protein per 100g, but 4 mg more protein per calorie, or the protein DV after 381g of egg, which is 545 cal.[22] The ratio of essential amino acids (the quality of protein) is not taken into account, one would actually need to eat more than 3 kg of broccoli a day to have a healthy protein profile, and almost 6 kg to get enough calories.[21] It is recommended that adult humans obtain between 10–35% of their 2000 calories a day as protein.[23]\n\n\n\n## Complete proteins in non-human animals[edit]\n\n\nScientists had known since the early 20th century that rats could not survive on a diet whose only protein source was zein, which comes from maize (corn), but recovered if they were fed casein from cow's milk. This led William Cumming Rose to the discovery of the essential amino acid threonine.[24] Through manipulation of rodent diets, Rose was able to show that ten amino acids are essential for rats: lysine, tryptophan, histidine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, valine, and arginine, in addition to threonine. Rose's later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings, with histidine also being essential for infants. Longer-term studies established histidine as also essential for adult humans.[25]\n\n\n\n## Interchangeability[edit]\n\n\nThe distinction between essential and non-essential amino acids is somewhat unclear, as some amino acids can be produced from others. The sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and homocysteine, can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized *de novo* in humans. Likewise, cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own. So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the aromatic amino acid pair, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Likewise arginine, ornithine, and citrulline, which are interconvertible by the urea cycle, are considered a single group.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Effects of deficiency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Protein-energy malnutrition\n\nIf one of the essential amino acids is not available in the required quantities, protein synthesis will be inhibited, irrespective of the availability of the other amino acids.[2] Protein deficiency has been shown to affect all of the body's organs and many of its systems, for example affecting brain development in infants and young children; inhibiting upkeep of the immune system, increasing risk of infection; affecting gut mucosal function and permeability, thereby reducing absorption and increasing vulnerability to systemic disease; and impacting kidney function.[2] The physical signs of protein deficiency include edema, failure to thrive in infants and children, poor musculature, dull skin, and thin and fragile hair. Biochemical changes reflecting protein deficiency include low serum albumin and low serum transferrin.[2]\n\n\nThe amino acids that are essential in the human diet were established in a series of experiments led by William Cumming Rose. The experiments involved elemental diets to healthy male graduate students. These diets consisted of corn starch, sucrose, butterfat without protein, corn oil, inorganic salts, the known vitamins, a large brown \"candy\" made of liver extract flavored with peppermint oil (to supply any unknown vitamins), and mixtures of highly purified individual amino acids. The main outcome measure was nitrogen balance. Rose noted that the symptoms of nervousness, exhaustion, and dizziness were encountered to a greater or lesser extent whenever human subjects were deprived of an essential amino acid.[17]\n\n\nEssential amino acid deficiency should be distinguished from protein-energy malnutrition, which can manifest as marasmus or kwashiorkor. Kwashiorkor was once attributed to pure protein deficiency in individuals who were consuming enough calories (\"sugar baby syndrome\"). However, this theory has been challenged by the finding that there is no difference in the diets of children developing marasmus as opposed to kwashiorkor.[26] Still, for instance in Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) maintained by the USDA, lack of one or more of the essential amino acids is described as protein-energy malnutrition.[2]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Biological Value (BV)\n* Essential fatty acid\n* Essential genes\n* List of standard amino acids\n* Low-protein diet\n* Orthomolecular medicine\n* Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score\n* Ketogenic amino acid\n* Glucogenic amino acid\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Young VR (1994). \"Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations\". *J.
