Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/​general release/​second-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained.

However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTraditionally, war films, musicals, and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers of the 21st century. There is strong interest in the superhero genre, with ten films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men – Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat figure seems far more feasible, as reports of earnings in the Griffith collection list gross receipts for 1915–1919 at slightly more than $5.2 million (including foreign distribution) and total earnings after deducting general office expenses, but not royalties, at about $2 million.\n66. **^** \"Biggest Money Pictures\". *Variety*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | *Avengers* | $7,767,486,137\n | 4\n | $1,941,871,534\n | *Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| 1\n | *Endgame* (2019) | $2,797,501,328 |\n| 2\n | *Infinity War* (2018) | $2,048,359,754 |\n| 3\n | *The Avengers* (2012) | $1,518,815,515 |\n| 4\n | *Age of Ultron* (2015) | $1,402,809,540\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* | $7,333,501,460\n | 11\n | $666,681,951\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* | $25,000,134\\*($6,800,000–8,000,000)\\*R | $4,500,000–9,000,000 | [# 191][# 192][# 154][# 193] |\n| 1955 | *Lady and the Tramp* | $187,000,000 ($6,500,000)\\*R | $4,000,000 | [# 194][# 154][# 195] |\n| *Cinerama Holiday* | $21,000,000CI | $2,000,000 | [# 196][# 197] |\n| *Mister Roberts* | $9,900,000R | $2,400,000 | [# 198] |\n| 1956 | *The Ten Commandments* | $90,066,230R($122,700,000/$55,200,000R)\n | $13,270,000 | [# 97][# 199][# 200] |\n| 1957 | *The Bridge on the River Kwai* | $30,600,000R | $2,840,000 | [# 200] |\n| 1958 | *South Pacific* | $30,000,000R | $5,610,000 | [# 201] |\n| 1959 | *Ben-Hur* | $90,000,000R($146,900,000/$66,100,000R)\n | $15,900,000 | [# 202][# 203] |\n| 1960 | *Swiss Family Robinson* | $30,000,000R | $4,000,000 | [# 204] |\n| *Spartacus* | $60,000,000 ($22,105,225)R | $10,284,014 | [# 205][# 206] |\n| *Psycho* | $50,000,000+ ($14,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 207] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | The Fast Saga | $6,572,768,534\n | 10\n | $657,276,853\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| 1\n | *Furious 7* (2015) | $1,515,341,399 |\n| 2\n | *The Fate of the Furious* (2017)*F8* | $1,238,764,765 |\n| 3\n | *Fast & Furious 6* (2013) | $788,680,968 |\n| 4\n | *F9* (2021) | $726,229,501 |\n| 5\n | *Fast X* (2023) | $714,414,576 |\n| 6\n | *Fast Five* (2011) | $626,137,675 |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* (2009) | $360,366,870 |\n| 8\n | *2 Fast 2 Furious* (2003) | $236,350,661 |\n| 9\n | *The Fast and the Furious* (2001) | $207,517,509 |\n| 10\n | *Tokyo Drift* (2006) | $158,964,610\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Hobbs & Shaw* (2019) | $760,732,926\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 8\n | *Batman* | $6,843,842,452\n | 17\n | $402,578,968\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* ($1,081,169,825)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A portrait of a bespectacled middle aged man.](image)Films directed by Steven Spielberg have been the highest-grossing film of the year on six occasions, and on three occasions have been the highest-grossing film of all time.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** Tartaglione, Nancy (March 13, 2021). \"'Avatar' Overtakes 'Avengers: Endgame' As All-Time Highest-Grossing Film At Global Box Office; China Reissue Growing\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

If it were the rental gross then that would have made it not only the highest-grossing film of the year, but one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era, and if that is the case it would be unusual for both *International Motion Picture Almanac* and *Variety* to omit it from their lists.\n\n\nSSIt is not clear if the figure for *Sunny Side Up* is for North America or worldwide.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50 million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5 million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120 million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Cleopatra*: \"Domestic Rentals: $0.5; Production Cost: $0.3 (Unadjusted $s in Millions of $s).\"\n88. **^** Birchard, Robert S.

The 1970s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films, with six such films made by either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg topping the chart during the 1980s. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1980 | *The Empire Strikes Back* | $547,969,004 ($413,562,607)SW | $23,000,000–32,000,000 | [# 265][# 266] |\n| 1981 | *Raiders of the Lost Ark* | $389,925,971  ($321,866,000–353,988,025)\n | $18,000,000–22,800,000 | [# 267] |\n| 1982 | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $797,103,542  ($619,000,000–664,000,000)\n | $10,500,000–12,200,000 | [# 268][# 269][# 257][# 270][# 271] |\n| 1983 | *Return of the Jedi* | $482,366,101 ($385,845,197)SW | $32,500,000–42,700,000 | [# 272][# 266] |\n| 1984 | *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom* | $333,107,271 | $27,000,000–28,200,000 | [# 273][# 274][# 275] |\n| 1985 | *Back to the Future* | $389,225,789 ($381,109,762)\n | $19,000,000–22,000,000 | [# 276][# 277] |\n| 1986 | *Top Gun* | $357,288,178 ($345,000,000)\n | $14,000,000–19,000,000 | [# 278][# 279][# 274] |\n| 1987 | *Fatal Attraction* | $320,145,693 | $14,000,000 | [# 280][# 274] |\n| 1988 | *Rain Man* | $354,825,435 | $30,000,000 | [# 281][# 282] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *The Dark Knight *trilogy** | $2,462,179,755\n | 3\n | $820,726,585\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* ($1,081,169,825)\n |\n| 1\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012) | $1,081,169,825 |\n| 2\n | *The Dark Knight* (2008) | $1,007,336,937 |\n| 3\n | *Batman Begins* (2005) | $373,672,993\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Burton/Schumacher series | $1,253,192,682\n | 4\n | $313,298,171\n | *Batman* ($411,556,825)\n |\n| 1\n | *Batman* (1989) | $411,556,825 |\n| 2\n | *Batman Forever* (1995) | $336,567,531 |\n| 3\n | *Batman Returns* (1992) | $266,832,411 |\n| 4\n | *Batman & Robin* (1997) | $238,235,915\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Joker* (2019) | $1,074,458,282\n |  |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* (2016) | $873,637,528\n |  |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *The Batman* (2022) | $772,245,583\n |  |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBox office\n |\n| --- |\n| Topics | * Box office territory\n* Box-office bomb\n\t+ list\n* Fastest-grossing films\n* Second weekend box office\n\t+ highest-grossing second weekends\n* Sequels\n* Lists of box office number-one films\n\t+ most weekends at number one in North America\n* Four-wall distribution\n |\n| Highest-grossing | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Daniel Craig series | $3,969,513,462\n | 5\n | $793,902,692\n | *Skyfall* ($1,108,569,499)\n |\n| 1\n | *Skyfall* (2012) | $1,108,569,499 |\n| 2\n | *Spectre* (2015) | $880,705,312 |\n| 3\n | *No Time to Die* (2021) | $774,153,007 |\n| 4\n | *Casino Royale* (2006) | $616,505,162 |\n| 5\n | *Quantum of Solace* (2008) | $589,580,482\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Pierce Brosnan series | $1,479,008,618\n | 4\n | $369,752,155\n | *Die Another Day* ($431,971,116)\n |\n| 1\n | *Die Another Day* (2002) | $431,971,116 |\n| 2\n | *The World Is Not Enough* (1999) | $361,832,400 |\n| 3\n | *GoldenEye* (1995) | $352,194,034 |\n| 4\n | *Tomorrow Never Dies* (1997) | $333,011,068\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 9\n | DC Extended Universe*S †* | $6,754,514,016\n | 14\n | $482,465,287\n | *Aquaman* ($1,148,528,393)\n |\n| 1\n | *Aquaman* (2018) | $1,148,528,393 |\n| 2\n | *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* (2016) | $873,637,528 |\n| 3\n | *Wonder Woman* (2017) | $822,854,286 |\n| 4\n | *Suicide Squad* (2016) | $746,846,894 |\n| 5\n | *Man of Steel* (2013) | $668,045,518 |\n| 6\n | *Justice League* (2017) | $657,926,987 |\n| 7\n | *Black Adam* (2022) | $393,252,111 |\n| 8\n | *Shazam!* (2019) | $365,971,656 |\n| 9\n | *The Flash* (2023) | $270,633,313 |\n| 10\n | *Birds of Prey* (2020) | $205,372,791 |\n| 11\n | *Wonder Woman 1984* (2020) | $169,601,036 |\n| 12\n | *The Suicide Squad* (2021) | $168,717,425 |\n| 13\n | *Shazam!

Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Frozen (2013) – International Box Office Results: Germany\". *Box Office Mojo*.

With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war-themed films dominate again during this period, starting with *Gone with the Wind* (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with *The Best Years of Our Lives* (World War II) in 1946. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* 2018 re-release: \"2001: A Space Odyssey (2018 re-release)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time.

However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTraditionally, war films, musicals, and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers of the 21st century. There is strong interest in the superhero genre, with ten films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men – Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat figure seems far more feasible, as reports of earnings in the Griffith collection list gross receipts for 1915–1919 at slightly more than $5.2 million (including foreign distribution) and total earnings after deducting general office expenses, but not royalties, at about $2 million.\n66. **^** \"Biggest Money Pictures\". *Variety*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1961 | *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* | $303,000,000 | $3,600,000–4,000,000 | [# 194][# 208][# 146] |\n| *West Side Story* | $105,000,000 ($31,800,000)R | $7,000,000 | [# 209][# 210] |\n| 1962 | *Lawrence of Arabia* | $77,324,852 ($69,995,385)\n | $13,800,000 | [# 211][# 212] |\n| *How the West Was Won* | $35,000,000R | $14,483,000 | [# 213] |\n| *The Longest Day* | $33,200,000R | $8,600,000 | [# 210][# 212] |\n| 1963 | *Cleopatra* | $40,300,000R | $31,115,000 | [# 210][# 212] |\n| *From Russia with Love* | $78,900,000/$29,400,000R($12,500,000)R | $2,000,000 | [# 214][# 215][# 216] |\n| 1964 | *My Fair Lady* | $55,000,000R | $17,000,000 | [# 217] |\n| *Goldfinger* | $124,900,000 ($46,000,000)R | $3,000,000 | [# 214][# 216] |\n| *Mary Poppins* | $44,000,000–$50,000,000R | $5,200,000 | [# 218][# 217] |\n| 1965 | *The Sound of Music* | $286,214,076 ($114,600,000)R | $8,000,000 | [# 219][# 210] |\n| 1966 | *The Bible: In the Beginning* | $25,325,000R | $18,000,000 | [# 206][# 220] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1972 | *The Godfather* | $246,120,974–287,000,000  ($127,600,000–142,000,000)R | $6,000,000–7,200,000 | [# 237][# 236][# 238][# 239] |\n| 1973 | *The Exorcist* | $441,422,808 ($112,300,000)R | $10,000,000 | [# 240][# 241][# 242][# 243] |\n| *The Sting* | $115,000,000R | $5,500,000 | [# 244][# 245] |\n| 1974 | *The Towering Inferno* | $203,336,412 ($104,838,000)R | $14,300,000 | [# 246][# 247][# 248][# 243][# 249] |\n| 1975 | *Jaws* | $476,512,065 ($193,700,000)R | $9,000,000 | [# 250][# 251][# 252] |\n| 1976 | *Rocky* | $225,000,000 ($77,100,000)R | $1,075,000 | [# 253][# 254][# 236][# 255] |\n| 1977 | *Star Wars* | $775,398,007  ($530,000,000SW/$268,500,000R)\n | $11,293,151 | [# 256][# 257][# 236][# 258] |\n| 1978 | *Grease* | $396,271,103 ($341,000,000)\n | $6,000,000 | [# 259][# 260][# 226] |\n| 1979 | *Moonraker* | $210,308,099 | $31,000,000 | [# 261][# 214][# 262] |\n| *Rocky II* | $200,182,160 | $7,000,000 | [# 263][# 264][# 262] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGS*Variety* put the worldwide rental for *The Greatest Show on Earth* at around $18.35 million (with $12.8 million coming from the United States[53]) a year after its release; however, Birchard puts its earnings at just over $15 million up to 1962.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | *Avengers* | $7,767,486,137\n | 4\n | $1,941,871,534\n | *Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| 1\n | *Endgame* (2019) | $2,797,501,328 |\n| 2\n | *Infinity War* (2018) | $2,048,359,754 |\n| 3\n | *The Avengers* (2012) | $1,518,815,515 |\n| 4\n | *Age of Ultron* (2015) | $1,402,809,540\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* | $7,333,501,460\n | 11\n | $666,681,951\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* | $25,000,134\\*($6,800,000–8,000,000)\\*R | $4,500,000–9,000,000 | [# 191][# 192][# 154][# 193] |\n| 1955 | *Lady and the Tramp* | $187,000,000 ($6,500,000)\\*R | $4,000,000 | [# 194][# 154][# 195] |\n| *Cinerama Holiday* | $21,000,000CI | $2,000,000 | [# 196][# 197] |\n| *Mister Roberts* | $9,900,000R | $2,400,000 | [# 198] |\n| 1956 | *The Ten Commandments* | $90,066,230R($122,700,000/$55,200,000R)\n | $13,270,000 | [# 97][# 199][# 200] |\n| 1957 | *The Bridge on the River Kwai* | $30,600,000R | $2,840,000 | [# 200] |\n| 1958 | *South Pacific* | $30,000,000R | $5,610,000 | [# 201] |\n| 1959 | *Ben-Hur* | $90,000,000R($146,900,000/$66,100,000R)\n | $15,900,000 | [# 202][# 203] |\n| 1960 | *Swiss Family Robinson* | $30,000,000R | $4,000,000 | [# 204] |\n| *Spartacus* | $60,000,000 ($22,105,225)R | $10,284,014 | [# 205][# 206] |\n| *Psycho* | $50,000,000+ ($14,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 207] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | The Fast Saga | $6,572,768,534\n | 10\n | $657,276,853\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| 1\n | *Furious 7* (2015) | $1,515,341,399 |\n| 2\n | *The Fate of the Furious* (2017)*F8* | $1,238,764,765 |\n| 3\n | *Fast & Furious 6* (2013) | $788,680,968 |\n| 4\n | *F9* (2021) | $726,229,501 |\n| 5\n | *Fast X* (2023) | $714,414,576 |\n| 6\n | *Fast Five* (2011) | $626,137,675 |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* (2009) | $360,366,870 |\n| 8\n | *2 Fast 2 Furious* (2003) | $236,350,661 |\n| 9\n | *The Fast and the Furious* (2001) | $207,517,509 |\n| 10\n | *Tokyo Drift* (2006) | $158,964,610\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Hobbs & Shaw* (2019) | $760,732,926\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 8\n | *Batman* | $6,843,842,452\n | 17\n | $402,578,968\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* ($1,081,169,825)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A portrait of a bespectacled middle aged man.](image)Films directed by Steven Spielberg have been the highest-grossing film of the year on six occasions, and on three occasions have been the highest-grossing film of all time.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** Tartaglione, Nancy (March 13, 2021). \"'Avatar' Overtakes 'Avengers: Endgame' As All-Time Highest-Grossing Film At Global Box Office; China Reissue Growing\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

The total for *Avatar*'s first appearance on the chart includes revenue from the 2010 Special Edition, which represents all of its earnings up to the point it relinquished the record, whereas its second appearance also incorporates revenue from a 2020 re-release in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the 2021 re-release in China which helped it to reclaim the record. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. ^ ***a*** ***b*** *Guinness World Records*.

Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. *Titanic* earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theatres. While complete sales data are not available for *Avatar*, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion each. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** \"Top Gun: Maverick (2022)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

If it were the rental gross then that would have made it not only the highest-grossing film of the year, but one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era, and if that is the case it would be unusual for both *International Motion Picture Almanac* and *Variety* to omit it from their lists.\n\n\nSSIt is not clear if the figure for *Sunny Side Up* is for North America or worldwide.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50 million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5 million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120 million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Cleopatra*: \"Domestic Rentals: $0.5; Production Cost: $0.3 (Unadjusted $s in Millions of $s).\"\n88. **^** Birchard, Robert S.

Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Frozen (2013) – International Box Office Results: Germany\". *Box Office Mojo*.

During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with *The Birth of a Nation* (American Civil War), *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse*, *The Big Parade* and *Wings* (all World War I) becoming the most successful films in their respective years of release, with the trend coming to an end with *All Quiet on the Western Front* in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war-themed films dominate again during this period, starting with *Gone with the Wind* (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with *The Best Years of Our Lives* (World War II) in 1946. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* 2018 re-release: \"2001: A Space Odyssey (2018 re-release)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/​general release/​second-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained.

However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTraditionally, war films, musicals, and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers of the 21st century. There is strong interest in the superhero genre, with ten films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men – Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat figure seems far more feasible, as reports of earnings in the Griffith collection list gross receipts for 1915–1919 at slightly more than $5.2 million (including foreign distribution) and total earnings after deducting general office expenses, but not royalties, at about $2 million.\n66. **^** \"Biggest Money Pictures\". *Variety*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1961 | *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* | $303,000,000 | $3,600,000–4,000,000 | [# 194][# 208][# 146] |\n| *West Side Story* | $105,000,000 ($31,800,000)R | $7,000,000 | [# 209][# 210] |\n| 1962 | *Lawrence of Arabia* | $77,324,852 ($69,995,385)\n | $13,800,000 | [# 211][# 212] |\n| *How the West Was Won* | $35,000,000R | $14,483,000 | [# 213] |\n| *The Longest Day* | $33,200,000R | $8,600,000 | [# 210][# 212] |\n| 1963 | *Cleopatra* | $40,300,000R | $31,115,000 | [# 210][# 212] |\n| *From Russia with Love* | $78,900,000/$29,400,000R($12,500,000)R | $2,000,000 | [# 214][# 215][# 216] |\n| 1964 | *My Fair Lady* | $55,000,000R | $17,000,000 | [# 217] |\n| *Goldfinger* | $124,900,000 ($46,000,000)R | $3,000,000 | [# 214][# 216] |\n| *Mary Poppins* | $44,000,000–$50,000,000R | $5,200,000 | [# 218][# 217] |\n| 1965 | *The Sound of Music* | $286,214,076 ($114,600,000)R | $8,000,000 | [# 219][# 210] |\n| 1966 | *The Bible: In the Beginning* | $25,325,000R | $18,000,000 | [# 206][# 220] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1972 | *The Godfather* | $246,120,974–287,000,000  ($127,600,000–142,000,000)R | $6,000,000–7,200,000 | [# 237][# 236][# 238][# 239] |\n| 1973 | *The Exorcist* | $441,422,808 ($112,300,000)R | $10,000,000 | [# 240][# 241][# 242][# 243] |\n| *The Sting* | $115,000,000R | $5,500,000 | [# 244][# 245] |\n| 1974 | *The Towering Inferno* | $203,336,412 ($104,838,000)R | $14,300,000 | [# 246][# 247][# 248][# 243][# 249] |\n| 1975 | *Jaws* | $476,512,065 ($193,700,000)R | $9,000,000 | [# 250][# 251][# 252] |\n| 1976 | *Rocky* | $225,000,000 ($77,100,000)R | $1,075,000 | [# 253][# 254][# 236][# 255] |\n| 1977 | *Star Wars* | $775,398,007  ($530,000,000SW/$268,500,000R)\n | $11,293,151 | [# 256][# 257][# 236][# 258] |\n| 1978 | *Grease* | $396,271,103 ($341,000,000)\n | $6,000,000 | [# 259][# 260][# 226] |\n| 1979 | *Moonraker* | $210,308,099 | $31,000,000 | [# 261][# 214][# 262] |\n| *Rocky II* | $200,182,160 | $7,000,000 | [# 263][# 264][# 262] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGS*Variety* put the worldwide rental for *The Greatest Show on Earth* at around $18.35 million (with $12.8 million coming from the United States[53]) a year after its release; however, Birchard puts its earnings at just over $15 million up to 1962.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | *Avengers* | $7,767,486,137\n | 4\n | $1,941,871,534\n | *Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| 1\n | *Endgame* (2019) | $2,797,501,328 |\n| 2\n | *Infinity War* (2018) | $2,048,359,754 |\n| 3\n | *The Avengers* (2012) | $1,518,815,515 |\n| 4\n | *Age of Ultron* (2015) | $1,402,809,540\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* | $7,333,501,460\n | 11\n | $666,681,951\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* | $25,000,134\\*($6,800,000–8,000,000)\\*R | $4,500,000–9,000,000 | [# 191][# 192][# 154][# 193] |\n| 1955 | *Lady and the Tramp* | $187,000,000 ($6,500,000)\\*R | $4,000,000 | [# 194][# 154][# 195] |\n| *Cinerama Holiday* | $21,000,000CI | $2,000,000 | [# 196][# 197] |\n| *Mister Roberts* | $9,900,000R | $2,400,000 | [# 198] |\n| 1956 | *The Ten Commandments* | $90,066,230R($122,700,000/$55,200,000R)\n | $13,270,000 | [# 97][# 199][# 200] |\n| 1957 | *The Bridge on the River Kwai* | $30,600,000R | $2,840,000 | [# 200] |\n| 1958 | *South Pacific* | $30,000,000R | $5,610,000 | [# 201] |\n| 1959 | *Ben-Hur* | $90,000,000R($146,900,000/$66,100,000R)\n | $15,900,000 | [# 202][# 203] |\n| 1960 | *Swiss Family Robinson* | $30,000,000R | $4,000,000 | [# 204] |\n| *Spartacus* | $60,000,000 ($22,105,225)R | $10,284,014 | [# 205][# 206] |\n| *Psycho* | $50,000,000+ ($14,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 207] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | The Fast Saga | $6,572,768,534\n | 10\n | $657,276,853\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| 1\n | *Furious 7* (2015) | $1,515,341,399 |\n| 2\n | *The Fate of the Furious* (2017)*F8* | $1,238,764,765 |\n| 3\n | *Fast & Furious 6* (2013) | $788,680,968 |\n| 4\n | *F9* (2021) | $726,229,501 |\n| 5\n | *Fast X* (2023) | $714,414,576 |\n| 6\n | *Fast Five* (2011) | $626,137,675 |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* (2009) | $360,366,870 |\n| 8\n | *2 Fast 2 Furious* (2003) | $236,350,661 |\n| 9\n | *The Fast and the Furious* (2001) | $207,517,509 |\n| 10\n | *Tokyo Drift* (2006) | $158,964,610\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Hobbs & Shaw* (2019) | $760,732,926\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 8\n | *Batman* | $6,843,842,452\n | 17\n | $402,578,968\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* ($1,081,169,825)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A portrait of a bespectacled middle aged man.](image)Films directed by Steven Spielberg have been the highest-grossing film of the year on six occasions, and on three occasions have been the highest-grossing film of all time.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** Tartaglione, Nancy (March 13, 2021). \"'Avatar' Overtakes 'Avengers: Endgame' As All-Time Highest-Grossing Film At Global Box Office; China Reissue Growing\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

If it were the rental gross then that would have made it not only the highest-grossing film of the year, but one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era, and if that is the case it would be unusual for both *International Motion Picture Almanac* and *Variety* to omit it from their lists.\n\n\nSSIt is not clear if the figure for *Sunny Side Up* is for North America or worldwide.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50 million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5 million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120 million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Cleopatra*: \"Domestic Rentals: $0.5; Production Cost: $0.3 (Unadjusted $s in Millions of $s).\"\n88. **^** Birchard, Robert S.

Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Frozen (2013) – International Box Office Results: Germany\". *Box Office Mojo*.

With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war-themed films dominate again during this period, starting with *Gone with the Wind* (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with *The Best Years of Our Lives* (World War II) in 1946. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* 2018 re-release: \"2001: A Space Odyssey (2018 re-release)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time.

However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTraditionally, war films, musicals, and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers of the 21st century. There is strong interest in the superhero genre, with ten films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men – Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat figure seems far more feasible, as reports of earnings in the Griffith collection list gross receipts for 1915–1919 at slightly more than $5.2 million (including foreign distribution) and total earnings after deducting general office expenses, but not royalties, at about $2 million.\n66. **^** \"Biggest Money Pictures\". *Variety*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1961 | *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* | $303,000,000 | $3,600,000–4,000,000 | [# 194][# 208][# 146] |\n| *West Side Story* | $105,000,000 ($31,800,000)R | $7,000,000 | [# 209][# 210] |\n| 1962 | *Lawrence of Arabia* | $77,324,852 ($69,995,385)\n | $13,800,000 | [# 211][# 212] |\n| *How the West Was Won* | $35,000,000R | $14,483,000 | [# 213] |\n| *The Longest Day* | $33,200,000R | $8,600,000 | [# 210][# 212] |\n| 1963 | *Cleopatra* | $40,300,000R | $31,115,000 | [# 210][# 212] |\n| *From Russia with Love* | $78,900,000/$29,400,000R($12,500,000)R | $2,000,000 | [# 214][# 215][# 216] |\n| 1964 | *My Fair Lady* | $55,000,000R | $17,000,000 | [# 217] |\n| *Goldfinger* | $124,900,000 ($46,000,000)R | $3,000,000 | [# 214][# 216] |\n| *Mary Poppins* | $44,000,000–$50,000,000R | $5,200,000 | [# 218][# 217] |\n| 1965 | *The Sound of Music* | $286,214,076 ($114,600,000)R | $8,000,000 | [# 219][# 210] |\n| 1966 | *The Bible: In the Beginning* | $25,325,000R | $18,000,000 | [# 206][# 220] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1972 | *The Godfather* | $246,120,974–287,000,000  ($127,600,000–142,000,000)R | $6,000,000–7,200,000 | [# 237][# 236][# 238][# 239] |\n| 1973 | *The Exorcist* | $441,422,808 ($112,300,000)R | $10,000,000 | [# 240][# 241][# 242][# 243] |\n| *The Sting* | $115,000,000R | $5,500,000 | [# 244][# 245] |\n| 1974 | *The Towering Inferno* | $203,336,412 ($104,838,000)R | $14,300,000 | [# 246][# 247][# 248][# 243][# 249] |\n| 1975 | *Jaws* | $476,512,065 ($193,700,000)R | $9,000,000 | [# 250][# 251][# 252] |\n| 1976 | *Rocky* | $225,000,000 ($77,100,000)R | $1,075,000 | [# 253][# 254][# 236][# 255] |\n| 1977 | *Star Wars* | $775,398,007  ($530,000,000SW/$268,500,000R)\n | $11,293,151 | [# 256][# 257][# 236][# 258] |\n| 1978 | *Grease* | $396,271,103 ($341,000,000)\n | $6,000,000 | [# 259][# 260][# 226] |\n| 1979 | *Moonraker* | $210,308,099 | $31,000,000 | [# 261][# 214][# 262] |\n| *Rocky II* | $200,182,160 | $7,000,000 | [# 263][# 264][# 262] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGS*Variety* put the worldwide rental for *The Greatest Show on Earth* at around $18.35 million (with $12.8 million coming from the United States[53]) a year after its release; however, Birchard puts its earnings at just over $15 million up to 1962.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | *Avengers* | $7,767,486,137\n | 4\n | $1,941,871,534\n | *Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| 1\n | *Endgame* (2019) | $2,797,501,328 |\n| 2\n | *Infinity War* (2018) | $2,048,359,754 |\n| 3\n | *The Avengers* (2012) | $1,518,815,515 |\n| 4\n | *Age of Ultron* (2015) | $1,402,809,540\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* | $7,333,501,460\n | 11\n | $666,681,951\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* | $25,000,134\\*($6,800,000–8,000,000)\\*R | $4,500,000–9,000,000 | [# 191][# 192][# 154][# 193] |\n| 1955 | *Lady and the Tramp* | $187,000,000 ($6,500,000)\\*R | $4,000,000 | [# 194][# 154][# 195] |\n| *Cinerama Holiday* | $21,000,000CI | $2,000,000 | [# 196][# 197] |\n| *Mister Roberts* | $9,900,000R | $2,400,000 | [# 198] |\n| 1956 | *The Ten Commandments* | $90,066,230R($122,700,000/$55,200,000R)\n | $13,270,000 | [# 97][# 199][# 200] |\n| 1957 | *The Bridge on the River Kwai* | $30,600,000R | $2,840,000 | [# 200] |\n| 1958 | *South Pacific* | $30,000,000R | $5,610,000 | [# 201] |\n| 1959 | *Ben-Hur* | $90,000,000R($146,900,000/$66,100,000R)\n | $15,900,000 | [# 202][# 203] |\n| 1960 | *Swiss Family Robinson* | $30,000,000R | $4,000,000 | [# 204] |\n| *Spartacus* | $60,000,000 ($22,105,225)R | $10,284,014 | [# 205][# 206] |\n| *Psycho* | $50,000,000+ ($14,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 207] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | The Fast Saga | $6,572,768,534\n | 10\n | $657,276,853\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| 1\n | *Furious 7* (2015) | $1,515,341,399 |\n| 2\n | *The Fate of the Furious* (2017)*F8* | $1,238,764,765 |\n| 3\n | *Fast & Furious 6* (2013) | $788,680,968 |\n| 4\n | *F9* (2021) | $726,229,501 |\n| 5\n | *Fast X* (2023) | $714,414,576 |\n| 6\n | *Fast Five* (2011) | $626,137,675 |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* (2009) | $360,366,870 |\n| 8\n | *2 Fast 2 Furious* (2003) | $236,350,661 |\n| 9\n | *The Fast and the Furious* (2001) | $207,517,509 |\n| 10\n | *Tokyo Drift* (2006) | $158,964,610\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Hobbs & Shaw* (2019) | $760,732,926\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 8\n | *Batman* | $6,843,842,452\n | 17\n | $402,578,968\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* ($1,081,169,825)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A portrait of a bespectacled middle aged man.](image)Films directed by Steven Spielberg have been the highest-grossing film of the year on six occasions, and on three occasions have been the highest-grossing film of all time.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** Tartaglione, Nancy (March 13, 2021). \"'Avatar' Overtakes 'Avengers: Endgame' As All-Time Highest-Grossing Film At Global Box Office; China Reissue Growing\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

The total for *Avatar*'s first appearance on the chart includes revenue from the 2010 Special Edition, which represents all of its earnings up to the point it relinquished the record, whereas its second appearance also incorporates revenue from a 2020 re-release in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the 2021 re-release in China which helped it to reclaim the record. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. ^ ***a*** ***b*** *Guinness World Records*.

Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. *Titanic* earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theatres. While complete sales data are not available for *Avatar*, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion each. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** \"Top Gun: Maverick (2022)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

If it were the rental gross then that would have made it not only the highest-grossing film of the year, but one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era, and if that is the case it would be unusual for both *International Motion Picture Almanac* and *Variety* to omit it from their lists.\n\n\nSSIt is not clear if the figure for *Sunny Side Up* is for North America or worldwide.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50 million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5 million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120 million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Cleopatra*: \"Domestic Rentals: $0.5; Production Cost: $0.3 (Unadjusted $s in Millions of $s).\"\n88. **^** Birchard, Robert S.

Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Frozen (2013) – International Box Office Results: Germany\". *Box Office Mojo*.

During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with *The Birth of a Nation* (American Civil War), *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse*, *The Big Parade* and *Wings* (all World War I) becoming the most successful films in their respective years of release, with the trend coming to an end with *All Quiet on the Western Front* in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war-themed films dominate again during this period, starting with *Gone with the Wind* (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with *The Best Years of Our Lives* (World War II) in 1946. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* 2018 re-release: \"2001: A Space Odyssey (2018 re-release)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[297]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Avatar* premiered on December 10, 2009, in London and was released in the United States on December 18, 2009, to positive reviews. Critics highly praised its groundbreaking visual effects, though the story was considered to be predictable.[21][22][23] During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. In July 2019, this position was overtaken by *Avengers: Endgame*, but with subsequent re-releases, beginning with China in March 2021, it returned to becoming the highest-grossing film since then.[24] Adjusted for inflation, *Avatar* is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time, only behind *Gone with the Wind*, with a total of a little more than $3.5 billion. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion[25] and the best-selling video title of 2010 in the United States. *Avatar* was nominated for nine awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, winning three, and received numerous other accolades. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *The Exorcist* (1973)\n* *Chinatown* (1974)\n* *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* (1975)\n |\n| 1976–2000 | * *Rocky* (1976)\n* *The Turning Point* (1977)\n* *Midnight Express* (1978)\n* *Kramer vs. Kramer* (1979)\n* *Ordinary People* (1980)\n* *On Golden Pond* (1981)\n* *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982)\n* *Terms of Endearment* (1983)\n* *Amadeus* (1984)\n* *Out of Africa* (1985)\n* *Platoon* (1986)\n* *The Last Emperor* (1987)\n* *Rain Man* (1988)\n* *Born on the Fourth of July* (1989)\n* *Dances with Wolves* (1990)\n* *Bugsy* (1991)\n* *Scent of a Woman* (1992)\n* *Schindler's List* (1993)\n* *Forrest Gump* (1994)\n* *Sense and Sensibility* (1995)\n* *The English Patient* (1996)\n* *Titanic* (1997)\n* *Saving Private Ryan* (1998)\n* *American Beauty* (1999)\n* *Gladiator* (2000)\n |\n| 2001–present | * *A Beautiful Mind* (2001)\n* *The Hours* (2002)\n* *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003)\n* *The Aviator* (2004)\n* *Brokeback Mountain* (2005)\n* *Babel* (2006)\n* *Atonement* (2007)\n* *Slumdog Millionaire* (2008)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n293. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"'Avatar' Hits $1 Billion Mark, Eyes 'Titanic' Record\". *omg!*.

He stated in an interview, \"*Avatar* has been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken.\"[99] Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one.

Gray said, \"At this point, people who are going to see *Avatar* are going to see *Avatar* and would even if the slate was strong.\"[299] Marketing the film as a \"novelty factor\" also helped.

The international IMAX release included 58 theaters beginning on December 16, and 25 more theaters were to be added in the coming weeks.[163] The IMAX release was the company's widest to date, a total of 261 theaters worldwide. The previous IMAX record opening was *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, which opened in 161 IMAX theaters in the US, and about 70 international.[164] 20th Century Fox Korea adapted and later released *Avatar* in 4D version, which included \"moving seats, smells of explosives, sprinkling water, laser lights and wind\".[20]\n\n\n\n#### Post-original release[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn July 2010, Cameron confirmed that there would be an extended theatrical rerelease of the film on August 27, 2010, exclusively in 3D theaters and IMAX 3D.[165] *Avatar: Special Edition* includes an additional nine minutes of footage, all of which is CG,[166] including an extension of the sex scene[167] and various other scenes that were cut from the original theatrical film.[166] This extended re-release resulted in the film's run time approaching the then-current IMAX platter maximum of 170 minutes, thereby leaving less time for the end credits. Cameron stated that the nine minutes of added scenes cost more than $1 million a minute to produce and finish.[168] During its 12-week re-release, *Avatar: Special Edition* grossed an additional $10.74 million in North America and $22.46 million overseas for a worldwide total of $33.2 million.[5] The film was later re-released in China in March 2021, allowing it to surpass *Avengers: Endgame* to become the highest-grossing film of all time.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSaturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film\n |\n| --- |\n| 1970s | * *Slaughterhouse-Five* (1972)\n* *Soylent Green* (1973)\n* *Rollerball* (1974/75)\n* *Logan's Run* (1976)\n* *Star Wars* (1977)\n* *Superman* (1978)\n* *Alien* (1979)\n |\n| 1980s | * *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980)\n* *Superman II* (1981)\n* *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982)\n* *Return of the Jedi* (1983)\n* *The Terminator* (1984)\n* *Back to the Future* (1985)\n* *Aliens* (1986)\n* *RoboCop* (1987)\n* *Alien Nation* (1988)\n |\n| 1990s | * *Total Recall* (1989/90)\n* *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991)\n* *Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country* (1992)\n* *Jurassic Park* (1993)\n* *Stargate* (1994)\n* *12 Monkeys* (1995)\n* *Independence Day* (1996)\n* *Men in Black* (1997)\n* *Armageddon*/*Dark City* (1998)\n* *The Matrix* (1999)\n |\n| 2000s | * *X-Men* (2000)\n* *A.I.

Mendelson argued *Avatar*'s only achievement of note to be its popularization of 3D cinema. Despite this, he still felt it was a quality film, saying, \"A great blockbuster movie can just be a great blockbuster movie without capturing the lunchbox market.\"[308] He further reflected and reversed his stance in 2022 after the box office success of the re-release, saying, \"The very things that made *Avatar* sometimes feel like a 'forgotten blockbuster' have inspired a skewed renewed nostalgia for its singular existence. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n150. **^** \"Mattel is Master Toy Licensee for Cameron's Avatar\". *ComingSoon.net*.

He said, \"While *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[295] Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to \"try to topple *Titanic* off its perch\" because it \"just struck some kind of chord\" and there had been other good films in recent years.[296] He changed his prediction by mid-January. \"It's gonna happen.

Critics highly praised its groundbreaking visual effects, though the story was considered to be predictable.[21][22][23] During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. In July 2019, this position was overtaken by *Avengers: Endgame*, but with subsequent re-releases, beginning with China in March 2021, it returned to becoming the highest-grossing film since then.[24] Adjusted for inflation, *Avatar* is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time, only behind *Gone with the Wind*, with a total of a little more than $3.5 billion. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion[25] and the best-selling video title of 2010 in the United States. *Avatar* was nominated for nine awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, winning three, and received numerous other accolades. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *The Exorcist* (1973)\n* *Chinatown* (1974)\n* *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* (1975)\n |\n| 1976–2000 | * *Rocky* (1976)\n* *The Turning Point* (1977)\n* *Midnight Express* (1978)\n* *Kramer vs. Kramer* (1979)\n* *Ordinary People* (1980)\n* *On Golden Pond* (1981)\n* *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982)\n* *Terms of Endearment* (1983)\n* *Amadeus* (1984)\n* *Out of Africa* (1985)\n* *Platoon* (1986)\n* *The Last Emperor* (1987)\n* *Rain Man* (1988)\n* *Born on the Fourth of July* (1989)\n* *Dances with Wolves* (1990)\n* *Bugsy* (1991)\n* *Scent of a Woman* (1992)\n* *Schindler's List* (1993)\n* *Forrest Gump* (1994)\n* *Sense and Sensibility* (1995)\n* *The English Patient* (1996)\n* *Titanic* (1997)\n* *Saving Private Ryan* (1998)\n* *American Beauty* (1999)\n* *Gladiator* (2000)\n |\n| 2001–present | * *A Beautiful Mind* (2001)\n* *The Hours* (2002)\n* *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003)\n* *The Aviator* (2004)\n* *Brokeback Mountain* (2005)\n* *Babel* (2006)\n* *Atonement* (2007)\n* *Slumdog Millionaire* (2008)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n293. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"'Avatar' Hits $1 Billion Mark, Eyes 'Titanic' Record\". *omg!*.

The increased ticket price – an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets – helped the film.[299] Likewise, *Entertainment Weekly* attributed the film's success to 3D glasses but also to its \"astronomic word-of-mouth\". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but \"the buzz\" created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings.[300] Gray said *Avatar* having no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. \"The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes,\" he said, \"but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films: *Titanic* (historical events), the *Star Wars* movies (an established film franchise), or *The Lord of the Rings* (literature). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n90. **^** Masters, Tim (December 16, 2009). \"Will Avatar crown James Cameron 'King of the Universe'?\". *BBC News*.

He stated in an interview, \"*Avatar* has been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken.\"[99] Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one.

He said, \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\".[200] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* gave the film a compromising review, finding it to be overdeveloped and overwrought, stating, \"The one thing you do need to know about *Avengers: Endgame* is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax.

He found writing the music to end Captain America's story poignant, since he had \"been on this journey with him since the beginning\".[115] The film also uses the *Ant-Man* (2015) theme by Christophe Beck, the *Doctor Strange* (2016) theme by Michael Giacchino, and the *Captain Marvel* theme by Pinar Toprak.[116] Additionally, the songs \"Come and Get Your Love\" by Redbone and \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn are used, after previously being heard in *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014), respectively.[117][118]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLike domestically, the film ended up over-performing and debuted to $866 million overseas.

The filming location moved to Wellington on September 25, 2017, which ended in late September 2020 after three years of shooting.

The projector in the movie hall runs at 48 frames per second, for the 24 fps sections frames are duplicated.[110] To avoid the soap opera effect, Lightstorm Entertainment hired Pixelworks in 2020, which used their TrueCut Motion software to create \"motion grading\", a tool that ensure a movie keep its theatrical appearance.[111]\n\n\n\n#### Live-action[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the box-office success of *The Way of Water*, Cameron confirmed that the sequels are effectively greenlit. \"It looks like with the momentum that the film has now that we'll easily pass our break even in the next few days, so it looks like I can't wiggle out of this and I'm gonna have to do these other sequels,\" Cameron said in January 2023, adding: \"I know what I'm going to be doing the next six or seven years.\"[280] It was also confirmed that Brendan Cowell will reprise his role as Captain Mick Scoresby and will also feature the return of Payakan, the Tulkun who befriends Lo'ak.[281] Giovanni Ribisi will reprise his role as Parker Selfridge, with his character having a bigger role in the film after his brief cameo in *The Way of Water*.[282]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn July 2022, the New Zealand Film Commission disclosed that the *Avatar* sequels had received over NZ$140 million worth of public funding through the country's Screen Production Grant.

The projector in the movie hall runs at 48 frames per second, for the 24 fps sections frames are duplicated.[110] To avoid the soap opera effect, Lightstorm Entertainment hired Pixelworks in 2020, which used their TrueCut Motion software to create \"motion grading\", a tool that ensure a movie keep its theatrical appearance.[111]\n\n\n\n#### Live-action[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the box-office success of *The Way of Water*, Cameron confirmed that the sequels are effectively greenlit. \"It looks like with the momentum that the film has now that we'll easily pass our break even in the next few days, so it looks like I can't wiggle out of this and I'm gonna have to do these other sequels,\" Cameron said in January 2023, adding: \"I know what I'm going to be doing the next six or seven years.\"[280] It was also confirmed that Brendan Cowell will reprise his role as Captain Mick Scoresby and will also feature the return of Payakan, the Tulkun who befriends Lo'ak.[281] Giovanni Ribisi will reprise his role as Parker Selfridge, with his character having a bigger role in the film after his brief cameo in *The Way of Water*.[282]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn July 2022, the New Zealand Film Commission disclosed that the *Avatar* sequels had received over NZ$140 million worth of public funding through the country's Screen Production Grant.

While ACT party deputy leader Brooke van Velden criticised the Government's film subsidy programme for allegedly taking public funding from other areas, the Economic Development and Regional Development Minister Stuart Nash argued that New Zealand's film subsidies for major Hollywood products brought much needed overseas investment and jobs to the New Zealand film industry.[131]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. **^** Farley, Jordan (November 8, 2022). \"James Cameron discusses his scrapped Avatar 2 script\". *Total Film*.

For one, \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly ... *Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them\" and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than ever before.[144] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. \"Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[142] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, \"I don't think it's realistic to try to topple *Titanic* off its perch. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Titanic* was released on December 19, 1997.

With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, *Titanic* was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark.

For one, \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly ... *Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them\" and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than ever before.[144] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. \"Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[142] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, \"I don't think it's realistic to try to topple *Titanic* off its perch. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Titanic* was released on December 19, 1997. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly those of DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart), production values, direction, score, cinematography, story and emotional depth. Among other awards, it was nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won 11, including Best Picture and Best Director, tying *Ben-Hur* (1959) for the most Academy Awards won by a film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, *Titanic* was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's next film, *Avatar* (2009), surpassed it in 2010. A number of re-releases have pushed the film's worldwide total to $2.257 billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide after *Avatar*. In 2017, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Braveheart* (1995)\n* *The English Patient* (1996)\n* *Titanic* (1997)\n* *Shakespeare in Love* (1998)\n* *American Beauty* (1999)\n* *Gladiator* (2000)\n |\n| 2001–present | * *A Beautiful Mind* (2001)\n* *Chicago* (2002)\n* *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003)\n* *Million Dollar Baby* (2004)\n* *Crash* (2005)\n* *The Departed* (2006)\n* *No Country for Old Men* (2007)\n* *Slumdog Millionaire* (2008)\n* *The Hurt Locker* (2009)\n* *The King's Speech* (2010)\n* *The Artist* (2011)\n* *Argo* (2012)\n* *12 Years a Slave* (2013)\n* *Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)* (2014)\n* *Spotlight* (2015)\n* *Moonlight* (2016)\n* *The Shape of Water* (2017)\n* *Green Book* (2018)\n* *Parasite* (2019)\n* *Nomadland* (2020)\n* *CODA* (2021)\n* *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (2022)\n* *Oppenheimer* (2023)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *The Exorcist* (1973)\n* *Chinatown* (1974)\n* *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* (1975)\n |\n| 1976–2000 | * *Rocky* (1976)\n* *The Turning Point* (1977)\n* *Midnight Express* (1978)\n* *Kramer vs. Kramer* (1979)\n* *Ordinary People* (1980)\n* *On Golden Pond* (1981)\n* *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982)\n* *Terms of Endearment* (1983)\n* *Amadeus* (1984)\n* *Out of Africa* (1985)\n* *Platoon* (1986)\n* *The Last Emperor* (1987)\n* *Rain Man* (1988)\n* *Born on the Fourth of July* (1989)\n* *Dances with Wolves* (1990)\n* *Bugsy* (1991)\n* *Scent of a Woman* (1992)\n* *Schindler's List* (1993)\n* *Forrest Gump* (1994)\n* *Sense and Sensibility* (1995)\n* *The English Patient* (1996)\n* *Titanic* (1997)\n* *Saving Private Ryan* (1998)\n* *American Beauty* (1999)\n* *Gladiator* (2000)\n |\n| 2001–present | * *A Beautiful Mind* (2001)\n* *The Hours* (2002)\n* *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003)\n* *The Aviator* (2004)\n* *Brokeback Mountain* (2005)\n* *Babel* (2006)\n* *Atonement* (2007)\n* *Slumdog Millionaire* (2008)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nProducers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture\n |\n| --- |\n| * *Driving Miss Daisy* (1989)\n* *Dances with Wolves* (1990)\n* *The Silence of the Lambs* (1991)\n* *The Crying Game* (1992)\n* *Schindler's List* (1993)\n* *Forrest Gump* (1994)\n* *Apollo 13* (1995)\n* *The English Patient* (1996)\n* *Titanic* (1997)\n* *Saving Private Ryan* (1998)\n* *American Beauty* (1999)\n* *Gladiator* (2000)\n* *Moulin Rouge!* (2001)\n* *Chicago* (2002)\n* *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003)\n* *The Aviator* (2004)\n* *Brokeback Mountain* (2005)\n* *Little Miss Sunshine* (2006)\n* *No Country for Old Men* (2007)\n* *Slumdog Millionaire* (2008)\n* *The Hurt Locker* (2009)\n* *The King's Speech* (2010)\n* *The Artist* (2011)\n* *Argo* (2012)\n* *12 Years a Slave* / *Gravity* (2013)\n* *Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)* (2014)\n* *The Big Short* (2015)\n* *La La Land* (2016)\n* *The Shape of Water* (2017)\n* *Green Book* (2018)\n* *1917* (2019)\n* *Nomadland* (2020)\n* *CODA* (2021)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n143. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Jacks, Brian (January 16, 2010). \"EXCLUSIVE: James Cameron Says 'Avatar' Will Beat 'Titanic' To Become Biggest Of All Time\". *MTV*.

Abrams met Miranda at a performance of his Broadway musical *Hamilton*, where Miranda jokingly offered to compose cantina music, should it be needed. Unknown to Miranda, Williams had previously told Abrams that he did not want to compose the music for that scene, wanting to focus on the orchestral score. Abrams then contacted Miranda, and the two collaborated on the music for the scene over a period of two months.[204]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n262. **^** Ritman, Alex (December 15, 2015). \"'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Sets U.K. Pre-Sales Record With 'Way Beyond 1 Million' Tickets\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

IMAX has never previously registered more than $1 million in pre-sales on a single day.[258] In total, it sold over $50 million in pre-sales, breaking the record.[259][260] This number was raised to $100 million including $50–60 million in advance ticket sales by December 14.[260][261] However, not all tickets that were pre-sold were for the film's opening weekend, with Fandango President Paul Yanover saying \"people have set aside tickets for screenings in January, weeks after the big opening [...] We have people buying *Star Wars* [*The Force Awakens*] into 2016. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\n* *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* at StarWars.com\n* *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* at Lucasfilm.com\n* *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* *The Force Awakens* title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database\n* *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* at AllMovie ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\n*Star Wars* sequel trilogy\n |\n| --- |\n| Films | * *The Force Awakens* (2015)\n\t+ accolades\n\t+ box office records\n* *The Last Jedi* (2017)\n* *The Rise of Skywalker* (2019)\n\t+ *Duel of the Fates*\n |\n| Series | * *The Resistance Rises* (2016)\n* *Resistance* (2018–2020)\n |\n| Specials | * *The Holiday Special* (2020)\n* *Terrifying Tales* (2021)\n* *Summer Vacation* (2022)\n |\n| Characters | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** O'Connell, Sean (June 24, 2016). \"Did Ben Affleck Almost Direct A *Star Wars* Movie?

The film is the first *Star Wars* film to not extensively involve franchise creator George Lucas, who only served as a creative consultant in the early stages of production. *The Force Awakens* was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) and *Return of the Jedi*, rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the score. Principal photography began in April 2014 and concluded the following November. Filming took place on sets at Pinewood Studios in England, and on location mainly in Abu Dhabi, Iceland, and Ireland. On a budget of $447 million, it is the most expensive film ever made.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n115. **^** Butler, Tom (May 19, 2013). \"Star Trek Costume Designer Joins Star Wars VII Crew\". *IGN*.

The film is the first *Star Wars* film to not extensively involve franchise creator George Lucas, who only served as a creative consultant in the early stages of production. *The Force Awakens* was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) and *Return of the Jedi*, rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the score. Principal photography began in April 2014 and concluded the following November. Filming took place on sets at Pinewood Studios in England, and on location mainly in Abu Dhabi, Iceland, and Ireland. On a budget of $447 million, it is the most expensive film ever made.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n115. **^** Butler, Tom (May 19, 2013). \"Star Trek Costume Designer Joins Star Wars VII Crew\". *IGN*.
