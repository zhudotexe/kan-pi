with some pockets in neighbouring countries.\nUnlike their compatriots on the southeast coast, few Mandarin speakers engaged in overseas emigration until the late 20th century, but there are now significant communities of them in cities across the world.[39]\n\n\n\n### Mainland China[edit]\n\n\nMost Han Chinese living in northern and southwestern China are native speakers of a dialect of Mandarin. The North China Plain provided few barriers to migration, leading to relative linguistic homogeneity over a wide area in northern China. In contrast, the mountains and rivers of southern China have spawned the other six major groups of Chinese varieties, with great internal diversity, particularly in Fujian.[40][41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Formosan | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atayalic | * Atayal\n* Seediq\n\t+ Truku\n |\n| Rukaic | * Rukai\n |\n| Northern | * Babuza\n\t+ Favorlang\n\t+ Taokas\n* Papora\n* Hoanya\n\t+ Arikun\n\t+ Lloa\n* Pazeh\n\t+ Kaxabu\n* Kulon\n* Saisiyat\n* Thao\n |\n| East | * Amis\n* Kavalan\n* Ketagalan\n\t+ Basay\n\t+ Luilang\n* Makatao\n* Qauqaut\n* Sakizaya\n* Siraya\n* Taivoan\n |\n| Southern | * Bunun\n* Paiwan\n* Puyuma\n |\n| Tsouic | * Kanakanavu\n* Saaroa\n* Tsou\n |\n\n |\n| Malayo-Polynesian | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Batanic | * Yami\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Sino-Tibetan | \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sinitic | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Mandarin | * Taiwanese Mandarin\n* Junhua\n |\n| Min | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Mandarin at *Ethnologue* (22nd ed., 2019) ![Closed access icon](image)\n2. **^** \u53f0\u7063\u624b\u8a9e\u7c21\u4ecb (Taiwan shouyu jianjie) (2009)\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Norman (1988), p.\u00a0136.\n4. **^** \"Law of the People's Republic of China on the Standard Spoken and Written Chinese Language (Order of the President No.37)\".

This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the North China Plain compared to the more mountainous south, combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas.\n\n\nMost Mandarin varieties have four tones.

Within Chinese social or cultural discourse, there is not a common \"Mandarin\" identity based on language; rather, there are strong regional identities centred on individual dialects because of the wide geographical distribution and cultural diversity of their speakers. Speakers of forms of Mandarin other than the standard typically refer to the variety they speak by a geographic name\u2014for example the Sichuan dialect and the Hebei dialect or Northeastern dialect, all being regarded as distinct from the standard language, with which they may not share much mutual intelligibility.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the Chinese language\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Jiaoliao Mandarin (35 million), spoken in Shandong (Jiaodong) and Liaodong Peninsulas, as well as in few\u00a0counties of\u00a0Heilongjiang, due to migration.[81] Very noticeable tonal changes, different in \"flavour\" from Ji\u2013Lu Mandarin, but with more variance.

Historically, it was seldom used by the Chinese Singaporean community, which primarily spoke the Southern Chinese languages of Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, or Hakka.[54] The launch of the Speak Mandarin Campaign in 1979 by the government prioritized the language over traditional vernaculars in an attempt to create a common ethnic language and foster closer connections to China.[55] This has led to a significant increase and presence of Mandarin usage in the country, coupled with a strong decline in usage of other Chinese variants.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are also many Chinese words which come from foreign languages such as *g\u0101o'\u011brf\u016b* (\u9ad8\u5c14\u592b) from \"golf\"; *b\u01d0j\u012bn\u00ed* (\u6bd4\u57fa\u5c3c) from \"bikini\", and *h\u00e0nb\u01ceo b\u0101o* (\u6c49\u5821\u5305) from \"hamburger\".\n\n\nIn general, the greatest variation occurs in slang, in kinship terms, in names for common crops and domesticated animals, for common verbs and adjectives, and other such everyday terms. The least variation occurs in \"formal\" vocabulary\u2014terms dealing with science, law, or government.\n\n\n\n## Grammar[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chinese grammar\n\nChinese varieties of all periods are considered prime examples of analytic languages, relying on word order and particles instead of inflection or affixes to provide grammatical information such as person, number, tense, mood, or case.\nAlthough modern varieties, including the Mandarin dialects, use a small number of particles in a similar fashion to suffixes, they are still strongly analytic.[104]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Narom\n* Nonukan Tidong\n* Okolod\n* Paluan\n* Papar\n* Punan Bah-Biau\n* Punan Batu2\n* Penan\n* Remun\n* Sa'ban\n* Sabah Bisaya\n* Sama\n* Sarawak Malay\n* Sebop\n* Sekapan\n* Selungai Murut\n* Sembakung\n* Seru1\n* Serudung\n* Sian\n* Sungai\n* Tagol\n* Timugon\n* Tombonuwo\n* Tring\n* Tringgus\n* Tutoh\n* Ukit2\n* Uma\u02bc Lasan\n |\n\n |\n| Significantminority | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ting, Pang-Hsin (1991), \"Some theoretical issues in the study of Mandarin dialects\", in Wang, William S-Y.

Notable differences include: the merger of retroflex sounds (zh, ch, sh, r) with the alveolar series (z, c, s), frequent mergers of the \"neutral tone\" with a word's original tone, and absence of erhua.[52] Code-switching between Mandarin and Taiwanese Hokkien is common, as the majority of the population continues to also speak the latter as a native language.[53]\n\n\n\n### Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\n#### Singapore[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Singaporean Mandarin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom an official point of view, the mainland Chinese and the Taiwanese governments maintain their own forms of the standard under different names. The codified forms of both *P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0* and *Gu\u00f3y\u01d4* base their phonology on the Beijing accent, and also take some elements from other sources, and deviate from the Beijing dialect in vocabulary, grammar, and pragmatics.[35] Comparison of dictionaries produced in the two areas will show that there are few substantial differences. However, both versions of \"school-standard\" Chinese are often quite different from the Mandarin varieties that are spoken in accordance with regional habits, and neither is wholly identical to the Beijing dialect.[36]\n\n\nThe written forms of Standard Chinese are also essentially equivalent, although simplified characters are used in mainland China and Singapore, while traditional characters remain in use in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.[37] Singapore has followed mainland China in officially adopting simplified characters.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** Wurm, M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler & Tryon 2011, p.\u00a0698. sfn error: no target: CITEREFWurmM\u00fchlh\u00e4uslerTryon2011 (help)\n57. **^** Wang 2012, p.\u00a080. sfn error: no target: CITEREFWang2012 (help)\n58. **^** Aung Thein Kha; Gerin, Roseanne (17 September 2019). \"In Myanmar's Remote Mongla Region, Mandarin Supplants The Burmese Language\". *Radio Free Asia*.

Further, there is a distinction between the plural first-person pronoun *z\u00e1nmen* (\u54b1\u4eec/\u54b1\u5011), which is inclusive of the listener, and *w\u01d2men* (\u6211\u4eec/\u6211\u5011), which may be exclusive of the listener. Dialects of Mandarin agree with each other quite consistently on these pronouns. While the first and second person singular pronouns are cognate with forms in other varieties of Chinese, the rest of the pronominal system is a Mandarin innovation (e.g., Shanghainese has *non* \u4fac/\u5102 'you' and *yi* \u4f0a 'he', 'she').[101]\n\n\nBecause of contact with Mongolian and Manchurian peoples, Mandarin (especially the Northeastern varieties) has some loanwords from these languages not present in other varieties of Chinese, such as *h\u00fat\u00f2ng* (\u80e1\u540c) \"alley\".

As late as 1815, Robert Morrison based the first English\u2013Chinese dictionary on this koin\u00e9 as the standard of the time, though he conceded that the Beijing dialect was gaining in influence.[25] By the middle of the 19th century, the Beijing dialect had become dominant and was essential for any business with the imperial court.[26]\n\n\n\n### Standard Mandarin Chinese[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Standard Chinese\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, the varieties of Mandarin cover a huge area containing nearly a billion people. As a result, there are pronounced regional variations in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar,[42] and many Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible.[b]\n\n\nMost of northeast China, except for Liaoning, did not receive significant settlements by Han Chinese until the 18th century,[48] and as a result the Northeastern Mandarin dialects spoken there differ little from the Beijing dialect.[49] The Manchu people of the area now speak these dialects exclusively; their native language is only maintained in northwestern Xinjiang, where Xibe, a modern dialect, is spoken.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n98. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Norman (1988), p.\u00a0195.\n99. **^** Li Rong's 1985 article on Mandarin classification, quoted in Yan (2006), p.\u00a061 and Kurpaska (2010), p.\u00a089.\n100. **^** Norman (1988), pp.\u00a0195\u2013196.\n101. **^** Norman (1988), pp.\u00a0182, 195\u2013196.\n102. **^** Ramsey (1987), pp.\u00a036\u201338.\n103. **^** Norman, Jerry; Mei, Tsu-lin (1976). \"The Austroasiatics in ancient South China: some lexical evidence\". *Monumenta Serica*. **32**: 274\u2013301. doi:10.1080/02549948.1976.11731121.\n104. **^** Norman (1988), p.\u00a010.\n105. **^** Norman (1988), p.\u00a0162.\n106. **^** Yue (2003), pp.\u00a0105\u2013106.\n107. **^** Yue (2003), pp.\u00a090\u201393.\n108. **^** Norman (1988), p.\u00a0196.\n109. **^** Yue (2003), pp.\u00a0113\u2013115.\n\n### Sources[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe *Zhongyuan Yinyun* shows the typical Mandarin four-tone system resulting from a split of the \"even\" tone and loss of the entering tone, with its syllables distributed across the other tones (though their different origin is marked in the dictionary). Similarly, voiced plosives and affricates have become voiceless aspirates in the \"even\" tone and voiceless non-aspirates in others, another distinctive Mandarin development. However, the language still retained a final *-m*, which has merged with *-n* in modern dialects and initial voiced fricatives. It also retained the distinction between velars and alveolar sibilants in palatal environments, which later merged in most Mandarin dialects to yield a palatal series (rendered *j-*, *q-* and *x-* in pinyin).[18]\n\n\nThe flourishing vernacular literature of the period also shows distinctively Mandarin vocabulary and syntax, though some, such as the third-person pronoun *t\u0101* (\u4ed6), can be traced back to the Tang dynasty.[19]\n\n\n\n### Vernacular literature[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe widely accepted seven-group classification of Yuan Jiahua in 1960 kept Xiang and Gan separate, with Mandarin divided into Northern, Northwestern, Southwestern and Jiang\u2013Huai (Lower Yangtze) subgroups.[64][65]\nOf Yuan's four Mandarin subgroups, the Northwestern dialects are the most diverse, particularly in the province of Shanxi.[39] The linguist Li Rong proposed that the northwestern dialects of Shanxi and neighbouring areas that retain a final glottal stop in the Middle Chinese entering tone (plosive-final) category should constitute a separate top-level group called Jin.[66] He used this classification in the *Language Atlas of China* (1987).[13] Many other linguists continue to include these dialects in the Mandarin group, pointing out that the Lower Yangtze dialects also retain the glottal stop.[67][68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe English word \"mandarin\" (from Portuguese *mandarim*, from Malay *menteri*, from Sanskrit *mantr\u012b*, *mantrin*, meaning 'minister or counsellor') originally meant an official of the Ming and Qing empires.[7][8][a]\nSince their native varieties were often mutually unintelligible, these officials communicated using a koin\u00e9 language based on various northern varieties. When Jesuit missionaries learned this standard language in the 16th century, they called it \"Mandarin\", from its Chinese name *Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0* (\u5b98\u8bdd; \u5b98\u8a71; 'language of the officials').[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hanoish | * Akeu\n* Akha\n* Amu\n* Angluo\n* Asuo\n* Baihong\n* Bisu\n* Budu\n* Bukong\n* Cosao\n* Duoni\n* Duota\n* Enu\n* Habei\n* Hani\n* Honi\n* Jino\n* Kabie\n* Kaduo\n* Lami\n* Laomian\n* Laopin\n* Mpi\n* Muda\n* Nuobi\n* Nuomei\n* Phana\u2019\n* Piyo\n* Qidi\n* Sadu\n* Sangkong\n* Suobi\n* Tsukong\n* Woni\n* Yiche\n |\n| Lisoish | * Eka\n* Hlersu\n* Kua-nsi\n* Kuamasi\n* Laizisi\n* Lalo\n* Lamu\n* Lavu\n* Lawu\n* Limi\n* Lipo\n* Lisu\n* Lolopo\n* Mangdi\n* Micha\n* Mili\n* Sonaga\n* Toloza\n* Xuzhang\n* Yangliu\n* Zibusi\n |\n| Nisoish | * Alingpo\n* Alugu\n* Aluo\n* Axi\n* Azha\n* Azhe\n* Bokha\n* Gepo\n* Khlula\n* Lope\n* Moji\n* Muji\n* Muzi\n* Nasu\n* Nisu\n* Nuosu\n* Phala\n* Phola\n* Phowa\n* Phukha\n* Phuma\n* Phupa\n* Phupha\n* Phuza\n* Samei\n* Sani\n* Thopho\n* Zokhuo\n |\n| Other | * Gokhy\n* Katso\n* Kucong\n* Lahu\n* Naruo\n* Namuyi\n* Naxi\n* Nusu\n* Samu\n* Sanie\n* Zauzou\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Baxter, William H.

In the early years of the Republic of China, intellectuals of the New Culture Movement, such as Hu Shih and Chen Duxiu, successfully campaigned for the replacement of Literary Chinese as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on northern dialects. A parallel priority was the definition of a standard national language (traditional Chinese: \u570b\u8a9e; simplified Chinese: \u56fd\u8bed; pinyin: *Gu\u00f3y\u01d4*; Wade\u2013Giles: *Kuo\u00b2-y\u00fc\u00b3*). After much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at an artificial pronunciation, the National Language Unification Commission finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932. The People's Republic, founded in 1949, retained this standard, calling it *p\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0* (simplified Chinese: \u666e\u901a\u8bdd; traditional Chinese: \u666e\u901a\u8a71; lit. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are more polysyllabic words in Mandarin than in all other major varieties of Chinese except Shanghainese[*citation needed*]. This is partly because Mandarin has undergone many more sound changes than have southern varieties of Chinese, and has needed to deal with many more homophones. New words have been formed by adding affixes such as *lao-* (\u8001), *-zi* (\u5b50), *-(e)r* (\u513f/\u5152), and *-tou* (\u5934/\u982d), or by compounding, e.g. by combining two words of similar meaning as in *c\u014dngm\u00e1ng* (\u5306\u5fd9), made from elements meaning \"hurried\" and \"busy\".\nA distinctive feature of southwestern Mandarin is its frequent use of noun reduplication, which is hardly used in Beijing. In Sichuan, one hears *b\u0101ob\u0101o* (\u5305\u5305) \"handbag\" where Beijing uses *b\u0101or* (\u5305\u513f).\nThere are also a small number of words that have been polysyllabic since Old Chinese, such as *h\u00fadi\u00e9* (\u8774\u8776) 'butterfly'.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Eastern | * Fuzhou\n* Fuqing\n* Fu'an\n* Manjiang\n |\n| Southern | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hokkien | * Quanzhou\n* Zhangzhou\n* Amoy\n* Chawan\n* Taiwan\n* Philippine\n* Pedan\n* Penang\n* Singapore\n* Malaysian\n |\n| Teochew | * Swatow\n* Hoklo\n |\n| Zhongshan | * Nanlang\n* Sanxiang\n |\n| Other | * Zhenan\n* Longyan\n |\n\n |\n| Other | * Northern\n\t+ Jian'ou\n\t+ Jianyang\n* Central\n* Pu\u2013Xian\n* Shao\u2013Jiang\n* Leizhou\n\t+ Zhanjiang\n* Hainan\n |\n\n |\n| Hakka | * Meixian\n* Wuhua\n* Huizhou\n* Tingzhou\n\t+ Changting\n* Taiwanese\n\t+ Sixian\n\t+ Hailu\n\t+ Raoping\n |\n| Yue | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yuehai | * Guangzhou\n\t+ Hong Kong\n* Xiguan\n* Jiujiang\n* Shiqi\n* Weitou\n* Dapeng\n |\n| Siyi | * Taishan\n* Xinhui\n |\n| Other | * Gao\u2013Yang\n* Goulou\n* Wu\u2013Hua\n* Yong\u2013Xun\n* Luo\u2013Guang\n* Qin\u2013Lian\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Stent, George Carter; Hemeling, Karl (1905), *A Dictionary from English to Colloquial Mandarin Chinese*, Shanghai: Statistical Department of the Inspectorate General of Customs.\n* Whymant, A.

Many border varieties have a mixture of features that make them difficult to classify.\nThe boundary between Southwestern Mandarin and Xiang is particularly weak,[69] and in many early classifications the two were not separated.[70] Zhou Zhenhe and You Rujie include the New Xiang dialects within Southwestern Mandarin, treating only the more conservative Old Xiang dialects as a separate group.[71]\nThe Huizhou dialects have features of both Mandarin and Wu, and have been assigned to one or other of these groups or treated as separate by various authors. Li Rong and the *Language Atlas of China* treated it as a separate top-level group, but this remains controversial.[72][73]\n\n\n\n### Subgroups[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the Beijing dialect that underlies the standard language, syllables beginning with original voiceless consonants were redistributed across the four tones in a completely random pattern.[98] For example, the three characters \u7a4d\u810a\u8de1, all *tsjek* in Middle Chinese (William H. Baxter's transcription), are now pronounced *j\u012b*, *j\u01d0* and *j\u00ec* respectively. Older dictionaries such as *Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary* mark characters whose pronunciation formerly ended with a stop with a superscript 5; however, this tone number is more commonly used for syllables that always have a neutral tone (see below).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStandard Singaporean Mandarin is nearly identical to the standards of China and Taiwan, with minor vocabulary differences. It is the Mandarin variant used in education, media, and official settings. Meanwhile, a colloquial form called Singdarin is used in informal daily life and is heavily influenced in terms of both grammar and vocabulary by local languages such as Cantonese, Hokkien, and Malay. Instances of code-switching with English, Hokkien, Cantonese, Malay, or a combination of any of these is also common.\n\n\n\n#### Malaysia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Malaysian Mandarin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u5320 | *ji\u00e0ng* | a technician in a certain field\n | \u82b1\u5320, \u6cb9\u6f06\u5320, \u6728\u5320 | 'gardener', 'painter', 'carpenter\n |\n| \u8ff7 | *m\u00ed* | an enthusiast\n | \u620f\u8ff7; \u6232\u8ff7, \u7403\u8ff7, \u6b4c\u8ff7 | 'theater fan', 'sports fan', 'groupie (of a musician)'\n |\n| \u5e08; \u5e2b | *sh\u012b* | suffix for occupations\n | \u6559\u5e08; \u6559\u5e2b \u53a8\u5e08; \u5eda\u5e2b, \u5f8b\u5e08]; \u5f8b\u5e2b | 'teacher', 'chef', 'lawyer'\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Language portal\n\n\n* Chinese dictionary\n* Transcription into Chinese characters\n* Written Chinese\n* Languages of China\n* List of varieties of Chinese\n* *Linguistic Atlas of Chinese Dialects*\n* List of languages by number of native speakers\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A folk etymology deriving the name from *M\u01cen d\u00e0 r\u00e9n* (\u6ee1\u5927\u4eba; \u6eff\u5927\u4eba; 'Manchu big man') is without foundation.[9]\n2. **^** For example:\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Most Mandarin-speaking areas distinguish between the retroflex initials /\u0288\u0282 \u0288\u0282\u02b0 \u0282/ from the apical sibilants /ts ts\u02b0 s/, though they often have a different distribution than in the standard language.

The alternative term *B\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0* (\u5317\u65b9\u8bdd; \u5317\u65b9\u8a71; 'Northern dialects'), is used less and less among Chinese linguists. By extension, the term \"Old Mandarin\" or \"Early Mandarin\" is used by linguists to refer to the northern dialects recorded in materials from the Yuan dynasty.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn general, no two Mandarin-speaking areas have exactly the same set of tone values, but most Mandarin-speaking areas have very similar tone *distribution*. For example, the dialects of Jinan, Chengdu, Xi'an and so on all have four tones that correspond quite well to the Beijing dialect tones of [\u02e5] (55), [\u02e7\u02e5] (35), [\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6] (214), and [\u02e5\u02e9] (51). The exception to this rule lies in the distribution of syllables formerly ending in a stop consonant, which are treated differently in different dialects of Mandarin.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost Mandarin dialects have three medial glides, /j/, /w/ and /\u0265/ (spelled *i*, *u* and *\u00fc* in pinyin), though their incidence varies.\nThe medial /w/, is lost after apical initials in several areas.[93]\nThus Southwestern Mandarin has /tei/ \"correct\" where the standard language has *dui* /twei/.\nSouthwestern Mandarin also has /kai k\u02b0ai xai/ in some words where the standard has *jie qie xie* /t\u0255j\u025b t\u0255\u02b0j\u025b \u0255j\u025b/. This is a stereotypical feature of southwestern Mandarin, since it is so easily noticeable. E.g. *hai* \"shoe\" for standard *xie*, *gai* \"street\" for standard *jie*.\n\n\nMandarin dialects typically have relatively few vowels. Syllabic fricatives, as in standard *zi* and *zhi*, are common in Mandarin dialects, though they also occur elsewhere.[95]\nThe Middle Chinese off-glides /j/ and /w/ are generally preserved in Mandarin dialects, yielding several diphthongs and triphthongs in contrast to the larger sets of monophthongs common in other dialect groups (and some widely scattered Mandarin dialects).[95]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe literary language was less appropriate for documents that were meant to be performed or recited, such as plays or stories. From at least the Yuan dynasty plays that recounted the subversive tales of China's Robin Hoods to the Ming dynasty novels such as *Water Margin*, on down to the Qing dynasty novel *Dream of the Red Chamber* and beyond, there developed a literature in written vernacular Chinese (\u767d\u8bdd; \u767d\u8a71; *b\u00e1ihu\u00e0*). In many cases, this written language reflected Mandarin varieties and since pronunciation differences were not conveyed in this written form, this tradition had a unifying force across all the Mandarin-speaking regions and beyond.[20]\n\n\nHu Shih, a pivotal figure of the first half of the twentieth century, wrote an influential and perceptive study of this literary tradition, entitled \"A History of Vernacular Literature\" (*B\u00e1ihu\u00e0 W\u00e9nxu\u00e9sh\u01d0*).\n\n\n\n### Late imperial koin\u00e9[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA syllable consists maximally of an initial consonant, a medial glide, a vowel, a coda, and tone. In the traditional analysis, the medial, vowel and coda are combined as a *final*.[90]\nNot all combinations occur. For example, Standard Chinese (based on the Beijing dialect) has about 1,200 distinct syllables.[91]\n\n\nPhonological features that are generally shared by the Mandarin dialects include:\n\n\n\n* the palatalization of velar consonants and alveolar sibilants when they occur before palatal glides;\n* one syllable contains maximum four phonemes (maximum three vowels and no consonant cluster)\n* the disappearance of final stop consonants and /-m/ (although in many Lower Yangtze Mandarin and Jin Chinese dialects, an echo of the final stops is preserved as a glottal stop);\n* the presence of retroflex consonants (although these are absent in many Southwestern and Northeastern Mandarin dialects);\n* the historical devoicing of stops and sibilants (also common to most non-Mandarin varieties).\n\n\n### Initials[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, most Chinese people living in many parts of South China spoke only their local variety. As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as *Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0*. Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.[3]\n\n\nOfficials varied widely in their pronunciation; in 1728, the Yongzheng Emperor, unable to understand the accents of officials from Guangdong and Fujian, issued a decree requiring the governors of those provinces to provide for the teaching of proper pronunciation. Although the resulting Academies for Correct Pronunciation (\u6b63\u97f3\u66f8\u9662; *Zh\u00e8ngy\u012bn Sh\u016byu\u00e0n*) were short-lived, the decree did spawn a number of textbooks that give some insight into the ideal pronunciation. Common features included:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1936, Wang Li produced the first classification based on phonetic criteria, principally the evolution of Middle Chinese voiced initials. His Mandarin group included dialects of northern and southwestern China, as well as those of Hunan and northern Jiangxi.[62]\nLi Fang-Kuei's classification of 1937 distinguished the latter two groups as Xiang and Gan, while splitting the remaining Mandarin dialects between Northern, Lower Yangtze and Southwestern Mandarin groups.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Lower Yangtze dialects, a minority of Southwestern dialects (e.g. Minjiang) and Jin Chinese (sometimes considered non-Mandarin), former final stops were not deleted entirely, but were reduced to a glottal stop /\u0294/.[98] (This includes the dialect of Nanjing on which the Postal Romanization was based; it transcribes the glottal stop as a trailing *h*.) This development is shared with Wu Chinese and is thought to represent the pronunciation of Old Mandarin. In line with traditional Chinese phonology, dialects such as Lower Yangtze and Minjiang are thus said to have five tones instead of four. However, modern linguistics considers these syllables as having no phonemic tone at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

With a population of over 410 million, Hispanophone America accounts for the vast majority of Spanish speakers, of which Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country. In the European Union, Spanish is the mother tongue of 8% of the population, with an additional 7% speaking it as a second language.[206] Additionally, Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States and is by far the most popular foreign language among students.[207] In 2015, it was estimated that over 50 million Americans spoke Spanish, about 41 million of whom were native speakers.[208] With continued immigration and increased use of the language domestically in public spheres and media, the number of Spanish speakers in the United States is expected to continue growing over the forthcoming decades.[209]\n\n\n\n## Dialectal variation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *World Population Prospects*, EU, archived from the original on 10 May 2015\n\t* *Eurobarometer* (PDF), 2012, archived (PDF) from the original on 29 April 2013, retrieved 12 April 2013, Page TS2: Population older than 15 years old of each country. page T74: Speakers who speak Spanish very well.

The indicative mood is the unmarked one, while the subjunctive mood expresses uncertainty or indetermination, and is commonly paired with the conditional, which is a mood used to express \"would\" (as in, \"I would eat if I had food); the imperative is a mood to express a command, commonly a one word phrase \u2013 \"\u00a1Di!\", \"\u00a1Talk!\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Countries members of the ASALE[241]\nThe Association of Spanish Language Academies (*Asociaci\u00f3n de Academias de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola*, or *ASALE*) is the entity which regulates the Spanish language.

The Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands, traces its origins back to the Castilian conquest in the 15th century, and, in addition to a resemblance to Western Andalusian speech patterns, it also features strong influence from the Spanish varieties spoken in the Americas,[53] which in turn have also been influenced historically by Canarian Spanish.[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn addition to sharing most of its borders with Spanish-speaking countries, the creation of Mercosur in the early 1990s induced a favorable situation for the promotion of Spanish language teaching in Brazil.[42][43] In 2005, the National Congress of Brazil approved a bill, signed into law by the President, making it mandatory for schools to offer Spanish as an alternative foreign language course in both public and private secondary schools in Brazil.[44] In September 2016 this law was revoked by Michel Temer after the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff.[45] In many border towns and villages along Paraguay and Uruguay, a mixed language known as Portu\u00f1ol is spoken.[46]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\n#### Sub-Saharan Africa[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Equatoguinean Spanish\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSpanish was briefly removed from official status in 1973 but reimplemented under the administration of Ferdinand Marcos two months later.[63] It remained an official language until the ratification of the present constitution in 1987, in which it was re-designated as a voluntary and optional auxiliary language.[64] In recent years changing attitudes among non-Spanish speaking Filipinos have helped spur a revival of the language,[65][66] and starting in 2009 Spanish was reintroduced as part of the basic education curriculum in a number of public high schools, becoming the largest foreign language program offered by the public school system,[67] with over 7,000 students studying the language in the 2021\u20132022 school year alone.[68] The local business process outsourcing industry has also helped boost the language's economic prospects.[69] Today, while the actual number of proficient Spanish speakers is around 400,000, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ladefoged, Peter; Johnson, Keith (2010), *A Course in Phonetics* (6th\u00a0ed.), Boston, Massachusetts: Wadsworth Publishing, ISBN\u00a0978-1-4282-3126-9, archived from the original on 24 March 2019, retrieved 17 June 2015\n* Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n, Eugenio; Fern\u00e1ndez-Planas, Ana Ma.; Carrera-Sabat\u00e9, Josefina (2003). \"Castilian Spanish\". *Journal of the International Phonetic Association*. **33** (2): 255\u201359. doi:10.1017/S0025100303001373.\n* Moreno Fern\u00e1ndez, Francisco; Otero, Jaime (2008), *Atlas de la lengua espa\u00f1ola en el mundo*, Barcelona: Ariel\n* Penny, Ralph (1991). *A History of the Spanish Language*.

Now the majority of the United States population are monolingual English speakers,[71][102] and English has been given official or co-official status by 30 of the 50 state governments, as well as all five territorial governments of the US, though there has never been an official language at the federal level.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### English as a global language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English as a lingua franca\n\nSee also: Foreign-language influences in English and Study of global communication\n\n![](image)Countries in which English language is a mandatory or an optional subject[105]English is a mandatory subject\nEnglish is an optional subject\nNo data\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * **Countries and territories where English is an official language, but not the majority first language**\n |\n| Africa | * Botswana\n* Cameroon\n* Eswatini\n* The Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Kenya\n* Lesotho\n* Liberia\n* Malawi\n* Mauritius\n* Namibia\n* Nigeria\n* Rwanda\n* Sierra Leone\n* Somaliland\n* South Africa\n* South Sudan\n* Sudan\n* Tanzania\n* Uganda\n* Zambia\n* Zimbabwe\n |\n| Americas | * *Puerto Rico*\n |\n| Asia | * *Christmas Island*\n* *Cocos (Keeling) Islands*\n* *Hong Kong*\n* India\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Singapore\n |\n| Europe | * *Gibraltar*\n* *Akrotiri and Dhekelia*\n* Malta\n |\n| Oceania | * *American Samoa*\n* Cook Islands\n* Fiji\n* *Guam*\n* Kiribati\n* Marshall Islands\n* Micronesia\n* Nauru\n* Niue\n* *Northern Mariana Islands*\n* Palau\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Samoa\n* Solomon Islands\n* *Tokelau*\n* Tuvalu\n* Vanuatu\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Dependencies shown in *italics*.\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIndia now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world,[115] but the number of English speakers in India is uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.[116]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nModern English, sometimes described as the first global lingua franca,[59][117] is also regarded as the first world language.[118][119] English is the world's most widely used language in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass entertainment, and diplomacy.[119] English is, by international treaty, the basis for the required controlled natural languages[120] Seaspeak and Airspeak, used as international languages of seafaring[121] and aviation.[122] English used to have parity with French and German in scientific research, but now it dominates that field.[123] It achieved parity with French as a language of diplomacy at the Treaty of Versailles negotiations in 1919.[124] By the time of the foundation of the United Nations at the end of World War II, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBritish English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the United States as a world power.[64][65][66]\n\n\n\n## Geographical distribution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of countries and territories where English is an official language, List of countries by English-speaking population, and English-speaking world\n\n![](image)Percentage of native speakers of English and English creoles globally as of 2017\n![](image)Majority native language\n Co-official and majority native language\n Official but minority native language\n Secondary language: spoken as a second language by more than 20% of the population, *de facto* working language of government, language of instruction in education, etc.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ammon, Ulrich (2008). \"Pluricentric and Divided Languages\".

While the European Union (EU) allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.[128]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the three-circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language, make up the \"expanding circle\".[87] The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time.[86] For example, in the Netherlands and some other countries of Europe, knowledge of English as a second language is nearly universal, with over 80 percent of the population able to use it,[88] and thus English is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education. In these countries, although English is not used for government business, its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the \"outer circle\" and \"expanding circle\". English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language.[89]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use the language.[90] Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties.[91] Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries. This is particularly true of the shared vocabulary of mathematics and the sciences.[92]\n\n\n\n### Pluricentric English[edit]\n\n\nPie chart showing the percentage of native English speakers living in \"inner circle\" English-speaking countries.

Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages.[243] Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script.[244] Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.[244]\n\n\n\n## Writing system[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies.[56][57][110] For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India.[111] English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK.[112] However, English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India.[113][114] David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)**Anglic languages** English\n Scots\n within the **Anglo-Frisian languages**, which also include Frisian (West, North, Saterland);\n within the **North Sea Germanic languages**, which also include Low German/Saxon;\n within the **West Germanic languages**, which also include Dutch in Europe and Afrikaans in Africa\n ......

Most people learn English for practical rather than ideological reasons.[108] Many speakers of English in Africa have become part of an \"Afro-Saxon\" language community that unites Africans from different countries.[109]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThose countries have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole to a more standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English as they grow up through day-to-day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by non-native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners.[79] Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries,[79] and they may show grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.[79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Leech, Geoffrey; Hundt, Marianne; Mair, Christian; Smith, Nicholas (2009). *Change in contemporary English: a grammatical study* (PDF).

Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and mathematics.[237] English continues to gain new loanwords and calques (\"loan translations\") from languages all over the world, and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo-Saxon language make up about 60% of the vocabulary of English.[238]\n\n\nEnglish has formal and informal speech registers; informal registers, including child-directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.[239][240]\n\n\n\n### English loanwords and calques in other languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Englishization\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n128. **^** Ammon 2006, p.\u00a0321.\n129. **^** European Commission 2012, pp.\u00a021, 19.\n130. **^** Alcaraz Ariza & Navarro 2006.\n131. **^** Brutt-Griffler 2006, pp.\u00a0694\u201395.\n132. **^** \"Globish \u2013 a language of international business?\". *Global Lingo*. 2 April 2012.

Through all types of printed and electronic media in these countries, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the *lingua franca* in many regions and professional contexts such as science, navigation, and law.[4] Its modern grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent-marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection and a fairly fixed subject\u2013verb\u2013object word order.[28] Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspects and moods, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives, and some negation.\n\n\n\n### Proto-Germanic to Old English[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Old English\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs *speak/spoke* and *foot/feet*) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as *love/loved*, *hand/hands*).[175] Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system (*he/him, who/whom*) and in the inflection of the copula verb *to be*.[175]\n\n\nThe seven word-classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:[176]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *The* | *chairman* | *of* | *the* | *committee* | *and* | *the* | *loquacious* | *politician* | *clashed* | *violently* | *when* | *the* | *meeting* | *started*.\n |\n| Det. | Noun | Prep. | Det. | Noun | Conj. | Det. | Adj. | Noun | Verb | Advb. | Conj. | Det. | Noun | Verb\n |\n\n\n### Nouns and noun phrases[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Mair, C.; Leech, G.

English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by *Chemical Abstracts* in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.[131]\n\n\nInternational communities such as international business people may use English as an auxiliary language, with an emphasis on vocabulary suitable for their domain of interest. This has led some scholars to develop the study of English as an auxiliary language. The trademarked Globish uses a relatively small subset of English vocabulary (about 1500 words, designed to represent the highest use in international business English) in combination with the standard English grammar.[132] Other examples include Simple English.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bao, Z.

Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality linguistic corpora,[225] collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.[224][226]\n\n\n\n### Word formation processes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n208. **^** K\u00f6nig 1994, p.\u00a0550.\n209. **^** \"Cases of Nouns and Pronouns\". *Guide to Grammar and Writing*.

In County Wexford, in the area surrounding Dublin, two extinct dialects known as Forth and Bargy and Fingallian developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern Irish English, however, has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into Ulster English, the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots, and various dialects of the Republic of Ireland. Like Scottish and most North American accents, almost all Irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in the dialects influenced by RP.[18][271]\n\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American English, General American, Southern American English, African-American Vernacular English, Canadian English, and Atlantic Canadian English\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\nSpeech example\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEnglish is spoken widely in southern Africa and is an official or co-official language in several countries. In South Africa, English has been spoken since 1820, co-existing with Afrikaans and various African languages such as the Khoe and Bantu languages. Today, about 9 percent of the South African population speaks South African English (SAE) as a first language. SAE is a non-rhotic variety, which tends to follow RP as a norm. It is one of the few non-rhotic English varieties that lack intrusive R. There are different L2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers.[299] Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.[300] Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce /p, t, t\u0361\u0283, k/ without aspiration (e.g. *pin* pronounced [p\u026an] rather than as [p\u02b0\u026an] as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap [\u027e] instead of as the more common fricative.[301]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Gordon, Elizabeth; Campbell, Lyle; Hay, Jennifer; Maclagan, Margaret; Sudbury, Angela; Trudgill, Peter (2004). *New Zealand English: its origins and evolution*.

There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1\u00a0million words\u2014but that count presumably includes words such as Latin species names, scientific terminology, botanical terms, prefixed and suffixed words, jargon, foreign words of extremely limited English use, and technical acronyms.[224]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnlike Icelandic and Faroese, which were isolated, the development of English was influenced by a long series of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, particularly Old Norse and Norman French. These left a profound mark of their own on the language, so that English shows some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with many languages outside its linguistic clades\u2014but it is not mutually intelligible with any of those languages either. Some scholars have argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a creole\u2014a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis. Although the great influence of these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.[20][21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

ASL is a complete and organized visual language that is expressed by employing both manual and nonmanual features.[5] Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca. ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a creole language of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as agglutinative morphology.\n\n\nASL originated in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has been propagated widely by schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken. Reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults and other hearing individuals.\n\n\nASL signs have a number of phonemic components, such as movement of the face, the torso, and the hands. ASL is not a form of pantomime although iconicity plays a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling, although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers. Many linguists believe ASL to be a subject\u2013verb\u2013object language. However, there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.\n\n\n\n\n## Classification[edit]\n\n\nTravis Dougherty explains and demonstrates the ASL alphabet. Voice-over interpretation by Gilbert G. Lensbower.\nASL emerged as a language in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded by Thomas Gallaudet in 1817,[6]:\u200a7 which brought together Old French Sign Language, various village sign languages, and home sign systems. ASL was created in that situation by language contact.[7]:\u200a11[a] ASL was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them.[6]:\u200a7\n\n\nThe influence of French Sign Language (LSF) on ASL is readily apparent; for example, it has been found that about 58% of signs in modern ASL are cognate to Old French Sign Language signs.[6]:\u200a7[7]:\u200a14 However, that is far less than the standard 80% measure used to determine whether related languages are actually dialects.[7]:\u200a14 That suggests that nascent ASL was highly affected by the other signing systems brought by the ASD students although the school's original director, Laurent Clerc, taught in LSF.[6]:\u200a7[7]:\u200a14 In fact, Clerc reported that he often learned the students' signs rather than conveying LSF:[7]:\u200a14\n\n\n\n\n> I see, however, and I say it with regret, that any efforts that we have made or may still be making, to do better than, we have inadvertently fallen somewhat back of Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e. Some of us have learned and still learn signs from uneducated pupils, instead of learning them from well instructed and experienced teachers.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aClerc, 1852, from Woodward 1978:336\n> \n\n\nIt has been proposed that ASL is a creole in which LSF is the superstrate language and the native village sign languages are substrate languages.[8]:\u200a493 However, more recent research has shown that modern ASL does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages.[8]:\u200a501 ASL may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time, but it is also possible that it was never a creole-type language.[8]:\u200a501 There are modality-specific reasons that sign languages tend towards agglutination, such as the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, torso, and other body parts. That might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology.[8]:\u200a502 Additionally, Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true LSF.[8]:\u200a497\n\n\nAlthough the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share English as a common oral and written language, ASL is not mutually intelligible with either British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan.[9]:\u200a68 All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but that alone is not sufficient for cross-language comprehension.[9]:\u200a68 It has been found that a relatively high percentage (37\u201344%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family.[9]:\u200a69 However, that does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that the resemblance is caused by the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general as well as contact with English.[9]:\u200a70\n\n\nAmerican Sign Language is growing in popularity in many states. Many high school and university students desire to take it as a foreign language, but until recently, it was usually not considered a creditable foreign language elective. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture, and they interact very differently when they talk. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are communicating. They also have their own sentence structure, which sets the language apart.[10]\n\n\nAmerican Sign Language is now being accepted by many colleges as a language eligible for foreign language course credit;[11] many states are making it mandatory to accept it as such.[12] In some states however, this is only true with regard to high school coursework.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![signing man sitting in the foreground, with a speaker standing at a podium in the background](image)A sign language interpreter at a presentation\nPrior to the birth of ASL, sign language had been used by various communities in the United States.[6]:\u200a5 In the United States, as elsewhere in the world, hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad hoc home sign, which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation.[6]:\u200a5 As early as 1541 at first contact by Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado, there were reports that the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains widely spoke a sign language to communicate across vast national and linguistic lines.[13]:\u200a80\n\n\nIn the 19th century, a \"triangle\" of village sign languages developed in New England: one in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts; one in Henniker, New Hampshire, and one in Sandy River Valley, Maine.[14] Martha's Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL), which was particularly important for the history of ASL, was used mainly in Chilmark, Massachusetts.[6]:\u200a5\u20136 Due to intermarriage in the original community of English settlers of the 1690s, and the recessive nature of genetic deafness, Chilmark had a high 4% rate of genetic deafness.[6]:\u200a5\u20136 MVSL was used even by hearing residents whenever a deaf person was present,[6]:\u200a5\u20136 and also in some situations where spoken language would be ineffective or inappropriate, such as during church sermons or between boats at sea.[15]\n\n\nASL is thought to have originated in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817.[6]:\u200a4 Originally known as *The American Asylum, At Hartford, For The Education And Instruction Of The Deaf And Dumb*, the school was founded by the Yale graduate and divinity student Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet.[16][17] Gallaudet, inspired by his success in demonstrating the learning abilities of a young deaf girl Alice Cogswell, traveled to Europe in order to learn deaf pedagogy from European institutions.[16] Ultimately, Gallaudet chose to adopt the methods of the French Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, and convinced Laurent Clerc, an assistant to the school's founder Charles-Michel de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e, to accompany him back to the United States.[16][b] Upon his return, Gallaudet founded the ASD on April 15, 1817.[16]\n\n\nThe largest group of students during the first seven decades of the school were from Martha's Vineyard, and they brought MVSL with them.[7]:\u200a10 There were also 44 students from around Henniker, New Hampshire, and 27 from the Sandy River valley in Maine, each of which had their own village sign language.[7]:\u200a11[c] Other students brought knowledge of their own home signs.[7]:\u200a11 Laurent Clerc, the first teacher at ASD, taught using French Sign Language (LSF), which itself had developed in the Parisian school for the deaf established in 1755.[6]:\u200a7 From that situation of language contact, a new language emerged, now known as ASL.[6]:\u200a7\n\n\n\n![man standing on a stage in the foreground addressing a seated crowd](image)American Sign Language Convention of March 2008 in Austin, Texas\nMore schools for the deaf were founded after ASD, and knowledge of ASL spread to those schools.[6]:\u200a7 In addition, the rise of Deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of ASL.[6]:\u200a8 Societies such as the National Association of the Deaf and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country.[7]:\u200a13 All of that contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.[7]:\u200a14[7]:\u200a12\n\n\nWhile oralism, an approach to educating deaf students focusing on oral language, had previously been used in American schools, the Milan Congress made it dominant and effectively banned the use of sign languages at schools in the United States and Europe. However, the efforts of Deaf advocates and educators, more lenient enforcement of the Congress's mandate, and the use of ASL in religious education and proselytism ensured greater use and documentation compared to European sign languages, albeit more influenced by fingerspelled loanwords and borrowed idioms from English as students were societally pressured to achieve fluency in spoken language.[20] Nevertheless, oralism remained the predominant method of deaf education up to the 1950s.[21] Linguists did not consider sign language to be true \"language\" but as something inferior.[21] Recognition of the legitimacy of ASL was achieved by William Stokoe, a linguist who arrived at Gallaudet University in 1955 when that was still the dominant assumption.[21] Aided by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, Stokoe argued for manualism, the use of sign language in deaf education.[21][22] Stokoe noted that sign language shares the important features that oral languages have as a means of communication, and even devised a transcription system for ASL.[21] In doing so, Stokoe revolutionized both deaf education and linguistics.[21] In the 1960s, ASL was sometimes referred to as \"Ameslan\", but that term is now considered obsolete.[23]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nCounting the number of ASL signers is difficult because ASL users have never been counted by the American census.[24]:\u200a1[d] The ultimate source for current estimates of the number of ASL users in the United States is a report for the National Census of the Deaf Population (NCDP) by Schein and Delk (1974).[24]:\u200a17 Based on a 1972 survey of the NCDP, Schein and Delk provided estimates consistent with a signing population between 250,000 and 500,000.[24]:\u200a26 The survey did not distinguish between ASL and other forms of signing; in fact, the name \"ASL\" was not yet in widespread use.[24]:\u200a18\n\n\nIncorrect figures are sometimes cited for the population of ASL users in the United States based on misunderstandings of known statistics.[24]:\u200a20 Demographics of the deaf population have been confused with those of ASL use since adults who become deaf late in life rarely use ASL in the home.[24]:\u200a21 That accounts for currently-cited estimations that are greater than 500,000; such mistaken estimations can reach as high as 15,000,000.[24]:\u200a1,\u200a21 A 100,000-person lower bound has been cited for ASL users; the source of that figure is unclear, but it may be an estimate of prelingual deafness, which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing.[24]:\u200a22\n\n\nASL is sometimes incorrectly cited as the third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States.[24]:\u200a15,\u200a22 Those figures misquote Schein and Delk (1974), who actually concluded that ASL speakers constituted the third-largest population \"requiring an interpreter in court\".[24]:\u200a15,\u200a22 Although that would make ASL the third-most used language among monolinguals other than English, it does not imply that it is the fourth-most-spoken language in the United States since speakers of other languages may also speak English.[24]:\u200a21\u201322\n\n\n\n## Geographic distribution[edit]\n\n\nASL is used throughout Anglo-America.[7]:\u200a12 That contrasts with Europe, where a variety of sign languages are used within the same continent.[7]:\u200a12 The unique situation of ASL seems to have been caused by the proliferation of ASL through schools influenced by the American School for the Deaf, wherein ASL originated, and the rise of community organizations for the Deaf.[7]:\u200a12\u201314\n\n\nThroughout West Africa, ASL-based sign languages are signed by educated Deaf adults.[25]:\u200a410 Such languages, imported by boarding schools, are often considered by associations to be the official sign languages of their countries and are named accordingly, such as Nigerian Sign Language, Ghanaian Sign Language.[25]:\u200a410 Such signing systems are found in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Liberia, Mauritania, Mali, Nigeria, and Togo.[25]:\u200a406 Due to lack of data, it is still an open question how similar those sign languages are to the variety of ASL used in America.[25]:\u200a411\n\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned West African countries, ASL is reported to be used as a first language in Barbados, Bolivia, Cambodia[26] (alongside Cambodian Sign Language), the Central African Republic, Chad, China (Hong Kong), the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Jamaica, Kenya, Madagascar, the Philippines, Singapore, and Zimbabwe.[1] ASL is also used as a lingua franca throughout the deaf world, widely learned as a second language.[1]\n\n\n\n## Regional variation[edit]\n\n\n### Sign production[edit]\n\n\nSign production can often vary according to location. Signers from the South tend to sign with more flow and ease. Native signers from New York have been reported as signing comparatively quicker and sharper. Sign production of native Californian signers has also been reported as being fast. Research on that phenomenon often concludes that the fast-paced production for signers from the coasts could be due to the fast-paced nature of living in large metropolitan areas. That conclusion also supports how the ease with which Southern sign could be caused by the easygoing environment of the South in comparison to that of the coasts.[27]\n\n\nSign production can also vary depending on age and native language. For example, sign production of letters may vary in older signers. Slight differences in finger spelling production can be a signal of age. Additionally, signers who learned American Sign Language as a second language vary in production. For Deaf signers who learned a different sign language before learning American Sign Language, qualities of their native language may show in their ASL production. Some examples of that varied production include fingerspelling towards the body, instead of away from it, and signing certain movement from bottom to top, instead of top to bottom. Hearing people who learn American Sign Language also have noticeable differences in signing production. The most notable production difference of hearing people learning American Sign Language is their rhythm and arm posture.[28]\n\n\n\n### Sign variants[edit]\n\n\nMost popularly, there are variants of the signs for English words such as \"birthday\", \"pizza\", \"Halloween\", \"early\", and \"soon\", just a sample of the most commonly recognized signs with variants based on regional change. The sign for \"school\" is commonly varied between black and white signers; the variants used by black signers are sometimes called Black American Sign Language.[29] Social variation is also found between citation forms and forms used by Deaf gay men for words such as \"pain\" and \"protest\".[30]\n\n\n\n### History and implications[edit]\n\n\nThe prevalence of residential Deaf schools can account for much of the regional variance of signs and sign productions across the United States. Deaf schools often serve students of the state in which the school resides. That limited access to signers from other regions, combined with the residential quality of Deaf Schools promoted specific use of certain sign variants. Native signers did not have much access to signers from other regions during the beginning years of their education. It is hypothesized that because of that seclusion, certain variants of a sign prevailed over others due to the choice of variant used by the student of the school/signers in the community.\n\n\nHowever, American Sign Language does not appear to be vastly varied in comparison to other signed languages. That is because when Deaf education was beginning in the United States, many educators flocked to the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut, whose central location for the first generation of educators in Deaf education to learn American Sign Language allows ASL to be more standardized than its variant.[29]\n\n\n\n## Varieties[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Varieties of American Sign Language\n\nVariants of ABOUT in Canadian ASL\nAbout \u2013 General sign (Canadian ASL)[31]\nAbout \u2013 Atlantic Variation (Canadian ASL)[31]\nAbout \u2013 Ontario Variation (Canadian ASL)[31]\n\nVarieties of ASL are found throughout the world. There is little difficulty in comprehension among the varieties of the United States and Canada.[1]\n\n\n\n\n> Just as there are accents in speech, there are regional accents in sign. People from the South sign slower than people in the North\u2014even people from northern and southern Indiana have different styles.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aWalker, Lou Ann (1987). *A Loss for Words: The Story of Deafness in a Family*. New York: HarperPerennial. p.\u00a031. ISBN\u00a0978-0-06-091425-7.\n> \n\n\nMutual intelligibility among those ASL varieties is high, and the variation is primarily lexical.[1] For example, there are three different words for English *about* in Canadian ASL; the standard way, and two regional variations (Atlantic and Ontario).[31] Variation may also be phonological, meaning that the same sign may be signed in a different way depending on the region. For example, an extremely common type of variation is between the handshapes /1/, /L/, and /5/ in signs with one handshape.[32]\n\n\nThere is also a distinct variety of ASL used by the Black Deaf community.[1] Black ASL evolved as a result of racially segregated schools in some states, which included the residential schools for the deaf.[33]:\u200a4 Black ASL differs from standard ASL in vocabulary, phonology, and some grammatical structure.[1][33]:\u200a4 While African American English (AAE) is generally viewed as more innovating than standard English, Black ASL is more conservative than standard ASL, preserving older forms of many signs.[33]:\u200a4 Black sign language speakers use more two-handed signs than in mainstream ASL, are less likely to show assimilatory lowering of signs produced on the forehead (e.g. KNOW) and use a wider signing space.[33]:\u200a4 Modern Black ASL borrows a number of idioms from AAE; for instance, the AAE idiom \"I feel you\" is calqued into Black ASL.[33]:\u200a10\n\n\nASL is used internationally as a lingua franca, and a number of closely related sign languages derived from ASL are used in many different countries.[1] Even so, there have been varying degrees of divergence from standard ASL in those imported ASL varieties. Bolivian Sign Language is reported to be a dialect of ASL, no more divergent than other acknowledged dialects.[34] On the other hand, it is also known that some imported ASL varieties have diverged to the extent of being separate languages. For example, Malaysian Sign Language, which has ASL origins, is no longer mutually comprehensible with ASL and must be considered its own language.[35] For some imported ASL varieties, such as those used in West Africa, it is still an open question how similar they are to American ASL.[25]:\u200a411\n\n\nWhen communicating with hearing English speakers, ASL-speakers often use what is commonly called Pidgin Signed English (PSE) or 'contact signing', a blend of English structure with ASL vocabulary.[1][36] Various types of PSE exist, ranging from highly English-influenced PSE (practically relexified English) to PSE which is quite close to ASL lexically and grammatically, but may alter some subtle features of ASL grammar.[36] Fingerspelling may be used more often in PSE than it is normally used in ASL.[37] There have been some constructed sign languages, known as Manually Coded English (MCE), which match English grammar exactly and simply replace spoken words with signs; those systems are not considered to be varieties of ASL.[1][36]\n\n\nTactile ASL (TASL) is a variety of ASL used throughout the United States by and with the deaf-blind.[1] It is particularly common among those with Usher's syndrome.[1] It results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often grow up in the Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL.[38] TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, and there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of nonmanual signing.[1]\n\n\nASL changes over time and from generation to generation. The sign for telephone has changed as the shape of phones and the manner of holding them have changed.[39] The development of telephones with screens has also changed ASL, encouraging the use of signs that can be seen on small screens.[39]\n\n\n\n## Stigma[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, the White House published a response to a petition that gained over 37,000 signatures to *officially recognize American Sign Language as a community language and a language of instruction in schools*. The response is titled \"there shouldn't be any stigma about American Sign Language\" and addressed that ASL is a vital language for the Deaf and hard of hearing. Stigmas associated with sign languages and the use of sign for educating children often lead to the absence of sign during periods in children's lives when they can access languages most effectively.[40] Scholars such as Beth S. Benedict advocate not only for bilingualism (using ASL and English training) but also for early childhood intervention for children who are deaf. York University psychologist Ellen Bialystok has also campaigned for bilingualism, arguing that those who are bilingual acquire cognitive skills that may help to prevent dementia later in life.[41]\n\n\nMost children born to deaf parents are hearing.[42]:\u200a192 Known as CODAs (\"Children Of Deaf Adults\"), they are often more culturally Deaf than deaf children, most of whom are born to hearing parents.[42]:\u200a192 Unlike many deaf children, CODAs acquire ASL as well as Deaf cultural values and behaviors from birth.[42]:\u200a192 Such bilingual hearing children may be mistakenly labeled as being \"slow learners\" or as having \"language difficulties\" because of preferential attitudes towards spoken language.[42]:\u200a195\n\n\n\n## Writing systems[edit]\n\n\n![text written in Stokoe notation](image)The ASL phrase \"American Sign Language\", written in Stokoe notation\nAlthough there is no well-established writing system for ASL,[43] written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language seems to be that of Roch-Ambroise Auguste B\u00e9bian, developed in 1825.[44]:\u200a153 However, written sign language remained marginal among the public.[44]:\u200a154 In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text.[45] Stokoe used that system for his 1965 *A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles*.[46]\n\n\n\n![text written in Sutton SignWriting](image)The ASL phrase \"American Sign Language\", written in Sutton SignWriting\nSignWriting, proposed in 1974 by Valerie Sutton,[44]:\u200a154 is the first writing system to gain use among the public and the first writing system for sign languages to be included in the Unicode Standard.[47] SignWriting consists of more than 5000 distinct iconic graphs/glyphs.[44]:\u200a154 Currently, it is in use in many schools for the Deaf, particularly in Brazil, and has been used in International Sign forums with speakers and researchers in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Tunisia, and the United States. Sutton SignWriting has both a printed and an electronically produced form so that persons can use the system anywhere that oral languages are written (personal letters, newspapers, and media, academic research). The systematic examination of the International Sign Writing Alphabet (ISWA) as an equivalent usage structure to the International Phonetic Alphabet for spoken languages has been proposed.[48] According to some researchers, SignWriting is not a phonemic orthography and does not have a one-to-one map from phonological forms to written forms.[44]:\u200a163 That assertion has been disputed, and the process for each country to look at the ISWA and create a phonemic/morphemic assignment of features of each sign language was proposed by researchers Msc. Roberto Cesar Reis da Costa and Madson Barreto in a thesis forum on June 23, 2014.[49] The SignWriting community has an open project on Wikimedia Labs to support the various Wikimedia projects on Wikimedia Incubator[50] and elsewhere involving SignWriting. The ASL Wikipedia request was marked as eligible in 2008[51] and the test ASL Wikipedia has 50 articles written in ASL using SignWriting.\n\n\nThe most widely used transcription system among academics is HamNoSys, developed at the University of Hamburg.[44]:\u200a155 Based on Stokoe Notation, HamNoSys was expanded to about 200 graphs in order to allow transcription of any sign language.[44]:\u200a155 Phonological features are usually indicated with single symbols, though the group of features that make up a handshape is indicated collectively with a symbol.[44]:\u200a155\n\n\nSeveral additional candidates for written ASL have appeared over the years, including SignFont, ASL-phabet, and Si5s.\n\n\n\n![](image)Comparison of ASL writing systems: Sutton SignWriting, Si5s, Stokoe notation, SignFont, and ASLphabet\nFor English-speaking audiences, ASL is often glossed using English words. Such glosses are typically all-capitalized and are arranged in ASL order. For example, the ASL sentence *DOG NOW CHASE>IX=3 CAT*, meaning \"the dog is chasing the cat\", uses NOW to mark ASL progressive aspect and shows ASL verbal inflection for the third person (*>IX=3*). However, glossing is not used to write the language for speakers of ASL.[43]\n\n\n\n## Phonology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American Sign Language phonology\n\nDistinctive features in ASL\n![ASL sign for the number 2](image)\nPhonemic handshape /2/  \n[+ closed thumb][6]:\u200a12\n![ASL sign for the number 3](image)\nPhonemic handshape /3/  \n[\u2212 closed thumb][6]:\u200a12\n\nEach sign in ASL is composed of a number of distinctive components, generally referred to as parameters. A sign may use one hand or both. All signs can be described using the five parameters involved in signed languages, which are handshape, movement, palm orientation, location and nonmanual markers.[6]:\u200a10 Just as phonemes of sound distinguish meaning in spoken languages, those parameters are the phonemes that distinguish meaning in signed languages like ASL.[52] Changing any one of them may change the meaning of a sign, as illustrated by the ASL signs THINK and DISAPPOINTED:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nTHINK[6]:\u200a10\n| Handshape\n | Closed fist with index finger extended\n |\n| Orientation\n | Facing signer's body\n |\n| Location\n | Tip of finger in contact with forehead\n |\n| Movement\n | Unidirectional single contacting movement\n |\n\n | \n\nDISAPPOINTED[6]:\u200a10\n| Handshape\n | (as for THINK)\n |\n| Orientation\n | (as for THINK)\n |\n| Location\n | Tip of finger in contact with chin\n |\n| Movement\n | (as for THINK)\n |\n\n |\n\n\nThere are also meaningful nonmanual signals in ASL,[6]:\u200a49 which may include movement of the eyebrows, the cheeks, the nose, the head, the torso, and the eyes.[6]:\u200a49\n\n\nWilliam Stokoe proposed that such components are analogous to the phonemes of spoken languages.[44]:\u200a601:15[e] There has also been a proposal that they are analogous to classes like place and manner of articulation.[44]:\u200a601:15 As in spoken languages, those phonological units can be split into distinctive features.[6]:\u200a12 For instance, the handshapes /2/ and /3/ are distinguished by the presence or absence of the feature [\u00b1 closed thumb], as illustrated to the right.[6]:\u200a12 ASL has processes of allophony and phonotactic restrictions.[6]:\u200a12,\u200a19 There is ongoing research into whether ASL has an analog of syllables in spoken language.[6]:\u200a1\n\n\n\n## Grammar[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American Sign Language grammar\n\n![two men and a woman signing](image)Two men and a woman signing\n### Morphology[edit]\n\n\nASL has a rich system of verbal inflection, which involves both grammatical aspect: how the action of verbs flows in time\u2014and agreement marking.[6]:\u200a27\u201328 Aspect can be marked by changing the manner of movement of the verb; for example, continuous aspect is marked by incorporating rhythmic, circular movement, while punctual aspect is achieved by modifying the sign so that it has a stationary hand position.[6]:\u200a27\u201328 Verbs may agree with both the subject and the object, and are marked for number and reciprocity.[6]:\u200a28 Reciprocity is indicated by using two one-handed signs; for example, the sign SHOOT, made with an L-shaped handshape with inward movement of the thumb, inflects to SHOOT[reciprocal], articulated by having two L-shaped hands \"shooting\" at each other.[6]:\u200a29\n\n\nASL has a productive system of classifiers, which are used to classify objects and their movement in space.[6]:\u200a26 For example, a rabbit running downhill would use a classifier consisting of a bent V classifier handshape with a downhill-directed path; if the rabbit is hopping, the path is executed with a bouncy manner.[6]:\u200a26 In general, classifiers are composed of a \"classifier handshape\" bound to a \"movement root\".[6]:\u200a26 The classifier handshape represents the object as a whole, incorporating such attributes as surface, depth, and shape, and is usually very iconic.[53] The movement root consists of a path, a direction and a manner.[6]:\u200a26\n\n\nIn linguistics, there are two primary ways of changing the form of a word: derivation and inflection. Derivation involves creating new words by adding something to an existing word, while inflection involves changing the form of a word to convey grammatical information without altering its fundamental meaning or category.\n\n\nFor example, adding the suffix \"-ship\" to the noun \"friend\" creates the new word \"friendship\", which has a different meaning than the original word. Inflection, on the other hand, involves modifying a word's form to indicate grammatical features such as tense, number, gender, person, case, and degree of comparison.\n\n\nIn American Sign Language (ASL), inflection is conveyed through facial expressions, body movements, and other non-manual markers. For instance, to indicate past tense in ASL, one might sign the present tense of a verb (such as \"walk\"), and then add a facial expression and head tilt to signify that the action occurred in the past (i.e., \"walked\").\n\n\nWhile inflection does not change the basic meaning or category of a word, it does provide additional information that helps us better understand how the word is being used in a sentence. This is similar to how subtitles in a movie provide additional information without altering the content of the film itself.\n\n\nAccording to the book Linguistics of American Sign Language, ASL signs have two main components: hold segments and movement segments. Hold segments consist of hand-shape, location, orientation, and non-manual features, while movement segments possess similar features.\n\n\nMorphology is the study of how languages form words by using smaller units to construct larger units. The smallest meaningful unit in a language is known as a \"morpheme\", with some morphemes able to stand alone as independent units (free morphemes), while others must occur with other morphemes (bound morphemes).\n\n\nFor example, the plural \"-s\" and third person \"-s\" in English are bound morphemes. In ASL, the 3 handshape in signs like THREE-WEEKS and THREE-MONTHS are also bound morphemes.\n\n\nAffixes, which are morphemes added to words to create new words or modify their meanings, are part of the derivational process. For example, in English, prefixes like \"re-\" and suffixes like \"-able\" are affixes. In ASL, affixation can be used to modify the sign for CHAIR to indicate different types of chairs. The inflectional process, on the other hand, adds grammatical information to existing units.\n\n\nBy studying morphemes and how they can be combined or modified, linguists gain insight into the underlying structure of language and the creative ways in which it can be used to express meaning. Understanding morphology is essential to understanding how languages are built and how new signs or words can be formed.\n\n\nFurthermore, understanding morphology has practical applications in language learning and teaching. For example, teaching students the basic morphological structures of a language can help them to better understand the language's grammar and syntax, and can also aid in their acquisition of new vocabulary.\n\n\nIn summary, morphology is an essential component of language and provides valuable insights into the structure and function of languages. By understanding the morphological processes involved in language formation, we can gain a deeper understanding of how languages work and how they can be effectively taught and learned.\n\n\n\n#### Fingerspelling[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fingerspelling\n\n![chart of letters in the American manual alphabet, with Latin script equivalents](image)The American manual alphabet and numbers\nASL possesses a set of 26 signs known as the American manual alphabet, which can be used to spell out words from the English language.[54] Such signs make use of the 19 handshapes of ASL. For example, the signs for 'p' and 'k' use the same handshape but different orientations. A common misconception is that ASL consists only of fingerspelling; although such a method (Rochester Method) has been used, it is not ASL.[37]\n\n\nFingerspelling is a form of borrowing, a linguistic process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another.[37] In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent.[37] There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. *O-N* from English 'on', and *A-P-T* from English 'apartment'.[37] Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.[37]\n\n\n\n### Syntax[edit]\n\n\nASL is a subject\u2013verb\u2013object (SVO) language, but various phenomena affect that basic word order.[55] Basic SVO sentences are signed without any pauses:[29]\n\n\n\nFATHER\nLOVE\nCHILD\nFATHER LOVE CHILD\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[29]\n\nHowever, other word orders may also occur since ASL allows the topic of a sentence to be moved to sentence-initial position, a phenomenon known as topicalization.[56] In object\u2013subject\u2013verb (OSV) sentences, the object is topicalized, marked by a forward head-tilt and a pause:[57]\n\n\n\nCHILDtopic,\nFATHER\nLOVE\nCHILDtopic, FATHER LOVE\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[57]\n\nBesides, word orders can be obtained through the phenomenon of subject copy in which the subject is repeated at the end of the sentence, accompanied by head nodding for clarification or emphasis:[29]\n\n\n\nFATHER\nLOVE\nCHILD\nFATHERcopy\nFATHER LOVE CHILD FATHERcopy\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[29]\n\nASL also allows null subject sentences whose subject is implied, rather than stated explicitly. Subjects can be copied even in a null subject sentence, and the subject is then omitted from its original position, yielding a verb\u2013object\u2013subject (VOS) construction:[57]\n\n\n\nLOVE\nCHILD\nFATHERcopy\nLOVE CHILD FATHERcopy\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[57]\n\nTopicalization, accompanied with a null subject and a subject copy, can produce yet another word order, object\u2013verb\u2013subject (OVS).\n\n\n\nCHILDtopic,\nLOVE\nFATHERcopy\nCHILDtopic, LOVE FATHERcopy\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[57]\n\nThose properties of ASL allow it a variety of word orders, leading many to question which is the true, underlying, \"basic\" order. There are several other proposals that attempt to account for the flexibility of word order in ASL. One proposal is that languages like ASL are best described with a topic\u2013comment structure whose words are ordered by their importance in the sentence, rather than by their syntactic properties.[58] Another hypothesis is that ASL exhibits free word order, in which syntax is not encoded in word order but can be encoded by other means such as head nods, eyebrow movement, and body position.[55]\n\n\n\n## Iconicity[edit]\n\n\nCommon misconceptions are that signs are iconically self-explanatory, that they are a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime.[59] In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent because they were originally arbitrary symbols, or their iconicity has been obscured over time.[59] Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way.[60] That may be because the medium of sign, three-dimensional space, naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.[59]\n\n\nIn the era of the influential linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary.[60] Although onomatopoeia is a clear exception, since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic, the Saussurean approach was to treat them as marginal exceptions.[61] ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges that theory.[62]\n\n\nResearch on acquisition of pronouns in ASL has shown that children do not always take advantage of the iconic properties of signs when they interpret their meaning.[63] It has been found that when children acquire the pronoun \"you\", the iconicity of the point (at the child) is often confused, being treated more like a name.[64] That is a similar finding to research in oral languages on pronoun acquisition. It has also been found that iconicity of signs does not affect immediate memory and recall; less iconic signs are remembered just as well as highly-iconic signs.[65]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* American Sign Language grammar\n* American Sign Language literature\n* Baby sign language\n* Bimodal bilingualism\n* Great ape language, of which ASL has been one attempted mode\n* Legal recognition of sign languages\n* Pointing\n* Sign name\n* ASL interpreting\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In particular, Martha's Vineyard Sign Language, Henniker Sign Language, and Sandy River Valley Sign Language were brought to the school by students. They, in turn, appear to have been influenced by early British Sign Language and did not involve input from indigenous Native American sign systems. See Padden (2010:11), Lane, Pillard & French (2000:17), and Johnson & Schembri (2007:68).\n2. **^** The Abb\u00e9 Charles-Michel de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e, founder of the Parisian school Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, was the first to acknowledge that sign language could be used to educate the deaf. An oft-repeated folk tale states that while visiting a parishioner, \u00c9pee met two deaf daughters conversing with each other using LSF. The mother explained that her daughters were being educated privately by means of pictures. \u00c9p\u00e9e is said to have been inspired by those deaf children when he established the first educational institution for the deaf.[18]\n3. **^** Whereas deafness was genetically recessive on Martha's Vineyard, it was dominant in Henniker. On the one hand, this dominance likely aided the development of sign language in Henniker since families would be more likely to have the critical mass of deaf people necessary for the propagation of signing. On the other hand, in Martha's Vineyard the deaf were more likely to have more hearing relatives, which may have fostered a sense of shared identity that led to more inter-group communication than in Henniker.[19]\n4. **^** Although some surveys of smaller scope measure ASL use, such as the California Department of Education recording ASL use in the home when children begin school, ASL use in the general American population has not been directly measured. See Mitchell et al. (2006:1).\n5. **^** Stokoe himself termed them cheremes, but other linguists have referred to them as phonemes. See Bahan (1996:11).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** American Sign Language at *Ethnologue* (25th ed., 2022) ![Closed access icon](image)\n2. **^** Province of Ontario (2007). \"Bill 213: An Act to recognize sign language as an official language in Ontario\".

Although there are not many reliable statistics, it is estimated that there are over 100,000 speakers, 20-30% of whom use it as a second language.\n\n\nFrom a strictly linguistic point of view, Spanish Sign Language refers to a sign language variety employed in an extensive central-interior area of the Iberian Peninsula, having Madrid as a cultural and linguistic epicenter, with other varieties used in regions such as Asturias, Aragon, Murcia, parts of western Andalusia and near the Province of Burgos.[2]\n\n\nMutual intelligibility with the rest of the sign languages used in Spain is generally high due to a highly shared lexicon. However, Catalan Sign Language, Valencian Sign Language as well as the Spanish Sign Language dialects used in eastern Andalusia, Canary Islands, Galicia and Basque Country are the most distinctive lexically (between 10 and 30% difference in the use of nouns, depending on the case). Only the Catalan and Valencian Sign Languages share less than 75% of their vocabulary with the rest of the Spanish dialects, which makes them particularly marked, distinct dialects or even languages separate from Spanish Sign Language, depending on the methods used to determine language versus dialect. Some linguists consider both these and the Spanish Sign language three variants of a polymorphic sign language.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Signed Spanish\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Spanish Sign Language at *Ethnologue* (25th ed., 2022) ![Closed access icon](image)\n2. **^** \u00abUn estudio ling\u00fc\u00edstico: Variaci\u00f3n de las lenguas de signos en Espa\u00f1a\u00bb, Steven Parkhurst y Dianne Parkhurst. *Revista Espa\u00f1ola de Ling\u00fc\u00edstica de Lengua de Signos* (RELLS), Madrid 2001.
