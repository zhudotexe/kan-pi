The list was first published in March 1987.[1] The total net worth of each individual on the list is estimated and is cited in United States dollars, based on their documented assets and accounting for debt and other factors. Royalty and dictators whose wealth comes from their positions are excluded from these lists.[3] This ranking is an index of the wealthiest documented individuals, excluding any ranking of those with wealth that is not able to be completely ascertained.[4]\n\n\nIn 2018, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was ranked at the top for the first time and became the first centibillionaire included in the ranking,[5] surpassing Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who had topped the list 18 of the previous 24 years. In 2022, after topping the list for four years, Bezos was surpassed by Elon Musk.[6] In 2023, Musk was in turn surpassed by French businessman Bernard Arnault, after topping the list for just a year. Arnault became the first French person to top the list.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\nEach year, *Forbes* employs a team of over 50 reporters from a variety of countries to track the activity of the world's wealthiest individuals[7] and sometimes groups or families – who share wealth. Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to *Forbes*, they received three types of responses – some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions.[8] Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets – land, homes, vehicles, artwork, etc. – are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual's holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded stock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual's estimated worth in United States dollars. Since stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual's true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.[7]\n\n\nWhen a living individual has dispersed his or her wealth to immediate family members it is included under a single listing (as a single \"family fortune\") provided that individual (the grantor) is still living. However, if a deceased billionaire's fortune has been dispersed, it will not appear as a single listing, and each recipient will only appear if his or her own total net worth is over a $Billion (his or her net worth will not be combined with family members')[7] Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from these lists.[9]\n\n\n\n## Annual rankings[edit]\n\n\n\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worths listed are snapshots taken at that time. These lists only show the top 10 wealthiest billionaires for each year.\n\n\n\n### Legend[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Icon\n | Description\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Steady](image) | Has not changed from the previous ranking.\n |\n| ![Increase](image) | Has increased from the previous ranking.\n |\n| ![Decrease](image) | Has decreased from the previous ranking.\n |\n\n\n### 2023[edit]\n\n\nIn the 37th annual *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, the list included 2,640 billionaires with a total net wealth of $12.2 trillion, down 28 members and $500 billion from 2022. Over half of the list is less wealthy compared to the previous year, including Elon Musk, who fell from No. 1 to No. 2.[2] The list also marks for the first time a French citizen was in the top position as well as a non-American for the first time since 2013 when the Mexican Carlos Slim Helu was the world's richest person. The list, like in 2022, counted 15 under 30 billionaires with the richest of them being Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz with a net worth of $34.7 billion. The youngest of the lot were Clemente Del Vecchio, heir to the Luxottica fortune shared with his six siblings and stepmother, and Kim Jung-yang, whose fortune lies in Japanese-South Korean gaming giant Nexon, both under-20s.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Name\n | Net worth (USD)\n | Age\n | Nationality | Primary source(s) of wealth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 ![Increase](image) | Bernard Arnault & family | $211 billion ![Increase](image) | 74 | ![](image) France | LVMH |\n| 2 ![Decrease](image) | Elon Musk | $180 billion ![Decrease](image) | 51 | ![](image) United States/![](image) South Africa | Tesla, SpaceX |\n| 3 ![Decrease](image) | Jeff Bezos | $114 billion ![Decrease](image) | 59 | ![](image) United States | Amazon |\n| 4 ![Increase](image) | Larry Ellison | $107 billion ![Increase](image) | 78 | ![](image) United States | Oracle Corporation |\n| 5 ![Steady](image) | Warren Buffett | $106 billion ![Decrease](image) | 92 | ![](image) United States | Berkshire Hathaway |\n| 6 ![Decrease](image) | Bill Gates | $104 billion ![Decrease](image) | 67 | ![](image) United States | Microsoft |\n| 7 ![Increase](image) | Michael Bloomberg | $94.5 billion ![Increase](image) | 81 | ![](image) United States | Bloomberg L.P. |\n| 8 ![Increase](image) | Carlos Slim & family | $93 billion ![Increase](image) | 83 | ![](image) Mexico | Telmex, América Móvil, Grupo Carso |\n| 9 ![Increase](image) | Mukesh Ambani | $83.4 billion ![Decrease](image) | 65 | ![](image) India | Reliance Industries |\n| 10 ![Decrease](image) | Steve Ballmer | $80.7 billion ![Decrease](image) | 67 | ![](image) United States | Microsoft |\n\n\n### 2022[edit]\n\n\nIn the 36th annual *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, the list included 2,668 billionaires with a total net wealth of $12.7 trillion, down 97 members from 2021.[6]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Name\n | Net worth (USD)\n | Age\n | Nationality | Primary source(s) of wealth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 ![Increase](image) | Elon Musk | $219 billion ![Increase](image) | 50 | ![](image) United States/![](image) South Africa | Tesla, SpaceX |\n| 2 ![Decrease](image) | Jeff Bezos | $177 billion ![Decrease](image) | 58 | ![](image) United States | Amazon |\n| 3 ![Steady](image) | Bernard Arnault & family | $158 billion ![Increase](image) | 73 | ![](image) France | LVMH |\n| 4 ![Steady](image) | Bill Gates | $129 billion ![Increase](image) | 66 | ![](image) United States | Microsoft |\n| 5 ![Increase](image) | Warren Buffett | $118 billion ![Increase](image) | 91 | ![](image) United States | Berkshire Hathaway |\n| 6 ![Increase](image) | Larry Page | $111 billion ![Increase](image) | 49 | ![](image) United States | Google |\n| 7 ![Increase](image) | Sergey Brin | $107 billion ![Increase](image) | 48 | ![](image) United States | Google |\n| 8 ![Decrease](image) | Larry Ellison | $106 billion ![Increase](image) | 77 | ![](image) United States | Oracle Corporation |\n| 9 ![Increase](image) | Steve Ballmer | $91.4 billion ![Increase](image) | 66 | ![](image) United States | Microsoft |\n| 10 ![Steady](image) | Mukesh Ambani | $90.7 billion ![Increase](image) | 64 | ![](image) India | Reliance Industries |\n\n\n### 2021[edit]\n\n\nIn the 35th annual *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, the list included 2,755 billionaires with a total net wealth of $13.1 trillion, up 660 members from 2020;

Gates placed second but narrowed the gap from 2011 as Slim's fortune fell $5 billion while Gates' rose $5 billion. Warren Buffett remained in third place. Bernard Arnault of France was the top-ranking European on the list, placing fourth.[34] Ricardo Salinas Pliego was the greatest gainer in terms of dollars, adding $9.2 billion to his fortune and moving up to number 37 overall.[34] Making her debut on the list at age 41, Spanx founder Sara Blakely became the youngest self-made female billionaire ever.[35] Colombia's Alejandro Santo Domingo was the highest-ranked newcomer, inheriting a $9.5 billion stake in Santo Domingo Group from his father.[34] India's Lakshmi Mittal was the largest loser as his fortune dropped from $31.1 billion to $20.7 billion as the price of steelmaker ArcelorMittal fell sharply.[34] As a result, he failed to make the top 10 for the first time since 2004 and lost his title of richest Asian to Hong Kong's Li Ka-shing.[36]\n\n\nA record total of 1,226 people made the 2012 list, representing 58 countries. Of those, 126 were newcomers to the list and 104 were women. The United States had the greatest number of billionaires with 425. Russia had 96 people on the list, while China had 95.[34] Georgia, Morocco, and Peru were newly represented on the list. Falling stock prices in Asia contributed to 117 former billionaires falling from the list worldwide. Twelve others listed in 2011 died. Overall, net gainers (460) barely outnumbered net losers (441).[36]\n\n\nTo coincide with the release of the 2012 list, *Forbes* announced a then-new \"Billionaire Real-Time Ticker\" updating the wealth of the world's top 50 billionaires in real time.[34]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Name\n | Net worth (USD)\n | Age\n | Nationality | Source(s) of wealth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 ![Steady](image) | Carlos Slim & family | $69.0 billion ![Decrease](image) | 72 | ![](image) Mexico | América Móvil, Grupo Carso |\n| 2 ![Steady](image) | Bill Gates | $61.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 56 | ![](image) United States | Microsoft |\n| 3 ![Steady](image) | Warren Buffett | $44.0 billion ![Decrease](image) | 81 | ![](image) United States | Berkshire Hathaway |\n| 4 ![Steady](image) | Bernard Arnault | $41.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 63 | ![](image) France | LVMH Moët Hennessy • Louis Vuitton |\n| 5 ![Increase](image) | Amancio Ortega | $37.5 billion ![Increase](image) | 75 | ![](image) Spain | Inditex Group |\n| 6 ![Decrease](image) | Larry Ellison | $36.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 67 | ![](image) United States | Oracle Corporation |\n| 7 ![Increase](image) | Eike Batista | $30.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 55 | ![](image) Brazil | EBX Group |\n| 8 ![Increase](image) | Stefan Persson | $26.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 64 | ![](image) Sweden | H&M |\n| 9 ![Increase](image) | Li Ka-shing | $25.5 billion ![Increase](image) | 83 | ![](image) Hong Kong | Cheung Kong Holdings |\n| 10 ![Increase](image) | Karl Albrecht | $25.4 billion ![Increase](image) | 92 | ![](image) Germany | Aldi |\n\n\n### 2011[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The World's Billionaires 2011\n\nIn the 25th annual *Forbes* list of global billionaires, Slim added $20.5 billion to his fortune, the most of anyone, and retained his number one ranking with a total fortune of $74 billion. Gates remained in second place with $56 billion, while Warren Buffett was third with $50 billion. The top 10 had a combined wealth of $406 billion, up from $342 billion in 2010.[*citation needed*] According to *Forbes* editor Kerry Dolan, \"media and technology billionaires definitely benefited from a stronger stock market and a growing enthusiasm for all things social\" since the 2010 list.[37] However, Nigerian commodity mogul Aliko Dangote was the greatest gainer on a percentage basis as his fortune increased 557 percent to $13.5 billion. Mark Zuckerberg was one of seven Facebook-related billionaires on the list, as he added $9.5 billion to his net worth to move up to 52nd. Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz was the youngest person on the list. Aged 26, eight days younger than Zuckerberg, he debuted at number 420 with an estimated fortune of $2.7 billion. IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad was the largest loser as he saw his fortune plummet from $23 billion to $6 billion, dropping him from 11th to 162nd overall.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA record 1,210 billionaires made the 2011 list, representing a combined wealth of $4.5 trillion, up from $3.6 trillion the previous year.[38] One third of the world's billionaires, 413, came from the United States. China had the second most billionaires with 115, while Russia was third with 101. Asia moved up to 332 billionaires, passing Europe as a region for the first time since the 1990s.

Slim saw his estimated worth surge $18.5 billion to $53.5 billion as shares of America Movil rose 35 percent. Gates' estimated wealth rose $13 billion to $53 billion, placing him second. Warren Buffett was third with $47 billion.[39] Christy Walton was the highest-ranking woman, placing 12th overall, with an inherited fortune of $22.5 billion.[40] At age 25, Mark Zuckerberg continued to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire.[8] American Isaac Perlmutter was among the newcomers with an estimated fortune of $4 billion largely acquired in his sale of Marvel Entertainment to Disney.[39]\n\n\nA total of 1,011 people made the 2010 list. The United States accounted for 403 billionaires, followed by China with 89 and Russia with 62.[40] It was the first time China, while including Hong Kong, placed second.[39] A total of 55 countries were represented on the 2010 list, including Finland and Pakistan which claimed their first billionaires.[40] Eighty-nine women made the list, but only 14 of them were self-made.[40] The combined net worth of the list was $3.6 trillion, up 50 percent from 2009's $2.4 trillion, while the average net worth was $3.5 billion.[8]\n\n\nThe 2010 list featured 164 re-entries and 97 true newcomers.[8] Asia accounted for more than 100 of the new entrants. Overall, just 12 percent of the list lost wealth since 2009, and 30 people fell off the list. 13 others died.[39] Of the 89 women, 12 were newcomers in 2010. Steve Forbes said the growing number of billionaires was a clear sign that the world's economy was recovering from 2009's global financial crisis.[8]\n\n\nIn June 2010, Gates and Buffett announced the Giving Pledge, a promise to give the majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes. As of 2017, the pledge had 158 signatories, but some of the signatories have since died. Most of the signers of the pledge are billionaires, and their pledges total over $365 billion.[41]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Name\n | Net worth (USD)\n | Age\n | Nationality | Source(s) of wealth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 ![Increase](image) | Carlos Slim & family | $53.5 billion ![Increase](image) | 70 | ![](image) Mexico | América Móvil, Grupo Carso |\n| 2 ![Decrease](image) | Bill Gates | $53.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 54 | ![](image) United States | Microsoft |\n| 3 ![Decrease](image) | Warren Buffett | $47.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 79 | ![](image) United States | Berkshire Hathaway |\n| 4 ![Increase](image) | Mukesh Ambani | $29.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 53 | ![](image) India | Reliance Industries |\n| 5 ![Increase](image) | Lakshmi Mittal | $28.7 billion ![Increase](image) | 60 | ![](image) India | Arcelor Mittal |\n| 6 ![Decrease](image) | Larry Ellison | $28.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 66 | ![](image) United States | Oracle Corporation |\n| 7 ![Increase](image) | Bernard Arnault | $27.5 billion ![Increase](image) | 61 | ![](image) France | LVMH Moët Hennessy • Louis Vuitton |\n| 8 ![Increase](image) | Eike Batista | $27.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 53 | ![](image) Brazil | EBX Group |\n| 9 ![Increase](image) | Amancio Ortega | $25.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 74 | ![](image) Spain | Inditex Group |\n| 10 ![Decrease](image) | Karl Albrecht | $23.5 billion ![Increase](image) | 90 | ![](image) Germany | Aldi Süd |\n\n\n### 2009[edit]\n\n\nIn the wake of the Financial crisis of 2007–2008, the world's billionaires lost $2 trillion in net worth and the list became 30% smaller than the previous year's list.[42]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Name\n | Net worth (USD)\n | Age\n | Nationality | Source(s) of wealth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 ![Increase](image) | Bill Gates | $40.0 billion ![Decrease](image) | 53 | ![](image) United States | Microsoft |\n| 2 ![Decrease](image) | Warren Buffett | $37.0 billion ![Decrease](image) | 78 | ![](image) United States | Berkshire Hathaway |\n| 3 ![Decrease](image) | Carlos Slim | $35.0 billion ![Decrease](image) | 69 | ![](image) Mexico | América Móvil, Grupo Carso |\n| 4 ![Increase](image) | Larry Ellison | $22.5 billion ![Decrease](image) | 64 | ![](image) United States | Oracle Corporation |\n| 5 ![Increase](image) | Ingvar Kamprad | $22.0 billion ![Decrease](image) | 83 | ![](image) Sweden | IKEA |\n| 6 ![Increase](image) | Karl Albrecht | $21.5 billion ![Decrease](image) | 89 | ![](image) Germany | Aldi Süd |\n| 7 ![Decrease](image) | Mukesh Ambani | $19.5 billion ![Decrease](image) | 52 | ![](image) India | Reliance Industries |\n| 8 ![Decrease](image) | Lakshmi Mittal | $19.3 billion ![Decrease](image) | 58 | ![](image) India | Arcelor Mittal |\n| 9 ![Increase](image) | Theo Albrecht | $18.8 billion ![Decrease](image) | 87 | ![](image) Germany | Aldi Nord, Trader Joe's |\n| 10 ![Increase](image) | Amancio Ortega | $18.3 billion ![Decrease](image) | 73 | ![](image) Spain | Inditex Group |\n\n\n### 2008[edit]\n\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, four years after starting the company, joined the list at 23 to become the youngest self-made billionaire.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Name\n | Net worth (USD)\n | Age\n | Nationality | Source(s) of wealth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 ![Increase](image) | Warren Buffett | $62.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 77 | ![](image) United States | Berkshire Hathaway |\n| 2 ![Increase](image) | Carlos Slim | $60.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 68 | ![](image) Mexico | América Móvil, Grupo Carso |\n| 3 ![Decrease](image) | Bill Gates | $58.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 52 | ![](image) United States | Microsoft |\n| 4 ![Increase](image) | Lakshmi Mittal | $45.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 57 | ![](image) India | Arcelor Mittal |\n| 5 ![Increase](image) | Mukesh Ambani | $43.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 51 | ![](image) India | Reliance Industries |\n| 6 ![Increase](image) | Anil Ambani | $42.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 48 | ![](image) India | Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group |\n| 7 ![Decrease](image) | Ingvar Kamprad | $31.0 billion ![Decrease](image) | 81 | ![](image) Sweden | IKEA |\n| 8 ![Increase](image) | Kushal Pal Singh | $30.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 76 | ![](image) India | DLF Group |\n| 9 ![Increase](image) | Oleg Deripaska | $28.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 40 | ![](image) Russia | Rusal |\n| 10 ![Increase](image) |  Karl Albrecht | $27.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 88 | ![](image) Germany | Aldi Süd |\n\n\n### 2007[edit]\n\n\nForbes recorded a then record of 946 billionaires.

However, once the dotcom bubble burst the new rich saw their fortunes disappear.[62] Billionaires' fortunes were hit even harder by the global financial crisis; 2009 was the first time in five years that the world had a net loss in the number of billionaires.[63] The strong performance of the financial markets and global economic recovery have erased financial assets losses. Most of the richest people in the world saw their fortunes soar in the early 2010s.[64][65]\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber and combined net worth of billionaires by year[66]\n| Year\n | Number of billionaires\n | Group's combined net worth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023[2] | 2,640\n | $12.2 trillion\n |\n| 2022[6] | 2,668\n | $12.7 trillion\n |\n| 2021[11] | 2,755\n | $13.1 trillion\n |\n| 2020\n | 2,095\n | $8.0 trillion\n |\n| 2019\n | 2,153\n | $8.7 trillion\n |\n| 2018\n | 2,208\n | $9.1 trillion\n |\n| 2017\n | 2,043\n | $7.7 trillion\n |\n| 2016\n | 1,810\n | $6.5 trillion\n |\n| 2015[18] | 1,826\n | $7.1 trillion\n |\n| 2014[67] | 1,645\n | $6.4 trillion\n |\n| 2013[68] | 1,426\n | $5.4 trillion\n |\n| 2012\n | 1,226\n | $4.6 trillion\n |\n| 2011\n | 1,210\n | $4.5 trillion\n |\n| 2010\n | 1,011\n | $3.6 trillion\n |\n| 2009\n | 793\n | $2.4 trillion\n |\n| 2008\n | 1,125\n | $4.4 trillion\n |\n| 2007\n | 946\n | $3.5 trillion\n |\n| 2006\n | 793\n | $2.6 trillion\n |\n| 2005\n | 691\n | $2.2 trillion\n |\n| 2004\n | 587\n | $1.9 trillion\n |\n| 2003\n | 476\n | $1.4 trillion\n |\n| 2002\n | 497\n | $1.5 trillion\n |\n| 2001\n | 538\n | $1.8 trillion\n |\n| 2000\n | 470\n | $898 billion\n |\n| **Sources:** *Forbes*.[18][67][66][68] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![icon](image)Economics portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n\n\n* Bloomberg Billionaires Index\n* List of centibillionaires\n* List of cities by number of billionaires\n* List of countries by number of billionaires\n* List of wealthiest animals\n* List of wealthiest families\n* List of wealthiest religious organizations\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Specific[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Kollmeyer, Barbara (4 March 2014). \"Bill Gates back on top, WhatsApp founders and more women in Forbes' billionaire rankings\". *Market Watch, The Wall Street Journal*.

The list was first published in March 1987.[1] The total net worth of each individual on the list is estimated and is cited in United States dollars, based on their documented assets and accounting for debt and other factors. Royalty and dictators whose wealth comes from their positions are excluded from these lists.[3] This ranking is an index of the wealthiest documented individuals, excluding any ranking of those with wealth that is not able to be completely ascertained.[4]\n\n\nIn 2018, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was ranked at the top for the first time and became the first centibillionaire included in the ranking,[5] surpassing Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who had topped the list 18 of the previous 24 years. In 2022, after topping the list for four years, Bezos was surpassed by Elon Musk.[6] In 2023, Musk was in turn surpassed by French businessman Bernard Arnault, after topping the list for just a year. Arnault became the first French person to top the list.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\nEach year, *Forbes* employs a team of over 50 reporters from a variety of countries to track the activity of the world's wealthiest individuals[7] and sometimes groups or families – who share wealth. Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to *Forbes*, they received three types of responses – some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions.[8] Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets – land, homes, vehicles, artwork, etc. – are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual's holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded stock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual's estimated worth in United States dollars. Since stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual's true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.[7]\n\n\nWhen a living individual has dispersed his or her wealth to immediate family members it is included under a single listing (as a single \"family fortune\") provided that individual (the grantor) is still living. However, if a deceased billionaire's fortune has been dispersed, it will not appear as a single listing, and each recipient will only appear if his or her own total net worth is over a $Billion (his or her net worth will not be combined with family members')[7] Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from these lists.[9]\n\n\n\n## Annual rankings[edit]\n\n\n\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worths listed are snapshots taken at that time. These lists only show the top 10 wealthiest billionaires for each year.\n\n\n\n### Legend[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Icon\n | Description\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Steady](image) | Has not changed from the previous ranking.\n |\n| ![Increase](image) | Has increased from the previous ranking.\n |\n| ![Decrease](image) | Has decreased from the previous ranking.\n |\n\n\n### 2023[edit]\n\n\nIn the 37th annual *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, the list included 2,640 billionaires with a total net wealth of $12.2 trillion, down 28 members and $500 billion from 2022. Over half of the list is less wealthy compared to the previous year, including Elon Musk, who fell from No. 1 to No. 2.[2] The list also marks for the first time a French citizen was in the top position as well as a non-American for the first time since 2013 when the Mexican Carlos Slim Helu was the world's richest person. The list, like in 2022, counted 15 under 30 billionaires with the richest of them being Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz with a net worth of $34.7 billion. The youngest of the lot were Clemente Del Vecchio, heir to the Luxottica fortune shared with his six siblings and stepmother, and Kim Jung-yang, whose fortune lies in Japanese-South Korean gaming giant Nexon, both under-20s.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Name\n | Net worth (USD)\n | Age\n | Nationality | Primary source(s) of wealth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 ![Increase](image) | Bernard Arnault & family | $211 billion ![Increase](image) | 74 | ![](image) France | LVMH |\n| 2 ![Decrease](image) | Elon Musk | $180 billion ![Decrease](image) | 51 | ![](image) United States/![](image) South Africa | Tesla, SpaceX |\n| 3 ![Decrease](image) | Jeff Bezos | $114 billion ![Decrease](image) | 59 | ![](image) United States | Amazon |\n| 4 ![Increase](image) | Larry Ellison | $107 billion ![Increase](image) | 78 | ![](image) United States | Oracle Corporation |\n| 5 ![Steady](image) | Warren Buffett | $106 billion ![Decrease](image) | 92 | ![](image) United States | Berkshire Hathaway |\n| 6 ![Decrease](image) | Bill Gates | $104 billion ![Decrease](image) | 67 | ![](image) United States | Microsoft |\n| 7 ![Increase](image) | Michael Bloomberg | $94.5 billion ![Increase](image) | 81 | ![](image) United States | Bloomberg L.P. |\n| 8 ![Increase](image) | Carlos Slim & family | $93 billion ![Increase](image) | 83 | ![](image) Mexico | Telmex, América Móvil, Grupo Carso |\n| 9 ![Increase](image) | Mukesh Ambani | $83.4 billion ![Decrease](image) | 65 | ![](image) India | Reliance Industries |\n| 10 ![Decrease](image) | Steve Ballmer | $80.7 billion ![Decrease](image) | 67 | ![](image) United States | Microsoft |\n\n\n### 2022[edit]\n\n\nIn the 36th annual *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, the list included 2,668 billionaires with a total net wealth of $12.7 trillion, down 97 members from 2021.[6]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Name\n | Net worth (USD)\n | Age\n | Nationality | Primary source(s) of wealth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 ![Increase](image) | Elon Musk | $219 billion ![Increase](image) | 50 | ![](image) United States/![](image) South Africa | Tesla, SpaceX |\n| 2 ![Decrease](image) | Jeff Bezos | $177 billion ![Decrease](image) | 58 | ![](image) United States | Amazon |\n| 3 ![Steady](image) | Bernard Arnault & family | $158 billion ![Increase](image) | 73 | ![](image) France | LVMH |\n| 4 ![Steady](image) | Bill Gates | $129 billion ![Increase](image) | 66 | ![](image) United States | Microsoft |\n| 5 ![Increase](image) | Warren Buffett | $118 billion ![Increase](image) | 91 | ![](image) United States | Berkshire Hathaway |\n| 6 ![Increase](image) | Larry Page | $111 billion ![Increase](image) | 49 | ![](image) United States | Google |\n| 7 ![Increase](image) | Sergey Brin | $107 billion ![Increase](image) | 48 | ![](image) United States | Google |\n| 8 ![Decrease](image) | Larry Ellison | $106 billion ![Increase](image) | 77 | ![](image) United States | Oracle Corporation |\n| 9 ![Increase](image) | Steve Ballmer | $91.4 billion ![Increase](image) | 66 | ![](image) United States | Microsoft |\n| 10 ![Steady](image) | Mukesh Ambani | $90.7 billion ![Increase](image) | 64 | ![](image) India | Reliance Industries |\n\n\n### 2021[edit]\n\n\nIn the 35th annual *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, the list included 2,755 billionaires with a total net wealth of $13.1 trillion, up 660 members from 2020;

For the first time, Jeff Bezos was listed as the top billionaire due to Amazon's rising stock price that resulted in one person's biggest one-year gain in wealth ($35 billion) since *Forbes* started tracking in 1987.[15] The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with 585, while China was catching up with 476 when including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan; it had 372 when excluding those three places.[15] Forbes excluded Al-Walid bin Talal and all other Saudi billionaires due to the absence of accurate wealth estimations as a result of the 2017–19 Saudi Arabian purge.[16]\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Name\n | Net worth (USD)\n | Age\n | Nationality | Source(s) of wealth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 ![Increase](image) | Jeff Bezos | $112 billion ![Increase](image) | 54 | ![](image) United States | Amazon |\n| 2 ![Decrease](image) | Bill Gates | $90 billion ![Increase](image) | 62 | ![](image) United States | Microsoft |\n| 3 ![Decrease](image) | Warren Buffett | $84 billion ![Increase](image) | 87 | ![](image) United States | Berkshire Hathaway |\n| 4 ![Increase](image) | Bernard Arnault | $72 billion ![Increase](image) | 69 | ![](image) France | LVMH |\n| 5 ![Steady](image) | Mark Zuckerberg | $71 billion ![Increase](image) | 33 | ![](image) United States | Facebook, Inc. |\n| 6 ![Decrease](image) | Amancio Ortega | $70 billion ![Decrease](image) | 81 | ![](image) Spain | Inditex, Zara |\n| 7 ![Decrease](image) | Carlos Slim | $67.1 billion ![Increase](image) | 78 | ![](image) Mexico | América Móvil, Grupo Carso |\n| 8 ![Steady](image) | Charles Koch | $60 billion ![Increase](image) | 82 | ![](image) United States | Koch Industries |\n| 8 ![Steady](image) | David Koch | $60 billion ![Increase](image) | 77 | ![](image) United States | Koch Industries |\n| 10 ![Decrease](image) | Larry Ellison | $58.5 billion ![Increase](image) | 73 | ![](image) United States | Oracle Corporation |\n\n\n### 2017[edit]\n\n\nOn the 30th anniversary of the *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, for the fourth year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world.[5] In 2017, there was a record of 2,043 people on the list, which is the first time over 2,000 people were listed. This included 195 newcomers of whom 76 were from China and 25 from the U.S.; there were 56 people under 40 and it had a record of 227 women.[17] The number of billionaires increased 13% to 2,043 from 1,810 in 2016; this was the biggest change in over 30 years of tracking billionaires globally.[5] Added together, the total net worth for 2017's billionaires was US$7.67 trillion, up from US$7.1 trillion in 2015.[5][18] This was the first time after 12 years that Carlos Slim was not within the top five. The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 565. China had 319 (not including Hong Kong, Taiwan or Macau), Germany had 114, and India had the fourth most with 101; India reached over 100 billionaires for its first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Name\n | Net worth (USD)\n | Age\n | Nationality | Source(s) of wealth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 ![Steady](image) | Bill Gates | $86.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 61 | ![](image) United States | Microsoft |\n| 2 ![Increase](image) | Warren Buffett | $75.6 billion ![Increase](image) | 86 | ![](image) United States | Berkshire Hathaway |\n| 3 ![Increase](image) | Jeff Bezos | $72.8 billion ![Increase](image) | 53 | ![](image) United States | Amazon |\n| 4 ![Decrease](image) | Amancio Ortega | $71.3 billion ![Increase](image) | 80 | ![](image) Spain | Inditex, Zara |\n| 5 ![Increase](image) | Mark Zuckerberg | $56.0 billion ![Increase](image) | 32 | ![](image) United States | Facebook, Inc. |\n| 6 ![Decrease](image) | Carlos Slim | $54.5 billion ![Increase](image) | 77 | ![](image) Mexico | América Móvil, Grupo Carso |\n| 7 ![Steady](image) | Larry Ellison | $52.2 billion ![Increase](image) | 72 | ![](image) United States | Oracle Corporation |\n| 8 ![Increase](image) | Charles Koch | $48.3 billion ![Increase](image) | 81 | ![](image) United States | Koch Industries |\n| 8 ![Increase](image) | David Koch | $48.3 billion ![Increase](image) | 76 | ![](image) United States | Koch Industries |\n| 10 ![Decrease](image) | Michael Bloomberg | $47.5 billion ![Increase](image) | 75 | ![](image) United States | Bloomberg L.P. |\n\n\n### 2016[edit]\n\n\nFor the third year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world by *Forbes*' 2016 list of the world's billionaires.[19] This is the 17th time that the founder of Microsoft had claimed the top spot. Amancio Ortega rose from last year's position of number four to second.[20] Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway came in third for the second consecutive time,[21] while Mexican telecommunication mogul Carlos Slim slipped from last year's second position to fourth.

However, it was not a good year to be Eike Batista, who fell from seventh to 100th, suffering the largest net loss of anyone on the list.[31] Overall, net gainers outnumbered net losers by 4:1.[32]\n\n\nA record total of 1,426 people made the 2013 list, representing $5.4 trillion of assets.[33] Of those, 442 billionaires hailed from the United States.[31] The Asian-Pacific region had 386 billionaires and Europe 366.

However, once the dotcom bubble burst the new rich saw their fortunes disappear.[62] Billionaires' fortunes were hit even harder by the global financial crisis; 2009 was the first time in five years that the world had a net loss in the number of billionaires.[63] The strong performance of the financial markets and global economic recovery have erased financial assets losses. Most of the richest people in the world saw their fortunes soar in the early 2010s.[64][65]\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber and combined net worth of billionaires by year[66]\n| Year\n | Number of billionaires\n | Group's combined net worth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023[2] | 2,640\n | $12.2 trillion\n |\n| 2022[6] | 2,668\n | $12.7 trillion\n |\n| 2021[11] | 2,755\n | $13.1 trillion\n |\n| 2020\n | 2,095\n | $8.0 trillion\n |\n| 2019\n | 2,153\n | $8.7 trillion\n |\n| 2018\n | 2,208\n | $9.1 trillion\n |\n| 2017\n | 2,043\n | $7.7 trillion\n |\n| 2016\n | 1,810\n | $6.5 trillion\n |\n| 2015[18] | 1,826\n | $7.1 trillion\n |\n| 2014[67] | 1,645\n | $6.4 trillion\n |\n| 2013[68] | 1,426\n | $5.4 trillion\n |\n| 2012\n | 1,226\n | $4.6 trillion\n |\n| 2011\n | 1,210\n | $4.5 trillion\n |\n| 2010\n | 1,011\n | $3.6 trillion\n |\n| 2009\n | 793\n | $2.4 trillion\n |\n| 2008\n | 1,125\n | $4.4 trillion\n |\n| 2007\n | 946\n | $3.5 trillion\n |\n| 2006\n | 793\n | $2.6 trillion\n |\n| 2005\n | 691\n | $2.2 trillion\n |\n| 2004\n | 587\n | $1.9 trillion\n |\n| 2003\n | 476\n | $1.4 trillion\n |\n| 2002\n | 497\n | $1.5 trillion\n |\n| 2001\n | 538\n | $1.8 trillion\n |\n| 2000\n | 470\n | $898 billion\n |\n| **Sources:** *Forbes*.[18][67][66][68] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![icon](image)Economics portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n\n\n* Bloomberg Billionaires Index\n* List of centibillionaires\n* List of cities by number of billionaires\n* List of countries by number of billionaires\n* List of wealthiest animals\n* List of wealthiest families\n* List of wealthiest religious organizations\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Specific[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Kollmeyer, Barbara (4 March 2014). \"Bill Gates back on top, WhatsApp founders and more women in Forbes' billionaire rankings\". *Market Watch, The Wall Street Journal*.
