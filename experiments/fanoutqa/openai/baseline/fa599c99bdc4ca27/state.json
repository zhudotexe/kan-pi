Singaporeans and permanent residents (PRs) enrolled in the approved degree programmes at the university of the arts will pay subsidised fees, comparable to those at autonomous universities here.[18]\n\n\nThe seventh local university of Singapore will be the only publicly-funded private university other than the now defunct and restructured UniSIM in Singapore, and also the only university of the arts with its own degree-conferring power in Singapore slated to open in 2024.[17]\n\n\nConstituent colleges:\n\n\n\n* Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts\n* LASALLE College of the Arts\n\n\n## Defunct universities[edit]\n\n\n* Nanyang University (Merged with the University of Singapore to form the National University of Singapore in 1980.)\n* SIM University (Restructured into the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) and brought under the ambit of the Ministry of Education in 2017.)[19]\n\n\n## Private education institutions[edit]\n\n\nPrivate education institutions (PEIs) are regulated by the Committee for Private Education (CPE).\n\n\n\n### Local campuses of foreign universities[edit]\n\n\nThe following private education institutions are local branches of foreign universities.[20][21][22] Listed alphabetically in the order of country of their origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Origin country\n | University\n | Comments\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Australia | Curtin Singapore | Tertiary education in Australia |\n| Australia | James Cook University Singapore | Tertiary education in Australia |\n| France | \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Sciences Economiques et Commerciales (ESSEC)\n | Education in France |\n| France | INSEAD | Education in France |\n| France | Sorbonne-Assas International Law School\n | Education in France |\n| India | S P Jain School of Global Management | Higher education in India |\n| Germany | German Institute of Science and Technology - TUM Asia | Education in Germany |\n| Switzerland | \u00c9cole h\u00f4teli\u00e8re de Lausanne (EHL)\n | Education in Switzerland |\n| USA | DigiPen Institute of Technology | Higher education in the United States |\n\n\n### External degree programmes[edit]\n\n\nThe following private education institutions offer external degree programmes (EDPs) with undergraduate or graduate degrees conferred by the institutions' partner universities.[22]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Institution | Partner universities\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Amity Global Institute[23] | University of London;

The incumbent deputy prime ministers are Heng Swee Keat and Lawrence Wong, who took office on 1 May 2019 and 13 June 2022 respectively.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe deputy prime minister is the second highest post, and is a senior Cabinet minister in Singapore. Since the mid-1980s, Singapore has had two deputy prime ministers at a time. The holder will sometimes assume the role of acting prime minister when the prime minister is temporarily absent from Singapore.\n\n\nThe office of Deputy Prime Minister dates back to 1959 and it was first appointed by the *Yang di-Pertuan Negara*, when Singapore attained self-governance from the British Empire. \n\n\nThe title of Deputy Prime Minister remained unchanged after the merger with the Federation of Malaya, Sarawak and North Borneo to form Malaysia, while Singapore was a federated state of Malaysia between 1963 and 1965. Toh Chin Chye was the first deputy prime minister of Singapore between 1959 and 1968.\n\n\nHeng Swee Keat was appointed as Minister of Finance and soon after assumed the office as Deputy Prime Minister on 1 May 2019. Both Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam relinquished their positions. Heng Swee Keat was widely believed to be poised to succeed Lee Hsien Loong as the next prime minister following his appointment as Deputy Prime Minister in May 2019. \n\n\nHeng subsequently withdrew himself from the nomination in April 2021 citing age and health reasons and relinquished his finance portfolio.[1][2]\n\n\nLawrence Wong assumed the office as Deputy Prime Minister on 13 June 2022, serving alongside Heng Swee Keat after being appointed as Minister of Finance.

He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Bedok division of East Coast GRC since 2020. \n\n\nHeng had previously served as Minister for Education between 2011 and 2015 and Minister for Finance between 2015 and 2021.[2]\n\n\nPrior to entering politics, Heng worked in the Singapore Police Force (SPF), Ministry of Education (MOE), Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). He was also the principal private secretary to Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew between 1997 and 2001. \n\n\nHe made his political debut in the 2011 general election as part of a five-member PAP team contesting in Tampines GRC and won with 57.22% of the vote. He then elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Tampines Central ward of Tampines GRC and managed to retain his parliamentary seat in the 2015 general election with 72.06% of the vote before switching to contest in East Coast GRC in the 2020 general election.\n\n\nHeng was poised to succeed Lee Hsien Loong as the fourth prime minister of Singapore following his appointment as Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore in May 2019 and First Assistant Secretary-General of the People's Action Party in November 2018. However, Heng subsequently withdrew himself from the nomination in April 2021.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn in a Chinese Singaporean family of Teochew descent, Heng was educated at Raffles Institution before graduating from Christ College at the University of Cambridge in 1983 with a Bachelor of Arts with honours (later promoted to Master of Arts by seniority) degree in economics[1] after being conferred an overseas scholarship from the Singapore Police Force (SPF) in 1980.[4]\n\n\nHe returned to the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and served in various roles,[5] including a five-year stint in the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), before leaving in 1997 with the rank of Assistant Commissioner. He also completed a nine-month Command and Staff Course conducted by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).[6]\n\n\nHe subsequently went on to complete a Master of Public Administration degree at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1993.[1]\n\n\n\n## Civil Service career[edit]\n\n\nHeng joined the Singapore Administrative Service in 1997 and worked at the Ministry of Education (MOE) before being appointed Principal Private Secretary to Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew that same year. In 2001, Heng was appointed Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).[7]\n\n\nFrom 1 June 2005 to 2 April 2011, he served as Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS),[8] and was named Asia-Pacific Central Bank Governor of the Year by *The Banker* in February 2011.[9]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\n### 2011\u20132015[edit]\n\n\nHeng made his political debut in the 2011 general election as part of the five-member PAP team contesting in Tampines GRC, with former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong claiming that Heng had the potential to become a Cabinet minister.[10] The PAP team won with 57.22% of the vote against the National Solidarity Party and Heng became a Member of Parliament representing the Tampines Central ward of Tampines GRC.[11]\n\n\nOn 18 May 2011, Heng was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for Education even though he had just been elected for the first time as a Member of Parliament. In August 2012, he was tasked with leading a new ministerial committee to conduct a broad-based review of the government's policies and direction.[12]\n\n\n\n### 2015\u20132020[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2015 general election, Heng led the five-member PAP team contesting in Tampines GRC and won 72.06% of the vote against the National Solidarity Party. After the general election, on 1 October 2015, Heng relinquished his portfolio as Minister for Education and took up the position of Minister for Finance.[13]\n\n\nOn 19 February 2018, Heng announced during a budget speech in Parliament that the government planned to raise the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 7% to 9% sometime between 2021 and 2025. He said that, \"the GST increase is necessary because even after exploring various options to manage our future expenditures through prudent spending, saving and borrowing for infrastructure, there is still a gap\".[14]\n\n\nOn 1 May 2018, Heng took over the responsibility of assisting Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on the National Research Foundation matters from Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean.[15] Later that year, on 23 November, he replaced Teo as the first assistant secretary-general of the People's Action Party (PAP) following an election in the party's Central Executive Committee (CEC).[16][17]\n\n\nOn 1 May 2019, Heng was appointed Deputy Prime Minister, taking over the office which had previously been shared between Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam. He also continued to hold the Cabinet portfolio of Minister for Finance.[18] From 1985 to 2019, there had always been two Deputy Prime Ministers sitting concurrently in the Cabinet.[18] The unique circumstance of Heng becoming the sole holder of the office, together with his earlier appointment as the party's first assistant secretary-general, was seen by political observers as paving him the way to becoming the next prime minister.[19]\n\n\nOn 30 June 2020, the Nomination Day for the 2020 general election, Heng announced that he would be contesting in East Coast GRC, after Lim Swee Say stepped down as Member of Parliament of East Coast GRC, which had surprising political observers as he had been expected to run for election in Tampines GRC, which he had been representing for two terms since 2011.[20]\n\n\nDuring a campaign speech, Heng unveiled the PAP's manifesto for East Coast GRC residents called \"Together We Care @East Coast\". The plan became popularly known as the \"East Coast Plan\" among Singaporeans and on social media.[21] In the campaigning period, a police report was lodged against Heng after comments he had made during a student forum at Nanyang Technological University in 2019 resurfaced.[22] While responding to a question on the possibility of Singapore having an ethnicity from the non-Chinese community as Prime Minister, Heng had said that the older generation was \"not ready for a prime minister from a minority race\" or someone who was non-Chinese.[23] The police released a statement on 7 July 2020, stating that they had consulted the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) and deemed that Heng's remarks had no intent to wound anyone's racial feelings or promote enmity between different races.[24]\n\n\nOn 10 July 2020, the five-member PAP team led by Heng contesting in East Coast GRC won 53.41% of the vote against the Workers' Party,[25] and Heng was elected as the Member of Parliament representing the Bedok ward of East Coast GRC. He continued to hold his Cabinet appointments as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance after the election.\n\n\nOn 18 February 2020, Heng delivered a budget speech in Parliament when the COVID-19 pandemic had just struck Singapore in January 2020. Referred to as the \"Unity Budget\", the government budget for 2020 covered measures to cover uncertainties long-term against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. On 26 March 2020, Heng delivered a second budget speech announcing an additional S$55 billion \"Resilience Budget\" in response to the worsening situation of the pandemic and to mitigate the economic impact on businesses. It was the second time in Singapore's history since the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 that past reserves had to be used to fund the initiatives provided. Measures include a cash grant of S$9,000 for eligible self-employed persons as well as S$3,000 for lower-income recipients under the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme as emergency relief against the pandemic. Heng also mentioned that this would likely be the worst contraction ever in the economy since 1965.[26] On 27 July 2020, Heng took up an additional Cabinet appointment as Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies.[27]\n\n\nAfter the 2020 general election, Heng had been widely seen as the leading contender to be the next prime minister.[28] However, he withdrew himself from the nomination on 8 April 2021, citing age and health concerns, although political analysts also attributed his withdrawal to the PAP's lower-than-expected result in East Coast GRC at the 2020 general election.[29][30]\n\n\n\n### 2021\u2013present[edit]\n\n\nFollowing a Cabinet reshuffle on 15 May 2021, Heng relinquished his Cabinet portfolio of Minister for Finance, and was succeeded by Lawrence Wong.[31] On 28 May 2021, the Monetary Authority of Singapore announced that Heng had been reappointed as a member of its board for a further term of three years.[32][33]\n\n\nHeng has spoken on the Anti-Indian sentiment of Singapore.[34]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHeng is married to Chang Hwee Nee, the chief executive officer of the National Heritage Board. They have two children.[35][36][37]\n\n\nOn 12 May 2016, Heng collapsed from a stroke during a Cabinet meeting. He was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where he underwent neurosurgery to relieve pressure in his brain. He was transferred to the intensive care unit after the surgery[38][39] and discharged on 25 June 2016. He resumed his duties as a Member of Parliament and Minister for Finance on 22 August 2016.[40]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Public Administration Medal (PPA) (2001)\n* ![](image) Meritorious Service Medal (PJG) (2010)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Heng Swee Keat\".

He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Limbang division of Marsiling\u2013Yew Tee GRC since 2015, and previously the Boon Lay division of West Coast GRC between 2011 and 2015.\n\n\nPrior to entering politics, Wong worked at the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Ministry of Health (MOH). He was Principal Private Secretary to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong between 2005 and 2008. He also served as the chief executive officer of the Energy Market Authority (EMA) between 2009 and 2011.[1]\n\n\nWong made his political debut in the 2011 general election when he contested in West Coast GRC as part of a five-member PAP team and won. Afterwards, he moved constituencies and contested at Marsiling\u2013Yew Tee GRC in the 2015 general election, retaining his seat in the 2020 general election. On the ministerial level, he served as Minister for Culture, Community and Youth between 2012 and 2015, Second Minister of Communications and Information between 2014 and 2015, Minister for National Development between 2015 and 2020,[2] Second Minister of Finance between 2016 and 2021, and Minister for Education between 2020 and 2021.\n\n\nWong was co-chair of a multi-ministerial committee set up by the government in January 2020 to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore.[3] As Minister for Finance, he has overseen the gradual increase in Goods and Services Tax (GST) which Lee's government has advocated for \u2013 8% in 2023 and 9% in 2024, up from 7% which had been set since 2007. In April 2022, he was chosen as the leader of the PAP's fourth generation team, placing him in line as Lee's apparent successor.[4] Wong assumed the office of Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore on 13 June 2022, serving alongside Heng Swee Keat.[5] On 26 November 2022, Wong was appointed to the newly created position of Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Action Party.[6]\n\n\nOn 3 July 2023, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced that Wong will be appointed Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on 8 July 2023. Wong was previously already the Deputy Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) between 2021 and 2023.

He has been a GIC director since Nov 1, 2018, and has also been serving as the chairman of its Investment Strategies Committee since Jul 7 this year after Tharman Shanmugaratnam announced that he would step down to run for the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nWong was born on 18 December 1972 in the eastern part of Singapore.[*citation needed*] He is an ethnic Singaporean Chinese of Hainanese descent[7] and was raised in the Methodist denomination of Christianity.[8] Growing up, Wong and his family lived in a public Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat in Marine Parade.[8] Wong's father worked as a sales executive while his mother was a teacher at his primary school.[8]\n\n\nWong attended Haig Boys' Primary School (now Tanjong Katong Primary School), Tanjong Katong Technical School (now Tanjong Katong Secondary School), and Victoria Junior College before going to college.[9][10]\n\n\nWong received a Bachelor of Science with a major in economics from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1994 under the Public Service Commission scholarship.[11][12] He received a Master of Arts in applied economics from the University of Michigan in 1995 and a Master in Public Administration from Harvard University in 2004.[13][14]\n\n\n\n## Civil service career[edit]\n\n\nWong began his career as an economist working in the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in August 1997.[15] It was the beginning of the 1997 Asian financial crisis and his first assignment involved preparing a report on regional economies and their effects on Singapore; he described the experience as \"nothing that I learned in school prepared me for such an assignment\" and recounted having to learn on the job.[16]\n\n\nHe was posted to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in January 2002 and then the Ministry of Health (MOH) in July 2004, where he served as Director of Healthcare Finance until May 2005. Wong served as the principal private secretary to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong between May 2005 and August 2008.[15]\n\n\nIn September 2008, Wong became deputy chief executive officer of the Energy Market Authority, rising to chief executive officer on 1 January 2009. He relinquished the role on 1 April 2011.[15]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wong with Japanese Minister of Finance Shun'ichi Suzuki in May 2023\nWong entered politics at the 2011 general election when he contested as part of a five-member People's Action Party (PAP) team in West Coast GRC. The PAP team won with 66.66% of the vote against the Reform Party and Wong was elected as the Member of Parliament representing the Boon Lay ward of West Coast GRC.\n\n\nOn 21 May 2011, Wong was appointed Minister of State for Defence and Minister of State for Education. He was also appointed to the board of directors of the Monetary Authority of Singapore on 10 June 2011.[17] On 1 August 2012, he was promoted to Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts and Senior Minister of State for Education. On 1 November 2012, he was appointed Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information.[18]\n\n\nWong led a team to bid for the Singapore Botanic Gardens to be recognised as Singapore's first UNESCO World Heritage Site.[19][20][21] Wong also spearheaded the free museum entry policy for all Singaporeans and permanent residents, to all national museums and heritage institutions from 18 May 2013.[22] In 2013, Wong also announced the setting up of a new S$100 million National Youth Fund for youth to champion community and social causes.[23]\n\n\nOn 1 May 2014, Wong was promoted to Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Communications and Information.[24] He was also a co-opted Member of the 32nd, 33rd and 35th CEC before his win in the election into the 36th PAP Central Executive Committee (CEC).[25] Wong was also appointed as the Head of the SG50 Programme Office that coordinates the work of five committees for Singapore's Golden Jubilee Year celebrations.[26] Wong was also the co-chair for the SG50 Culture and Community Committee.[27]\n\n\nAs Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, Wong was involved in the transformation of the Civic District[28][29]\u2014the birthplace of modern Singapore which contained many institutions that have witnessed important turning points in Singapore's history. In January 2016, he assumed office as Chairman of the PAP Community Foundation from 2016 until 2022 where it was handed over to Minister Josephine Teo[30] In August 2016, the National Arts Council attracted criticisms over the high consultation fees paid for a bin centre, as flagged by the Auditor-General's Office. Wong addressed the issue in Parliament, saying that the project was at acceptable cost due to the need for extensive study of the location and technicality involved with the building of the refuse centre in the Civic District.[31]\n\n\nUnder his charge, Wong also introduced the S$200 million Cultural Matching Fund, a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for cash donations to arts and heritage charities and Institutions of Public Character in Singapore.[32][33][34]\n\n\nIn the 2015 general election, Wong was part of a four-member PAP team contesting in the newly formed Marsiling\u2013Yew Tee GRC.\n[35] The PAP team won with 68.7% of the vote against the Singapore Democratic Party and Wong was elected as the Member of Parliament representing the Limbang ward of Marsiling\u2013Yew Tee GRC.\n\n\nWong was also the Chairman of the Steering Committee for the 2015 Southeast Asian Games.[36] Wong had also announced several key initiatives to get more Singaporeans involved in sports.[37] This includes a national movement called ActiveSG, which gives all Singaporeans and permanent residents ActiveSG$100 to sign up for sports programmes, and enter into swimming pools and gyms at the various sports centres islandwide.[38]\n\n\nWong also chaired the Singapore High Performance Sports Steering Committee, which provides strategic guidance on identifying and nurturing high performing sporting talents.[39] Wong said that the accomplishments of Singapore athletes at the 2015 Southeast Asian Games indicate that Singapore's investment in sports is paying off.[40]\n\n\nOn 1 October 2015, Wong became the Minister for National Development.[14] He also chaired the steering committee for the development of Jurong Lake Gardens.[41]\n\n\nOn 22 August 2016, Wong was appointed Second Minister for Finance,[42] in addition to being Minister for National Development.[43] On 29 August 2016, he stepped down from the board of directors of the Monetary Authority of Singapore and was replaced by Ong Ye Kung.[17][44]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore, Wong and Gan Kim Yong were appointed co-chairs of a multi-ministerial committee formed by the government in January 2020 to manage the situation. On 26 March 2020, while paying tribute to frontline workers helping in Singapore's fight against COVID-19, Wong turned emotional and teary-eyed while delivering his address in Parliament. He thanked healthcare workers, as well as those working in cleaning, transport and security sectors for providing much-needed services to keep Singapore going during this difficult time.[45]\n\n\nIn the 2020 general election, Wong led a four-member PAP team to contest in Marsiling\u2013Yew Tee GRC again. The PAP team won with 63.18% of the vote against the Singapore Democratic Party and Wong retained his seat as the Member of Parliament representing Limbang ward.[46]\n\n\nOn 27 July 2020, following a Cabinet reshuffle, Wong succeeded Ong Ye Kung as Minister for Education.[47] On 8 November that year, Wong was elected into the PAP's Central Executive Committee for the first time after rising to prominence for leading the Government's fight against COVID-19.[48]\n\n\nOn 15 May 2021, following another Cabinet reshuffle, Wong relinquished his portfolio as Minister for Education and became Minister for Finance after Heng relinquished his Cabinet portfolio.[49] On 28 May 2021, he was reappointed to the board of directors of the Monetary Authority of Singapore as deputy chair, replacing Lim Hng Kiang.[50][51]\n\n\nIn February 2022, Wong announced a S$500 million stimulus package due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Wong also said the government would set aside an additional S$560 million to \"help Singaporean citizens deal with the rising cost of living\".[52]\n\n\n\n### Selection as fourth-generation leader[edit]\n\n\nOn 14 April 2022, Wong was selected as the leader of the PAP's fourth-generation (4G) team, succeeding Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, who had stepped down as 4G leader on 8 April 2021.[53] Prior to his appointment, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong delegated former PAP chairman Khaw Boon Wan to initiate a consultation process among the fourth-generation ministers of the Cabinet, aimed at garnering their individual views regarding the selection of a new 4G leader.[54] However, both Prime Minister Lee and Senior Ministers Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Teo Chee Hean, abstained from participating in the process.[55]\n\n\nWong received an \"overwhelming majority\" of support in the consultation process, surpassing that of Ong Ye Kung and Chan Chun Sing, his cabinet colleagues and co-contestants in the 4G leadership race.[56] He received 15 out of the 19 votes from the stakeholders polled, and as no candidate is allowed to vote for himself, this meant that only three other individuals did not vote for him as their first choice.[57] His candidature was unanimously endorsed by the Cabinet and subsequently, by the PAP MPs at a party caucus on 14 April.[58] His appointment was announced by Prime Minister Lee in a Facebook post the same day.[58]\n\n\nAs the new 4G leader, Wong subsequently emerged as Lee's apparent successor to the position of prime minister; the latter's initial plans to step down at the age of 70 had been thwarted by Heng's withdrawal.[59]\n\n\n\n### Deputy Prime Minister[edit]\n\n\nOn 6 June 2022, a Cabinet reshuffle was announced where Lawrence was promoted to Deputy Prime Minister, which further cemented his position as PM Lee Hsien Loong's successor. In addition to becoming Deputy Prime Minister, he was also named \"Acting Prime Minister\" in the PM's absence, he had also taken over responsibility of the Strategy Group in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) from Heng Swee Keat.[60][61] On 28 June 2022, Wong launched the \"Forward Singapore\" movement[62] as part of his vision for a society that \"benefits many, not a few\".[63] The Forward Singapore report was released on 27 October 2023.[64] On 5 November 2023, incumbent Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that he would be passing his ministerial role to Wong in 2024, before the next General Election, \"if all goes well\".[65]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nWong married at the age of 28 but divorced his first wife after three years due to \"incompatibility\".[66][67] He has since married Loo Tze Lui, a former banker currently working in wealth management, and who is also on the board of directors of the YMCA in Singapore.[68][69] His elder brother is an aerospace engineer at DSO National Laboratories.[70]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"MP | Parliament of Singapore\".\n2. **^** Au-Yong, Rachel (29 September 2015). \"Lawrence Wong to lead National Development\". *The Straits Times*.

A member of the governing People's Action Party, he has been the Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Pasir Ris West division of Pasir Ris\u2013Punggol GRC since 2001.\n\n\nA recipient of the President's Scholarship and Singapore Armed Forces Overseas Scholarship, Teo served in the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) between 1972 and 1992, and attained the rank Rear-Admiral (Two-Star). He served as Chief of Navy between 1991 and 1992 before leaving the Navy and entering politics.\n\n\nHe made his political debut in the 1992 by-election in Marine Parade GRC as part of a four-member PAP team. He had served as Deputy Prime Minister between 2009 and 2019, Minister for the Environment between 1995 and 1997, Minister for Education between 1997 and 2003, Minister for Defence between 2003 and 2011 and Minister for Home Affairs between 2011 and 2015. Teo was part of the ministerial committee of the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG). As Senior Minister, Teo had served as acting prime minister in several occasions, during Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's absence.\n\n\nWithin the PAP, Teo was First Assistant Secretary-General in the party's Central Executive Committee (CEC) before he was succeeded by Heng Swee Keat in November 2018.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nTeo was educated at St. Joseph's Institution before he was awarded the President's Scholarship and Singapore Armed Forces Overseas Scholarship in 1973. He graduated from the University of Manchester in 1976 with a Bachelor of Science with first class honours degree in electrical engineering and management science.\n\n\nHe subsequently went on to complete a Master of Science with distinction degree in computing science at Imperial College London in 1977. He also completed a Master of Public Administration degree at Harvard Kennedy School in 1986, where he was named a Littauer Fellow.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Military career[edit]\n\n\nTeo joined in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) in 1972 and was commissioned as a naval officer at the SAFTI Military Institute in 1973. He went on to hold various command and staff appointments in the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) and the Joint Staff before his appointment as Chief of Navy in 1991 with the rank of Rear-Admiral (Two-Star) before leaving the SAF on 7 December 1992 to contest in the 1992 by-elections in Marine Parade GRC.\n\n\n\n### Political career[edit]\n\n\nTeo made his political debut in the 1992 by-elections in Marine Parade GRC as part of a four-member PAP team led by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. After the PAP team won 72.9% of the vote against three opposition parties, Teo was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Joo Chiat ward of Marine Parade GRC. He was subsequently appointed as Minister of State for Finance, Minister of State for Communications and Minister of State for Defence.\n\n\nIn April 1995, Teo was appointed as Senior Minister of State for Defence and Acting Minister for the Environment. In January 1996, he was promoted to full Minister and given the Cabinet portfolios of Minister for the Environment and Second Minister for Defence.\n\n\nTeo switched to contesting in Pasir Ris GRC during the 1997 general election and the four-member PAP team led by him won 70.9% of the vote against the Workers' Party. Teo thus elected as the MP representing the Pasir Ris Loyang ward of Pasir Ris GRC. In subsequent Cabinet reshuffles, he became Minister for Education while continuing to serve as Second Minister for Defence.\n\n\nDuring the 2001 general election, Teo led the five-member PAP team contesting in the newly formed Pasir Ris\u2013Punggol GRC and won an uncontested walkover. After winning the general election, he continued to hold his previous Cabinet portfolios while becoming the MP representing the Pasir Ris West ward of Pasir Ris\u2013Punggol GRC. On 1 August 2003, Teo was appointed as Minister for Defence and Minister-in-charge of the Civil Service.\n\n\nDuring the 2006 general election, Teo led a six-member PAP team to contest in Pasir\u2013Ris Punggol GRC again and won 68.7% of the vote against the Singapore Democratic Alliance. He retained his parliamentary seat and continued holding his Cabinet portfolios. On 1 April 2009, Teo was appointed as one of two Deputy Prime Ministers, in addition to his portfolios as Minister for Defence and Minister-in-charge of the Civil Service.\n\n\nTeo led a six-member PAP team to contest in Pasir\u2013Ris Punggol GRC in the 2011 general election and won 64.79% of the vote against the Singapore Democratic Alliance. On 18 May 2011, Teo relinquished his Cabinet portfolio of Minister for Defence and took up the positions of Minister for Home Affairs and Coordinating Minister for National Security, while concurrently serving as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister-in-charge of the Civil Service.\n\n\nOn 1 May 2019, Teo relinquished his appointment as Deputy Prime Minister to become a Senior Minister, while retaining his position as Coordinating Minister for National Security.[3] In his new role, he also oversaw four departments under the Prime Minister's Office; Smart Nation and Digital Government Group, National Security Coordination Secretariat, National Population and Talent Division, and the National Climate Change Secretariat.[4]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nTeo was married to Chew Poh Yim, who was the director of the business consultancy and part-time marketing management at Nanyang Polytechnic's School of Business Management. Chew graduated from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology in 1977 with a Bachelor of Science with honours degree in biochemistry. In 2015, she founded Stroke Support Station, a volunteering organisation that provides assistance to stroke survivors and caregivers. Chew died on 31 October 2021 at the age of 67.[5] The couple have one son and one daughter.\n\n\nTeo was also President of the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) between 1984 and 2014, and an advisor to the Singapore Dragon Boat Association.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"PMO | Mr TEO Chee Hean\". *Prime Minister's Office Singapore*. 1 September 2020.\n2. **^** PAP appoints Khaw Boon Wan as chairman Archived 3 June 2011 at the Wayback Machine, channelnewsasia.com, 1 June 2011\n3. **^** \"Heng Swee Keat to be promoted to DPM in Cabinet reshuffle\". *Channel NewsAsia*. 23 April 2019.

Prior to his presidency, Tharman served as Senior Minister of Singapore between 2019 and 2023, Coordinating Minister for Social Policies between 2015 and 2023, and Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore between 2011 and 2023.[1]\n\n\nTharman is an economist in roles principally related to economic and social policies. He has also led various international councils and panels simultaneously. Tharman chairs the Board of Trustees of the Group of Thirty, a global council of economic and financial leaders from the public and private sectors and academia. He also co-chairs the Global Commission on the Economics of Water with Ngozi Owonjo-Iweala, Mariana Mazzucato and Johan Rockstr\u00f6m. Its initial recommendations helped shape the outcomes of the UN Water Conference in March 2023. Tharman has also been co-chair of the G20 High Level Independent Panel on Global Financing for Pandemic Preparedness and Response since 2021. In 2017, Tharman was appointed to chair the G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance.\n\n\nA former member of the governing People's Action Party (PAP), he was the Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Taman Jurong division of Jurong GRC between 2001 and 2023. He also served as Deputy Prime Minister between 2011 and 2019, Minister for Finance between 2007 and 2015, Minister for Education between 2003 and 2008. \n\n\nTharman made his political debut in the 2001 general election, and has been re-elected to Parliament four times at subsequent general elections in 2006, 2011, 2015 and 2020. On 8 June 2023, Tharman announced his intention to run for the 2023 presidential election and his scheduled resignation on 7 July 2023 from all his positions in the government and as a member of the PAP, as the presidency is a non-partisan office.[2] On 2 September 2023, Tharman was announced as the winner after receiving 70.40% of the vote in a landslide victory and was elected as the ninth president of Singapore. He is the first presidential candidate not of Chinese descent to win in a contested presidential election in Singapore.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nTharman was born in Singapore in 1957 to a family of Sri Lankan Tamil ancestry. In his youth, Tharman attended the Anglo-Chinese School (ACS)[4] before graduating from the London School of Economics (LSE) with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics. (LSE later awarded him an Honorary Fellowship in 2011).[5]\n\n\nHe subsequently went on to Wolfson College at the University of Cambridge, where he completed a Master of Philosophy degree in economics.[6] He then became a student at the Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University, where he completed a Master in Public Administration (MPA) degree and was a recipient of the Lucius N. Littauer Fellows Award (given to MPA students who demonstrate academic excellence and leadership). \n\n\nTharman was a student activist while studying in the United Kingdom during the 1970s.[7] He originally held socialist beliefs, but his views on economics evolved over the course of his working career.[7]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nTharman started his working career at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), where he became its chief economist.[8] He later joined the Singapore Administrative Service and served in the Ministry of Education as Senior Deputy Secretary for Policy,[9] before returning to the MAS where he eventually became its managing director. He was awarded the Public Administration Medal (Gold) in 1999.[10] He resigned as managing director of the MAS to contest in the 2001 general election as a candidate for the People's Action Party.\n\n\n\n### Official Secrets Act case[edit]\n\n\nWhile serving as director of the Economics Department of the MAS in 1992, Tharman was one of five persons charged under the Official Secrets Act (OSA) in a case involving the publication of Singapore's 1992 second-quarter flash GDP growth projections in the *Business Times* newspaper. The others included the editor, Patrick Daniel, of the *Business Times*.[11]\n\n\nThe OSA case, which lasted over a year, was reported extensively in the Singapore press.[12][13] Tharman contested, and was eventually acquitted of, the charge of communicating the GDP growth flash projections.[14] The District Court then introduced a lesser charge of negligence, as the prosecution's case had been that the figures were seen on a document that he had with him on a table during his meeting with private sector economists together with one of his colleagues.[15] Tharman also contested this lesser charge of negligence, and defended himself on the witness stand for a few days.[16]\n\n\nThe Court nevertheless convicted him and the others in the case.[17] Tharman was fined S$1,500, and the others S$2,000.[17] As there was no finding that he communicated any classified information, the case did not pose any hurdle to his subsequent appointment as the managing director of the MAS, nor to his subsequent larger national responsibilities.\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tharman with Steven Mnuchin in 2017\nTharman made his political debut in the 2001 general election, contesting Jurong GRC as part of a five-member PAP team, and won 79.75% of the vote. Tharman was subsequently appointed Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry and Senior Minister of State for Education. \n\n\nHe was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for Education in 2003, and served in this role until 2008.\n\n\nAfter retaining his parliamentary seat in the 2006 general election, Tharman was appointed Second Minister for Finance (alongside his role as Minister for Education).[18] On 1 December 2007, he was appointed Minister for Finance.[19]\n\n\nFollowing the 2011 general election, Tharman was appointed Deputy Prime Minister, while retaining his portfolio as Minister for Finance. He also served as Minister for Manpower between 2011 and 2012 concurrently. He stepped down as Minister for Finance on 30 September 2015 after 9 years.\n\n\nAt the 2015 general election, Jurong GRC, which was predominantly anchored by Tharman, won 79.28% of the vote against the five-member Singaporeans First team.\n\n\nTharman was elected to the Central Executive Committee of the People's Action Party in December 2002, and was appointed 2nd Assistant Secretary-General in May 2011. After the 2015 general election, Tharman remained Deputy Prime Minister and was also appointed Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies in October 2015.[20]\n\n\nOn 23 April 2019, it was announced that both Tharman and Teo Chee Hean were appointed Senior Ministers effective from 1 May 2019 under a Cabinet reshuffle, relinquishing their Deputy Prime Minister portfolios. Tharman would also be Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and advise the prime minister on economic policies.[21]\n\n\nTharman retained his parliamentary seat in Jurong GRC at the 2020 general election, after winning 74.62% of the vote against the five-member Red Dot United team.\n\n\nIn July 2023, Tharman stepped down from Parliament and all his positions in the government and resigned as a member of the PAP in order to stand as a candidate in the 2023 Singaporean presidential election.\n\n\n\n## Other roles[edit]\n\n\nTharman served as Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) for 12 years from 1 May 2011 until 7 July 2023, when he was succeeded by his deputy, Lawrence Wong.[22][23]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Tharman was appointed Deputy Chairman of GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund. He stepped down as Deputy Chairman of GIC on 7 July 2023. In addition, Tharman also served as Director of GIC between 2004 and 2023, and Chairman of the Investment Strategies Committee (ISC) between 2011 and 2023. On 7 July 2023, Tharman was succeeded by Lawrence Wong as Chairman of the Investment Strategies Committee (ISC).\n\n\nTharman chaired the International Advisory Council (IAC) of the Economic Development Board (EDB) between 2014 and 2023,[24] and the International Academic Advisory Panel that advises the Singapore Government on strategies regarding the university sector.[25] On 8 July 2023, Tharman was succeeded by Lawrence Wong as Chairman of the International Advisory Council (IAC) of the Economic Development Board (EDB).\n\n\n\n### Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs)[edit]\n\n\nTharman chairs the Board of Trustees of the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA),[26] which seeks to uplift educational performance and aspirations in the Indian community in Singapore. He also chairs the Ong Teng Cheong Labour Leadership Institute.\n\n\nHe chairs the National Jobs Council aimed at rebuilding skills and jobs for Singaporeans in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.[27]\n\n\nTharman has led the SkillsFuture programme, launched in 2014 with the aim of developing skills of the future, and opportunities for life-long learning and job upskilling among Singaporeans. He also chaired the tripartite Council for Skills, Innovation and Productivity (CSIP) until May 2017.[28]\n\n\nTharman co-chaired several bilateral committees to promote economic and trade relations between Singapore and other countries, including the Singapore-Liaoning Economic and Trade Council from 2004 to 2008,[29] and the High-Level Russia-Singapore Inter-Governmental Commission from 2011 to 2020.[30]\n\n\n\n## International appointments[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, members of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), the policy advisory committee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), appointed Tharman as its chair where he served until 2014. In announcing Tharman's selection, the IMF said that his \"broad experience, deep knowledge of economic and financial issues, and active engagement with global policy makers will be highly valuable to the IMFC\".[31]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Tharman was appointed by the G20 to chair the G20 Eminent Persons Group (EPG) on Global Financial Governance. In October 2018, the Group proposed reforms[32] for a more effective system of global development finance and for financial stability.\n\n\nOn 1 January 2017, Tharman succeeded Jean-Claude Trichet as Chair of the Group of Thirty, an independent global council of leading economic and financial policy-makers.[33] Tharman was subsequently succeeded by Mark Carney, and was appointed Chairman of the Board of Trustees on 1 January 2023.\n\n\nOn 22 May 2019, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) announced that Tharman will be co-chairing the Advisory Board of the Human Development Report (HDR) 2019 alongside Thomas Piketty. He was reappointed twice, to co-chair the Advisory Board of the Human Development Report 2020 alongside Michael Spence,[34] and the Advisory Board of the Human Development Report 2021/2022 alongside Michele Lamont.[35]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Tharman was appointed a member of the Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum (WEF).[36]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Tharman was appointed by the G20 to co-chair the G20 High Level Independent Panel (HLIP) on Financing the Global Commons for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, alongside Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Lawrence Summers.\n\n\nIn March 2022, Tharman was appointed a member of the United Nations Secretary-General's High\u2011Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism.[37]\n\n\nTharman co-chairs the Global Commission on the Economics of Water with Ngozi Owonjo-Iweala, Mariana Mazzucato and Johan Rockstr\u00f6m. Its initial recommendations helped shape the outcomes of the UN Water Conference in March 2023.[38]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (2023\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n### 2023 presidential bid[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 Singaporean presidential election\n\nOn 8 June 2023, Tharman announced his intention to be a candidate in the 2023 presidential election.[2][39] He resigned from all his positions in the government and as a member of the People's Action Party (PAP) on 7 July in order to stand in the election, as the presidency is a non-partisan office. \n\n\nOn 26 July, Tharman launched his presidential campaign with the campaign slogan \"Respect for All\".[40] On 7 August, he submitted his application for the Certificate of Eligibility (COE) to the Elections Department.[41] He was issued the COE on 18 August by the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC).[42]\n\n\nOn 2 September, Tharman was announced as the winner after receiving 70.41% of the vote, with Ng Kok Song receiving 15.72% and Tan Kin Lian receiving 13.87%, and was elected as the ninth president of Singapore.[43] He is the first non-Chinese presidential candidate to win in a contested presidential election in Singapore.[44] Tharman also garnered the highest vote count in Singapore's presidential electoral history of 70.41%.\n\n\nHe was sworn in on 14 September at a ceremony held at the Istana, succeeding Halimah Yacob.[45]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n### Domestic Honours[edit]\n\n\n* Public Service Medal (PBM)\n* Public Administration Medal (PPA) (1999)\n\n\n* In July 2010, Tharman became the fourth recipient of the Honorary Fellowship of the Economic Society of Singapore,[46] after Goh Keng Swee, Lim Chong Yah, and Goh Chok Tong.\n\n\n* In May 2017, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) conferred its highest award,[47] the Medal of Honour, on Tharman for his varied contributions to the labour movement including \"driving national initiatives to better the lives of workers\" and \"his deep commitment to building an inclusive society\".[48]\n\n\n* In May 2019, Tharman was conferred Honorary Membership of the Singapore Medical Association.[49]\n\n\n### International Honours[edit]\n\n\nTharman was named Finance Minister of the Year 2013 by *Euromoney*,[50] in recognition of the roles he played in the economic restructuring of Singapore and as statesman of the region on the international stage.\n\n\nDuring a working visit in June 2019, Tharman was admitted to the Freedom of the City of London.[51]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Tharman received the Institute of International Finance's inaugural Distinguished Leadership and Service Award,[52] together with Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, for his role as a leading proponent of global reforms to de-risk and grow development finance and to achieve more resilient capital flows.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nTharman is a fourth-generation Singaporean of Sri Lankan Tamil ancestry from the 19th century.[53][54][55] One of three children, Tharman is the son of Emeritus Professor K. Shanmugaratnam,[55] a medical scientist known as the \"father of pathology in Singapore\", who founded the Singapore Cancer Registry and led a number of international organisations related to cancer research and pathology.[56][57][58]\n\n\nTharman is married to Jane Yumiko Ittogi, a Singaporean lawyer of Chinese\u2013Japanese descent. She is actively engaged in social enterprise and the non-profit arts sector in Singapore. The couple have one daughter and three sons together. [59][60]\n\n\nTharman was an active sportsman in his youth, particularly in cricket and hockey, and has highlighted his opinion that sports instils lessons for life. He spoke about sports as a form of education in *Game for Life: 25 Journeys*,[61] published by the Singapore Sports Council in 2013, as \"a huge deal for character... Children learn the value of teams. They learn the discipline of repeated practice, and how there is no other way to develop expertise. Plus, the ability to fall or lose in competition and pick oneself up... with humility.\"\n\n\nIn Singapore's Chinese-language media, Tharman is often referred to as \u5c1a\u8fbe\u66fc (pinyin: *Sh\u00e0ng D\u00e1m\u00e0n*), an approximate transliteration of Tharman Shanmugaratnam.[62] The name was given to him by a leading Chinese language specialist in 1995. Tharman has engaged in Chinese calligraphy since 2002.\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tamil: \u0ba4\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0bae\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bb0\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bae\u0bcd\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"MP | Parliament Of Singapore\".

He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Marine Parade SMC from 1976 to 1988, and Marine Parade GRC from 1988 to 2020.\n\n\nPrior to his appointment as prime minister, he was the country's deputy prime minister, where he advocated for the Medisave, a scheme that allows Singaporeans to set aside part of their income into a Medisave account to meet future medical expenses. Goh also advocated for the Edusave Awards, a monetary reward for students who did well in school based on either their academic achievements or character, to enshrine meritocracy. \n\n\nDuring his tenure as prime minister, political reforms like the introduction of Non-Constituency Members of Parliament (NCMP), to allow more oppositions into Parliament, Group Representation Constituency (GRC), to make sure that the minorities are represented in Parliament and Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP), to have independent opinions in Parliament since all NMPs are non-partisan, were also proposed by Goh when he was serving as Deputy Prime Minister after assuming the responsibility of the government in a carefully managed leadership transition. Goh enacted the Elected President scheme in 1991 as presidents before were appointed by Parliament. He is also introduced the Vehicle Quota Scheme to limit the number of vehicles in the city-state.\n\n\nOn 12 August 2004, Goh was succeeded by Lee Hsien Loong, the eldest son of Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew,[3] and was subsequently appointed as a senior minister in the Cabinet and chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) between 2004 and 2011.[4]\n\n\nHe resigned from the Cabinet in 2011 before stepping down as a Member of Parliament (MP) and retired from politics in 2020.[5] He was given the honorary title Emeritus Senior Minister in 2011 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGoh was born in Singapore on 20 May 1941 to Goh Kah Choon and Quah Kwee Hwa, who hailed from the Minnan region of Fujian province in China. He has Chinese Hokkien ancestry.[6] Goh studied at Raffles Institution from 1955 to 1960. He was a very competitive swimmer in his younger days and was given the nickname \"Bold\".\n\n\nGoh completed a Bachelor of Arts with first class honours degree in economics at the University of Singapore, and a Master of Arts degree in development economics at Williams College in 1967. \n\n\nUpon his graduation, Goh returned to Singapore to work in the government.[7] Goh's dream of getting a PhD was disrupted as the government would not transfer his bursary bond to the university, where he had signed on as a research fellow after graduation. \n\n\nIn 2015, Goh was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by his alma mater, the National University of Singapore, for his contributions to the country.[8]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1969, Goh was seconded to the national shipping company Neptune Orient Lines (NOL) as the company's Planning and Projects Manager. His career advanced quickly and by 1973 he was the Managing Director. At NOL, Goh worked under the company's founder, Muhammad Jalaluddin Sayeed, with whom he maintained close ties.[9]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1976 general election, Goh, then 35, was elected as Member of Parliament for Marine Parade SMC as a People's Action Party (PAP) candidate. He was appointed as a Senior Minister of State. In 1981, he was promoted to Minister for Trade and Industry and later served in other appointments including Minister for Health and Minister for Defence.[10]\n\n\nGoh was tasked to organise the 1981 Anson SMC by-election which was a pivotal event in shaping his political sensibilities. Despite having been passed as first assistant secretary-general by Tony Tan, Goh was surprisedly asked by Lee Kuan Yew to lead and organise the by-election, which was ostensibly because of Goh previous successful campaigns in organising the 1979 by-election at Anson SMC and the 1980 General Elections. \n\n\nEarly on in the campaigning for the 1981 Anson SMC by-election, a chasm of leadership emerged as volunteers and older activists for the previous MP Devan Nair departed along with the MP. The new PAP candidate was Pang Kim Hin, who has difficulties connecting to the ground as he had a reputation of being a \"rich man's son\", being the nephew of Old Guard minister Lim Kan San. Despite being a three-cornered fight, it was apparent that the main opposition candidate was J. B. Jeyaretnam, who was a veteran opposition at the time, having previously came close in winning the seat at Telok Blangah Constituency, which is of close proximity to Anson. The rising costs of housing and upcoming public bus fares was a source of unhappiness among voters. PAP lost the Anson seat with a 37-point swing in just 10 months since the last General Election, marking the first time since Independence that PAP has lost a seat. This watershed event prompted gossip with the PAP that this could signal the end of Goh's political career.[11] While Lee Kuan Yew was worried that Goh may lack the political sensitivity of the ground, as he failed to detect the possible loss of the seat and remained overconfident until very close to Polling day, he did not blame Goh for the loss, as he reflects this incident in his memoir: *From Third World to First*. \n\n\nIn 1985, Goh became Deputy Prime Minister and began to assume the responsibility of the government in a carefully managed leadership transition. According to Lee Kuan Yew, his preferred successor was Tony Tan. However, Goh was selected by the second generation of PAP leaders that included Tony Tan and Ong Teng Cheong; Lee accepted their decision.[7]:\u200a114\u2013116 However, during the 1988 National Day Rally, Lee Kuan Yew publicly discussed his preferred choice of successor to the nation - ranking Goh as number 2 below Tony Tan, and while praising his 'faster mind', criticized his indecisiveness and softer and consultative approach to leadership. This led to Goh feeling humiliated and flabbergasted, as he reflects on this incident in his memoirs, Tall Order: The Goh Chok Tong Story.[11]\n\n\n\n### Prime Minister[edit]\n\n\nOn 28 November 1990, Goh succeeded Lee Kuan Yew and became the second Prime Minister of Singapore. During the first year of Goh's premiership, Lee remained as secretary-general of the PAP.[12] Lee also remained an influential member of Goh's Cabinet, holding the post of Senior Minister. The 1991 general elections, the first electoral test for Goh, led to the party winning 61% of the popular vote which is the all-time low for PAP since independence. Because of the drop in share of the popular vote, and losing an unprecedented four seats in Parliament to the opposition, Goh has to quell rumours about his potential resignation to the international news media. In 1992, Lee handed over the post of Secretary-General of the People's Action Party (PAP) to Goh, successfully completing the leadership transition.[1]\n\n\nGoh's Deputy Prime Ministers: Lee Hsien Loong and Ong Teng Cheong was both diagnosed with cancer in 1992, which prompted the prime minister to call an by-election in his own constituency of Marine Parade in 1992, just over 1 year after the 1991 General Elections, citing the need for 'political self-renewal' and to get 'ministerial calibre' people to join the government. By calling the by-election, Goh became the first Prime Minister of Singapore to vacate his seat to contest a by-election. The vacation also produced a real risk of Goh losing the premiership in the event the PAP lost. Teo Chee Hean, who is currently one of the core leaders of the 3G members of PAP and Senior Minister, was one of the new politicians brought in to contest in the by-election.[*citation needed*]. Fortunately, the PAP retained Marine Parade GRC with 72.9% of the popular vote, allowing Goh to continue on as Prime Minister - which he hold onto for the next decade.\n\n\nAs Prime Minister, Goh promised a more open-minded and consultative style of leadership than that of his predecessor. This greater openness extended also to the socio-economic spheres of life, for instance, in his support for the rise of \"little bohemias\" in Singapore, enclaves where more creativity and entrepreneurship could thrive.[13]\n\n\nGoh's administration introduced several major policies and policy institutions, including:\n\n\n\n* Medisave\n* Non-Constituency Members of Parliament\n* Government Parliamentary Committees\n* Group Representation Constituency\n* Nominated Members of Parliament\n* Vehicle Quota Scheme\n* Elected President\n* Singapore 21\n\n\n![](image)Goh Chok Tong shaking hands with President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev (right) in 1996.\nDuring the period under Goh's administration, Singapore has experienced several crises, such as the aircraft hijack of Singapore Airlines Flight SQ117 in 1991, Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, threats of terrorism in 2001 including Singaporean victims of the 9/11 attacks in New York City by Al-Qaeda and Singapore embassies attack plot by Jemaah Islamiyah, 2001\u20132003 economic recession, 2003 SARS outbreak, and among other events. \n\n\n\n![](image)Goh Chok Tong in 2001.\nGoh's administration whose access to Bill Clinton's White House was blocked because of the Michael Fay incident did not deter Goh from reaching out to the US President to pitch his idea for a free trade agreement (FTA) between Singapore and the US, as he did not believe Clinton to be aware of the diplomatic freeze. With the help of American businessman Joe Ford, Goh managed to reached out to President Clinton during the 1997 APEC summit, where he played golf with Clinton, ending the diplomatic freeze. \n\n\nOn September 1998, Goh had a meeting with Clinton in the White House and agreed to contribute to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization which helped build strong ties between the two countries. The considerable improvement in this bilateral relationship had great impact on Singapore's economic recovery from the Asian Financial Crisis as several trade negotiations, part of \"The Millennium Round\" have failed (1999 Seattle WTO protests and Doha Round) have broken down. As international trade was three times Singapore's GDP at that time, securing trade treaties was paramount to Singapore's economic survival, with the US as its most desired trading partner. By riding on the improved relationship with the Clinton's administration, Goh personally reached out to President Clinton during the annual summit at Brunei in November 2000, near the end of Clinton's second term of his presidency. After a midnight golf session with Clinton after the banquet, Goh successfully convinced Clinton on a Singapore-USA FTA, with Clinton suggesting a FTA similar to the US-Jordan FTA. The FTA with USA was eventually signed in 2003 and this was USA first FTA with an Asian country, with Goh exalting this FTA as the \"crown jewel\" of Singapore's international trade.[14]\n\n\nAs Secretary-General, Goh led the PAP to three general election victories in 1991, 1997, and 2001, in which the party won 61%, 65% and 75% of the votes respectively. After the 2001 general election, Goh indicated that he would step down as Prime Minister after leading the country out of the recession.[7]\n\n\nDuring an interview with *Time* magazine in July 2003, Goh surprised Singaporeans by announcing that his government was openly employing homosexuals, even in sensitive jobs, despite homosexual acts remaining illegal under Section 377A of the Penal Code.[15]\n\n\n\n### Senior Minister[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Goh Chok Tong speaking at a rally at Potong Pasir during the 2006 general election. The banner behind him shows the campaign manifesto of the People's Action Party, \"Staying Together, Moving Ahead\".\nIn October 2003, Goh announced that he would step down when the economy recovered from a downturn that was caused by the SARS.[16] Eventually on 12 August 2004, Goh stepped down as Prime Minister and held a new position as Senior Minister in the Cabinet of his successor, Lee Hsien Loong.[17] On 20 August 2004, Goh assumed the position of Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.[18] After a number of threats of terrorism in Singapore,[*citation needed*] Goh met local Islamic religious leaders in 2004 and made a visit to Iran, where he met Iranian president Mohammad Khatami and visited local mosques.\n\n\nGoh subsequently visited other Middle Eastern countries as Senior Minister, with a view to improving diplomatic relationships and thus gaining wider opportunities for Singaporean businesses, especially in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn 1 February 2005, Goh was appointed an honorary Companion of the Order of Australia, Australia's highest civilian honour, \"for eminent service to Australia-Singapore relations\".[19]\n\n\nOn 19 May 2005, Goh signed a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement with Israel's Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a visit to Israel, superseding the agreement signed in 1971. Improvements in the agreement include enhancements to the withholding tax rate on interest income, which was reduced from 15% to 7%. This would benefit Singaporean businessmen with investments in Israel and vice versa, by ensuring they are not taxed twice.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGoh is a founding patron for the Institute of Policy Studies, a government think tank.[20]\n\n\nIn the 2006 general election, Goh was tasked to help the PAP win back the two opposition wards of Hougang and Potong Pasir.[21] However, he was unsuccessful in this task, as Low Thia Khiang and Chiam See Tong retained their respective wards.\n\n\nIn 2006, Goh was briefly considered for the job of United Nations Secretary-General[22] but he lost out and the job eventually went to Ban Ki-moon.[18]\n\n\nIn 2008, Goh was invited to join the InterAction Council of Former Heads of State and Government, an independent international organisation of former world leaders.\n\n\nOn 24 January 2011, Goh announced that he would continue to seek re-election to Parliament at the 2011 general election. Over the following months, he progressively released snippets prior to the election on the importance of grooming a successor who could be part of the fourth generation PAP leadership to helm Marine Parade GRC in the long run.\n\n\n\n### Emeritus Senior Minister[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 2011 general election in which the opposition made unprecedented gains by winning a group representative constituency in (Aljunied), Goh and Lee Kuan Yew announced that they were retiring from the Cabinet in order to give Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and the rest of his team a clean slate from which they can make a fresh start in the new parliamentary term.[23]\n\n\nOn 18 May 2011, Lee Hsien Loong announced that Goh was to be appointed a senior adviser to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and would be given the honorary title of \"Emeritus Senior Minister\".[24]\n\n\nOn 24 June 2011, Goh was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun by the Japanese government.[25]\n\n\nOn 4 May 2012, Goh was appointed as Patron for Advancement of the Singapore University of Technology and Design.[26]\n\n\nIn 2018, Goh's first volume authorised biography book titled *Tall Order: The Goh Chok Tong Story* was published. It details Goh's life from his childhood to until he took office as Singapore's second prime minister in 1990.[14]\n\n\nIn an interview in 2019, Goh stated that he believed a 75% to 80% majority in Parliament, in the future, would constitute a 'strong mandate' for the Singapore government. In the same interview, he noted that he does not believe the electoral system needed any further tweaking.[27]\n\n\nOn 4 August 2019, Goh made a Facebook post stating that he felt saddened by how his long-time friend, former PAP politician Tan Cheng Bock, had \"lost his way\" by forming a new political party, Progress Singapore Party (PSP), to contest in the next general election.[28]\n\n\nOn 25 June 2020, Goh made a Facebook post announcing his retirement as a Member of Parliament for Marine Parade GRC after 44 years of service and will therefore retire from politics.[29][30]\n\n\nA second volume of his biography titled *Standing Tall: The Goh Chok Tong Years* was released in April 2021 to mark his 80th birthday. The sequel consists of the 14 years which Goh was the Prime Minister of Singapore.[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nOn 2 August 2018, Goh stated that ministerial pay is not enough and it will adversely impact the ability to attract competent people to join the government in the future. He also dismissed the idea of reducing the minister's salary as a populist move, a move that sparked controversy and public disapproval.[31][32]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Goh Jin Hian, the son of Goh, was facing a lawsuit for allegedly breaching director's duties during his tenure as a director of Singapore marine fuel and cargo trader Inter-Pacific Petroleum (IPP).[33]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)\u00a0Malaysia:\n\t+ ![](image)\u00a0Johor:\n\t\t- ![](image) Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Crown of Johor (11 May 1991)[34]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Australia:\n\t+ ![](image) Honorary Companion of the Order of Australia (1 February 2005)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Japan:\n\t+ ![](image) Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun (24 June 2011)[35]\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGoh is married to Tan Choo Leng and they have a son and a daughter, who are twins. Their son, Goh Jin Hian, is a physician and their daughter, Goh Jin Theng, lives in London with her husband.[36]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Goh stated in his Facebook post that he will be undergoing four weeks of radiotherapy following the removal of a lump in his larynx in order to ensure that all cancer cells are eliminated.[37] It was the latest in a series of health scares faced by Goh in recent years.[37]\n\n\nIn 2021, now retired and talking about his health, Goh indicated that he plans to try to live until at least 93 years of age, much like his Malaysian counterpart Mahathir Mohamad.[38]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2014, the Madame Tussauds Singapore museum unveiled a wax figure of Goh. At its opening, Goh posed for pictures with his statue.[39]\n\n\nThe Goh Chok Tong Enable Awards by Mediacorp Enable Fund is named after him.[40]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Jayakumar 2021, p.\u00a0710.\n2. **^** Jayakumar 2021, p.\u00a0712.\n3. **^** \"New prime minister takes office in Singapore\". *NBC News*. 13 August 2004.
