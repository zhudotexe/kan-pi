For example, Chinese and Arabic are sometimes considered single languages, but each includes several mutually unintelligible varieties, and so they are sometimes considered language families instead. Conversely, colloquial registers of Hindi and Urdu are almost completely mutually intelligible, and are sometimes classified as one language, Hindustani. Such rankings should be used with caution, because it is not possible to devise a coherent set of linguistic criteria for distinguishing languages in a dialect continuum.[1]\n\n\nThere is no single criterion for how much knowledge is sufficient to be counted as a second-language speaker.

For example, Chinese and Arabic are sometimes considered single languages, but each includes several mutually unintelligible varieties, and so they are sometimes considered language families instead. Conversely, colloquial registers of Hindi and Urdu are almost completely mutually intelligible, and are sometimes classified as one language, Hindustani. Such rankings should be used with caution, because it is not possible to devise a coherent set of linguistic criteria for distinguishing languages in a dialect continuum.[1]\n\n\nThere is no single criterion for how much knowledge is sufficient to be counted as a second-language speaker. For example, English has about 450 million native speakers but, depending on the criterion chosen, can be said to have as many as two billion speakers.[2]\n\n\nThere are also difficulties in obtaining reliable counts of speakers, which vary over time because of population change and language shift. In some areas, there is no reliable census data, the data is not current, or the census may not record languages spoken, or record them ambiguously. Sometimes speaker populations are exaggerated for political reasons, or speakers of minority languages may be underreported in favor of a national language.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## *Ethnologue* (2023)[edit]\n\n\nThe following languages are listed as having 45 million or more total speakers in the 26th edition of *Ethnologue* published in 2023.[4] Entries identified by *Ethnologue* as macrolanguages (such as Arabic, Persian, Malay, Pashto, Sindhi, and Chinese, encompassing all their respective varieties) are not included in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost spoken languages, *Ethnologue*, 2023\n| Language\n | Family | Branch\n | First-language(L1) speakers\n | Second-language(L2) speakers\n | Total speakers(L1+L2)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English(excl. creole languages)\n | Indo-European | Germanic | 380 million\n | 1.077 billion[5] | 1.456 billion\n |\n| Mandarin Chinese(incl.
