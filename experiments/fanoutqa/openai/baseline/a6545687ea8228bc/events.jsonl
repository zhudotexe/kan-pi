UEFA decided that the opening match would feature Italy if they qualified.[9][112]\n\n\nOf the eleven selected cities and countries, seven cities and six countries had never hosted a European Championship finals match before. Seville was not a venue when Spain hosted the 1964 European Nations' Cup, and none of Azerbaijan, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, Russia or Scotland had hosted the tournament previously. Of the eleven selected stadiums, only two had hosted a European Championship match before: the Stadio Olimpico (1968 and 1980) and the Johan Cruyff Arena (2000). The original Wembley stadium hosted games and the final in UEFA Euro 1996, but although it stood on the same site, this was classified as a different stadium to the current Wembley Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInitially, there were 13 venues chosen for the tournament but two were later dropped. Brussels was dropped in December 2017 after the city's Eurostadium was abandoned,[9] while Dublin was dropped in April 2021 because there was no guarantee that spectators could attend. Spain originally intended to use Bilbao as a host venue but later changed it to Seville to allow for spectators at matches.[10] UEFA chose Stadio Olimpico in Rome to host the opening match between Italy and Turkey, while Wembley Stadium in London was selected as a semi-final and final venue for the second time,[11] following the 1996 tournament at the original stadium of the same name.\n\n\nThe tournament was well received by fans and commentators, with the most goals per game in a European Championship since the introduction of the group stage, and only two goalless games. The refereeing style was also praised, with a conservative use of VAR and quick decisions made on the pitch.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2020 bids\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 13 original venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[111] However, the UEFA Executive Committee removed Brussels as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of Eurostadium. The four matches (three group stage, one round of 16) initially scheduled to be held in Brussels were reallocated to Wembley Stadium in London.[9] On 23 April 2021, UEFA announced that due to a lack of guarantees regarding spectators caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Aviva Stadium in Dublin was removed as a tournament host. Their four matches were reallocated to Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg for the three group stage matches, and Wembley Stadium in London for the round of 16 fixture. Similarly, UEFA reassigned the four matches in Spain elsewhere in the country, with La Cartuja in Seville replacing San Mamés in Bilbao.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 6 December 2012, UEFA announced the tournament would be held in multiple cities across Europe to mark the 60th anniversary of the tournament.[21][22] The selection of the host cities did not guarantee an automatic qualifying berth to the national team of that country. UEFA reasoned that the pan-European staging of the tournament was the logical decision at a time of financial difficulty, such as the European debt crisis.[23][24] Reaction to UEFA's plan was mixed across Europe.[25] Critics cited the expanded format (from 31 matches featuring 16 nations to 51 featuring 24) and its associated additional costs as the decisive factor for only one nation (Turkey) having put forward a serious bid.[26]\n\n\n\n### Bidding venues[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **2020 UEFA European Football Championship**, commonly referred to as **UEFA Euro 2020** (stylised as **UEFA EURO 2020**) or simply **Euro 2020**, was the 16th UEFA European Championship, the quadrennial international men's football championship of Europe organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA).[1] To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the European Championship competition, UEFA president Michel Platini declared that the tournament would be hosted in several nations as a \"romantic\" one-off event, with 11 cities in 11 UEFA countries each providing venues for the tournament, making it the second tournament in the history after the 2007 AFC Asian Cup to have more than two nations co-hosting it.[2] Defending champions Portugal, who won UEFA Euro 2016 in France, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile some countries such as Belgium,[12] Bulgaria and Romania,[13] Germany,[14][15] Hungary and Romania,[16] Ireland, Scotland, and Wales,[17] the Netherlands,[18] and Turkey[19] had already expressed an interest in bidding to host the tournament, then-UEFA president Michel Platini suggested at a press conference on 30 June 2012, a day before the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, that instead of having one host country, or joint hosting by multiple countries, the tournament could be spread over \"12 or 13 cities\" across the continent, as was done for the UEFA European Under-17 Championship's elite round, where each of the seven groups was hosted by a different country.[20]\n\n\n\n### European format decision[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe final list of bids was published by UEFA on 26 April 2014, with a decision on the hosts being made by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 September 2014. There were two bids for the Finals Package (of which one was successful, marked with dark green for semi-finals and final) and 19 bids for the Standard Package (of which 12 were initially successful, marked with light green for quarter-finals and group stage, and yellow for round of 16 and group stage); Brussels, marked with red, were initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 7 December 2017.[27][11][28] Dublin, marked in red, was initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 23 April 2021. On the same day, UEFA also announced the matches in Spain would be moved from Bilbao to Seville.[10]\n\n\n\nSuccessful bid for group stage and round of 16\n\nSuccessful bid for group stage and quarter-finals\n\nSuccessful bid for semi-finals and final.

It included the official kits and player likenesses for all 55 officially licensed UEFA teams. The update also included five out of eleven venues of the tournament, as well as the official match ball.[245][246]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nUEFA had the following sponsorship partners:[247]\n\n\n\n* \"National Team Football Official Sponsors\": Alibaba Group (Alipay brand),[248] Booking Holdings,[249] FedEx,[250] Gazprom,[251] Hisense,[252] and Volkswagen.[253]\n* \"Euro 2020 Official Sponsors\": Coca-Cola,[254] Heineken,[255] Qatar Airways,[256] Takeaway.com,[257] TikTok,[258] and Vivo Mobile.[259]\n* \"Euro 2020 Official Licensees\": Adidas, Hublot, IMG, Konami, and Panini.\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2020 broadcasting rights\n\nThe International Broadcast Centre (IBC) was located at the Expo Haarlemmermeer in Vijfhuizen, Netherlands.[260]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUEFA announced the original tournament schedule on 24 May 2018, which only included kick-off times for the opening match and quarter-finals onward.[150][151] The kick-off times of the remaining group stage and round of 16 matches were announced on 30 November 2019 following the final draw.[152] On 17 June 2020, UEFA announced the revised match schedule for the tournament in 2021.[153][154] All match dates, kick-off times and venues remained identical, but shifted one day earlier so matches would remain on the same day of the week (i.e. from 12 to 11 June for the opening match to remain on a Friday). On 23 April 2021, UEFA revised the venue assignments of the match schedule after one stadium was removed from the tournament and another was replaced.[155]\n\n\nGroup winners, runners-up, and the best four third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16.\n\n\n*Times are CEST (UTC+2), as listed by UEFA. If the venue was located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe draw for the final tournament was held on 30 November 2019, 18:00 CET (19:00 local time, EET) at Romexpo in Bucharest, Romania.[134][135][136][106] The 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four. The identity of the four play-off teams were not known at the time of the draw and were identified as play-off winners A to D.[137] Should there have been groups that could not be finalised at the time of the final tournament draw, another draw would have been held after the play-offs on 1 April 2020,[1] but UEFA confirmed the additional draw was not necessary after the identity of the 20 directly qualified teams and the 16 play-offs teams was known.[115]\n\n\nThe teams were seeded in accordance with the European Qualifiers overall ranking based on their results in UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying.

UEFA decided that the opening match would feature Italy if they qualified.[9][112]\n\n\nOf the eleven selected cities and countries, seven cities and six countries had never hosted a European Championship finals match before. Seville was not a venue when Spain hosted the 1964 European Nations' Cup, and none of Azerbaijan, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, Russia or Scotland had hosted the tournament previously. Of the eleven selected stadiums, only two had hosted a European Championship match before: the Stadio Olimpico (1968 and 1980) and the Johan Cruyff Arena (2000). The original Wembley stadium hosted games and the final in UEFA Euro 1996, but although it stood on the same site, this was classified as a different stadium to the current Wembley Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInitially, there were 13 venues chosen for the tournament but two were later dropped. Brussels was dropped in December 2017 after the city's Eurostadium was abandoned,[9] while Dublin was dropped in April 2021 because there was no guarantee that spectators could attend. Spain originally intended to use Bilbao as a host venue but later changed it to Seville to allow for spectators at matches.[10] UEFA chose Stadio Olimpico in Rome to host the opening match between Italy and Turkey, while Wembley Stadium in London was selected as a semi-final and final venue for the second time,[11] following the 1996 tournament at the original stadium of the same name.\n\n\nThe tournament was well received by fans and commentators, with the most goals per game in a European Championship since the introduction of the group stage, and only two goalless games. The refereeing style was also praised, with a conservative use of VAR and quick decisions made on the pitch.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2020 bids\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 13 original venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[111] However, the UEFA Executive Committee removed Brussels as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of Eurostadium. The four matches (three group stage, one round of 16) initially scheduled to be held in Brussels were reallocated to Wembley Stadium in London.[9] On 23 April 2021, UEFA announced that due to a lack of guarantees regarding spectators caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Aviva Stadium in Dublin was removed as a tournament host. Their four matches were reallocated to Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg for the three group stage matches, and Wembley Stadium in London for the round of 16 fixture. Similarly, UEFA reassigned the four matches in Spain elsewhere in the country, with La Cartuja in Seville replacing San Mamés in Bilbao.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 6 December 2012, UEFA announced the tournament would be held in multiple cities across Europe to mark the 60th anniversary of the tournament.[21][22] The selection of the host cities did not guarantee an automatic qualifying berth to the national team of that country. UEFA reasoned that the pan-European staging of the tournament was the logical decision at a time of financial difficulty, such as the European debt crisis.[23][24] Reaction to UEFA's plan was mixed across Europe.[25] Critics cited the expanded format (from 31 matches featuring 16 nations to 51 featuring 24) and its associated additional costs as the decisive factor for only one nation (Turkey) having put forward a serious bid.[26]\n\n\n\n### Bidding venues[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **2020 UEFA European Football Championship**, commonly referred to as **UEFA Euro 2020** (stylised as **UEFA EURO 2020**) or simply **Euro 2020**, was the 16th UEFA European Championship, the quadrennial international men's football championship of Europe organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA).[1] To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the European Championship competition, UEFA president Michel Platini declared that the tournament would be hosted in several nations as a \"romantic\" one-off event, with 11 cities in 11 UEFA countries each providing venues for the tournament, making it the second tournament in the history after the 2007 AFC Asian Cup to have more than two nations co-hosting it.[2] Defending champions Portugal, who won UEFA Euro 2016 in France, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile some countries such as Belgium,[12] Bulgaria and Romania,[13] Germany,[14][15] Hungary and Romania,[16] Ireland, Scotland, and Wales,[17] the Netherlands,[18] and Turkey[19] had already expressed an interest in bidding to host the tournament, then-UEFA president Michel Platini suggested at a press conference on 30 June 2012, a day before the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, that instead of having one host country, or joint hosting by multiple countries, the tournament could be spread over \"12 or 13 cities\" across the continent, as was done for the UEFA European Under-17 Championship's elite round, where each of the seven groups was hosted by a different country.[20]\n\n\n\n### European format decision[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe final list of bids was published by UEFA on 26 April 2014, with a decision on the hosts being made by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 September 2014. There were two bids for the Finals Package (of which one was successful, marked with dark green for semi-finals and final) and 19 bids for the Standard Package (of which 12 were initially successful, marked with light green for quarter-finals and group stage, and yellow for round of 16 and group stage); Brussels, marked with red, were initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 7 December 2017.[27][11][28] Dublin, marked in red, was initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 23 April 2021. On the same day, UEFA also announced the matches in Spain would be moved from Bilbao to Seville.[10]\n\n\n\nSuccessful bid for group stage and round of 16\n\nSuccessful bid for group stage and quarter-finals\n\nSuccessful bid for semi-finals and final.

Every host must guarantee there will be fans at their games.\" UEFA subsequently stated that no host city would be automatically dropped should they decide to play matches behind closed doors. However, UEFA would need to consider whether it would make sense to play matches without spectators, or if these matches should be reallocated to other venues.[56] That same month, British prime minister Boris Johnson offered UEFA to host additional tournament matches in England should any venues need to be reassigned.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** \"Executive Committee approves guidelines on eligibility for participation in UEFA competitions\". *UEFA.com*.

Then, in December 2011, Nancy announced its withdrawal from the tournament, after plans for the stadium's renovation were cancelled,[38] finalising the list of host venues at ten.\n\n\nTwo other possible options, the Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes and the Stade de la Mosson in Montpellier (venues which were used for the 1998 World Cup) were not chosen. The final list was confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee on 25 January 2013.[39] Capacity figures are those for matches at UEFA Euro 2016 and are not necessarily the total capacity that the venues are capable of holding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"National Team Coefficients Overview 2015\" (PDF).

It was the third time that France hosted the finals, after the inaugural tournament in 1960 and the 1984 finals.\n\n\nAs the winners, Portugal earned the right to compete at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 bids\n\nFour bids came before the deadline on 9 March 2009. France, Italy and Turkey put in single bids while Norway and Sweden put in a joint bid.[10] Norway and Sweden eventually withdrew their bid in December 2009.[11]\n\n\nThe host was selected on 28 May 2010.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to 2016 UEFA European Championship.\n\n* UEFA Euro 2016 at UEFA.com\n* Official Technical Report\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2016\n |\n| --- |\n| Stages | * Qualification\n* Group stage\n\t+ Group A\n\t+ Group B\n\t+ Group C\n\t+ Group D\n\t+ Group E\n\t+ Group F\n* Knockout phase\n* Final\n |\n| General information | * Bids\n* Broadcasting\n* Squads\n* Statistics\n* Riots\n |\n| Official symbols | * Beau Jeu (group stage ball)\n* Fracas (knockout phase ball)\n* Super Victor (mascot)\n* *Pro Evolution Soccer: UEFA Euro 2016 France* (video game)\n* \"This One's for You\" (song)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2016 finalists\n |\n| --- |\n| Champions | * **Portugal**\n |\n| Runners-up | * France\n |\n| Eliminated in the semi-finals | * Germany\n* Wales\n |\n| Eliminated in the quarter-finals | * Belgium\n* Iceland\n* Italy\n* Poland\n |\n| Eliminated in the round of 16 | * Croatia\n* England\n* Hungary\n* Northern Ireland\n* Republic of Ireland\n* Slovakia\n* Spain\n* Switzerland\n |\n| Eliminated in the group stage | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTen stadiums were used for the competition. Initially, twelve stadiums were presented for the French bid, chosen on 28 May 2010. These venues were to be whittled down to nine by the end of May 2011, but it was suggested in June 2011 that eleven venues might be used.[33][34] The French Football Federation had to choose which nine would actually be used.\n\n\nThe choice for the first seven was undisputed – the national Stade de France, four newly constructed ones in Lille Metropole (Villeneuve-d'Ascq), Décines-Charpieu (Lyon Metropolis), Nice and Bordeaux, and two stadiums in the two largest cities, Paris and Marseille. After Strasbourg opted out for financial reasons following relegation,[35] two more venues were selected to be Lens and Nancy, leaving Saint-Étienne and Toulouse as reserve options.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRomania, Turkey, Austria and Switzerland all returned after missing out in 2012, with the Austrians qualifying for just their second final Euro tournament, after having co-hosted Euro 2008.[22] Returning to the final tournament after long absences were Belgium for the first time since co-hosting Euro 2000, and Hungary for the first time in 44 years, having last appeared at Euro 1972, and 30 years since appearing in a major tournament, their previous one being the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nFive teams secured their first qualification to a UEFA European Championship final tournament: Albania, Iceland, Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Wales.[22] Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Wales had each previously competed in the FIFA World Cup, while Albania and Iceland had never participated in a major tournament.[22] Similarly, both Austria and Ukraine completed successful qualification campaigns for the first time, having only previously qualified as hosts (of 2008 and 2012 respectively).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Eccleshare, Charlie (12 October 2015). \"Euro 2016: How will England, Wales, Northern Ireland and possibly Republic of Ireland fare in France?\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

The first time was the St. Jakob-Park in Basel during Euro 2008.[138]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n53 teams competed for 23 places in the final tournament to join France, who automatically qualified as hosts.

The group winners, runners-up, and the best third-placed team (with the results against the sixth-placed team discarded) qualify directly for the final tournament. The remaining eight third-placed teams contested two-legged play-offs to determine the last four qualifiers.[14][15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n141. **^** \"UEFA orders Euro 2016 stadium pitch relaid\". *New Vision*.

The remaining teams were seeded into four pots of five (Pot 1) or six teams (Pots 2, 3 and 4). As the title holders, Spain were seeded in Pot 1, while the other 22 teams were seeded according to the UEFA national team coefficients updated after the completion of the qualifying group stage (excluding the play-offs), which were released by UEFA on 14 October 2015.[29][30][31][32]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the first time, the European Championship final tournament was contested by 24 teams, having been expanded from the 16-team format used since 1996.[6] Under the new format, the finalists contested a group stage consisting of six groups of four teams, followed by a knockout phase including three rounds and the final. Nineteen teams – the top two from each of the nine qualifying groups and the best third-placed team – joined France in the final tournament, who qualified automatically as host; a series of two-legged play-off ties between the remaining third-placed teams in November 2015 decided the last four finalist spots.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Overall records | * Team appearances\n* Player appearances\n* Goalscorers\n\t+ Hat-tricks\n\t+ Own goals\n* Penalty shoot-outs\n* Red cards\n* Winning players\n* Winning managers\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Awards\n* Music\n* Mascots\n* Balls\n* Video games\n |\n| * † *Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe*\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Gibraltar\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland '15 '16\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan '15 '16\n* Kosovo\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania '15–'16 '16\n* Luxembourg\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Norway '15 '16\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '15 '16\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Scotland\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* Wales\n |\n| League cups | * England\n* Finland '15 '16\n* France\n* Iceland '15 '16\n* Israel\n* Latvia\n* Northern Ireland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '15 '16\n* Romania\n* Scotland\n* Wales\n |\n| Supercups | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Bulgaria\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* England\n* Estonia '15 '16\n* Faroe Islands\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Gibraltar\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan\n* Lithuania\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '15 '16\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** \"Euro 2016 opening ceremony: can-can girls, giant dancing lips, ballet and... lollipops?\". *www.telegraph.co.uk*.

UEFA's general secretary Gianni Infantino previously described the format as \"not ideal\" due to the need for third-ranked teams in the group stage advancing, leading to difficulty in preventing situations where teams might be able to know in advance what results they needed to progress out of the group; this led to the risk of a lack of suspense for fans, or even the prospect of mutually beneficial collusion between teams.[17]\n\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom had to be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament.[42] If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he could be replaced by another player.[16]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n149. **^** \"UEFA EURO 2016 logo unveiled\".

It was the third time that France hosted the finals, after the inaugural tournament in 1960 and the 1984 finals.\n\n\nAs the winners, Portugal earned the right to compete at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 bids\n\nFour bids came before the deadline on 9 March 2009. France, Italy and Turkey put in single bids while Norway and Sweden put in a joint bid.[10] Norway and Sweden eventually withdrew their bid in December 2009.[11]\n\n\nThe host was selected on 28 May 2010.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to 2016 UEFA European Championship.\n\n* UEFA Euro 2016 at UEFA.com\n* Official Technical Report\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2016\n |\n| --- |\n| Stages | * Qualification\n* Group stage\n\t+ Group A\n\t+ Group B\n\t+ Group C\n\t+ Group D\n\t+ Group E\n\t+ Group F\n* Knockout phase\n* Final\n |\n| General information | * Bids\n* Broadcasting\n* Squads\n* Statistics\n* Riots\n |\n| Official symbols | * Beau Jeu (group stage ball)\n* Fracas (knockout phase ball)\n* Super Victor (mascot)\n* *Pro Evolution Soccer: UEFA Euro 2016 France* (video game)\n* \"This One's for You\" (song)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2016 finalists\n |\n| --- |\n| Champions | * **Portugal**\n |\n| Runners-up | * France\n |\n| Eliminated in the semi-finals | * Germany\n* Wales\n |\n| Eliminated in the quarter-finals | * Belgium\n* Iceland\n* Italy\n* Poland\n |\n| Eliminated in the round of 16 | * Croatia\n* England\n* Hungary\n* Northern Ireland\n* Republic of Ireland\n* Slovakia\n* Spain\n* Switzerland\n |\n| Eliminated in the group stage | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTen stadiums were used for the competition. Initially, twelve stadiums were presented for the French bid, chosen on 28 May 2010. These venues were to be whittled down to nine by the end of May 2011, but it was suggested in June 2011 that eleven venues might be used.[33][34] The French Football Federation had to choose which nine would actually be used.\n\n\nThe choice for the first seven was undisputed – the national Stade de France, four newly constructed ones in Lille Metropole (Villeneuve-d'Ascq), Décines-Charpieu (Lyon Metropolis), Nice and Bordeaux, and two stadiums in the two largest cities, Paris and Marseille. After Strasbourg opted out for financial reasons following relegation,[35] two more venues were selected to be Lens and Nancy, leaving Saint-Étienne and Toulouse as reserve options.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRomania, Turkey, Austria and Switzerland all returned after missing out in 2012, with the Austrians qualifying for just their second final Euro tournament, after having co-hosted Euro 2008.[22] Returning to the final tournament after long absences were Belgium for the first time since co-hosting Euro 2000, and Hungary for the first time in 44 years, having last appeared at Euro 1972, and 30 years since appearing in a major tournament, their previous one being the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nFive teams secured their first qualification to a UEFA European Championship final tournament: Albania, Iceland, Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Wales.[22] Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Wales had each previously competed in the FIFA World Cup, while Albania and Iceland had never participated in a major tournament.[22] Similarly, both Austria and Ukraine completed successful qualification campaigns for the first time, having only previously qualified as hosts (of 2008 and 2012 respectively).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Eccleshare, Charlie (12 October 2015). \"Euro 2016: How will England, Wales, Northern Ireland and possibly Republic of Ireland fare in France?\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

The first time was the St. Jakob-Park in Basel during Euro 2008.[138]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n53 teams competed for 23 places in the final tournament to join France, who automatically qualified as hosts.

The group winners, runners-up, and the best third-placed team (with the results against the sixth-placed team discarded) qualify directly for the final tournament.

The remaining teams were seeded into four pots of five (Pot 1) or six teams (Pots 2, 3 and 4). As the title holders, Spain were seeded in Pot 1, while the other 22 teams were seeded according to the UEFA national team coefficients updated after the completion of the qualifying group stage (excluding the play-offs), which were released by UEFA on 14 October 2015.[29][30][31][32]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the first time, the European Championship final tournament was contested by 24 teams, having been expanded from the 16-team format used since 1996.[6] Under the new format, the finalists contested a group stage consisting of six groups of four teams, followed by a knockout phase including three rounds and the final. Nineteen teams – the top two from each of the nine qualifying groups and the best third-placed team – joined France in the final tournament, who qualified automatically as host; a series of two-legged play-off ties between the remaining third-placed teams in November 2015 decided the last four finalist spots.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Overall records | * Team appearances\n* Player appearances\n* Goalscorers\n\t+ Hat-tricks\n\t+ Own goals\n* Penalty shoot-outs\n* Red cards\n* Winning players\n* Winning managers\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Awards\n* Music\n* Mascots\n* Balls\n* Video games\n |\n| * † *Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe*\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Gibraltar\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland '15 '16\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan '15 '16\n* Kosovo\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania '15–'16 '16\n* Luxembourg\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Norway '15 '16\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '15 '16\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Scotland\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* Wales\n |\n| League cups | * England\n* Finland '15 '16\n* France\n* Iceland '15 '16\n* Israel\n* Latvia\n* Northern Ireland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '15 '16\n* Romania\n* Scotland\n* Wales\n |\n| Supercups | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Bulgaria\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* England\n* Estonia '15 '16\n* Faroe Islands\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Gibraltar\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan\n* Lithuania\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '15 '16\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** \"Euro 2016 opening ceremony: can-can girls, giant dancing lips, ballet and... lollipops?\". *www.telegraph.co.uk*.

UEFA's general secretary Gianni Infantino previously described the format as \"not ideal\" due to the need for third-ranked teams in the group stage advancing, leading to difficulty in preventing situations where teams might be able to know in advance what results they needed to progress out of the group; this led to the risk of a lack of suspense for fans, or even the prospect of mutually beneficial collusion between teams.[17]\n\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom had to be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament.[42] If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he could be replaced by another player.[16]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n149. **^** \"UEFA EURO 2016 logo unveiled\".

In a return to the format used at Euro 1992, Euro 1996 and Euro 2008, each of the four groups' matches were played in two stadiums. Host cities Warsaw, Gdańsk, Wrocław, Poznań, Kyiv, and Lviv are all popular tourist destinations, unlike Donetsk and Kharkiv, the latter of which replaced Dnipropetrovsk as a host city in 2009.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2012 stadiums\n |\n| --- |\n| Poland | * National Stadium (Warsaw)\n* Gdańsk Stadium (Gdańsk)\n* Wrocław Stadium (Wrocław)\n* Poznań Stadium (Poznań)\n |\n| Ukraine | * NSC Olimpiyskiy (Kyiv)\n* Donbass Arena (Donetsk)\n* Metalist Stadium (Kharkiv)\n* Arena Lviv (Lviv)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn order to meet UEFA's requirement for football infrastructure improvements, five new stadiums were built and opened in advance of the tournament. The remaining three stadiums (in Kyiv, Poznań and Kharkiv) underwent major renovations in order to meet UEFA's infrastructure standards.[27][28] Three of the stadiums are categorised as UEFA's highest category stadiums. The transport infrastructure in Poland and Ukraine was also extensively modified on the request of UEFA to cope with the large influx of football fans.[29]\n\n\nUEFA organised fan zones in the eight host cities. They were located in the centre of each city, with all 31 matches shown live on a total of 24 giant screens. The zones enabled supporters to come together in a secure and controlled environment. The Warsaw Fan Zone occupied 120,000 square meters and accommodated 100,000 visitors. In all, the fans zones had a 20% increase in capacity compared to Euro 2008.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEuro 2012 was played at eight venues, four in each host country. Five new stadiums were built for the tournament, and the hosts invested heavily in improving infrastructure such as railways and roads at UEFA's request. Euro 2012 set attendance records for the 16-team format, for the highest aggregate attendance (1,440,896) and average per game (46,481).\n\n\nSpain became the first team to win two consecutive European Championships, and also three straight major tournaments (Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012).[3] Spain had already gained entry to the 2013 Confederations Cup by winning the World Cup, so runners-up Italy qualified instead. As at Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, both 2012 host nations were eliminated in the group stage.\n\n\nThere were several players ending on a total of 3 goals but because Fernando Torres made an assist and played the fewest minutes of the players who scored three goals, he was named as the Golden Boot winner for the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPoland–Ukraine became the third successful joint bid for the European Championship, after those of Belgium–Netherlands (2000) and Austria–Switzerland (2008). Their bid received an absolute majority of votes, and was therefore announced the winner, without requiring a second round. Italy, which received the remaining votes,[2] had been considered favourites to win the hosting, but incidents of fan violence and a match-fixing scandal were widely cited as factors behind their failure.[9][10][11]\n\n\nThere were some later alterations from the initial bid plan, regarding the venues, before UEFA confirmed the eight host cities in 2009.[12][13] During the preparation process in Poland and Ukraine, UEFA repeatedly expressed concern about their preparation to host the event, with different candidates reported as being alternative hosts if they did not improve;[14][15] however, in the end, UEFA affirmed their selection.[16]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Spain overpower Italy to win UEFA EURO 2012\".

With the exception of Serbia – according to UEFA's ranking at the end of the qualifying stage – Europe's sixteen highest-ranked teams all qualified for the tournament.\n\n\nRomania and Turkey were the only teams failing to qualify for the final tournament after qualifying to UEFA Euro 2008.

The final tournament, held between 8 June and 1 July 2012, was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine (both first time hosts), and was won by Spain, who beat Italy in the final at the Olympic Stadium, Kyiv, Ukraine.[1]\n\n\nPoland and Ukraine's bid was chosen by the UEFA Executive Committee on 18 April 2007.[2] The two host teams qualified automatically while the remaining 14 finalists were decided through a qualifying competition, featuring 51 teams, from August 2010 to November 2011. This was the last European Championship to employ the 16-team finals format in use since 1996; from Euro 2016 onward, it was expanded to 24 finalists.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Chaplin, Mark (30 January 2009). \"UEFA lays out priorities for 2009\". *UEFA.com*.

Applications had to be made during March 2011 for the 1.4 million tickets available for the 31 tournament matches.[31] Over 20,000 were forecast to cross the Poland–Ukraine border each day during the tournament.[32] Over 12 million applications were received, which represented a 17% increase on the 2008 finals, and an all-time record for the UEFA European Championship.[33] Owing to this over-subscription for the matches, lotteries were carried out to allocate tickets. Prices varied from €30 (£25) (for a seat behind the goals at a group match) to €600 (£513) (for a seat in the main stand at the final). In addition to individual match tickets, fans could buy packages to see either all matches played by one team, or all matches at one specific venue.[34]\n\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe draw for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying competition took place in Warsaw on 7 February 2010.[17] Fifty-one teams entered to compete for the fourteen remaining places in the finals, alongside co-hosts Poland and Ukraine. The teams were divided into nine groups, with the draw using the new UEFA national team coefficient for the first time in order to determine the seedings. As defending champions, Spain was automatically top-seeded. The qualifying process began in August 2010 and concluded in November 2011. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in October 2011, the nine group winners qualified automatically, along with the highest ranked second placed team. The remaining eight-second placed teams contested two-legged play-offs, and the four winners qualified for the finals.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOlympic Stadium, Kyiv\nAttendance: 64,640[69]\nReferee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n19 June 2012 (2012-06-19)\n21:45 EEST\n\n\n| England ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Ukraine |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Rooney ![](image) 48'\n | Report |  |\n\nDonbass Arena, Donetsk\nAttendance: 48,700[70]\nReferee: Viktor Kassai (Hungary)\n\n19 June 2012 (2012-06-19)\n21:45 EEST\n\n\n| Sweden ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ibrahimović ![](image) 54'\n* Larsson ![](image) 90+1'\n | Report |  |\n\nOlympic Stadium, Kyiv\nAttendance: 63,010[71]\nReferee: Pedro Proença (Portugal)\n\n## Knockout stage[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 knockout stage\n\n![](image)Spain players holding the *Henri Delaunay Trophy*.\nIn the knockout phase, extra time and a penalty shoot-out were used to decide the winner if necessary.\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEach team had a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches.

Variations of the ball have been used in other contemporary competitions including the Africa Cup of Nations and the Summer Olympics. It is designed to be easier to dribble and control than the reportedly unpredictable Adidas Jabulani used at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[38]\n\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament.

In a return to the format used at Euro 1992, Euro 1996 and Euro 2008, each of the four groups' matches were played in two stadiums. Host cities Warsaw, Gdańsk, Wrocław, Poznań, Kyiv, and Lviv are all popular tourist destinations, unlike Donetsk and Kharkiv, the latter of which replaced Dnipropetrovsk as a host city in 2009.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2012 stadiums\n |\n| --- |\n| Poland | * National Stadium (Warsaw)\n* Gdańsk Stadium (Gdańsk)\n* Wrocław Stadium (Wrocław)\n* Poznań Stadium (Poznań)\n |\n| Ukraine | * NSC Olimpiyskiy (Kyiv)\n* Donbass Arena (Donetsk)\n* Metalist Stadium (Kharkiv)\n* Arena Lviv (Lviv)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn order to meet UEFA's requirement for football infrastructure improvements, five new stadiums were built and opened in advance of the tournament. The remaining three stadiums (in Kyiv, Poznań and Kharkiv) underwent major renovations in order to meet UEFA's infrastructure standards.[27][28] Three of the stadiums are categorised as UEFA's highest category stadiums. The transport infrastructure in Poland and Ukraine was also extensively modified on the request of UEFA to cope with the large influx of football fans.[29]\n\n\nUEFA organised fan zones in the eight host cities. They were located in the centre of each city, with all 31 matches shown live on a total of 24 giant screens. The zones enabled supporters to come together in a secure and controlled environment. The Warsaw Fan Zone occupied 120,000 square meters and accommodated 100,000 visitors. In all, the fans zones had a 20% increase in capacity compared to Euro 2008.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEuro 2012 was played at eight venues, four in each host country. Five new stadiums were built for the tournament, and the hosts invested heavily in improving infrastructure such as railways and roads at UEFA's request. Euro 2012 set attendance records for the 16-team format, for the highest aggregate attendance (1,440,896) and average per game (46,481).\n\n\nSpain became the first team to win two consecutive European Championships, and also three straight major tournaments (Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012).[3] Spain had already gained entry to the 2013 Confederations Cup by winning the World Cup, so runners-up Italy qualified instead. As at Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, both 2012 host nations were eliminated in the group stage.\n\n\nThere were several players ending on a total of 3 goals but because Fernando Torres made an assist and played the fewest minutes of the players who scored three goals, he was named as the Golden Boot winner for the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPoland–Ukraine became the third successful joint bid for the European Championship, after those of Belgium–Netherlands (2000) and Austria–Switzerland (2008). Their bid received an absolute majority of votes, and was therefore announced the winner, without requiring a second round. Italy, which received the remaining votes,[2] had been considered favourites to win the hosting, but incidents of fan violence and a match-fixing scandal were widely cited as factors behind their failure.[9][10][11]\n\n\nThere were some later alterations from the initial bid plan, regarding the venues, before UEFA confirmed the eight host cities in 2009.[12][13] During the preparation process in Poland and Ukraine, UEFA repeatedly expressed concern about their preparation to host the event, with different candidates reported as being alternative hosts if they did not improve;[14][15] however, in the end, UEFA affirmed their selection.[16]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Spain overpower Italy to win UEFA EURO 2012\".

With the exception of Serbia – according to UEFA's ranking at the end of the qualifying stage – Europe's sixteen highest-ranked teams all qualified for the tournament.\n\n\nRomania and Turkey were the only teams failing to qualify for the final tournament after qualifying to UEFA Euro 2008.

The final tournament, held between 8 June and 1 July 2012, was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine (both first time hosts), and was won by Spain, who beat Italy in the final at the Olympic Stadium, Kyiv, Ukraine.[1]\n\n\nPoland and Ukraine's bid was chosen by the UEFA Executive Committee on 18 April 2007.[2] The two host teams qualified automatically while the remaining 14 finalists were decided through a qualifying competition, featuring 51 teams, from August 2010 to November 2011. This was the last European Championship to employ the 16-team finals format in use since 1996; from Euro 2016 onward, it was expanded to 24 finalists.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Chaplin, Mark (30 January 2009). \"UEFA lays out priorities for 2009\". *UEFA.com*.

Applications had to be made during March 2011 for the 1.4 million tickets available for the 31 tournament matches.[31] Over 20,000 were forecast to cross the Poland–Ukraine border each day during the tournament.[32] Over 12 million applications were received, which represented a 17% increase on the 2008 finals, and an all-time record for the UEFA European Championship.[33] Owing to this over-subscription for the matches, lotteries were carried out to allocate tickets. Prices varied from €30 (£25) (for a seat behind the goals at a group match) to €600 (£513) (for a seat in the main stand at the final). In addition to individual match tickets, fans could buy packages to see either all matches played by one team, or all matches at one specific venue.[34]\n\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe draw for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying competition took place in Warsaw on 7 February 2010.[17] Fifty-one teams entered to compete for the fourteen remaining places in the finals, alongside co-hosts Poland and Ukraine. The teams were divided into nine groups, with the draw using the new UEFA national team coefficient for the first time in order to determine the seedings. As defending champions, Spain was automatically top-seeded. The qualifying process began in August 2010 and concluded in November 2011. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in October 2011, the nine group winners qualified automatically, along with the highest ranked second placed team. The remaining eight-second placed teams contested two-legged play-offs, and the four winners qualified for the finals.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOlympic Stadium, Kyiv\nAttendance: 64,640[69]\nReferee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n19 June 2012 (2012-06-19)\n21:45 EEST\n\n\n| England ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Ukraine |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Rooney ![](image) 48'\n | Report |  |\n\nDonbass Arena, Donetsk\nAttendance: 48,700[70]\nReferee: Viktor Kassai (Hungary)\n\n19 June 2012 (2012-06-19)\n21:45 EEST\n\n\n| Sweden ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ibrahimović ![](image) 54'\n* Larsson ![](image) 90+1'\n | Report |  |\n\nOlympic Stadium, Kyiv\nAttendance: 63,010[71]\nReferee: Pedro Proença (Portugal)\n\n## Knockout stage[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 knockout stage\n\n![](image)Spain players holding the *Henri Delaunay Trophy*.\nIn the knockout phase, extra time and a penalty shoot-out were used to decide the winner if necessary.\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEach team had a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches.

Variations of the ball have been used in other contemporary competitions including the Africa Cup of Nations and the Summer Olympics. It is designed to be easier to dribble and control than the reportedly unpredictable Adidas Jabulani used at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[38]\n\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament.

In a return to the format used at Euro 1992 and Euro 1996 the games in each group were held at just two stadia, with the seeded team playing all three matches in the same city. Switzerland and Austria, as co-hosts, were automatically assigned to positions A1 and B1, respectively. The remaining 14 teams were split into four pots, with title-holders Greece seeded alongside the Netherlands in Pot 1.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland '07 '08\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan '07 '08\n* Latvia '07 '08\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Norway '07 '08\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '07 '08\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Scotland\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden '07 '08\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* Wales\n |\n| League cups | * England\n* Finland '07 '08\n* France\n* Germany\n* Hungary\n* Iceland '07 '08\n* Israel\n* Northern Ireland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '07 '08\n* Scotland\n* Wales\n |\n| UEFA competitions | * Champions League (Qualifying rounds, Group stage, Knockout stage, Final)\n* UEFA Cup (Qualifying rounds, First round, Group stage, Knockout stage, Final)\n* Intertoto Cup\n* Super Cup\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** \"Telekom Austria signs National Supporter agreement for UEFA EURO 2008™\" (PDF).\n84. **^** \"UEFA EURO 2008™: Hublot to be Official Watch and Official Timekeeper of UEFA EURO 2008™\" (PDF).\n85. **^** UEFA.com (16 September 2010). \"INTERSPORT becomes retail licensee | UEFA EURO\". *UEFA.com*.

Teams in groups A and B were separated from teams in groups C and D until the final. This meant that two teams who meet in the same group would meet again in the semi-finals instead of the final if they got this far. Also, in another major change, for the first time in a European Championship, only two venues (St. Jakob-Park, Basel and Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna—the two largest of the eight stadiums used) were used for the seven matches in the knockout phase of the tournament.[47]\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2004, the Zürich venue became a problem for the organisers. Originally, the Hardturm stadium was to be renovated and used as the city's venue, but legal challenges delayed the plan to a point that would not have allowed the ground to be used in 2008. This created a problem, as the agreement between UEFA and the organisers stipulated that four venues would be used in each country. The problem was solved when the organisers proposed renovating Letzigrund instead;[16] UEFA approved the revised plan in January 2005. The Letzigrund stadium hosted its first football match on 23 September 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2008\n |\n| --- |\n| Stages | * Qualification\n* Group stage\n\t+ Group A\n\t+ Group B\n\t+ Group C\n\t+ Group D\n* Knockout phase\n* Final\n |\n| General information | * Bids\n\t+ Scotland–Ireland\n* Broadcasting\n* Squads\n* Statistics\n |\n| Official symbols | * Europass (ball)\n* Trix and Flix (mascot)\n* *UEFA Euro 2008* (video game)\n* \"Can You Hear Me\" (song)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2008 finalists\n |\n| --- |\n| Champions | **Spain**\n |\n| Runners-up | Germany\n |\n| Eliminated in the semi-finals | * Russia\n* Turkey\n |\n| Eliminated in the quarter-finals | * Croatia\n* Italy\n* Netherlands\n* Portugal\n |\n| Eliminated in the group stage | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Group A | * Czech Republic\n* Switzerland\n |\n| Group B | * Austria\n* Poland\n |\n| Group C | * France\n* Romania\n |\n| Group D | * Greece\n* Sweden\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n12 out of 16 teams who qualified for previous tournament also qualified, but the hosts, Austria, and Poland made their debuts at the European Championship.

Austria–Switzerland\n2. Hungary\n3. Greece–Turkey\n4. Nordic\n5. Scotland–Ireland\n6. Russia\n7. Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia\n\n\nThe Austria–Switzerland bid became the second successful joint bid in the competition's history, following the UEFA Euro 2000 hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands. The following tournament, held in Poland and Ukraine, became the third jointly hosted tournament.\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **2008 UEFA European Football Championship**, commonly referred to as **UEFA Euro 2008** or simply **Euro 2008**, was the 13th UEFA European Championship, a quadrennial football tournament contested by the member nations of UEFA (the Union of European Football Associations). It took place in Austria and Switzerland (both hosting the tournament for the first time) from 7 to 29 June 2008.\n\n\nThe tournament was won by Spain, who defeated Germany 1–0 in the final. Spain were only the second nation to win all their group stage fixtures and then the European Championship itself, matching France's achievement from 1984. Spain were also the first team since Germany in 1996 to win the tournament undefeated.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"UEFA National Team Ranking 2007\".

In a return to the format used at Euro 1992 and Euro 1996 the games in each group were held at just two stadia, with the seeded team playing all three matches in the same city. Switzerland and Austria, as co-hosts, were automatically assigned to positions A1 and B1, respectively. The remaining 14 teams were split into four pots, with title-holders Greece seeded alongside the Netherlands in Pot 1.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland '07 '08\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan '07 '08\n* Latvia '07 '08\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Norway '07 '08\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '07 '08\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Scotland\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden '07 '08\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* Wales\n |\n| League cups | * England\n* Finland '07 '08\n* France\n* Germany\n* Hungary\n* Iceland '07 '08\n* Israel\n* Northern Ireland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '07 '08\n* Scotland\n* Wales\n |\n| UEFA competitions | * Champions League (Qualifying rounds, Group stage, Knockout stage, Final)\n* UEFA Cup (Qualifying rounds, First round, Group stage, Knockout stage, Final)\n* Intertoto Cup\n* Super Cup\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** \"Telekom Austria signs National Supporter agreement for UEFA EURO 2008™\" (PDF).\n84. **^** \"UEFA EURO 2008™: Hublot to be Official Watch and Official Timekeeper of UEFA EURO 2008™\" (PDF).\n85. **^** UEFA.com (16 September 2010). \"INTERSPORT becomes retail licensee | UEFA EURO\". *UEFA.com*.

Teams in groups A and B were separated from teams in groups C and D until the final. This meant that two teams who meet in the same group would meet again in the semi-finals instead of the final if they got this far. Also, in another major change, for the first time in a European Championship, only two venues (St. Jakob-Park, Basel and Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna—the two largest of the eight stadiums used) were used for the seven matches in the knockout phase of the tournament.[47]\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2004, the Zürich venue became a problem for the organisers. Originally, the Hardturm stadium was to be renovated and used as the city's venue, but legal challenges delayed the plan to a point that would not have allowed the ground to be used in 2008. This created a problem, as the agreement between UEFA and the organisers stipulated that four venues would be used in each country. The problem was solved when the organisers proposed renovating Letzigrund instead;[16] UEFA approved the revised plan in January 2005. The Letzigrund stadium hosted its first football match on 23 September 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2008\n |\n| --- |\n| Stages | * Qualification\n* Group stage\n\t+ Group A\n\t+ Group B\n\t+ Group C\n\t+ Group D\n* Knockout phase\n* Final\n |\n| General information | * Bids\n\t+ Scotland–Ireland\n* Broadcasting\n* Squads\n* Statistics\n |\n| Official symbols | * Europass (ball)\n* Trix and Flix (mascot)\n* *UEFA Euro 2008* (video game)\n* \"Can You Hear Me\" (song)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2008 finalists\n |\n| --- |\n| Champions | **Spain**\n |\n| Runners-up | Germany\n |\n| Eliminated in the semi-finals | * Russia\n* Turkey\n |\n| Eliminated in the quarter-finals | * Croatia\n* Italy\n* Netherlands\n* Portugal\n |\n| Eliminated in the group stage | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Group A | * Czech Republic\n* Switzerland\n |\n| Group B | * Austria\n* Poland\n |\n| Group C | * France\n* Romania\n |\n| Group D | * Greece\n* Sweden\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n12 out of 16 teams who qualified for previous tournament also qualified, but the hosts, Austria, and Poland made their debuts at the European Championship.

Austria–Switzerland\n2. Hungary\n3. Greece–Turkey\n4. Nordic\n5. Scotland–Ireland\n6. Russia\n7. Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia\n\n\nThe Austria–Switzerland bid became the second successful joint bid in the competition's history, following the UEFA Euro 2000 hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands. The following tournament, held in Poland and Ukraine, became the third jointly hosted tournament.\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **2008 UEFA European Football Championship**, commonly referred to as **UEFA Euro 2008** or simply **Euro 2008**, was the 13th UEFA European Championship, a quadrennial football tournament contested by the member nations of UEFA (the Union of European Football Associations). It took place in Austria and Switzerland (both hosting the tournament for the first time) from 7 to 29 June 2008.\n\n\nThe tournament was won by Spain, who defeated Germany 1–0 in the final. Spain were only the second nation to win all their group stage fixtures and then the European Championship itself, matching France's achievement from 1984. Spain were also the first team since Germany in 1996 to win the tournament undefeated.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"UEFA National Team Ranking 2007\".

The pot allocations were based on the 2003-edition of the UEFA national team coefficient ranking, which measured performance of teams in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying and UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying. The coefficient was calculated by dividing the number of all points scored (three points for a win, one for a draw) by the number of all matches played. Results from the final tournaments, play-off matches and friendly games were all ignored.[38] As host country, Portugal were automatically placed in position A1, and would hereby play the opening match of the final tournament. The remaining 15 teams were split into four pots, with title-holders France seeded alongside Sweden and the Czech Republic in the first pot.[39][40]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEstádio Algarve, Faro/Loulé\nAttendance: 27,762\nReferee: Ľuboš Micheľ (Slovakia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n27 June 2004 (2004-06-27)\n19:45\n\n\n| Czech Republic ![](image) | 3–0 | ![](image) Denmark |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Koller ![](image) 49'\n* Baroš ![](image) 63', 65'\n | Report |  |\n\nEstádio do Dragão, Porto\nAttendance: 41,092\nReferee: Valentin Ivanov (Russia)\n\n### Semi-finals[edit]\n\n\n30 June 2004 (2004-06-30)\n19:45\n\n\n| Portugal ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ronaldo ![](image) 26'\n* Maniche ![](image) 58'\n | Report | * Andrade ![](image) 63' (o.g.)\n |\n\nEstádio José Alvalade, Lisbon\nAttendance: 46,679\nReferee: Anders Frisk (Sweden)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1 July 2004 (2004-07-01)\n19:45\n\n\n| Greece ![](image) | 1–0 (a.e.t./s.g.) | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Dellas ![silver-colored soccer ball](image) 105+1'\n | Report |  |\n\nEstádio do Dragão, Porto\nAttendance: 42,449\nReferee: Pierluigi Collina (Italy)\n\n### Final[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2004 final\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the first time in an international football tournament, the silver goal system was applied, whereby the team that led the game at the half-time break during the extra time period would be declared the winner.[70] If the scores were still level after the initial 15 minutes of extra time, play would continue for a further 15 minutes. If the teams could still not be separated after the extra time, there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each) to determine which team progressed to the next round.[70] The silver goal replaced the golden goal from the previous two championships and was used in the semi-final between Greece and the Czech Republic.\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, WEST (UTC+1).*\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Host | 12 October 1999 | 3 (1984, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group 1 winner | 10 September 2003 | 5 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996, **2000**)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[B] | Group 3 winner | 10 September 2003 | 5 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Group 4 winner | 10 September 2003 | 2 (*1992*, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Bulgaria | Group 8 winner | 10 September 2003 | 1 (1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 2 winner | 11 October 2003 | 6 (1964, 1984, 1988, **1992**, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[C] | Group 5 winner | 11 October 2003 | 8 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | Group 6 winner | 11 October 2003 | 1 (1980)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group 7 winner | 11 October 2003 | 6 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992, *1996*, 2000)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the two months ahead of the tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy travelled across Portugal to promote the European Championship finals in the host country.

Portugal recovered from an opening defeat against Greece to reach the final, eliminating England and the Netherlands along the way. For the first time in a major European football tournament, the last match featured the same teams as the opening match.[3] Portugal were again defeated by Greece with a goal from Angelos Charisteas.[4] Greece's triumph was unexpected, considering that they had only qualified for two other major tournaments: UEFA Euro 1980, at which they managed just one point, and the 1994 FIFA World Cup, where they lost all three matches. As winners, Greece earned the right to represent Europe at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEuro 2004 marked the introduction of the penalty shoot-out as a tiebreaker between two teams in the group stage, although no match required the use of this procedure.

The pot allocations were based on the 2003-edition of the UEFA national team coefficient ranking, which measured performance of teams in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying and UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying. The coefficient was calculated by dividing the number of all points scored (three points for a win, one for a draw) by the number of all matches played. Results from the final tournaments, play-off matches and friendly games were all ignored.[38] As host country, Portugal were automatically placed in position A1, and would hereby play the opening match of the final tournament. The remaining 15 teams were split into four pots, with title-holders France seeded alongside Sweden and the Czech Republic in the first pot.[39][40]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEstádio Algarve, Faro/Loulé\nAttendance: 27,762\nReferee: Ľuboš Micheľ (Slovakia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n27 June 2004 (2004-06-27)\n19:45\n\n\n| Czech Republic ![](image) | 3–0 | ![](image) Denmark |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Koller ![](image) 49'\n* Baroš ![](image) 63', 65'\n | Report |  |\n\nEstádio do Dragão, Porto\nAttendance: 41,092\nReferee: Valentin Ivanov (Russia)\n\n### Semi-finals[edit]\n\n\n30 June 2004 (2004-06-30)\n19:45\n\n\n| Portugal ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ronaldo ![](image) 26'\n* Maniche ![](image) 58'\n | Report | * Andrade ![](image) 63' (o.g.)\n |\n\nEstádio José Alvalade, Lisbon\nAttendance: 46,679\nReferee: Anders Frisk (Sweden)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1 July 2004 (2004-07-01)\n19:45\n\n\n| Greece ![](image) | 1–0 (a.e.t./s.g.) | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Dellas ![silver-colored soccer ball](image) 105+1'\n | Report |  |\n\nEstádio do Dragão, Porto\nAttendance: 42,449\nReferee: Pierluigi Collina (Italy)\n\n### Final[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2004 final\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the first time in an international football tournament, the silver goal system was applied, whereby the team that led the game at the half-time break during the extra time period would be declared the winner.[70] If the scores were still level after the initial 15 minutes of extra time, play would continue for a further 15 minutes. If the teams could still not be separated after the extra time, there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each) to determine which team progressed to the next round.[70] The silver goal replaced the golden goal from the previous two championships and was used in the semi-final between Greece and the Czech Republic.\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, WEST (UTC+1).*\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Host | 12 October 1999 | 3 (1984, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group 1 winner | 10 September 2003 | 5 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996, **2000**)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[B] | Group 3 winner | 10 September 2003 | 5 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Group 4 winner | 10 September 2003 | 2 (*1992*, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Bulgaria | Group 8 winner | 10 September 2003 | 1 (1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 2 winner | 11 October 2003 | 6 (1964, 1984, 1988, **1992**, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[C] | Group 5 winner | 11 October 2003 | 8 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | Group 6 winner | 11 October 2003 | 1 (1980)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group 7 winner | 11 October 2003 | 6 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992, *1996*, 2000)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the two months ahead of the tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy travelled across Portugal to promote the European Championship finals in the host country.

Portugal recovered from an opening defeat against Greece to reach the final, eliminating England and the Netherlands along the way. For the first time in a major European football tournament, the last match featured the same teams as the opening match.[3] Portugal were again defeated by Greece with a goal from Angelos Charisteas.[4] Greece's triumph was unexpected, considering that they had only qualified for two other major tournaments: UEFA Euro 1980, at which they managed just one point, and the 1994 FIFA World Cup, where they lost all three matches. As winners, Greece earned the right to represent Europe at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEuro 2004 marked the introduction of the penalty shoot-out as a tiebreaker between two teams in the group stage, although no match required the use of this procedure.

There were concerns that hooliganism would overshadow the finals. Many instances of violence occurred, including several football riots in Rotterdam between 1995 and 1999, which would host the Euro 2000 final. One of the most infamous incidents was the Battle of Beverwijk in 1997. Although the violence is normally associated with domestic clubs, there were concerns that it could attach to the Dutch national team.[10][11]\n\n\nViolence did eventually occur during the Euro 2000 finals, albeit not involving the Dutch team. On 17 June 174 England fans were arrested in Brussels, Belgium, following violence with Germans ahead of an England v Germany match.[12]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_gf8tBCLDQPmbHGyd53MIqm0E","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Belgium and the Netherlands automatically qualified for the tournament as co-hosts.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time Serbia (then FR Yugoslavia) qualified for the European Championship finals, the only time that Norway and Slovenia qualified, as well as the last time that Croatia failed to qualify.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![Sweden](image) Anders Frisk | ![Republic of Ireland](image) Eddie Foley\n |  |\n| ![Switzerland](image) Urs Meier | ![Romania](image) Nicolae Grigorescu\n |  |\n|  | ![Slovakia](image) Igor Šramka\n |  |\n|  | ![Spain](image) Carlos Martín Nieto\n |  |\n|  | ![Sweden](image) Leif Lindberg\n |  |\n|  | ![Turkey](image) Turgay Güdü\n |  |\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UEFA Euro 2000 finalists and their results\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the four groups progress to the quarter-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:[55]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe composition of pots 1 to 4 was based on the teams' UEFA national team coefficient ranking at the end of 1999,[26] with the exception of pot 1 automatically top seeding Germany as holders along with co-hosts Belgium and Netherlands.[27][28][25]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** \"Suppliers\". *UEFA.com*.

There were concerns that hooliganism would overshadow the finals. Many instances of violence occurred, including several football riots in Rotterdam between 1995 and 1999, which would host the Euro 2000 final. One of the most infamous incidents was the Battle of Beverwijk in 1997. Although the violence is normally associated with domestic clubs, there were concerns that it could attach to the Dutch national team.[10][11]\n\n\nViolence did eventually occur during the Euro 2000 finals, albeit not involving the Dutch team. On 17 June 174 England fans were arrested in Brussels, Belgium, following violence with Germans ahead of an England v Germany match.[12]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_gf8tBCLDQPmbHGyd53MIqm0E","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Croatia, the Czech Republic and Russia competed for the first time in their own right since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union (though the Russian team is considered by FIFA to be the direct descendant of the Soviet Union and CIS teams that had appeared in six past tournaments and the Czech team is the descendant of the Czechoslovakia team). Seven of the eight participants at the previous tournament in 1992 were again present, with only Sweden – despite also having finished third in the World Cup two years earlier – missing out. Italy qualified after missing out Euro 1992 and Romania and Portugal after 12 years.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time that Sweden failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.\n\n\nThe following sixteen teams qualified for the finals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"England fans riot after defeat\". *The Times*.

The qualifying process began in April 1994 and concluded in December 1995. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in November 1995, the eight group winners qualified automatically, along with the six highest-ranked second-placed teams. The remaining two second-placed teams, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, contested a one-off play-off match in England to decide the final qualifier.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Overall records | * Team appearances\n* Player appearances\n* Goalscorers\n\t+ Hat-tricks\n\t+ Own goals\n* Penalty shoot-outs\n* Red cards\n* Winning players\n* Winning managers\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Awards\n* Music\n* Mascots\n* Balls\n* Video games\n |\n| * † *Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe*\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe hosting of the event was contested by five bids: Austria, England, Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal. The English bid was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting in Lisbon on 5 May 1992.[5] In the year preceding the decision, the English FA had dropped plans to also bid for the 1998 World Cup in order to gain the support of other UEFA members who were planning to bid for that event.[5]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe hosts, England, drew 1–1 with Switzerland in the opening match of Group A when Alan Shearer's 23rd-minute goal was cancelled out by a late Kubilay Türkyilmaz penalty kick.[6] England defeated rivals Scotland 2–0 in their next game, and then produced one of their finest performances ever with a 4–1 win over the Netherlands.[7] Patrick Kluivert's late goal for the Netherlands secured his team second place in the group and ensured that Scotland would exit another major competition on tie-breaking criteria.[8]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** \"Lot Oranje last voor fans\" [Oranje draw burden for fans]. *De Stem* (in Dutch).

The large number of empty seats in most of the games not involving England was blamed on a number of factors: a lack of travelling fans from most of the other nations concerned, a lack of interest among locals for games not involving England, kick-offs before 5:00 pm that made it hard for children at school and adults at work to attend, steep ticket prices, and UEFA's policy of only selling tickets in blocks (where each block consisted of a set from each of three price bands).[47]\n\n\n\n### Disorder[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7.

The four groups (A to D) still contained four teams each, with the top two from each group still going through to the knockout phase. 8 teams then went into the new quarter-finals, ahead of the usual semi-finals and final, with 8 teams going out at the group stage. The format is exactly the one which was applied to the 1958, 1962, 1966 and 1970 World Cups, except for the absence of a third place play-off.\n\n\n\n## Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Questra\n\nA custom version of the Adidas Questra, the *Questra Europa*, was the official match ball of the championships. The design of the ball included a reworking of the England badge, and was the first coloured ball in a major football tournament.[32]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany won the tournament, beating the Czech Republic 2–1 in the final with a golden goal from Oliver Bierhoff during extra time; this was the first major competition to be decided using this method. This was also Germany's first major title won as a unified nation, adding to the two European Championship titles won by West Germany prior to reunification.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nAt the time of the bidding process, it had not yet been confirmed that 16 teams would be participating. Instead, the bids were largely prepared as if hosting an eight-team tournament, meaning only four venues were due to be required.[3] All candidates had to submit their plans by 10 December 1991.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1995–96 in European football (UEFA)\n |\n| --- |\n| Domestic leagues | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus '95 '96\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina (Herzeg-Bosnia, Republika Srpska)\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* England\n* Estonia\n* Faroe Islands '95 '96\n* Finland '95 '96\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland '95 '96\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan '95 '96\n* Latvia '95 '96\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Norway '95 '96\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland\n* Romania\n* Russia '95 '96\n* San Marino\n* Scotland\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden '95 '96\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* Wales\n* FR Yugoslavia\n |\n| Domestic cups | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* England\n* Estonia\n* Faroe Islands '95 '96\n* Finland '95 '96\n* France\n* Georgia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| France ![](image) | 0–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| * Zidane ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Djorkaeff ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Lizarazu ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Guérin ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Blanc ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 5–4 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) De Kock\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) De Boer\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Kluivert\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Seedorf\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Blind\n |\n\nAnfield, Liverpool\nAttendance: 37,465[19]\nReferee: Antonio López Nieto (Spain)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n23 June 1996 (1996-06-23)\n15:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Croatia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Klinsmann ![](image) 20' (pen.)\n* Sammer ![](image) 59'\n | Report | * Šuker ![](image) 51'\n |\n\nOld Trafford, Manchester\nAttendance: 43,412[20]\nReferee: Leif Sundell (Sweden)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n23 June 1996 (1996-06-23)\n18:30\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA terrorist attack took place in Manchester on 15 June, one day before the group stage match between Germany and Russia was due to take place in the same city.[45] The detonation of a van bomb in the city centre injured 212 people and caused an estimated £700 million worth of damage. Four days after the blast, the Provisional Irish Republican Army issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility, but regretted causing injury to civilians.[46]\n\n\nThe Manchester bombing was the first and so far only major terrorist attack in the host city of an ongoing UEFA European Championship. The scheduled match at Old Trafford on the day following the bombing went ahead as planned after the stadium had been heavily guarded overnight and carefully searched; the game, in which Germany defeated Russia 3–0, was watched by a near capacity crowd of 50,700.\n\n\n\n### Empty seats[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter England's defeat to Germany in the semi-finals, a large-scale riot took place in Trafalgar Square and the surrounding area. Further outbreaks of trouble occurred in the streets of several other towns. The police and German-made cars were targeted, with damage also caused to various other properties.[48] A Russian student was stabbed in Brighton after attackers mistook him for being German.[49]\n\n\nDespite this outbreak, the tournament overall was free of hooliganism, helping rehabilitate England's reputation after their fans' conduct during the previous decades.[48] UEFA's awarding of the tournament to England was in itself a further step in bringing the country back fully into the international fold, coming soon after their decision in 1990 to re-admit English clubs back into UEFA competitions after the indefinite ban issued to them following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.[50][51]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Shaw, Phil (17 June 1996). \"Euro '96: Suker sinks Denmark\". *The Independent*.

Croatia, the Czech Republic and Russia competed for the first time in their own right since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union (though the Russian team is considered by FIFA to be the direct descendant of the Soviet Union and CIS teams that had appeared in six past tournaments and the Czech team is the descendant of the Czechoslovakia team). Seven of the eight participants at the previous tournament in 1992 were again present, with only Sweden – despite also having finished third in the World Cup two years earlier – missing out. Italy qualified after missing out Euro 1992 and Romania and Portugal after 12 years.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time that Sweden failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.\n\n\nThe following sixteen teams qualified for the finals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"England fans riot after defeat\". *The Times*.

The qualifying process began in April 1994 and concluded in December 1995. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in November 1995, the eight group winners qualified automatically, along with the six highest-ranked second-placed teams. The remaining two second-placed teams, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, contested a one-off play-off match in England to decide the final qualifier.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Overall records | * Team appearances\n* Player appearances\n* Goalscorers\n\t+ Hat-tricks\n\t+ Own goals\n* Penalty shoot-outs\n* Red cards\n* Winning players\n* Winning managers\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Awards\n* Music\n* Mascots\n* Balls\n* Video games\n |\n| * † *Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe*\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe hosting of the event was contested by five bids: Austria, England, Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal. The English bid was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting in Lisbon on 5 May 1992.[5] In the year preceding the decision, the English FA had dropped plans to also bid for the 1998 World Cup in order to gain the support of other UEFA members who were planning to bid for that event.[5]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe hosts, England, drew 1–1 with Switzerland in the opening match of Group A when Alan Shearer's 23rd-minute goal was cancelled out by a late Kubilay Türkyilmaz penalty kick.[6] England defeated rivals Scotland 2–0 in their next game, and then produced one of their finest performances ever with a 4–1 win over the Netherlands.[7] Patrick Kluivert's late goal for the Netherlands secured his team second place in the group and ensured that Scotland would exit another major competition on tie-breaking criteria.[8]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** \"Lot Oranje last voor fans\" [Oranje draw burden for fans]. *De Stem* (in Dutch).

The large number of empty seats in most of the games not involving England was blamed on a number of factors: a lack of travelling fans from most of the other nations concerned, a lack of interest among locals for games not involving England, kick-offs before 5:00 pm that made it hard for children at school and adults at work to attend, steep ticket prices, and UEFA's policy of only selling tickets in blocks (where each block consisted of a set from each of three price bands).[47]\n\n\n\n### Disorder[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7.

The four groups (A to D) still contained four teams each, with the top two from each group still going through to the knockout phase. 8 teams then went into the new quarter-finals, ahead of the usual semi-finals and final, with 8 teams going out at the group stage. The format is exactly the one which was applied to the 1958, 1962, 1966 and 1970 World Cups, except for the absence of a third place play-off.\n\n\n\n## Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Questra\n\nA custom version of the Adidas Questra, the *Questra Europa*, was the official match ball of the championships. The design of the ball included a reworking of the England badge, and was the first coloured ball in a major football tournament.[32]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany won the tournament, beating the Czech Republic 2–1 in the final with a golden goal from Oliver Bierhoff during extra time; this was the first major competition to be decided using this method. This was also Germany's first major title won as a unified nation, adding to the two European Championship titles won by West Germany prior to reunification.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nAt the time of the bidding process, it had not yet been confirmed that 16 teams would be participating. Instead, the bids were largely prepared as if hosting an eight-team tournament, meaning only four venues were due to be required.[3] All candidates had to submit their plans by 10 December 1991.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1995–96 in European football (UEFA)\n |\n| --- |\n| Domestic leagues | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus '95 '96\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina (Herzeg-Bosnia, Republika Srpska)\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* England\n* Estonia\n* Faroe Islands '95 '96\n* Finland '95 '96\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland '95 '96\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan '95 '96\n* Latvia '95 '96\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Norway '95 '96\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland\n* Romania\n* Russia '95 '96\n* San Marino\n* Scotland\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden '95 '96\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* Wales\n* FR Yugoslavia\n |\n| Domestic cups | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* England\n* Estonia\n* Faroe Islands '95 '96\n* Finland '95 '96\n* France\n* Georgia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| France ![](image) | 0–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| * Zidane ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Djorkaeff ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Lizarazu ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Guérin ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Blanc ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 5–4 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) De Kock\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) De Boer\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Kluivert\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Seedorf\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Blind\n |\n\nAnfield, Liverpool\nAttendance: 37,465[19]\nReferee: Antonio López Nieto (Spain)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n23 June 1996 (1996-06-23)\n15:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Croatia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Klinsmann ![](image) 20' (pen.)\n* Sammer ![](image) 59'\n | Report | * Šuker ![](image) 51'\n |\n\nOld Trafford, Manchester\nAttendance: 43,412[20]\nReferee: Leif Sundell (Sweden)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n23 June 1996 (1996-06-23)\n18:30\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA terrorist attack took place in Manchester on 15 June, one day before the group stage match between Germany and Russia was due to take place in the same city.[45] The detonation of a van bomb in the city centre injured 212 people and caused an estimated £700 million worth of damage. Four days after the blast, the Provisional Irish Republican Army issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility, but regretted causing injury to civilians.[46]\n\n\nThe Manchester bombing was the first and so far only major terrorist attack in the host city of an ongoing UEFA European Championship. The scheduled match at Old Trafford on the day following the bombing went ahead as planned after the stadium had been heavily guarded overnight and carefully searched; the game, in which Germany defeated Russia 3–0, was watched by a near capacity crowd of 50,700.\n\n\n\n### Empty seats[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter England's defeat to Germany in the semi-finals, a large-scale riot took place in Trafalgar Square and the surrounding area. Further outbreaks of trouble occurred in the streets of several other towns. The police and German-made cars were targeted, with damage also caused to various other properties.[48] A Russian student was stabbed in Brighton after attackers mistook him for being German.[49]\n\n\nDespite this outbreak, the tournament overall was free of hooliganism, helping rehabilitate England's reputation after their fans' conduct during the previous decades.[48] UEFA's awarding of the tournament to England was in itself a further step in bringing the country back fully into the international fold, coming soon after their decision in 1990 to re-admit English clubs back into UEFA competitions after the indefinite ban issued to them following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.[50][51]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Shaw, Phil (17 June 1996). \"Euro '96: Suker sinks Denmark\". *The Independent*.

It was also the first major tournament in which the reunified Germany (who were beaten 2–0 by Denmark in the final) had competed.\n\n\nIt was the last tournament with only eight participants, to award the winner of a match with only two points, and before the introduction of the back-pass rule, the latter of which was brought in immediately after the tournament was completed. When the next competition was held in 1996, 16 teams were involved and were awarded three points for a win.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nOn 16 December 1988, following a decision made by the UEFA Executive Committee, Sweden was chosen over Spain to host the event.[2] Spain was at a disadvantage as they had already been chosen to host the EXPO 1992 in Seville and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.[2][3]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nSeven of the eight teams had to qualify for the final stage; Sweden qualified automatically as hosts of the event.[4] The Soviet Union qualified for the final tournament shortly before the break-up of the country, and took part in the tournament under the banner of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),[5] before the former Soviet republics formed their own national teams after the competition. The CIS team represented the following former Soviet nations: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Tajikistan. Four out of 15 ex-republics were not members of the CIS: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania did not send their players; Georgia was not a member of the CIS at the time, but Georgian Kakhaber Tskhadadze was a part of the squad.\n\n\nOriginally, Yugoslavia qualified for the final stage and were about to participate as FR Yugoslavia, but due to the Yugoslav Wars, the team was disqualified and Denmark, as the runners-up from Yugoslavia's qualifying group, was invited to take part instead.[6] After a draw with England and a loss to host nation Sweden, Denmark beat France in their final group match to qualify for the semi-finals, where they would face the reigning European champions, the Netherlands. Denmark led 2–1 going into the last five minutes, but a Frank Rijkaard equaliser meant the game went to a penalty shoot-out; Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel saved Marco van Basten's kick, giving Denmark a 5–4 win on penalties and a place in the final against reigning world champions Germany.[7] Denmark won the final 2–0 with goals from John Jensen and Kim Vilfort in either half to claim their first European title.[8]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying\n\nScotland and the hosts Sweden made their respective debuts despite having already made many appearances at the World Cup. France qualified for the first Euro in which they were not the hosts. They played after missing the previous tournament.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time the Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia), Italy, Portugal and Spain failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Host | 16 December 1988 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group 1 winner | 12 October 1991 | 2 (*1960*, ***1984***)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group 7 winner | 13 November 1991 | 3 (1968, 1980, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) CIS[B] | Group 3 winner[C] | 13 November 1991 | 5 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Group 2 winner | 13 November 1991 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[D] | Group 5 winner | 20 November 1991 | 5 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Group 6 winner | 4 December 1991 | 3 (1976, 1980, **1988**)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 4 runner-up[E] | 31 May 1992 | 3 (1964, 1984, 1988)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1960 to 1988, CIS competed as the Soviet Union.\n3. **^** Replaced the Soviet Union.\n4. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n5. **^** Replaced FR Yugoslavia (after qualifying as Yugoslavia), who were subject to sanctions under UN Security Council Resolution 757 and thus banned from appearing.[9]\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 17 January 1992 in Gothenburg. Only two teams were seeded: Sweden (as hosts) and the Netherlands (as holders).[10][11] The remaining six teams were all unseeded and could be drawn in any group. Months after the draw, Yugoslavia was banned from participating and replaced by Denmark, which had come second in the qualifying group.\n\n\nIn the draw procedure, the unseeded teams were drawn one by one. The first two were placed in position 4 of each group, the next two in position 3, and the last 2 in position 2. The two seeded teams were then drawn and placed consecutively into position 1 of the groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pot 1: Seeded teams\n | Pot 2: Unseeded teams\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) Sweden (hosts)[a]\n* ![](image) Netherlands (holders)[b]\n | * ![](image) CIS\n* ![](image) England\n | * ![](image) France\n* ![](image) Germany\n | * ![](image) Scotland\n* ~~![](image) Yugoslavia~~[c]\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Hosts Sweden were automatically assigned to position A1.\n2. **^** Defending champions the Netherlands were automatically assigned to position B1.\n3. **^** Yugoslavia were to participate in the final tournament as FR Yugoslavia. However, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was placed under sanctions on 30 May 1992 by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 after the outbreak of Yugoslav Wars.[9] FIFA and UEFA therefore suspended FR Yugoslavia from competitive football on 31 May 1992, meaning they could not participate in the final tournament. Denmark instead took the spot at the final tournament.\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| A2 | ![](image) France |\n| A3 | ~~![](image) Yugoslavia~~ → ![](image) Denmark |\n| A4 | ![](image) England |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| B2 | ![](image) Scotland |\n| B3 | ![](image) CIS |\n| B4 | ![](image) Germany |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Gothenburg | ![UEFA Euro 1992 is located in Sweden](image)![Gothenburg](image)\nGothenburg\n![Stockholm](image)\nStockholm\n![Malmö](image)\nMalmö\n![Norrköping](image)\nNorrköping\n | Stockholm |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ullevi | Råsunda Stadium |\n| Capacity: **44,000** | Capacity: **40,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Malmö | Norrköping |\n| Malmö Stadion | Idrottsparken |\n| Capacity: **30,000** | Capacity: **23,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1992 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Match ball[edit]\n\n\nAdidas Etrusco Unico was used as the official match ball of the tournament.

It was the ninth UEFA European Championship, which is held every four years and supported by UEFA.\n\n\nDenmark won the 1992 championship, having qualified only after Yugoslavia was disqualified as a result of the breakup of the country and the ensuing warfare there. Eight national teams contested the final tournament.[1]\n\n\nThe CIS national football team (Commonwealth of Independent States), representing the recently dissolved Soviet Union, whose national team had qualified for the tournament, were present at the tournament. It was also the first major tournament in which the reunified Germany (who were beaten 2–0 by Denmark in the final) had competed.\n\n\nIt was the last tournament with only eight participants, to award the winner of a match with only two points, and before the introduction of the back-pass rule, the latter of which was brought in immediately after the tournament was completed. When the next competition was held in 1996, 16 teams were involved and were awarded three points for a win.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nOn 16 December 1988, following a decision made by the UEFA Executive Committee, Sweden was chosen over Spain to host the event.[2] Spain was at a disadvantage as they had already been chosen to host the EXPO 1992 in Seville and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.[2][3]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nSeven of the eight teams had to qualify for the final stage; Sweden qualified automatically as hosts of the event.[4] The Soviet Union qualified for the final tournament shortly before the break-up of the country, and took part in the tournament under the banner of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),[5] before the former Soviet republics formed their own national teams after the competition. The CIS team represented the following former Soviet nations: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Tajikistan. Four out of 15 ex-republics were not members of the CIS: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania did not send their players; Georgia was not a member of the CIS at the time, but Georgian Kakhaber Tskhadadze was a part of the squad.\n\n\nOriginally, Yugoslavia qualified for the final stage and were about to participate as FR Yugoslavia, but due to the Yugoslav Wars, the team was disqualified and Denmark, as the runners-up from Yugoslavia's qualifying group, was invited to take part instead.[6] After a draw with England and a loss to host nation Sweden, Denmark beat France in their final group match to qualify for the semi-finals, where they would face the reigning European champions, the Netherlands. Denmark led 2–1 going into the last five minutes, but a Frank Rijkaard equaliser meant the game went to a penalty shoot-out; Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel saved Marco van Basten's kick, giving Denmark a 5–4 win on penalties and a place in the final against reigning world champions Germany.[7] Denmark won the final 2–0 with goals from John Jensen and Kim Vilfort in either half to claim their first European title.[8]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying\n\nScotland and the hosts Sweden made their respective debuts despite having already made many appearances at the World Cup. France qualified for the first Euro in which they were not the hosts. They played after missing the previous tournament.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time the Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia), Italy, Portugal and Spain failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Host | 16 December 1988 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group 1 winner | 12 October 1991 | 2 (*1960*, ***1984***)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group 7 winner | 13 November 1991 | 3 (1968, 1980, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) CIS[B] | Group 3 winner[C] | 13 November 1991 | 5 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Group 2 winner | 13 November 1991 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[D] | Group 5 winner | 20 November 1991 | 5 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Group 6 winner | 4 December 1991 | 3 (1976, 1980, **1988**)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 4 runner-up[E] | 31 May 1992 | 3 (1964, 1984, 1988)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1960 to 1988, CIS competed as the Soviet Union.\n3. **^** Replaced the Soviet Union.\n4. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n5. **^** Replaced FR Yugoslavia (after qualifying as Yugoslavia), who were subject to sanctions under UN Security Council Resolution 757 and thus banned from appearing.[9]\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 17 January 1992 in Gothenburg. Only two teams were seeded: Sweden (as hosts) and the Netherlands (as holders).[10][11] The remaining six teams were all unseeded and could be drawn in any group. Months after the draw, Yugoslavia was banned from participating and replaced by Denmark, which had come second in the qualifying group.\n\n\nIn the draw procedure, the unseeded teams were drawn one by one. The first two were placed in position 4 of each group, the next two in position 3, and the last 2 in position 2. The two seeded teams were then drawn and placed consecutively into position 1 of the groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pot 1: Seeded teams\n | Pot 2: Unseeded teams\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) Sweden (hosts)[a]\n* ![](image) Netherlands (holders)[b]\n | * ![](image) CIS\n* ![](image) England\n | * ![](image) France\n* ![](image) Germany\n | * ![](image) Scotland\n* ~~![](image) Yugoslavia~~[c]\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Hosts Sweden were automatically assigned to position A1.\n2. **^** Defending champions the Netherlands were automatically assigned to position B1.\n3. **^** Yugoslavia were to participate in the final tournament as FR Yugoslavia. However, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was placed under sanctions on 30 May 1992 by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 after the outbreak of Yugoslav Wars.[9] FIFA and UEFA therefore suspended FR Yugoslavia from competitive football on 31 May 1992, meaning they could not participate in the final tournament. Denmark instead took the spot at the final tournament.\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| A2 | ![](image) France |\n| A3 | ~~![](image) Yugoslavia~~ → ![](image) Denmark |\n| A4 | ![](image) England |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| B2 | ![](image) Scotland |\n| B3 | ![](image) CIS |\n| B4 | ![](image) Germany |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Gothenburg | ![UEFA Euro 1992 is located in Sweden](image)![Gothenburg](image)\nGothenburg\n![Stockholm](image)\nStockholm\n![Malmö](image)\nMalmö\n![Norrköping](image)\nNorrköping\n | Stockholm |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ullevi | Råsunda Stadium |\n| Capacity: **44,000** | Capacity: **40,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Malmö | Norrköping |\n| Malmö Stadion | Idrottsparken |\n| Capacity: **30,000** | Capacity: **23,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1992 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Match ball[edit]\n\n\nAdidas Etrusco Unico was used as the official match ball of the tournament.

It was the eighth UEFA European Championship, which is held every four years and supported by UEFA.\n\n\nFrance were the defending champions, but failed to qualify. \n\n\nThe tournament crowned the Netherlands as European champions for the first time. Euro 88 was a rare instance of a major football tournament ending without a single sending-off or goalless draw, nor any knockout matches going to extra time or penalties. Euro 1988 was the final European Championship to see teams from West Germany and the Soviet Union, as the West and East Germans reunified to become Germany in 1990, and the Soviet Union disintegrated into 15 separate countries in 1991.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nWest Germany won the right to host the tournament with five votes ahead of a joint bid from Norway, Sweden and Denmark, which earned one vote, and a bid from England.[1]\n\n\nBecause the Eastern Bloc disagreed that West Berlin was part of the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Football Association ruled out playing Championship matches in West Berlin. This secured the participation of Eastern European members of UEFA.[*citation needed*] In the 1974 FIFA World Cup, however, West Berlin had hosted three games.\n\n\nAs a compromise, Berlin Olympic Stadium did host a Four Nations Tournament in 1988, with West Germany playing against the Soviet Union, Argentina and Sweden.[2]\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe first group pitted two pre-tournament favourites West Germany and Italy together, along with Spain and Denmark. The West German team had won the 1980 European Championship and were the runners-up in each of the last two World Cups in 1982 and 1986, although in 1984 they failed to qualify from their group. With such results and additionally as the host they were commonly considered the main favourite of the tournament.\n\n\nThe Italians had not played at Euro 1984, though they had finished fourth in the 1980 tournament, for which they were the hosts; they had also won the 1982 World Cup, albeit followed by a middling performance in 1986. Spain and Denmark contested the second semi-final of the 1984 edition, in which Spain prevailed on penalty-kicks, but then lost the final to hosts, France (who failed to qualify in 1988). Both Spain and Denmark played in the 1986 World Cup, and met there again, in a Round of 16 match of the knockout stage which Spain won 5–1.\n\n\nThe Germans and Italians played out the opening game. This game was tightly contested. Roberto Mancini capitalised on a defensive error on the left-hand side of the German goal and the striker squeezed in a shot from a tight angle low to the left corner. Just three minutes later, Italy's goalkeeper, Walter Zenga was penalised for taking more than four steps with the ball and Andreas Brehme scored the resulting free-kick from the edge of the penalty area with a low shot to the right corner. Both teams settled for a 1–1 draw.\n\n\nSpain defeated Denmark again, this time 3–2. Míchel opened the scoring after five minutes with a shot to the left corner from inside the penalty area and Michael Laudrup equalised 20 minutes later with a left foot shot from the edge of the penalty area to the left corner. Spain dominated the next hour and Emilio Butragueño scored with a low shot through the goalkeepers legs and then Rafael Gordillo putting the Spanish 3–1 to the good with a free-kick which deceived the goalkeeper. A late surge saw Flemming Povlsen reduce the scoreline with a header in off the left post, but was not enough for the Danes, who now needed to win both their remaining games to be certain of a place in the semi-finals.\n\n\nIn the remaining games the West Germans swept aside the Danes and Spanish. Jürgen Klinsmann and Olaf Thon scored to dispatch the former 2–0 while two goals from Rudi Völler were enough to beat Spain 2–0. The second goal was particularly notable. Lothar Matthäus ran 40 yards into the Spanish penalty box before back-heeling the ball for the oncoming Völler, following up his run, to strike the ball with the outside of his foot and into the corner of the goal.\n\n\nThe Italians won a difficult match against the Spanish 1–0, courtesy of a goal from Gianluca Vialli, a low cross-shot to the net on 73 minutes. In the last game, against an already eliminated Denmark, the Italians prevailed 2–0.\n\n\nThe second group witnessed a surprising set of results. In the opening game, one of the pre-tournament favourites England lost 1–0 to Ireland. Ray Houghton scored a looping header after six minutes after the English defence failed to clear a cross. The English applied strong pressure as the game wore on. Gary Lineker was unusually sluggish, missing a series of chances and hitting the crossbar – he was later diagnosed with hepatitis B.[3] In the other opening game, the Soviet Union defeated the Netherlands 1–0 through a Vasyl Rats goal, despite the Dutch dominating for long periods.\n\n\nEngland met the Netherlands in Düsseldorf; both needed to win. England started strongly with Lineker hitting a post and Glenn Hoddle striking the post with a free-kick. The English defence, weakened by the absence of Terry Butcher, conceded the first of three goals to Marco van Basten on 44 minutes. Van Basten turned Butcher's replacement Tony Adams and beat Peter Shilton – playing his 100th game for England – to give his side a 1–0 lead. England rallied after the break. Lineker and Bryan Robson exchanged a kick one-two pass allowing Robson to burst into the box and lift the ball over Hans van Breukelen after 53 minutes. The score remained until Van Basten turned Tony Adams inside out to finish from 18 yards on 71 minutes. The striker pounced from close-range after a corner to seal a 3–1 win four minutes later.\n\n\nThe Irish and Soviets led the group after two games through a 1–1 draw in Hanover. Ronnie Whelan scored a spectacular left-foot volley from 18 yards to put the Irish into the lead. Oleh Protasov equalised with a low shot as the Soviets exerted late pressure.\n\n\nNeeding to defeat the Irish to progress, the Dutch won the game 1–0 through a late Wim Kieft goal. The ball deflected into his path and he delivered a looping header which spun into the right corner of the Irish net with nine minutes remaining just after Paul McGrath hit a Dutch post with a header. In the other game, the Soviets soundly thrashed England. A mistake from Hoddle allowed Sergei Aleinikov to score after three minutes. Adams equalised and England had chances to go ahead, but a goal before half-time and late in the game assured the Soviet Union would finish in first place in the group.[4]\n\n\n\n### Semi-finals and final[edit]\n\n\nThe first semi-final was significant as rivals West Germany played the Netherlands. It was only the third time the two sides had faced each other since the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final; the West Germans winning a first round match in the 1980 European Championship, and a 2–2 draw in a 1978 FIFA World Cup second round group match. The game was tight, and the West Germans broke the deadlock on 55 minutes with a Matthäus penalty after a foul on Klinsmann. The lead was held for 20 minutes until Jürgen Kohler brought down Van Basten. Ronald Koeman converted the spot-kick to level the match. With the match headed for extra time, a through ball caught the Germans out and Van Basten finished clinically with a shot as he slid along the floor, beating the goalkeeper and Kohler to the ball in the 88th minute for a 2–1 win. It gave the Dutch their first competitive victory against the Germans and the first appearance in the competition's final. The victory was marred by the reaction of Dutch defender Koeman who wiped the shirt of Olaf Thon, given to him after the match, on his backside in front of the German fans. The player apologised afterwards.\n\n\nThe other semi-final was another unpredictable result. Italy were strong favourites to reach the final and had beaten the Soviets 4–1 in a friendly just two months earlier. Despite controlling the play and having the majority of the chances, the Italians were undone by poor finishing and a strong, tough opposition who sought to stop their more skilful opponents from playing through hard tackles and a defensive strategy. The hard work-rate of the Soviets paid off and in just four second-half minutes, counter-attacks saw two goals from Hennadiy Lytovchenko and Oleg Protasov. The first one from Lytovchenko was initially blocked, but with quick reactions he beat Franco Baresi to the ball to fire the second shot into the far corner. The second from Protasov was a looping shot that floated over Zenga for a 2–0 victory. It would be the Soviet Union's fourth appearance in a European Championship final.\n\n\nThe final was played on 25 June between the Soviet Union, in what would turn out to be the nation's last European Championship match, and the Netherlands at the Olympiastadion in Munich. The Dutch won the match 2–0, with goals by captain Ruud Gullit and tournament top scorer Marco van Basten. Hans van Breukelen blocked a low penalty shot of Igor Belanov. Van Basten's goal, a sharply hit volley across the goal off an incoming looping pass, would later be described as one of the greatest goals in the history of the European Championships.[5][6]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nSeven countries had to qualify for the final stage. West Germany qualified automatically as hosts of the event. The Republic of Ireland qualified for the first time for any major tournament. The holders, France, failed to qualify despite finishing third in the 1986 World Cup. As of 2024, this is the last time that France failed to qualify for the European Championship finals, and since the conversion to a group stage in the finals tournament, this remains the only time the previous tournament winners failed to qualify for the next competition.[7] Other notable absentees were Belgium (the 1980 runners-up and 1986 FIFA World Cup semi-finalists) and Portugal (semi-finalists of Euro 1984). The following eight teams qualified for the final tournament:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances  in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Host | 14 March 1985 | 4 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 6 winner | 14 October 1987 | 2 (1964, 1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Soviet Union | Group 3 winner | 28 October 1987 | 4 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group 4 winner | 11 November 1987 | 2 (1968, 1980)\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of Ireland | Group 7 winner | 11 November 1987 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Group 2 winner | 14 November 1987 | 2 (***1968***, *1980*)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group 1 winner | 18 November 1987 | 3 (***1964***, 1980, 1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Group 5 winner | 9 December 1987 | 2 (1976, 1980)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| ![UEFA Euro 1988 is located in FRG and West Berlin](image)![Munich](image)\nMunich\n![Gelsenkirchen](image)\nGelsenkirchen\n![Hamburg](image)\nHamburg\n![Frankfurt](image)\nFrankfurt\n![Düsseldorf](image)\nDüsseldorf\n![Hanover](image)\nHanover\n![Stuttgart](image)\nStuttgart\n![Cologne](image)\nCologne\n | Munich | Gelsenkirchen |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Olympiastadion | Parkstadion |\n| Capacity: **69,256** | Capacity: **70,748** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Hamburg | Frankfurt |\n| Volksparkstadion | Waldstadion |\n| Capacity: **61,330** | Capacity: **61,056** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Düsseldorf | Hanover | Stuttgart | Cologne |\n| Rheinstadion | Niedersachsenstadion | Neckarstadion | Müngersdorfer Stadion |\n| Capacity: **68,400** | Capacity: **60,366** | Capacity: **70,705** | Capacity: **60,584** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1988 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Special stamp issued by Deutsche Bundespost for the tournament\n\n\n| Country\n | Referee\n | Linesmen\n | Matches refereed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Austria | Horst Brummeier | Heinz Holzmann | Helmut Kohl | Republic of Ireland–Netherlands (group 2) |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Alexis Ponnet | Frans Van Den Wijngaert | Jean-François Crucke | Soviet Union–Italy (semi-finals) |\n| ![](image) East Germany | Siegfried Kirschen | Klaus Peschel | Manfred Roßner | England–Republic of Ireland (group 2) |\n| ![](image) England | Keith Hackett | Neil Midgley | Brian Hill | West Germany–Italy (group 1) |\n| ![](image) France | Michel Vautrot | Gérard Biguet | Rémi Harrel | West Germany–Spain (group 1)Soviet Union–Netherlands (final) |\n| ![](image) Italy | Paolo Casarin | Carlo Longhi | Pierluigi Magni | England–Netherlands (group 2) |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Bep Thomas | John Blankenstein | Jacob van der Niet | Denmark–Spain (group 1) |\n| ![](image) Portugal | José Rosa dos Santos | José Francisco Conceição Silva | Fortunato Alves de Azevedo | England–Soviet Union (group 2) |\n| ![](image) Romania | Ioan Igna | Ștefan Dan Petrescu | Ion Crăciunescu | West Germany–Netherlands (semi-finals) |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Bob Valentine | Kenny Hope | Andrew Waddell | West Germany–Denmark (group 1) |\n| ![](image) Spain | Emilio Soriano Aladrén | José Donato Pes Pérez | José Mauro Socorro González | Republic of Ireland–Soviet Union (group 2) |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Erik Fredriksson | Bo Karlsson | Christer Drottz | Italy–Spain (group 1) |\n| ![](image) Switzerland | Bruno Galler | Renzo Peduzzi | Philippe Mercier | Italy–Denmark (group 1) |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Dieter Pauly | Karl-Heinz Tritschler | Aron Schmidhuber | Netherlands–Soviet Union (group 2) |\n\n\n**Fourth officials**\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(December 2019)*\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Fourth officials\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Poland | Michał Listkiewicz |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Karl-Josef Assenmacher |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Werner Föckler |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Wolf-Günter Wiesel |\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Results for UEFA Euro 1988 finalists\nThe teams finishing in the top two of each group progressed to the semi-finals.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:\n\n\n\n1.

It was the eighth UEFA European Championship, which is held every four years and supported by UEFA.\n\n\nFrance were the defending champions, but failed to qualify. \n\n\nThe tournament crowned the Netherlands as European champions for the first time. Euro 88 was a rare instance of a major football tournament ending without a single sending-off or goalless draw, nor any knockout matches going to extra time or penalties. Euro 1988 was the final European Championship to see teams from West Germany and the Soviet Union, as the West and East Germans reunified to become Germany in 1990, and the Soviet Union disintegrated into 15 separate countries in 1991.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nWest Germany won the right to host the tournament with five votes ahead of a joint bid from Norway, Sweden and Denmark, which earned one vote, and a bid from England.[1]\n\n\nBecause the Eastern Bloc disagreed that West Berlin was part of the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Football Association ruled out playing Championship matches in West Berlin. This secured the participation of Eastern European members of UEFA.[*citation needed*] In the 1974 FIFA World Cup, however, West Berlin had hosted three games.\n\n\nAs a compromise, Berlin Olympic Stadium did host a Four Nations Tournament in 1988, with West Germany playing against the Soviet Union, Argentina and Sweden.[2]\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe first group pitted two pre-tournament favourites West Germany and Italy together, along with Spain and Denmark. The West German team had won the 1980 European Championship and were the runners-up in each of the last two World Cups in 1982 and 1986, although in 1984 they failed to qualify from their group. With such results and additionally as the host they were commonly considered the main favourite of the tournament.\n\n\nThe Italians had not played at Euro 1984, though they had finished fourth in the 1980 tournament, for which they were the hosts; they had also won the 1982 World Cup, albeit followed by a middling performance in 1986. Spain and Denmark contested the second semi-final of the 1984 edition, in which Spain prevailed on penalty-kicks, but then lost the final to hosts, France (who failed to qualify in 1988). Both Spain and Denmark played in the 1986 World Cup, and met there again, in a Round of 16 match of the knockout stage which Spain won 5–1.\n\n\nThe Germans and Italians played out the opening game. This game was tightly contested. Roberto Mancini capitalised on a defensive error on the left-hand side of the German goal and the striker squeezed in a shot from a tight angle low to the left corner. Just three minutes later, Italy's goalkeeper, Walter Zenga was penalised for taking more than four steps with the ball and Andreas Brehme scored the resulting free-kick from the edge of the penalty area with a low shot to the right corner. Both teams settled for a 1–1 draw.\n\n\nSpain defeated Denmark again, this time 3–2. Míchel opened the scoring after five minutes with a shot to the left corner from inside the penalty area and Michael Laudrup equalised 20 minutes later with a left foot shot from the edge of the penalty area to the left corner. Spain dominated the next hour and Emilio Butragueño scored with a low shot through the goalkeepers legs and then Rafael Gordillo putting the Spanish 3–1 to the good with a free-kick which deceived the goalkeeper. A late surge saw Flemming Povlsen reduce the scoreline with a header in off the left post, but was not enough for the Danes, who now needed to win both their remaining games to be certain of a place in the semi-finals.\n\n\nIn the remaining games the West Germans swept aside the Danes and Spanish. Jürgen Klinsmann and Olaf Thon scored to dispatch the former 2–0 while two goals from Rudi Völler were enough to beat Spain 2–0. The second goal was particularly notable. Lothar Matthäus ran 40 yards into the Spanish penalty box before back-heeling the ball for the oncoming Völler, following up his run, to strike the ball with the outside of his foot and into the corner of the goal.\n\n\nThe Italians won a difficult match against the Spanish 1–0, courtesy of a goal from Gianluca Vialli, a low cross-shot to the net on 73 minutes. In the last game, against an already eliminated Denmark, the Italians prevailed 2–0.\n\n\nThe second group witnessed a surprising set of results. In the opening game, one of the pre-tournament favourites England lost 1–0 to Ireland. Ray Houghton scored a looping header after six minutes after the English defence failed to clear a cross. The English applied strong pressure as the game wore on. Gary Lineker was unusually sluggish, missing a series of chances and hitting the crossbar – he was later diagnosed with hepatitis B.[3] In the other opening game, the Soviet Union defeated the Netherlands 1–0 through a Vasyl Rats goal, despite the Dutch dominating for long periods.\n\n\nEngland met the Netherlands in Düsseldorf; both needed to win. England started strongly with Lineker hitting a post and Glenn Hoddle striking the post with a free-kick. The English defence, weakened by the absence of Terry Butcher, conceded the first of three goals to Marco van Basten on 44 minutes. Van Basten turned Butcher's replacement Tony Adams and beat Peter Shilton – playing his 100th game for England – to give his side a 1–0 lead. England rallied after the break. Lineker and Bryan Robson exchanged a kick one-two pass allowing Robson to burst into the box and lift the ball over Hans van Breukelen after 53 minutes. The score remained until Van Basten turned Tony Adams inside out to finish from 18 yards on 71 minutes. The striker pounced from close-range after a corner to seal a 3–1 win four minutes later.\n\n\nThe Irish and Soviets led the group after two games through a 1–1 draw in Hanover. Ronnie Whelan scored a spectacular left-foot volley from 18 yards to put the Irish into the lead. Oleh Protasov equalised with a low shot as the Soviets exerted late pressure.\n\n\nNeeding to defeat the Irish to progress, the Dutch won the game 1–0 through a late Wim Kieft goal. The ball deflected into his path and he delivered a looping header which spun into the right corner of the Irish net with nine minutes remaining just after Paul McGrath hit a Dutch post with a header. In the other game, the Soviets soundly thrashed England. A mistake from Hoddle allowed Sergei Aleinikov to score after three minutes. Adams equalised and England had chances to go ahead, but a goal before half-time and late in the game assured the Soviet Union would finish in first place in the group.[4]\n\n\n\n### Semi-finals and final[edit]\n\n\nThe first semi-final was significant as rivals West Germany played the Netherlands. It was only the third time the two sides had faced each other since the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final; the West Germans winning a first round match in the 1980 European Championship, and a 2–2 draw in a 1978 FIFA World Cup second round group match. The game was tight, and the West Germans broke the deadlock on 55 minutes with a Matthäus penalty after a foul on Klinsmann. The lead was held for 20 minutes until Jürgen Kohler brought down Van Basten. Ronald Koeman converted the spot-kick to level the match. With the match headed for extra time, a through ball caught the Germans out and Van Basten finished clinically with a shot as he slid along the floor, beating the goalkeeper and Kohler to the ball in the 88th minute for a 2–1 win. It gave the Dutch their first competitive victory against the Germans and the first appearance in the competition's final. The victory was marred by the reaction of Dutch defender Koeman who wiped the shirt of Olaf Thon, given to him after the match, on his backside in front of the German fans. The player apologised afterwards.\n\n\nThe other semi-final was another unpredictable result. Italy were strong favourites to reach the final and had beaten the Soviets 4–1 in a friendly just two months earlier. Despite controlling the play and having the majority of the chances, the Italians were undone by poor finishing and a strong, tough opposition who sought to stop their more skilful opponents from playing through hard tackles and a defensive strategy. The hard work-rate of the Soviets paid off and in just four second-half minutes, counter-attacks saw two goals from Hennadiy Lytovchenko and Oleg Protasov. The first one from Lytovchenko was initially blocked, but with quick reactions he beat Franco Baresi to the ball to fire the second shot into the far corner. The second from Protasov was a looping shot that floated over Zenga for a 2–0 victory. It would be the Soviet Union's fourth appearance in a European Championship final.\n\n\nThe final was played on 25 June between the Soviet Union, in what would turn out to be the nation's last European Championship match, and the Netherlands at the Olympiastadion in Munich. The Dutch won the match 2–0, with goals by captain Ruud Gullit and tournament top scorer Marco van Basten. Hans van Breukelen blocked a low penalty shot of Igor Belanov. Van Basten's goal, a sharply hit volley across the goal off an incoming looping pass, would later be described as one of the greatest goals in the history of the European Championships.[5][6]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nSeven countries had to qualify for the final stage. West Germany qualified automatically as hosts of the event. The Republic of Ireland qualified for the first time for any major tournament. The holders, France, failed to qualify despite finishing third in the 1986 World Cup. As of 2024, this is the last time that France failed to qualify for the European Championship finals, and since the conversion to a group stage in the finals tournament, this remains the only time the previous tournament winners failed to qualify for the next competition.[7] Other notable absentees were Belgium (the 1980 runners-up and 1986 FIFA World Cup semi-finalists) and Portugal (semi-finalists of Euro 1984).

It was the seventh UEFA European Championship, a competition held every four years and endorsed by UEFA.\n\n\nAt the time, only eight countries took part in the final stage of the tournament, seven of which had to come through the qualifying stage. France qualified automatically as hosts of the event; in the tournament led by Michel Platini, who scored nine goals in France's five matches, *Les Bleus* won the championship – their first major international title.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nThe hosting of the event was contested by bids from France and West Germany. The French bid was unanimously selected by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting on 10 December 1981.[2]\n\n\n\n## Tournament summary[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe opening game of tournament featured France and Denmark. The sides played out a very close encounter until Michel Platini's goal on 78 minutes gave the hosts a 1–0 victory. The opening game also saw a premature end to the tournament for Danish midfielder Allan Simonsen, who suffered a broken leg. Platini then scored hat-tricks against both Belgium and Yugoslavia as the French recorded maximum points in Group 1. Denmark took second place in the group with victories over Belgium and Yugoslavia, while Belgium finished third with two points. Yugoslavia, despite going out with no points, gave the hosts a fright in their last group game when they took a 1–0 lead into half-time and then reduced France's 3–1 lead to one goal six minutes from time. The games in Group 1 were unusually high-scoring, and featured 23 goals over the six matches.\n\n\nGroup 2 provided fewer goals, but produced a huge surprise as West Germany failed to qualify for the semi-finals after a 1–0 defeat in their last match to Spain with a late goal by Antonio Maceda, and a late Portugal win against Romania that sent the holders out.\n\n\n\n### Semi-finals and final[edit]\n\n\nThe first semi-final between France and Portugal is often considered one of the best matches in the history of the European Championship.[3] Jean-François Domergue opened the scoring for France but Portugal equalised through Rui Jordão on 74 minutes. The game went to extra time and Jordão scored again in the 98th minute to give the Portuguese a shock lead, but the French rallied and Domergue equalised with six minutes left. Then, in the dying moments of the match and with a penalty shoot-out looming, Platini scored his eighth goal of the championship to give France a memorable 3–2 victory.\n\n\nThe other semi-final between Spain and Denmark saw two evenly matched sides draw 1–1 after extra time, as Søren Lerby's goal after only seven minutes was cancelled out by Maceda’s strike an hour later. The match went to a penalty shoot-out, and Spain converted all five of their penalties to win 5–4 and reach the final for the first time since 1964.\n\n\nThe final was played to a capacity crowd at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Just before the hour mark, Platini scored from a free-kick to put France ahead following a mistake by Spanish goalkeeper Luis Arconada. France were reduced to ten players when Yvon Le Roux was sent off, but Spain were unable to equalise, and Bruno Bellone's goal in injury time made the final score 2–0. France had won their first major championship in world football.\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying\n\nPortugal and Romania made their debuts in the European Championship. France, the hosts and eventual winners, qualified for the first time since inaugural tournament in 1960, which they also hosted. Denmark qualified for the first time since 1964. Yugoslavia qualified after missing the 1980 tournament. Notable absentees were the 1982 FIFA World Cup winners and Euro 1980 hosts Italy, as well as 1966 World Cup winners England, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands (who failed to qualify for the last time until 2016) and Hungary. \n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) France | Host | 10 December 1981 | 1 (*1960*)\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Group 1 winner | 12 October 1983 | 2 (*1972*, 1980)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Group 2 winner | 1 November 1983 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 3 winner | 16 November 1983 | 1 (1964)\n |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Group 6 winner | 20 November 1983 | 3 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**)\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Group 5 winner | 30 November 1983 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Yugoslavia | Group 4 winner | 21 December 1983 | 3 (1960, 1968, *1976*)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group 7 winner | 21 December 1983 | 2 (***1964***, 1980)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\n### Tournament format[edit]\n\n\nAfter trying out several formats, UEFA finally developed for the 1984 tournament the format that would serve for all subsequent eight-team European Championships.[4] The eight qualified teams were split into two groups of four that played a round-robin schedule. The top two teams of each group advanced to semi-finals (reintroduced after being absent from the 1980 tournament) and the winners advanced to the final. The third place play-off, widely perceived as an unnecessary chore, was dropped. As usual at the time, a win was credited with two points only, teams on equal points were ranked by goal difference instead of head-to-head results, and the sudden-death rule in extra time did not apply.\n\n\nFixtures were scheduled according to an innovative rotation schedule in which each team played its three first-round matches in three different stadia. Host France, for instance, played in Paris, Nantes, and Saint-Étienne. This formula had the advantage of exposing residents of a given city to more teams but implied multiple and sometimes costly trips from town to town for fans who wanted to follow their side. In subsequent championships, the organisers reverted to conventional schedules in which teams played in one or two cities only.\n\n\n\n### Overall impressions[edit]\n\n\nVery few hooligan-related incidents were recorded throughout the tournament. Only one minor instance of fan trouble was recorded, in Strasbourg around the West Germany vs. Portugal match. The small group of German hooligans responsible for the incidents was arrested and deported back to West Germany on the same day using a new law specially passed by the French Parliament ahead of the Euro. Overall, the organisation was flawless,[*citation needed*] a feat that established France's credentials as a host nation and eventually helped it win the right to stage the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nThe entire competition was marked by exceptionally fine weather which, along with the high quality of play throughout the tournament (a welcome change from the 1980 European Championship) and the absence of hooligans, contributed to a very positive and enjoyable experience for teams and fans alike.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe official mascot of this European Championship was **Peno**, a rooster, representing the emblem of the host nation, France. It has the number 84 on the left side of its chest and its outfit is the same as the France national team, blue shirt, white shorts and red socks.\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nFrance's winning bid to host the Euro was based on seven stadia. The 48,000-seat Parc des Princes in Paris was the venue for the opening match and the final. Built in 1972, it was still state-of-the-art in 1984 and needed minor improvements only. Marseille's Stade Vélodrome was expanded to 55,000 seats to host one semi-final and some group matches, becoming France's largest stadium on the occasion. Stade de Gerland in Lyon, the venue for the other semi-final and some group matches as well, was thoroughly renovated and expanded to 40,000. Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Étienne and Stade Félix-Bollaert in Lens were the other existing stadia that hosted group matches and were expanded to 53,000 and 49,000, respectively. Lastly, two all-new stadia were built to host group matches (and subsequently provided worthy home grounds for the traditionally strong local club teams): Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes (53,000) was built on an entirely new site while Stade de la Meinau in Strasbourg was rebuilt from the ground up on the site of the old stadium into a modern 40,000-seat arena.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Paris | Marseille | Lyon |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Parc des Princes | Stade Vélodrome | Stade de Gerland |\n| Capacity: **48,360** | Capacity: **55,000** | Capacity: **51,860** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| ![UEFA Euro 1984 is located in France](image)![Paris](image)\nParis\n![Marseille](image)\nMarseille\n![Lyon](image)\nLyon\n![Saint-Étienne](image)\nSaint-Étienne\n![Lens](image)\nLens\n![Nantes](image)\nNantes\n![Strasbourg](image)\nStrasbourg\n | Saint-Étienne |\n| Stade Geoffroy-Guichard |\n| Capacity: **48,274** |\n| ![](image) |\n| Lens | Nantes | Strasbourg |\n| Stade Félix-Bollaert | Stade de la Beaujoire | Stade de la Meinau |\n| Capacity: **49,000** | Capacity: **52,923** | Capacity: **42,756** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n* ![Austria](image) Heinz Fahnler\n* ![Belgium](image) Alexis Ponnet\n* ![Czechoslovakia](image) Vojtech Christov\n* ![East Germany](image) Adolf Prokop\n* ![England](image) George Courtney\n* ![France](image) Michel Vautrot\n* ![Italy](image) Paolo Bergamo\n* ![Netherlands](image) Jan Keizer\n* ![Scotland](image) Bob Valentine\n* ![Spain](image) Augusto Lamo Castillo\n* ![Soviet Union](image) Romualdas Juška\n* ![Sweden](image) Erik Fredriksson\n* ![Switzerland](image) André Daina\n* ![West Germany](image) Volker Roth\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1984 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1984 UEFA European Championship finalists.\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the two groups progress to the semi-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated from the tournament.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:\n\n\n\n1.

It was the seventh UEFA European Championship, a competition held every four years and endorsed by UEFA.\n\n\nAt the time, only eight countries took part in the final stage of the tournament, seven of which had to come through the qualifying stage. France qualified automatically as hosts of the event; in the tournament led by Michel Platini, who scored nine goals in France's five matches, *Les Bleus* won the championship – their first major international title.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nThe hosting of the event was contested by bids from France and West Germany. The French bid was unanimously selected by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting on 10 December 1981.[2]\n\n\n\n## Tournament summary[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe opening game of tournament featured France and Denmark. The sides played out a very close encounter until Michel Platini's goal on 78 minutes gave the hosts a 1–0 victory. The opening game also saw a premature end to the tournament for Danish midfielder Allan Simonsen, who suffered a broken leg. Platini then scored hat-tricks against both Belgium and Yugoslavia as the French recorded maximum points in Group 1. Denmark took second place in the group with victories over Belgium and Yugoslavia, while Belgium finished third with two points. Yugoslavia, despite going out with no points, gave the hosts a fright in their last group game when they took a 1–0 lead into half-time and then reduced France's 3–1 lead to one goal six minutes from time. The games in Group 1 were unusually high-scoring, and featured 23 goals over the six matches.\n\n\nGroup 2 provided fewer goals, but produced a huge surprise as West Germany failed to qualify for the semi-finals after a 1–0 defeat in their last match to Spain with a late goal by Antonio Maceda, and a late Portugal win against Romania that sent the holders out.\n\n\n\n### Semi-finals and final[edit]\n\n\nThe first semi-final between France and Portugal is often considered one of the best matches in the history of the European Championship.[3] Jean-François Domergue opened the scoring for France but Portugal equalised through Rui Jordão on 74 minutes. The game went to extra time and Jordão scored again in the 98th minute to give the Portuguese a shock lead, but the French rallied and Domergue equalised with six minutes left. Then, in the dying moments of the match and with a penalty shoot-out looming, Platini scored his eighth goal of the championship to give France a memorable 3–2 victory.\n\n\nThe other semi-final between Spain and Denmark saw two evenly matched sides draw 1–1 after extra time, as Søren Lerby's goal after only seven minutes was cancelled out by Maceda’s strike an hour later. The match went to a penalty shoot-out, and Spain converted all five of their penalties to win 5–4 and reach the final for the first time since 1964.\n\n\nThe final was played to a capacity crowd at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Just before the hour mark, Platini scored from a free-kick to put France ahead following a mistake by Spanish goalkeeper Luis Arconada. France were reduced to ten players when Yvon Le Roux was sent off, but Spain were unable to equalise, and Bruno Bellone's goal in injury time made the final score 2–0. France had won their first major championship in world football.\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying\n\nPortugal and Romania made their debuts in the European Championship. France, the hosts and eventual winners, qualified for the first time since inaugural tournament in 1960, which they also hosted. Denmark qualified for the first time since 1964. Yugoslavia qualified after missing the 1980 tournament. Notable absentees were the 1982 FIFA World Cup winners and Euro 1980 hosts Italy, as well as 1966 World Cup winners England, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands (who failed to qualify for the last time until 2016) and Hungary. \n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) France | Host | 10 December 1981 | 1 (*1960*)\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Group 1 winner | 12 October 1983 | 2 (*1972*, 1980)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Group 2 winner | 1 November 1983 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 3 winner | 16 November 1983 | 1 (1964)\n |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Group 6 winner | 20 November 1983 | 3 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**)\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Group 5 winner | 30 November 1983 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Yugoslavia | Group 4 winner | 21 December 1983 | 3 (1960, 1968, *1976*)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group 7 winner | 21 December 1983 | 2 (***1964***, 1980)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\n### Tournament format[edit]\n\n\nAfter trying out several formats, UEFA finally developed for the 1984 tournament the format that would serve for all subsequent eight-team European Championships.[4] The eight qualified teams were split into two groups of four that played a round-robin schedule. The top two teams of each group advanced to semi-finals (reintroduced after being absent from the 1980 tournament) and the winners advanced to the final. The third place play-off, widely perceived as an unnecessary chore, was dropped. As usual at the time, a win was credited with two points only, teams on equal points were ranked by goal difference instead of head-to-head results, and the sudden-death rule in extra time did not apply.\n\n\nFixtures were scheduled according to an innovative rotation schedule in which each team played its three first-round matches in three different stadia. Host France, for instance, played in Paris, Nantes, and Saint-Étienne. This formula had the advantage of exposing residents of a given city to more teams but implied multiple and sometimes costly trips from town to town for fans who wanted to follow their side. In subsequent championships, the organisers reverted to conventional schedules in which teams played in one or two cities only.\n\n\n\n### Overall impressions[edit]\n\n\nVery few hooligan-related incidents were recorded throughout the tournament. Only one minor instance of fan trouble was recorded, in Strasbourg around the West Germany vs. Portugal match. The small group of German hooligans responsible for the incidents was arrested and deported back to West Germany on the same day using a new law specially passed by the French Parliament ahead of the Euro. Overall, the organisation was flawless,[*citation needed*] a feat that established France's credentials as a host nation and eventually helped it win the right to stage the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nThe entire competition was marked by exceptionally fine weather which, along with the high quality of play throughout the tournament (a welcome change from the 1980 European Championship) and the absence of hooligans, contributed to a very positive and enjoyable experience for teams and fans alike.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe official mascot of this European Championship was **Peno**, a rooster, representing the emblem of the host nation, France. It has the number 84 on the left side of its chest and its outfit is the same as the France national team, blue shirt, white shorts and red socks.\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nFrance's winning bid to host the Euro was based on seven stadia. The 48,000-seat Parc des Princes in Paris was the venue for the opening match and the final. Built in 1972, it was still state-of-the-art in 1984 and needed minor improvements only. Marseille's Stade Vélodrome was expanded to 55,000 seats to host one semi-final and some group matches, becoming France's largest stadium on the occasion. Stade de Gerland in Lyon, the venue for the other semi-final and some group matches as well, was thoroughly renovated and expanded to 40,000. Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Étienne and Stade Félix-Bollaert in Lens were the other existing stadia that hosted group matches and were expanded to 53,000 and 49,000, respectively. Lastly, two all-new stadia were built to host group matches (and subsequently provided worthy home grounds for the traditionally strong local club teams): Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes (53,000) was built on an entirely new site while Stade de la Meinau in Strasbourg was rebuilt from the ground up on the site of the old stadium into a modern 40,000-seat arena.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Paris | Marseille | Lyon |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Parc des Princes | Stade Vélodrome | Stade de Gerland |\n| Capacity: **48,360** | Capacity: **55,000** | Capacity: **51,860** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| ![UEFA Euro 1984 is located in France](image)![Paris](image)\nParis\n![Marseille](image)\nMarseille\n![Lyon](image)\nLyon\n![Saint-Étienne](image)\nSaint-Étienne\n![Lens](image)\nLens\n![Nantes](image)\nNantes\n![Strasbourg](image)\nStrasbourg\n | Saint-Étienne |\n| Stade Geoffroy-Guichard |\n| Capacity: **48,274** |\n| ![](image) |\n| Lens | Nantes | Strasbourg |\n| Stade Félix-Bollaert | Stade de la Beaujoire | Stade de la Meinau |\n| Capacity: **49,000** | Capacity: **52,923** | Capacity: **42,756** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n* ![Austria](image) Heinz Fahnler\n* ![Belgium](image) Alexis Ponnet\n* ![Czechoslovakia](image) Vojtech Christov\n* ![East Germany](image) Adolf Prokop\n* ![England](image) George Courtney\n* ![France](image) Michel Vautrot\n* ![Italy](image) Paolo Bergamo\n* ![Netherlands](image) Jan Keizer\n* ![Scotland](image) Bob Valentine\n* ![Spain](image) Augusto Lamo Castillo\n* ![Soviet Union](image) Romualdas Juška\n* ![Sweden](image) Erik Fredriksson\n* ![Switzerland](image) André Daina\n* ![West Germany](image) Volker Roth\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1984 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1984 UEFA European Championship finalists.\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the two groups progress to the semi-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated from the tournament.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:\n\n\n\n1.
