For the current fires in California, see 2023 California wildfires.\n\n![](image)Santa Ana winds in California expand fires and spread smoke over hundreds of miles, as in this October 2007 satellite image\n![](image)The Rim Fire consumed more than 250,000 acres (100,000\u00a0ha) of forest near Yosemite National Park, in 2013\nThis is a partial and incomplete list of California wildfires. California has dry, windy, and often hot weather conditions from spring through late autumn that can produce moderate to severe wildfires. Pre-1800, when the area was much more forested and the ecology much more resilient, 4.4 million acres (1.8 million hectares) of forest and shrubland burned annually.[1] California land area totals 99,813,760 or roughly 100 million acres, so since 2000, the area that burned annually has ranged between 90,000 acres, or 0.09%, and 1,590,000 acres, or 1.59% of the total land of California.[2] During the 2020 wildfire season alone, over 8,100 fires contributed to the burning of nearly 4.5 million acres of land.\n\n\nWildfires in California are growing more dangerous because of the accumulation of wood fuel in forests, higher population and greater electricity transmission and distribution lines.[3][4][5] United States taxpayers pay about US$3 billion a year to fight wildfires, and big fires can lead to billions of dollars in property losses.[6] At times, these wildfires are fanned or made worse by strong, dry winds, known as Diablo winds when they occur in the northern part of the state and Santa Ana winds when they occur in the south. However, from a historical perspective, it has been estimated that prior to 1850, about 4.5 million acres (17,000 km\u00b2) burned yearly, in fires that lasted for months, with wildfire activity peaking roughly every 30 years, when up to 11.8 million acres (47,753 km\u00b3) of land burned.[7][8] The much larger wildfire seasons in the past can be attributed to the policy of Native Californians regularly setting controlled burns and allowing natural fires to run their course, which prevented devastating wildfires from overrunning the state.[7]\n\n\nMore than 350,000 people in California live in towns sited completely within zones deemed to be at very high risk of fire. In total, more than 2.7 million people live in \"very high fire hazard severity zones\", which also include areas at lesser risk.[9]\n\n\nOn lands under CAL FIRE's jurisdictional protection (i.e. not federal or local responsibility areas), the majority of wildfire ignitions since 1980 have been caused by humans. The four most common ignition sources for wildfires on CAL FIRE-protected lands are, in order: equipment use, powerlines, arson, and lightning.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

ignition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The summer 2008 wildfires were widespread and deadly, with at least 3,596 wildfires of various origins burning throughout Northern and Central California, for around four months\nIn some parts of California, fires can recur in areas with histories of fires. In Oakland, for example, fires of various size and ignition occurred in 1923, 1931, 1933, 1937, 1946, 1955, 1960, 1961, 1968, 1970, 1980, 1990, 1991, 1995, 2002, and 2008.[62][63] Orange County, Riverside County, San Bernardino County, and Los Angeles County are other examples. Orange and San Bernardino counties share a border that runs north to south through the Chino Hills State Park, with the park's landscape ranging from large green coastal sage scrub, grassland, and woodland, to areas of brown sparsely dense vegetation made drier by droughts or hot summers. The valley's grass and barren land can become easily susceptible to dry spells and drought, therefore making it a prime spot for brush fires and conflagrations, many of which have occurred since 1914. Hills and canyons have seen brush or wildfires in 1914, the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and into today.[64]\n\n\nOn occasion, lightning strikes from thunderstorms may also spark wildfires in areas that have seen past ignition. Examples of this are the 1999 Megram Fire, the 2008 California wildfires.[*citation needed*], as well as both the LNU and SCU Lightning Complex fires of 2020.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of wildfires\n* 2012\u201313 North American drought\n* Wildfires in the United States\n* Climate change in California\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Stephens, Scott L.; Martin, Robert E.; Clinton, Nicholas E.

According to statistics published by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), as of November\u00a013, 2023[update], a total of 7,477 fires have burned a total of 319,948 acres (129,478 hectares). This is below the state's five-year average of 1,602,757 acres (648,613\u00a0ha) burned during the same period.[1][2] The 2023 fire season follows the 2022 season, during which the number of fires and the resulting burned acreage were both below average.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Season outlook[edit]\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nCalifornia saw a series of powerful atmospheric rivers between December 2022 and March 2023, which much improved drought conditions in the state and boosted the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada to more than 200% of average for the date. Some researchers noted that the resulting vegetation growth could prove dangerous if dry and warm conditions return during spring and summer, obviating the gains from early storms,[4][5] but in general, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), increased precipitation reduces the risk of a worse wildfire season.[6]\n\n\nCal Fire predicted that \"critically dry fuel moisture alignments are not likely to be reached for any great length of time or over a larger area\" between March and June 2023.[1] Critical fuel moisture refers to the point at which fuel characteristics\u2014like vegetation mortality or dryness\u2014are favorable for large fire growth.[7][6][8]\n\n\n\n#### Timing of peak fire season[edit]\n\n\nIn Northern California, fire season typically peaks in the summer with increasingly warm and dry conditions and aided by occasional dry cold frontal passages that may bring winds and/or lightning. Activity usually continues until late fall brings Pacific moisture to the northern portion of the state, though northeast wind events may pose a threat. In Southern California, fire season typically peaks in late spring through early fall, when Pacific moisture recedes. Offshore wind events such as Santa Ana winds mean that large fires are possible year-round, but their frequency is most heightened in the fall, when fuels are also driest.[9]\n\n\n\n### Preparation[edit]\n\n\nIn January, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the allocation of $930 million in funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act to ten western states, including California, for fuel reduction programs and other measures to curtail wildfire risks. The allocation was reported to represent a significant increase in funding for programs like tree clearing, brush thinning and removal, and controlled burns in Southern California, whose four National Forests previously received about $1.2 million annually for those purposes.[10]\n\n\nOn January 31, California senators Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla (as well as senators Steve Daines of Montana and Ron Wyden of Oregon) introduced a bill to the U.S. Senate entitled the Wildfire Emergency Act, recognizing the \"threat of wildfire\" as an emergency in the Western United States. The proposed bill would provide at least a quarter of a billion dollars in funding for forest restoration and wildfire resilience in 20 locations of more than 100,000 acres (40,000\u00a0ha) each, coordinated by the Forest Service. It would also create a program at the Department of Energy to \"ensure that critical facilities remain active during wildfire disruptions\". Further funding would be provided for prescribed fire implementation, firefighter training, and wildfire detection.[11]\n\n\nOn March 20, Vice President Kamala Harris announced $197 million in federal grants through the administration\u2019s wildfire defense grant program. California-based authorities and organizations were slated to receive 29 grants; they include money for counties to conduct home defensible space inspections, prescribed burn training, and fuels reductions, as well as increased funding for U.S. Forest Service and Department of Interior wildfire prevention efforts.[12]\n\n\n\n## Impacts[edit]\n\n\n### Casualties[edit]\n\n\nWhile fighting the 3-acre (1.2\u00a0ha) Broadway Fire near Cabazon in Riverside County on August 6, two helicopters (a Bell 407 and a Sikorsky S-64E) collided in mid-air. The Sikorsky helicopter landed safely, while all three occupants of the Bell helicopter\u2014a contract pilot, a Cal Fire division chief, and a Cal Fire captain\u2014were killed. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will investigate the accident.[13][14]\n\n\n\n## List of wildfires[edit]\n\n\nThe following is a list of fires that have burned more than 1,000 acres (400 hectares), produced significant structural damage or casualties, or otherwise been notable.

By the end of the year, a total of 7,667 fires had been recorded, totaling approximately 363,939 acres (147,281 hectares) across the state. Wildfires killed nine people in California in 2022, destroyed 772 structures, and damaged another 104. The 2022 season followed the 2020 and 2021 California wildfire seasons, which had the highest and second-highest (respectively) numbers of acres burned in the historical record, with a sharp drop in acreage burned.\n\n\nDrastic climatic and ecological conditions, including climate change and long-term drought, had led to the anticipation of another potentially above-average wildfire season on the heels of two previous such seasons in 2020 and 2021.[2] However, while the number of fires to date in 2022 was only slightly below the 5-year average (7,641 fires versus 8,049 fires), the total acreage burned was well below the 5-year average; 363,939 acres burned in 2022 thus far versus the 5-year average of 2,324,096 acres (though that average includes several of California's most significant fire seasons).[3]\n\n\nPeak fire season in California typically occurs in late summer and/or fall, and effectively ends when significant precipitation occurs across the state.[4] Governor of California Gavin Newsom officially marked \"the end of peak wildfire season\u201d in most of the state in mid-November.[5] The quieter fire year was received gratefully by state officials and was highlighted by multiple news outlets, which attributed the downturn in severity largely to fortunate weather patterns, such as well-timed precipitation and favorable wind conditions.[6][5] Officials were also quick to suggest that a contributing factor might have been several billion dollars invested in wildfire resilience projects, such as prescribed burning and community outreach.[5]\n\n\nDespite the 'quiet' year as measured in acreage, a number of significant wildfires burned in California in 2022; these include the Oak Fire in Mariposa County, which burned over 180 structures, the McKinney Fire in Siskiyou County, which caused 4 fatalities, and the Mosquito Fire in Placer and El Dorado counties, which was California's largest wildfire of the year.\n\n\n\n\n## Early outlook[edit]\n\n\n### Seasonal fire risk[edit]\n\n\nAfter a wet October and December in the beginning of the 2022 water year, California experienced the driest January\u2013February period on record in the state, with similar conditions continuing in March.[7][8][9] This dry stretch follows a period of severe drought in the state that began in 2020, in part due to climate change in California,[10] and which contributed to severe wildfire seasons in both 2020 and 2021.\n\n\nIn its April monthly seasonal outlook, the National Interagency Fire Center forecast above normal significant fire potential for the Bay Area, Mid Coast-Mendocino, and Sacramento Valley/Foothill areas beginning in May, due to the lack of seasonal precipitation, early start to the growing season, and long-term drought.[11] It also noted that \"A further expansion of above normal significant fire potential is forecast across most elevations during June and July.\" The Northern California Geographic Coordination Center (commonly called 'North Ops') forecast stated that \"Confidence is moderate to high for an early start to the significant large fire season.\"[12]\n\n\nIn Northern California, peak fire season begins in the early summer (June-July) and runs until late fall, varying year to year. In Southern California, the peak fire season begins in late spring (May-June) and runs until fall.[13] The precise timing varies according to annual and seasonal precipitation, as well as the occurrence of offshore wind events, such as the Santa Anas, Diablo winds, or sundowner winds.[14] However, fires are possible at any time of year in the state, particularly in drier Southern California.\n\n\n\n### Preparation[edit]\n\n\nIn anticipation of the 2022 California wildfire season, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) increased its planned wildfire mitigation plan spending for 2022 to $5.96 billion, from $4.8 billion in 2021 and $4.46 billion in 2020.[15] The mitigation plan includes the 'undergrounding' of at least 175 miles of power lines in high-fire risk areas, the installation of 98 additional wildfire detection/monitoring cameras and 100 additional weather stations, the expansion of safety settings that cut off power when objects (such as trees or branches) contact power lines, and the continued implementation of public safety power shutoffs (PSPS) as a last resort during extreme fire weather conditions.[16][17] These moves came after the company declared bankruptcy in 2019 over its liability for wildfire damage costs from the 2018 Camp Fire and 2017 Tubbs Fire, among others. PG&E pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in the Camp Fire, shortly before the company exited bankruptcy in June of 2020. In January of 2022, Cal Fire determined that the Dixie Fire, the largest fire of the 2021 California wildfire season and largest non-complex fire in recorded California history, was caused by a tree contacting PG&E electrical distribution lines.\n\n\n\n### Firefighter shortages[edit]\n\n\nThe lead-in to the 2022 Western United States fire season was also marked by concerns about firefighting staffing. On March 15, 2022, *Politico* reported that United States Forest Service (USFS) officials had warned California employees that there had been \"50 percent fewer applications submitted for GS3 through GS9 firefighting positions\" compared to 2021, in part because of low pay, housing issues, and high cost of living.[18] The *San Francisco Chronicle* similarly reported that between 2019 and 2021, the number of U.S. Forest Service firefighters stationed in California dropped by more than 20%, or over 1,000 firefighters.[19] Testifying for the Senate Appropriations Committee on May 4, USFS Chief Randy Moore noted that in some areas, the USFS had only reached 50% of the staffing goal for wildland firefighters so far. Chief Moore cited competition in the labor market, including with private, county, and state organizations, such as Cal Fire, as a major reason for the hiring challenges.[20] During the peak of fire season, representatives of California's private timber industry called for firefighting reserves to be augmented by the U.S. military and the National Guard, but were resisted by federal and state officials who noted the cost of such efforts and the lack of extreme resource needs during the season so far. The state has been forced to seek military assistance in the past during severe fire seasons.[21]\n\n\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nAnthropogenic climate change is partially responsible for driving increased wildfire severity in California.[22][23] For instance, background warming has led to weather and vegetation conditions more favorable for wildfire activity even at night, which has typically been a period of reduced activity that allows crews to intensify efforts to suppress fires.[24]\n\n\n\n### Drought[edit]\n\n\nThe state of California is experiencing drought conditions on a number of timescales. The state saw very little precipitation in the January to March time period, with much of the state experiencing its driest such period. As of March 22, 2022, the National Drought Mitigation Center's U.S. Drought Monitor saw the entire state in moderate to extreme drought conditions.[25] In February, their Drought Severity and Coverage (DSCI) index, which measures cumulative dryness, was at 275, or nearly twice the 20-year average of approximately 146, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.[26] This dry period is part of an ongoing 22-year spell of drought in the North American West that marks the driest such period in at least 1,200 years, according to scientific research based on analysis of soil moisture deficits and tree rings.[27][28]\n\n\nThe drought has impacted wildfire risk and severity in a number of ways. Increased dryness of fuels, driven by increased vapor pressure deficit (VPD), a measure of the aridity of the atmosphere, is behind an eightfold increase in the area burned by wildfires in the summer in California since 1972, according to scientific research.[29] Drought and overcrowding have also made forests more vulnerable not just to wildfires but bark beetle infestation, which has further weakened and killed forests. Total tree mortality since 2010 exceeds 172 million, providing plentiful fuel for wildfires.[30]\n\n\n\n### Forest management and fire suppression[edit]\n\n\nScientists believe that prior to European colonization, far more area\u2014between 4.4 and 11.8 million acres\u2014was burned on an annual basis in California than in modern history, as a combination of wildfires and indigenous controlled burning.[31] Beginning with the advent of the U.S. Forest Service's '10 AM policy', in which it sought to extinguish all fires by 10 AM the morning after their report, the primary method of wildfire management in California has been suppression.[32] The success of this approach has led to a surfeit of fuel, resulting in larger and more extreme fires. \n\n\n\n### Wildland-urban interface development[edit]\n\n\nCalifornia, as with other areas of the United States and the world, has experienced a growing amount of human development into the wildland-urban interface, or WUI. This area consists of developed areas either adjacent to, or intermingled with, wildland vegetation and fuels. Such areas are more prone to wildfire ignitions and structure losses, increasing the risk and severity of fire seasons in California.[33] The 2018 Camp Fire and 2017 Tubbs Fire are two examples of recent California wildfires that resulted devastating losses in WUI communities.\n\n\n\n## List of wildfires[edit]\n\n\nThe following is a list of fires that burned more than 1,000 acres (400 ha), produced significant structural damage or casualties, or were otherwise notable. Acreage and containment figures may not be up to date.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | County\n | Acres\n | Start date\n | Containment date\n | Notes\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Airport Fire\n | Inyo | 4,136 | February 16, 2022 | February 26, 2022 | Unknown cause | [34] |\n| Coastal Fire\n | Orange | 200 | May 11, 2022 | May 17, 2022 | Unknown cause; burned into a neighborhood and destroyed 20 homes | [35][36] |\n| Lost Lake Fire\n | Riverside | 5,856 | May 26, 2022 | June 8, 2022 | Unknown cause\n | [37] |\n| Thunder Fire\n | Kern | 2,500 | June 22, 2022 | June 27, 2022 | Likely caused by lightning strike\n | [38][39] |\n| Roblar Fire\n | Sonoma | 63 | June 27, 2022 | June 27, 2022 | Unknown cause; 1 fatality from person trapped in a vehicle | [40] |\n| Electra Fire | Amador, Calaveras | 4,478 | July 4, 2022 | July 28, 2022 | Unknown cause, possibly fireworks from Fourth of July celebrations[41] | [42] |\n| Washburn Fire | Mariposa, Madera | 4,886 | July 7, 2022 | July 30, 2022 | Human caused, forced evacuations in Wawona and trail closures in Yosemite National Park; threatened Mariposa Grove | [43][44] |\n| Oak Fire | Mariposa | 19,244 | July 22, 2022 | August 10, 2022 | Unknown cause, forced evacuations in Mariposa County.

By the end of 2021 a total of 8,835 fires were recorded, burning 2,568,948 acres (1,039,616\u00a0ha) across the state.[1] Approximately 3,629 structures were damaged or destroyed by the wildfires, and at least seven firefighters and two civilians were injured.[1]\n\n\nThe wildfire season in California experienced an unusually early start amid an ongoing drought and historically low rainfall and reservoir levels.[2] In January 2021 alone, 297 fires burned 1,171 acres (4.74\u00a0km2) on nonfederal land according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, which is almost triple the number of fires and more than 20 times the acreage of the five-year average for January.[3][2] The January fires were exacerbated by unseasonably strong Santa Ana winds, and some of them burned in the same areas as previous fires like the CZU Lightning Complex.[4]\n\n\nThe long term trend is that wildfires in the state are increasing due to climate change in California.[5][6] The 2021 wildfire season was exceptionally severe in California, although it did not approach the extent of the previous year's wildfire season, which was the largest season in the state's recorded history. As of July 11, more than three times as many acres have burned compared to the previous year through that date, with drought, extreme heat, and reduced snowpack contributing to the severity of the fires.[7][8][9] The state also faces an increased risk of post-wildfire landslides.[10][11]\n\n\nAs of August 18, 2021, the state of California was facing \"unprecedented fire conditions\" as multiple fires including the Dixie Fire, McFarland Fire, Caldor Fire, and others, raged on.[12] The USDA Forest Service temporarily closed all of California's national forests at the end of August to mitigate the impact of potential fires.[13]\n\n\nOn October 18, 2021, much of the state\u2014particularly Northern California, where the majority of the significant fires had been located\u2014received its first major precipitation since the start of the wildfire season.[14] This significantly lowered wildfire risk in the region.\n\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

By the end of the year, 9,917 fires[1] had burned 4,397,809 acres (1,779,730\u00a0ha),[2][3][3] more than 4% of the state's roughly 100 million acres of land, making 2020 the largest wildfire season recorded in California's modern history (according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection),[5][6] though roughly equivalent to the pre-1800 levels which averaged around 4.4 million acres yearly and up to 12 million in peak years.[7] California's August Complex fire has been described as the first \"gigafire\", burning over 1 million acres across seven counties, an area larger than the state of Rhode Island. The fires destroyed over 10,000 structures[1] and cost over $12.079 billion (2020 USD) in damages, including over $10 billion in property damage and $2.079 billion in fire suppression costs.[4][2] The intensity of the fire season has been attributed to a combination of more than a century of poor forest management[8][9] and higher temperatures resulting from climate change.[10][11]\n\n\nOn August 18, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency,[12] and on August 19, 2020, reported that the state was battling 367 known fires, many sparked by intense thunderstorms on August 16\u201317 caused by moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm Fausto. Response and evacuations were complicated by a historic heatwave and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. On August 22, President Donald Trump issued a major disaster declaration (DR-4558), which provides Individual Assistance and/or Public Assistance.\n\n\nIn early September 2020, a combination of a record-breaking heat wave and strong katabatic winds, (including the Jarbo, Diablo, and Santa Ana) caused explosive fire growth. The August Complex became California's largest recorded wildfire.[13] The Creek Fire expanded in the Big Creek drainage area, temporarily trapping hundreds of campers near the Mammoth Pool Reservoir. The North Complex explosively grew in size as the winds fanned it westward, threatening the city of Oroville, triggering mass evacuations, and causing 16 fatalities.[14]\n\n\nGovernor Newsom's request for a federal disaster declaration for six major wildfires was approved on October 17 after having been rejected the previous day.[15][16]\n\n\nOn November 10, 2020, the National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC) reported that there were around 3,400 firefighters plus personnel fighting the wildfires in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n## Early outlook[edit]\n\n\nEarly in the year, there was a concern for the 2020 fire season to potentially be prolonged and especially grave, due to the unusually dry months of January and February, one of the driest such periods of any calendar year on record.[17] On March 22, a state of emergency was declared by California Governor Gavin Newsom due to a mass die-off of trees throughout the state, potentially increasing the risk of wildfires.[18] However, throughout March and April, rain began to consistently fall in the state, which alleviated the drought conditions. Despite this, Northern California was still expected to have severe wildfire conditions due to the moderate or severe drought conditions in the area, whereas Central and Southern California were expected to have serious fire conditions later in the year due to the late wet season and precipitation.[19]\n\n\nOn June 18, climate scientist Daniel Swain predicted the 2020 Arizona wildfire season was a sign of what was to come in California, due to similar drought and weather conditions between Arizona and Northern California.[20]\n\n\n\n## Seasonal fire risk[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) \"What are California megafires? Things to Know\", 11.20.2019, *Knowable Magazine* |\n\n\nThe year 2020 was the largest wildfire year recorded in California history, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.[2][5] From a historical perspective, the average annual acres burned prior to 1850 were probably significantly larger than years since reliable fire records began. Scott Stephens, a professor of fire science at UC Berkeley, estimated that prior to 1850, about 4,500,000 acres (1,800,000\u00a0ha) burned yearly, in fires that lasted for months. Activity peaked roughly every 30 years, with up to 11,800,000 acres (4,800,000\u00a0ha) burning during peak years.[8][9][21] The indigenous peoples of California historically set controlled burns and allowed natural fires to run their course.[8][7]\n\n\nThe peak of the wildfire season usually occurs between July and November when hot, dry winds are most frequent. The wildfire season typically does not end until the first significant rainstorm of autumn arrives, which is usually around October in Northern California, and early November in Southern California.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAs wildfire becomes more frequent, the wildland\u2013urban interface has increasingly become more dangerous when it comes to property damage and risk to life.[22]\n\n\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\n\n### Land development and forest management[edit]\n\n\nScientists believe that, prior to development, California fires regularly burned significantly more acreage than has been seen in recent history.[23] Wildfires have been aggressively suppressed in recent years, resulting in a buildup of fuel, increasing the risk of large uncontrollable fires. There is broad scientific consensus that there should be more controlled burning of forests in California in order to reduce fire risk.[23] A 2020 ProPublica investigation blames a combination of climate change and a history of insufficient controlled burning for the increase in \"megafires.\"[9] A sharp increase in the population and development of fire-prone areas has also contributed to the increase in flammable tinder.[24]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Los Angeles Times* on 13 September described the fire as a climate apocalypse.\nClimate change increases the temperature of wildfires in California, the risk for drought, and potentially also the frequency of such events.[25][10] David Romps, director of the Berkeley Atmospheric Sciences Center summarizes the situation as follows: \"To cut to the chase: Were the heat wave and the lightning strikes and the dryness of the vegetation affected by global warming? Absolutely yes. Were they made significantly hotter, more numerous, and drier because of global warming? Yes, likely yes, and yes.\"[11]\n\n\nSimilarly, Friederike Otto, acting director of the University of Oxford Environmental Change Institute states, \"There is absolutely no doubt that the extremely high temperatures are higher than they would have been without human-induced climate change. A huge body of attribution literature demonstrates now that climate change is an absolute game-changer when it comes to heat waves, and California won't be the exception.\"[26] Susan Clark, director of the Sustainability Initiative at the University at Buffalo argues, \"This is climate change. This increased intensity and frequency of temperatures and heat waves are part of the projections for the future. [...] There is going to be more morbidity and mortality [from heat.] There are going to be more extremes.\"[26]\n\n\nThe National Interagency Fire Center's (NFIC) National Interagency Coordination (NICC) reported that monthly outlooks for the entire country will still drive wildfires across the country but especially California.

By the end of the year, according to Cal Fire and the US Forest Service, 7,860 fires were recorded, totaling an estimated of 259,823 acres (105,147 hectares) of burned land.[1] These fires caused 22 injuries, 3 fatalities, and damaged or destroyed 732 structures.[3] The 2019 California fire season was less active than that of the two previous years (2017 and 2018), which set records for acreage, destructiveness, and deaths.\n\n\nIn late October, the Kincade Fire became the largest fire of the year, burning 77,758 acres (31,468\u00a0ha) in Sonoma County by November 6.\n\n\nMassive preemptive public safety power shutoff events have been controversial. Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric had preemptively shut off power to 800,000 electric customers to reduce the risk of wildfires by preventing electrical arcing in high winds from their above-ground power lines.[4][5] While large areas were without power for days, people in fire danger areas had trouble getting information, and critical life support equipment would not work without backup power.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early projections[edit]\n\n\nFire behavioral experts and climatologists warned that heavy rains from months early in the year had produced an excess of vegetation that would become an abundance of dry fuel later in the year as the fire season gets underway.[7] According to the US Forest Service and US Department of the Interior officials, early projections indicated that the fire season would possibly be worse than the year prior, stating that \"if we're lucky, this year will simply be a challenging one.\" This assessment was written on the basis of noting that the state has recently been seeing consistently destructive fires more often than ever before.[8]\n\n\n\n## Wildfires[edit]\n\n\nThe following is a list of fires that burned more than 1,000 acres (400\u00a0ha), or produced significant structural damage or casualties:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | County\n | Acres\n | Start date\n | Containment date\n | Notes\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Refuge | Kern | 2,500 | May 7 | May 9 | 1 structure destroyed | [9] |\n| Boulder | San Luis Obispo | 1,127 | June 5 | June 11 |  | [10] |\n| Sand | Yolo | 2,512 | June 8 | June 17 | 7 structures destroyed, 2 injuries | [11][12] |\n| West Butte | Sutter | 1,300 | June 8 | June 10 |  | [13][14] |\n| McMillan | San Luis Obispo | 1,764 | June 12 | June 14 |  | [13][15] |\n| Lonoak | Monterey | 2,546 | June 25 | June 26 | Downed PG&E power line was the cause[16] | [17] |\n| Rock | Stanislaus | 2,422 | June 25 | June 27 |  | [18] |\n| Cow | Inyo, Tulare | 1,975 | July 25 | October 11 | Caused by lightning strike | [19] |\n| Springs | Mono | 4,840 | July 26 | October 7 | Caused by lightning strike | [20] |\n| Tucker | Modoc | 14,150 | July 28 | August 15 | Unintentionally caused by vehicular traffic along California State Route 139[21][22] | [23][24] |\n| W-1 McDonald | Lassen | 1,020 | August 8 | August 11 | Caused by lightning strike | [25][26] |\n| Gaines | Mariposa | 1,300 | August 16 | August 20 |  | [27] |\n| Mountain | Shasta | 600 | August 22 | August 26 | 14 buildings destroyed, 7 damaged and 3 people injured | [28] |\n| Long Valley | Lassen | 2,438 | August 24 | August 27 |  | [29] |\n| R-1 Ranch | Lassen | 3,380 | August 28 | September 5 | Caused by lightning strike | [30] |\n| Tenaja | Riverside | 1,926 | September 4 | September 14 |  | [31] |\n| Walker | Plumas | 54,608 | September 4 | September 25 | 9 structures destroyed | [32] |\n| Taboose | Inyo | 10,296 | September 4 | November 21 | Caused by lightning strike | [33] |\n| Lime | Siskiyou | 1,872 | September 4 | September 19 | Caused by lightning strike | [34][35] |\n| Middle | Trinity | 1,339 | September 5 | October 5 | Caused by lightning strike | [36] |\n| Red Bank | Tehama | 8,838 | September 5 | September 13 | Caused by lightning strike;

It was also the largest on record at the time, now third after the 2020 and 2021 California wildfire seasons.[18][19][20] In 2018, there were a total of 103 confirmed fatalities, 24,226 structures damaged or destroyed, and 8,527 fires burning 1,975,086 acres (799,289\u00a0ha), about 2% of the state's 100 million acres of land. Through the end of August 2018, Cal Fire alone spent $432 million on operations.[21] The catastrophic Camp Fire alone killed at least 85 people, destroyed 18,804 buildings and caused $16.5 billion in property damage, while overall the fires resulted in at least $26.347 billion in property damage and firefighting costs,[13][15][16][17][14] including $25.4 billion in property damage and $947 million in fire suppression costs.[13][14]\n\n\nIn mid-July to August 2018, a series of large wildfires erupted across California, mostly in the northern part of the state. On August 4, 2018, a national disaster was declared in Northern California, due to the extensive wildfires burning there.[22]\n\n\nThe Carr Fire in July and August 2018 caused more than $1.5 billion (2018 USD) in property damage.[17][23][24][25] The Mendocino Complex Fire burned more than 459,000 acres (186,000\u00a0ha), becoming the largest complex fire in the state's history at the time, with the complex's Ranch Fire surpassing the Thomas Fire and the Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 to become California's single-largest recorded wildfire.[26][27] In September 2020, the August Complex surpassed the Mendocino Complex to become California's single-largest recorded wildfire.[28]\n\n\nIn November 2018, strong winds aggravated conditions in another round of large, destructive fires that occurred across the state. This new batch of wildfires included the Woolsey Fire and the Camp Fire. The Camp Fire destroyed the town of Paradise and killed at least 85 people, with 1 still unaccounted for as of August 2, 2019.[29] The Camp Fire destroyed more than 18,000 structures, becoming both California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire on record. AccuWeather estimated the total economic cost of the 2018 wildfires at $400 billion (2018 USD), which includes property damage, firefighting costs, direct and indirect economic losses, as well as recovery expenditures.[30] Another study, published two years after the fires, estimated the total damages at $148.5 billion, including capital losses, health costs and indirect losses.[31]\n\n\n\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\n\nSeveral factors led to the destructiveness of the 2018 California wildfire season. A combination of increased fuel loading and atmospheric conditions influenced by global warming led to a series of destructive fires. Primary causes of wildfire vary geographically based on many factors, such as topography.[32] For example, characteristically dense forests in the Sierra Nevada Mountains harbor fuel-driven fires while the open central valley from the south Bay Area to San Diego County are more prone to wind-driven fire over dry grasslands.[32]\n\n\n\n### Increase in fuel[edit]\n\n\nA direct contributor to the 2018 California wildfires was an increase in dead tree fuel.[33] By December 2017, there was a record 129 million dead trees in California.[34] Tree mortality is linked to a period during the 2010s of \"anomalously warm droughts\" [35] that were severe and long-lasting enough to stand out even amongst California's existing history of wildfires and exceptionally dry conditions.[32] One study focused on the concentrated mortality of densely populated conifers of the Sierra Nevada \"found that die-off was closely tied to multi-year deep-rooting-zone drying\" and that severity of that dryness can be used to predict mortality.[35] Such drought leaves trees stressed for water, which makes them susceptible to beetle infestation and exacerbates tree mortality further.[36]\n\n\nDrought intensity lessened in California by 2017,[37] but the effects of tree mortality linger for years. One study expresses a lack of sufficient data to confidently determine the rate of coniferous tree decay in the Sierra Nevada.[38] Nonetheless, it is a gradual process, and the remaining dead tree matter is an optimal fuel source for future wild fires.\n\n\n\n### Atmospheric conditions[edit]\n\n\nStanford Earth System Science Professor Noah Diffenbaugh stated that atmospheric conditions for California wildfires are expected to worsen in the future because of the effects of climate change in California and that \"what we're seeing over the last few years in terms of the wildfire season in California [is] very consistent with the historical trends in terms of increasing temperatures, increasing dryness, and increasing wildfire risk.\" Other experts agreed, saying that global warming is to blame for these extreme weather conditions. Global warming has led to higher temperatures and longer summers, creating a drier landscape that gave fires more fuel to burn longer and stronger.\n\n\n[39] Research published August 2018 predicted an increase in the number of wildfires in California as a consequence of climate change.[40] However, from a historical perspective, it has been estimated that prior to 1850, about 4.5 million acres (17,000\u00a0km2) burned yearly, in fires that lasted for months.[41]\n\n\n\n### Residential construction in the wildland-urban interface[edit]\n\n\nA wildland\u2013urban interface (or WUI) refers to the zone of transition between unoccupied land and human development. Communities that are within 0.5 miles (0.80\u00a0 km) of the zone may also be included. These lands and communities adjacent to and surrounded by wildlands are at risk of wildfires.[42] Since the 1990s, over 43% of new residential buildings have been constructed in this area. In some areas, the amount of new residences in those areas is 80%.[43] In the past, when these areas burned, no residences were lost, but now residences are present, which end up being destroyed.[44] Furthermore, a \"century of successful fire suppression\" performed in an attempt to protect forests and those living in WUIs has also disrupted natural cycles of disturbance and renewed succession of an ecosystem by allowing fuel to reach abnormal density levels discussed above.\n\n\n[32]\n\n\n\n## Air quality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Air quality of California on August 7, 2018\nNorthern California and the Central Valley saw drastic increases in air pollutants during the height of the July and August fires, while Southern California also experienced an increase in air pollution in August.[45] Air quality in Northern and Central California remained poor until mid-September 2018, when fire activity was drastically diminished. However, during the November Camp Fire, air quality diminished again, with the majority of the Bay Area being subjected to air quality indexes (AQIs) of 200 and above, in the \"unhealthy\" region.\n\n\n\n\n## Wildfires[edit]\n\n\nThe following is a list of fires that burned more than 1,000 acres (400\u00a0ha), or produced significant structural damage or loss of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | County\n | Acres\n | Start date\n | Containment date\n | Notes\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pleasant | Inyo | 2,070 | February 18, 2018 | April 3, 2018 | First significant wildfire of the year\n | [46] |\n| Moffat | Inyo | 1,265 | April 19, 2018 | May 21, 2018 |  | [47] |\n| Nees | Merced | 1,756 | May 2, 2018 | May 17, 2018 |  | [48] |\n| Patterson | Riverside | 1,261 | May 17, 2018 | May 21, 2018 |  | [49] |\n| Panoche | San Benito | 64 | June 4, 2018 | June 7, 2018 | 3 civilians killed | [50][4] |\n| Stone | Los Angeles | 1,352 | June 4, 2018 | June 13, 2018 |  | [51] |\n| Airline | San Benito | 1,314 | June 4, 2018 | June 14, 2018 |  | [52] |\n| Apple | Tehama | 2,956 | June 9, 2018 | June 14, 2018 | 3 residential structures and 2 outbuildings destroyed | [53] |\n| Chrome | Glenn | 2,290 | June 9, 2018 | June 21, 2018 | 1 outbuilding destroyed | [54] |\n| Lions | Madera | 13,347 | June 11, 2018 | October 1, 2018 |  | [55][56] |\n| Planada | Merced | 4,564 | June 15, 2018 | June 21, 2018 |  | [57] |\n| Yankee | San Luis Obispo | 1,500 | June 20, 2018 | July 1, 2018 |  | [58] |\n| Lane | Tehama | 3,716 | June 23, 2018 | July 4, 2018 | 1 injury | [59] |\n| Pawnee | Lake | 15,185 | June 23, 2018 | July 8, 2018 | 22 structures destroyed, 1 injury | [60] |\n| Creek | Madera | 1,678 | June 24, 2018 | July 5, 2018 | 4 residential structures and 7 minor structures destroyed | [61] |\n| Waverly | San Joaquin | 12,300 | June 29, 2018 | July 2, 2018 |  | [62] |\n| County | Lake, Napa, Yolo | 90,288 | June 30, 2018 | July 14, 2018 | 20 structures destroyed;

While the Panoche incident was the smallest of the three fires, burning only 64 acres (26\u00a0ha), the remains of three people were found in a destroyed camping trailer in the burn area.[4][121] The remains were believed to belong to a mother, a toddler, and an infant.[4][122]\n\n\nOn July 14, a Cal Fire bulldozer operator was killed while fighting the Ferguson Fire, becoming the first firefighter death of the season.[5]\n\n\nOn July 23, the Carr Fire broke out after a vehicle malfunctioned. While the Carr Fire burned in rural areas of Shasta County for the first few days, it crossed the Sacramento River and entered the city limits of Redding, California on the evening of July 26. By the next morning, two firefighters and four civilians had been killed.[6][7][123]\n\n\nOn July 29, a firefighter with the National Park Service was killed after a dead tree fell and struck him, while he was fighting the Ferguson Fire. He was \"treated on scene, but died before he could be taken to the hospital\".[8]\n\n\nOn August 4, a Pacific Gas and Electric Company employee was killed in a vehicle incident while working to restore services to areas impacted by the Carr Fire.[9]\n\n\nOn August 9, a Cal Fire heavy equipment mechanic was killed in a traffic incident while working at the Carr Fire.[10]\n\n\nOn August 13, a firefighter was killed while fighting the Mendocino Complex Fire.[11]\n\n\nOn November 8, 2018, 85 civilians were killed by the Camp Fire, while three firefighters were injured. The number dead had been listed at 87, lowered to 85 by early December when it was discovered one victim was put in several bags.[124] Three people [12] also died during the Woolsey Fire near Malibu.[125]\n\n\n\n## Response efforts[edit]\n\n\nDirect Relief provided emergency, firefighting and medical supplies medications to first responders and affected communities.[126]\n\n\n\n## Verizon Wireless data throttling[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2018, the Santa Clara County Fire Department raised claims against Verizon Wireless that their \"unlimited\" data service had been throttled while the fire department was attempting to contain the Mendocino Complex Fire. The Verizon contract stated that the department's plan would be throttled down to 200 kbit/s or 600 kbit/s once the department had used 25 GB in a single month. However, the contract stated that the usage related throttling would not apply in certain emergency situations, such as wildfire containment operations. The plan remained throttled, despite the department's notification to Verizon regarding the situation.[127][128]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Photograph of smoky sky near sunset in early August looking toward the west, in Sacramento, California.

However, according to a report published by the National Interagency Fire Center, the potential for large fires was \"expected to remain near normal through the spring, but once fine fuels dry out, there will likely be a spike in grass fire activity.\"[13]\n\n\nIn December 2017, strong Santa Ana winds triggered a new round of wildfires, including the massive Thomas Fire in Ventura County.[14][15] At the time, the Thomas Fire was California's largest modern wildfire, which has since been surpassed by the Mendocino Complex's Ranch Fire in 2018. The December 2017 fires forced over 230,000 people to evacuate, with the 6 largest fires burning over 307,900 acres (1,246\u00a0km2) and more than 1,300 structures.[16][17]\n\n\nDuring the year, 5 of the 20 most destructive wildfires in the state's history burned between October and December: #1 Tubbs, #6 Nuns, #7 Thomas, #11 Atlas, and #17 Redwood Valley.[11] The wildfires collectively caused at least $18.0 billion (2018 USD) in damages, including $13.2 billion in insured losses, $3 billion in other economic losses, and $1.8 billion in fire suppression costs, making the 2017 California fires the second-costliest on record.[3][4] The total economic cost, including fire suppression, insurance, direct and indirect economic losses, and recovery expenditures is estimated at about $180 billion (2017 USD).[18] This number includes economic harm to the wine industry, where several wineries in Napa and Sonoma were destroyed, and where many wine grapes were severely damaged by smoke. Cal Fire spent $700 million during fiscal year 2017, far exceeding the approximately $426 million the agency had budgeted that year for fire suppression.[12] This made 2017 the most expensive firefighting year on record in California state history.[19]\n\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2017 will be remembered as a year of extremes. It was the third-warmest year on record for the United States, and it was the second-hottest in California, bringing to the surface the question of long-term climate change and its contribution to the 2017 California fires. The hotter temperatures dry out vegetation, making them easier to burn, predisposing vulnerable regions like California to more wildfires in the coming decades as temperatures continue to rise and rainfall continues to decline.[12] Historically, it has been estimated that prior to 1850, about 4.5 million acres (17,000 km\u00b2) burned yearly, in fires that lasted for months.[20]\n\n\n\n\n## Wildfire maps[edit]\n\n\nThis section contains maps of the locations and burn areas of the fires that occurred during the largest outbreaks of the season.

October Northern California wildfires[edit]\n\n\nMain article: October 2017 Northern California wildfires\n\nDuring the month of October, a series of wildfires broke out throughout Napa, Lake, Sonoma, Mendocino, and Butte counties during severe fire weather conditions, effectively leading to a major red flag warning from much of the northern California area. In the extreme conditions, small fires quickly grew to become massive conflagrations spanning from 1,000 to well over 20,000 acres within a single day.[98] The fires destroyed an estimated 8,900 structures, killed at least 44 people,[99] burned over 245,000 acres (99,148\u00a0ha) of land,[72] and forced over 20,000 people to evacuate.[100][101]\n\n\n\n## December Southern California wildfires[edit]\n\n\nMain article: December 2017 Southern California wildfires\n\nMultiple wildfires ignited in December across Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Ventura, San Diego, Riverside, Santa Barbara Counties. The fires were exacerbated by unusually powerful and long-lasting Santa Ana winds, we had no rain in sight, cause of the drought, it has been driest December years ever record since 1989, and 1999.[102] as well as large amounts of dry vegetation grown, due to large amounts of precipitation earlier in the year. The fires burned over 307,900 acres (1,246\u00a0km2), and caused traffic disruptions, school closures, hazardous air quality conditions, and massive power outages. California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties,[103] and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti declared a state of emergency for the city.[104] The largest fire was the Thomas Fire, which grew to 281,893 acres, becoming California's largest modern wildfire at the time, since surpassed by the Mendocino Complex's Ranch Fire in 2018.[105][106][107][108][109]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)California portal\n\n\n* List of California wildfires\n* May 2014 San Diego County wildfires\n* 2008 California wildfires\n* October 2007 California wildfires\n* 2017 California floods\n* Climate change in California\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"National Report of Wildland Fires and Acres Burned by State 2017\" (PDF). *National Interagency Fire Center*.

Although the Pacific Ocean\u2019s warming water had been expected to bring strong storms to parts of the southwestern United States, actual precipitation totals generally underperformed those expectations.[4] Early in 2016, The National Interagency Fire Center predicted that conditions from May through at least August would put much of the western United States in above-normal wildfire danger.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nIn June, the United States Forest Service estimated that over 26 million trees had died across 760,000 acres (310,000\u00a0ha) in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This brought the number of dead trees to over 66 million during the past four years of drought.[6]\n\n\nOn August 15, the National Interagency Fire Center showed the state leading the nation in the quantity, size and intensity of wildfires.[6] A day later, on August 16, San Bernardino County announced that nearly 85,000 people were evacuated because of the Blue Cut Fire near Cajon Pass.[7] Authorities arrested a 40-year-old man in connection to the Clayton Fire, and charged him with 17 counts of arson.[6]\n\n\n\n## Fires[edit]\n\n\nBelow is a list of all fires that exceeded 1,000 acres (400\u00a0ha) during the 2016 California wildfire season, as well as the fires that caused significant damage.[8] The information is taken from CAL FIRE's list of large fires, and other sources where indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | County\n | Acres\n | Start Date\n | Containment Date\n | Notes\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roberts | San Luis Obispo | 3,712 | May 18, 2016 | May 20, 2016 |  | [9] |\n| Metz | Monterey | 3,876 | May 22, 2016 | May 25, 2016 |  | [10] |\n| Coleman | Monterey | 2,520 | June 4, 2016 | June 17, 2016 |  | [11] |\n| Pony | Siskiyou | 2,860 | June 7, 2016 | June 30, 2016 |  | [12] |\n| Sherpa | Santa Barbara | 7,474 | June 15, 2016 | July 12, 2016 |  | [13] |\n| Border | San Diego | 7,609 | June 19, 2016 | June 30, 2016 | 2 fatalities, 5 homes and 11 outbuildings destroyed | [14] |\n| Pine | Ventura | 2,304 | June 19, 2016 | July 17, 2016 |  | [15] |\n| San Gabriel Complex | Los Angeles | 5,399 | June 20, 2016 | July 23, 2016 | Reservoir Fire burned 1,146 acres; Fish Fire burned 4,253 acres | [16] |\n| Erskine | Kern | 48,019 | June 23, 2016 | July 12, 2016 | 2 fatalities, 285 homes destroyed, 12 damaged | [17] |\n| Trailhead | Placer | 5,646 | June 28, 2016 | July 18, 2016 |  | [18] |\n| Deer | Kern | 1,785 | July 1, 2016 | July 11, 2016 |  | [19] |\n| Curry | Fresno | 2,944 | July 1, 2016 | July 5, 2016 |  | [20] |\n| Sage | Los Angeles | 1,109 | July 9, 2016 | July 16, 2016 |  | [21] |\n| Roblar | San Diego | 1,245 | July 21, 2016 | July 30, 2016 |  | [22] |\n| Sand | Los Angeles | 41,432 | July 22, 2016 | August 3, 2016 | 2 fatalities, 18 homes destroyed, 4 damaged [23] | [24] |\n| Soberanes | Monterey | 132,100 | July 22, 2016 | October 12, 2016 | 1 fatality, 3 injuries, 57 homes and 11 outbuildings destroyed. | [25] |\n| Goose | Fresno | 2,241 | July 30, 2016 | August 9, 2016 | 4 homes, 5 outbuildings destroyed | [26] |\n| Cold | Yolo | 5,731 | August 2, 2016 | August 12, 2016 | 2 outbuildings destroyed | [27] |\n| Pilot | San Bernardino | 8,110 | August 7, 2016 | August 16, 2016 |  | [28] |\n| Mineral | Fresno | 7,050 | August 9, 2016 | August 18, 2016 | 2 structures destroyed | [29] |\n| Chimney | San Luis Obispo | 46,344 | August 13, 2016 | September 6, 2016 | 48 structures destroyed | [30] |\n| Clayton | Lake | 3,929 | August 13, 2016 | August 26, 2016 | 300 buildings destroyed | [31] |\n| Blue Cut | San Bernardino | 36,274 | August 16, 2016 | August 23, 2016 | 105 homes, 213 outbuildings destroyed | [32] |\n| Cedar | Kern | 29,322 | August 16, 2016 | September 30, 2016 |  | [33] |\n| Rey | Santa Barbara | 32,606 | August 18, 2016 | September 16, 2016 |  | [34] |\n| Gap | Siskiyou | 33,867 | August 27, 2016 | September 17, 2016 |  | [35] |\n| Bogart | Riverside | 1,470 | August 30, 2016 | September 2, 2016 | 1 outbuilding destroyed | [36] |\n| Willard | Lassen | 2,575 | September 11, 2016 | September 22, 2016 | 5 structures destroyed | [37] |\n| Owens River | Mono | 5,443 | September 17, 2016 | October 15, 2016 |  | [38] |\n| Canyon | Santa Barbara | 12,518 | September 17, 2016 | September 24, 2016 | 1 firefighter killed in crash | [39] |\n| Sawmill | Sonoma | 1,547 | September 25, 2016 | September 29, 2016 |  | [40] |\n| Marshes | Tuolumne | 1,080 | September 26, 2016 | October 4, 2016 |  | [41] |\n| Loma | Santa Clara | 4,474 | September 26, 2016 | October 12, 2016 | 28 structures destroyed | [42] |\n\n\n## 4S Ranch brush fire[edit]\n\n\nOn Thursday, May 5, 2016, shortly before 3 P.M. PDT, a small brush fire ignited off the 15000 block of Dove Creek Road, in a creek bed, in 4S Ranch, San Diego County.[43][44] As the fire began spreading eastward, students and staff at the nearby Oak Valley Middle School were ordered to stay indoors, though parents were allowed to pick up their children.[44][45] However, as the fire continued to spread, evacuation orders were issued for some homes along Palomino Valley Road and Oak Valley Middle School, with the students from Oak Valley Middle School being relocated by bus to Westview High School.[43] The sudden change caused some confusion and chaos among parents attempting to pick up their children, and drew criticism towards the last-minute evacuation plan.[45] The brush fire quickly grew to 5 acres (0.020\u00a0km2), but within a couple of hours, the fire was contained and further growth was stopped.[46] At 4:34 PM PDT, the evacuation orders for the homes on Palomino Valley Road were lifted, as the fire was brought to 90% containment.[43] Just before 5:30 PM PDT, the brush fire was fully extinguished, and Rancho Santa Fe fire officials declared 100% containment of the fire. The fire did not cause any injuries or structural damage.[46] The brush fire was determined to have been accidentally caused by sparks coming from a welder.[44]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of California wildfires\n* 2005 Labor Day brush fire\n* 2016 Fort McMurray Wildfire\n* 2014 California wildfires\n\t+ May 2014 San Diego County wildfires\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Ken Pimlott (2017). \"2016 Wildfire Activity Statistics\" (PDF).

By the end of 2015 a total of 8,745 fires were recorded, burning 893,362 acres (3,615\u00a0km2) across the state.[1] Approximately 3,159 structures were damaged or destroyed by wildfires, and at least 7 fatalities were recorded.\n\n\nOn September 11, after the Butte Fire exploded from a size of 32,000 acres (129\u00a0km2)[4] to 65,000 acres (263\u00a0km2), in the Amador and Calaveras counties, Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Nationwide fire season[edit]\n\n\nThe National Interagency Fire Center reported in mid-August that the 2015 fire season had been the most destructive since 2011. Nationwide, a total of 6,058,694 acres (24,519\u00a0km2) had burned, which is roughly triple the total land area burned from the same time span in 2014.[6] By the end of August, in terms of the land area burned, the 2015 nationwide wildfire season had surpassed any other wildfire season in the last 10 years, with 7,825,559 acres (31,669\u00a0km2) burned.[7]\n\n\n\n## Fatalities[edit]\n\n\nThe season also proved to be a deadly one for firefighters battling the many blazes throughout the state. A United States Forest Service member from South Dakota died on July 31 from carbon monoxide poisoning, while battling the Frog Fire in the Modoc National Forest.[8] A second firefighter was killed on August 8 by a falling tree, while battling the Sierra Fire south of Echo Summit.[9] A 72-year-old disabled woman was killed in her home by the fast-moving Valley Fire.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Fires[edit]\n\n\nBelow is a list of all fires that exceeded 1,000 acres (400\u00a0ha) during the 2015 California wildfire season, as well as the fires that caused significant damage.[11] The information is taken from CAL FIRE's list of large fires, and other sources where indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | County\n | Acres\n | Km2 | Start Date\n | Containment Date\n | Notes\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Round | Inyo | 7,000\n | 28.3 | February 6, 2015 | February 12, 2015 |  | [12] |\n| Highway | Riverside | 1,049\n | 4.2 | April 18, 2015 | April 24, 2015 |  | [13] |\n| Lake | San Bernardino | 31,359\n | 126.9 | June 17, 2015 | August 1, 2015 |  | [14] |\n| Park Hill | San Luis Obispo | 1,791\n | 7.2 | June 20, 2015 | June 24, 2015 |  | [15] |\n| North | San Bernardino | 4,250\n | 17.2 | July 17, 2015 | July 21, 2015 | 7 houses and 44 vehicles destroyed | [16] |\n| Wragg | Napa | 8,051\n | 32.6 | July 22, 2015 | August 6, 2015 |  | [17] |\n| Rocky | Lake | 69,438\n | 281.0 | July 29, 2015 | August 14, 2015 |  | [18] |\n| Fork Complex | Shasta | 36,503\n | 147.7 | July 30, 2015 | November 3, 2015 |  | [19][20] |\n| River Complex | Trinity | 77,081\n | 311.9 | July 30, 2015 | October 29, 2015 |  | [21] |\n| Frog | Lassen | 4,863\n | 19.7 | July 30, 2015 | August 20, 2015 | 1 firefighter killed | [22] |\n| Humboldt Lightning | Humboldt | 4,883\n | 19.8 | July 30, 2015 | August 19, 2015 |  | [23] |\n| Mad River Complex | Humboldt | 73,137\n | 296.0 | July 30, 2015 | September 13, 2015 | includes Route Complex Fire | [24] |\n| Rough | Fresno | 151,623\n | 613.6 | July 31, 2015 | November 5, 2015 |  | [25] |\n| Dodge | Lassen | 10,570\n | 42.8 | August 3, 2015 | August 17, 2015 |  | [26] |\n| Gasquet | Del Norte | 30,361\n | 122.9 | August 3, 2015 | October 15, 2015 | Fires: Feeder (100%), Coon (100%), Bear (100%) and Peak (100% containment) | [27] |\n| Jerusalem | Lake and Napa | 25,118\n | 101.6 | August 9, 2015 | August 25, 2015 |  | [28] |\n| Cabin | Glendora | 1,723\n | 7.0 | August 14, 2015 | November 20, 2015 | 5 structures destroyed | [29] |\n| Cuesta | San Luis Obispo | 2,446\n | 9.9 | August 16, 2015 | August 28, 2015 |  | [30] |\n| Tesla | Alameda | 2,700\n | 10.9 | August 19, 2015 | August 22, 2015 |  | [31] |\n| Butte | Amador | 70,868\n | 286.8 | September 9, 2015 | October 1, 2015 | 2 civilians fatalities475 residences & 343 outbuildings destroyed | [32] |\n| Valley | Lake | 76,067\n | 307.8 | September 12, 2015 | October 15, 2015 | 4 civilian fatalities, 1,955 structures destroyed; 6th most destructive wildfire in modern California history (as of 2022)[33] | [34] |\n| Tassajara | Monterey | 1,086\n | 4.4 | September 19, 2015 | September 27, 2015 | 1 civilian fatality | [35] |\n| Solimar | Ventura | 1,388\n | 5.6 | December 25, 2015 | December 29, 2015 | 1 minor ankle injury[36] | [37] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of California wildfires\n* 2015 Oregon wildfires\n* 2015 Washington wildfires\n* Climate change in California\n* 2014\u201315 North American winter\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"National Report of Wildland Fires and Acres Burned by State 2015\" (PDF). *National Interagency Fire Center*.
