It was found in a remote area of Redwood National Park that was part of the original 1968 park boundaries. The park also houses the second, fourth and fifth tallest known trees, coast redwoods named Helios, Icarus, and Daedalus, currently 377, 371 and 363 feet, respectively.[6][7][8] Hyperion was measured as 116.07 metres (380.8\u00a0ft) tall in 2019.[2]\n\n\nHyperion is estimated to be 600 to 800 years old[2][8][9] and contain 530\u00a0m3 (18,600\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of wood.[3]\n\n\nThe exact location of Hyperion is nominally secret but is available via internet search.[10] However, In July\u00a02022, the Redwood Park superintendent closed the entire area around the tree, citing \"devastation of the habitat surrounding Hyperion\" caused by visitors, and now anyone who gets too close could face up to six months in jail and a $5,000 fine.[1][11][12]\n\n\nResearchers have said that woodpecker activity at the top may have prevented the tree from growing taller.[9]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2012, Hyperion was featured in the BBC Radio 4 documentary, *James and the Giant Redwoods*, by James Aldred.[13]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of superlative trees\n* List of individual trees\n* List of tallest trees\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Should I Hike to Hyperion?\". *Redwood National Park*.

The tree was first measured by climber-deployed tapeline at 99.6 metres (327\u00a0ft) tall in 2008, and was subsequently re-measured to be 100.5 metres (330\u00a0ft) tall by ground laser in 2018.[2][3][1] This discovery places *E. regnans* as the third-tallest tree species in the world after the coast redwood and the Shorea faguetiana, and taller than both the Sitka spruce and Coastal Douglas Fir.[4][5]\nIt was discovered in August 2008 by employees of Forestry Tasmania while analysing the data collected by LiDAR system used in mapping and assessment of state forest resources.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Condition[edit]\n\n\nThe tree is in a small patch of very old forest surrounded by secondary forest and has survived logging and forest fires by coincidence. Near Centurion grew two other giant trees: the 86.5 metre tall *E. regnans* named Triarius and The Prefect which had a girth of 19m until destroyed in the 2019 fires.[7]\n\n\nIn February 2019 it was damaged from a bushfire that devastated the surrounding area but appears to have initially survived. A new hollow in the base was created by the fire.[8]\n\n\n\n## Height[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tallest trees\n\nTwo more recent measurements indicated that the tree was growing, albeit very slowly. In January 2014 the tree was climbed and the tape drop indicated the tree had grown to 99.82m. However, a further tape drop done in 2016 obtained the slightly lower height of 99.67m.[9] Centurion was re-measured again by ground laser in December 2018 and was found to have possibly reached 100.5 meters in height.[1]\n\n\nThe diameter of Centurion is 4.05 metres, its girth exceeds 12 metres, and its volume has been estimated at 268 cubic metres. The name \"Centurion\" was saved for the hundredth noble tree to be discovered by Forestry Tasmania and coincided with the height of the tree. Named after centurions (Roman officers), the root of the name contains *centum*, which in Latin means \"one hundred\". Centurion is alternately known as \"the Bradman\" as the height of the tree at 99.82 metres was close to the Test run average of the Australian cricketer Donald Bradman.[10]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of individual trees\n* List of tallest trees\n* List of named *Eucalyptus* trees\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"100 metres and growing: Australia's tallest tree leaves all others in the shade\". *ABC News*. 2018-12-11.

Common names include **coast redwood**, **coastal redwood** and **California redwood**. It is an evergreen, long-lived, monoecious tree living 1,200\u20132,200 years or more.[4] This species includes the tallest living trees on Earth, reaching up to 115.9\u00a0m (380.1\u00a0ft) in height (without the roots) and up to 8.9\u00a0m (29\u00a0ft) in diameter at breast height. These trees are also among the longest-living organisms on Earth. Before commercial logging and clearing began by the 1850s, this massive tree occurred naturally in an estimated 810,000\u00a0ha (2,000,000 acres)[5][6][7] along much of coastal California (excluding southern California where rainfall is not sufficient) and the southwestern corner of coastal Oregon within the United States.\n\n\nThe name **sequoia** sometimes refers to the subfamily Sequoioideae, which includes *S.\u00a0sempervirens* along with *Sequoiadendron* (giant sequoia) and *Metasequoia* (dawn redwood). Here, the term **redwood** on its own refers to the species covered in this article but not to the other two species.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\nThe coast redwood is known to have reached 115.5\u00a0m (379\u00a0ft) tall, with a trunk diameter of 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft).[8] It has a conical crown, with horizontal to slightly drooping branches. The trunk is remarkably straight. The bark can be very thick, up to 30\u00a0cm (1\u00a0ft), and quite soft and fibrous, with a bright red-brown color when freshly exposed (hence the name redwood), weathering darker. The root system is composed of shallow, wide-spreading lateral roots.\n\n\nThe leaves are variable, being 15\u201325\u00a0mm (5\u20448\u20131\u00a0in) long and flat on young trees and shaded lower branches in older trees. The leaves are scalelike, 5\u201310\u00a0mm (1\u20444\u20133\u20448\u00a0in) long on shoots in full sun in the upper crown of older trees, with a full range of transition between the two extremes. They are dark green above and have two blue-white stomatal bands below. Leaf arrangement is spiral, but the larger shade leaves are twisted at the base to lie in a flat plane for maximum light capture.\n\n\nThe species is monoecious, with pollen and seed cones on the same plant. The seed cones are ovoid, 15\u201332\u00a0mm (9\u204416\u20131+1\u20444\u00a0in) long, with 15\u201325 spirally arranged scales; pollination is in late winter with maturation about 8\u20139 months after. Each cone scale bears three to seven seeds, each seed 3\u20134\u00a0mm (1\u20448\u20133\u204416\u00a0in) long and 0.5\u00a0mm (1\u204432\u00a0in) broad, with two wings 1\u00a0mm (1\u204416\u00a0in) wide. The seeds are released when the cone scales dry and open at maturity. The pollen cones are ovular and 4\u20136\u00a0mm (3\u204416\u20131\u20444\u00a0in) long.\n\n\nIts genetic makeup is unusual among conifers, being a hexaploid (6n) and possibly allopolyploid (AAAABB).[9] Both the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of the redwood are paternally inherited.[10]\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nScottish botanist David Don described the redwood as the evergreen taxodium (*Taxodium sempervirens*) in his colleague Aylmer Bourke Lambert's 1824 work *A description of the genus Pinus*.[11] Austrian botanist Stephan Endlicher erected the genus *Sequoia* in his 1847 work *Synopsis coniferarum*, giving the redwood its current binomial name of *Sequoia sempervirens*.[12] It is unknown how Endlicher derived the name Sequoia. See *Sequoia* Etymology.\n\n\nThe redwood is one of three living species, each in its own genus, in the subfamily Sequoioideae. Molecular studies have shown that the three are each other's closest relatives, generally with the redwood and giant sequoia (*Sequoiadendron giganteum*) as each other's closest relatives.\n\n\nHowever, Yang and colleagues in 2010 queried the polyploid state of the redwood and speculate that it may have arisen as an ancient hybrid between ancestors of the giant sequoia and dawn redwood (*Metasequoia*). Using two different single copy nuclear genes, LFY and NLY, to generate phylogenetic trees, they found that *Sequoia* was clustered with *Metasequoia* in the tree generated using the LFY gene, but with *Sequoiadendron* in the tree generated with the NLY gene. Further analysis strongly supported the hypothesis that *Sequoia* was the result of a hybridization event involving *Metasequoia* and *Sequoiadendron*. Thus, Yang and colleagues hypothesize that the inconsistent relationships among *Metasequoia*, *Sequoia,* and *Sequoiadendron* could be a sign of reticulate evolution (in which two species hybridize and give rise to a third) among the three genera. However, the long evolutionary history of the three genera (the earliest fossil remains being from the Jurassic) make resolving the specifics of when and how *Sequoia* originated once and for all a difficult matter\u2014especially since it in part depends on an incomplete fossil record.[13]\n\n\n\n### Names[edit]\n\n\nThe species name \"sempervirens\" means \"evergreen\", thought to be because of its previous placement in the same genus as the bald cyprus, which loses its leaves in winter in contrast to the evergreen foliage of the coast redwood.[14] The common name \"redwood\", applied to both the coast redwood and the giant redwood, is a reference to the red heartwood of the trees.[15] Common names that refer to *Sequoia sempervirens* alone include \"California redwood\", \"coastal redwood\", \"coastal sequoia\", and \"coast redwood\".[16]\n\n\n\n## Distribution and habitat[edit]\n\n\nCoast redwoods occupy a narrow strip of land approximately 750\u00a0km (470\u00a0mi) in length and 8\u201375\u00a0km (5\u201347\u00a0mi) in width along the Pacific coast of North America; the most southerly grove is in Monterey County, California, and the most northerly groves are in extreme southwestern Oregon. The prevailing elevation range is 30\u2013750\u00a0m (100\u20132,460\u00a0ft) above sea level, occasionally down to 0 and up to about 900\u00a0m (3,000\u00a0ft).[17] They usually grow in the mountains where precipitation from the incoming moisture off the ocean is greater. The tallest and oldest trees are found in deep valleys and gullies, where year-round streams can flow, and fog drip is regular. The terrain also made it harder for loggers to get to the trees and to get them out after felling. The trees above the fog layer, above about 700\u00a0m (2,300\u00a0ft), are shorter and smaller due to the drier, windier, and colder conditions. In addition, Douglas-fir, pine, and tanoak often crowd out redwoods at these elevations. Few redwoods grow close to the ocean, due to intense salt spray, sand, and wind. Coalescence of coastal fog accounts for a considerable part of the trees' water needs.[18] Fog in the 21st century is, however, reduced from what it was in the prior century, which is a problem that may be compounded by climate change.[19]\n\n\nThe northern boundary of its range is marked by two groves on mountain slopes along the north side of the Chetco River,[20] which is on the western fringe of the Klamath Mountains, near the California\u2013Oregon border.[21][22] The northernmost grove is located within Alfred A. Loeb State Park and Siskiyou National Forest at the approximate coordinates 42\u00b007'36\"N 124\u00b012'17\"W. The southern boundary of its range is the Los Padres National Forest's Silver Peak Wilderness in the Santa Lucia Mountains of the Big Sur area of Monterey County, California. The southernmost grove is in the Southern Redwood Botanical Area, just north of the national forest's Salmon Creek trailhead and near the San Luis Obispo County line.[23][24]\n\n\nThe largest and tallest populations are in California's Redwood National and State Parks (Del Norte and Humboldt counties) and Humboldt Redwoods State Park, with the overall majority located in the large Humboldt County.\n\n\nThe ancient range of the genus is considerably greater, with relatives of the coast redwood living in Europe and Asia prior to the Quaternary geologic period. In recent geologic time there have been considerable shifts in the coast redwood's range in North America. Coast redwood bark has been found in the La Brea Tar Pits, showing that 25,000\u201340,000 years before the present redwood trees grew as far south as the Los Angeles during the last ice age.[25][26] The authors of a 2022 paper suggest, \"Were it not for the remarkable ability to sprout after fire, many southern forests may have lost their *Sequoia* component long ago.\"[27] As to previous redwood range to the north, an upright fossil stump of a coast redwood on a beach in central Oregon was documented 257 km north of the current range.[28]\n\n\n\n### Assisted migration[edit]\n\n\nThe ability of Coast Redwood to live for more than a thousand years, along with its unusual capacity to resprout from its root crown when felled by natural or human causes, have earned this species the label of \"carbon-sequestration champion.\"[29] Its potential to contribute toward climate change mitigation, as well as its demonstrated ability to thrive in coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest,[30][31] led to the formation of a citizen group in Seattle, Washington undertaking assisted migration of this species hundreds of miles north of its native range.[32][33]\n\n\n\nIn contrast to cautionary statements made by forestry professionals assessing other tree species for assisted migration,[34] the citizens involved with the group known as PropagationNation have met with little controversy. As reported in 2023,\n\n\n> \n> Not wanting to cause ecological problems by planting the trees across the Pacific Northwest, [Philip] Stielstra would eventually contact one of the foremost experts on the coast redwood, a botanist and forest ecologist named Stephen Sillett, at Cal Poly Humboldt, and ask if moving redwoods north was safe. Sillett thought planting redwoods around Seattle was a fantastic idea. (\"It's not like it's going to escape and become a nuisance species,\" Sillett told me, before adding, \"it just has so many benefits.\") Another factor encouraged Stielstra too: Millions of years ago, redwoods \u2014 or their close relatives \u2014 grew across the Pacific Northwest. By moving them, Stielstra reasoned, he was helping the magnificent trees regain lost territory.[32]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 2022 a Canadian Forestry Service publication used northward horticultural plantings, along with a review of research detailing redwood's paleobiogeography and current range conditions, as grounds for proposing that Canada's Vancouver Island already offered \"narrow strips of optimal habitat\" for extending the range of coast redwood.[35] The authors point to a topographical \"bottleneck\" north of the California border that could have impeded northward migration during the Holocene. The bottleneck entails a lack of lowland passages through an east-west mountain range in southern Oregon, coupled with the absence of coastal landscapes beyond storm salt-spray and tsunami inundation \u2014 for which this conifer species is highly intolerant.\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fog is of major importance in coast redwood ecology. Redwood National Park.\nThe native area provides a unique environment with heavy seasonal rains up to 2,500\u00a0mm (100\u00a0in) annually. Cool coastal air and fog drip keep the forest consistently damp year round. Several factors, including the heavy rainfall, create a soil with fewer nutrients than the trees need, causing them to depend heavily on the entire biotic community of the forest, and making efficient recycling of dead trees especially important. This forest community includes coast Douglas-fir, Pacific madrone, tanoak, western hemlock, and other trees, along with a wide variety of ferns, mosses, mushrooms, and redwood sorrel. Redwood forests provide habitat for a variety of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles. Old-growth redwood stands provide habitat for the federally threatened spotted owl and the California-endangered marbled murrelet.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cross section of a Sequoia sempervirens showing tree rings\nCoast redwoods are resistant to insect attack, fungal infection, and rot. These properties are conferred by concentrations of terpenoids and tannic acid in redwood leaves, roots, bark, and wood.[36] Despite these chemical defenses, redwoods are still subject to insect infestations; none, however, are capable of killing a healthy tree.[36] Redwoods also face herbivory from mammals: black bears are reported to consume the inner bark of small redwoods, and black-tailed deer are known to eat redwood sprouts.[36]\n\n\nThe oldest known coast redwood is about 2,200 years old;[37] many others in the wild exceed 600 years. The numerous claims of older redwoods are incorrect.[37] Because of their seemingly timeless lifespans, coast redwoods were deemed the \"everlasting redwood\" at the turn of the century; in Latin, *sempervirens* means \"ever green\" or \"everlasting\". Redwoods must endure various environmental disturbances to attain such great ages.\n\n\nIn response to forest fires, the trees have developed various adaptations. The thick, fibrous bark of coast redwoods is extremely fire-resistant; it grows to at least a foot thick and protects mature trees from fire damage.[38][39] In addition, the redwoods contain little flammable pitch or resin.[39] If damaged by fire, a redwood readily sprouts new branches or even an entirely new crown,[38][36] and if the parent tree is killed, new buds sprout from its base.[36] Fires, moreover, appear to actually benefit redwoods by causing substantial mortality in competing species while having only minor effects on redwood. Burned areas are favorable to the successful germination of redwood seeds.[38] A study published in 2010, the first to compare post-wildfire survival and regeneration of redwood and associated species, concluded fires of all severity increase the relative abundance of redwood and higher-severity fires provide the greatest benefit.[40]\n\n\nRedwoods often grow in flood-prone areas. Sediment deposits can form impermeable barriers that suffocate tree roots, and unstable soil in flooded areas often causes trees to lean to one side, increasing the risk of the wind toppling them. Immediately after a flood, redwoods grow their existing roots upwards into recently deposited sediment layers.[41] A second root system then develops from adventitious buds on the newly buried trunk and the old root system dies.[41] To counter lean, redwoods increase wood production on the vulnerable side, creating a supporting buttress.[41] These adaptations create forests of almost exclusively redwood trees in flood-prone regions.[36][41]\n\n\nThe height of *S.\u00a0sempervirens* is closely tied to fog availability; taller trees become less frequent as fog becomes less frequent.[42] As *S.\u00a0sempervirens*' height increases, transporting water via water potential to the leaves becomes increasingly difficult due to gravity.[43][44][45] Despite the high rainfall that the region receives (up to 100\u00a0cm), the leaves in the upper canopy are perpetually stressed for water.[46][47] This water stress is exacerbated by long droughts in the summer.[48] Water stress is believed to cause the morphological changes in the leaves, stimulating reduced leaf length and increased leaf succulence.[44][49] To supplement their water needs, redwoods use frequent summer fog events. Fog water is absorbed through multiple pathways. Leaves directly take in fog from the surrounding air through the epidermal tissue, bypassing the xylem.[50][51] Coast redwoods also absorb water directly through their bark.[52] The uptake of water through leaves and bark repairs and reduces the severity of xylem embolisms,[53][52] which occur when cavitations form in the xylem preventing the transport of water and nutrients.[52] Fog may also collect on redwood leaves, drip to the forest floor, and be absorbed by the tree's roots. This fog drip may form 30% of the total water used by a tree in a year.[48]\n\n\n\n### Reproduction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Redwood cone scales begin to open mid November, with seeds dispersing by the wind.\n![](image)Basal regrowth after logging, Freshwater Creek (east of Eureka, California). While standing in the creek, a portion of the old stump can be seen.\n![](image)View upward from the center of an old, logged stump (Freshwater Creek).\nCoast redwood reproduces both sexually by seed and asexually by sprouting of buds, layering, or lignotubers. Seed production begins at 10\u201315 years of age. Cones develop in the winter and mature by fall. In the early stages, the cones look like flowers, and are commonly called \"flowers\" by professional foresters, although this is not strictly correct. Coast redwoods produce many cones, with redwoods in new forests producing thousands per year.[38] The cones themselves hold 90\u2013150 seeds, but viability of seed is low, typically well below 15% with one estimate of average rates being 3 to 10 percent.[54][38] The low viability may discourage seed predators, which do not want to waste time sorting chaff (empty seeds) from edible seeds. Successful germination often requires a fire or flood, reducing competition for seedlings. The winged seeds are small and light, weighing 3.3\u20135.0\u00a0mg (200\u2013300 seeds/g; 5,600\u20138,500/ounce). The wings are not effective for wide dispersal, and seeds are dispersed by wind an average of only 60\u2013120\u00a0m (200\u2013390\u00a0ft) from the parent tree. Seedlings are susceptible to fungal infection and predation by banana slugs, brush rabbits, and nematodes.[36] Most seedlings do not survive their first three years.[38] However, those that become established grow rapidly, with young trees known to reach 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) tall in 20 years.\n\n\nCoast redwoods can also reproduce asexually by layering or sprouting from the root crown, stump, or even fallen branches; if a tree falls over, it generates a row of new trees along the trunk, so many trees naturally grow in a straight line. Sprouts originate from dormant or adventitious buds at or under the surface of the bark. The dormant sprouts are stimulated when the main adult stem gets damaged or starts to die. Many sprouts spontaneously erupt and develop around the circumference of the tree trunk. Within a short period after sprouting, each sprout develops its own root system, with the dominant sprouts forming a ring of trees around the parent root crown or stump. This ring of trees is called a \"fairy ring\". Sprouts can achieve heights of 2.3\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) in a single growing season.\n\n\nRedwoods may also reproduce using burls. A burl is a woody lignotuber that commonly appears on a redwood tree below the soil line, though usually within 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) in depth from the soil surface. Coast redwoods develop burls as seedlings from the axils of their cotyledon, a trait that is extremely rare in conifers.[38] When provoked by damage, dormant buds in the burls sprout new shoots and roots. Burls are also capable of sprouting into new trees when detached from the parent tree, though exactly how this happens is yet to be studied. Shoot clones commonly sprout from burls and are often turned into decorative hedges when found in suburbia.\n\n\n\n## Cultivation and uses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An example of a bonsai redwood, from the Pacific Bonsai Museum\nCoast redwood is one of the most valuable timber species in the lumbering industry. In California, 3,640\u00a0km2 (899,000 acres) of redwood forest are logged, virtually all of it second growth.[1] Though many entities have existed in the cutting and management of redwoods, perhaps none has had a more storied role than the Pacific Lumber Company (1863\u20132008) of Humboldt County, California, where it owned and managed over 810\u00a0km2 (200,000 acres) of forests, primarily redwood. Coast redwood lumber is highly valued for its beauty, light weight, and resistance to decay. Its lack of resin makes it absorb water[55] and resist fire.\n\n\nP. H. Shaughnessy, Chief Engineer of the San Francisco Fire Department wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> In the recent great fire of San Francisco, that began April 18th, 1906, we succeeded in finally stopping it in nearly all directions where the unburned buildings were almost entirely of frame construction, and if the exterior finish of these buildings had not been of redwood lumber, I am satisfied that the area of the burned district would have been greatly extended.\n> \n> \n\n\nBecause of its impressive resistance to decay, redwood was extensively used for railroad ties and trestles throughout California. Many of the old ties have been recycled for use in gardens as borders, steps, house beams, etc. Redwood burls are used in the production of table tops, veneers, and turned goods.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail passing through a cut-out in a fallen California redwood tree\nThe Yurok people, who occupied the region before European settlement, regularly burned ground cover in redwood forests to bolster tanoak populations from which they harvested acorns, to maintain forest openings, and to boost populations of useful plant species such as those for medicine or basketmaking.[36]\n\n\nExtensive logging of redwoods began in the early nineteenth century. The trees were felled by ax and saw onto beds of tree limbs and shrubs to cushion their fall.[36] Stripped of their bark, the logs were transported to mills or waterways by oxen or horse.[36] Loggers then burned the accumulated tree limbs, shrubs, and bark. The repeated fires favored secondary forests of primarily redwoods as redwood seedlings sprout readily in burned areas.[36][56] The introduction of steam engines let crews drag logs through long skid trails to nearby railroads,[36] furthering the reach of loggers beyond the land near rivers previously used to transport trees.[56] This method of harvesting, however, disturbed large amounts of soil, producing secondary-growth forests of species other than redwood such as Douglas-fir, grand fir, and western hemlock.[36] After World War II, trucks and tractors gradually replaced steam engines, giving rise to two harvesting approaches: clearcutting and selection harvesting. Clearcutting involved felling all the trees in a particular area. It was encouraged by tax laws that exempted all standing timber from taxation if 70% of trees in the area were harvested.[36] Selection logging, by contrast, called for the removal 25% to 50% of mature trees in the hopes that the remaining trees would allow for future growth and reseeding.[56] This method, however, encouraged growth of other tree species, converting redwood forests into mixed forests of redwood, grand fir, Sitka spruce, and western hemlock.[56][36] Moreover, the trees left standing were often felled by windthrow; that is, they were often blown over by the wind.\n\n\nThe coast redwood is naturalized in New Zealand, notably at Whakarewarewa Forest, Rotorua.[57] Redwood has been grown in New Zealand plantations for more than 100 years, and those planted in New Zealand have higher growth rates than those in California, mainly because of even rainfall distribution through the year.[58]\n\n\nOther areas of successful cultivation outside of the native range include Great Britain, Italy, France,[59] Haida Gwaii, middle elevations of Hawaii, Hogsback in South Africa, the Knysna Afromontane forests in the Western Cape, Grootvadersbosch Forest Reserve near Swellendam, South Africa and the Tokai Arboretum on the slopes of Table Mountain above Cape Town, a small area in central Mexico (Jilotepec), and the southeastern United States from eastern Texas to Maryland. It also does well in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia), far north of its northernmost native range in southwestern Oregon. Coast redwood trees were used in a display at Rockefeller Center and then given to Longhouse Reserve in East Hampton, Long Island, New York, and these have now been living there for over twenty years and have survived at 2\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221217\u00a0\u00b0C).[60]\n\n\nThis fast-growing tree can be grown as an ornamental specimen in those large parks and gardens that can accommodate its massive size. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[61][62]\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dried resin\n![The foliage of an \"albino\" exhibiting lack of chlorophyll](image)\"Albinos\" lack chlorophyll\nFairly solid evidence indicates that coast redwoods were the world's largest trees before logging, with numerous historical specimens reportedly over 122\u00a0m (400\u00a0ft).[63]:\u200a16,\u200a42 The theoretical maximum potential height of coast redwoods is thought to be limited to between 122 and 130\u00a0m (400 and 427\u00a0ft), as evapotranspiration is insufficient to transport water to leaves beyond this range.[43] Further studies have indicated that this maximum requires fog, which is prevalent in these trees' natural environment.[64]\n\n\nA tree reportedly 114.3\u00a0m (375\u00a0ft) in length was felled in Sonoma County by the Murphy Brothers saw mill in the 1870s,[65] another claimed to be 115.8\u00a0m (380\u00a0ft) and 7.9\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) in diameter was cut down near Eureka in 1914,[66][67] and the Lindsey Creek tree was documented to have a height of 120\u00a0m (390\u00a0ft) when it was uprooted and felled by a storm in 1905. A tree reportedly 129.2\u00a0m (424\u00a0ft) tall was felled in November 1886 by the Elk River Mill and Lumber Company in Humboldt County, yielding 79,736 marketable board feet from 21 cuts.[68][69][70] In 1893, a Redwood cut at the Eel River, near Scotia, reportedly measured 130.1\u00a0m (427\u00a0ft) in length, and 23.5\u00a0m (77\u00a0ft) in girth.[71][72][73] However, limited evidence corroborates these historical measurements.\n\n\nToday, trees over 60\u00a0m (200\u00a0ft) are common, and many are over 90\u00a0m (300\u00a0ft). The current tallest tree is the Hyperion tree, measuring 115.61\u00a0m (379.3\u00a0ft).[37] The tree was discovered in Redwood National Park during mid-2006 by Chris Atkins and Michael Taylor, and is thought to be the world's tallest living organism. The previous record holder was the Stratosphere Giant in Humboldt Redwoods State Park at 112.84\u00a0m (370.2\u00a0ft) (as measured in 2004). Until it fell in March 1991, the \"Dyerville Giant\" was the record holder. It, too, stood in Humboldt Redwoods State Park and was 113.4\u00a0m (372\u00a0ft) high and estimated to be 1,600\u00a0years old. This fallen giant has been preserved in the park.\n\n\nThe largest known living coast redwood is Grogan's Fault, discovered in 2014 by Chris Atkins and Mario Vaden in Redwood National Park,[37] with a main trunk volume of at least 1,084.5 cubic meters (38,299\u00a0cu\u00a0ft)[37] Other high-volume coast redwoods include Iluvatar, with a main trunk volume of 1,033\u00a0m3 (36,470\u00a0cu\u00a0ft),[63]:\u200a160 and the Lost Monarch, with a main trunk volume of 988.7\u00a0m3 (34,914\u00a0cu\u00a0ft).[74]\n\n\nAlbino redwoods are mutants that cannot manufacture chlorophyll. About 230 examples (including growths and sprouts) are known to exist,[75] reaching heights of up to 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft).[76] These trees survive like parasites, obtaining food from green parent trees. While similar mutations occur sporadically in other conifers, no cases are known of such individuals surviving to maturity in any other conifer species.[*citation needed*] Recent research news reports that albino redwoods can store higher concentrations of toxic metals, going so far as comparing them to organs or \"waste dumps\".[77][78]\n\n\n\n### List of tallest trees[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tallest trees\n\nHeights of the tallest coast redwoods are measured yearly by experts.[37] Even with recent discoveries of tall coast redwoods above 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft), it is likely that no taller trees will be discovered.[37]\n\n\n\n\n\nTen tallest *Sequoia sempervirens*[37]\n| Rank\n | Name\n | Height\n | Diameter\n | Location\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meters\n | Feet\n | Meters\n | Feet\n |\n| 1\n | Hyperion | 115.85\n | 380.1\n | 4.84\n | 15.9\n | Redwood National Park |\n| 2\n | Helios\n | 114.58\n | 375.9\n | 4.96\n | 16.3\n | Redwood National Park |\n| 3\n | Icarus\n | 113.14\n | 371.2\n | 3.78\n | 12.4\n | Redwood National Park |\n| 4\n | Stratosphere Giant | 113.05\n | 370.9\n | 5.18\n | 17.0\n | Humboldt Redwoods State Park |\n| 5\n | National Geographic\n | 112.71\n | 369.8\n | 4.39\n | 14.4\n | Redwood National Park |\n| 6\n | Orion\n | 112.63\n | 369.5\n | 4.33\n | 14.2\n | Redwood National Park |\n| 7\n | Federation Giant\n | 112.62\n | 369.5\n | 4.54\n | 14.9\n | Humboldt Redwoods State Park |\n| 8\n | Paradox\n | 112.51\n | 369.1\n | 3.90\n | 12.8\n | Humboldt Redwoods State Park |\n| 9\n | Mendocino | 112.32\n | 368.5\n | 4.19\n | 13.7\n | Montgomery Woods State Natural Reserve |\n| 10\n | Millennium\n | 111.92\n | 367.2\n | 2.71\n | 8.9\n | Humboldt Redwoods State Park |\n\n![](image)The Del Norte Titan\nDiameter is measured at 1.4\u00a0m (4\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) above average ground level (at breast height).

This is partly due to technical difficulties in measurement, and variations in the shape of trees and their trunks. Measurements of trunk circumference are taken at only a few predetermined heights up the trunk, and assume that the trunk is circular in cross-section, and that taper between measurement points is even. Also, only the volume of the trunk (including the restored volume of basal fire scars) is taken into account, and not the volume of wood in the branches or roots.[80] The volume measurements also do not take cavities into account. Most coast redwoods with volumes greater than 850\u00a0m3 (30,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) represent ancient fusions of two or more separate trees, which makes determining whether a coast redwood has a single stem or multiple stems difficult.[81] Starting in 2014, more record-breaking coast redwood trees were discovered. The largest disclosed was a massive redwood called Grogan's Fault/Spartan,[82] which has been measured to have a volume of 38,300 cubic feet. In 2021 during a meeting presentation titled Redwoods 101 run by Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park, an even larger redwood was revealed, allegedly surpassed only by 3 giant sequoias in size.[83] This tree is popularly known as 'Hail Storm', and has a volume of 44,750 cubic feet.[84]\n\n\nDetails of the precise locations for most of the tallest trees were not announced to the general public for fear of causing damage to the trees and the surrounding habitat.[37] The largest coast redwood easily accessible to the public is Iluvatar, which stands prominently about 5 meters (16\u00a0ft) to the southeast of the Foothill Trail of Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park.\n\n\n\n### Canopy Layers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)**Clouded Salamander, *Aneides ferreus***\nRedwood canopy soil forms from leaf and organic material litter shedding from upper portions of the tree, accumulating and decomposing on larger branches.[85] These clusters of soil require a lot of hydration, but they have an incredible amount of retention once saturated. Redwoods can send roots into these wet soils, providing a water source removed from the forest floor. This creates a unique ecosystem within old growth trees full of fungi, vascular plants, and small creatures. An example of a creature that lives there are the Clouded Salamanders that has been discovered up to 40 meters high. Evidence shows they breed and are born in the canopy soil of Redwood trees.[85] Due to the sheer mass height of these trees and the canopy layer, it was almost never explored for the last century. Due to the mass of these trees and the amount of trees in the surrounding area different molds of moss form on these canopies that are called epiphytes. These epiphytes have different characteristics but all of said species are very adaptable to the tough treetop weather and characteristics.[85] After hundreds of years these trees have been shaped into making it possible for these epiphytes to survive through the winter rain and the fall fog.[85] \u00a0\n\n\n\n### Other notable examples[edit]\n\n\n* The Blossom Rock Navigation Trees were two especially tall sequoias located in the Berkeley Hills used as a navigational aid by sailors to avoid the treacherous Blossom Rock near Yerba Buena Island.[86]\n* The Crannell Creek Giant was documented to have a trunk volume of at least 1,744\u00a0m3 (61,573\u00a0cu\u00a0ft)\u00a0\u2013 about 32% larger than Grogan's Fault and 17% larger than General Sherman, the current largest tree. It was felled around 1945.[37][87]\n* The Lindsey Creek tree was documented to have a height of 120\u00a0m (390\u00a0ft) and a trunk volume of at least 2,500 cubic meters (90,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) when it was uprooted and felled by a storm in 1905. If these measurements are to be believed, the Lindsey Creek tree was about 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) taller than Hyperion, the current tallest tree, 213% larger than Grogan's Fault, and 171% larger than General Sherman.[37][88]\n* Old Survivor, also known as the Grandfather, is the last remaining old-growth coastal redwood of the redwood forest that populated the Oakland Hills. The tree was seeded sometime between 1549 and 1554.[89]\n* One of the largest redwood stumps ever found, measuring 9.4\u00a0m (31\u00a0ft) in diameter, is in Oakland, California, the Berkeley Hills, in the Roberts Regional Recreation Area section of Redwood Regional Park.[90][91]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* *Bury Me in Redwood Country*\n* Save the Redwoods League\n* Northern California coastal forests\n* Pacific temperate rainforests\n* Redwood (color)\n* Stephen C.

It is a straight-trunked tree with smooth grey bark, but with a stocking of rough brown bark at the base, glossy green, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between nine and fifteen, white flowers, and cup-shaped or conical fruit. It is the tallest of all flowering plants; the tallest measured living specimen, named Centurion, stands 100 metres (330 feet) tall in Tasmania.\n\n\nIt often grows in pure stands in tall wet forest, sometimes with rainforest understorey, and in temperate, high rainfall areas with deep loam soils. A large number of the trees have been logged, including some of the tallest known. This species of eucalypt does not possess a lignotuber and is often killed by bushfire, regenerating from seed. Mature forests dominated by *E. regnans* have been found to store more carbon than any other forest known. The species is grown in plantations in Australia and in other countries. Along with *E. obliqua* and *E. delegatensis* it is known in the timber industry as Tasmanian oak.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n*Eucalyptus regnans* is a broad-leaved, evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 70\u2013114\u00a0m (230\u2013374\u00a0ft) but does not form a lignotuber. The crown is open and small in relation to the size of the rest of the tree. The trunk is straight with smooth, cream-coloured, greyish or brown bark with a stocking of more or less fibrous or flaky bark that extends up to 5\u201320\u00a0m (16\u201366\u00a0ft) at the base. The trunk typically reaches a diameter of 2.5\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) at breast height (DBH). Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green, egg-shaped leaves that are held horizontally, 55\u2013120\u00a0mm (2.2\u20134.7\u00a0in) long and 22\u201350\u00a0mm (0.87\u20131.97\u00a0in) wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to broadly lance-shaped or sickle-shaped, 90\u2013230\u00a0mm (3.5\u20139.1\u00a0in) long and 15\u201350\u00a0mm (0.59\u20131.97\u00a0in) wide, tapering to a reddish petiole 8\u201325\u00a0mm (0.31\u20130.98\u00a0in) long. The upper and lower surfaces of the leaves are dotted with numerous tiny, circular or irregularly-shaped oil glands. Secondary leaf veins arise at an acute angle from the midvein and tertiary venation is sparse.[3][4][5][6][7]\n\n\nThe flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between nine and fifteen on one or two unbranched peduncles 4\u201314\u00a0mm (0.16\u20130.55\u00a0in) long, the individual buds on pedicels 3\u20137\u00a0mm (0.12\u20130.28\u00a0in) long. Mature buds are oval, 4\u20137\u00a0mm (0.16\u20130.28\u00a0in) long and 2\u20134\u00a0mm (0.079\u20130.157\u00a0in) wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from March to May and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped or conical capsule 5\u20138\u00a0mm (0.20\u20130.31\u00a0in) long and 4\u20137\u00a0mm (0.16\u20130.28\u00a0in) wide on a pedicel 1\u20137\u00a0mm (0.039\u20130.276\u00a0in) long and usually with three valves near the level of the rim. The seeds are pyramid-shaped, 1.5\u20133\u00a0mm (0.059\u20130.118\u00a0in) long with the hilum at the end.[3][4][6][7]\n\n\nSeedlings have kidney shaped cotyledons, and the first two to three pairs of leaves are arranged in opposite pairs along the stem, then alternate.[3][8]\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\n*Eucalyptus regnans* was first formally described in 1871 by Victorian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in the *Annual Report of the Victorian Acclimatisation Society*.[9][10] He gave the specific epithet (*regnans*) from the Latin word meaning \"ruling\".[8] Mueller noted that \"[t]his species or variety, which might be called *Eucalyptus regnans*, represents the loftiest tree in British Territory.\" However, until 1882 he considered the tree to be a form or variety of the Tasmanian black peppermint (*Eucalyptus amygdalina*) and called it thus,[11] not using the binomial name *Eucalyptus regnans* until the *Systematic Census of Australian Plants* in 1882,[12] and giving it a formal diagnosis in 1888 in Volume 1 of the *Key to the System of Victorian Plants*, where he describes it as \"stupendously tall\".[13] Von Mueller did not designate a type specimen, nor did he use the name *Eucalyptus regnans* on his many collections of \"White Mountain Ash\" at the Melbourne Herbarium. Victorian botanist Jim Willis selected a lectotype in 1967, one of the more complete collections of a specimen from the Dandenong Ranges, that von Mueller had noted was one \"of the tall trees measured by Mr D. Boyle in March 1867.\"[11]\n\n\n*Eucalyptus regnans* is widely known as the mountain ash, due to the resemblance of its wood to that of the northern hemisphere ash (*Fraxinus*). Swamp gum is a name given to it in Tasmania, as well as stringy gum in northern Tasmania.[8] Other common names include white mountain ash, giant ash, stringy gum, swamp gum and Tasmanian oak.[9] Von Mueller called it the \"Giant gum-tree\" and \"Spurious blackbutt\" in his 1888 *Key to the System of Victorian Plants*.[13] The timber has been known as \"Tasmanian oak\", because early settlers likened the strength of its wood that of English oak (*Quercus robur*).[14]\n\n\nThe brown barrel (*Eucalyptus fastigata*) is a close relative of mountain ash, with the two sharing the rare trait in eucalypts of paired inflorescences arising from axillary buds. Botanist Ian Brooker classified the two in the series *Regnantes*.[8] The latter species differs in having brown fibrous bark all the way up its trunk, and was long classified as a subspecies of *E. regnans*.[15] The series lies in the section *Eucalyptus* of the subgenus *Eucalyptus* within the genus *Eucalyptus*.[3]\n\n\n\n### Population genetics[edit]\n\n\nGenetic testing across its range of chloroplast DNA by Paul Nevill and colleagues yielded 41 haplotypes, divided broadly into Victorian and Tasmanian groups, but also showing distinct profiles for some areas such as East Gippsland, and north-eastern and south-eastern Tasmania, suggesting the species had persisted in these areas during the Last Glacial Maximum and recolonised others.[16] There was some sharing of haplotypes between populations of the Otway Ranges and north-western Tasmania, suggesting this was the most likely area for gene flow between the mainland and Tasmania in the past.[16] Further analysis of the same chloroplast genetic markers by researchers at The Australian National University suggests that there is more natural haplotype diversity in the Central Highlands of Victoria than previously observed. More recently, next-generation sequencing of nuclear DNA identified very little population genetic structure throughout the range of the species, with a considerable proportion of the entire species genetic variation found within any given population of mountain ash.[17] This suggests that gene flow is likely to be occurring over long distances, and that the lengthy generation times of the species has precluded the development of substantial genetic differentiation between Tasmania and the mainland. Further comparison of chloroplast and nuclear DNA markers confirmed the expectation of extensive pollen dispersal but limited seed dispersal, leading to patterns of strong differentiation in chloroplast markers and weak differentiation at nuclear markers.[18]\n\n\nGenome-wide sequencing of numerous mountain ash populations suggests that hybridisation with messmate (*Eucalyptus obliqua*) occurs frequently, with all populations currently studied having at least one hybrid individual present.[17][15] In many cases these hybrids show no obvious morphological signs of hybridisation, although some individuals do show intermediate phenotypes in characteristics such as the oil gland density in leaves and the structure and height of rough bark on the trunk.[19] Morphology is generally now considered to be a poor method of identifying hybrid individuals as it does not always accurately reflect the genetic makeup of an individual.[20][21] A good example of this is a population of purported mountain ash on Wilson's Promontory in Victoria, which are morphologically more similar to mountain ash but genetically much more closely related to messmate.[17] Other populations with high levels of hybridisation include those on Bruny Island and the Tasman Peninsula in Tasmania.[17] It is not surprising that the populations with the highest level of hybridisation occur on islands, promontories and peninsulas, as these areas are likely to occur on the edge of the ecological niche of mountain ash, and the small patches of mountain ash still remaining at these sites are probably experiencing pollen swamping from the more dominant messmate trees.[22][17] Hybrids between mountain ash and red stringybark (*Eucalyptus macrorhyncha*) have been observed in the Cathedral Range in Victoria.[19] These trees resemble mountain ash in appearance though they lack the paired inflorescences, and have the oil composition of red stringybark.[19]\n\n\n\n## Distribution and habitat[edit]\n\n\n*Eucalyptus regnans* occurs across a 700\u00a0km by 500\u00a0km region in the southern Australian states of Victoria and Tasmania. The species grows mostly in cool, mountainous areas that receive rainfall over 1,000 millimetres (39\u00a0in) per year. *E. regnans* reaches its highest elevations of about 1,100 metres (3,600\u00a0ft) ASL on the Errinundra Plateau in north-eastern Victoria, and its lowest elevations near sea-level in some southern parts of its Tasmanian distribution.[17]\n\n\nIn Victoria, stands of tall trees are found in the Otway, Dandenong, Yarra and Strzelecki ranges as well as Mount Disappointment and East Gippsland.[23] However, the distribution is much reduced. Most of the *E. regnans* forest across Gippsland was cleared for farmland between 1860 and 1880, and in the Otway Ranges between 1880 and 1900, while severe bushfires hit in 1851, 1898 and 1939.[15] In Tasmania, *E. regnans* is found in the Huon and Derwent River valleys in the southeast of the state.[8]\n\n\nIn the Otways, the species is found in wet forest in pure stands or growing in association with mountain grey gum (*Eucalyptus cypellocarpa*), messmate (*E. obliqua*) and Victorian blue gum (*E. globulus* subsp. *bicostata*).[24] Other trees it grows with include manna gum (*Eucalyptus viminalis*), shining gum (*E. nitens*), myrtle beech (*Nothofagus cunninghamii*) and silver wattle (*Acacia dealbata*)[8] The mountain ash-dominated forest can be interspersed with rainforest understory, with such species as southern sassafras (*Atherosperma moschatum*), celery-top pine (*Phyllocladus aspleniifolius*), leatherwood (*Eucryphia lucida*) and horizontal (*Anodopetalum biglandulosum*).[25] The mountain ash is most suited to deep friable clay loam soils, often of volcanic origin; in areas of poorer soils, it can be confined to watercourses and valleys.[8]\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A taxidermied male Leadbeater's possum\n### Tree growth and stand development[edit]\n\n\n*Eucalyptus regnans* is a very fast growing tree, with mean height growth rates in young (< 22 years old) stands ranging from 1 metre (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) to 2 metres (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) per year.[26] In fact, some individuals grow at more than 2 metres (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) per year for the first 20 years of their lives. However, growth rates slow with age, and eventually turn negative as old trees senesce and the tops of the canopy are damaged in high winds, lightning strikes or during fires. Mean tree height after 8 years is about 15 m, and after 22 years is about 33 m.[26] After 50 years, trees are typically about 65 metres (213\u00a0ft) tall. In young stands (< 22 years old), mean stem diameter growth is approximately 0.8 to 2\u00a0cm per year, with half of the total stem diameter growth occurring in the first 90 years of life.[26][27]\n\n\nA number of environmental factors influence the growth and maturation of *E. regnans*, with research showing that the amount of incident solar radiation is positively associated with height and stem diameter growth, and that the amount of sunlight received is strongly negatively correlated with the level of precipitation (although all areas studied still received more than 120 centimetres (47\u00a0in) of rainfall).[26]\n\n\nIn the absence of disturbance events such as high-intensity fire, individual trees can survive for hundreds of years, with the oldest known individuals identified as being 500 years old.[27] Historically, low-frequency and high-intensity wildfires (ignited by lightning strikes) would prevent many stands from reaching this age, with fires killing mature overstorey trees and a new cohort developing from canopy-stored seedbanks. Despite this, natural variation in the spatial scale and frequency of wildfires meant that 30-60% of pre-European *E. regnans* forests would have been considered old growth (e.g. with living trees more than 120 years old).[28] In addition, studies of older *E. regnans* forests have shown that low-intensity fires lead to the development of younger cohorts of trees without killing the parent trees, which leads to the presence of multiple age classes in old-growth forests.[29]\n\n\nAs *E. regnans* forests mature, they start to develop characteristics that are representative of old-growth stands, such as large hollows, long strips of decorticating bark, an abundance of tree ferns and rainforest trees, buttressing at the base of *E. regnans* trunks, large clumps of mistletoe in the canopy, large fallen logs, and thick mats of moisture-retaining mosses.\n\n\n\n### Seed production, fire and regeneration[edit]\n\n\n*Eucalyptus regnans* lacks a lignotuber and hence cannot recover by reshooting after intense fire. Instead, it can only regenerate by seed, and is thus termed an obligate seeder.[30] The seeds are held firmly in woody capsules (gumnuts) until the branchlets die and the capsules dry out. Seedlings require a high level of light, much more than reaches the forest floor when there is a well-developed understorey, and so seeds are not likely to germinate or develop into saplings unless the understorey is opened up to allow light to reach the ground. As high-intensity fires tend to kill all parent trees, after fire there is a massive release of seed from drying capsules, which take advantage of the available light and the nutrients in the ash bed. Seedling densities of up to 2,500,000 per hectare (1,000,000/acre) have been recorded after a major fire. Through time there is a strong stand thinning effect and natural stem density reduction eventually leads to mature tree densities of about 30 to 40 per hectare (12 to 16/acre).\n\n\nThere is substantial variation in the age at which individual trees develop viable seeds, which is largely the result of growth rates, tree size, incident solar radiation, and topographic aspect.[26] Trees as young as 7 years old may contain mature fruit capsules, although this is unusual and most trees probably start producing seeds after 11 years of age.[26] Similarly, there is considerable variation in the rate at which stands of *E. regnans* develop seed crops.[26] Tree growth rates, stand age, and topography influence the rate of development of seed crops in stands, leading to strong variation in the timing of seed crop viability, however, the mean age of reproductive viability appears to be about 21 years.[26]\n\n\nAs *E. regnans* seeds are not stored in soil seedbanks, the regeneration of the forest depends on the presence of canopy-stored seed crops. With two or more frequent fires occurring in less than the time to stand reproductive viability, *E. regnans* can become locally extinct due to poor regeneration. As *E. regnans* is often the sole or dominant overstorey tree in many locations, this can lead to the replacement of a tall wet open forest ecosystem with a dense low wattle shrubland, which obviously has large repercussions for community composition and function. Conversely, in the complete absence of fire (for hundreds of years), the cool temperate rainforest species that live in association with *E. regnans* may gradually replace it in gullies or other areas where the trees succumb to age rather than fire.[31] Thus it is clear that *E. regnans* forests rely on a particular frequency and intensity of fires for maintenance of the ecosystem attributes. As contemporary fire regimes have been highly modified since European occupation of Australia, there is a clear risk to *E. regnans* forests in many regions.[32]\n\n\n\n### Ecological community[edit]\n\n\nThe majority of the endangered Leadbeater\u2019s possum population lives in mountain ash forests (*Eucalyptus regnans*, *E. delegatensis* and *E. nitens*) in the Central Highlands of Victoria. The possums use hollows in old trees for nesting and shelter and forage for arboreal arthropods under bark.[24] The vegetation structure of these forests enables the possums to travel through them.[24] Both Leadbeaters possums and yellow-bellied gliders feed on the sap from the trunks and branches.[33] Koalas feed on the foliage, though it is not one of their preferred forage species.[34]\n\n\nYellow-tailed black-cockatoos nest in the hollows of old trees,[35] in contrast to the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle (*Aquila audax fleayi*) that builds its nest of large sticks at the top of the trees.[36]\n\n\nIn a small area of rainforest in Yarra Ranges National Park in Victoria, nine epiphyte species were observed growing on *Eucalyptus regnans*, the most prevalent of these being the liverwort *Bazzania adnexa*.[37]\n\n\nThe spur-legged phasmid (*Didymuria violescens*) is a leaf-eating insect that can defoliate trees during major infestations such as one experienced at Powelltown in the early 1960s.[23] Leaves and buds are eaten by the larvae and adults of the chrysomelid leaf beetle *Chrysophtharta bimaculata*.[38] Stressed trees can be damaged by the eucalyptus longhorned borer (*Phoracantha semipunctata*), which burrows into the trunk, which exudes a red stain. Eucalypt weevils of the genus *Gonipterus* commonly damage *E. regnans*, while the tortoise beetle (*Paropsis atomaria*) is a common pest of plantations.[39]\n\n\n\n### Carbon storage[edit]\n\n\nA study carried out by environmental scientist Professor Brendan Mackey of the Australian National University in 2009 identified that mountain ash forests in Victoria\u2019s Central Highlands are the best in the world at locking up carbon.[40] Mackey and colleagues found the highest amount of carbon was contained in a forest located in the O'Shannassy River catchment, which held 1,867 tonnes per hectare (743.62\u00a0long ton/acre; 832.85\u00a0short ton/acre) of carbon. This area was a stand of unlogged mountain ash over 100 years old, which had had minimal human disturbance. They further calculated that a *E. regnans*-dominated forest with trees up to 250 years old and a well-established mid-storey and upper storey could store up to 2,844 tonnes per hectare (1,132.75\u00a0long ton/acre; 1,268.68\u00a0short ton/acre) of carbon.[41]\n\n\n\n### Tallest specimens[edit]\n\n\n![](image)El Grande in Tasmania's Styx Valley\n*Eucalyptus regnans* is the tallest of all flowering plants, and possibly the tallest of all plants, although no living specimens can make that claim. The tallest measured living specimen, named Centurion, stands 100.5 metres (330 feet)[42] tall in Tasmania.[43][44] Before the discovery of Centurion, the tallest known specimen was Icarus Dream, which was rediscovered in Tasmania in January, 2005 and is 97 metres (318\u00a0ft) high. It was first measured by surveyors at 98.8 metres (324\u00a0ft) in 1962 but the documentation had been lost.[45]\nA total of 16 living trees in Tasmania have been reliably measured in excess of 90 metres (300\u00a0ft).[46] The Cumberland Scenic Reserve near Cambarville, became the site of Victoria's tallest trees, in 1939, including one measured at 92 metres (302\u00a0ft) high, following the extensive Black Friday bushfires. A severe storm in 1959 blew down 13 of the trees and the tallest tree was reduced to a height of 84 metres (276\u00a0ft) after it lost part of its crown. The height of this tree was cited as 81.5 metres (267\u00a0ft) in 2002 following further storm damage in 1973.[23] In 2000, a tree at Wallaby Catchment in Kinglake National Park was discovered to be 91.6 metres (301\u00a0ft) tall in 2000,[23] however it perished in the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009.[47]\n\n\nHistorically, the tallest individual is claimed to be the Ferguson Tree, at 132.6 metres (435\u00a0ft), found in the Watts River region of Victoria in 1871 or 1872. This record is often disputed as unreliable, despite first-hand documentary evidence of it being measured on the ground with surveyor's tape by a senior forestry official (see below). Widespread agreement exists, however, that an exceptionally tall individual was reliably measured at 112.8 metres (370\u00a0ft) by theodolite in 1880 by a surveyor, George Cornthwaite, at Thorpdale, Victoria (the tree is known both as the Cornthwaite or Thorpdale Tree). When it was felled in 1881, Cornthwaite remeasured it on the ground by chain at 114.3 metres (375\u00a0ft).[48] The stump is commemorated with a plaque. That tree was about 1 metre (3.3\u00a0ft) shorter than *Hyperion*, the world's current tallest living tree, a coast redwood measuring 115.5 metres (379.1\u00a0ft).[49]\n\n\nSome individuals attain much greater diameter; the largest known being \"The Bulga Stump\", a charred remnant near Tarra Bulga, South Gippsland district, Victoria, Australia which as a living tree had a DBH of 10.77 metres (35\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in),[50][51] making *E. regnans* the third thickest species of tree after the Baobab (*Adansonia digitata*) and the Montezuma Cypress (*Taxodium mucronatum*). As a consequence of being both the tallest and thickest Australian trees, *E. regnans* is also the most massive; that title being currently held by an individual called the \"Kermandie Queen\" discovered 3.9 kilometres (2.4\u00a0mi) west of Geeveston, Tasmania which measures 76.99 metres (252\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) in height and has a diameter at breast height (DBH) of 6.88 metres (22\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in).[52]\n\n\nAl Carder notes that in 1888 a cash reward of 100 pounds was offered there for the discovery of any tree measuring more than 400 feet (120\u00a0m).[48] The fact that such a considerable reward was never claimed is taken as evidence that such large trees did not exist. Carder's historical research, however, revealed that the reward was offered under conditions that made it highly unlikely to be collected. First, it was made in the depths of winter and applied only for a very short time. Next, the tree had to be measured by an accredited surveyor. Since loggers had already taken the largest trees from the most accessible Victorian forests, finding very tall trees then would have demanded an arduous trek into remote wilderness and at considerable altitude. In turn, that meant that searchers also needed the services of experienced bushmen to be able to guide them and conduct an effective search. Only one expedition actually penetrated one of the strongholds of *E. regnans* at Mount Baw Baw but its search was rendered ineffectual by cold and snow and managed to measure only a single living tree\u00a0\u2013 the New Turkey Tree: 99.4 metres (326\u00a0ft)\u00a0\u2013 before appalling conditions forced a retreat, Carder notes.\n\n\nFerdinand von Mueller claimed to have personally measured one tree near the headwaters of the Yarra River at 122 metres (400\u00a0ft). Nurseryman David Boyle, claimed in 1862 to have measured a fallen tree in a deep gully in the Dandenongs at 119.5 metres (392\u00a0ft), and with a diameter at its broken tip that indicated it might have lost another eight metres (26\u00a0ft) of trunk when it broke, for 128 metres (420\u00a0ft).[48][53]\n\n\nVon Mueller's early records also mention two trees on the nearby Black Spur Range, one alive and measuring 128 metres (420\u00a0ft) and another fallen tree said to measure 146 metres (479\u00a0ft), but these were either based on hearsay or uncertain reliability. David Boyle also reported that a tree at Cape Otway measured 158 metres (518\u00a0ft), but this too was based on hearsay.\n\n\n\nNone, however, had been verified by direct documentation until 1982 when Ken Simpendorfer, a Special Projects Officer for the Forests Commission Victoria, directed a search of official Victorian archives. It unearthed a forgotten report from more than a century earlier, one that had not been referred to in other accounts of the species up to that time. It was written on 21 February 1872, by the Inspector of State Forests, William Ferguson, and was addressed to the Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Surveys, Clement Hodgkinson. Ferguson had been instructed to explore and inspect the watershed of the Watts River and reported trees in great number and exceptional size in areas where loggers had not yet reached. Ferguson wrote a letter to the editor in the Melbourne Age newspaper.[54]\n\n\n> *\"Some places, where the trees are fewer and at a lower altitude, the timber is much larger in diameter, averaging from 6 to 10 feet and frequently trees to 15 feet in diameter are met with on alluvial flats near the river. These trees average about ten per acre: their size, sometimes, is enormous. Many of the trees that have fallen by decay and by bush fires measure 350 feet in length, with girth in proportion. In one instance I measured with the tape line one huge specimen that lay prostrate across a tributary of the Watts and found it to be 435 feet from the roots to the top of its trunk. At 5 feet from the ground it measures 18 feet in diameter. At the extreme end where it has broken in its fall, it (the trunk) is 3 feet in diameter. This tree has been much burnt by fire, and I fully believe that before it fell it must have been more than 500 feet high. As it now lies it forms a complete bridge across a narrow ravine\" .... William Ferguson, The Melbourne Age, 22 February 1872.*[54]\n> \n> \n\nIt is also possible that individual trees will again attain such heights. Author Bob Beale has recorded that the tallest trees in the Black Spur Range now measure about 85 metres (279\u00a0ft) but\u00a0\u2013 due to major bushfires in the 1920s and 30s\u00a0\u2013 are less than 80 years old and have been growing consistently at the rate of about 1 metre (3.3\u00a0ft) a year.[55]\n\n\n### In New Zealand[edit]\n\n\nA *Eucalyptus regnans* stand in the Orokonui Ecosanctuary near Dunedin, New Zealand, where *E. regnans* is an introduced species, contains that country's tallest measured tree, standing 80.5 metres (264\u00a0ft) high in 2012.[56]\nA *Eucalyptus regnans* in the urban area of Greytown was measured at 32.8 metres (108\u00a0ft) in 2011.[57]\n\n\n\n## Uses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Eucalyptus regnans* logs at a woodmill\n![](image)\nTimber from Victorian mountain ash\n![](image)\nMountain ash flooring, showing gum vein, fiddleback figure, typical blonde colour\n\n*Eucalyptus regnans* is valued for its timber, and has been harvested in very large quantities. Aside from being logged in its natural range, it is grown in plantations in New Zealand and Chile, and to a limited extent, in South Africa and Zimbabwe.[39] Primary uses are sawlogging and woodchipping. It was a major source of newsprint in the 20th century. Much of the present woodchip harvest is exported to Japan. While the area of natural stands with large old trees is rapidly decreasing, substantial areas of regrowth exist and it is increasingly grown in plantations, the long, straight, fast growing trunks being much more commercially valuable than the old growth timber.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIt is a medium weight timber (about 680\u00a0kg/m3 or 1,150\u00a0lb/cu\u00a0yd) and rather coarse (stringy) in texture. Gum veins are common. The wood is easy to work and the grain is straight with long, clear sections without knots. The wood works reasonably well for steam-bending.\nPrimary uses for sawn wood are furniture, flooring (where its very pale blonde colour is highly prized), panelling, veneer, plywood, window frames, and general construction. The wood has sometimes been used for wood wool and cooperage. However, the wood needs steam reconditioning for high value applications, due to a tendency to collapse on drying. This wood is highly regarded by builders, furniture makers and architects.[14]\n\n\nGenetic comparison of logged stands and natural stands of mountain ash showed only minor differences in nuclear DNA between the two, with slightly stronger spatial genetic structure in the undisturbed treatment, higher levels of genetic differentiation in the logged treatment, and greater partitioning of genetic diversity among logged sites.[18] However, analysis of chloroplast DNA showed more substantial differences, with higher levels of diversity in logged sites than burnt or undisturbed sites suggesting that chloroplast DNA was entering the system via the use of non-local seed in the regeneration process.[18]\n\n\n\n## Conservation[edit]\n\n\n*E. regnans* forests are particularly susceptible to destruction by bushfire, and, to a lesser extent, timber harvesting.[58]\n\n\nOpposition to logging of wet forests by clearfelling has grown very strong in recent years (particularly opposition to woodchipping). It is a controversial debate with strong opinions both for and against timber harvesting.\n\n\nSeveral applications have been made to Victoria's Flora and Fauna Guarantee (FFG) Scientific Advisory Committee to list mountain ash forests as an endangered vegetation community. The committee rejected an application in 2017 as being ineligible and that it did not satisfy at least one criterion set out in the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and its Regulations of 2011. The assessment criteria included, was there a demonstrated state of decline, has there been a reduction in distribution or has vegetation community altered markedly.[59]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSherbrooke Forest, Victoria\n![](image)\n*Eucalyptus regnans*, Sherbrooke Forest\n\nStudies conducted by Murray Cunningham and David Ashton found that the re-growth habit of *Eucalyptus regnans* requires high light conditions, and the high nutrients contained in the ash layer. These conditions are found typically following a high intensity wildfire, which are an infrequent, yet periodic feature of mountain ash forests. For this reason clearfelling\u00a0\u2013 with the complete removal of all trees, followed by a high intensity fire and seeding\u00a0\u2013 is used by the timber industry and forest scientists to ensure regeneration of harvested areas because it mimics the conditions found after high intensity wildfire.[60][61]\n\n\nMelbourne's forested water catchment areas, which provides water requiring little treatment, are composed of large areas *E. regnans* forest. The management of 157,000 hectares of Melbourne\u2019s forested water catchments were vested in the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW) in 1891 with a closed catchment policy where timber harvesting and public access was not permitted. These areas are now included in the Yarra Ranges National Park. There has been a long running political campaign to add more areas to create the Great Forest National Park.[62]\n\n\nWater yields from catchments fall significantly for 20 to 40 years if trees are killed by bushfire or timber harvesting. The MMBW began research into forest cover on water supplies as early as 1948. In the early 1960s they set up a new series of paired catchment experiments in wet mountain forests near Healesville to measure the long term impacts of timber harvesting and bushfire on water quality and quantity. It took another 10 years for the results to emerge more clearly. It was found that while timber harvesting had an impact, the most dramatic threat to stream flows remained catastrophic bushfires like those on Black Friday in 1939 or Black Saturday in 2009.[63]\n\n\nIn 2018, some researchers concluded that Mountain Ash forests in Victoria represent collapsing ecosystems. They coined the term 'hidden collapse' meaning an ecosystem that gives a superficial appearance of being intact but has lost key elements. At their research sites they found that between 1997 and 2011, up to 50% of large old-cavity trees (trees with big holes that serve as nest sites for animals and birds) had been lost and there had also been a significant decline in the numbers of birds and tree dwelling marsupials such as possums and gliders. They identified fast and slow drivers of change: fire, logging, and climate change, and indicated that Mountain Ash forests would be replaced with Acacia-dominated woodlands.[64]\n\n\n\nLogging *Eucalyptus regnans* in Tasmania\n![](image)\nThe Styx River in Tasmania runs through a forest of *Eucalyptus regnans*, myrtle beech and tree ferns.

Seedlings are grown in containers but are more prone to damping off than other eucalypts; they are highly susceptible to *Phytophthora cinnamomi* and *P. nicotianae* Young plants are generally planted out once they are 8 or 9\u00a0months old. These are at risk of being eaten by grazing rabbits, wallabies and possums, which can destroy young plantations in severe cases.[39]\n\n\nAmerican horticulturist and entrepreneur Ellwood Cooper noted its rapid growth but demanding soil requirements in his 1876 work *Forest Culture and Eucalyptus Trees*.[67] *Eucalyptus regnans* requires fertile soil with good drainage and annual rainfall of 1,000 millimetres (39\u00a0in) spread over the year, and has poor tolerance to temperatures below \u22127\u00a0\u00b0C (19\u00a0\u00b0F) or drought.[39]\n\n\nOutside Australia, plantations have been successfully established in New Zealand, South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.[68]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* For other trees named *mountain ash*, see Mountain ash\n* The world\u00b4s tallest tree species\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Fensham, R.; Laffineur, B.; Collingwood, T.

Along with other species in the genus *Shorea*, it is also known as the *Yellow Meranti.* It is native to Borneo, the Malay Peninsula, and Thailand.[1] It is the tallest flowering plant, and third tallest living tree, after the sequoia and Himalayan cypress, with the largest specimen measuring 100.7\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) in height.[2]\n\n\n\n## Height[edit]\n\n\nThe tallest specimen, named \"Menara\", was measured in 2019.[3][4][5] The tree's height was measured from the top of the crown to the lowest part of the buttress,[2] giving an averaged measurement of 97.58 m.[6]\n\n\nAn almost equally tall *S. faguetiana*, 96.9\u00a0m (318\u00a0ft), was found in 2018 in the Tawau Hills National Park, Sabah, some 24\u00a0km (15\u00a0mi) from Tawau and about 9.5\u00a0km (5.9\u00a0mi) from the park\u2019s main station.[7][8]\n\n\nIn 2016, the then tallest tropical tree, known as \"Lahad Datu\", was found at the Danum Valley Conservation Area. It was measured as an average of tape drops to be 93.0\u00a0m (305.1\u00a0ft) tall and its canopy was 40.3\u00a0m (132\u00a0ft) in diameter.[9][10][11]\n\n\nAlso in 2016, a *Shorea faguetiana* tree 89.5\u00a0m (294\u00a0ft) tall was found in the Maliau Basin Conservation Area in Sabah.[12][13]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* The world's tallest tree species\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Pooma, R.; Newman, M.F.; Barstow, M.

Giant sequoia specimens are the most massive trees on Earth.[3] They occur naturally only in groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California.\n\n\nThe giant sequoia is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN, with fewer than 80,000 trees remaining. Since its last assessment as an endangered species in 2011, it was estimated that another 13\u201319% of the population (or 9,761\u201313,637 mature trees) were destroyed during the Castle Fire of 2020 and the KNP Complex & Windy Fire in 2021, events attributed to fire suppression and drought. Prescribed burns to reduce available fuel load may be crucial for saving the species.[4][5]\n\n\nThe Giant sequoia grow to an average height of 50\u201385 m (164\u2013279 ft) with trunk diameters ranging from 6\u20138 m (20\u201326 ft). Record trees have been measured at 94.8 m (311 ft) tall. The specimen known to have the greatest diameter at breast height is the General Grant tree at 8.8 m (28.9 ft). Giant sequoias are among the oldest living organisms on Earth. The oldest known giant sequoia is 3,200\u20133,266 years old. \n\n\nWood from mature giant sequoias is fibrous and brittle; trees would often shatter after they were felled. The wood was unsuitable for construction and instead used for fence posts or match sticks. The giant sequoia is a very popular ornamental tree in many parts of the world. The species is named in honor of the Cherokee Chief Sequoyah.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe etymology of the genus name has been presumed\u2014initially in *The Yosemite Book* by Josiah Whitney in 1868[6]\u2014to be in honor of Sequoyah (1767\u20131843), who was the inventor of the Cherokee syllabary.[7] An etymological study published in 2012 concluded that Austrian Stephen L. Endlicher is actually responsible for the name. A linguist and botanist, Endlicher corresponded with experts in the Cherokee language including Sequoyah, whom he admired. He also realized that coincidentally the genus could be described in Latin as *sequi* (meaning *to follow*) because the number of seeds per cone in the newly classified genus aligned in mathematical sequence with the other four genera in the suborder. Endlicher thus coined the name \"Sequoia\" as both a description of the tree's genus and an honor to the indigenous man he admired.[8]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Opened pollen cones\n![](image)Mature cones and seed\nGiant sequoia specimens are the most massive individual trees in the world.[3] They grow to an average height of 50\u201385\u00a0m (164\u2013279\u00a0ft) with trunk diameters ranging from 6\u20138\u00a0m (20\u201326\u00a0ft). Record trees have been measured at 94.8\u00a0m (311\u00a0ft) tall. Trunk diameters of 17\u00a0m (56\u00a0ft) have been claimed via research figures taken out of context.[9] The specimen known to have the greatest diameter at breast height is the General Grant tree at 8.8\u00a0m (28.9\u00a0ft).[10] Between 2014 and 2016, it is claimed that specimens of coast redwood were found to have greater trunk diameters than all known giant sequoias - though this has not been independently verified or affirmed in any academic literature.[11] The trunks of coast redwoods taper at lower heights than those of giant sequoias which have more columnar trunks that maintain larger diameters to greater heights.\n\n\n\n![](image)Leaves with closed pollen cones\nThe oldest known giant sequoia is 3,200\u20133,266 years old based on dendrochronology.[12][13] Giant sequoias are among the oldest living organisms on Earth, and are the verified third longest-lived tree species after the Great Basin bristlecone pine and alerce. Giant sequoia bark is fibrous, furrowed, and may be 90\u00a0cm (3\u00a0ft) thick at the base of the columnar trunk. The sap contains tannic acid, which provides significant protection from fire damage.[14] The leaves are evergreen, awl-shaped, 3\u20136\u00a0mm (1\u20448\u20131\u20444\u00a0in) long, and arranged spirally on the shoots.\n\n\nThe giant sequoia regenerates by seed. The seed cones are 4\u20137\u00a0cm (1+1\u20442\u20133\u00a0in) long and mature in 18\u201320 months, though they typically remain green and closed for as long as 20 years. Each cone has 30\u201350 spirally arranged scales, with several seeds on each scale, giving an average of 230 seeds per cone. Seeds are dark brown, 4\u20135\u00a0mm (0.16\u20130.20\u00a0in) long, and 1\u00a0mm (0.04\u00a0in) broad, with a 1-millimeter (0.04\u00a0in) wide, yellow-brown wing along each side. Some seeds shed when the cone scales shrink during hot weather in late summer, but most are liberated by insect damage or when the cone dries from the heat of fire. Young trees start to bear cones after 12 years.\n\n\nTrees may produce sprouts from their stumps subsequent to injury, until about 20 years old; however, shoots do not form on the stumps of mature trees as they do on coast redwoods. Giant sequoias of all ages may sprout from their boles when branches are lost to fire or breakage.\n\n\nA large tree may have as many as 11,000 cones. Cone production is greatest in the upper portion of the canopy. A mature giant sequoia disperses an estimated 300\u2013400 thousand seeds annually. The winged seeds may fly as far as 180\u00a0m (590\u00a0ft) from the parent tree.\n\n\nLower branches die readily from being shaded, but trees younger than 100 years retain most of their dead branches. Trunks of mature trees in groves are generally free of branches to a height of 20\u201350\u00a0m (70\u2013160\u00a0ft), but solitary trees retain lower branches.\n\n\n\n\n## Distribution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Generals Highway passes between giant sequoias in Sequoia National Park\nThe natural distribution of giant sequoias is restricted to a limited area of the western Sierra Nevada, California. As a paleoendemic species,[15] they occur in scattered groves, with a total of 81 groves (see list of sequoia groves for a full inventory), comprising a total area of only 144.16\u00a0km2 (35,620 acres). Nowhere does it grow in pure stands, although in a few small areas, stands do approach a pure condition. The northern two-thirds of its range, from the American River in Placer County southward to the Kings River, has only eight disjunct groves. The remaining southern groves are concentrated between the Kings River and the Deer Creek Grove in southern Tulare County. Groves range in size from 12.4\u00a0km2 (3,100 acres) with 20,000 mature trees, to small groves with only six living trees. Many are protected in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and Giant Sequoia National Monument.\n\n\nThe giant sequoia is usually found in a humid climate characterized by dry summers and snowy winters. Most giant sequoia groves are on granitic-based residual and alluvial soils. The elevation of the giant sequoia groves generally ranges from 1,400\u20132,000\u00a0m (4,600\u20136,600\u00a0ft) in the north, to 1,700\u20132,150 metres (5,580\u20137,050\u00a0ft) to the south. Giant sequoias generally occur on the south-facing sides of northern mountains, and on the northern faces of more southerly slopes.\n\n\nHigh levels of reproduction are not necessary to maintain the present population levels. Few groves, however, have sufficient young trees to maintain the present density of mature giant sequoias for the future. The majority of giant sequoia groves are currently undergoing a gradual decline in density since European settlement.\n\n\n\n### Pre-historic range[edit]\n\n\nWhile the present day distribution of this species is limited to a small area of California, it was once much more widely distributed in prehistoric times, and was a reasonably common species in North American and Eurasian coniferous forests until its range was greatly reduced by the last ice age. Older fossil specimens reliably identified as giant sequoia have been found in Cretaceous era sediments from a number of sites in North America and Europe, and even as far afield as New Zealand[16] and Australia.[17]\n\n\n\n### Artificial groves[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lake Fulmor, featuring a small grove of giant sequoia trees (top center)\nIn 1974, a group of giant sequoias was planted by the United States Forest Service in the San Jacinto Mountains of Southern California in the immediate aftermath of a wildfire that left the landscape barren. The giant sequoias were rediscovered in 2008 by botanist Rudolf Schmid and his daughter Mena Schmidt while hiking on Black Mountain Trail through Hall Canyon. Black Mountain Grove is home to over 150 giant sequoias, some of which stand over 6.1\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) tall. This grove is not to be confused with the Black Mountain Grove in the southern Sierra. Nearby Lake Fulmor Grove is home to seven giant sequoias, the largest of which is 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) tall. The two groves are located approximately 175\u00a0mi (282\u00a0km) southeast of the southernmost naturally occurring giant sequoia grove, Deer Creek Grove.[18][19]\n\n\nIt was later discovered that the United States Forest Service had planted giant sequoias across Southern California. However, the giant sequoias of Black Mountain Grove and nearby Lake Fulmor Grove are the only ones known to be reproducing and propagating free of human intervention. The conditions of the San Jacinto Mountains mimic those of the Sierra Nevada, allowing the trees to naturally propagate throughout the canyon.[20]\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Two giant sequoias, Sequoia National Park. The right-hand tree bears a large fire scar at its base; fires do not typically kill the trees but do remove competing thin-barked species, and aid giant sequoia regeneration.\nGiant sequoias are in many ways adapted to forest fires. Their bark is unusually fire resistant, and their cones will normally open immediately after a fire.[21] Giant sequoias are a pioneer species,[22] and are having difficulty reproducing in their original habitat (and very rarely reproduce in cultivation) due to the seeds only being able to grow successfully in full sun and in mineral-rich soils, free from competing vegetation. Although the seeds can germinate in moist needle humus in the spring, these seedlings will die as the duff dries in the summer. They therefore require periodic wildfire to clear competing vegetation and soil humus before successful regeneration can occur. Without fire, shade-loving species will crowd out young sequoia seedlings, and sequoia seeds will not germinate. When fully grown, these trees typically require large amounts of water and are therefore often concentrated near streams.[*citation needed*] Squirrels, chipmunks, finches and sparrows consume the freshly sprouted seedlings, preventing their growth.[23]\n\n\nFires also bring hot air high into the canopy via convection, which in turn dries and opens the cones. The subsequent release of large quantities of seeds coincides with the optimal postfire seedbed conditions. Loose ground ash may also act as a cover to protect the fallen seeds from ultraviolet radiation damage.\nDue to fire suppression efforts and livestock grazing during the early and mid-20th century, low-intensity fires no longer occurred naturally in many groves, and still do not occur in some groves today. The suppression of fires leads to ground fuel build-up and the dense growth of fire-sensitive white fir, which increases the risk of more intense fires that can use the firs as ladders to threaten mature giant sequoia crowns. Natural fires may also be important in keeping carpenter ants in check.[24]\nIn 1970, the National Park Service began controlled burns of its groves to correct these problems. Current policies also allow natural fires to burn. One of these untamed burns severely damaged the second-largest tree in the world, the Washington tree, in September 2003, 45 days after the fire started. This damage made it unable to withstand the snowstorm of January 2005, leading to the collapse of over half the trunk.\n\n\nIn addition to fire, two animal agents also assist giant sequoia seed release. The more significant of the two is a longhorn beetle (*Phymatodes nitidus*) that lays eggs on the cones, into which the larvae then bore holes. Reduction of the vascular water supply to the cone scales allows the cones to dry and open for the seeds to fall. Cones damaged by the beetles during the summer will slowly open over the next several months. Some research indicates many cones, particularly higher in the crowns, may need to be partially dried by beetle damage before fire can fully open them. The other agent is the Douglas squirrel (*Tamiasciurus douglasi*) that gnaws on the fleshy green scales of younger cones. The squirrels are active year-round, and some seeds are dislodged and dropped as the cone is eaten.[25]\n\n\n\n## Genome[edit]\n\n\nThe genome of the giant sequoia was published in 2020. The size of the giant sequoia genome is 8.125 Gb (8.125 billion base pairs) which were assembled into eleven chromosome-scale scaffolds, the largest to date of any organism.[26][27]\n\n\nThis is the first genome sequenced in the Cupressaceae family, and it provides insights into disease resistance and survival for this robust species on a genetic basis. The genome was found to contain over 900 complete or partial predicted NLR genes used by plants to prevent the spread of infection by microbial pathogens.\n\n\nThe genome sequence was extracted from a single fertilized seed harvested from a 1,360-year-old tree specimen in Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Park identified as SEGI 21. It was sequenced over a three-year period by researchers at University of California, Davis, Johns Hopkins University, University of Connecticut, and Northern Arizona University and was supported by grants from Save the Redwoods League and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture as part of a species conservation, restoration and management effort.[28]\n\n\n\n## Discovery and naming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shortly after their discovery by Europeans, giant sequoias were subject to much exhibition\nThe giant sequoia was well known to Native American tribes living in its area. Native American names for the species include *wawona*, *toos-pung-ish* and *hea-mi-withic*, the latter two in the language of the Tule River Tribe.\n\n\nThe first reference to the giant sequoia by Europeans is in 1833, in the diary of the explorer J. K. Leonard; the reference does not mention any locality, but his route would have taken him through the Calaveras Grove.[29] Leonard's observation was not publicized. The next European to see the species was John M. Wooster, who carved his initials in the bark of the 'Hercules' tree in the Calaveras Grove in 1850; again, this observation received no publicity. Much more publicity was given to the \"discovery\" by Augustus T. Dowd of the Calaveras Grove in 1852, and this is commonly cited as the species' discovery by non-natives.[29] The tree found by Dowd, christened the 'Discovery Tree', was felled in 1853.\n\n\nThe first scientific naming of the species was by John Lindley in December 1853, who named it *Wellingtonia gigantea*, without realizing this was an invalid name under the botanical code as the name *Wellingtonia* had already been used earlier for another unrelated plant (*Wellingtonia arnottiana* in the family Sabiaceae). The name \"Wellingtonia\" has persisted in England as a common name.[30] The following year, Joseph Decaisne transferred it to the same genus as the coast redwood, naming it *Sequoia gigantea*, but again this name was invalid, having been applied earlier (in 1847, by Endlicher) to the coast redwood. The name *Washingtonia californica* was also applied to it by Winslow in 1854, though this too is invalid, belonging to the palm genus *Washingtonia*.\n\n\n\n![](image)Clothespin tree in the Mariposa Grove, Yosemite National Park\nIn 1907, it was placed by Carl Ernst Otto Kuntze in the otherwise fossil genus *Steinhauera*, but doubt as to whether the giant sequoia is related to the fossil originally so named makes this name invalid.\n\n\nThe nomenclatural oversights were finally corrected in 1939 by John Theodore Buchholz, who also pointed out the giant sequoia is distinct from the coast redwood at the genus level and coined the name *Sequoiadendron giganteum* for it.\n\n\nThe etymology of the genus name has been presumed\u2014initially in *The Yosemite Book* by Josiah Whitney in 1868[6]\u2014to be in honor of Sequoyah (1767\u20131843), who was the inventor of the Cherokee syllabary.[7] An etymological study published in 2012, however, concluded that the name was more likely to have originated from the Latin *sequi* (meaning *to follow*) since the number of seeds per cone in the newly classified genus fell in mathematical sequence with the other four genera in the suborder.[8]\n\n\n\nJohn Muir wrote of the species in about 1870:\n\n\n> \n> \"Do behold the King in his glory, King Sequoia! Behold! Behold! seems all I can say. Some time ago I left all for Sequoia and have been and am at his feet, fasting and praying for light, for is he not the greatest light in the woods, in the world? Where are such columns of sunshine, tangible, accessible, terrestrialized?'[31]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Uses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Albert Bierstadt's \"Giant Redwood Trees of California\", 1874 \u2013 a large oil on canvas painting in the Berkshire Museum, Massachusetts, United States[32]\nWood from mature giant sequoias is highly resistant to decay, but due to being fibrous and brittle, it is generally unsuitable for construction. From the 1880s through the 1920s, logging took place in many groves in spite of marginal commercial returns. The Hume-Bennett Lumber Company was the last to harvest giant sequoia, going out of business in 1924.[33] Due to their weight and brittleness, trees would often shatter when they hit the ground, wasting much of the wood. Loggers attempted to cushion the impact by digging trenches and filling them with branches. Still, as little as 50% of the timber is estimated to have made it from groves to the mill. The wood was used mainly for shingles and fence posts, or even for matchsticks.\n\n\nPictures of the once majestic trees broken and abandoned in formerly pristine groves, and the thought of the giants put to such modest use, spurred the public outcry that caused most of the groves to be preserved as protected land. The public can visit an example of 1880s clear-cutting at Big Stump Grove near General Grant Grove. As late as the 1980s, some immature trees were logged in Sequoia National Forest, publicity of which helped lead to the creation of Giant Sequoia National Monument.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe wood from immature trees is less brittle, with recent tests on young plantation-grown trees showing it similar to coast redwood wood in quality. This is resulting in some interest in cultivating giant sequoia as a very high-yielding timber crop tree, both in California and also in parts of western Europe, where it may grow more efficiently than coast redwoods. In the northwest United States, some entrepreneurs have also begun growing giant sequoias for Christmas trees. Besides these attempts at tree farming, the principal economic uses for giant sequoia today are tourism and horticulture.\n\n\n\n## Threats[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Castle Fire wiped out a significant portion of the giant sequoia population.\nFormerly exploited by logging, sequoias are now threatened by both a combination of fire and fire suppression, along with drought. Fire suppression caused by European land management practices promotes the excessive growth of smaller trees such as fir, which can dry out in droughts, and serve as a fuel load for devastating crown fires fueled by strong winds, which can kill large amounts of sequoias. One such fire, the Castle Fire of 2020, is thought to have wiped out almost 10\u201314% of the species' whole population, or 7500\u201310,600 mature trees, including potentially the King Arthur Tree, the 10th tallest known individual. 3 to 5% more, or 2,261\u20133,637 sequoias, are thought to have died during the KNP Complex and Windy Fire in 2021, with a combined total of 13\u201319%. The most effective remedy for these impacts is heavy prescribed burning, which will need to be multiplied by 30 times current burning practices in order to ensure heathy sequoia groves.[4][34][5][35]\n\n\n\n## Cultivation[edit]\n\n\nGiant sequoia is a very popular ornamental tree in many areas. It is successfully grown in most of western and southern Europe, the Pacific Northwest of North America north to southwest British Columbia, the southern United States, southeast Australia, New Zealand and central-southern Chile. It is also grown, though less successfully, in parts of eastern North America.\n\n\nTrees can withstand temperatures of \u221231\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221225\u00a0\u00b0F) or colder for short periods of time, provided the ground around the roots is insulated with either heavy snow or mulch. Outside its natural range, the foliage can suffer from damaging windburn.\n\n\nA wide range of horticultural varieties have been selected, especially in Europe, including blue, compact blue, powder blue, hazel smith, pendulum\u2014or weeping\u2014varieties, and grafted cultivars.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sequoias in Eurodisney (near Paris) in 2009 and 2017\n### France[edit]\n\n\nThe tallest giant sequoia ever measured outside of the United States[37] is a specimen planted near Ribeauvill\u00e9 in France in 1856 and measured in 2014 at a height between 57.7\u00a0m (189\u00a0ft)[38] and 58.1\u00a0m (191\u00a0ft)[39] at age 158 years.\n\n\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The well-known giant sequoia avenue planted in 1863 at Benmore Botanic Garden, Scotland. These trees are all over 50 metres (160\u00a0ft) tall\nThe giant sequoia was first brought into cultivation in Britain in 1853 by the horticulturist Patrick Matthew of Perthshire from seeds sent by his botanist son John in California.[40] A much larger shipment of seed collected from the Calaveras Grove by William Lobb, acting for the Veitch Nursery near Exeter, arrived in England in December 1853;[41] seed from this batch was widely distributed throughout Europe.\n\n\nGrowth in Britain is very fast, with the tallest tree, at Benmore in southwest Scotland, reaching 56.4\u00a0m (185\u00a0ft) in 2014 at age 150 years,[42] and several others from 50\u201353\u00a0m (164\u2013174\u00a0ft) tall; the stoutest is around 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) in girth and 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) in diameter, in Perthshire. The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, and in their second campus at Wakehurst, contain multiple large specimens of the species. Biddulph Grange Garden in Staffordshire holds a fine collection of both *Sequoiadendron giganteum* and *Sequoia sempervirens* (coast redwood). The General Sherman of California has a volume of 1,489\u00a0m3 (52,600\u00a0cu\u00a0ft); by way of comparison, the largest giant sequoias in Great Britain have volumes no greater than 90\u2013100\u00a0m3 (3,200\u20133,500\u00a0cu\u00a0ft), one example being the 90\u00a0m3 (3,200\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) specimen in the New Forest.\n\n\n\n![](image)*Sequoiadendron giganteum* at New Forest, Hampshire, England, one of the tallest in the UK at 52.73\u00a0m (173.0\u00a0ft).[43]\n*Sequoiadendron giganteum* has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[44][45]\n\n\nAn avenue of 218 giant sequoias was planted in 1865 near the town of Camberley, Surrey, England. The trees have since been surrounded by modern real estate development.[46]\n\n\n\n### Italy[edit]\n\n\nNumerous giant sequoia were planted in Italy from 1860 through 1905. Several regions contain specimens that range from 40 to 48 metres (131 to 157\u00a0ft) in height. The largest tree is in Roccavione, in the Piedmont, with a basal circumference of 16 metres (52\u00a0ft). One notable tree survived a 200-metre (660\u00a0ft) tall flood wave in 1963 that was caused by a landslide at Vajont Dam. There are numerous giant sequoia in parks and reserves.[47]\n\n\nGrowth rates in some areas of Europe are remarkable. One young tree in Italy reached 22\u00a0m (72\u00a0ft) tall and 88\u00a0cm (2.89\u00a0ft) trunk diameter in 17 years (Mitchell, 1972).\n\n\n\n### Northern and Central Europe[edit]\n\n\nGrowth further northeast in Europe is limited by winter cold. In Denmark, where extreme winters can reach \u221232\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221226\u00a0\u00b0F), the largest tree was 35\u00a0m (115\u00a0ft) tall and 1.7\u00a0m (5.6\u00a0ft) diameter in 1976 and is bigger today. One in Poland has purportedly survived temperatures down to \u221237\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221235\u00a0\u00b0F) with heavy snow cover.\n\n\nTwo members of the German Dendrology Society, E. J. Martin and Illa Martin, introduced the giant sequoia into German forestry at the Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen in 1952.[48]\n\n\nTwenty-nine giant sequoias, measuring around 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) in height, grow in Belgrade's municipality of Lazarevac in Serbia.[49]\n\n\nThe oldest *Sequoiadendron* in the Czech Republic, at 44\u00a0m (144\u00a0ft), grows in Ratm\u011b\u0159ice u Votic castle garden.\n\n\n\n### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The giant sequoia tree in downtown Seattle, located adjacent to the historic The Bon March\u00e9 building, is unique for its urban setting.![](image)Unopened pollen (male) cones of cultivated tree in Portland, Oregon, US (fall)\n![](image)Immature seed (female) cones of cultivated tree in Portland, Oregon, US (fall)\nGiant sequoias are grown successfully in the Pacific Northwest and southern US, and less successfully in eastern North America. Giant sequoia cultivation is very successful in the Pacific Northwest from western Oregon north to southwest British Columbia, with fast growth rates. In Washington and Oregon, it is common to find giant sequoias that have been successfully planted in both urban and rural areas.\n\n\nIn Seattle, a 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) sequoia stands as a prominent landmark at the entrance to Seattle's downtown retail core.[50][51] Other large specimens exceeding 90\u00a0ft (27\u00a0m) are located on the University of Washington[52] and Seattle University[53] campuses, in the Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park cemetery,[54] and in the Leschi, Madrona, and Magnolia neighborhoods.[55]\n\n\nIn the northeastern US there has been some limited success in growing the species, but growth is much slower there, and it is prone to *Cercospora* and *Kabatina* fungal diseases due to the hot, humid summer climate there. A tree at Blithewold Gardens, in Bristol, Rhode Island, is reported to be 27 metres (89\u00a0ft) tall, reportedly the tallest in the New England states.[56][57] The tree at the Tyler Arboretum in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, at 29.1 metres (95\u00a0ft) may be the tallest in the northeast.[58] Specimens also grow in the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts (planted 1972, 18 m tall in 1998), at Longwood Gardens near Wilmington, Delaware, in the New Jersey State Botanical Garden at Skylands in Ringwood State Park, Ringwood, New Jersey, and in the Finger Lakes region of New York. Private plantings of giant sequoias around the Middle Atlantic States are not uncommon, and other publicly accessible specimens can be visited at the U.S. National Arboretum in Washington, D.C. A few trees have been established in Colorado as well.[59] Additionally, numerous sequoias have been planted with success in the state of Michigan.[60]\n\n\n\n![](image)*S. giganteum* \"Hazel Smith\", photographed at the U.S. National Arboretum in September, 2014.\nA cold-tolerant cultivar 'Hazel Smith' selected in about 1960 is proving more successful in the northeastern US. This clone was the sole survivor of several hundred seedlings grown at a nursery in New Jersey. The U.S. National Arboretum has a specimen grown from a cutting in 1970 that can be seen in the Gotelli Conifer Collection.\n\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\nThe Ballarat Botanical Gardens contain a significant collection, many of them about 150 years old. Jubilee Park and the Hepburn Mineral Springs Reserve in Daylesford, Cook Park in Orange, New South Wales and Carisbrook's Deep Creek park in Victoria both have specimens. Jamieson Township in the Victorian high country has two specimens which were planted in the early 1860s.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn Tasmania, specimens can be seen in private and public gardens, as sequoias were popular in the mid-Victorian era. The Westbury Village Green has mature specimens with more in Deloraine.[*citation needed*] The Tasmanian Arboretum contains both *Sequoiadendron giganteum* and *Sequoia sempervirens* specimens.[61]\n\n\nThe Pialligo Redwood Forest consists of 3,000 surviving redwood specimens, of 122,000 planted, 500 meters east of the Canberra Airport. The forest was laid out by the city's designer Walter Burley Griffin, though the city's arborist, Thomas Charles Weston, advised against it.[62][63] The National Arboretum Canberra began a grove of *Sequoiadendron giganteum* in 2008.[64] They also grow in the abandoned arboretum at Mount Banda Banda in New South Wales.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### New Zealand[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*S. giganteum* in Queenstown, New Zealand\nSeveral impressive specimens of Sequoiadendron giganteum can be found in the South Island of New Zealand. Notable examples include a set of trees in a public park of Picton, as well as robust specimens in the public and botanical parks of Christchurch and Queenstown. There are also several in private gardens in Wanaka. Other locations in Christchurch and nearby include a number of mature trees at the Riccarton Park Racecourse, three large trees on the roadside bordering private properties on Clyde Road, near Wai-Iti Terrace\u2014these are at least 150 years old. The suburb of \u2018Redwood\u2019 is named after a 160 years old Giant Redwood tree in the grounds of a local hotel. At St James Church, Harewood, is a protected very large specimen believed to be about 160 years old. A grove of about sixteen Redwood trees of varying ages is in Sheldon Park in the Belfast, New Zealand suburb. Some of these trees are in poor condition because of indifferent care. There is also a very large tree at Rangiora High School, which was planted for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee and is thus over 130 years old.[65]\n\n\n\n## Record trees[edit]\n\n\n### Largest by trunk volume[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of largest giant sequoias\n\nAs of 2009, the top ten largest giant sequoias sorted by volume of their trunks are:[9][note 1]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Tree Name\n | Grove\n | Height\n | Girth at ground\n | Volume\n | Estimated age |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | (ft)\n | (m)\n | (ft)\n | (m)\n | (ft3)\n | (m3)\n | (years)\n |\n| 1\n | General Sherman | Giant Forest | 275\n | 84\n | 103\n | 31\n | 52,508\n | 1,486.9\n | 2,300\u22122,700\n |\n| 2[note 2] | General Grant | General Grant Grove | 268\n | 82\n | 108\n | 33\n | 46,608\n | 1,319.8 [note 2] | 1,650\n |\n| 3[note 2] | President | Giant Forest | 241\n | 73\n | 93\n | 28\n | 45,148\n | 1,278.4 [note 2] | 3,200\n |\n| 4\n | Lincoln | Giant Forest | 256\n | 78\n | 98\n | 30\n | 44,471\n | 1,259.3\n |  |\n| 5\n | Stagg | Alder Creek Grove | 243\n | 74\n | 109\n | 33\n | 42,557\n | 1,205.1\n | 3,000\n |\n| 6\n | Boole | Converse Basin | 269\n | 82\n | 113\n | 34\n | 42,472\n | 1,202.7\n | 2,000 (minimum)\n |\n| 7\n | Genesis | Mountain Home Grove | 253\n | 77\n | 85\n | 26\n | 41,897\n | 1,186.4\n |  |\n| 8\n | Franklin | Giant Forest | 224\n | 68\n | 95\n | 29\n | 41,280\n | 1,168.9\n |  |\n| 9\n | King Arthur | Garfield Grove | 270\n | 82\n | 104\n | 32\n | 40,656\n | 1,151.2\n |  |\n| 10\n | Monroe | Giant Forest | 248\n | 76\n | 91\n | 28\n | 40,104\n | 1,135.6\n |  |\n\n\n![](image)General Sherman, largest known living single stem tree in the world\n* The General Sherman tree is estimated to weigh about 2100 tonnes.[68]\n* The Washington Tree was previously arguably the second largest tree with a volume of 47,850 cubic feet (1,355\u00a0m3) (although the upper half of its trunk was hollow, making the calculated volume debatable), but after losing the hollow upper half of its trunk in January 2005 following a fire, it is no longer of great size.\n* The largest giant sequoia ever recorded was the Father of the Forest from Calaveras Grove, an exceedingly massive tree which fell many centuries ago in the North Grove. Reportedly, the tree was once over 435ft tall, and 110ft in circumference, with a minimum height of 365 feet.[69][70] Now, what is left of the tree is a popular tourist attraction.\n\n\n### Tallest[edit]\n\n\n* Redwood \u2013 Redwood Mountain Grove \u2013 95 metres (311\u00a0ft)[9]\n* tallest outside the United States:[37] specimen near Ribeauvill\u00e9, France, measured in 2014 at a height between 58\u00a0m (190\u00a0ft)[38] and 58\u00a0m (190\u00a0ft)[39] at age 158 years.\n\n\n### Oldest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Muir Snag, believed to be over 3500 years old\nSee also: List of oldest trees\n\n* Muir Snag \u2013 Converse Basin Grove \u2013 more than 3500 years[9]\n\n\n### Greatest girth[edit]\n\n\n* Waterfall Tree \u2013 Alder Creek Grove \u2013 47 metres (155\u00a0ft) \u2013 tree with enormous basal buttress on very steep ground.[9]\n\n\n### Greatest base diameter[edit]\n\n\n* Waterfall Tree \u2013 Alder Creek Grove \u2013 21 metres (69\u00a0ft) \u2013 tree with enormous basal buttress on very steep ground.[9]\n* Tunnel Tree \u2013 Atwell Mill Grove \u2013 17 metres (57\u00a0ft) \u2013 tree with a huge flared base that has burned all the way through.[9]\n\n\n### Greatest mean diameter at breast height[edit]\n\n\n* General Grant \u2013 General Grant Grove \u2013 8.8 metres (29\u00a0ft)[9]\n\n\n### Largest limb[edit]\n\n\n* Arm Tree \u2013 Atwell Mill, East Fork Grove \u2013 4.0 metres (13\u00a0ft) in diameter[9]\n\n\n### Thickest bark[edit]\n\n\n* 0.9 metres (3\u00a0ft) or more[9]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Mother of the Forest\n* The House (trees)\n* Largest organisms\n* Kings Canyon National Park\n* Yosemite National Park\n* Calaveras Big Trees State Park\n* Old growth forest\n* List of superlative trees\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The volume figures have a low degree of accuracy (at best about \u00b114 cubic metres or 490 cubic feet), due to difficulties in measurement; stem diameter measurements are taken at a few set heights up the trunk, and assume that the trunk is circular in cross-section, and that taper between measurement points is even. The volume measurements also do not take cavities into account. The measurements are trunk-only, and do not include the volume of wood in the branches or roots.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \nThis table presents giant sequoias sorted by the volume of their trunks. In December 2012, Stephen Sillett announced a measurement of the President tree with a total of 54,000 cubic feet (1,500\u00a0m3) of wood and 9,000 cubic feet (250\u00a0m3) of wood in the branches.[66][67] Ranked according to the total amount of wood in the tree, the General Sherman tree is first, the President tree is second, and the General Grant tree is third.[66][67] General Sherman has 2,000 cubic feet (57\u00a0m3) more wood than the President tree.[66]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Schmid, R. & Farjon, A.
