All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.\n\n\nAnimated family films have performed consistently well at the box office, with Disney enjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home video era with Walt Disney Animation Studios, who have produced films such as *Aladdin* and *The Lion King*, both of which were the highest-grossing films of their respective years. Disney Animation also enjoyed later success with the *Frozen* films and *Zootopia* in addition to Pixar, of which the *Toy Story* films, the *Finding Nemo* films, the *Incredibles* films and *Inside Out* have been the best performers; beyond Disney and Pixar, the *Shrek*, *Ice Age*, *Madagascar* and *Despicable Me* series have met with the most success.\n\n\n\n> \n> An animated feature film is defined as a motion picture with a running time of more than 40 minutes, in which movement and characters' performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique. Motion capture by itself is not an animation technique. In addition, a significant number of the major characters must be animated, and animation must figure in no less than 75 per cent of the picture's running time.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Rule Seven \u2013 Special Rules for the Animated Feature Film Award: I. Definition[1]\n\n\n## Highest-grossing animated films[edit]\n\n\nThe chart below lists the highest-grossing animated films. Figures are given in United States dollars (USD). Many films that were released during the 20th century do not appear on this list as figures have not been adjusted for inflation, and as a result the films on this list have all had a theatrical run (including re-releases) since 2004. Films that have not played since then do not appear on the chart due to ticket price inflation, population size, and ticket purchasing trends not being considered. If inflation were adjusted for, *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* would appear at the top of the chart with an adjusted gross of $1,977,000,000.[2][nb 1] All except two\u2014*The Simpsons Movie* and the original 1994 version of *The Lion King*\u2014are computer-animated films. *Despicable Me* is the most represented franchise with all five films in the top 50 highest-grossing animated films. The top 11 films on this list, each having grossed in excess of $1 billion worldwide, are also ranked between 9th and 49th among the top 50 highest-grossing films of all time.\n\n\n\n\u2020\u00a0*Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 7 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\nHighest-grossing animated films[4]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *The Lion King* (2019)[nb 2] | $1,663,075,401\n | 2019\n | [# 1][7][8] |\n| 2\n | *Frozen II* | $1,453,683,476\n | 2019\n | [# 2][# 3] |\n| 3\n | *The Super Mario Bros.

The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, with 2016 the most recent year available.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Disney, which produced *The Lion King* (2019), considered the film to be live-action despite most of the film (aside from its opening shot) being made with photorealistic computer animation.[5] Others, such as the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (presenter of the Golden Globe Awards), deemed it to be animated based on specified criteria.[6]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** *Box Office Mojo* stopped updating its main total for *Frozen* in August 2014, while it was still in release. The total listed here incorporates subsequent earnings in Japan, Nigeria, Spain, the United Kingdom and Germany up to the end of 2015, but omits earnings in Turkey, Iceland, Brazil, and Australia (2016) which amount to a few hundred thousand dollars. The total is rounded to $1\u00a0million to compensate for the numerical inaccuracy.\n4. **^** *Snow White* earned $8.5\u00a0million in gross rental upon its initial release, in the process becoming the highest-grossing sound film. The gross rental is the distributor's share of the box-office gross and was more commonly reported than the exhibition gross up to the 1970s.\n5. **^** It is possible *Aladdin* never took the record. *Aladdin*'s release (1992\u201393) coincided with a *Snow White* reissue, and it is possible that *Snow White* ended up grossing more. *Snow White* had grossed a total of $330 million up to 1987, and then added a further $88 million in North America from its 1987 and 1993 reissues; it is unknown how much *Snow White* made from these reissues outside of North America, but if the foreign gross matched or exceeded the North American gross then *Snow White* would have earned more.\n\n1. **^** *Ne Zha* Gross\n\n\t* China \u2013 $723,650,000[11]\n\t* United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Vietnam \u2013 $6,307,704[12]\n2. **^** *Ne Zha* Gross\n\n\t* China \u2013 $723,650,000[11]\n\t* United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Vietnam \u2013 $6,307,704[12]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"88th Academy Awards of Merit\" (PDF). *Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences*.

However, it does state that it is one of only two pre-1955 films\u2014the other being *Gone with the Wind*\u2014that are among the adjusted top ten. It placed tenth in the 2012 edition, and the eleventh highest-grossing film according to the 2015 edition is *The Exorcist*, which has grossed $1.794\u00a0billion adjusted to 2014 prices. The adjusted grosses for the other films on the chart increased by 4.2 percent between 2011 and 2014 according to Guinness, and using this apparent rate of inflation would take the adjusted gross for *Snow White* from $1.746\u00a0billion at 2011 prices to $1.819\u00a0billion at 2014 prices.\n3. **^** International Monetary Fund. \"Inflation, consumer prices (annual\u00a0%)\".

Disney also enjoyed later success with films such as *Frozen* and *Frozen II*, *Zootopia*, and *The Lion King* (with its computer-animated remake as the highest-grossing animated film), as well as its Pixar brand, of which *Incredibles 2*, *Toy Story 3* and *4*, and *Finding Dory* have been the best performers.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Phase Three | $13,505,059,275\n | 11\n | $1,227,732,661\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* (2019) | $2,797,501,328 |\n| 2\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) | $2,048,359,754 |\n| 3\n | *Black Panther* (2018) | $1,347,280,838 |\n| 4\n | *Captain America: Civil War* (2016) | $1,153,337,496 |\n| 5\n | *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019) | $1,131,927,996 |\n| 6\n | *Captain Marvel* (2019) | $1,128,274,794 |\n| 7\n | *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017) | $880,166,924 |\n| 8\n | *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017) | $863,756,051 |\n| 9\n | *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017) | $853,983,879 |\n| 10\n | *Doctor Strange* (2016) | $677,796,076 |\n| 11\n | *Ant-Man and the Wasp* (2018) | $622,674,139\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n92. **^** \"*Titanic* sinks competitors without a trace\". *BBC News*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Phase Two | $5,269,487,547\n | 6\n | $878,247,925\n | *Avengers: Age of Ultron* ($1,402,809,540)\n |\n| 1\n | *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015) | $1,402,809,540 |\n| 2\n | *Iron Man 3* (2013) | $1,214,811,252 |\n| 3\n | *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014) | $773,350,147 |\n| 4\n | *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014) | $714,421,503 |\n| 5\n | *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) | $644,783,140 |\n| 6\n | *Ant-Man* (2015) | $519,311,965\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Phase One | $3,813,212,481\n | 6\n | $635,535,414\n | *The Avengers* ($1,518,815,515)\n |\n| 1\n | *The Avengers* (2012) | $1,518,815,515 |\n| 2\n | *Iron Man 2* (2010) | $623,933,331 |\n| 3\n | *Iron Man* (2008) | $585,796,247 |\n| 4\n | *Thor* (2011) | $449,326,618 |\n| 5\n | *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011) | $370,569,774 |\n| 6\n | *The Incredible Hulk* (2008) | $264,770,996\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1993 Re-issue)\". *Boxoffice*.

Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. *Titanic* earned $1.2\u00a0billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2\u00a0billion it grossed in theatres. While complete sales data are not available for *Avatar*, it earned $345\u00a0million from the sale of sixteen\u00a0million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty\u00a0million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3\u00a0billion each. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | The Fast Saga | $6,572,768,534\n | 10\n | $657,276,853\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| 1\n | *Furious 7* (2015) | $1,515,341,399 |\n| 2\n | *The Fate of the Furious* (2017)*F8* | $1,238,764,765 |\n| 3\n | *Fast & Furious 6* (2013) | $788,680,968 |\n| 4\n | *F9* (2021) | $726,229,501 |\n| 5\n | *Fast X* (2023) | $714,414,576 |\n| 6\n | *Fast Five* (2011) | $626,137,675 |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* (2009) | $360,366,870 |\n| 8\n | *2 Fast 2 Furious* (2003) | $236,350,661 |\n| 9\n | *The Fast and the Furious* (2001) | $207,517,509 |\n| 10\n | *Tokyo Drift* (2006) | $158,964,610\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Hobbs & Shaw* (2019) | $760,732,926\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 8\n | *Batman* | $6,843,842,452\n | 17\n | $402,578,968\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* ($1,081,169,825)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50\u00a0million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5\u00a0million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** Tartaglione, Nancy (March 13, 2021). \"'Avatar' Overtakes 'Avengers: Endgame' As All-Time Highest-Grossing Film At Global Box Office; China Reissue Growing\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

Other sources put its earnings at $2\u00a0million,[55] which may suggest the higher figure is the worldwide rental, given the confusion over international figures during this period.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *The Red Shoes* | $5,000,000\\*R | \u00a3505,581 (~$2,000,000)\n | [# 154][# 168][# 169] |\n| *The Snake Pit* | $4,100,000\\*R | $3,800,000 | [# 170][# 171] |\n| 1949 | *Samson and Delilah* | $14,209,250R | $3,097,563 | [# 172][# 97] |\n| 1950 | *Cinderella* | $263,591,415($20,000,000/$7,800,000R)\n | $2,200,000 | [# 173][# 174][# 175] |\n| *King Solomon's Mines* | $10,050,000R | $2,258,000 | [# 176] |\n| 1951 | *Quo Vadis* | $21,037,000\u201326,700,000R | $7,623,000 | [# 172][# 177][# 178] |\n| 1952 | *This Is Cinerama* | $50,000,000CI | $1,000,000 | [# 179][# 180] |\n| *The Greatest Show on Earth* | $18,350,000R GS | $3,873,946 | [# 181][# 182][# 97] |\n| 1953 | *Peter Pan* | $145,000,000 ($7,000,000)\\*R | $3,000,000\u20134,000,000 | [# 183][# 184] |\n| *The Robe* | $25,000,000\u201326,100,000R | $4,100,000 | [# 185][# 186][# 178] |\n| 1954 | *Rear Window* | $24,500,000\\* ($5,300,000)\\*R | $1,000,000 | [# 187][# 177] |\n| *White Christmas* | $26,000,050\\* ($12,000,000)\\*R | $3,800,000 | [# 188][# 189][# 190] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Main series | $3,059,525,837\n | 7\n | $437,075,120\n | *Days of Future Past* ($746,045,700)\n |\n| 1\n | *Days of Future Past* (2014) | $746,045,700 |\n| 2\n | *Apocalypse* (2016) | $543,934,105 |\n| 3\n | *The Last Stand* (2006) | $460,435,291 |\n| 4\n | *X2* (2003) | $407,711,549 |\n| 5\n | *First Class* (2011) | $352,616,690 |\n| 6\n | *X-Men* (2000) | $296,339,528 |\n| 7\n | *Dark Phoenix* (2019) | $252,442,974\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Deadpool *series** | $1,568,508,764\n | 2\n | $784,254,382\n | *Deadpool 2* ($785,896,609)\n |\n| 1\n | *Deadpool 2* (2018) | $785,896,609 |\n| 2\n | *Deadpool* (2016) | $782,612,155\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Wolverine *series** | $1,406,912,546\n | 3\n | $468,970,849\n | *Logan* ($619,021,436)\n |\n| 1\n | *Logan* (2017) | $619,021,436 |\n| 2\n | *The Wolverine* (2013) | $414,828,246 |\n| 3\n | *Origins: Wolverine* (2009) | $373,062,864\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Frozen (2013) \u2013 International Box Office Results\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Hughes did not have the \"Midas touch\" the trade press so often attributed to him. *Variety*, for example, reported that *Hell's Angels* cost $3.2\u00a0million to make, and by July, 1931, eight months after its release, the production cost had nearly been paid off. Keats claimed the picture cost $4\u00a0million to make and that it earned twice that much within twenty years. The production cost estimate is probably correct. Hughes worked on the picture for over two years, shooting it first as a silent and then as a talkie. Lewis Milestone said that in between Hughes experimented with shooting it in color as well. But *Variety*'s earnings report must be the fabrication of a delirious publicity agent, and Keats' the working of a myth maker. During the seven years it was in United Artists distribution, *Hell's Angels* grossed $1.6\u00a0million in the domestic market, of which Hughes' share was $1.2\u00a0million. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n92. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Solomon, Aubrey (2011). *The Fox Film Corporation, 1915\u20131935: A History and Filmography*.
