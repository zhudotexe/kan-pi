Brown Jr.** (born December 12, 1981) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). After graduating from Cartersville High School in Georgia, Brown attended Auburn University to play college football for the Auburn Tigers. He and Cadillac Williams shared carries at running back, while he had 1,008 yards and 13 touchdowns in 2002, 446 yards and five touchdowns in 2003, and 913 yards and eight touchdowns in 2004. Brown finished seventh in school history with 2,707 rushing\u00a0yards and fifth with 28 rushing touchdowns. He twice earned second-team All-Southeastern Conference honors in 2002 and 2004.\n\n\nBrown was drafted second overall by the Miami Dolphins in the 2005 NFL Draft. Brown started at running back for the Dolphins for the first four weeks of the season while Ricky Williams served a suspension, and shared carries with him when he returned in week five. Brown became the feature back in 2006 due to Williams' full year suspension. Brown sat out three games due to a broken hand suffered on Thanksgiving Day in a game against the Detroit Lions, returning in week 16. He played in the first seven games of the 2007 season before suffering a knee injury which knocked him out for the remainder of the season. Williams started over Brown in the first two games of the 2008 season, but shared carries with him after week two. Brown had 916\u00a0yards and ten touchdowns in 2008, which led to his first Pro Bowl selection following the season. He was placed on injured reserve for the second straight season after suffering a foot injury in week nine of the 2009 season. Brown rushed for 734\u00a0yards and five touchdowns in 2010, as he started in all 16 games. He played for the Philadelphia Eagles in 2011 following a six-year career with the Dolphins.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\nBrown attended Cartersville High School in Georgia, where he was a three-year starter and rushed for 4,936 yards, 12 touchdowns.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brown on the sideline at the 2004 AU\u2013UGA game.\nBrown moved on to Auburn University, where he majored in communications and played for coach Tommy Tuberville's Auburn Tigers football team from 2000 to 2004. He teamed up with speed running back Carnell Williams to create a premier running threat of speed and power. He redshirted after playing in the first two games of the 2000 season as he only gained 10 yards on six carries. In 2001, he played in 10 games and ranked third on the team with 330 yards on 84 carries and two touchdowns while catching seven passes for 109 yards.\n\n\nBrown enjoyed his best season in 2002 when he gained a career-high 1,008 yards on 175 carries (5.8 avg.) with 13 touchdowns while subbing for the injured Williams. He also had nine receptions for 166 yards (18.4 avg.) and a touchdown. However, in 2003, with Williams healthy and starting, Brown's statistics dropped as he carried the ball only 95 times for 446 yards (4.7 avg.), recorded five touchdowns, and had eight receptions for 80 yards.\n\n\nIn 2004, Brown shared duties with Williams and started seven games. Together with Jason Campbell, coach Tommy Tuberville called them the best backfield in the past 30 years as they led the team to a 13-0 record. He totaled 913 yards on 153 carries and scored eight times. He also displayed his receiving capabilities as he ranked second on the team with 34 catches for 313 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\nAlthough he started only 21 of 47 games for Auburn he finished his career ranked seventh in school history with 2,707 yards rushing on 513 carries while ranking fifth with 28 rushing touchdowns. Brown also had 58 receptions for 668 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\nIn 2020, Brown was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.[1]\n\n\n\n### Stats[edit]\n\n\n* 2000: 6 carries for 10 yards and no touchdowns.\n* 2001: 84 carries for 330 yards (3.93) and 2 touchdowns. 7 catches for 109 yards.\n* 2002: 175 carries for 1008 yards (5.76) and 13 touchdowns. 9 catches for 166 yards and 1 touchdown.\n* 2003: 95 carries for 446 yards (4.69) and 5 touchdowns. 8 catches for 80 yards.\n* 2004: 153 carries for 913 yards (5.97) and 8 touchdowns. 34 catches for 313 yards and 1 touchdown.\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPre-draft measurables\n| Height | Weight | Arm length | Hand span | 40-yard dash | 10-yard split | 20-yard split | 20-yard shuttle | Three-cone drill | Vertical jump | Broad jump | Bench press |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\u00a0ft 0+1\u20444\u00a0in(1.84\u00a0m)\n | 233\u00a0lb(106\u00a0kg)\n | 31+5\u20448\u00a0in(0.80\u00a0m)\n | 9+5\u20448\u00a0in(0.24\u00a0m) | 4.48 s | 1.56 s | 2.60 s | 4.08 s | 7.10 s | 34.0\u00a0in(0.86\u00a0m) | 9\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in(2.97\u00a0m) | 18 reps |\n| All values from NFL Combine[2][3] |\n\n\n### Miami Dolphins[edit]\n\n\nBrown entered the 2005 NFL Draft and was drafted with the second overall pick of the first round by the Miami Dolphins.[4] Fellow Auburn University halfback Carnell Williams was also in the draft and was selected with the fifth pick in the first round by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brown held out of training camp due to a contract dispute and as a result was not successful running the ball in the first two weeks of the season as he rushed for only 93 yards on 34 carries (2.7 avg.) and no touchdowns. However, he got on track in Week 3 as he rushed for 132 yards on 23 carries (5.7 avg.) and his first career touchdown. He followed this up with a successful Week 4 performance rushing for 97 yards on 17 carries (5.7 avg.). But during Week 5, he had to again share rushing duties with another premier running back, this time Ricky Williams who was returning from a four-game suspension. Brown ended up having only about forty more rushes than Williams during the 2005 season, and was well on pace for a 1,000 yard campaign if it wasn't for them sharing the football. Brown ended up with 207 rushes for 907 yards (4.4 avg.) and 4 touchdowns while having 32 receptions for 232 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\nWith Ricky Williams suspended for the entire season, Brown entered 2006 as the feature back for the Miami Dolphins. The offensive line and offense in general struggled for the Dolphins, making it difficult for Brown to consistently produce at a high level. He had a breakout game on October 15 loss to the New York Jets, rushing for 127 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. Three weeks later he rushed for a career-high 157 yards against a stingy Chicago Bears defense, helping the Dolphins to an upset victory of the previously undefeated Bears. On a Thanksgiving Day game against the Detroit Lions, Brown suffered a broken left hand from a hit by a defender's helmet. While he missed the next three contests, Brown returned for the final two games of the season and posted back-to-back 100-yard rushing performances against the Indianapolis Colts and New York Jets. In 13 games played, Brown finished with 1,008 rushing yards, 276 receiving yards, five touchdowns and a solid 4.2 average.\n\n\nDuring the team's minicamp in May 2007, Brown revealed that he was eight pounds over his listed playing weight of 232, and would like to cut his body fat from 12 percent to 8 or 9 percent. During week 7, Ronnie Brown injured his knee making a tackle during an interception return and was lost for the season. At the time of his injury he was leading the league in yards from scrimmage and was on pace for over 2,200 total yards on the season.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brown maneuvers past 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis at the 2009 Pro Bowl.\nBefore the 2008 regular season started, Tony Sparano, announced Ricky Williams would be the starting running back. During the first two games Brown carried the ball 17 times for a total of 48 yards and one touchdown. Before the New England Patriots game Ronnie Brown was made the starting running back and has been featured in the Dolphins' popular Wildcat formation, which borrows from former Auburn University OC Gus Malzahn's college spread offense.[5] Brown rushed for 117 yards, including four rushing scores, while the running back also threw a touchdown pass. Although he split carries with teammate Ricky Williams, Brown still had a solid 2008 season rushing for 916 yards on 214 carries, an average of 4.3 ypc.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brown with the Dolphins in 2009.\nBrown was also selected to the 2009 Pro Bowl as a reserve running back.\n\n\nFor the 2009 NFL season, Brown played and started in nine of the sixteen games of the regular season. During these nine games Brown managed to carry the ball 148 times for a total of 648 yards averaging 4.4 yards per carry. Brown also managed to rush for eight touchdowns. Brown in addition to rushing the ball managed to complete 14 passes for a total of 98 yards. During the 11th week of the regular season; Brown suffered a right foot injury against Tampa Bay and was placed on injured reserve. Brown's injury caused him to miss the remainder of the season.\n\n\nIn 2010, Brown became a restricted free agent, but re-signed with the Dolphins.\n\n\nOn March 19, 2010, Brown was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol outside Atlanta.[6]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia Eagles[edit]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2011, Brown signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles worth $1 million. It was reported that there were incentives in the contract that could take the value over $1 million.[7]\n\n\nThe Eagles traded Brown to the Detroit Lions in exchange for running back Jerome Harrison and a seventh-round draft pick in 2013 on October 18, 2011,[8] but the trade was voided the next day after Harrison failed his physical with the Eagles.\n\n\n\n### San Diego Chargers[edit]\n\n\nBrown signed a one-year contract with the San Diego Chargers on June 8, 2012.[9]\nAfter an injury to starting running back Ryan Mathews in the preseason, Brown started the season opener against the Oakland Raiders on Monday Night Football. While he was ineffective on the ground, gaining just 5 yards on five carries, Brown became the third-down back for the Chargers. On January 5, 2014, Brown sealed a 27\u201310 win for the Chargers with a 58-yard touchdown run in the wild card playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\n\n\n### Houston Texans[edit]\n\n\nThe Houston Texans signed Brown on August 11, 2014.[10] He was released on October 1, 2014.[11]\n\n\n\n### San Diego Chargers (second stint)[edit]\n\n\nOn October 7, 2014, Brown was signed by the San Diego Chargers, following a concussion suffered by Chargers' running back Donald Brown on October 5. The team had already lost running back Danny Woodhead for the season[12] due to an ankle injury suffered on September 21, 2014, in a game against the Buffalo Bills.[13] The team was also without running back Ryan Mathews who suffered an MCL sprain on September 21 in a game against the Seattle Seahawks and was expected to be out 4\u20135 weeks.[14] Ronnie Brown played in seven games for the Chargers in the 2014 season. On December 20, 2014 (Week 16), in a game at San Francisco, he played an important role in a 38\u201335 overtime victory instrumental in keeping San Diego's playoff hopes alive. In overtime, Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers handed off the ball to Brown on six straight plays, as the team moved 22 yards to set up Nick Novak's game-winning fieldgoal.[15] The next week, in the regular-season finale, he didn't record a single carry, as the Chargers lost to the Kansas City Chiefs and didn't make the playoffs. At the end of the season, the San Diego Chargers organization didn't offer him a contract extension.\n\n\n\n## NFL career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| General\n | Rushing\n | Receiving\n | Fum |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Season\n | Team\n | GP | GS | Att | Yards | Y/A | Y/G | TDs | Tgt | Rec | Yards | Y/R | Y/G | TDs |\n| 2005 | MIA | 15 | 14 | 207 | 907 | 4.4 | 60.5 | 4 | 47 | 32 | 232 | 7.3 | 15.5 | **1** | **4** |\n| 2006 | MIA | 13 | 12 | **241** | **1,008** | 4.2 | 77.5 | 5 | 38 | 33 | 276 | 8.4 | 21.2 | 0 | **4** |\n| 2007 | MIA | 7 | 7 | 119 | 602 | **5.1** | **86.0** | **4** | 46 | 39 | **389** | **10.0** | **55.6** | **1** | 0\n |\n| 2008 | MIA | **16** | 13 | 214 | 916 | 4.3 | 57.3 | **10** | 43 | 33 | 254 | 7.7 | 15.9 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2009 | MIA | 9 | 9 | 147 | 648 | 4.4 | 72.0 | 8 | 20 | 14 | 98 | 7.0 | 10.9 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2010 | MIA | **16** | **16** | 200 | 734 | 3.7 | 45.9 | 5 | 43 | 33 | 242 | 7.3 | 15.1 | 0 | 3\n |\n| 2011 | PHI | **16** | 2 | 42 | 136 | 3.2 | 8.5 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | \u2014 | 0.0 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2012 | SD | 14 | 1 | 46 | 220 | 4.8 | 15.7 | 0 | **59** | **49** | 371 | 7.6 | 26.5 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2013 | SD | **16** | 0 | 45 | 157 | 3.5 | 9.8 | 1 | 8 | 8 | 60 | 7.5 | 3.8 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2014 | HOU | 3 | 0 | 6 | 4 | 0.7 | 1.3 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 5 | 5.0 | 1.7 | 0 | 0\n |\n| SD | 7 | 0 | 14 | 59 | 4.2 | 8.4 | 0 | 7 | 4 | 39 | 9.8 | 5.6 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Career[16] | 132 | 74 | 1,281 | 5,391 | 4.2 | 40.8 | 38 | 314 | 246 | 1,966 | 8.0 | 14.9 | 2 | 14\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Ronnie Brown\".

He played college football for the Texas Longhorns where he won the 2005 Rose Bowl, was recognized as a consensus All-American and was the Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year in 2001. He was selected by Chicago with the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft and also played for the Cincinnati Bengals and Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBenson began to emerge as a football stand-out in the eighth grade while attending Abell Junior High School in Midland, Texas, under Coach Chris McKinney. Benson attended Robert E. Lee High School in Midland, Texas, and finished his high school playing career with 8,423 rushing yards (the most in Texas 5A history, largest classification at the time, and the fourth most in Texas high school football history).[1] He led his team to three consecutive State Championships, and rushed for a total of 15 touchdowns in the three championship games. Benson rushed for more than 1,900 yards in only 9 games. He rushed for over 3,500 yards (51 touchdowns) his junior year in an undefeated State and National Championship season. He was the first high school player ever to make the cover of Dave Campbell's Texas Football annual magazine. Benson was also a center fielder on the baseball team. As a senior, in District 4-5A games, he hit .361 with 4 home runs and 14 RBIs.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nBenson attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a four-year starter for the Longhorns football team. As a senior in 2004, he received the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top running back and was recognized as a consensus All-American. He finished his college career with 5,540 rushing yards to rank tenth all time in NCAA Division I-A history, and second only to Ricky Williams in Longhorns team history.\n\n\nHe has often been compared to Williams, due to their similarities in running style, college choice, legal complications,[2][3] and superficial appearance (roughly the same size and build coming out of college, and both had dreadlocks early in their careers), and the fact that they had both been minor league baseball players.\n\n\nWhile attending the University of Texas, Benson majored in social work and sociology. During his latter years, he earned membership into the Texas' Athletics Director's Academic Honor Roll, and the Big 12 Commissioner's Honor Roll in fall of 2003. Also, while in college, Benson was arrested twice, once for possession of marijuana and the other for criminal trespass. The marijuana case was dropped after a friend came forward and claimed ownership. He received 8 days in jail for the trespass conviction although he spent no time in jail other than the day of arrest due to overcrowding in Travis County Jail. He was forced to serve a one-half game suspension against Baylor University.[4]\n\n\n\n### College statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Team\n | GP\n | Rushing\n | Receiving\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Att | Yds | Avg | TD | Rec | Yds | TD\n |\n| 2001 | Texas | 12 | 223 | 1,053 | 4.7 | 12 | 17 | 203 | 1\n |\n| 2002 | Texas | 13 | 305 | 1,293 | 4.2 | 12 | 21 | 119 | 0\n |\n| 2003 | Texas | 12 | 258 | 1,360 | 5.3 | 21 | 9 | 120 | 1\n |\n| 2004 | Texas | 12 | 326 | 1,834 | 5.6 | 19 | 22 | 179 | 1\n |\n| Totals[5] | 49 | 1,112 | 5,540 | 5.0 | 64 | 69 | 621 | 3\n |\n\n\n## Professional football career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPre-draft measurables\n| Height | Weight | Arm length | Hand span | 40-yard dash | 10-yard split | 20-yard split | 20-yard shuttle | Three-cone drill | Vertical jump | Bench press |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5\u00a0ft 10+1\u20442\u00a0in(1.79\u00a0m)\n | 222\u00a0lb(101\u00a0kg)\n | 31+3\u20444\u00a0in(0.81\u00a0m)\n | 9\u00a0in(0.23\u00a0m) | 4.62 s | 1.60 s | 2.67 s | 4.30 s | 7.50 s | 33.0\u00a0in(0.84\u00a0m) | 21 reps |\n| All values from NFL Combine/Pro Day[6][7] |\n\n\n### Chicago Bears[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cedric Benson practicing at the Chicago Bears 2007 Training Camp.\nThe Chicago Bears selected Benson in the first round with the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft.[8][9] Benson was visibly upset upon being drafted by Chicago, as the two parties disagreed on contract terms prior to the draft.[9] After a 36-day contract hold-out, Benson and the Bears finally agreed to a five-year contract worth $35 million, with a $16 million signing bonus.[9] The Bears wished to make Benson their feature running back, but his lengthy contract impasse had caused him to miss the team's entire training camp.[10] Benson claimed that he received a cold reception upon his return because he claimed he would be starting by the third game despite holding out and not practicing.[11] Jay Glazer reported that certain players even attempted to intentionally injure him during practice.[12]\n\n\nThe team temporarily made Thomas Jones their featured running back for the beginning of the 2005 season.[10] Jones' performance impressed the Bears' coaching staff, and earned him the top spot on the team's depth-chart for the next two seasons. Benson occasionally received playtime, and he rushed for eighty yards on sixteen carries against the New Orleans Saints during his best game. However, shortly afterwards, he suffered a medial collateral ligament sprain and missed most of the remaining season.[13]\n\n\nAfter the 2005 the Bears considered making Benson the team's starting running back after Jones was unhappy with his current contract status. The team's plans went astray when Benson injured his shoulder after colliding with Brian Urlacher during a routine scrimmage. Although the injury was not serious, it placed Benson on the sidelines for a majority of the preseason.\n\n\nAlthough Benson fully recovered from his injury, head coach Lovie Smith selected Jones as the Bears' starter. Benson scored his first two touchdowns during week five of the 2006 season, against the Buffalo Bills. In a game against the New England Patriots during week twelve of the season, Benson collided with linebacker Junior Seau, causing Seau to fall down and fracture his forearm.\n\n\nDays later, Benson challenged Smith's coaching by remarking, \"the NFL is not like high school or college, but the best players don't always get on the field.\"[14] The following week, Benson out rushed Jones and scored a vital touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings on 4th down. However, when asked about it after the game, he said he didn't know that it was 4th down. He began to receive more carries as the weeks progressed, and managed to rush for over 100 yards against the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\nBenson became the Bears' secondary running back again during the playoffs. In the 2006 NFC Championship game against the New Orleans Saints, Benson scored a fourth-quarter touchdown and totaled 60 yards. Though he was given a majority of the team's carries, his counterpart, Jones, amassed two touchdowns and 123 rushing yards.[15] In the team's following game, Super Bowl XLI, Benson sustained a knee injury in the first half, and missed the remainder of the game.\n\n\nSmith named Benson as the Bears' starting running back after the team traded Jones to the New York Jets. Benson struggled throughout the preseason, but received enough support from his teammates and coaches to retain his starting position.[16] He amassed only forty-two yards in his first regular season game and committed a costly turnover. However, Benson rebounded with a 101-yard performance during his next start. After several inconsistent games, Benson began to stabilize after the bye week. In one of his best games of the season, Benson rushed for eighty-nine yards and scored one touchdown on eleven attempts. He averaged 5.8 yards in his next game, but sustained a season-ending ankle injury.[17] Benson, who had amassed 647 yards and four touchdowns, was eventually relieved by Adrian N. Peterson.[17]\n\n\nJerry Angelo, the Bears' general manager, had expressed interest in acquiring a new running back to revitalize the Bears' running game, which finished last in yards in the league.[17] Upon hearing the news, Benson commented, \"You all know the competition that goes on around here. It doesn't matter to me. Maybe somebody else can get some criticism.\"[17] On June 9, 2008, Benson was released by the Bears following his second alcohol-related arrest in five weeks.[18]\n\n\nIn October 2009, Benson confirmed that shortly before he was released by the Bears, he had been diagnosed with Celiac disease.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Benson running after taking a handoff from Carson Palmer against the New York Jets in the 2009\u201310 AFC wild card game. In September 2016, Benson stated that \"no year in Chicago was I happy.\".[20]\n\n\n### Cincinnati Bengals[edit]\n\n\nShortly after the grand jury failed to indict him on both incidents in Austin, Benson signed a one-year, $520,000 contract with the Cincinnati Bengals on September 30, 2008. DeDe Dorsey was placed on injured reserve and Chris Perry was the starter. Benson's season began in a loss to the Dallas Cowboys, rushing 10 times for 30 yards. He became the starting back for the Bengals in Week 7 against the Pittsburgh Steelers.[21] Benson rushed 14 times for 52 yards in his first career start as a Bengal. In the following 35\u20136 loss to the Houston Texans, he totaled 49 yards on 13 carries and had two receptions for 20 yards. The Bengals picked up their first victory of the season in a 21\u201319 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, with Benson carrying 24 times for 104 yards and a touchdown. Benson hit his stride in the Bengals' three-game winning streak at the end of the season, gashing the Washington Redskins in week 15 with 161 yards from scrimmage, including 88 yards receiving (79 of which came on a screen pass). In week 16, Benson dominated the Cleveland Browns, rushing for 171 yards. In the final game of the season against the Kansas City Chiefs, Benson had 111 yards on 25 carries. In the twelve games he was active during the 2008 season, Benson had 932 yards from scrimmage: 747 rushing and 185 receiving.\n\n\nA free agent after the 2008 season, Benson visited with the Houston Texans before signing a two-year, $7-million contract with the Bengals on March 3, 2009.\n\n\nEntering week 8 of the 2009 season, Benson had 164 carries for an NFL best 720 yards (4.4 per carry average). In week 5, he became the first 100-yard rusher against the Baltimore Ravens in 40 games, when he rushed for 120 yards and a touchdown.[22] In week 7, Benson faced his former team, the Chicago Bears, and rushed for a career-high 189 yards and a touchdown.[23]\n\n\nBenson went on to record his first 1,000-yard rushing season and he set a Bengals franchise record with six games with over 100 rushing yards. He finished the season as the NFL's 8th leading rusher with 1,251 yards, despite playing only 13 games. He then set a Bengals postseason record with 169 rushing yards in their 24\u201314 loss to the New York Jets.\n\n\nThe Bengals declined to resign Benson in 2012. Coach Marvin Lewis later recounted how he explained the decision to Benson: \"'Ced, it's not that I didn't think you could do that on the football field, it was the other [stuff] that I got tired of. When I would go to you and say we're going to rotate the backs [and Benson would take it poorly]. I don't need that anymore.'\"[24]\n\n\n\n### Green Bay Packers[edit]\n\n\nOn August 12, 2012, Benson signed with the Green Bay Packers.[25] The deal was reportedly a one-year contract worth $825,000.\n\n\nOn October 7, 2012, Benson suffered a Lisfranc injury to his foot and was later placed on injured reserve.\n\n\n\n## Professional baseball career[edit]\n\n\nBenson was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 12th round (370th overall) of the 2001 MLB Draft. While Benson did not play in the major leagues, he spent his time with the Dodgers playing in their summer league at Vero Beach. He also played with the Gulf Coast League Dodgers. In 25 at-bats he had 5 hits, 1 run, 3 doubles, 2 triples, and 2 RBIs.[26]\n\n\n\n## NFL career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP\n | Rushing\n | Receiving\n | Fumbles\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Att | Yds | Avg | Lng | TD | FD | Rec | Tgt | Yds | Avg | Lng | TD | FD | Fum | Lost\n |\n| 2005 | CHI | 9 | 67 | 272 | 4.1 | 36 | 0 | 12 | 1 | \u2014 | 3 | 3.0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n |\n| 2006 | CHI | 15 | 157 | 647 | 4.1 | 30 | 6 | 33 | 8 | 10 | 54 | 6.8 | 22 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2007 | CHI | 11 | 196 | 674 | 3.4 | 43 | 4 | 33 | 17 | 27 | 123 | 7.2 | 19 | 0 | 5 | 3 | 2\n |\n| 2008 | CIN | 12 | 214 | 747 | 3.5 | 46 | 2 | 36 | 20 | 26 | 185 | 9.3 | 79 | 0 | 6 | 2 | 1\n |\n| 2009 | CIN | 13 | 301 | 1,251 | 4.2 | 42 | 6 | 57 | 17 | 24 | 111 | 6.5 | 19 | 0 | 5 | 1 | 0\n |\n| 2010 | CIN | 16 | 321 | 1,111 | 3.5 | 26 | 7 | 59 | 28 | 38 | 178 | 6.4 | 24 | 1 | 9 | 7 | 5\n |\n| 2011 | CIN | 15 | 273 | 1,067 | 3.9 | 42 | 6 | 53 | 15 | 22 | 82 | 5.5 | 11 | 0 | 3 | 5 | 2\n |\n| 2012 | GB | 5 | 71 | 248 | 3.5 | 11 | 1 | 10 | 14 | 15 | 97 | 6.9 | 18 | 0 | 4 | 1 | 0\n |\n| Career[27] | 96 | 1,600 | 6,017 | 3.8 | 46 | 32 | 293 | 120 | 162 | 833 | 6.9 | 79 | 1 | 34 | 20 | 11\n |\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBenson's cousin, Aaron, played linebacker for the University of Texas from 2010 to 2013, but gave up the sport in his redshirt senior year.[28]\n\n\nBenson had celiac disease and attributed his adoption of a gluten-free diet to giving him more energy.[29]\n\n\nAfter his NFL career, Benson became a loan originator.[30]\n\n\n\n### Legal troubles[edit]\n\n\n#### 2008 arrests[edit]\n\n\nBefore the start of the 2008 season, Benson was arrested for allegedly operating a boat while intoxicated and resisting arrest.[31] On May 3, 2008, the incident occurred near Austin, Texas, by the Lower Colorado River Authority during a late night safety inspection.[31] The official police report cited that Benson had failed a field sobriety test, and became hostile towards the police.[31] The officers arrested Benson, and when he forcefully resisted arrest used pepper-spray.[32] Benson was later detained for the night, and charged with boating while intoxicated and resisting arrest.[32]\n\n\nBenson later refuted the charges against him, and stated he requested to take a follow-up field sobriety test on land after failing the initial one.[32] Benson had further accused the officers of abusing him, stating, \"I'm not handcuffed. I'm not under arrest. I'm not threatening him. I'm not pushing him. I'm not touching him. And he sprays me right in the eye.\"[32] He also asserts that officers continuously struck his ankles and feet to prevent him from walking properly.[33] A female passenger on Benson's boat also claimed to have witnessed the abuse and called her father out of fear for Benson's safety. Her fianc\u00e9, also on the boat, may have had dozens of pictures confirming Benson's account.[34]\n\n\nUpon hearing about the incident, Bears' head coach Lovie Smith stated, \"I haven't had a chance to speak with Cedric yet, but anytime we're talking about one of our players getting arrested, you're disappointed in it,\" and added \"What we're going to do from here, I'll go back and try to get as much information as I possibly can and go from there.\"[35]\n\n\nBenson was arrested for driving while intoxicated in Austin, Texas, on June 7, 2008. While returning from a restaurant with his girlfriend, police claimed that Benson drove through a red light, and failed a field sobriety test.[36] Police claimed he later refused to take a breath or blood test to determine his blood alcohol level.[36] Police detained Benson, who was released him on bond. Benson denied the police officers' allegations and insisted that he \"aced\" the field test.[37] Bears general manager Jerry Angelo commented, \"It's unfortunate. Disappointment is too much an often used word when we're talking about Cedric. The No. 1 lesson for every player is protect your job. We're all held accountable for our actions. I'm not going to say any more than that until we know for sure what the facts are.\"[38] On the following Monday, Benson was waived from the Bears. Angelo commented on the release, stating \"Cedric displayed a pattern of behavior we will not tolerate... As I said this past weekend, you have to protect your job. Everyone in this organization is held accountable for their actions.\"[39]\n\n\nBenson was later ordered by a county judge to put a built-in ignition interlock breathalyzer in his car. He was also told to start drug counseling classes.[40] Benson was cleared of all charges in September, after appearing before two grand juries in Travis County.[41]\n\n\n\n#### 2010 arrest[edit]\n\n\nOn June 29, 2010, Benson was arrested for assault with injury after reportedly punching a bartender in the face.[42] Benson himself denied committing the crime. Almost a month later the NFL announced that Benson would not be suspended.[43]\n\n\n\n#### 2011 arrest[edit]\n\n\nOn July 17, 2011, Benson was arrested in Austin, Texas, for a misdemeanor charge of assault causing bodily injury to a family member.[44] He was sentenced to 20 days in jail and ordered to pay a $4,000 fine.[45] Benson was released from jail on September 3, after only five days of his sentence.[46] He received a one-game suspension, enacted in week 8.\n\n\n\n#### 2017 arrest[edit]\n\n\nOn February 18, 2017, Benson was charged with driving while intoxicated in downtown Austin, Texas.[47] According to court documents, Benson refused to take a field sobriety test and could not recite the alphabet from G to Z nor count past the number 3. Benson was released on the same day after posting bond.\n\n\n\n## Death and legacy[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, 2019, Benson and a female passenger, Aamna Najam, were killed when his motorcycle crashed with a minivan on RM 2222 in Austin, Texas. Benson and Najam were pronounced dead at the scene, and the two occupants of the minivan were not seriously injured.[48]\n\n\nOn the two year anniversary of Benson's death, his family and the Austin Independent School District launched a mentorship program in his honor at Gus Garcia Young Men's Leadership Academy.[49]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of NCAA Division I FBS running backs with at least 50 career rushing touchdowns\n* List of NCAA major college football yearly scoring leaders\n* List of Texas Longhorns football All-Americans\n* List of Chicago Bears first-round draft picks\n* List of people diagnosed with coeliac disease\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Texas High School Football Rushing Career Yardage Leaders Lone Star Gridiron\n2. **^** George, Patrick (June 7, 2008). \"Chicago Bears running back Cedric Benson arrested on drunken driving charge\". *Austin American-Statesman*.

He played college football for the California Golden Bears, earning consensus All-American recognition. Arrington was selected by the Arizona Cardinals in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He also played for the Denver Broncos and had a brief stint with the Philadelphia Eagles and Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League (UFL). He also was the last player to get the Pop Warner Award.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\nArrington was born in Nashville, North Carolina. He attended Northern Nash High School and was a letterman in football as a tailback. In football, he was a three-year varsity starter and a two-time All-Conference selection. He was also named his team's Most Valuable Player and the Area Offensive Player of the Year as a senior.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nArrington was sent to College of the Canyons by East Carolina University with the intent that he would play for the Pirates in two years. As a sophomore at College of the Canyons, he won All-Region III honors (which is selected by the California Community College Football Coaches Association and the Junior College Athletic Bureau) and had 135 rushing attempts for 769 yards (5.7 yards per rushing attempt average), and caught 30 passes for 320 yards (10.67 yards per reception average). His 19 touchdowns that season, and 29 career touchdowns, were both school records.\n\n\nArrington transferred to the University of California, Berkeley as a junior, and played for the California Golden Bears football team in 2003 and 2004. Arrington would receive few carries for most of the 2003 season aside from his 114-yard performance against Southern Mississippi. A knee injury to then starting running back Adimchinobi Echemandu would thrust Arrington into the starting role against the Washington Huskies. This proved to be his breakout game as he mauled the Huskies defense for 185 yards and a touchdown. It took him only 14 carries to achieve this feat. In the first half managed to tally 157 yards on ten carries. He also caught a 30-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers giving him a total of 215 yards on the day.\n\n\nDespite his performance, he would receive limited carries for the rest of the 2003 season. He did play a pivotal role in the Insight Bowl by catching five passes for 38 yards, including a 13-yard touchdown pass that would reduce Virginia Tech's lead to only 28\u201321 at halftime. Cal would ultimately prevail 52\u201349 on a game-winning field goal.\n\n\nThe 2004 season would see Arrington earn the starting tailback spot after the departure of Echemandu for the NFL. Arrington played a major role in the Cal Bears' first 10-win season since 1949. He would rush for at least 100 yards in every single game that season. Arrington rushed for 169 yards or more in eight of his team's 12 games as well.\n\n\nUltimately Arrington would have one of the greatest seasons of any running back in NCAA and Pac-10 history, gaining 2,018 rushing yards that season. He became only the third Pac-10 Tailback to gain over 2,000 yards, joining USC tailbacks Marcus Allen and Charles White. His mark is also the tenth best total in NCAA history. He would receive the honor of the Pop Warner Award, deeming him the best College Football player on the west coast. He would also earn All-American and All-Pacific-10 conference honors.\n\n\nUltimately, the season would end in disappointment. Despite a 10\u20131 record, the Bears were bypassed for a BCS Bowl bid by The University of Texas. As a result, they played in the Pacific Life Holiday Bowl against a 7-4 Texas Tech squad, where Cal was defeated by a score of 45\u201331, to end Arrington's college career.\n\n\nIn addition, Arrington was not invited to the Heisman Trophy ceremony (a distinction afforded the top three to five likely winners) despite having a better statistical year (15 TDs, 2,018 yards rushing, 6.98 yards per carry) than the number 2 vote-getter, Adrian Peterson (15 TDs, 1,925 yards rushing, 5.68 yards per carry).\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPre-draft measurables\n| Height | Weight | Arm length | Hand span | 40-yard dash | 10-yard split | 20-yard split | 20-yard shuttle | Three-cone drill | Vertical jump | Broad jump | Bench press |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5\u00a0ft 8+7\u20448\u00a0in(1.75\u00a0m)\n | 214\u00a0lb(97\u00a0kg)\n | 30+1\u20442\u00a0in(0.77\u00a0m)\n | 8+3\u20444\u00a0in(0.22\u00a0m) | 4.46 s | 1.54 s | 2.57 s | 4.10 s | 6.81 s | 35.0\u00a0in(0.89\u00a0m) | 10\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in(3.07\u00a0m) | 18 reps |\n| All values from NFL Combine[1][2] |\n\n\n### Arizona Cardinals[edit]\n\n\nAfter drafting him in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft,[3] the Cardinals placed him as the starting running back on the depth chart, with the intention of having him share carries with Marcel Shipp. He started the first game against the New York Giants gaining 5 yards on 8 carries (0.625 average). After this poor showing in his first game, he didn't play a snap the second game of the season against the St. Louis Rams. By the end of the season, he had played 15 games with 5 starts, gaining 370 yards on 112 carries (3.3 average) and 2 touchdowns. That following offseason the Cardinals signed Edgerrin James.\n\n\nThe Cardinals' drafting of Tim Hightower in 2008 resulted in Arrington being shifted to third place on the depth chart at running back. He became the team's principal kick returner and in Super Bowl XLIII caught 2 passes for 35 yards.\n\n\n\n### Denver Broncos[edit]\n\n\nArrington signed with the Denver Broncos on March 4, 2009. He was released on May 27, 2009, after failing his physical.[4] It was determined that Arrington would need season-ending microfracture surgery on his right knee,[5] following surgery to the same knee in February. He was re-signed on March 4, 2010.\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia Eagles[edit]\n\n\nArrington was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for linebacker Joe Mays on July 30, 2010.[6] He was waived on September 3. Due to Arrington being released prior to the start of the season, the Eagles received a 2012 sixth-round draft pick from the Broncos.[7]\n\n\n\n### Las Vegas Locomotives[edit]\n\n\nBefore the 2011 season, Arrington signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of college football yearly rushing leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"2005 Draft Scout J.J.
