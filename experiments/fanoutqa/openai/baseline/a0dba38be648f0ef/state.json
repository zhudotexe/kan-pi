The presidency is a part of the system of people's congress based on the principle of unified power in which the National People's Congress (NPC) functions as the only branch of government and as the highest state organ of power. The presidency is a state organ of the NPC and equivalent to, for instance, the State Council and the National Supervisory Commission, rather than a political office, unlike the premier of the State Council. Together with the NPC Standing Committee, the presidency performs certain heads of state functions. The president can engage in state affairs with the consent of the NPC Standing Committee. While the presidency is not a powerful organ in itself, since 27 March 1993, the president has concurrently served as general secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and chairman of the Central Military Commission, making the incumbent China's paramount leader and commander-in-chief.\n\n\nThe first state representative of the People's Republic of China was the chairman of the Central People's Government, which was established on 1 October 1949 by a decision of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It was replaced in Constitution in 1954 with the office of state chairman. It was successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, after which the presidency became vacant. The post of chairman was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, and the function of state representative was bestowed on the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee. The office was reinstated in the Constitution of 1982 but with reduced powers. Since 1982, the title's official English-language translation has been \"president\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.[note 1]\n\n\nDuring the Mao era, there were no term limits for the presidency. Between 1982 and 2018, the constitution stipulated that the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms. In 2018, term limits were abolished in order to align the presidency with the position of CCP general secretary, which does not have term limits. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Establishment in 1954[edit]\n\n\nThe office of state chairman (the original English translation) was first established under the 1954 Constitution.[2] Though the ceremonial powers of the office were largely identical to those in the current Constitution, the powers of the 1954 office differed from those of the current office in two areas: military and governmental.[2] The state chairman's military powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China commands the armed forces of the state, and is chairman of the National Defence Council (Chinese: \u56fd\u9632\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a).\"[2] The National Defence Council was unique to the 1954 Constitution, and was mandated as the civil command for the People's Liberation Army. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution.\n\n\nThe state chairman's governmental powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China, whenever necessary, convenes a Supreme State Conference (Chinese: \u6700\u9ad8\u56fd\u52a1\u4f1a\u8bae) and acts as its chairman.\"[2] The members of the Supreme State Conference included the main officers of state, and its views were to be presented to the main organs of state and government, including the National People's Congress and the State and National Defense Councils.[2] The Supreme State Conference was also unique to the 1954 Constitution. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution and later Constitutions have not included a similar body.\n\n\n\n### History up to 1974[edit]\n\n\nCCP Chairman Mao Zedong was the first to hold the office of state chairman. He was elected at the founding session of the National People's Congress in 1954. At the 2nd NPC in 1959, Mao was succeeded by Liu Shaoqi, first-ranked Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Liu was reelected as state chairman at the 3rd NPC in Jan 1965. However, in 1966, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution and by August 1966 Mao and his supporters succeeding in removing Liu from his position as party vice chairman. A few months later Liu was apparently placed under house arrest, and after a prolonged power struggle the 12th Plenum of the 8th Communist Party Congress stripped Liu Shaoqi of all his party and non-party positions on 31 October 1968, including the post of state chairman. This was in violation of the Constitution, which required a vote by the NPC to remove the state chairman.[*citation needed*] After Liu's removal in 1968, the office of state chairman was vacant. From 1972 to 1975, however, state media referred to Vice State Chairman Dong Biwu as \"acting state chairman\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Abolition in 1975[edit]\n\n\nWhen the 4th NPC was convened in 1975, its main act was to adopt a new Constitution which eliminated the office of state chairman and emphasized instead the leadership of the Communist Party over the state, including an article that made the CCP chairman supreme commander of the PLA in concurrence as chairman of the party CMC, while the duties of state representative were transferred to the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.[3] The 5th NPC was convened two years early, in 1978, and a third Constitution was adopted, which also lacked the office of state chairman, but did place a greater emphasis on the ceremonial roles performed by the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress as state representative.[4][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n### Restoration in 1982[edit]\n\n\nWhen it was agreed to amend the constitution again in 1980, questions to whether to restore the presidency arose. Research showed that having the NPCSC chairman as the national representative created problems, as the position was equivalent to the speaker of parliament in other countries. Deng Xiaoping agreed to restore the presidency, but without powers in specific government affairs.[4]\n\n\nThe office was reinstated in the fourth Constitution, adopted by the 5th Session of the 5th NPC in 1982.[4] In the 1982 Constitution, the party developed policy while the state executed it, and the president was conceived of as a ceremonial and replacement figure with a role similar to that of equivalent of figurehead presidents in parliamentary republics. Actual state power was vested in the general secretary of the Communist Party, the premier, and the chairman of the Central Military Commission. As part of the effort to prevent another leader from rising above the party as Mao had done, all four posts were intended to be held by separate people. The president therefore performed ceremonial duties such as greeting foreign dignitaries and signing the appointment of embassy staff, and did not intervene in the affairs of the State Council or the party. The constitution also mandated term limits for the office, stipulating the president and vice president could not serve more than two consecutive terms.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe posts of the premier, president and CCP general secretary were held by different individuals in the 1980s. That said, in reality political power was concentrated on Deng Xiaoping, effectively the paramount leader, who controlled the Party, government and the military from \"behind the scenes\" without holding any of the three posts. However, presidents Li Xiannian (1983\u20131988) and Yang Shangkun (1988\u20131993) were not simple figureheads, but actually significant players in the highest leadership. They derived most of their power from being amongst the Eight Elders, rather than the office of president.[5]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the experiment of separating party and state posts, which led to conflict between Deng Xiaoping and Zhao Ziyang during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, was terminated. In 1993, Jiang Zemin, who had been general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the Central Military Commission since 1989, assumed the presidency as well, becoming the undisputed top leader of the party and the state.[6][7] Jiang stepped down as president in 2003, handing the post to then\u2013Vice President Hu Jintao, the first vice president to assume the office. Hu had already become general secretary in 2002. In turn, Hu vacated both offices for Xi Jinping in 2012 and 2013, who had also previously served as vice president under Hu.[8]\n\n\nOn March 11, 2018, the first session of the 13th National People's Congress, by a vote of 2,958 in favor, two opposed and three abstaining, passed a constitutional amendment that removed the previous term limits for the president and the vice president.[9] Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align the presidency with his more powerful posts of general secretary of the party and CMC chairman, which do not have term limits.[10]\n\n\n\n## Selection[edit]\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nArticle 79 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for being elected for the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\n\n\n\n* be a Chinese citizen;\n* have the right to vote and stand for election;\n* be at least 45 years old.[11][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n### Election[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Organic Law of the National People's Congress (NPC), constitutionally China's highest organ of state power, the president is nominated by the NPC Presidium, the Congress's executive organ.[12][*non-primary source needed*] However, the nomination is effectively made by the Chinese Communist Party, with the decisions being made among Party leaders.[13] Although the Presidium could theoretically nominate multiple candidates for the presidency, leading the election to be competitive, it has always nominated a single candidate for the office.[13]\n\n\nAfter the nomination, the president is elected by the NPC, which also has the power to remove the president and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote.[11][*non-primary source needed*] The length of the president's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years.[11] Since 2018, the president is required to recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.[13]\n\n\n\n## Powers and duties[edit]\n\n\nThe president functions as the state representative of the PRC as well as the supreme representative of China both internally and externally.[14] According to the constitution, the presidency is not a position but a state institution that represents the PRC in state activities, but the presidency is served by one person.[4][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nUnder the current constitution, instated in 1982 with minor revisions in later years, the president has the power to promulgate laws, select and dismiss the premier (head of government), vice premiers, state councilors as well as ministers of the State Council, grant presidential pardons, declare states of emergency, issue mass mobilization orders, and issue state honors. In addition, the president names and dismisses ambassadors to foreign countries, and signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities. According to the Constitution, all of these powers require the approval or confirmation of the National People's Congress (NPC),[11][*non-primary source needed*] which the office is subject to.[14]\n\n\nThe president also conducts state visits on behalf of the People's Republic.[note 2] Under the constitution, the \"state visit\" clause is the only presidential power that does not stipulate any form of oversight from the NPC. As the vast majority of presidential powers are dependent on the ratification of the NPC, the president is, in essence, a symbolic post without any direct say in the governance of state. It is therefore conceived to mainly function as a symbolic institution of the state rather than an office with true executive powers.[15][16][17]\n\n\nIn theory, the president has discretion over the selection of the premier, though in practice the premier has historically been selected through the top-level discussions of the Chinese Communist Party. Upon the nomination of the premier, the NPC convenes to confirm the nomination, but since only one name is on the ballot, it can only approve or reject. To date, it has never rejected a personnel nomination.[18] Since the premier, the head of government in China, is the most important political appointment in the Chinese government, the nomination power, under some circumstances, may give the president real political influence.[19]\n\n\nThe director of the Office of the President of the PRC (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u4e3b\u5e2d\u529e\u516c\u5ba4; pinyin: *Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3 Zh\u01d4x\u00ed B\u00e0ng\u014dngsh\u00ec*) is Cai Qi, who is also the director of the CCP General Office and the director of the CCP General Secretary Office.[20]\n\n\n\n## Political ranking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orders of precedence in China\n\nThe political ranking of the presidency has changed throughout the decades, influenced by the officeholder of the time. 2nd President Liu Shaoqi was also the first-ranked vice chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, and ranked second in the Chinese Communist Party, behind CCP Chairman Mao Zedong.[21] President Li Xiannian was also the 5th ranked member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, after the CCP general secretary and Chinese premier.[22] President Yang Shangkun was not a member of CCP Politburo Standing Committee, but he ranked third after CCP General Secretary Zhao Ziyang/Jiang Zemin and CMC Chairman Deng Xiaoping.[23] Since Jiang Zemin's accession to the office in 1993, the president has also the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, ranking first in party and state.[24]\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on**Orders of succession** |\n| Presidencies |\n| * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Brazil\n* Colombia\n* China\n* DR Congo\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Ireland\n* Republic of Korea\n* Mexico\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Romania\n* Sri Lanka\n* Taiwan\n* United States\n* Uruguay\n* Vietnam\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n## Post title[edit]\n\n\nThe title of the office (Chinese: \u56fd\u5bb6\u4e3b\u5e2d; pinyin: *Gu\u00f3ji\u0101 Zh\u01d4x\u00ed*), which literally translates to \"state chairman\", was unchanged in the Chinese text, but a new English translation of \"President of the People's Republic of China\" has been adopted since 1982, instead of \"Chairman of the People's Republic of China\".[16]\n\n\n\n## Order of succession[edit]\n\n\nArticle 84 of the Constitution of China. If the office of president falls vacant, then the vice president succeeds to the office. If both offices fall vacant, then the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee temporarily acts as president until the NPC can elect a new president and vice president.[25]\n\n\n\n## List of state representatives[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of state representatives of the People's Republic of China.\n\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n### Chairmen[edit]\n\n\n* ![Mao Zedong (27 September 1954 \u2013 27 April 1959;

The president is the nominal head of the executive,[a] the first citizen of the country, as well as the supreme commander of the Indian Armed Forces. Droupadi Murmu is the 15th and current president, having taken office from 25 July 2022.\n\n\nThe office of president was created when India became a republic on 26 January 1950 when its constitution came into force. The president is indirectly elected by an electoral college comprising both houses of the Parliament of India and the legislative assemblies of each of India's states and territories, who themselves are all directly elected by the citizens.\n\n\nArticle 53 of the Constitution of India states that the president can exercise their powers directly or by subordinate authority, though all of the executive powers vested in the president are, in practice, exercised by the prime minister heading the Council of Ministers.[3] The president is bound by the constitution to act on the advice of the Council and to enforce the decrees passed by the Supreme Court under article 142.\n\n\n\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\n\nIndia achieved independence from the British on 15 August 1947, initially as a dominion within the Commonwealth of Nations with George VI as king, represented in the country by a governor-general.[4] Following independence, the Constituent Assembly of India, under the leadership of B. R. Ambedkar, undertook the process of drafting a completely new constitution for the country. The Constitution of India was eventually enacted on 26 November 1949 and came into force on 26 January 1950,[5]:\u200a26 making India a republic.[6]:\u200a9 The offices of monarch and governor-general were replaced by the new office of President of India, with Rajendra Prasad as its first incumbent.[6]:\u200a1 India retained its Commonwealth membership per the London Declaration, recognising The King as \"the symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth.\"[7]\n\n\nThe Indian constitution accords to the president the responsibility and authority to defend and protect the Constitution of India and its rule of law.[8] Invariably, any action taken by the executive or legislature entities of the constitution shall become law only after the president's assent. The president shall not accept any actions of the executive or legislature which are unconstitutional. The president is the foremost, most empowered and prompt defender of the constitution (Article 60), who has pre-emptive power for ensuring constitutionality in the actions of the executive or legislature. The role of the judiciary in upholding the Constitution of India is the second line of defence in nullifying any unconstitutional actions of the executive and legislative entities of the Indian Union.\n\n\n\n## Powers and duties[edit]\n\n\n\n> Under the draft constitution the President occupies the same position as the King under the English Constitution. He is the head of the state but not of the Executive. He represents the Nation but does not rule the Nation. He is the symbol of the Nation. His place in the administration is that of a ceremonial device on a seal by which the nation's decisions are made known.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aBhimrao Ambedkar, as chairperson of the drafting committee of the Constituent Assembly of India during various debates about the president being constitutional head of the state.[9][10]\n> \n\n\n### Duty[edit]\n\n\nThe primary duty of the president is to preserve, protect and defend the constitution and the law of India as made part of their oath (Article 60 of Indian constitution).[8] The president is the common head of all independent constitutional entities. All their actions, recommendations (Article 3, Article 111, Article 274, etc.) and supervisory powers (Article 74(2), Article 78C, Article 108, Article 111, etc.) over the executive and legislative entities of India shall be used in accordance to uphold the constitution.[11] There is no bar on the actions of the president to contest in the court of law.[12]\n\n\n\n### Legislative powers[edit]\n\n\nLegislative power is constitutionally vested in the Parliament of India of which the president is the head, to facilitate the lawmaking process per the constitution (Article 78, Article 86, etc.). The president summons both the houses (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) of the parliament and prorogues them. They can dissolve the Lok Sabha.[5]:\u200a147\n\n\nThe president inaugurates parliament by addressing it after the general elections and also at the beginning of the first session every year per Article 87(1). The presidential address on these occasions is generally meant to outline the new policies of the government.[13]:\u200a145\n\n\nAll bills passed by the parliament can become laws only after receiving the assent of the president per Article 111. After a bill is presented to them, the president shall declare either that they assent to the Bill, or that they withhold assent from it. As a third option, they can return a bill to parliament, if it is not a money bill, for reconsideration. President may be of the view that a particular bill passed under the legislative powers of parliament is violating the constitution, they can send back the bill with their recommendation to pass the bill under the constituent powers of parliament following the Article 368 procedure. When, after reconsideration, the bill is passed accordingly and presented to the president, with or without amendments, the president cannot withhold their assent from it. The president can also withhold their assent to a bill when it is initially presented to them (rather than return it to parliament) thereby exercising a pocket veto on the advice of the prime minister or council of ministers per Article 74 if it is inconsistent with the constitution.[12] Article 143 gives the president the power to consult the supreme court about the constitutional validity of an issue. The president shall assent to constitutional amendment bills without power to withhold the bills per Article 368 (2).\n\n\nWhen either of the two Houses of the Parliament of India is not in session, and if the government feels the need for an immediate procedure, the president can promulgate ordinances that have the same force and effect as an act passed by parliament under its legislative powers. These are in the nature of interim or temporary legislation and their continuance is subject to parliamentary approval. Ordinances remain valid for no more than six weeks from the date the parliament is convened unless approved by it earlier.[14] Under Article 123, the president as the upholder of the constitution shall be satisfied that immediate action is mandatory as advised by the union cabinet and they are confident that the government commands majority support in the parliament needed for the passing of the ordinance into an act and parliament can be summoned to deliberate on the passing of the ordinance as soon as possible. The promulgated ordinance is treated as an act of parliament when in force and it is the responsibility of the president to withdraw the ordinance as soon as the reasons for the promulgation of the ordinance are no longer applicable. Bringing laws in the form of ordinances has become a routine matter by the government and president, but the provisions made in Article 123 are meant for mitigating unusual circumstances where immediate action is inevitable when the extant provisions of the law are inadequate. Re-promulgation of an ordinance after failing to get approval within the stipulated time of both houses of parliament is an unconstitutional act by the president.[15] The president should not incorporate any matter in an ordinance which violates the constitution or requires an amendment to the constitution. The president should take moral responsibility when an ordinance elapses automatically or is not approved by the parliament or violates the constitution.[16] Thus, it is believed that the POI is the de jure head of the state, whereas PM is the de facto head.\n\n\n\n### Executive powers[edit]\n\n\n\n> The President of the Indian Union will be generally bound by the advice of his Ministers. ... He can do nothing contrary to their advice nor can do anything without their advice. The President of the United States can dismiss any Secretary at any time. The President of the Indian Union has no power to do so, so long as his Ministers command a majority in Parliament\n> \n> \u2014\u200aBhimrao Ambedkar, chairperson of the drafting committee of the Constituent Assembly of India[9]\n> \n\n\n![](image)Presidential Standard of India (1950\u20131971)\nAs per Article 53, the executive power of the country is vested in the president and is exercised by the president either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the constitution. When parliament thinks fit it may accord additional executive powers to the president per Article 70 which may be further delegated by the president to the governors of states per Article 160. Union cabinet with prime minister as its head, should aid and advise the president in performing their functions. Per Article 74 (2), the council of ministers or prime minister are not accountable legally to the advice tendered to the president but it is the sole responsibility of the president to ensure compliance with the constitution in performing their duties. President or their subordinate officers is bound by the provisions of the constitution notwithstanding any advice by the union cabinet.[17]\n\n\nAs per Article 142, it is the duty of the president to enforce the decrees of the supreme court.\n\n\n\n### Judicial powers[edit]\n\n\nThe primary duty of the president is to preserve, protect and defend the constitution and the law of India per Article 60. The president appoints the Chief Justice of India and other judges on the advice of the chief justice. The President may dismiss a judge with a two-thirds vote of the two Houses of the parliament.[18]\n\n\nThe Indian government's chief legal adviser, Attorney General of India, is appointed by the president of India under Article 76(1) and holds office during the pleasure of the president. If the president considers a question of law or a matter of public importance has arisen, they can also ask for the advisory opinion of the supreme court per Article 143. Per Article 88, the president can ask the attorney general to attend the parliamentary proceedings and report to him any unlawful functioning if any.[19]\n\n\n\n### Appointment powers[edit]\n\n\nThe president appoints as prime minister, the person most likely to command the support of the majority in the Lok Sabha (usually the leader of the majority party or coalition). The president then appoints the other members of the Council of Ministers, distributing portfolios to them on the advice of the prime minister.[20]:\u200a72 The Council of Ministers remains in power at the 'pleasure' of the president.\n\n\nThe president appoints 12 members of the Rajya Sabha from amongst persons who have special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as literature, science, art and social service. The president may nominate not more than two members of Anglo Indian community as Lok Sabha members per Article 331, which was removed in 2019.\n\n\nGovernors of states are also appointed by the president who shall work at the pleasure of the president. Per Article 156, the president is empowered to dismiss a governor who has violated the constitution in their acts.\n\n\nThe president is responsible for making a wide variety of appointments. These include:[20]:\u200a72\n\n\n\n* The Chief Justice of India and other judges of the Supreme Court of India and state/union territory high courts.\n* The Chief Minister of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Article 239 AA 5 of the constitution).\n* The Comptroller and Auditor General Of India.\n* The Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners.\n* The Chairman and other members of the Union Public Service Commission.\n* The Attorney General Of India.\n* Ambassadors and High Commissioners to other countries (only through the list of names given by the prime minister).[21][22]:\u200a48\n* Officers of the All India Services (IAS, IPS and IFoS), and other Central Civil Services in Group 'A'.\n\n\n### Financial powers[edit]\n\n\n* A financial bill can be introduced in the parliament only with the president's recommendation.\n* The president lays the Annual Financial Statement, i.e. the Union budget, before the parliament.\n* The president can take advances out of the Contingency Fund of India to meet unforeseen expenses.\n* The president constitutes a Finance Commission every five years to recommend the distribution of the taxes between the centre and the States. The most recent was constituted in 2017.[23][24][25]\n\n\n### Diplomatic powers[edit]\n\n\nAll international treaties and agreements are negotiated and concluded on behalf of the president.[26]:\u200a18 However, in practice, such negotiations are usually carried out by the prime minister along with their Cabinet (especially the Minister of External Affairs). Also, such treaties are subject to the approval of the parliament. The president represents India in international forums and affairs where such a function is chiefly ceremonial. The president may also send and receive diplomats, i.e. the officers from the Indian Foreign Service.[27]:\u200a143 The president is the first citizen of the country.[21]\n\n\n\n### Military powers[edit]\n\n\nThe president is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces. Only the president can declare war or conclude peace,[21] on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers headed by the prime minister. All important treaties and contracts are made in the president's name.[28]\n\n\n\n### Pardoning powers[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Presidential pardon\n\nAs mentioned in Article 72 of the Indian constitution, the president is empowered with the powers to grant pardons in the following situations:[21]\n\n\n\n* punishment for an offence against Union law\n* punishment by a military court\n* a death sentence[28]\n\n\nThe decisions involving pardoning and other rights by the president are independent of the opinion of the prime minister or the Lok Sabha majority. In most cases, however, the president exercises their executive powers on the advice of the prime minister and the cabinet.[20]:\u200a239[29]\n\n\n\n### Emergency powers[edit]\n\n\nThe president can declare three types of emergencies: national, state and financial, under articles 352, 356 & 360 in addition to promulgating ordinances under article 123.[26]:\u200a12\n\n\n\n#### National emergency[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Emergency (India)\n\nA national emergency can be declared in the whole of India or a part of its territory for causes of war or armed rebellion or an external aggression. Such an emergency was declared in India in 1962 (Indo-China war), 1971 (Indo-Pakistan war),[30] and 1975 to 1977 (declared by Indira Gandhi).[see main]\n\n\nUnder Article 352 of the India constitution, the president can declare such an emergency only on the basis of a written request by the cabinet of ministers headed by the prime minister. Such a proclamation must be approved by the parliament with at least a two-thirds majority within one month. Such an emergency can be imposed for six months. It can be extended by six months by repeated parliamentary approval-there is no maximum duration.[26][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nIn such an emergency, Fundamental Rights of Indian citizens can be suspended.[5]:\u200a33 The six freedoms under Right to Freedom are automatically suspended. However, the Right to Life and Personal Liberty cannot be suspended (Article 21).[31]:\u200a20.6\n\n\nThe president can make laws on the 66 subjects of the State List (which contains subjects on which the state governments can make laws).[32] Also, all money bills are referred to the president for approval.[33]:\u200a88 The term of the Lok Sabha can be extended by a period of up to one year, but not so as to extend the term of parliament beyond six months after the end of the declared emergency.[20]:\u200a223\n\n\nNational Emergency has been proclaimed 3 times in India to date. It was declared first in 1962 by President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, during the Sino-Indian War. This emergency lasted through the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and up to 1968. It was revoked in 1968. The second emergency in India was proclaimed in 1971 by President V. V. Giri on the eve of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. The first two emergencies were in the face of external aggression and War. They were hence external emergencies. Even as the second emergency was in progress, another internal emergency was proclaimed by President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, with Indira Gandhi as prime minister in 1975. In 1977, the second and the third emergencies were together revoked.\n\n\n\n#### State emergency[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Federalism in India\n\nIf the president is not fully satisfied, on the basis of the report of the governor of the concerned state or from other sources, that the governance in a state cannot be carried out according to the provisions in the constitution, they can proclaim under Article 356 a state of emergency in the state.[8] Such an emergency must be approved by the parliament within a period of 2 months.\n\n\nUnder Article 356 of the Indian constitution, it can be imposed from six months to a maximum period of three years with repeated parliamentary approval every six months. If the emergency needs to be extended for more than three years, this can be achieved by a constitutional amendment, as has happened in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n\nDuring such an emergency, the president can take over the entire work of the executive, and the governor administers the state in the name of the president. The Legislative Assembly can be dissolved or may remain in suspended animation. The parliament makes laws on the 66 subjects of the state list[34] (see National emergency for explanation).\n\n\nA State Emergency can be imposed via the following:\n\n\n\n1. By Article 356\u00a0\u2013 If that state failed to run constitutionally, i.e. constitutional machinery has failed. When a state emergency is imposed under this provision, the state is said to be under \"President's rule.[35]:\u200a159\n2. By Article 365\u00a0\u2013 If that state is not working according to the direction of the Union government issued per the provisions of the constitution.[36]\n\n\nThis type of emergency needs the approval of the parliament within 2 months. It can last up to a maximum of three years via extensions after each 6-month period. However, after one year it can be extended only if\n\n\n\n1. A state of National Emergency has been declared in the country or the particular state.\n2. The Election Commission finds it difficult to organise an election in that state.\n\n\nThe Sarkaria Commission held that presidents have unconstitutionally misused the provision of Article 356 many times for achieving political motives, by dismissing the state governments although there was no constitutional break down in the states.[37] During 2005, President's rule was imposed in Bihar state, misusing Article 356 unconstitutionally to prevent the democratically elected state legislators to form a government after the state elections.\n\n\nThere is no provision in the constitution to re-promulgate president's rule in a state when the earlier promulgation ceased to operate for want of parliaments approval within two months duration. During 2014 in Andhra Pradesh, president's rule was first imposed on 1 March 2014 and it ceased to operate on 30 April 2014. President's rule was promulgated after being fully aware that the earliest parliament session is feasible at the end of May 2014 after the general elections. It was reimposed again unconstitutionally on 28 April 2014 by the president.[38][39]\n\n\n\n#### Financial emergency[edit]\n\n\nArticle 282 accords financial autonomy in spending the financial resources available with the states for public purposes.[8][40] Article 293 gives liberty to states to borrow without any limit to its ability for its requirements within the territory of India without any consent from the Union government. However, the Union government can insist on compliance with its loan terms when a state has an outstanding loan charged to the consolidated fund of India or an outstanding loan in respect of which a guarantee has been given by the Government of India under the liability of consolidated fund of India.[41]\n\n\nUnder article 360 of the constitution, the president can proclaim a financial emergency when the financial stability or credit of the nation or any part of its territory is threatened.[8] However, until now no guidelines defining the situation of financial emergency in the entire country or a state or union territory or a panchayat or a municipality or a corporation have been framed either by the finance commission or by the central government.\n\n\nSuch an emergency must be approved by the parliament within two months by a simple majority. It has never been declared.[42]:\u200a604 A state of financial emergency remains in force indefinitely until revoked by the president.[20]:\u200a195\n\n\nThe president can reduce the salaries of all government officials, including judges of the supreme court and high courts, in cases of a financial emergency. All money bills passed by state legislatures are submitted to the president for approval. They can direct the state to observe certain principles (economy measures) relating to financial matters.[43]\n\n\n\n## Selection process[edit]\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nArticle 58 of the constitution sets the principal qualifications one must meet to be eligible to the office of the president. A president must be:\n\n\n\n* a citizen of India\n* of 35 years of age or above\n* qualified to become a member of the Lok Sabha\n\n\nA person shall not be eligible for election as president if they hold any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State or any local or other authority subject to the control of any of the said Governments.\n\n\nCertain office-holders, however, are permitted to stand as presidential candidates. These are:\n\n\n\n* The current vice-president\n* The governor of any state\n* A Minister of the Union or of any state (including prime minister and chief ministers)[20]:\u200a72\n\n\nIn the event that the vice-president, a state governor or a minister is elected president, they are considered to have vacated their previous office on the date they begin serving as president.\n\n\nA member of parliament or a State Legislature can seek election to the office of the president but if they are elected as president, they shall be deemed to have vacated their seat in parliament or State Legislature on the date on which they enter upon their office as President **[Article 59(1)]**.\n\n\n**Article 57** provides that a person who holds, or who has held, office as president shall, subject to the other provisions of this constitution, be eligible for re-election to that office.\n\n\nUnder the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952,[44] a candidate to be nominated for the office of president needs 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders for their name to appear on the ballot.[45]\n\n\n\n## Time of election[edit]\n\n\nArticle 56(1) of the constitution provides that the president shall hold office for a term of five years, from the date on which they enter their office. According to Article 62, an election to fill a vacancy caused by the expiration of the term of office of President shall be completed before the expiration of the term. An election to fill a vacancy in the office of President occurring by reason of their death, resignation or removal, or otherwise shall be held as soon as possible after, and in no case later than six months from, the date of occurrence of the vacancy; and the person elected to fill the vacancy shall, subject to the provisions of Article 56, be entitled to hold office for the full term of five years from the date on which they enter their office.\n\n\nTo meet the contingency of an election to the office of President not being completed in time due to unforeseen circumstances like countermanding of an election due to death of a candidate or on account of the postponement of the poll for any valid reason, Article 56(1)(c) provides that the president shall, notwithstanding the expiration of their term, continue to hold office until their successor enters into office.\n\n\n\n### Conditions for the presidency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Electoral College (India)\n\nCertain conditions, per Article 59 of the Indian constitution, debar an otherwise eligible citizen from contesting the presidential elections. The conditions are:\n\n\n\n* The president shall not be a member of either house of the parliament or a house of the legislature of any state, and if a member of either house of the parliament or a house of the legislature of any state is elected president, they shall be deemed to have vacated their seat in that house on the date on which they enter into office as president.\n* The president shall not hold any other office of profit.\n* The president shall be entitled without payment of rent to the use of their official residences and shall be also entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as may be determined by parliament by law and until provision in that behalf is so made, such emoluments, allowances and privileges as are specified in the Second Schedule.\n* The emoluments and allowances of the president shall not be diminished during their term of office.[42]:\u200a170\n\n\n### Election process[edit]\n\n\nWhenever the office becomes vacant, the new president is chosen by an electoral college consisting of the elected members of both houses of parliament (MPs), the elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies (Vidhan Sabha) of all States and the elected members of the legislative assemblies (MLAs) of union territories with legislatures, i.e., National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir and Puducherry. The election process of the president is a more extensive process than of the prime minister who is also elected indirectly (elected by the members of the majority party (or union) in the Lok Sabha). Whereas President being the constitutional head with duties to protect, defend and preserve the constitution and rule of law in a constitutional democracy with constitutional supremacy, is elected in an extensive manner by the members of Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and state legislative assemblies in a secret ballot procedure.\n\n\nThe nomination of a candidate for election to the office of the president must be subscribed by at least 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders. Each candidate has to make a security deposit of \u20b915,000 (US$180) in the Reserve Bank of India.[46] The security deposit is liable to be forfeited in case the candidate fails to secure one-sixth of the votes polled.\n\n\nThe election is held in accordance with the system of proportional representation (PR) by means of the instant-runoff voting (IRV) method.[47] The voting takes place by a secret ballot system. The manner of election of President is provided by Article 55 of the constitution.[48]\n\n\nEach elector casts a different number of votes. The general principle is that the total number of votes cast by Members of parliament equals the total number of votes cast by State Legislators. Also, legislators from larger states cast more votes than those from smaller states. Finally, the number of legislators in state matters; if a state has few legislators, then each legislator has more votes; if a state has many legislators, then each legislator has fewer votes.\n\n\nThe actual calculation for votes cast by a particular state is calculated by dividing the state's population by 1000, which is divided again by the number of legislators from the State voting in the electoral college. This number is the number of votes per legislator in a given state. Every elected member of the parliament enjoys the same number of votes, which may be obtained by dividing the total number of votes assigned to the members of legislative assemblies by the total number of elected representatives of the parliament.\n\n\nAlthough Indian presidential elections involve actual voting by MPs and MLAs, they tend to vote for the candidate supported by their respective parties.[49]\n\n\n\n### Oath or affirmation[edit]\n\n\nThe president is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the Chief Justice of India\u2014or in their absence, the senior-most judge of the supreme court\u2014an oath or affirmation to protect, preserve and defend the constitution as follows:[50]\n\n\n\n\n> I, (name), do swear in the name of God (or solemnly affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President (or discharge the functions of the President) of the Republic of India, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law, and that I will devote myself to the service and well-being of the people of the Republic of India.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aArticle 60, Constitution of India\n> \n\n\n## Emoluments[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Presidential pay**\n| Date updated | Salary (per month)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 February 2018 | \u20b95 lakh (US$6,000)\n |\n| Sources:[51] |\n\n\nThe president of India used to receive \u20b910,000 (US$100) per month per the Second Schedule of the constitution. This amount was increased to \u20b950,000 (equivalent to \u20b9230,000 or US$2,700 in 2023) in 1998. On 11 September 2008, the Government of India increased the salary of the president to \u20b91.5 lakh (equivalent to \u20b94.2 lakh or US$5,000 in 2023). This amount was further increased to \u20b95 lakh (equivalent to \u20b96.7 lakh or US$8,000 in 2023) in the 2018 Union budget of India. However, almost everything that the president does or wants to do is taken care of by an annual \u20b9225 million (equivalent to \u20b9630\u00a0million or US$7.5\u00a0million in 2023) budget that the Government allots for their upkeep.[52] Rashtrapati Bhavan, the president's official residence, is the largest Presidential palace in the world.[53][54] The Rashtrapati Nilayam at Bolarum, Hyderabad and Retreat Building at Chharabra, Shimla are the official Retreat Residences of the president of India. The official state car of the president is a custom-built heavily armored Mercedes Benz S600 (W221) Pullman Guard.\n\n\nThe former presidents and widows and widowers of presidents are eligible for pension, furnished accommodation, security, various allowances, etc.[55]\n\n\n\n* Presidential amenities\n* ![Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the president, located in New Delhi](image)\n\nRashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the president, located in New Delhi\n* ![Rashtrapati Nilayam is the official retreat of the president located in Hyderabad.](image)\n\nRashtrapati Nilayam is the official retreat of the president located in Hyderabad.\n* ![The Retreat Building is the official summer retreat of the president located in Shimla.](image)\n\nThe Retreat Building is the official summer retreat of the president located in Shimla.\n* ![The President's Bodyguards is an elite household cavalry regiment of the Indian Army.](image)\n\nThe President's Bodyguards is an elite household cavalry regiment of the Indian Army.\n* ![A chopper of IAF's special VIP fleet meant for carrying the President of India](image)\n\nA chopper of IAF's special VIP fleet meant for carrying the President of India\n* ![VIP B777 with call sign Air India One (INDIA 1) is used for international travels by the President.](image)\n\nVIP B777 with call sign Air India One (INDIA 1) is used for international travels by the President.\n* ![Indian Air Force's BBJ 737 with call sign Air India One (INDIA 1) is used for domestic travels by the President.](image)\n\nIndian Air Force's BBJ 737 with call sign Air India One (INDIA 1) is used for domestic travels by the President.\n\n\n## Impeachment[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court shall inquire and decide regarding all *doubts* and *disputes* arising out of or in connection with the election of a president per Article 71(1) of the constitution. The Supreme Court can remove the president for the electoral malpractices or upon being not eligible to be a member of the Lok Sabha under the Representation of the People Act, 1951.[56] Subject to Article 71 (3), parliament made applicable rules/procedure to petition the supreme court for resolving the *disputes* only that arise during the election process of the president but not the *doubts* that arise from their unconstitutional actions/deeds or changing Indian citizenship during the tenure of the president which may violate the requisite election qualifications.[57]\n\n\nThe president may also be removed before the expiry of the term through impeachment for violating the Constitution of India by the Parliament of India. The process may start in either of the two houses of the parliament. The house initiates the process by levelling the charges against the president. The charges are contained in a notice that has to be signed by at least one-quarter of the total members of that house. The notice is sent up to the president and 14 days later, it is taken up for consideration.\n\n\nA resolution to impeach the president has to be passed by a two-thirds majority of the total number of members of the originating house. It is then sent to the other house. The other house investigates the charges that have been made. During this process, the president has the right to defend himself through an authorised counsel. If the second house also approves the charges made by the special majority again, the president stands impeached and is deemed to have vacated their office from the date when such a resolution stands passed. No president has faced impeachment proceedings so the above provisions have never been used.[58]\n\n\nUnder Article 361 of the constitution, though the president cannot be summoned for questioning except on their voluntary willingness to testify in the court in support of their controversial deeds, the unconstitutional decisions taken by the president would be declared invalid by the courts. The case would be decided by the courts based on the facts furnished by the Union government for the president's role. As clarified by the supreme court in the case *Rameshwar Prasad & Others vs Union of India & An Other* on 24 January 2006; though the president cannot be prosecuted and imprisoned during their term of office, they can be prosecuted after he/she steps down from the post for any guilt committed during the term of the presidency as declared earlier by the courts.[59] No president has resigned on impropriety to continue in office for declaring and nullifying their unconstitutional decisions by the courts till now. No criminal case at least on the grounds of disrespecting constitution is lodged till now against former presidents to punish them for their unconstitutional acts; though many decisions taken during the term of a president have been declared by the supreme court as unconstitutional, *mala fides*, void, *ultra vires*, etc.[60]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on**Orders of succession** |\n| Presidencies |\n| * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Brazil\n* Colombia\n* China\n* DR Congo\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Ireland\n* Republic of Korea\n* Mexico\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Romania\n* Sri Lanka\n* Taiwan\n* United States\n* Uruguay\n* Vietnam\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n## Succession[edit]\n\n\nThe Office of the president falls vacant in the following scenarios:\n\n\n\n1. On the expiry of their term.\n2. By reason of death.\n3. By reason of resignation.\n4. Removal by the supreme court.\n5. Removal by impeachment.\n\n\nArticle 65 of the Indian constitution says that the Vice-President of India will have to discharge the duties, if the office falls vacant due to any reason other than the expiry of the term.[31]:\u200a20.10 The vice-president reverts to their office when a new president is elected and enters office. When the president is unable to act because of absence, illness or any other cause, the vice-president discharges the president's functions until the president resumes the duties.\n\n\nA vice-president who acts as or discharges the functions of the president has all the powers and immunities of the president and is entitled to the same emoluments as the president. When a vice-president discharges the duties of the president, he/she does not function as the Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha.\n\n\nThe Indian parliament has enacted the law\u2014*The President (Discharge of Functions) Act, 1969* \u2014[61] for the discharge of the functions of the president when vacancies occur in the offices of the president and the vice-president simultaneously, owing to removal, death, resignation of the incumbent or otherwise. In such an eventuality, the chief justice\u2014or in their absence, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court of India available\u2014discharges the functions of the president until a newly elected president enters upon their office or a newly elected vice-president begins to act as president under Article 65 of the constitution, whichever is the earlier.[22]:\u200a96 For example, in 1969, when President Zakir Husain died in Office, Vice-President V. V. Giri served as the acting president of India. However, later, V.V Giri resigned from both posts (Acting President of India and Vice-President of India) as he became a candidate in the 1969 presidential election in India. In this event, the then Chief Justice of India, Justice Mohammad Hidayatullah served as the acting president of India until the next president was elected.\n\n\n\n## President vs Chief Justice[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPresident versus Chief Justice of India\n| President | Chief Justice of India / judiciary\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| The duties of President under their oath is to protect, defend and preserve the constitution and the law | Similar to president to uphold the constitution and the laws (Third Schedule of the constitution)[8] |\n| The oath is taken in the presence of the chief justice | The oath is taken in the presence of the president\n |\n| Impeachment by parliament with a majority of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of each house of the parliament for violation of the constitution as per Article 61. | Removal from office by each house of the parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that house and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that house present and voting on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity as per Article 124(4) |\n| President can be removed by the supreme court per Article 71(1) for committing electoral malpractices and upon ceasing to possess the requisite qualifications to be president. | President cannot remove judges once appointed by him without impeachment process per Article 124.\n |\n| An individual heads the autonomous institution of President. | Judiciary/supreme court is also an autonomous institution represented by a team of supreme court judges with chief justice as its chief.\n |\n| President being head of parliament, Executive and supreme commander of the armed forces, is fully empowered by the constitution to fulfil their judicial responsibility.

The institution of President becomes redundant if the president is confined to other ceremonial duties only. | Can intervene or nullify the unlawful actions of union/state governments and unconstitutional laws enacted by the parliament or a state legislative after presidential assent only.\n |\n| President has constitutional immunity for their unconstitutional, *mala fides* activities during their tenure but is liable for judicial action/punishment for their unconstitutional activity after the term of their presidency.

They are the foremost defender of the constitution who can pre-empt the unconstitutional activities of executive and legislatures. | Prime minister/Union cabinet shall aid and advise the president who shall, in the exercise of their functions, act in accordance with such advice as long as not unconstitutional. The prime minister shall communicate to the president all decisions of the Council of Ministers relating to the administration of the affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation and on President's desire submit related information.

Refer page Article 74#Court cases for more clarity | The union cabinet may escape from the punishment or responsibility for implementing unconstitutional laws citing Article 74 (2).\n |\n| President cannot be recalled by the people of India for not fulfilling their constitutional duties in case parliament is not impeaching the president or removed by the supreme court or resigns on their own on moral grounds | Prime minister/ union cabinet cannot be recalled by the people of India till the end of their term in case they lose majority support in Lok Shaba or resigns on their own on moral grounds.\n |\n\n\n## Important presidential interventions in the past[edit]\n\n\nThe president's role as defender of the constitution and the powers as Head of State, especially in relation to those exercised by the prime minister as leader of the government, have changed over time. In particular, Presidents have made a number of interventions into government and lawmaking, which have established and challenged some conventions concerning presidential intervention.\n\n\n\n### Proving majority in the parliament[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vote of confidence\n\nIn 1979, Prime Minister Charan Singh, did not enjoy a parliamentary majority. He responded to this by simply not advising the president to summon parliament.[21] Since then, presidents have been more diligent in directing incoming Prime Ministers to convene parliament and prove their majority within reasonable deadlines (2 to 3 weeks). In the interim period, the Prime Ministers are generally restrained from making policy decisions.\n\n\n\n### Proof of Majority to form a Government[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1990s, Parliamentary elections have generally not resulted in a single party or group of parties having a distinct majority, until the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when BJP received a clear majority. In such cases, presidents have used their discretion and directed Prime Ministerial aspirants to establish their credentials before being invited to form the government. Typically, the aspirants have been asked to produce letters from various party leaders, with the signatures of all the MPs who are pledging support to their candidature. This is in addition to the requirement that a prime minister proves he has the support of the Lok Sabha (by a vote on the floor of the house) within weeks of being sworn into office.[62][63]\n\n\n\n### Vetoing of a Bill[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pocket veto and Zail Singh\n\nSince the Indian constitution does not provide any time limit within which the president is to declare their assent or refusal, the president could exercise a \"pocket veto\" by not taking any action for an indefinite time. The veto was used in 1986 by President Zail Singh over the Postal Bill. The president did not give assent to the bill, arguing that its scope was too sweeping and would give the government arbitrary powers to intercept postal communications indiscriminately.[58][64][65]\n\n\n\n### Rashtrapati Bhavan Communiqu\u00e9s[edit]\n\n\nIn the late 1990s, President K. R. Narayanan introduced a modicum of transparency and openness in the functioning of the President. This was by means of Rashtrapati Bhavan Communiqu\u00e9s explaining, to the nation, the thinking that led to the various decisions he took while exercising their discretionary powers.[66]\n\n\n\n### Return of a Bill[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Office of profit\n\nThe constitution gives the president the power to return a bill unsigned but it circumscribes the power to send it back only once for reconsideration. If the parliament sends back the bill with or without changes, the president is obliged to sign it. In mid-2006, President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam sent back a controversial bill regarding the exclusion of certain offices from the scope of 'offices of profit', the holding of which would disqualify a person from being a member of parliament.[67] The combined opposition, the NDA, hailed the move. The UPA chose to send the bill back to the president without any changes and, after 17 days, Kalam gave his assent on 18 August 2006.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Sacking state governors[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Governors of states of India\n\nArunachal Pradesh governor Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa, who was earlier appointed by the ruling party at the centre, was sacked by President Pranab Mukherjee after the Supreme Court struck down his unconstitutional acts.[70]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of presidents of India\n* Spouse of the President of India\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The president is the head of the executive as per Article 53 and 77 of the Indian Constitution. But in practice, it is the Council of Ministers with the prime minister as its head, that exercises the powers accorded to this position as per Article 74 and 78 of the Indian Constitution. Thus making the prime minister the *de facto* head of the executive.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"President Approves New Protocol Practice\". *pib.gov.in*.

The president leads the executive branch of the Indonesian government and is the commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces. Since 2004, the president and vice president are directly elected to a five-year term, once renewable, allowing for a maximum of 10 years in office.\n\n\nJoko Widodo is the seventh and current president of Indonesia. He assumed office on 20 October 2014.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Sukarno era[edit]\n\n\nThe Indonesian presidency was established during the formulation of the 1945 Constitution by the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK). The office was first filled on 18 August 1945 when Sukarno was elected by acclamation by the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) because according to the Transitional Provisions of the, \"the President and the Vice President for the first time shall be elected by the PPKI.\" Also, the body responsible for the presidential elections, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), had not yet been formed.[3]:\u200a138 On 16 October 1945, Vice President Mohammad Hatta announced a vice-presidential decree which gave the Central National Committee of Indonesia (KNIP) legislative powers.[3]:\u200a152 On 11 November 1945, the KNIP made the decision to separate the role of Head of State from that of Head of Government. Although a new constitution had not been set up yet, Indonesia was now a de facto parliamentary democracy with the president as a ceremonial Head of State whose function was to ask the prime minister as the Head of the Government to form a new Cabinet.\n\n\nDuring the Indonesian National Revolution, both Sukarno and Hatta were captured by the Dutch in Yogyakarta on 18 December 1948. Sukarno then gave a mandate for Sjafruddin Prawiranegara to form an emergency government.[4] This was done and the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI) was formed in Sumatra with Prawiranegara as its chairman. Prawiranegara handed back his mandate to Sukarno on 13 July 1949.[5] On 17 December 1949, Sukarno was elected president of the Republic of the United States of Indonesia (RIS) and presidential mandate passed to Assaat.[6] When it became clear that RIS was going to be replaced by a unitary state, Asaat stepped down from the presidency and Sukarno once again became president on 15 August 1950.\n\n\nIndonesia now adopted the constitution that had been intended for RIS. Officially known as the Provisional Constitution, the document confirmed the president's role as the head of state, but limited him to a mostly ceremonial role. He appointed a prime minister on the advice of formateurs.[7]\n\n\nDespite his limited constitutional role, Sukarno commanded great moral authority. Nonetheless, he was never content with the role of ceremonial head of State, and grew increasingly disenchanted with western-style parliamentary democracy. In the early 1950s, he began calling for the implementation of \"Guided Democracy,\" in which decisions would be made after lengthy deliberation with a view toward achieving a consensus under presidential \"guidance.\"\n\n\nThe rest of the decade saw a series of unstable governments. Taking advantage of the situation, Sukarno made a speech in April 1959 and suggested that Indonesia return to the 1945 Constitution.[8] The People reacted enthusiastically and there was strong pressure on the Constitutional Assembly, the body responsible for formulating a new constitution, to adopt the 1945 Constitution. When the assembly did not budge, Sukarno issued a presidential decree on 5 July 1959 declaring that Indonesia was returning to the 1945 Constitution.[8] That document made the president head of government as well as head of state. In May 1963, the People's Consultative Assembly appointed Sukarno president for Life.[9]\n\n\nAlthough Indonesia had re-adopted the 1945 Constitution, it did not mean that it was strictly adhered to. The MPR, which at this stage was still on a provisional basis (MPRS), was subservient to the president despite its status of the Nation's highest Governing Body. It was only in 1966, when the political tide began to turn against Sukarno that the MPRS nominally regained its rightful constitutional status. In 1967, Sukarno was forced to resign as president, and army chief of staff Suharto was appointed as acting president.\n\n\n\n### Suharto era[edit]\n\n\nSuharto was appointed president in his own right in 1968. During his rise to power, Suharto seemed determined to observe at least the forms of the constitution, and this continued when he became president. Under the constitution, the MPR was responsible for formulating the Outlines of State Policy (GBHN); as president, Suharto was responsible for implementing them. Suharto also made it a presidential obligation to deliver accountability speeches near the end of his terms. During the speech, Suharto outlined the achievements that his administration had made and how those achievements had adhered to the GBHN set by the MPR. Despite the constitutional and democratic fa\u00e7ade, Suharto made sure that the MPR was subservient to him. In 1969, a law was passed that required appointments to the MPR to be made official by the president.[10] He also took measures that largely emasculated the opposition parties. For example, he had the power to issue governmental regulations in lieu of law. Nominally, if these regulations were not approved by the House of People's Representatives (DPR, the pre-2004 legislative branch), they were considered revoked. However, given the DPR's infrequent sessions and the near-total dominance of the pro-government political grouping, Golkar, such approval was a mere formality. Thus, for all intents and purposes, Suharto ruled by decree for most of his tenure. For the better part of Suharto's rule, he effectively held all governing power in the nation.\n\n\n\n### Reform era[edit]\n\n\nSuharto fell from power in May 1998 and the presidency experienced changes as a result of the reform movement. Compared to Suharto, who had all of his accountability speeches accepted, B. J. Habibie had his only accountability speech rejected.[11] Abdurrahman Wahid then became the first president who had to beat another candidate to be elected, as Sukarno and Suharto had been sole candidates. As a result of this, Wahid was also the first president to be elected through counting votes instead of by acclamation. However, Wahid was impeached and removed from office by the MPR. This was a clear sign that while the presidency is the key institution, the MPR was now truly a check on the president's power. Wahid was replaced by his vice president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of Sukarno and former opposition leader during Suharto's presidency. Megawati is the first and, so far, only female ever to become President of Indonesia.[12]\n\n\nDuring the 2001 MPR Annual Session, it was finally decided that from 2004 onwards, the president will directly be elected by the people.[13] In response to Sukarno and Suharto's abuses of power, other amendments passed at that session hedged the presidency about with numerous checks and balances to prevent another president from completely dominating the system. For example, the president was limited to two terms, whether successive or separated. He also lost the right to legislate, but could propose legislation.\n\n\nIn 2004 election, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono became Indonesia's first directly elected president, beating incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri in the runoff election. He was re-elected in 2009. In 2014, Yudhoyono finished his second presidential term and was barred from seeking re-election.\n\n\nThe 3rd Indonesian presidential election was held on 9 July 2014 and matched former general and Suharto's ex-son in law Prabowo Subianto against the governor of Jakarta, Joko Widodo. On 22 July the General Elections Commission announced Joko Widodo's victory. He and his vice president, Jusuf Kalla, were sworn in on 20 October 2014, for a 5-year term.\n\n\n\n## Requirements to run for office[edit]\n\n\n**The Amended 1945 Constitution**: The presidential candidate has to be an Indonesian citizen since their birth, who has not willingly become a citizen in another nation, has not betrayed the nation, and is physically and mentally capable of performing the duties. Amended Constitution also states that further criteria will be determined by laws. The president is also required to be nominated by a Political Party or a coalition of Political Parties.\n\n\n**2017 Law No. 7 Regarding Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections**  \nThe presidential candidate must:\n\n\n\n* Mindful of God;[14]\n* have been an Indonesian citizen since their birth, who has not willingly become a citizen of another nation;\n* spouse, if any, holds Indonesian citizenship;\n* have not betrayed the nation, and has not been involved in any corruption or other serious criminal offense;\n* be physically and mentally capable of performing the duties as well as free from any drug abuse;\n* be a permanent resident in the territory of the Republic of Indonesia;\n* have reported their wealth to the Corruption Eradication Commission;\n* have no debt individually or collectively that can create a loss for the state;\n* have not been declared bankrupt by a court decision;\n* never been involved in any despicable act;\n* not concurrently running as a candidate for member of the legislature;\n* be registered as a voter;\n* be registered as a tax payer and have paid taxes for at least the last five years;\n* have never previously served as president for two terms;\n* faithful to Pancasila, the 1945 Constitution, the Republic of Indonesia, and *Bhinneka Tunggal Ika*;\n* have never been sentenced to jail for five years or more;\n* not be less than 40 years of age;\n* have graduated at least from the senior high school or its equivalent;\n* not a former member of the Communist Party of Indonesia, including its mass organizations, or not directly involved in the 30 September Movement;\n* have a vision, mission, and program in running the government.\n\n\nThis law also stipulates that only political parties or a coalition of political parties that obtained 20% of the seats in the DPR or 25% of the total valid votes in the previous election may nominate president and vice president candidate.\n\n\n**The Original 1945 Constitution**: The presidential candidate has to be of Indonesian origin.\n\n\n**The 1950 Provisional Constitution**: The presidential candidate has to be an Indonesian citizen aged at least 30 years old.

If the vice president becomes vacant, the president nominates two candidates and the MPR has to elect a new vice president out of the candidates within 60 days. If the president and the vice president dies, resigns, or are unable to perform their duties for any reason, the government will be taken over together by the minister of home affairs, minister of foreign affairs, and minister of defense. No later than 30 days after that, MPR must elect a new president and vice president from the two candidates nominated by the political party or coalition of political parties whose candidates were the winner and the runner-up in the previous presidential election.[16]\n\n\nUnder the amended constitution, the president (also vice president) can now be impeached and removed from office. If the president is viewed to have violated the law in the form of treason against the state, corruption, bribery, other serious crimes, or disgraceful acts, and/or no longer meets the requirements to be president, the DPR can ask the Constitutional Court to look into the matter, during which it has 90 days to make a decision. The DPR's request to the Constitutional Court can only be made with the support of 2/3 of the total number of DPR members who are present at the session which is attended by at least 2/3 of the DPR's members (At least 44.44% of the total members of the DPR). If the Constitutional Court decides that the president has violated the law, the DPR can motion for the MPR to convene. The president would then be given one last chance to defend himself before the MPR makes the decision whether or not the president should be impeached. The decision of the MPR to dismiss the President and/or the Vice President is made with the approval of at least 2/3 of the members of the MPR who are present at the session which is attended by at least 3/4 of all members of the MPR (at least 50% of the total members of the MPR).\n\n\n**The Original 1945 Constitution**: If the president dies, resigns, or is unable to perform their duties for any reason, they are replaced by the vice president.\n\n\n**The 1950 Provisional Constitution**: If the president dies, resigns, or is unable to perform their duties for any reason, they are replaced by the vice president.\n\n\nAlthough there is no article about president (and vice president) impeachment in the original 1945 Constitution, Sukarno and Abdurrahman Wahid were still impeached in 1967 and 2001. Article on the impeachment of the president and vice president were made after the impeachment of Abdurrahman Wahid in the 3rd amendment to the Constitution.\n\n\n\n## Post-presidency and decorations[edit]\n\n\n### Post-presidency rights[edit]\n\n\nLaw No.7 of 1978[17] stipulates that former presidents are entitled to a pension. Former presidents are also entitled to a house, with electricity, water, and telephone bills covered by the government. In addition to that, former presidents shall have free healthcare for their families and a car with a chauffeur.\n\n\n\n### Decorations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Third president B. J.

The president is the nominal head of the executive and the supreme commander of the Pakistan Armed Forces.[4][5] Arif Alvi is the 13th and current president, in office since 9 September 2018.\n\n\nThe office of president was created upon the proclamation of Islamic Republic on 23 March 1956. The then serving governor-general, Major-General Iskander Mirza, assumed office as the first president. Following the 1958 *coup d'etat*, the office of prime minister was abolished, leaving the Presidency as the most powerful office in the country. This position was further strengthened when the 1962 Constitution was adopted. It turned Pakistan into a Presidential Republic, giving all executive powers to the president. In 1973, the new Constitution established Parliamentary democracy and reduced the president's role to a ceremonial one. Nevertheless, the military takeover in 1977 reversed the changes. The 8th Amendment turned Pakistan into a semi-presidential republic and in the period between 1985 and 2010, the executive power was shared by the president and prime minister. The 18th Amendment in 2010 restored Parliamentary Democracy in the country, and reduced the presidency to a ceremonial position.[6]\n\n\nThe constitution prohibits the president from directly running the government.[7] Instead, the executive power is exercised on his behalf by the prime minister who keeps him informed on all matters of internal and foreign policy, as well as all legislative proposals.[8] The Constitution however, vests the president with the powers of granting pardons, reprieves, and the control over military; however, all appointments at higher commands of the military must be made by the President on a \"required and necessary\" basis, upon consultation and approval from the prime minister.[9]\n\n\nThe president is indirectly elected by the Electoral College for a five-year term. The Constitution requires the president to be a \"Muslim of not less than forty five (45) years of age\". The president resides in an estate in Islamabad known as Aiwan-e-Sadar (President's House). In his absence, the chairman of Senate exercises the responsibilities of the post, until the actual president resumes office, or the next office holder is elected.\n\n\nThere have been a total of 13 presidents. The first president was Iskander Ali Mirza who entered office on 23 March 1956. The current office holder is Dr Arif Alvi, who took charge on 9 September 2018, following his victory in the 2018 elections.\n\n\n\n\n## Powers and authority[edit]\n\n\n### Role of the president[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Ceremonial guard of honour at the *Aiwan-e-Sadr*.\nThe official residence and principal workplace of the president is Aiwan-e-Sadr\u2014 the presidential palace located in northeastern Islamabad.

The president can be removed for violation of the Constitution of Pakistan.[31]\n\n\nThe impeachment process may start in either of the two houses of the Parliament. The house initiates the process by leveling the charges against the president.[32] The charges are contained in a notice that has to be signed by either the chairman or the speaker of the National Assembly through a two-thirds majority.[32] The notice is sent up to the president, and 14 days later it is taken up for consideration.[33]\n\n\nA resolution to impeach the president has to be passed by the two-thirds majority.[34] The speaker of the National Assembly then summons the joint session not earlier than seven days.[35] The president has the right to defend oneself.[36]\n\n\nIf the resolution is passed by the two-thirds majority at the joint session declaring that the president is unfit to hold the office due to incapacity or is guilty of violating the Constitution or of gross misconduct, then the president shall cease to hold office immediately on the passing of the resolution.[37]\n\n\nNo president has been impeached. However, the proceedings have been used in 2008 in an attempt to impeach former president Pervez Musharraf who tendered the resignation after the proceedings above were used.[38]\n\n\n\n## List of presidents[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of presidents of Pakistan and List of heads of state of Pakistan\n\n## Political background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Presidential standard (1956\u20131967)\n### Early origins[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1947 until 1956, the governor-general of Pakistan acted for the head of state: King George VI (until 1952) and Queen Elizabeth II (from 1952). With the promulgation of the first constitution, Pakistan became an Islamic republic in 1956, and the governor-general was replaced with the presidency. The incumbent governor-general, Iskander Mirza, became Pakistan's first president. He reportedly suspended the first constitution in 1958, and appointed Army commander-in-chief General Ayub Khan as the first chief martial law administrator. Khan subsequently dismissed Mirza in order to become the president.\n\n\n\n![](image)Iskander Mirza became the 1st President of Pakistan in 1956\nThe second constitution introduced by President Ayub Khan turned the country into a presidential republic without direct elections. Succumbing to internal and international pressure, however, Khan held a nationwide presidential election in 1965. Khan successfully campaigned against his opponent, Fatima Jinnah, for a second term, but some have alleged that elections were rigged in favour of Ayub Khan.\n\n\n\n![](image)Presidential standard (1974\u20131998)\nControversy regarding the U-2 incident (1960), privatization (1963), and war with India (1965), fueled a fierce left-wing opposition movement led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of the PPP and Bengali nationalist Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who, with the support of demonstrators, aimed to further weaken the presidency. Suffering from paralysis and declining health, Ayub Khan handed over the presidency to army chief General Yahya Khan, who imposed martial law and announced that national elections would be held in 1970. Eventually, general elections were held in 1970 which saw the PPP gaining a majority of seats in West Pakistan (current-day Pakistan) and the Awami League gaining a majority in East Pakistan (current-day Bangladesh).\n\n\nAfter he was unable to reach a compromise between the PPP and the Awami League, President Yahya Khan invited Nurul Amin of the Pakistan Muslim League to become the prime minister, and also appointed him as the first vice president. The growing instigated violence against Pakistanis in East Pakistan forced President Yahya Khan to use force in order to maintain order there, which further escalated Bengali resistance (1970). Preemptive strikes against India led to another war in 1971, which freed East Pakistan and created Bangladesh.\n\n\nTaking personal responsibility for the political isolation and devastation of Pakistan after the fall of East Pakistan, President Yahya Khan stepped down and ceded power to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. President Bhutto created the current Constitution of Pakistan in 1973, transforming Pakistan into a parliamentary democracy, and reducing presidential powers to that of a ceremonial figurehead.\n\n\n\n### Past Interventions[edit]\n\n\nThe general elections held in 1977 resulted in an atmosphere of civil unrest instigated by the right-wing alliance, the Pakistan National Alliance. The events leading to it resulted in military intervention by chief of army staff General Zia-ul-Haq and Chairman Joint Chiefs Admiral Mohammad Shariff. Suspending the Constitution in 1977, General Zia-ul-Haq took over the presidency in 1978. Zia's presidency oversaw the modern growth of far-right ideas in the country. Succumbing to domestic pressure to restore the Constitution, President Zia-ul-Haq held a referendum (1984) and called for general elections in 1985. President Zia-ul-Haq appointed Mohammad Junejo as prime minister and assumed more powers through the constitutional amendment. After dismissing Prime Minister Junejo, President Zia-ul-Haq announced that new general elections would be held, but President Zia died in a plane crash in 1988.\n\n\nThe general elections held in 1988 witnessed the victory of PPP in 1988 and appointed Senate chairman Ghulam Ishaq Khan to the presidency. The conflict between Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan arose in two areas regarding the issues of appointments. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan repeatedly intervened in government matters and leveled charges against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto; thus dismissing Prime Minister Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1990. After holding general elections in 1990, Nawaz Sharif brought up an ideologically conservative government and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan unsuccessfully tried to dismiss Sharif. After a successful intervention by Supreme Court and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Shamim Allam, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tendered resignations in 1993.\n\n\nFollowing the new elections held in 1993, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto established a strong government after appointing loyalist Farooq Leghari to the presidency. However, the corruption charges and the controversial death of Murtaza Bhutto in 1996 resulted in President Farooq Leghari dismissing Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. In 1997, President Farooq Leghari could not overcome the heavy mandate bestowed on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by the public in 1997. President Leghari unsuccessfully supported Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah\u2014 both of them resigned, ending the conflict between the Judiciary, the Executive, and the Parliament. After appointing Rafiq Tarar, the Parliament successfully passed constitutional amendment to decisively limit the presidency. After staging a controversial self coup in 1999, General Pervez Musharraf dismissed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Rafiq Tarar in 2001 while assuming more powers to the presidency. In January 2004, the Electoral College elected Musharraf, and as a result he was, according to the Constitution, \"deemed to be elected\".[39]\n\n\nPresident Musharraf's repeated unconstitutional intervention resulted in a standoff with the Judiciary, and declared a state of emergency in 2007, after dismissing the senior justices of the Supreme Court. Although Musharraf was elected in 2007, the constitutional legality of Musharraf's rule was found dubious. A populist constitutional movement eventually resulted in Musharraf's departure. On 22 August 2008, the electoral commission called for presidential nominations to be delivered by 26 August 2008 and for elections to be held on 6 September 2008.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### Figurehead overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Arif Alvi visits Maritime Ministry, flanked by Ali Zaidi and Rizwan Ahmed\nAfter the presidential election held in 2008, Asif Ali Zardari lobbied for constitutional amendment to restore the Constitution as it was in 1973.[42][43][44][45] In 2010, the Parliament unanimously and with a large majority, passed the eighteenth amendment of the constitution. It revoked the presidential powers and changed Pakistan from a semi-presidential system of government to a parliamentary republic, with great hopes of governmental stability in the future.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Principal Secretary to the President of Pakistan\n* Air transports of heads of state and government\n* Official state car\n* Prime Minister of Pakistan\n* Chief Justice of Pakistan\n* Chief Justice of the Federal Shariat Court\n* Chief of Army Staff of the Pakistan Army\n* Constitution of Pakistan\n* Foreign Minister of Pakistan\n* Finance Minister of Pakistan\n* Interior Minister of Pakistan\n* Minister of Defence (Pakistan)\n* Vice President of Pakistan\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Gupta, K.
