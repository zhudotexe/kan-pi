Being the largest province-level division of China by area and the 8th-largest country subdivision in the world, Xinjiang spans over 1.6 million square kilometres (620,000 sq mi) and has about 25 million inhabitants.[1][12] Xinjiang borders the countries of Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. The rugged Karakoram, Kunlun and Tian Shan mountain ranges occupy much of Xinjiang's borders, as well as its western and southern regions. The Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract regions, both administered by China, are claimed by India. Xinjiang also borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Major ethnic groups in Xinjiang by region (2018 data)[I]P = Prefecture; AP = Autonomous prefecture; PLC = Prefecture-level city; DACLC = Directly administered county-level city.[236] |\n| --- |\n|  | Uyghurs (%) | Han (%) | Kazakhs (%) | others (%) |\n| **Xinjiang** | **51.14** | **34.41** | **6.90** | **7.55** |\n| Ürümqi PLC | 12.85 | **71.21** | 2.77 | 13.16\n |\n| Karamay PLC | 15.59 | **74.67** | 4.05 | 5.69\n |\n| Turpan Prefecture | **76.96** | 16.84 | 0.05 | 6.15\n |\n| Kumul Prefecture | 20.01 | **65.49** | 10.04 | 4.46\n |\n| Changji AP | 4.89 | **72.28** | 10.34 | 12.49\n |\n| Bortala AP | 14.76 | **63.27** | 10.41 | 11.56\n |\n| Bayin'gholin AP | 36.38 | **53.31** | 0.11 | 10.20\n |\n| Aksu Prefecture | **80.08** | 18.56 | 0.01 | 1.36\n |\n| Kizilsu AP | **66.24** | 6.29 | 0.03 | 27.44\n |\n| Kashgar Prefecture | **92.56** | 6.01 | < 0.005 | 1.42\n |\n| Khotan Prefecture | **96.96** | 2.85 | < 0.005 | 0.19\n |\n| Ili AP[n 3] | 17.95 | 40.09 | 27.16 | 14.80\n |\n| – *former Ili Prefecture* | 26.30 | 35.21 | 21.57 | 16.91\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n132. **^** Ministry of Civil Affairs. 2014年12月中华人民共和国县以上行政区划代码 [Administrative code of the county or above in the People's Republic of China in December 2014] (in Simplified Chinese).

Religiously, the most Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow Islam; in the rest of China, many are Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian, although many follow Islam as well, such as the Hui ethnic subgroup of the Han ethnicity, comprising some 10 million people. Thus, the major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity and religious doctrinal differences that differentiate them politically from other Muslim minorities elsewhere in the country.[161]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Development of GDP\n |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | GDP in billions of Yuan\n |\n| 1995\n | 82\n |\n| 2000\n | 136\n |\n| 2005\n | 260\n |\n| 2010\n | 544\n |\n| 2015\n | 932\n |\n| 2020\n | 1,380\n |\n| Source:[163] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n☐ **Disputed areas claimed by Indiaand administered by China(see Sino-Indian border dispute)**\n |\n| Division code[132] | Division\n | Area in km2[133] | Population 2020 (XPCC data from 2010)[134][135] | Seat\n | Divisions[136] |\n| Districts | Counties | Aut. counties | CL cities |\n| 650000 | Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\n | 1,664,900.00 | 25,852,345 | Ürümqi city | 13 | 61 | 6 | 27\n |\n| 650100 | Ürümqi city\n | 13,787.90 | 4,054,369 | Tianshan District | 7 | 1 |  |  |\n| 650200 | Karamay city\n | 8,654.08 | 490,348 | Karamay District | 4 |  |  |  |\n| 650400 | Turpan city\n | 67,562.91 | 693,988 | Gaochang District | 1 | 2 |  |  |\n| 650500 | Hami city\n | 142,094.88 | 673,383 | Yizhou District | 1 |  | 1 | 1\n |\n| 652300 | Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture | 73,139.75 | 1,613,585 | Changji city |  | 4 | 1 | 2\n |\n| 652700 | Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture | 24,934.33 | 488,198 | Bole city |  | 2 |  | 2\n |\n| 652800 | Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture | 470,954.25 | 1,613,979 | Korla city |  | 7 | 1 | 1\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| – *Tacheng Prefecture* | 4.25 | **54.66** | 26.66 | 14.43\n |\n| – *Altay Prefecture* | 1.42 | 39.85 | **52.76** | 5.97\n |\n| Shihezi DACLC | 1.09 | **94.13** | 0.63 | 4.15\n |\n| Aral DACLC | 3.66 | **91.96** | < 0.005 | 4.38\n |\n| Tumushuke DACLC | **67.49** | 31.73 | < 0.005 | 0.78\n |\n| Wujiaqu DACLC | 0.05 | **96.29** | 0.10 | 3.55\n |\n| Tiemenguan DACLC | 0.07 | **95.96** | 0.00 | 3.97\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Does not include members of the People's Liberation Army in active service.\n\n### Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 2,003.00 | 174,465 | *Jinxiu Subdistrict* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659004 | Wujiaqu city   (6th Division)\n | 742.00 | 90,205 | *Renmin Road Subdistrict* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659005 | Beitun city   (10th Division)\n | 910.50 | 86,300 | *Beitun Town* (Altay) |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659006 | Tiemenguan city   (2nd Division)\n | 590.27 | 50,000 | Xingjiang Road, 29th Regiment |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659007 | Shuanghe city   (5th Division)\n | 742.18 | 53,800 | Hongxing No.2 Road, 89th Regiment |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659008 | Kokdala city   (4th Division)\n | 979.71 | 75,000 | Xinfu Road, 66th Regiment |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659009 | Kunyu city   (14th Division)\n | 687.13 | 45,200 | *Yuyuan Town* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659010 | Huyanghe city   (7th Division)\n | 677.94 | 80,000 | *Gongqing town* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659011 | Xinxing city   (13rd Division)\n |  |  | *Huangtian Town* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659012 | Baiyang city   (9th Division)\n |  |  | *163rd Regiment of the 9th Division* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| Sub-provincial prefecture\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Population by urban areas of prefecture & county cities\n |\n| --- |\n| #

Xinjiang borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and India's Leh district in Ladakh to the south, Qinghai and Gansu provinces to the east, Mongolia (Bayan-Ölgii, Govi-Altai and Khovd Provinces) to the east, Russia's Altai Republic to the north and Kazakhstan (Almaty and East Kazakhstan Regions), Kyrgyzstan (Issyk-Kul, Naryn and Osh Regions), Tajikistan's Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, Afghanistan's Badakhshan Province and Pakistan's Gilgit-Baltistan to the west.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n136. **^** Ministry of Civil Affairs (August 2014). 中国民政统计年鉴2014 [*China Civil Affairs Statistics Yearbook 2014*] (in Simplified Chinese).

The territory came under the rule of the Qing dynasty in the 18th century, which was later replaced by the Republic of China. Since 1949 and the Chinese Civil War, it has been part of the People's Republic of China. In 1954, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) established the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) to strengthen border defense against the Soviet Union and promote the local economy by settling soldiers into the region.[20] In 1955, Xinjiang was administratively changed from a province into an autonomous region. In recent decades, abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in Xinjiang and it is currently China's largest natural-gas-producing region.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTarim basin is the largest oil and gas bearing area in the country with about 16 billion tonnes of oil and gas reserves discovered.[188] The area is still actively explored and in 2021, China National Petroleum Corporation found a new oil field reserve of 1 billion tons (about 907 million tonnes). That find is regarded as being the largest one in recent decades. As of 2021, the basin produces hydrocarbons at an annual rate of 2 million tons, up from 1.52 million tons from 2020.[189]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Dabei gas field and Dina-2 gas field\n\n### Foreign trade[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2000, Uyghurs were 45 percent of Xinjiang's population and 13 percent of Ürümqi's population. With nine percent of Xinjiang's population, Ürümqi accounts for 25 percent of the region's GDP; many rural Uyghurs have migrated to the city for work in its light, heavy and petrochemical industries.[100] Han in Xinjiang are older, better-educated and work in higher-paying professions than their Uyghur counterparts. Han are more likely to cite business reasons for moving to Ürümqi, while some Uyghurs cite legal trouble at home and family reasons for moving to the city.[101] Han and Uyghurs are equally represented in Ürümqi's floating population, which works primarily in commerce. Auto-segregation in the city is widespread in residential concentration, employment relationships and endogamy.[102] In 2010, Uyghurs were a majority in the Tarim Basin and a plurality in Xinjiang as a whole.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 12 | Hotan | 119,804 | 322,300 | *part of Hotan Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 13 | Altay | 112,711 | 190,064 | *part of Altay Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 14 | Turpan[ii] | 89,719 | 273,385 | 622,903 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 15 | Tacheng | 75,122 | 161,037 | *part of Tacheng Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 16 | Wujiaqu | 75,088 | 96,436 | 96,436 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 17 | Fukang | 67,598 | 165,006 | *part of Changji Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 18 | Aral | 65,175 | 158,593 | 158,593 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 19 | Artux | 58,427 | 240,368 | *part of Kizilsu Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Beitun[iii] | 57,889 | 57,889 | 57,889 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Kokdala[iv] | 57,537 | 57,537 | 57,537 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Shuanghe[v] | 53,565 | 53,565 | 53,565 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Korgas[vi] | 51,462 | 51,462 | *part of Ili Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Kunyu[vii] | 36,399 | 36,399 | 36,399 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 20 | Tumxuk | 34,808 | 135,727 | 135,727 | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Human Development Indices (5.0)- China\".

China's first border free trade zone (Horgos Free Trade Zone) was located at the Xinjiang-Kazakhstan border city of Horgos.[191] Horgos is the largest \"land port\" in China's western region and it has easy access to the Central Asian market.

Uyghur independence activists express concern over the Han population changing the Uyghur character of the region though the Han and Hui Chinese mostly live in Northern Xinjiang Dzungaria and are separated from areas of historic Uyghur dominance south of the Tian Shan mountains (Southwestern Xinjiang), where Uyghurs account for about 90 percent of the population.[234]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Gao, Erqiang (高尔锵) (1996). 塔吉克汉词典 [*Tajik-Chinese Dictionary*] (in Simplified Chinese).

While the Hui rebels were preparing to attack Gansu and Shaanxi, Yaqub Beg (an Uzbek or Tajik commander of the Kokand Khanate) fled from the khanate in 1865 after losing Tashkent to the Russians. Beg settled in Kashgar, and soon controlled Xinjiang. Although he encouraged trade, built caravansareis, canals and other irrigation systems, his regime was considered harsh.

Thus, the major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity and religious doctrinal differences that differentiate them politically from other Muslim minorities elsewhere in the country.[161]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Development of GDP\n |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | GDP in billions of Yuan\n |\n| 1995\n | 82\n |\n| 2000\n | 136\n |\n| 2005\n | 260\n |\n| 2010\n | 544\n |\n| 2015\n | 932\n |\n| 2020\n | 1,380\n |\n| Source:[163] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n☐ **Disputed areas claimed by Indiaand administered by China(see Sino-Indian border dispute)**\n |\n| Division code[132] | Division\n | Area in km2[133] | Population 2020 (XPCC data from 2010)[134][135] | Seat\n | Divisions[136] |\n| Districts | Counties | Aut. counties | CL cities |\n| 650000 | Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\n | 1,664,900.00 | 25,852,345 | Ürümqi city | 13 | 61 | 6 | 27\n |\n| 650100 | Ürümqi city\n | 13,787.90 | 4,054,369 | Tianshan District | 7 | 1 |  |  |\n| 650200 | Karamay city\n | 8,654.08 | 490,348 | Karamay District | 4 |  |  |  |\n| 650400 | Turpan city\n | 67,562.91 | 693,988 | Gaochang District | 1 | 2 |  |  |\n| 650500 | Hami city\n | 142,094.88 | 673,383 | Yizhou District | 1 |  | 1 | 1\n |\n| 652300 | Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture | 73,139.75 | 1,613,585 | Changji city |  | 4 | 1 | 2\n |\n| 652700 | Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture | 24,934.33 | 488,198 | Bole city |  | 2 |  | 2\n |\n| 652800 | Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture | 470,954.25 | 1,613,979 | Korla city |  | 7 | 1 | 1\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| – *Tacheng Prefecture* | 4.25 | **54.66** | 26.66 | 14.43\n |\n| – *Altay Prefecture* | 1.42 | 39.85 | **52.76** | 5.97\n |\n| Shihezi DACLC | 1.09 | **94.13** | 0.63 | 4.15\n |\n| Aral DACLC | 3.66 | **91.96** | < 0.005 | 4.38\n |\n| Tumushuke DACLC | **67.49** | 31.73 | < 0.005 | 0.78\n |\n| Wujiaqu DACLC | 0.05 | **96.29** | 0.10 | 3.55\n |\n| Tiemenguan DACLC | 0.07 | **95.96** | 0.00 | 3.97\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Does not include members of the People's Liberation Army in active service.\n\n### Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 2,003.00 | 174,465 | *Jinxiu Subdistrict* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659004 | Wujiaqu city   (6th Division)\n | 742.00 | 90,205 | *Renmin Road Subdistrict* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659005 | Beitun city   (10th Division)\n | 910.50 | 86,300 | *Beitun Town* (Altay) |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659006 | Tiemenguan city   (2nd Division)\n | 590.27 | 50,000 | Xingjiang Road, 29th Regiment |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659007 | Shuanghe city   (5th Division)\n | 742.18 | 53,800 | Hongxing No.2 Road, 89th Regiment |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659008 | Kokdala city   (4th Division)\n | 979.71 | 75,000 | Xinfu Road, 66th Regiment |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659009 | Kunyu city   (14th Division)\n | 687.13 | 45,200 | *Yuyuan Town* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659010 | Huyanghe city   (7th Division)\n | 677.94 | 80,000 | *Gongqing town* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659011 | Xinxing city   (13rd Division)\n |  |  | *Huangtian Town* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659012 | Baiyang city   (9th Division)\n |  |  | *163rd Regiment of the 9th Division* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| Sub-provincial prefecture\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Population by urban areas of prefecture & county cities\n |\n| --- |\n| #

Xinjiang borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and India's Leh district in Ladakh to the south, Qinghai and Gansu provinces to the east, Mongolia (Bayan-Ölgii, Govi-Altai and Khovd Provinces) to the east, Russia's Altai Republic to the north and Kazakhstan (Almaty and East Kazakhstan Regions), Kyrgyzstan (Issyk-Kul, Naryn and Osh Regions), Tajikistan's Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, Afghanistan's Badakhshan Province and Pakistan's Gilgit-Baltistan to the west.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n136. **^** Ministry of Civil Affairs (August 2014). 中国民政统计年鉴2014 [*China Civil Affairs Statistics Yearbook 2014*] (in Simplified Chinese).

The territory came under the rule of the Qing dynasty in the 18th century, which was later replaced by the Republic of China. Since 1949 and the Chinese Civil War, it has been part of the People's Republic of China. In 1954, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) established the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) to strengthen border defense against the Soviet Union and promote the local economy by settling soldiers into the region.[20] In 1955, Xinjiang was administratively changed from a province into an autonomous region. In recent decades, abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in Xinjiang and it is currently China's largest natural-gas-producing region.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTarim basin is the largest oil and gas bearing area in the country with about 16 billion tonnes of oil and gas reserves discovered.[188] The area is still actively explored and in 2021, China National Petroleum Corporation found a new oil field reserve of 1 billion tons (about 907 million tonnes). That find is regarded as being the largest one in recent decades. As of 2021, the basin produces hydrocarbons at an annual rate of 2 million tons, up from 1.52 million tons from 2020.[189]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Dabei gas field and Dina-2 gas field\n\n### Foreign trade[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2000, Uyghurs were 45 percent of Xinjiang's population and 13 percent of Ürümqi's population. With nine percent of Xinjiang's population, Ürümqi accounts for 25 percent of the region's GDP; many rural Uyghurs have migrated to the city for work in its light, heavy and petrochemical industries.[100] Han in Xinjiang are older, better-educated and work in higher-paying professions than their Uyghur counterparts. Han are more likely to cite business reasons for moving to Ürümqi, while some Uyghurs cite legal trouble at home and family reasons for moving to the city.[101] Han and Uyghurs are equally represented in Ürümqi's floating population, which works primarily in commerce. Auto-segregation in the city is widespread in residential concentration, employment relationships and endogamy.[102] In 2010, Uyghurs were a majority in the Tarim Basin and a plurality in Xinjiang as a whole.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 12 | Hotan | 119,804 | 322,300 | *part of Hotan Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 13 | Altay | 112,711 | 190,064 | *part of Altay Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 14 | Turpan[ii] | 89,719 | 273,385 | 622,903 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 15 | Tacheng | 75,122 | 161,037 | *part of Tacheng Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 16 | Wujiaqu | 75,088 | 96,436 | 96,436 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 17 | Fukang | 67,598 | 165,006 | *part of Changji Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 18 | Aral | 65,175 | 158,593 | 158,593 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 19 | Artux | 58,427 | 240,368 | *part of Kizilsu Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Beitun[iii] | 57,889 | 57,889 | 57,889 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Kokdala[iv] | 57,537 | 57,537 | 57,537 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Shuanghe[v] | 53,565 | 53,565 | 53,565 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Korgas[vi] | 51,462 | 51,462 | *part of Ili Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Kunyu[vii] | 36,399 | 36,399 | 36,399 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 20 | Tumxuk | 34,808 | 135,727 | 135,727 | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Human Development Indices (5.0)- China\".

China's first border free trade zone (Horgos Free Trade Zone) was located at the Xinjiang-Kazakhstan border city of Horgos.[191] Horgos is the largest \"land port\" in China's western region and it has easy access to the Central Asian market.

Uyghur independence activists express concern over the Han population changing the Uyghur character of the region though the Han and Hui Chinese mostly live in Northern Xinjiang Dzungaria and are separated from areas of historic Uyghur dominance south of the Tian Shan mountains (Southwestern Xinjiang), where Uyghurs account for about 90 percent of the population.[234]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Gao, Erqiang (高尔锵) (1996). 塔吉克汉词典 [*Tajik-Chinese Dictionary*] (in Simplified Chinese).

While the Hui rebels were preparing to attack Gansu and Shaanxi, Yaqub Beg (an Uzbek or Tajik commander of the Kokand Khanate) fled from the khanate in 1865 after losing Tashkent to the Russians. Beg settled in Kashgar, and soon controlled Xinjiang. Although he encouraged trade, built caravansareis, canals and other irrigation systems, his regime was considered harsh.

By the end of the 8th century, the empire reached its greatest extent. After a civil war, the empire broke up in 842. The royal lineage fragmented and ruled over small kingdoms such as Guge, Maryul and Nyingma. The Mongol Empire conquered Tibet in 1244 but granted the region a degree of political autonomy. Kublai Khan later incorporated Tibetans into his Yuan empire (1271–1368). The Sakya lama Drogön Chögyal Phagpa became religious teacher to Kublai in the 1250s, and was made the head of the Tibetan region administration c. 1264.\n\n\nFrom 1354 to 1642, Central Tibet (Ü-Tsang) was ruled by a succession of dynasties from Nêdong, Shigatse and Lhasa. In 1642, the Ganden Phodrang court of the 5th Dalai Lama was established by Güshi Khan of the Khoshut Khanate, who was enthroned as King (chogyal) of Tibet. The Khoshuts ruled until 1717, when they were overthrown by the Dzungar Khanate. The Dzungar forces were in turn expelled by the 1720 Manchu  expedition to Tibet during the Dzungar–Qing Wars. This began  Qing rule over Tibet: Tibet came under the direct control of the central Chinese government.[6]\n\n\nDespite some politically-charged historical debate on the exact nature of  Sino-Tibetan relations,[7][8][9] most historians [*who?*] agree that Tibet under the Ganden Phodrang (1642 to c. 1951) was an independent state, albeit the country had been under different foreign suzerainties for much of its history – including during the Ming dynasty period (1368–1644).\n\n\nFrom 1912 to 1950, the State of Tibet became *de facto* independent after the fall of the Qing dynasty, like many other regions of the successor Republic of China. The Republic of China régime, preoccupied with fractious  warlordism (1916–1928),  civil war (1927–1949) and  Japanese invasion (1937–1945), failed to assert its authority in Tibet. Other smaller kingdoms of ethno-cultural Tibet in eastern Kham and Amdo had been under *de jure* administration of the Chinese dynastic government since the mid-18th century;[10] as of 2022[update] they variously form parts of the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan. (See also: Xikang Province)\n\n\nIn 1950, after the 1949 establishment of the People's Republic of China, the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet and defeated the Tibetan local army in a battle fought near the city of Chamdo. In 1951, Tibetan representatives signed a  17-point agreement with the Central People's Government affirming China's sovereignty over Tibet and the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China. The 14th Dalai Lama ratified the agreement in October 1951.[11][12][13] After a failed violent  uprising, the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 and renounced the 17-point agreement. The  establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1965 made Tibet a provincial-level division of China.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Tibet\n\nThe Tibet Autonomous Region is located on the Tibetan Plateau, the highest region on Earth. In northern Tibet elevations reach an average of over 4,572 metres (15,000 ft). Mount Everest is located on Tibet's border with Nepal.\n\n\nChina's provincial-level areas of Xinjiang, Qinghai and Sichuan lie to the north, northeast and east, respectively, of the Tibet AR. There is also a short border with Yunnan Province to the southeast. The countries to the south and southwest are Myanmar, India, Bhutan, and Nepal. China claims Arunachal Pradesh administered by India as part of the Tibet Autonomous Region. It also claims some areas adjoining the Chumbi Valley that are recognised as Bhutan's territory, and some areas of eastern Ladakh claimed by India. India and China agreed to respect the Line of Actual Control in a bilateral agreement signed on 7 September 1993.[14][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mount Everest\nPhysically, the Tibet AR may be divided into two parts: the lakes region in the west and north-west and the river region, which spreads out on three sides of the former on the east, south and west. Both regions receive limited amounts of rainfall as they lie in the rain shadow of the Himalayas; however, the region names are useful in contrasting their hydrological structures, and also in contrasting their different cultural uses: nomadic in the lake region and agricultural in the river region.[15] On the south the Tibet AR is bounded by the Himalayas, and on the north by a broad mountain system. The system at no point narrows to a single range; generally there are three or four across its breadth. As a whole the system forms the watershed between rivers flowing to the Indian Ocean — the Indus, Brahmaputra and Salween and its tributaries — and the streams flowing into the undrained salt lakes to the north.\n\n\nThe lake region extends from the Pangong Tso Lake in Ladakh, Lake Rakshastal, Yamdrok Lake and Lake Manasarovar near the source of the Indus River, to the sources of the Salween, the Mekong and the Yangtze. Other lakes include Dagze Co, Namtso, and Pagsum Co. The lake region is a wind-swept Alpine grassland. This region is called the Chang Tang (Byang sang) or 'Northern Plateau' by the people of Tibet. It is 1,100 km (680 mi) broad and covers an area about equal to that of France. Due to its great distance from the ocean it is extremely arid and possesses no river outlet. The mountain ranges are spread out, rounded, disconnected, and separated by relatively flat valleys.\n\n\nThe Tibet AR is dotted over with large and small lakes, generally salt or alkaline, and intersected by streams. Due to the presence of discontinuous permafrost over the Chang Tang, the soil is boggy and covered with tussocks of grass, thus resembling the Siberian tundra. Salt and fresh-water lakes are intermingled. The lakes are generally without outlet, or have only a small effluent. The deposits consist of soda, potash, borax and common salt. The lake region is noted for a vast number of hot springs, which are widely distributed between the Himalaya and 34° N, but are most numerous to the west of Tengri Nor (north-west of Lhasa). So intense is the cold in this part of Tibet that these springs are sometimes represented by columns of ice, the nearly boiling water having frozen in the act of ejection.\n\n\nThe river region is characterized by fertile mountain valleys and includes the Yarlung Tsangpo River (the upper courses of the Brahmaputra) and its major tributary, the Nyang River, the Salween, the Yangtze, the Mekong, and the Yellow River. The Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon, formed by a horseshoe bend in the river where it flows around Namcha Barwa, is the deepest and possibly longest canyon in the world.[16] Among the mountains there are many narrow valleys. The valleys of Lhasa, Xigazê, Gyantse and the Brahmaputra are free from permafrost, covered with good soil and groves of trees, well irrigated, and richly cultivated.\n\n\nThe South Tibet Valley is formed by the Yarlung Tsangpo River during its middle reaches, where it travels from west to east. The valley is approximately 1,200 km (750 mi) long and 300 km (190 mi) wide. The valley descends from 4,500 m (14,760 ft) above sea level to 2,800 m (9,190 ft). The mountains on either side of the valley are usually around 5,000 m (16,400 ft) high.[17][18] Lakes here include Lake Paiku and Lake Puma Yumco.\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: People's Government of Tibet Autonomous Region, List of modern political leaders of Tibet, and List of current Chinese provincial leaders\n\nThe Tibet Autonomous Region is a province-level entity of the People's Republic of China. Chinese law nominally guarantees some autonomy in the areas of education and language policy. Like other subdivisions of China, routine administration is carried out by a People's Government, headed by a chairman, who has been an ethnic Tibetan except for an interregnum during the Cultural Revolution. As with other Chinese provinces, the Chairman carries out work under the direction of the regional secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. The regional standing committee of the Communist Party serves as the top rung of political power in the region. The current Chairman is Yan Jinhai and the current party secretary is Wang Junzheng.\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region and List of township-level divisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region.\n\nThe Autonomous Region is divided into seven prefecture-level divisions: six prefecture-level cities and one prefecture.\n\n\nThese in turn are subdivided into a total of 66 counties and 8 districts (Chengguan, Doilungdêqên, Dagzê, Samzhubzê, Karub, Bayi, Nêdong, and Seni).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Administrative divisions of Tibet Autonomous Region\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Lhasa**\n\n**Xigazê**\n\n**Qamdo**\n\n**Nyingchi**\n\n**Shannan**\n\n**Nagqu**\n\n**NgariPrefecture**\n\n☐ **Areas disputed with India or Bhutan (see Sino-Indian border dispute and Bhutanese enclaves)**\n |\n| Division code[19] | Division\n | Area in km2[20] | Population 2020[21] | Seat\n | Divisions[22] |\n| Districts | Counties | CL cities |\n| 540000 | Tibet Autonomous Region\n | 1,228,400.00 | 3,648,100 | Lhasa city | 8 | 64 | 2\n |\n| 540100 | Lhasa city\n | 29,538.90 | 867,891 | Chengguan District | 3 | 5 |  |\n| 540200 | Shigatse / Xigazê city\n | 182,066.26 | 798,153 | Samzhubzê District | 1 | 17 |  |\n| 540300 | Chamdo / Qamdo city\n | 108,872.30 | 760,966 | Karuo District | 1 | 10 |  |\n| 540400 | Nyingchi city\n | 113,964.79 | 238,936 | Bayi District | 1 | 5 | 1\n |\n| 540500 | Shannan / Lhoka city\n | 79,287.84 | 354,035 | Nêdong District | 1 | 10 | 1\n |\n| 540600 | Nagqu city\n | 391,816.63 | 504,838 | Seni District | 1 | 10 |  |\n| 542500 | Ngari Prefecture | 296,822.62 | 123,281 | Gar County |  | 7 |  |\n\n\n![](image)Yamdrok Lake\n![](image)Namtso Lake\n\n\n| Administrative divisions in Tibetan, Chinese, and varieties of romanizations\n |\n| --- |\n| English | Tibetan | Tibetan Pinyin | Wylie transliteration | Chinese | Pinyin\n |\n| **Tibet Autonomous Region** | བོད་རང་སྐྱོང་ལྗོངས། | **Poi Ranggyongjong** | **bod rang skyong ljongs** | 西藏自治区 | **Xīzàng Zìzhìqū** |\n| Lhasa city | ལྷ་ས་གྲོང་ཁྱེར། | Lhasa Chongkyir | lha sa grong khyer | 拉萨市 | Lāsà Shì\n |\n| Xigazê city | གཞིས་ཀ་རྩེ་གྲོང་ཁྱེར། | Xigazê Chongkyir | ggzhis ka rtse grong khyer | 日喀则市 | Rìkāzé Shì\n |\n| Qamdo city | ཆབ་མདོ་གྲོང་ཁྱེར། | Qamdo Chongkyir | chab mdo grong khyer | 昌都市 | Chāngdū Shì\n |\n| Nyingchi city | ཉིང་ཁྲི་གྲོང་ཁྱེར། | Nyingchi Chongkyir | nying khri grong khyer | 林芝市 | Línzhī Shì\n |\n| Shannan city | ལྷོ་ཁ་གྲོང་ཁྱེར། | Lhoka Chongkyir | lho kha grong khyer | 山南市 | Shānnán Shì\n |\n| Nagqu city | ནག་ཆུ་གྲོང་ཁྱེར། | Nagqu Chongkyir | nag chu grong khyer | 那曲市 | Nàqū Shì\n |\n| Ngari Prefecture | མངའ་རིས་ས་ཁུལ། | Ngari Sakü | mnga' ris sa khul | 阿里地区 | Ālǐ Dìqū\n |\n\n\n#### Urban areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Population by urban areas of prefecture & county cities\n |\n| --- |\n| # | City | Urban area[23] | District area[23] | City proper[23] | Census date\n |\n| 1 | **Lhasa**[a] | 199,159 | 279,074 | 559,423 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (1) | Lhasa (new districts)[a] | 21,093 | 78,957 | *see Lhasa* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 2 | Xigazê[b] | 63,967 | 120,374 | 703,292 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (3) | Qamdo[c] | 44,028 | 116,500 | 657,505 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (4) | Nagqu[d] | 42,984 | 108,781 | 462,381 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (5) | Nyingchi[e] | 35,179 | 54,702 | 195,109 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (6) | Shannan[f] | 30,646 | 59,615 | 328,990 | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** New districts established after census: Doilungdêqên (Doilungdêqên County), Dagzê (Dagzê County).

There is also a tiny Tibetan Christian community in eastern Tibet. Smaller tribal groups such as the Monpa and Lhoba, who follow a combination of Tibetan Buddhism and spirit worship, are found mainly in the southeastern parts of the region.\n\n\nHistorically, the population of Tibet consisted of primarily ethnic Tibetans. According to tradition the original ancestors of the Tibetan people, as represented by the six red bands in the Tibetan flag, are: the Se, Mu, Dong, Tong, Dru and Ra. Other traditional ethnic groups with significant population or with the majority of the ethnic group reside in Tibet include Bai people, Blang, Bonan, Dongxiang, Han, Hui people, Lhoba, Lisu people, Miao, Mongols, Monguor (Tu people), Menba (Monpa), Mosuo, Nakhi, Qiang, Nu people, Pumi, Salar, and Yi people.\n\n\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition published between 1910 and 1911, the total population of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, including the lamas in the city and vicinity, was about 30,000, and the permanent population also included Chinese families (about 2,000).[38]\n\n\nMost Han people in the Tibet Autonomous Region (12.2% of the total population)[36] are recent migrants, because all of the Han were expelled from \"Outer Tibet\" (Central Tibet) following the British invasion until the establishment of the PRC.[39]\nOnly 8% of Han people have household registration in TAR, others keep their household registration in place of origin.[40]\n\n\nTibetan scholars and exiles claim that, with the 2006 completion of the Qingzang Railway connecting the Tibet Autonomous Region to Qinghai Province, there has been an \"acceleration\" of Han migration into the region.[41] The Tibetan government-in-exile based in northern India asserts that the PRC is promoting the migration of Han workers and soldiers to Tibet to marginalize and assimilate the locals.[42]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Tibet\n\n| Religion in Tibet (2012 estimates)[43] |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| Tibetan Buddhism |  | 78.5% |\n| Bon |  | 12.5% |\n| Chinese folk religion |  | 8.58% |\n| Islam[44] |  | 0.4% |\n| Christianity |  | 0.02% |\n\n![](image)Maitreya Buddha statue of Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse\nThe main religion in Tibet has been Buddhism since its outspread in the 8th century AD. Before the arrival of Buddhism, the main religion among Tibetans was an indigenous shamanic and animistic religion, Bon, which now comprises a sizeable minority and influenced the formation of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n\nAccording to estimates from the International Religious Freedom Report of 2012, most Tibetans (who comprise 91% of the population of the Tibet Autonomous Region) are adherents of Tibetan Buddhism, while a minority of 400,000 people are followers the native Bon or folk religions which share the image of Confucius (Tibetan: *Kongtse Trulgyi Gyalpo*) with Chinese folk religion, though in a different light.[45][46] According to some reports, the government of China has been promoting the Bon religion, linking it with Confucianism.[47]\n\n\nMost of the Han Chinese who reside in Tibet practice their native Chinese folk religion (神道; *shén dào*; 'Way of the Gods'). There is a Guandi Temple of Lhasa (拉萨关帝庙) where the Chinese god of war Guandi is identified with the cross-ethnic Chinese, Tibetan, Mongol and Manchu deity Gesar. The temple is built according to both Chinese and Tibetan architecture. It was first erected in 1792 under the Qing dynasty and renovated around 2013 after decades of disrepair.[48][49]\n\n\nBuilt or rebuilt between 2014 and 2015 is the Guandi Temple of Qomolangma (Mount Everest), on Ganggar Mount, in Tingri County.[50][51]\n\n\nThere are four mosques in the Tibet Autonomous Region with approximately 4,000 to 5,000 Muslim adherents,[43] although a 2010 Chinese survey found a higher proportion of 0.4%.[44] There is a Catholic church with 700 parishioners, which is located in the traditionally Catholic community of Yanjing in the east of the region.[43]\n\n\n\n## Human rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human rights in Tibet\n\n![](image)Chinese army division moving from Golmud to Lhasa\nBefore the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China in 1951, Tibet was ruled by a theocracy[52] and had a caste-like social hierarchy.[53] Human rights in Tibet prior to its incorporation into the People's Republic of China differed considerably from those in the modern era. Due to tight control of press in mainland China, including the Tibet Autonomous Region,[54] it is difficult to accurately determine the scope of human rights abuses.[55]\n\n\nCritics of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) say the CCP's official aim to eliminate \"the three evils of separatism, terrorism and religious extremism\" is used as a pretext for human rights abuses.[56] A 1992 Amnesty International report stated that judicial standards in the Tibet Autonomous Region were not up to \"international standards\". The report charged the CCP[57] government with keeping political prisoners and prisoners of conscience; ill-treatment of detainees, including torture, and inaction in the face of ill-treatment; the use of the death penalty; extrajudicial executions;[57][58] and forced abortion and sterilization.[59][60][61][62][63]\n\n\n\n## Towns and villages in Tibet[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of populated places in the Tibet Autonomous Region\n\n### Comfortable Housing Program[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 2006, 280,000 Tibetans who lived in traditional villages and as nomadic herdsmen have been forcefully relocated into villages and towns. In those areas, new housing was built and existing houses were remodelled to serve a total of 2 million people.\nThose living in substandard housing were required to dismantle their houses and remodel them to government standards. Much of the expense was borne by the residents themselves,[64] often through bank loans. The population transfer program, which was first implemented in Qinghai where 300,000 nomads were resettled, is called \"Comfortable Housing\", which is part of the \"Build a New Socialist Countryside\" program. Its effect on Tibetan culture has been criticized by exiles and human rights groups.[64] Finding employment is difficult for relocated persons who have only agrarian skills. Income shortfalls are offset by government support programs.[65] It was announced that in 2011 that 20,000 Communist Party cadres will be placed in the new towns.[64]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Tibet\n\n\n\n| Development of GDP\n |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | GDP inbillions of yuan\n |\n| 1995\n | 5.61\n |\n| 2000\n | 11.78\n |\n| 2005\n | 24.88\n |\n| 2010\n | 50.75\n |\n| 2015\n | 102.64\n |\n| 2021\n | 208.18[66] |\n| Source:[67] |\n\n\nFrom the 1951 Seventeen Point Agreement to 2003, life expectancy in Tibet increased from thirty-six years to sixty-seven years with infant mortality and absolute poverty declining steadily.[68]\n\n\nThe Tibetans traditionally depended upon agriculture for survival. Since the 1980s, however, other jobs such as taxi-driving and hotel retail work have become available in the wake of Chinese economic reform. In 2011, Tibet's GDP topped 60.5 billion yuan (US$9.60 billion), nearly more than seven times as big as the 11.78 billion yuan (US$1.47 billion) in 2000. Economic growth since the beginning of the 21st century has averaged over 10 percent a year.[35]\n\n\nBy 2022, the GDP of the region surpassed 213 billion yuan (US$31.7 billion in nominal), while GDP per capita reached CN¥58,438 (US$8,688 in nominal).[3] In 2022, Tibet's GDP per capita ranked 25th highest in China, as well as higher than any South Asian country except Maldives.[69] In 2008, Chinese news media reported that the per capita disposable incomes of urban and rural residents in Tibet averaged (CN¥12,482 (US$1,798) and CN¥3,176 (US$457) respectively.[70]\n\n\nWhile traditional agriculture and animal husbandry continue to lead the area's economy, in 2005 the tertiary sector contributed more than half of its GDP growth, the first time it surpassed the area's primary industry.[71][72] Rich reserves of natural resources and raw materials have yet to lead to the creation of a strong secondary sector, due in large part to the province's inhospitable terrain, low population density, an underdeveloped infrastructure and the high cost of extraction.[35]\n\n\nThe collection of caterpillar fungus (*Cordyceps sinensis*, known in Tibetan as *Yartsa Gunbu*) in late spring / early summer is in many areas the most important source of cash for rural households. It contributes an average of 40% to rural cash income and 8.5% to the Tibet Autonomous Region's GDP.[73]\n\n\nThe re-opening of the Nathu La pass (on southern Tibet's border with India) should facilitate Sino-Indian border trade and boost Tibet's economy.[74]\n\n\nThe China Western Development policy was adopted in 2000 by the central government to boost economic development in western China, including the Tibet Autonomous Region.\n\n\n\n* Lhasa Economic and Technological Development Zone\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nThere are 4 universities and 3 special colleges in Tibet,[75] including Tibet University, Tibet University for Nationalities, Tibet Tibetan Medical University, Tibet Agricultural and Animal Husbandry College, Lhasa Teachers College, Tibet Police College and Tibet Vocational and Technical College.\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\nForeign tourists were first permitted to visit the Tibet Autonomous Region in the 1980s. While the main attraction is the Potala Palace in Lhasa, there are many other popular tourist destinations including the Jokhang Temple, Namtso Lake, and Tashilhunpo Monastery.[76] Nonetheless, tourism in Tibet is still restricted for non-Chinese passport holders (including citizens of the Republic of China from Taiwan), and foreigners must apply for a Tibet Entry Permit to enter the region.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nA 2019 white paper from The State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China reported Tibet's road system has achieved a total of 118,800 km.[77]\n\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nThe civil airports in Tibet are Lhasa Gonggar Airport,[78] Qamdo Bangda Airport, Nyingchi Airport, and the Gunsa Airport.\n\n\nGunsa Airport in Ngari Prefecture began operations on 1 July 2010, to become the fourth civil airport in China's Tibet Autonomous Region.[79]\n\n\nThe Peace Airport for Xigazê was opened for civilian use on 30 October 2010.[80]\n\n\nAnnounced in 2010, Nagqu Dagring Airport was expected to become the world's highest altitude airport, at 4,436 meters above sea level.[81] However, in 2015 it was reported that construction of the airport has been delayed due to the necessity to develop higher technological standards.[82]\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nThe Qinghai–Tibet Railway from Golmud to Lhasa was completed on 12 October 2005. It opened to regular trial service on 1 July 2006. Five pairs of passenger trains run between Golmud and Lhasa, with connections onward to Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Xining and Lanzhou. The line includes the Tanggula Pass, which, at 5,072 m (16,640 ft) above sea level, is the world's highest railway.\n\n\nThe Lhasa–Xigazê Railway branch from Lhasa to Xigazê was completed in 2014. It opened to regular service on 15 August 2014. The planned China–Nepal railway will connect Xigazê to Kathmandu, capital of Nepal, and is expected to be completed around 2027.[83]\n\n\nThe construction of the Sichuan–Tibet Railway began in 2015. The line is expected to be completed around 2025.[84]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n\n\n* China Tibetology Research Center\n* Annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China\n* History of Tibet (1950–present)\n* Kazara\n* List of prisons in the Tibet Autonomous Region\n* List of universities and colleges in Tibet\n* Tibet Area (administrative division)\n* Tibetan independence movement\n* Sinicization of Tibet\n* Shigatse Photovoltaic Power Plant\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Chinese: 西藏; pinyin: *Xīzàng, Mandarin pronunciation: [ɕí.tsâŋ]*; lit.

It was overlayed on the traditional Tibetan regions of Ü-Tsang and Kham.\n\n\nIt was formally established in 1965 to replace the Tibet Area, the former administrative division of the People's Republic of China (PRC) established after the annexation of Tibet. The establishment was about five years after the 1959 Tibetan uprising and the dismissal of the Kashag, and about 13 years after the original annexation.\n\n\nThe current borders of the Tibet Autonomous Region were generally established in the 18th century[5] and include about half of historic Tibet, or the ethno-cultural Tibet. The Tibet Autonomous Region spans over 1,200,000 km2 (460,000 sq mi) and is the second-largest province-level division of China by area, after Xinjiang. Due to its harsh and rugged terrain, it is sparsely populated at just over 3.6 million people with a population density of 3 inhabitants per square kilometre (7.8/sq mi).\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Part of a series on the\n |\n| --- |\n| History of Tibet |\n| ![Potala Palace](image) |\n| * Neolithic Tibet\n* Zhangzhung\n* Yarlung dynasty\n* Tibetan Empire\n* Era of Fragmentation\n* Yuan rule\n* Phagmodrupa dynasty\n* Rinpungpa dynasty\n* Tsangpa dynasty\n* Khoshut Khanate\n* Ganden Phodrang\n* Ming–Tibet relations\n* Qing rule\n* 13th and 14th Dalai Lama\n* PRC rule\n |\n| \nSee also |\n| * Timeline\n* Historical money\n* List of rulers\n* European exploration\n |\n| ![icon](image) Asia portal • ![flag](image) China portal |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nMain article: History of Tibet\n\n Yarlung kings founded the Tibetan Empire in 618. By the end of the 8th century, the empire reached its greatest extent. After a civil war, the empire broke up in 842. The royal lineage fragmented and ruled over small kingdoms such as Guge, Maryul and Nyingma. The Mongol Empire conquered Tibet in 1244 but granted the region a degree of political autonomy. Kublai Khan later incorporated Tibetans into his Yuan empire (1271–1368). The Sakya lama Drogön Chögyal Phagpa became religious teacher to Kublai in the 1250s, and was made the head of the Tibetan region administration c. 1264.\n\n\nFrom 1354 to 1642, Central Tibet (Ü-Tsang) was ruled by a succession of dynasties from Nêdong, Shigatse and Lhasa. In 1642, the Ganden Phodrang court of the 5th Dalai Lama was established by Güshi Khan of the Khoshut Khanate, who was enthroned as King (chogyal) of Tibet. The Khoshuts ruled until 1717, when they were overthrown by the Dzungar Khanate. The Dzungar forces were in turn expelled by the 1720 Manchu  expedition to Tibet during the Dzungar–Qing Wars. This began  Qing rule over Tibet: Tibet came under the direct control of the central Chinese government.[6]\n\n\nDespite some politically-charged historical debate on the exact nature of  Sino-Tibetan relations,[7][8][9] most historians [*who?*] agree that Tibet under the Ganden Phodrang (1642 to c. 1951) was an independent state, albeit the country had been under different foreign suzerainties for much of its history – including during the Ming dynasty period (1368–1644).\n\n\nFrom 1912 to 1950, the State of Tibet became *de facto* independent after the fall of the Qing dynasty, like many other regions of the successor Republic of China. The Republic of China régime, preoccupied with fractious  warlordism (1916–1928),  civil war (1927–1949) and  Japanese invasion (1937–1945), failed to assert its authority in Tibet. Other smaller kingdoms of ethno-cultural Tibet in eastern Kham and Amdo had been under *de jure* administration of the Chinese dynastic government since the mid-18th century;[10] as of 2022[update] they variously form parts of the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan. (See also: Xikang Province)\n\n\nIn 1950, after the 1949 establishment of the People's Republic of China, the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet and defeated the Tibetan local army in a battle fought near the city of Chamdo. In 1951, Tibetan representatives signed a  17-point agreement with the Central People's Government affirming China's sovereignty over Tibet and the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China. The 14th Dalai Lama ratified the agreement in October 1951.[11][12][13] After a failed violent  uprising, the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 and renounced the 17-point agreement. The  establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1965 made Tibet a provincial-level division of China.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Tibet\n\nThe Tibet Autonomous Region is located on the Tibetan Plateau, the highest region on Earth. In northern Tibet elevations reach an average of over 4,572 metres (15,000 ft). Mount Everest is located on Tibet's border with Nepal.\n\n\nChina's provincial-level areas of Xinjiang, Qinghai and Sichuan lie to the north, northeast and east, respectively, of the Tibet AR. There is also a short border with Yunnan Province to the southeast. The countries to the south and southwest are Myanmar, India, Bhutan, and Nepal. China claims Arunachal Pradesh administered by India as part of the Tibet Autonomous Region. It also claims some areas adjoining the Chumbi Valley that are recognised as Bhutan's territory, and some areas of eastern Ladakh claimed by India. India and China agreed to respect the Line of Actual Control in a bilateral agreement signed on 7 September 1993.[14][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mount Everest\nPhysically, the Tibet AR may be divided into two parts: the lakes region in the west and north-west and the river region, which spreads out on three sides of the former on the east, south and west. Both regions receive limited amounts of rainfall as they lie in the rain shadow of the Himalayas; however, the region names are useful in contrasting their hydrological structures, and also in contrasting their different cultural uses: nomadic in the lake region and agricultural in the river region.[15] On the south the Tibet AR is bounded by the Himalayas, and on the north by a broad mountain system. The system at no point narrows to a single range; generally there are three or four across its breadth. As a whole the system forms the watershed between rivers flowing to the Indian Ocean — the Indus, Brahmaputra and Salween and its tributaries — and the streams flowing into the undrained salt lakes to the north.\n\n\nThe lake region extends from the Pangong Tso Lake in Ladakh, Lake Rakshastal, Yamdrok Lake and Lake Manasarovar near the source of the Indus River, to the sources of the Salween, the Mekong and the Yangtze. Other lakes include Dagze Co, Namtso, and Pagsum Co. The lake region is a wind-swept Alpine grassland. This region is called the Chang Tang (Byang sang) or 'Northern Plateau' by the people of Tibet. It is 1,100 km (680 mi) broad and covers an area about equal to that of France. Due to its great distance from the ocean it is extremely arid and possesses no river outlet. The mountain ranges are spread out, rounded, disconnected, and separated by relatively flat valleys.\n\n\nThe Tibet AR is dotted over with large and small lakes, generally salt or alkaline, and intersected by streams. Due to the presence of discontinuous permafrost over the Chang Tang, the soil is boggy and covered with tussocks of grass, thus resembling the Siberian tundra. Salt and fresh-water lakes are intermingled. The lakes are generally without outlet, or have only a small effluent. The deposits consist of soda, potash, borax and common salt. The lake region is noted for a vast number of hot springs, which are widely distributed between the Himalaya and 34° N, but are most numerous to the west of Tengri Nor (north-west of Lhasa). So intense is the cold in this part of Tibet that these springs are sometimes represented by columns of ice, the nearly boiling water having frozen in the act of ejection.\n\n\nThe river region is characterized by fertile mountain valleys and includes the Yarlung Tsangpo River (the upper courses of the Brahmaputra) and its major tributary, the Nyang River, the Salween, the Yangtze, the Mekong, and the Yellow River. The Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon, formed by a horseshoe bend in the river where it flows around Namcha Barwa, is the deepest and possibly longest canyon in the world.[16] Among the mountains there are many narrow valleys. The valleys of Lhasa, Xigazê, Gyantse and the Brahmaputra are free from permafrost, covered with good soil and groves of trees, well irrigated, and richly cultivated.\n\n\nThe South Tibet Valley is formed by the Yarlung Tsangpo River during its middle reaches, where it travels from west to east. The valley is approximately 1,200 km (750 mi) long and 300 km (190 mi) wide. The valley descends from 4,500 m (14,760 ft) above sea level to 2,800 m (9,190 ft). The mountains on either side of the valley are usually around 5,000 m (16,400 ft) high.[17][18] Lakes here include Lake Paiku and Lake Puma Yumco.\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: People's Government of Tibet Autonomous Region, List of modern political leaders of Tibet, and List of current Chinese provincial leaders\n\nThe Tibet Autonomous Region is a province-level entity of the People's Republic of China. Chinese law nominally guarantees some autonomy in the areas of education and language policy. Like other subdivisions of China, routine administration is carried out by a People's Government, headed by a chairman, who has been an ethnic Tibetan except for an interregnum during the Cultural Revolution. As with other Chinese provinces, the Chairman carries out work under the direction of the regional secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. The regional standing committee of the Communist Party serves as the top rung of political power in the region. The current Chairman is Yan Jinhai and the current party secretary is Wang Junzheng.\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region and List of township-level divisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region.\n\nThe Autonomous Region is divided into seven prefecture-level divisions: six prefecture-level cities and one prefecture.\n\n\nThese in turn are subdivided into a total of 66 counties and 8 districts (Chengguan, Doilungdêqên, Dagzê, Samzhubzê, Karub, Bayi, Nêdong, and Seni).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Administrative divisions of Tibet Autonomous Region\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Lhasa**\n\n**Xigazê**\n\n**Qamdo**\n\n**Nyingchi**\n\n**Shannan**\n\n**Nagqu**\n\n**NgariPrefecture**\n\n☐ **Areas disputed with India or Bhutan (see Sino-Indian border dispute and Bhutanese enclaves)**\n |\n| Division code[19] | Division\n | Area in km2[20] | Population 2020[21] | Seat\n | Divisions[22] |\n| Districts | Counties | CL cities |\n| 540000 | Tibet Autonomous Region\n | 1,228,400.00 | 3,648,100 | Lhasa city | 8 | 64 | 2\n |\n| 540100 | Lhasa city\n | 29,538.90 | 867,891 | Chengguan District | 3 | 5 |  |\n| 540200 | Shigatse / Xigazê city\n | 182,066.26 | 798,153 | Samzhubzê District | 1 | 17 |  |\n| 540300 | Chamdo / Qamdo city\n | 108,872.30 | 760,966 | Karuo District | 1 | 10 |  |\n| 540400 | Nyingchi city\n | 113,964.79 | 238,936 | Bayi District | 1 | 5 | 1\n |\n| 540500 | Shannan / Lhoka city\n | 79,287.84 | 354,035 | Nêdong District | 1 | 10 | 1\n |\n| 540600 | Nagqu city\n | 391,816.63 | 504,838 | Seni District | 1 | 10 |  |\n| 542500 | Ngari Prefecture | 296,822.62 | 123,281 | Gar County |  | 7 |  |\n\n\n![](image)Yamdrok Lake\n![](image)Namtso Lake\n\n\n| Administrative divisions in Tibetan, Chinese, and varieties of romanizations\n |\n| --- |\n| English | Tibetan | Tibetan Pinyin | Wylie transliteration | Chinese | Pinyin\n |\n| **Tibet Autonomous Region** | བོད་རང་སྐྱོང་ལྗོངས། | **Poi Ranggyongjong** | **bod rang skyong ljongs** | 西藏自治区 | **Xīzàng Zìzhìqū** |\n| Lhasa city | ལྷ་ས་གྲོང་ཁྱེར། | Lhasa Chongkyir | lha sa grong khyer | 拉萨市 | Lāsà Shì\n |\n| Xigazê city | གཞིས་ཀ་རྩེ་གྲོང་ཁྱེར། | Xigazê Chongkyir | ggzhis ka rtse grong khyer | 日喀则市 | Rìkāzé Shì\n |\n| Qamdo city | ཆབ་མདོ་གྲོང་ཁྱེར། | Qamdo Chongkyir | chab mdo grong khyer | 昌都市 | Chāngdū Shì\n |\n| Nyingchi city | ཉིང་ཁྲི་གྲོང་ཁྱེར། | Nyingchi Chongkyir | nying khri grong khyer | 林芝市 | Línzhī Shì\n |\n| Shannan city | ལྷོ་ཁ་གྲོང་ཁྱེར། | Lhoka Chongkyir | lho kha grong khyer | 山南市 | Shānnán Shì\n |\n| Nagqu city | ནག་ཆུ་གྲོང་ཁྱེར། | Nagqu Chongkyir | nag chu grong khyer | 那曲市 | Nàqū Shì\n |\n| Ngari Prefecture | མངའ་རིས་ས་ཁུལ། | Ngari Sakü | mnga' ris sa khul | 阿里地区 | Ālǐ Dìqū\n |\n\n\n#### Urban areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Population by urban areas of prefecture & county cities\n |\n| --- |\n| # | City | Urban area[23] | District area[23] | City proper[23] | Census date\n |\n| 1 | **Lhasa**[a] | 199,159 | 279,074 | 559,423 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (1) | Lhasa (new districts)[a] | 21,093 | 78,957 | *see Lhasa* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 2 | Xigazê[b] | 63,967 | 120,374 | 703,292 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (3) | Qamdo[c] | 44,028 | 116,500 | 657,505 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (4) | Nagqu[d] | 42,984 | 108,781 | 462,381 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (5) | Nyingchi[e] | 35,179 | 54,702 | 195,109 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (6) | Shannan[f] | 30,646 | 59,615 | 328,990 | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** New districts established after census: Doilungdêqên (Doilungdêqên County), Dagzê (Dagzê County).

There is also a tiny Tibetan Christian community in eastern Tibet. Smaller tribal groups such as the Monpa and Lhoba, who follow a combination of Tibetan Buddhism and spirit worship, are found mainly in the southeastern parts of the region.\n\n\nHistorically, the population of Tibet consisted of primarily ethnic Tibetans. According to tradition the original ancestors of the Tibetan people, as represented by the six red bands in the Tibetan flag, are: the Se, Mu, Dong, Tong, Dru and Ra. Other traditional ethnic groups with significant population or with the majority of the ethnic group reside in Tibet include Bai people, Blang, Bonan, Dongxiang, Han, Hui people, Lhoba, Lisu people, Miao, Mongols, Monguor (Tu people), Menba (Monpa), Mosuo, Nakhi, Qiang, Nu people, Pumi, Salar, and Yi people.\n\n\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition published between 1910 and 1911, the total population of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, including the lamas in the city and vicinity, was about 30,000, and the permanent population also included Chinese families (about 2,000).[38]\n\n\nMost Han people in the Tibet Autonomous Region (12.2% of the total population)[36] are recent migrants, because all of the Han were expelled from \"Outer Tibet\" (Central Tibet) following the British invasion until the establishment of the PRC.[39]\nOnly 8% of Han people have household registration in TAR, others keep their household registration in place of origin.[40]\n\n\nTibetan scholars and exiles claim that, with the 2006 completion of the Qingzang Railway connecting the Tibet Autonomous Region to Qinghai Province, there has been an \"acceleration\" of Han migration into the region.[41] The Tibetan government-in-exile based in northern India asserts that the PRC is promoting the migration of Han workers and soldiers to Tibet to marginalize and assimilate the locals.[42]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Tibet\n\n| Religion in Tibet (2012 estimates)[43] |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| Tibetan Buddhism |  | 78.5% |\n| Bon |  | 12.5% |\n| Chinese folk religion |  | 8.58% |\n| Islam[44] |  | 0.4% |\n| Christianity |  | 0.02% |\n\n![](image)Maitreya Buddha statue of Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse\nThe main religion in Tibet has been Buddhism since its outspread in the 8th century AD. Before the arrival of Buddhism, the main religion among Tibetans was an indigenous shamanic and animistic religion, Bon, which now comprises a sizeable minority and influenced the formation of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n\nAccording to estimates from the International Religious Freedom Report of 2012, most Tibetans (who comprise 91% of the population of the Tibet Autonomous Region) are adherents of Tibetan Buddhism, while a minority of 400,000 people are followers the native Bon or folk religions which share the image of Confucius (Tibetan: *Kongtse Trulgyi Gyalpo*) with Chinese folk religion, though in a different light.[45][46] According to some reports, the government of China has been promoting the Bon religion, linking it with Confucianism.[47]\n\n\nMost of the Han Chinese who reside in Tibet practice their native Chinese folk religion (神道; *shén dào*; 'Way of the Gods'). There is a Guandi Temple of Lhasa (拉萨关帝庙) where the Chinese god of war Guandi is identified with the cross-ethnic Chinese, Tibetan, Mongol and Manchu deity Gesar. The temple is built according to both Chinese and Tibetan architecture. It was first erected in 1792 under the Qing dynasty and renovated around 2013 after decades of disrepair.[48][49]\n\n\nBuilt or rebuilt between 2014 and 2015 is the Guandi Temple of Qomolangma (Mount Everest), on Ganggar Mount, in Tingri County.[50][51]\n\n\nThere are four mosques in the Tibet Autonomous Region with approximately 4,000 to 5,000 Muslim adherents,[43] although a 2010 Chinese survey found a higher proportion of 0.4%.[44] There is a Catholic church with 700 parishioners, which is located in the traditionally Catholic community of Yanjing in the east of the region.[43]\n\n\n\n## Human rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human rights in Tibet\n\n![](image)Chinese army division moving from Golmud to Lhasa\nBefore the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China in 1951, Tibet was ruled by a theocracy[52] and had a caste-like social hierarchy.[53] Human rights in Tibet prior to its incorporation into the People's Republic of China differed considerably from those in the modern era. Due to tight control of press in mainland China, including the Tibet Autonomous Region,[54] it is difficult to accurately determine the scope of human rights abuses.[55]\n\n\nCritics of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) say the CCP's official aim to eliminate \"the three evils of separatism, terrorism and religious extremism\" is used as a pretext for human rights abuses.[56] A 1992 Amnesty International report stated that judicial standards in the Tibet Autonomous Region were not up to \"international standards\". The report charged the CCP[57] government with keeping political prisoners and prisoners of conscience; ill-treatment of detainees, including torture, and inaction in the face of ill-treatment; the use of the death penalty; extrajudicial executions;[57][58] and forced abortion and sterilization.[59][60][61][62][63]\n\n\n\n## Towns and villages in Tibet[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of populated places in the Tibet Autonomous Region\n\n### Comfortable Housing Program[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 2006, 280,000 Tibetans who lived in traditional villages and as nomadic herdsmen have been forcefully relocated into villages and towns. In those areas, new housing was built and existing houses were remodelled to serve a total of 2 million people.\nThose living in substandard housing were required to dismantle their houses and remodel them to government standards. Much of the expense was borne by the residents themselves,[64] often through bank loans. The population transfer program, which was first implemented in Qinghai where 300,000 nomads were resettled, is called \"Comfortable Housing\", which is part of the \"Build a New Socialist Countryside\" program. Its effect on Tibetan culture has been criticized by exiles and human rights groups.[64] Finding employment is difficult for relocated persons who have only agrarian skills. Income shortfalls are offset by government support programs.[65] It was announced that in 2011 that 20,000 Communist Party cadres will be placed in the new towns.[64]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Tibet\n\n\n\n| Development of GDP\n |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | GDP inbillions of yuan\n |\n| 1995\n | 5.61\n |\n| 2000\n | 11.78\n |\n| 2005\n | 24.88\n |\n| 2010\n | 50.75\n |\n| 2015\n | 102.64\n |\n| 2021\n | 208.18[66] |\n| Source:[67] |\n\n\nFrom the 1951 Seventeen Point Agreement to 2003, life expectancy in Tibet increased from thirty-six years to sixty-seven years with infant mortality and absolute poverty declining steadily.[68]\n\n\nThe Tibetans traditionally depended upon agriculture for survival. Since the 1980s, however, other jobs such as taxi-driving and hotel retail work have become available in the wake of Chinese economic reform. In 2011, Tibet's GDP topped 60.5 billion yuan (US$9.60 billion), nearly more than seven times as big as the 11.78 billion yuan (US$1.47 billion) in 2000. Economic growth since the beginning of the 21st century has averaged over 10 percent a year.[35]\n\n\nBy 2022, the GDP of the region surpassed 213 billion yuan (US$31.7 billion in nominal), while GDP per capita reached CN¥58,438 (US$8,688 in nominal).[3] In 2022, Tibet's GDP per capita ranked 25th highest in China, as well as higher than any South Asian country except Maldives.[69] In 2008, Chinese news media reported that the per capita disposable incomes of urban and rural residents in Tibet averaged (CN¥12,482 (US$1,798) and CN¥3,176 (US$457) respectively.[70]\n\n\nWhile traditional agriculture and animal husbandry continue to lead the area's economy, in 2005 the tertiary sector contributed more than half of its GDP growth, the first time it surpassed the area's primary industry.[71][72] Rich reserves of natural resources and raw materials have yet to lead to the creation of a strong secondary sector, due in large part to the province's inhospitable terrain, low population density, an underdeveloped infrastructure and the high cost of extraction.[35]\n\n\nThe collection of caterpillar fungus (*Cordyceps sinensis*, known in Tibetan as *Yartsa Gunbu*) in late spring / early summer is in many areas the most important source of cash for rural households. It contributes an average of 40% to rural cash income and 8.5% to the Tibet Autonomous Region's GDP.[73]\n\n\nThe re-opening of the Nathu La pass (on southern Tibet's border with India) should facilitate Sino-Indian border trade and boost Tibet's economy.[74]\n\n\nThe China Western Development policy was adopted in 2000 by the central government to boost economic development in western China, including the Tibet Autonomous Region.\n\n\n\n* Lhasa Economic and Technological Development Zone\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nThere are 4 universities and 3 special colleges in Tibet,[75] including Tibet University, Tibet University for Nationalities, Tibet Tibetan Medical University, Tibet Agricultural and Animal Husbandry College, Lhasa Teachers College, Tibet Police College and Tibet Vocational and Technical College.\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\nForeign tourists were first permitted to visit the Tibet Autonomous Region in the 1980s. While the main attraction is the Potala Palace in Lhasa, there are many other popular tourist destinations including the Jokhang Temple, Namtso Lake, and Tashilhunpo Monastery.[76] Nonetheless, tourism in Tibet is still restricted for non-Chinese passport holders (including citizens of the Republic of China from Taiwan), and foreigners must apply for a Tibet Entry Permit to enter the region.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nA 2019 white paper from The State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China reported Tibet's road system has achieved a total of 118,800 km.[77]\n\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nThe civil airports in Tibet are Lhasa Gonggar Airport,[78] Qamdo Bangda Airport, Nyingchi Airport, and the Gunsa Airport.\n\n\nGunsa Airport in Ngari Prefecture began operations on 1 July 2010, to become the fourth civil airport in China's Tibet Autonomous Region.[79]\n\n\nThe Peace Airport for Xigazê was opened for civilian use on 30 October 2010.[80]\n\n\nAnnounced in 2010, Nagqu Dagring Airport was expected to become the world's highest altitude airport, at 4,436 meters above sea level.[81] However, in 2015 it was reported that construction of the airport has been delayed due to the necessity to develop higher technological standards.[82]\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nThe Qinghai–Tibet Railway from Golmud to Lhasa was completed on 12 October 2005. It opened to regular trial service on 1 July 2006. Five pairs of passenger trains run between Golmud and Lhasa, with connections onward to Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Xining and Lanzhou. The line includes the Tanggula Pass, which, at 5,072 m (16,640 ft) above sea level, is the world's highest railway.\n\n\nThe Lhasa–Xigazê Railway branch from Lhasa to Xigazê was completed in 2014. It opened to regular service on 15 August 2014. The planned China–Nepal railway will connect Xigazê to Kathmandu, capital of Nepal, and is expected to be completed around 2027.[83]\n\n\nThe construction of the Sichuan–Tibet Railway began in 2015. The line is expected to be completed around 2025.[84]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n\n\n* China Tibetology Research Center\n* Annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China\n* History of Tibet (1950–present)\n* Kazara\n* List of prisons in the Tibet Autonomous Region\n* List of universities and colleges in Tibet\n* Tibet Area (administrative division)\n* Tibetan independence movement\n* Sinicization of Tibet\n* Shigatse Photovoltaic Power Plant\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Chinese: 西藏; pinyin: *Xīzàng, Mandarin pronunciation: [ɕí.tsâŋ]*; lit.

Its border includes two-thirds of the length of China's border with the country of Mongolia. Inner Mongolia also accounts for a small section of China's border with Russia (Zabaykalsky Krai). Its capital is Hohhot; other major cities include Baotou, Chifeng, Tongliao, and Ordos.\n\n\nThe autonomous region was established in 1947, incorporating the areas of the former Republic of China provinces of Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, Liaobei, and Xing'an, along with the northern parts of Gansu and Ningxia.\n\n\nIts area makes it the third largest Chinese administrative subdivision, constituting approximately 1,200,000 km2 (463,000 sq mi) and 12% of China's total land area. Due to its long span from east to west, Inner Mongolia is geographically divided into eastern and western divisions. The eastern division is often included in Northeastern China (Dongbei), with major cities including Tongliao, Chifeng, Hailar, and Ulanhot. The western division is included in North China, with major cities including Baotou and Hohhot. It recorded a population of 24,706,321 in the 2010 census, accounting for 1.84% of Mainland China's total population. Inner Mongolia is the country's 23rd most populous province-level division.[8] The majority of the population in the region are Han Chinese, with a sizeable Mongol minority close to 5,000,000 (2019) which is the largest Mongolian population in the world (bigger than that of the country Mongolia). Inner Mongolia is one of the more economically developed provinces in China with annual GDP per capita at US$14,343 (2022), ranked 8th in the nation. The official languages are Mandarin and Mongolian, the latter of which is written in the traditional Mongolian script, as opposed to the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet, which is used in the country of Mongolia (formerly often described as Outer Mongolia).\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **possibly contains original research**.

Mongolian *dotugadu*/*gadagadu*). Inner Mongolia is distinct from Outer Mongolia, which was a term used by the Republic of China and previous governments to refer to what is now the independent state of Mongolia and the Republic of Tuva in Russia. The term Inner 内 (Nei) referred to the Nei Fan 内藩 (Inner Tributary), i.e., those descendants of Genghis Khan who were granted the title khan (king) in the Ming and Qing dynasties and lived in part of southern Mongolia. The region is sometimes called Southern Mongolia by local separatists and Mongolian irredentists.[9]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Mongolia\n\nMuch of what is known about the history of the Mongolian Plateau is taken from Chinese chronicles and historians. Before the rise of the Mongols in the 13th century, what is now central and western Inner Mongolia, especially the Hetao region, alternated in control between Chinese agriculturalists in the south, and Xiongnu, Xianbei, Khitan, Jurchen, Tujue, and nomadic Mongol of the north. The historical narrative of what is now Eastern Inner Mongolia mostly consists of alternations between different Tungusic and Mongol tribes, rather than the struggle between nomads and Chinese agriculturalists.\n\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Han dynasty in Inner Asia and Tang dynasty in Inner Asia\n\nSlab Grave cultural monuments are found in Northern, Central and Eastern Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, North-Western China, Southern, Central-Eastern and Southern Baikal territory. Mongolian scholars prove that this culture related to the Proto-Mongols.[10]\n\n\nDuring the Zhou dynasty, Central and Western Inner Mongolia (the Hetao region and surrounding areas) were inhabited by nomadic peoples such as the Loufan, Linhu and Dí, while Eastern Inner Mongolia was inhabited by the Donghu. During the Warring States period, King Wuling (340–295 BC) of the state of Zhao based in what is now Hebei and Shanxi Provinces pursued an expansionist policy towards the region. After destroying the Dí state of Zhongshan in what is now Hebei province, he defeated the Linhu and Loufan and created the Yunzhong Commandery near modern Hohhot. King Wuling of Zhao also built a long wall stretching through the Hetao region. After Qin Shi Huang created the first unified Chinese empire in 221 BC, he sent the general Meng Tian to drive the Xiongnu from the region and incorporated the old Zhao wall into the Qin dynasty Great Wall of China. He also maintained two commanderies in the region: Jiuyuan and Yunzhong and moved 30,000 households there to solidify the region. After the Qin dynasty collapsed in 206 BC, these efforts were abandoned.[11]\n\n\nDuring the Western Han dynasty, Emperor Wu sent the general Wei Qing to reconquer the Hetao region from the Xiongnu in 127 BC. After the conquest, Emperor Wu continued the policy of building settlements in Hetao to defend against the Xiong-Nu. In that same year, he established the commanderies of Shuofang and Wuyuan in Hetao. At the same time, what is now Eastern Inner Mongolia was controlled by the Xianbei, who would, later on, eclipse the Xiongnu in power and influence.\n\n\nDuring the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 AD), Xiongnu who surrendered to the Han dynasty began to be settled in Hetao and intermingled with the Han immigrants in the area. Later on, during the Western Jin dynasty, it was a Xiongnu noble from Hetao, Liu Yuan, who established the Han Zhao kingdom in the region, thereby beginning the Sixteen Kingdoms period that saw the disintegration of northern China under a variety of Han and non-Han (including Xiongnu and Xianbei) regimes.\n\n\nThe Sui dynasty (581–618) and Tang dynasty (618–907) re-established a unified Chinese empire and like their predecessors, they conquered and settled people into Hetao, though once again these efforts were aborted when the Tang empire began to collapse. Hetao (along with the rest of what now consists Inner Mongolia) was then taken over by the Liao dynasty founded by the Khitans, a nomadic people originally from what is now the southern part of Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia. They were followed by the Western Xia of the Tanguts, who took control of what is now the western part of Inner Mongolia (including Western Hetao). The Khitans were later replaced by the Jurchens, precursors to the modern Manchus, who established the Jin dynasty over Manchuria and Northern China.\n\n\n\n### Mongol and Ming periods[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mongol Empire, Mongolia under Yuan rule, Northern Yuan, and Ming dynasty in Inner Asia\n\n![](image)Persian miniature depicting Genghis Khan entering Beijing\n![](image)The Northern Yuan at its greatest extent\nAfter Genghis Khan unified the Mongol tribes in 1206 and founded the Mongol Empire, the Tangut Western Xia empire was ultimately conquered in 1227, and the Jurchen Jin dynasty fell in 1234. In 1271, Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan established the Yuan dynasty. Kublai Khan's summer capital Shangdu (aka Xanadu) was located near present-day Dolonnor. During that time Ongud and Khunggirad peoples dominated the area of what is now Inner Mongolia. After the Yuan dynasty was overthrown by the Han-led Ming dynasty in 1368, the Ming captured parts of Inner Mongolia including Shangdu and Yingchang. The Ming rebuilt the Great Wall of China at its present location, which roughly follows the southern border of the modern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (though it deviates significantly at the Hebei-Inner Mongolia border). The Ming established the Three Guards composed of the Mongols there. Soon after the Tumu incident in 1449, when the Oirat ruler Esen taishi captured the Chinese emperor, Mongols flooded south from Outer Mongolia to Inner Mongolia. Thus from then on until 1635, Inner Mongolia was the political and cultural center of the Mongols during the Northern Yuan dynasty.[12]\n\n\n\n### Qing period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mongolia under Qing rule\n\nThe eastern Mongol tribes near and in Manchuria, particularly the Khorchin and Southern Khalkha in today's Inner Mongolia intermarried, formed alliances with, and fought against the Jurchen tribes until Nurhaci, the founder of the new Jin dynasty, consolidated his control over all groups in the area in 1593.[13] The Manchus gained far-reaching control of the Inner Mongolian tribes in 1635, when Ligden Khan's son surrendered the Chakhar Mongol tribes to the Manchus. The Manchus subsequently invaded Ming China in 1644, bringing it under the control of their newly established Qing dynasty. Under the Qing dynasty (1636–1912), the Mongolian Plateau was administered in a different way for each region:\n\n\n\n![](image)Mongolia plateau during early 17th century\n![](image)Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia within the Qing dynasty, c. 1820\n* \"Outer Mongolia\": This region corresponds to the modern state of Mongolia, plus the Russian-administered region of Tannu Uriankhai, and a part of northern Xinjiang. It included the four leagues (*aimag*) of the Khalkha Mongols north of the Gobi, as well as the Tannu Uriankhai and Khovd regions in northwestern Mongolia, which were overseen by the General of Uliastai from the city of Uliastai.\n* \"Inner Mongolia\": This region corresponded to most of modern Inner Mongolia and some neighbouring areas in Liaoning and Jilin provinces. The banners and tribes in this region came under six leagues (*chuulghan*): Jirim, Juuuda, Josutu, Xilingol, Ulanqab, and Yekejuu.\n* \"Taoxi Mongolia\": The Alashan Öölüd and Ejine Torghuud banners were separate from the aimags of Outer Mongolia and the chuulghans of Inner Mongolia. This territory is equivalent to modern-day Alxa League, the westernmost part of what is now Inner Mongolia.\n* The Chahar Banners were controlled by the military commander of Chahar (now Zhangjiakou). Their extent corresponded to southern Ulanqab and Bayannur in modern Inner Mongolia, plus the region around Zhangjiakou in Hebei province. At the same time, the jurisdiction of some border departments of Zhili and Shanxi provinces also belonged to this region.\n* The Guihua Tümed banner was controlled by the military commander of Suiyuan (now Hohhot). This corresponds to the vicinities of the modern city of Hohhot. At the same time, the jurisdiction of some border departments of modern Shanxi province also belonged to this region.\n* The Hulunbuir region in what is now northeastern Inner Mongolia was part of the jurisdiction of the General of Heilongjiang, one of the three generals of Manchuria.\n\n\nThe Inner Mongolian Chahar leader Ligdan Khan, a descendant of Genghis Khan, opposed and fought against the Qing until he died of smallpox in 1634. Thereafter, the Inner Mongols under his son Ejei Khan surrendered to the Qing. Ejei Khan was given the title of Prince (親王; *qīn wáng*), and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrest in 1669 in Shenyang and the Kangxi Emperor gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, with 3,000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt. The revolt was put down within two months, the Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on 20 April 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. The Chahar Mongols were then put under the direct control of the Qing Emperor, unlike the other Inner Mongol leagues which maintained their autonomy.\n\n\nDespite officially prohibiting Han Chinese settlement on the Manchu and Mongol lands, by the 18th century the Qing decided to settle Han refugees from northern China who were suffering from famine, floods, and drought into Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. As a result, the Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in Manchuria and tens of thousands of hectares in Inner Mongolia by the 1780s.[14]\n\n\nOrdinary Mongols were not allowed to travel outside their own leagues. Mongols were forbidden by the Qing from crossing the borders of their banners, even into other Mongol Banners and from crossing into neidi (the Han Chinese 18 provinces) and were given serious punishments if they did in order to keep the Mongols divided against each other to benefit the Qing.[15] Mongol pilgrims wanting to leave their banner's borders for religious reasons such as pilgrimage had to apply for passports to give them permission.[16]\n\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, growing numbers of Han Chinese settlers had illegally begun to move into the Inner Mongolian steppe. By 1791, there had been so many Han Chinese settlers in the Front Gorlos Banner that the jasak had petitioned the Qing government to legalise the status of the peasants who had already settled there.[17]\n\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, the Manchus were becoming increasingly sinicised and faced with the Russian threat, they began to encourage Han Chinese farmers to settle in both Mongolia and Manchuria. This policy was followed by subsequent governments. The railroads that were being built in these regions were especially useful to the Han Chinese settlers. Land was either sold by Mongol Princes, or leased to Han Chinese farmers, or simply taken away from the nomads and given to Han Chinese farmers.\n\n\nA group of Han Chinese during the Qing dynasty called \"Mongol followers\" immigrated to Inner Mongolia who worked as servants for Mongols and Mongol princes and married Mongol women. Their descendants continued to marry Mongol women and changed their ethnicity to Mongol as they assimilated into the Mongol people, an example of this were the ancestors of Li Shouxin. They distinguished themselves apart from \"true Mongols\" 真蒙古.[18][19][20]\n\n\n\n### Republic of China and the Second World War periods[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mongolia (1911–24), Inner Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Mengjiang, and Mongol United Autonomous Government\n\n![](image)Mongols stand in front of a yurt, 1912\nOuter Mongolia gained independence from the Qing dynasty in 1911, when the Jebtsundamba Khutugtu of the Khalkha was declared the Bogd Khan of Mongolia. Although almost all banners of Inner Mongolia recognised the Bogd Khan as the supreme ruler of Mongols, the internal strife within the region prevented a full reunification. The Mongol rebellions in Inner Mongolia were counterbalanced by princes who hoped to see a restored Qing dynasty in Manchuria and Mongolia, as they considered the theocratic rule of the Bogd Khan would be against their modernising objectives for Mongolia.[21] Eventually, the newly formed Republic of China promised a new nation of five races (Han, Manchu, Mongol, Tibetan and Uyghur).[22] and suppressed the Mongol rebellions in the area.[23][24]\n\n\nThe Republic of China reorganised Inner Mongolia into provinces:\n\n\n\n* Rehe province was created to include the Juuuda and Josutu leagues, plus the Chengde area in what is now northern Hebei.\n* Chahar province was created to include Xilingol league as well as much of the former territory of the Eight Banners.\n* Suiyuan province was created to include Ulanqab league, Yekejuu league, and the Hetao region (former Guihua Tümed territory).\n* Hulunbuir stayed within Heilongjiang in Manchuria, which had become a province.\n* Most of Jirim league came under the new province of Fengtian in southern Manchuria.\n* Taoxi Mongolia, i.e., Alashan and Ejine leagues, was incorporated into neighbouring Gansu province. Later on Ningxia province was split out of northern Gansu, and Taoxi Mongolia became part of Ningxia.\n\n\nSome Republic of China maps still show this structure.\n\n\nThe history of Inner Mongolia during the Second World War is complicated, with Japanese invasion and different kinds of resistance movements. In 1931, Manchuria came under the control of the Japanese puppet state Manchukuo, taking some Mongol areas in the Manchurian provinces (i.e., Hulunbuir and Jirim leagues) along. Rehe was also incorporated into Manchukuo in 1933, taking Juu Uda and Josutu leagues along with it. These areas were occupied by Manchukuo until the end of World War II in 1945.\n\n\nIn 1937, the Empire of Japan openly and fully invaded Republic of China. On 8 December 1937, Mongolian Prince Demchugdongrub (also known as \"De Wang\") declared independence for the remaining parts of Inner Mongolia (i.e., the Suiyuan and Chahar provinces) as Mengjiang, and signed agreements with Manchukuo and Japan. Its capital was established at Zhangbei (now in Hebei province), with the Japanese puppet government's control extending as far west as the Hohhot region. The Japanese advance was defeated by Hui Muslim General Ma Hongbin at the Battle of West Suiyuan and Battle of Wuyuan. Since 1945, Inner Mongolia has remained part of China.\n\n\nThe Mongol Ulanhu fought against the Japanese.\n\n\n\n![](image)Delegates of Inner Mongolia People's Congress shouting slogans\nEthnic Mongolian guerrilla units were created by the Kuomintang Nationalists to fight against the Japanese during the war in the late 30s and early 40s. These Mongol militias were created by the Ejine and Alashaa based commissioner's offices created by the Kuomintang.[25][26] Prince Demchugdongrob's Mongols were targeted by Kuomintang Mongols to defect to the Republic of China. The Nationalists recruited 1,700 ethnic minority fighters in Inner Mongolia and created war zones in the Tumet Banner, Ulanchab League, and Ordos Yekejuu League.[25][27]\n\n\nThe Inner Mongolian People's Republic was founded shortly after the Second World War. It existed from 9 September 1945 until 6 November 1945.\n\n\n\n### People's Republic of China[edit]\n\n\nThe Communist movement gradually gained momentum as part of the Third Communist International in Inner Mongolia during the Japanese period. By the end of WWII, the Inner Mongolian faction of the ComIntern had a functional militia and actively opposed the attempts at independence by De Wang's Chinggisid princes on the grounds of fighting feudalism. Following the end of World War II, the Chinese Communists gained control of Manchuria as well as the Inner Mongolian Communists with decisive Soviet support and established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947. The Comintern army was absorbed into the People's Liberation Army. Initially, the autonomous region included just the Hulunbuir region. Over the next decade, as the communists established the People's Republic of China and consolidated control over mainland China, Inner Mongolia was expanded westwards to include five of the six original leagues (except Josutu League, which remains in Liaoning province), the northern part of the Chahar region, by then a league as well (southern Chahar remains in Hebei province), the Hetao region, and the Alashan and Ejine banners. Eventually, nearly all areas with sizeable Mongol populations were incorporated into the region, giving present-day Inner Mongolia its elongated shape. The leader of Inner Mongolia during that time, as both regional CPC secretary and head of regional government, was Ulanhu.\n\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the administration of Ulanhu was purged, and a wave of repressions was initiated against the Mongol population of the autonomous region.[28] Among the victims in Inner Mongolia, 75 per cent were Mongols, even though they only constituted 10 per cent of the population.[29] In 1969, much of Inner Mongolia was distributed among surrounding provinces, with Hulunbuir divided between Heilongjiang and Jilin, Jirim going to Jilin, Juu Uda to Liaoning, and the Alashan and Ejine region divided among Gansu and Ningxia. This decision was reversed in 1979.\n\n\nInner Mongolia has seen considerable development since Deng Xiaoping instituted Chinese economic reform in 1978. For about ten years since 2000, Inner Mongolia's GDP growth has been the highest in the country, (along with Guangdong) largely owing to the success of natural resource industries in the region. GDP growth has continually been over 10%, even 15% and connections with the Wolf Economy to the north has helped development. However, growth has come at a cost with huge amounts of pollution and degradation to the grasslands.[30] Attempts to attract ethnic Chinese to migrate from other regions, as well as urbanise those rural nomads and peasants has led to huge amounts of corruption and waste in public spending, such as Ordos City.[31][32] Acute uneven wealth distribution has further exacerbated ethnic tensions, many indigenous Mongolians feeling they are increasingly marginalised in their own homeland, leading to riots in 2011 and 2013.[33][34]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2020, large protests broke out in ethnic Mongol communities due to unannounced plans by the Chinese government to phase out Mongolian-medium teaching.[35][36][37]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Inner Mongolian steppes\n![](image)Topography of Inner Mongolia in China\nOfficially Inner Mongolia is classified as one of the provincial-level divisions of North China, but its great stretch means that parts of it belong to Northeast China and Northwest China as well. It borders eight provincial-level divisions in all three of the aforementioned regions (Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Gansu), tying with Shaanxi for the greatest number of bordering provincial-level divisions. Most of its international border is with Mongolia,[note 3] which, in Chinese, is sometimes called \"Outer Mongolia\", while a small portion is with Russia's Zabaykalsky Krai.\n\n\nInner Mongolia largely consists of the northern side of the North China Craton, a tilted and sedimented Precambrian block. In the extreme southwest is the edge of the Tibetan Plateau where the autonomous region's highest peak, Main Peak in the Helan Mountains reaches 3,556 metres (11,670 ft), and is still being pushed up today in short bursts.[2] Most of Inner Mongolia is a plateau averaging around 1,200 metres (3,940 ft) in altitude and covered by extensive loess and sand deposits. The northern part consists of the Mesozoic era Khingan Mountains, and is owing to the cooler climate more forested, chiefly with Manchurian elm, ash, birch, Mongolian oak and a number of pine and spruce species. Where discontinuous permafrost is present north of Hailar District, forests are almost exclusively coniferous. In the south, the natural vegetation is grassland in the east and very sparse in the arid west, and grazing is the dominant economic activity.\n\n\nOwing to the ancient, weathered rocks lying under its deep sedimentary cover, Inner Mongolia is a major mining district, possessing large reserves of coal, iron ore and rare-earth minerals, which have made it a major industrial region today.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Winter in Ulanbutan Grassland, Hexigten Banner\nDue to its elongated shape, Inner Mongolia has a four-season monsoon climate with regional variations. The winters in Inner Mongolia are very long, cold, and dry with frequent blizzards, though snowfall is so light that Inner Mongolia has no modern glaciers[2] even on the highest Helan peaks. The spring is short, mild and arid, with large, dangerous sandstorms, whilst the summer is very warm to hot and relatively humid except in the west where it remains dry. Autumn is brief and sees a steady cooling, with temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) reached in October in the north and November in the south.\n\n\nOfficially, most of Inner Mongolia is classified as either a cold arid or steppe regime (Köppen *BWk, BSk*, respectively). The small portion besides these are classified as humid continental (Köppen *Dwa/Dwb*) in the northeast, or subarctic (Köppen *Dwc*) in the far north near Hulunbuir.[38]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Average daily maximum and minimum temperatures for some locations in Inner Mongolia of China**\n| City\n | July (°C)\n | July (°F)\n | January (°C)\n | January (°F)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Baotou | 29.6/17.1 | 85.3/62.8 | −4.1/–16.8 | 24.7/1.8\n |\n| Bayannur | 30.7/17.9 | 87.3/64.2 | −3.3/–15.1 | 26.1/4.8\n |\n| Hohhot | 28.5/16.4 | 83.3/61.5 | −5/–16.9 | 23/1.6\n |\n| Ordos | 26.7/15.8 | 80.1/60.4 | −4.8/–14.7 | 23.4/5.5\n |\n| Ulanqab | 25.4/13.6 | 77.7/56.5 | −6.1/–18.5 | 21/–1.3\n |\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Inner Mongolia and List of township-level divisions of Inner Mongolia.\n\nInner Mongolia is divided into twelve prefecture-level divisions. Until the late 1990s, most of Inner Mongolia's prefectural regions were known as *Leagues* (Chinese: 盟), a usage retained from Mongol divisions of the Qing dynasty. Similarly, county-level divisions are often known as *Banners* (Chinese: 旗). Since the 1990s, numerous Leagues have converted into prefecture-level cities, although Banners remain. The restructuring led to the conversion of primate cities in most leagues to convert to districts administratively (i.e.: Hailar, Jining and Dongsheng). Some newly founded prefecture-level cities have chosen to retain the original name of League (i.e.: Hulunbuir, Bayannur and Ulanqab), some have adopted the Chinese name of their primate city (Chifeng, Tongliao), and one League (Yekejuu) simply renamed itself Ordos. Despite these recent administrative changes, there is no indication that the Alxa, Hinggan, and Xilingol Leagues will convert to prefecture-level cities in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Administrative divisions of Inner Mongolia\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**↖**\n\n**Hohhot**\n\n**Baotou**\n\n**↗**\n\n**Wuhai**\n\n**Chifeng**\n\n**Tongliao**\n\n**Ordos**\n\n**Hulunbuir**\n\n**Bayannur**\n\n**Ulanqab**\n\n**HingganLeague**\n\n**XilingolLeague**\n\n**AlxaLeague**\n\n**█** **Jiagedaqi Dist. & Songling Dist.is de jure part of Oroqen Aut.

In the more arid grasslands, herding of goats, sheep and so on is a traditional method of subsistence. Forestry and hunting are somewhat important in the Greater Khingan ranges in the east. Reindeer herding is carried out by Evenks in the Evenk Autonomous Banner. More recently, growing grapes and winemaking have become an economic factor in the Wuhai area.\n\n\n\n![](image)Theater in Hohhot\nInner Mongolia has an abundance of resources especially coal, cashmere, natural gas, rare-earth elements, and has more deposits of naturally occurring niobium, zirconium and beryllium than any other province-level region in China. The region is also a source of crude oil, with sites such as the Xifeng oil field producing tens of thousands of barrels per day.[46] However, in the past, the exploitation and utilisation of resources were rather inefficient, which resulted in poor returns from rich resources. Inner Mongolia is also an important coal production base, with more than a quarter of the world's coal reserves located in the province.[47] It plans to double annual coal output by 2010 (from the 2005 volume of 260 million tons) to 500 million tons of coal a year.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Inner Mongolia Gymnasium\nIndustry in Inner Mongolia has grown up mainly around coal, power generation, forestry-related industries, and related industries.\nInner Mongolia now encourages six competitive industries: energy, chemicals, metallurgy, equipment manufacturing, processing of farm (including dairy) produce, and high technology. Well-known Inner Mongolian enterprises include companies such as ERDOS, Yili, and Mengniu. As with much of China, economic growth has led to a boom in construction, including new commercial development and large apartment complexes.\n\n\nThe GDP of Inner Mongolia in 2022 was CN¥2.3 trillion (US$344 billion in nominal),[5] with an average annual increase of 10% from the period 2010–2015. Its per capita GDP was CN¥96,474 (US$14,343 in nominal), ranking 8th among all the 31 provincial divisions of China.[5] The primary, secondary and tertiary industries contributed ¥265 billion ($39.45 billion), ¥1.12 trillion ($167.1 billion) and ¥926 billion ($137.7 billion) to the GDP respectively.[5]\n\n\nIn addition to its large reserves of natural resources, Inner Mongolia also has the largest usable wind power capacity in China[47] thanks to strong winds which develop in the province's grasslands. Some private companies have set up wind parks in parts of Inner Mongolia such as Bailingmiao, Hutengliang and Zhouzi.\n\n\nEast of Jilantai, Inner Mongolia, there is a ballistic missile training area used by the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) to train missile crews for mobile missile launchers, their support vehicles, and silo-based ballistic missiles.[49]\n\n\n\n### Economic and Technological Development Zones[edit]\n\n\n* Baotou National Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone[50]\n* Erenhot Border Economic Cooperation Area\n* Hohhot Export Processing Zone\n\n\nHohhot Export Processing Zone was established 21 June 2002 by the State Council, which is located in the west of the Hohhot, with a planning area of 2.2 km2 (0.85 sq mi).

Autonomous regions have more discretion in administering economic policy in the region in accordance with national guidelines. Structurally, the Chairman—who legally must be an ethnic minority and is usually ethnic Mongolian—is always kept in check by the Communist Party Regional Committee Secretary, who is usually from a different part of China (to reduce corruption) and Han Chinese. As of May 2023[update], the current party secretary is Sun Shaocheng. The Inner Mongolian government and its subsidiaries follow roughly the same structure as that of a Chinese province. With regards to economic policy, as a part of increased federalism characteristics in China, Inner Mongolia has become more independent in implementing its own economic roadmap.\n\n\nThe position of Chairman of Inner Mongolia alternates between Khorchin Mongols in the east and the Tumed Mongols in the west.[*citation needed*] Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, this convention has not been broken. The family of Ulanhu has retained influence in regional politics ever since the founding the People's Republic. His son Buhe and granddaughter Bu Xiaolin both served as Chairman of the region.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mongols § Subgroups, Mongols in China, and List of ethnic groups in China\n\n![](image)Muslim-themed Street in Hohhot\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1954[52] | 6,100,104 | —     |\n| 1964[53] | 12,348,638 | +7.31% |\n| 1982[54] | 19,274,279 | +2.50% |\n| 1990[55] | 21,456,798 | +1.35% |\n| 2000[56] | 23,323,347 | +0.84% |\n| 2010[57] | 24,706,321 | +0.58% |\n| 2020[58] | 24,049,155 | −0.27% |\n| Established in 1947 from dissolution of Xing'an Province, Qahar Province, parts of Rehe Province, and Suiyuan Province; parts of Ningxia Province were incorporated into Inner Mongolia AR. |\n\n\nWhen the autonomous region was established in 1947, Han Chinese comprised 83.6% of the population, while the Mongols comprised 14.8% of the population.[59] By 2020, the percentage of Han Chinese had dropped to 78.7%. While the Hetao region along the Yellow River has always alternated between farmers from the south and nomads from the north, the most recent wave of Han Chinese migration began in the early 18th century with encouragement from the Qing dynasty, and continued into the 20th century. Han Chinese live mostly in the Hetao region as well as various population centres in central and eastern Inner Mongolia. Over 70% of Mongols are concentrated in less than 18% of Inner Mongolia's territory (Hinggan League, and the prefectures of Tongliao and Chifeng).\n\n\nMongols are the second largest ethnic group, comprising 17.7% of the population as of the 2020 census.[60] They include many diverse Mongolian-speaking groups; groups such as the Buryats and the Oirats are also officially considered to be Mongols in China. In addition to the Manchus, other Tungusic ethnic groups, the Oroqen, and the Evenks also populate parts of northeastern Inner Mongolia. There is also a significant number of Hui and Koreans.\n\n\nMany of the traditionally nomadic Mongols have settled in permanent homes as their pastoral economy was collectivised during the Mao era, and some have taken jobs in cities as migrant labourers; however, some Mongols continue in their nomadic tradition. In practice, highly educated Mongols tend to migrate to big urban centers after which they become essentially indistinct with ethnic Han Chinese populations.\n\n\nInter-marriage between Mongol and non-Mongol populations is very common, particularly in areas where Mongols are in regular contact with other groups. There was little cultural stigma within Mongol families for marrying outside the ethnic group, and in urban centers in particular, Mongol men and women married non-Mongols at relatively similar rates. The rates of intermarriage stands in very sharp contrast to ethnic Tibetans and Uyghurs in their respective autonomous regions. By the 1980s, for instance, in the former Jirim League, nearly 40% of marriages with at least one Mongol spouse was a mixed Mongol-Han Chinese marriage.[61] However, anecdotal reports have also demonstrated an increase in Mongol-female, Han Chinese-male pairings in which the woman is of a rural background, ostensibly shutting rural Mongol males from the marriage market as the sex ratio in China becomes more skewed with a much higher proportion of men.[62]\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnic groups in Inner Mongolia, 2010 census[63]\n| Ethnicity | Population | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Han | 19,650,687 | 79.54%\n |\n| Mongol | 4,226,093 | 17.11%\n |\n| Manchu | 452,765 | 1.83%\n |\n| Daur | 121,483 | 0.49%\n |\n| Evenks | 26,139 | 0.11%\n |\n| Oroqen people | 8,464 | 0.07%\n |\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Population\n | Han Chinese | Mongol | Manchu |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1953[64] | 6,100,104\n | 5,119,928\n | 83.9%\n | 888,235\n | 14.6%\n | 18,354\n | 0.3%\n |\n| 1964[64] | 12,348,638\n | 10,743,456\n | 87.0%\n | 1,384,535\n | 11.2%\n | 50,960\n | 0.4%\n |\n| 1982[64] | 19,274,281\n | 16,277,616\n | 84.4%\n | 2,489,378\n | 12.9%\n | 237,149\n | 1.2%\n |\n| 1990[65] | 21,456,500\n | 17,290,000\n | 80.6%\n | 3,379,700\n | 15.8%\n |  |  |\n| 2000[66] | 23,323,347\n | 18,465,586\n | 79.2%\n | 3,995,349\n | 17.1%\n | 499,911\n | 2.3%\n |\n| 2010[67] | 24,706,321\n | 19,650,687\n | 79.5%\n | 4,226,093\n | 17.1%\n | 452,765\n | 1.83%\n |\n| 2020[60] | 24,049,155\n | 18,935,537\n | 78.7%\n | 4,247,815\n | 17.7%\n |  |  |\n\n\n\n\nTerritories with Mongol majorities and near-majorities[*citation needed*]\n| Name of banner | Mongol population | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Horqin Right Middle Banner, Hinggan (2020)[68] | 221,258 | 86.6%\n |\n| New Barag Right Banner, Hulunbuir (2009) | 28,369 | 82.2%\n |\n| Horqin Left Back Banner, Tongliao | 284,000 | 75%\n |\n| New Barag Left Banner, Hulunbuir (2009) | 31,531 | 74.9%\n |\n| Horqin Left Middle Banner, Tongliao | 395,000 | 73.5%\n |\n| East Ujimqin Banner, Xilingol (2009) | 43,394 | 72.5%\n |\n| West Ujimqin Banner, Xilingol | 57,000 | 65%\n |\n| Sonid Left Banner, Xilingol (2006) | 20,987 | 62.6%\n |\n| Bordered Yellow Banner, Xilingol | 19,000 | 62%\n |\n| Hure Banner, Tongliao | 93,000 | 56%\n |\n| Jarud Banner, Tongliao | 144,000 | 48%\n |\n| Horqin Right Front Banner, Hinggan | 162,000 | 45%\n |\n| Old Barag Banner, Hulunbuir (2006) | 25,903 | 43.6%\n |\n| Jalaid Banner, Hinggan | 158,000 | 39%\n |\n| Ar Khorchin Banner, Chifeng (2002) | 108,000 | 36.6%\n |\n\n\n*Population numbers exclude members of the People's Liberation Army in active service based in Inner Mongolia.*\n\n\n\n## Language and culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Culture of Mongolia, Music of Mongolia, Music of Inner Mongolia, and Mongolian language in Inner Mongolia\n\n![](image)A KFC in Hohhot, the capital, with a bilingual street sign in Chinese and Mongolian\n![](image)Inner Mongolian carpet c. 1870\n![](image)Jade dragon of the Hongshan culture (4700 BC – 2900 BC) found in Ongniud Banner, Chifeng\nAlongside Chinese, Mongolian is the official provincial language of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where there are at least 4.1 million ethnic Mongols.[69] Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate)[70] However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in China, specifically in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012.[71] However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanised Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities.[72] The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language.[73][74] Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols.[70][75] The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.[76]\n\n\nBy law, all street signs, commercial outlets, and government documents must be bilingual, written in both Mongolian and Chinese. There are three Mongolian TV channels in the Inner Mongolia Satellite TV network. In public transportation, all announcements are to be bilingual.\n\n\nMongols in Inner Mongolia speak Mongolian dialects such as Chakhar, Xilingol, Baarin, Khorchin and Kharchin Mongolian and, depending on definition and analysis, further dialects[77] or closely related independent Central Mongolic languages[78] such as Ordos, Khamnigan, Barghu Buryat and the arguably Oirat dialect Alasha. The standard pronunciation of Mongolian in China is based on the Chakhar dialect of the Plain Blue Banner, located in central Inner Mongolia, while the grammar is based on all Inner Mongolian dialects.[79] This is different from the Mongolian state, where the standard pronunciation is based on the closely related Khalkha dialect. There are a number of independent languages spoken in Hulunbuir such as the somewhat more distant Mongolic language Dagur and the Tungusic language Evenki. Officially, even the Evenki dialect Oroqin is considered a language.[80]\n\n\nThe Han Chinese of Inner Mongolia speak a variety of dialects, depending on the region. Those in the eastern parts tend to speak Northeastern Mandarin, which belongs to the Mandarin group of dialects; those in the central parts, such as the Yellow River valley, speak varieties of Jin, another subdivision of Chinese, due to its proximity to other Jin-speaking areas in China such as the Shanxi province. Cities such as Hohhot and Baotou both have their unique brand of Jin Chinese such as the Zhangjiakou–Hohhot dialect which are sometimes incomprehensible with dialects spoken in northeastern regions such as Hailar.\n\n\nThe vast grasslands have long symbolised Inner Mongolia. Mongolian art often depicts the grassland in an uplifting fashion and emphasises Mongolian nomadic traditions. The Mongols of Inner Mongolia still practice their traditional arts. Inner Mongolian cuisine has Mongol roots and consists of dairy-related products and *hand-held lamb* (手扒肉). In recent years, franchises based on hot pot have appeared in Inner Mongolia, the best known of which is Little Sheep. Notable Inner Mongolian commercial brand names include Mengniu and Yili, both of which began as dairy product and ice cream producers.\n\n\nAmong the Han Chinese of Inner Mongolia, Shanxi opera is a popular traditional form of entertainment. See also: Shanxi. A popular career in Inner Mongolia is circus acrobatics. The internationally known Inner Mongolia Acrobatic Troupe travels and performs with the renowned Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Inner Mongolia\n\n| Religion in Inner Mongolia (2005–2010) |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| Chinese, Han Buddhism and Mongolian folk religion(worship of Heaven and ovoo/aobao) |  | 80% |\n| Tibetan Buddhism |  | 12.0% |\n| Chinese ancestral religion |  | 2.35% |\n| Christianity |  | 2.0% |\n| Islam |  | 1.0% |\n\n![](image)Temple of the White Sulde of Genghis Khan in the town of Uxin in Inner Mongolia, in the Mu Us Desert. The worship of Genghis is shared by Chinese and Mongolian folk religion.[note 4]\nAccording to a survey held in 2004 by the Minzu University of China, about 80% of the population of the region practice the worship of Heaven (that is named *Tian* in the Chinese tradition and *Tenger* in the Mongolian tradition) and of *ovoo/aobao*.[81]\n\n\nOfficial statistics report that 10.9% of the population (3 million people) are members of Tibetan Buddhist groups.[82] According to the Chinese Spiritual Life Survey of 2007 and the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christianity is the religious identity of 3.2% of the population of the region; and Chinese ancestral religion the professed belonging of 2.36%,[83] while a demographic analysis of the year 2010 reported that Muslims comprise the 0.91%.[84]\n\n\nThe cult of Genghis Khan, present in the form of various Genghis Khan temples, is a tradition of Mongolian shamanism, in which he is considered a cultural hero and divine ancestor, an embodiment of the *Tenger* (Heaven, God of Heaven).[85] His worship in special temples, greatly developed in Inner Mongolia since the 1980s, is also shared by the Han Chinese, claiming his spirit as the founding principle of the Yuan dynasty.[86]\n\n\nTibetan Buddhism (Mongolian Buddhism, locally also known as \"Yellow Buddhism\") is the dominant form of Buddhism in Inner Mongolia, also practised by many Han Chinese. Another form of Buddhism, practised by the Chinese, are the schools of Chinese Buddhism.\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\nIn the capital city Hohhot:\n\n\n\n* Da Zhao Temple is a Buddhist temple built in 1580.

It was founded in 1958, making it the PRC's first launch facility. As of 2021, Jiuquan has documented more launches than any other launch facilities in China, and is still the only launch site for crewed space missions (Shenzhou program). While geologically located inside Inner Mongolia, the launch center is named after Jiuquan, which is the nearest urban center in the nearby province of Gansu. As military facilities, the core areas at Jiuquan Center are highly restricted and can only be visited by tourist buses operated by the center, while the visitor center is open to the public and can be accessed from the south gate.\n\n\nInner Mongolia is also home to the two (and only two) space vehicles landing sites in China, the Siziwang Banner Landing Site in Ulanqab and the Dongfeng Landing Site in Alxa.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n### Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of universities and colleges in Inner Mongolia\n\n### Language policy and protest[edit]\n\n\nInner Mongolia under the People's Republic of China has historically allowed the Mongolian language as a medium of instruction. An 1979 article from the *People's Daily* praises the re-establishment of Mongolian-language education after \"interference and vandalism by the Gang of Four\" during the Cultural Revolution.[87]\n\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Inner Mongolia protests\n\nIt was reported by *The New York Times* on 31 August 2020 that in the summer 2020, the Chinese government announced a new education policy, which called for Chinese to gradually replace Mongolian as the language of instruction in three subjects, including language and literature, politics, and history, in elementary and middle schools around the Inner Mongolia region. Thousands of ethnic Mongolians in northern China gathered to protest the policy.[88]\n\n\n\n## Image gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Ulaanbutan grassland](image)\n\nUlaanbutan grassland\n* ![Inner Mongolian grassland](image)\n\nInner Mongolian grassland\n* ![Helan Mountains scenery](image)\n\nHelan Mountains scenery\n* ![Khitan people cooking.

When we compare this final statistic with Minzu University research team's finding that **80% of the inhabitants of Inner Mongolia** worship* Tian *(loosely translated \"Heaven\") and* aobao *(traditional stone structures that serve as altars for sacrifice), it is evident that the official calculations of registered religious believers are markedly low, and the policy decisions based on these numbers lack the necessary grounding in reality.* [...] *Foreign religions can be transformed into indigenous ethnic religions, and the traditional folk religions of China's ethnic minorities can integrate and neutralize non-native religions. Thus, China's ethnic religions should not be regarded as social burdens or challenges, but rather as valuable cultural assets.*»\n82. **^** Wu, Jiayu; Fang, Yong (January 2016). \"Study on the Protection of the Lama Temple Heritage in Inner Mongolia as a Cultural Landscape\". *Journal of Asian Architecture and Building Engineering*. **15** (1): 9–16. doi:10.3130/jaabe.15.9.

Its border includes two-thirds of the length of China's border with the country of Mongolia. Inner Mongolia also accounts for a small section of China's border with Russia (Zabaykalsky Krai). Its capital is Hohhot; other major cities include Baotou, Chifeng, Tongliao, and Ordos.\n\n\nThe autonomous region was established in 1947, incorporating the areas of the former Republic of China provinces of Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, Liaobei, and Xing'an, along with the northern parts of Gansu and Ningxia.\n\n\nIts area makes it the third largest Chinese administrative subdivision, constituting approximately 1,200,000 km2 (463,000 sq mi) and 12% of China's total land area. Due to its long span from east to west, Inner Mongolia is geographically divided into eastern and western divisions. The eastern division is often included in Northeastern China (Dongbei), with major cities including Tongliao, Chifeng, Hailar, and Ulanhot. The western division is included in North China, with major cities including Baotou and Hohhot. It recorded a population of 24,706,321 in the 2010 census, accounting for 1.84% of Mainland China's total population. Inner Mongolia is the country's 23rd most populous province-level division.[8] The majority of the population in the region are Han Chinese, with a sizeable Mongol minority close to 5,000,000 (2019) which is the largest Mongolian population in the world (bigger than that of the country Mongolia). Inner Mongolia is one of the more economically developed provinces in China with annual GDP per capita at US$14,343 (2022), ranked 8th in the nation. The official languages are Mandarin and Mongolian, the latter of which is written in the traditional Mongolian script, as opposed to the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet, which is used in the country of Mongolia (formerly often described as Outer Mongolia).\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **possibly contains original research**.

Mongolian *dotugadu*/*gadagadu*). Inner Mongolia is distinct from Outer Mongolia, which was a term used by the Republic of China and previous governments to refer to what is now the independent state of Mongolia and the Republic of Tuva in Russia. The term Inner 内 (Nei) referred to the Nei Fan 内藩 (Inner Tributary), i.e., those descendants of Genghis Khan who were granted the title khan (king) in the Ming and Qing dynasties and lived in part of southern Mongolia. The region is sometimes called Southern Mongolia by local separatists and Mongolian irredentists.[9]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Mongolia\n\nMuch of what is known about the history of the Mongolian Plateau is taken from Chinese chronicles and historians. Before the rise of the Mongols in the 13th century, what is now central and western Inner Mongolia, especially the Hetao region, alternated in control between Chinese agriculturalists in the south, and Xiongnu, Xianbei, Khitan, Jurchen, Tujue, and nomadic Mongol of the north. The historical narrative of what is now Eastern Inner Mongolia mostly consists of alternations between different Tungusic and Mongol tribes, rather than the struggle between nomads and Chinese agriculturalists.\n\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Han dynasty in Inner Asia and Tang dynasty in Inner Asia\n\nSlab Grave cultural monuments are found in Northern, Central and Eastern Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, North-Western China, Southern, Central-Eastern and Southern Baikal territory. Mongolian scholars prove that this culture related to the Proto-Mongols.[10]\n\n\nDuring the Zhou dynasty, Central and Western Inner Mongolia (the Hetao region and surrounding areas) were inhabited by nomadic peoples such as the Loufan, Linhu and Dí, while Eastern Inner Mongolia was inhabited by the Donghu. During the Warring States period, King Wuling (340–295 BC) of the state of Zhao based in what is now Hebei and Shanxi Provinces pursued an expansionist policy towards the region. After destroying the Dí state of Zhongshan in what is now Hebei province, he defeated the Linhu and Loufan and created the Yunzhong Commandery near modern Hohhot. King Wuling of Zhao also built a long wall stretching through the Hetao region. After Qin Shi Huang created the first unified Chinese empire in 221 BC, he sent the general Meng Tian to drive the Xiongnu from the region and incorporated the old Zhao wall into the Qin dynasty Great Wall of China. He also maintained two commanderies in the region: Jiuyuan and Yunzhong and moved 30,000 households there to solidify the region. After the Qin dynasty collapsed in 206 BC, these efforts were abandoned.[11]\n\n\nDuring the Western Han dynasty, Emperor Wu sent the general Wei Qing to reconquer the Hetao region from the Xiongnu in 127 BC. After the conquest, Emperor Wu continued the policy of building settlements in Hetao to defend against the Xiong-Nu. In that same year, he established the commanderies of Shuofang and Wuyuan in Hetao. At the same time, what is now Eastern Inner Mongolia was controlled by the Xianbei, who would, later on, eclipse the Xiongnu in power and influence.\n\n\nDuring the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 AD), Xiongnu who surrendered to the Han dynasty began to be settled in Hetao and intermingled with the Han immigrants in the area. Later on, during the Western Jin dynasty, it was a Xiongnu noble from Hetao, Liu Yuan, who established the Han Zhao kingdom in the region, thereby beginning the Sixteen Kingdoms period that saw the disintegration of northern China under a variety of Han and non-Han (including Xiongnu and Xianbei) regimes.\n\n\nThe Sui dynasty (581–618) and Tang dynasty (618–907) re-established a unified Chinese empire and like their predecessors, they conquered and settled people into Hetao, though once again these efforts were aborted when the Tang empire began to collapse. Hetao (along with the rest of what now consists Inner Mongolia) was then taken over by the Liao dynasty founded by the Khitans, a nomadic people originally from what is now the southern part of Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia. They were followed by the Western Xia of the Tanguts, who took control of what is now the western part of Inner Mongolia (including Western Hetao). The Khitans were later replaced by the Jurchens, precursors to the modern Manchus, who established the Jin dynasty over Manchuria and Northern China.\n\n\n\n### Mongol and Ming periods[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mongol Empire, Mongolia under Yuan rule, Northern Yuan, and Ming dynasty in Inner Asia\n\n![](image)Persian miniature depicting Genghis Khan entering Beijing\n![](image)The Northern Yuan at its greatest extent\nAfter Genghis Khan unified the Mongol tribes in 1206 and founded the Mongol Empire, the Tangut Western Xia empire was ultimately conquered in 1227, and the Jurchen Jin dynasty fell in 1234. In 1271, Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan established the Yuan dynasty. Kublai Khan's summer capital Shangdu (aka Xanadu) was located near present-day Dolonnor. During that time Ongud and Khunggirad peoples dominated the area of what is now Inner Mongolia. After the Yuan dynasty was overthrown by the Han-led Ming dynasty in 1368, the Ming captured parts of Inner Mongolia including Shangdu and Yingchang. The Ming rebuilt the Great Wall of China at its present location, which roughly follows the southern border of the modern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (though it deviates significantly at the Hebei-Inner Mongolia border). The Ming established the Three Guards composed of the Mongols there. Soon after the Tumu incident in 1449, when the Oirat ruler Esen taishi captured the Chinese emperor, Mongols flooded south from Outer Mongolia to Inner Mongolia. Thus from then on until 1635, Inner Mongolia was the political and cultural center of the Mongols during the Northern Yuan dynasty.[12]\n\n\n\n### Qing period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mongolia under Qing rule\n\nThe eastern Mongol tribes near and in Manchuria, particularly the Khorchin and Southern Khalkha in today's Inner Mongolia intermarried, formed alliances with, and fought against the Jurchen tribes until Nurhaci, the founder of the new Jin dynasty, consolidated his control over all groups in the area in 1593.[13] The Manchus gained far-reaching control of the Inner Mongolian tribes in 1635, when Ligden Khan's son surrendered the Chakhar Mongol tribes to the Manchus. The Manchus subsequently invaded Ming China in 1644, bringing it under the control of their newly established Qing dynasty. Under the Qing dynasty (1636–1912), the Mongolian Plateau was administered in a different way for each region:\n\n\n\n![](image)Mongolia plateau during early 17th century\n![](image)Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia within the Qing dynasty, c. 1820\n* \"Outer Mongolia\": This region corresponds to the modern state of Mongolia, plus the Russian-administered region of Tannu Uriankhai, and a part of northern Xinjiang. It included the four leagues (*aimag*) of the Khalkha Mongols north of the Gobi, as well as the Tannu Uriankhai and Khovd regions in northwestern Mongolia, which were overseen by the General of Uliastai from the city of Uliastai.\n* \"Inner Mongolia\": This region corresponded to most of modern Inner Mongolia and some neighbouring areas in Liaoning and Jilin provinces. The banners and tribes in this region came under six leagues (*chuulghan*): Jirim, Juuuda, Josutu, Xilingol, Ulanqab, and Yekejuu.\n* \"Taoxi Mongolia\": The Alashan Öölüd and Ejine Torghuud banners were separate from the aimags of Outer Mongolia and the chuulghans of Inner Mongolia. This territory is equivalent to modern-day Alxa League, the westernmost part of what is now Inner Mongolia.\n* The Chahar Banners were controlled by the military commander of Chahar (now Zhangjiakou). Their extent corresponded to southern Ulanqab and Bayannur in modern Inner Mongolia, plus the region around Zhangjiakou in Hebei province. At the same time, the jurisdiction of some border departments of Zhili and Shanxi provinces also belonged to this region.\n* The Guihua Tümed banner was controlled by the military commander of Suiyuan (now Hohhot). This corresponds to the vicinities of the modern city of Hohhot. At the same time, the jurisdiction of some border departments of modern Shanxi province also belonged to this region.\n* The Hulunbuir region in what is now northeastern Inner Mongolia was part of the jurisdiction of the General of Heilongjiang, one of the three generals of Manchuria.\n\n\nThe Inner Mongolian Chahar leader Ligdan Khan, a descendant of Genghis Khan, opposed and fought against the Qing until he died of smallpox in 1634. Thereafter, the Inner Mongols under his son Ejei Khan surrendered to the Qing. Ejei Khan was given the title of Prince (親王; *qīn wáng*), and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrest in 1669 in Shenyang and the Kangxi Emperor gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, with 3,000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt. The revolt was put down within two months, the Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on 20 April 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. The Chahar Mongols were then put under the direct control of the Qing Emperor, unlike the other Inner Mongol leagues which maintained their autonomy.\n\n\nDespite officially prohibiting Han Chinese settlement on the Manchu and Mongol lands, by the 18th century the Qing decided to settle Han refugees from northern China who were suffering from famine, floods, and drought into Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. As a result, the Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in Manchuria and tens of thousands of hectares in Inner Mongolia by the 1780s.[14]\n\n\nOrdinary Mongols were not allowed to travel outside their own leagues. Mongols were forbidden by the Qing from crossing the borders of their banners, even into other Mongol Banners and from crossing into neidi (the Han Chinese 18 provinces) and were given serious punishments if they did in order to keep the Mongols divided against each other to benefit the Qing.[15] Mongol pilgrims wanting to leave their banner's borders for religious reasons such as pilgrimage had to apply for passports to give them permission.[16]\n\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, growing numbers of Han Chinese settlers had illegally begun to move into the Inner Mongolian steppe. By 1791, there had been so many Han Chinese settlers in the Front Gorlos Banner that the jasak had petitioned the Qing government to legalise the status of the peasants who had already settled there.[17]\n\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, the Manchus were becoming increasingly sinicised and faced with the Russian threat, they began to encourage Han Chinese farmers to settle in both Mongolia and Manchuria. This policy was followed by subsequent governments. The railroads that were being built in these regions were especially useful to the Han Chinese settlers. Land was either sold by Mongol Princes, or leased to Han Chinese farmers, or simply taken away from the nomads and given to Han Chinese farmers.\n\n\nA group of Han Chinese during the Qing dynasty called \"Mongol followers\" immigrated to Inner Mongolia who worked as servants for Mongols and Mongol princes and married Mongol women. Their descendants continued to marry Mongol women and changed their ethnicity to Mongol as they assimilated into the Mongol people, an example of this were the ancestors of Li Shouxin. They distinguished themselves apart from \"true Mongols\" 真蒙古.[18][19][20]\n\n\n\n### Republic of China and the Second World War periods[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mongolia (1911–24), Inner Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Mengjiang, and Mongol United Autonomous Government\n\n![](image)Mongols stand in front of a yurt, 1912\nOuter Mongolia gained independence from the Qing dynasty in 1911, when the Jebtsundamba Khutugtu of the Khalkha was declared the Bogd Khan of Mongolia. Although almost all banners of Inner Mongolia recognised the Bogd Khan as the supreme ruler of Mongols, the internal strife within the region prevented a full reunification. The Mongol rebellions in Inner Mongolia were counterbalanced by princes who hoped to see a restored Qing dynasty in Manchuria and Mongolia, as they considered the theocratic rule of the Bogd Khan would be against their modernising objectives for Mongolia.[21] Eventually, the newly formed Republic of China promised a new nation of five races (Han, Manchu, Mongol, Tibetan and Uyghur).[22] and suppressed the Mongol rebellions in the area.[23][24]\n\n\nThe Republic of China reorganised Inner Mongolia into provinces:\n\n\n\n* Rehe province was created to include the Juuuda and Josutu leagues, plus the Chengde area in what is now northern Hebei.\n* Chahar province was created to include Xilingol league as well as much of the former territory of the Eight Banners.\n* Suiyuan province was created to include Ulanqab league, Yekejuu league, and the Hetao region (former Guihua Tümed territory).\n* Hulunbuir stayed within Heilongjiang in Manchuria, which had become a province.\n* Most of Jirim league came under the new province of Fengtian in southern Manchuria.\n* Taoxi Mongolia, i.e., Alashan and Ejine leagues, was incorporated into neighbouring Gansu province. Later on Ningxia province was split out of northern Gansu, and Taoxi Mongolia became part of Ningxia.\n\n\nSome Republic of China maps still show this structure.\n\n\nThe history of Inner Mongolia during the Second World War is complicated, with Japanese invasion and different kinds of resistance movements. In 1931, Manchuria came under the control of the Japanese puppet state Manchukuo, taking some Mongol areas in the Manchurian provinces (i.e., Hulunbuir and Jirim leagues) along. Rehe was also incorporated into Manchukuo in 1933, taking Juu Uda and Josutu leagues along with it. These areas were occupied by Manchukuo until the end of World War II in 1945.\n\n\nIn 1937, the Empire of Japan openly and fully invaded Republic of China. On 8 December 1937, Mongolian Prince Demchugdongrub (also known as \"De Wang\") declared independence for the remaining parts of Inner Mongolia (i.e., the Suiyuan and Chahar provinces) as Mengjiang, and signed agreements with Manchukuo and Japan. Its capital was established at Zhangbei (now in Hebei province), with the Japanese puppet government's control extending as far west as the Hohhot region. The Japanese advance was defeated by Hui Muslim General Ma Hongbin at the Battle of West Suiyuan and Battle of Wuyuan. Since 1945, Inner Mongolia has remained part of China.\n\n\nThe Mongol Ulanhu fought against the Japanese.\n\n\n\n![](image)Delegates of Inner Mongolia People's Congress shouting slogans\nEthnic Mongolian guerrilla units were created by the Kuomintang Nationalists to fight against the Japanese during the war in the late 30s and early 40s. These Mongol militias were created by the Ejine and Alashaa based commissioner's offices created by the Kuomintang.[25][26] Prince Demchugdongrob's Mongols were targeted by Kuomintang Mongols to defect to the Republic of China. The Nationalists recruited 1,700 ethnic minority fighters in Inner Mongolia and created war zones in the Tumet Banner, Ulanchab League, and Ordos Yekejuu League.[25][27]\n\n\nThe Inner Mongolian People's Republic was founded shortly after the Second World War. It existed from 9 September 1945 until 6 November 1945.\n\n\n\n### People's Republic of China[edit]\n\n\nThe Communist movement gradually gained momentum as part of the Third Communist International in Inner Mongolia during the Japanese period. By the end of WWII, the Inner Mongolian faction of the ComIntern had a functional militia and actively opposed the attempts at independence by De Wang's Chinggisid princes on the grounds of fighting feudalism. Following the end of World War II, the Chinese Communists gained control of Manchuria as well as the Inner Mongolian Communists with decisive Soviet support and established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947. The Comintern army was absorbed into the People's Liberation Army. Initially, the autonomous region included just the Hulunbuir region. Over the next decade, as the communists established the People's Republic of China and consolidated control over mainland China, Inner Mongolia was expanded westwards to include five of the six original leagues (except Josutu League, which remains in Liaoning province), the northern part of the Chahar region, by then a league as well (southern Chahar remains in Hebei province), the Hetao region, and the Alashan and Ejine banners. Eventually, nearly all areas with sizeable Mongol populations were incorporated into the region, giving present-day Inner Mongolia its elongated shape. The leader of Inner Mongolia during that time, as both regional CPC secretary and head of regional government, was Ulanhu.\n\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the administration of Ulanhu was purged, and a wave of repressions was initiated against the Mongol population of the autonomous region.[28] Among the victims in Inner Mongolia, 75 per cent were Mongols, even though they only constituted 10 per cent of the population.[29] In 1969, much of Inner Mongolia was distributed among surrounding provinces, with Hulunbuir divided between Heilongjiang and Jilin, Jirim going to Jilin, Juu Uda to Liaoning, and the Alashan and Ejine region divided among Gansu and Ningxia. This decision was reversed in 1979.\n\n\nInner Mongolia has seen considerable development since Deng Xiaoping instituted Chinese economic reform in 1978. For about ten years since 2000, Inner Mongolia's GDP growth has been the highest in the country, (along with Guangdong) largely owing to the success of natural resource industries in the region. GDP growth has continually been over 10%, even 15% and connections with the Wolf Economy to the north has helped development. However, growth has come at a cost with huge amounts of pollution and degradation to the grasslands.[30] Attempts to attract ethnic Chinese to migrate from other regions, as well as urbanise those rural nomads and peasants has led to huge amounts of corruption and waste in public spending, such as Ordos City.[31][32] Acute uneven wealth distribution has further exacerbated ethnic tensions, many indigenous Mongolians feeling they are increasingly marginalised in their own homeland, leading to riots in 2011 and 2013.[33][34]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2020, large protests broke out in ethnic Mongol communities due to unannounced plans by the Chinese government to phase out Mongolian-medium teaching.[35][36][37]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Inner Mongolian steppes\n![](image)Topography of Inner Mongolia in China\nOfficially Inner Mongolia is classified as one of the provincial-level divisions of North China, but its great stretch means that parts of it belong to Northeast China and Northwest China as well. It borders eight provincial-level divisions in all three of the aforementioned regions (Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Gansu), tying with Shaanxi for the greatest number of bordering provincial-level divisions. Most of its international border is with Mongolia,[note 3] which, in Chinese, is sometimes called \"Outer Mongolia\", while a small portion is with Russia's Zabaykalsky Krai.\n\n\nInner Mongolia largely consists of the northern side of the North China Craton, a tilted and sedimented Precambrian block. In the extreme southwest is the edge of the Tibetan Plateau where the autonomous region's highest peak, Main Peak in the Helan Mountains reaches 3,556 metres (11,670 ft), and is still being pushed up today in short bursts.[2] Most of Inner Mongolia is a plateau averaging around 1,200 metres (3,940 ft) in altitude and covered by extensive loess and sand deposits. The northern part consists of the Mesozoic era Khingan Mountains, and is owing to the cooler climate more forested, chiefly with Manchurian elm, ash, birch, Mongolian oak and a number of pine and spruce species. Where discontinuous permafrost is present north of Hailar District, forests are almost exclusively coniferous. In the south, the natural vegetation is grassland in the east and very sparse in the arid west, and grazing is the dominant economic activity.\n\n\nOwing to the ancient, weathered rocks lying under its deep sedimentary cover, Inner Mongolia is a major mining district, possessing large reserves of coal, iron ore and rare-earth minerals, which have made it a major industrial region today.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Winter in Ulanbutan Grassland, Hexigten Banner\nDue to its elongated shape, Inner Mongolia has a four-season monsoon climate with regional variations. The winters in Inner Mongolia are very long, cold, and dry with frequent blizzards, though snowfall is so light that Inner Mongolia has no modern glaciers[2] even on the highest Helan peaks. The spring is short, mild and arid, with large, dangerous sandstorms, whilst the summer is very warm to hot and relatively humid except in the west where it remains dry. Autumn is brief and sees a steady cooling, with temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) reached in October in the north and November in the south.\n\n\nOfficially, most of Inner Mongolia is classified as either a cold arid or steppe regime (Köppen *BWk, BSk*, respectively). The small portion besides these are classified as humid continental (Köppen *Dwa/Dwb*) in the northeast, or subarctic (Köppen *Dwc*) in the far north near Hulunbuir.[38]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Average daily maximum and minimum temperatures for some locations in Inner Mongolia of China**\n| City\n | July (°C)\n | July (°F)\n | January (°C)\n | January (°F)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Baotou | 29.6/17.1 | 85.3/62.8 | −4.1/–16.8 | 24.7/1.8\n |\n| Bayannur | 30.7/17.9 | 87.3/64.2 | −3.3/–15.1 | 26.1/4.8\n |\n| Hohhot | 28.5/16.4 | 83.3/61.5 | −5/–16.9 | 23/1.6\n |\n| Ordos | 26.7/15.8 | 80.1/60.4 | −4.8/–14.7 | 23.4/5.5\n |\n| Ulanqab | 25.4/13.6 | 77.7/56.5 | −6.1/–18.5 | 21/–1.3\n |\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Inner Mongolia and List of township-level divisions of Inner Mongolia.\n\nInner Mongolia is divided into twelve prefecture-level divisions. Until the late 1990s, most of Inner Mongolia's prefectural regions were known as *Leagues* (Chinese: 盟), a usage retained from Mongol divisions of the Qing dynasty. Similarly, county-level divisions are often known as *Banners* (Chinese: 旗). Since the 1990s, numerous Leagues have converted into prefecture-level cities, although Banners remain. The restructuring led to the conversion of primate cities in most leagues to convert to districts administratively (i.e.: Hailar, Jining and Dongsheng). Some newly founded prefecture-level cities have chosen to retain the original name of League (i.e.: Hulunbuir, Bayannur and Ulanqab), some have adopted the Chinese name of their primate city (Chifeng, Tongliao), and one League (Yekejuu) simply renamed itself Ordos. Despite these recent administrative changes, there is no indication that the Alxa, Hinggan, and Xilingol Leagues will convert to prefecture-level cities in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Administrative divisions of Inner Mongolia\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**↖**\n\n**Hohhot**\n\n**Baotou**\n\n**↗**\n\n**Wuhai**\n\n**Chifeng**\n\n**Tongliao**\n\n**Ordos**\n\n**Hulunbuir**\n\n**Bayannur**\n\n**Ulanqab**\n\n**HingganLeague**\n\n**XilingolLeague**\n\n**AlxaLeague**\n\n**█** **Jiagedaqi Dist. & Songling Dist.is de jure part of Oroqen Aut.

Those are in turn divided into 1425 township-level divisions, including 532 towns, 407 townships, 277 sums, eighteen ethnic townships, one ethnic sum, and 190 subdistricts.

In the more arid grasslands, herding of goats, sheep and so on is a traditional method of subsistence. Forestry and hunting are somewhat important in the Greater Khingan ranges in the east. Reindeer herding is carried out by Evenks in the Evenk Autonomous Banner. More recently, growing grapes and winemaking have become an economic factor in the Wuhai area.\n\n\n\n![](image)Theater in Hohhot\nInner Mongolia has an abundance of resources especially coal, cashmere, natural gas, rare-earth elements, and has more deposits of naturally occurring niobium, zirconium and beryllium than any other province-level region in China. The region is also a source of crude oil, with sites such as the Xifeng oil field producing tens of thousands of barrels per day.[46] However, in the past, the exploitation and utilisation of resources were rather inefficient, which resulted in poor returns from rich resources. Inner Mongolia is also an important coal production base, with more than a quarter of the world's coal reserves located in the province.[47] It plans to double annual coal output by 2010 (from the 2005 volume of 260 million tons) to 500 million tons of coal a year.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Inner Mongolia Gymnasium\nIndustry in Inner Mongolia has grown up mainly around coal, power generation, forestry-related industries, and related industries.\nInner Mongolia now encourages six competitive industries: energy, chemicals, metallurgy, equipment manufacturing, processing of farm (including dairy) produce, and high technology. Well-known Inner Mongolian enterprises include companies such as ERDOS, Yili, and Mengniu. As with much of China, economic growth has led to a boom in construction, including new commercial development and large apartment complexes.\n\n\nThe GDP of Inner Mongolia in 2022 was CN¥2.3 trillion (US$344 billion in nominal),[5] with an average annual increase of 10% from the period 2010–2015. Its per capita GDP was CN¥96,474 (US$14,343 in nominal), ranking 8th among all the 31 provincial divisions of China.[5] The primary, secondary and tertiary industries contributed ¥265 billion ($39.45 billion), ¥1.12 trillion ($167.1 billion) and ¥926 billion ($137.7 billion) to the GDP respectively.[5]\n\n\nIn addition to its large reserves of natural resources, Inner Mongolia also has the largest usable wind power capacity in China[47] thanks to strong winds which develop in the province's grasslands. Some private companies have set up wind parks in parts of Inner Mongolia such as Bailingmiao, Hutengliang and Zhouzi.\n\n\nEast of Jilantai, Inner Mongolia, there is a ballistic missile training area used by the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) to train missile crews for mobile missile launchers, their support vehicles, and silo-based ballistic missiles.[49]\n\n\n\n### Economic and Technological Development Zones[edit]\n\n\n* Baotou National Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone[50]\n* Erenhot Border Economic Cooperation Area\n* Hohhot Export Processing Zone\n\n\nHohhot Export Processing Zone was established 21 June 2002 by the State Council, which is located in the west of the Hohhot, with a planning area of 2.2 km2 (0.85 sq mi). Industries encouraged in the export processing zone include Electronics Assembly & Manufacturing, Telecommunications Equipment, Garment and Textiles Production, Trading and Distribution, Biotechnology/Pharmaceuticals, Food/Beverage Processing, Instruments & Industrial Equipment Production, Medical Equipment and Supplies, Shipping/Warehousing/Logistics, Heavy Industry.[51]\n\n\n\n* Hohhot Economic and Technological Development Zone\n* Hohhot Export Processing Zone\n* Manzhouli Border Economic Cooperation Area\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nLines wholly or partly in Inner Mongolia include:\n\n\n\n* Beijing–Baotou railway (Jingbao railway)\n* Baotou–Lanzhou railway\n* Beijing–Tongliao railway\n* Harbin–Manzhouli railway\n* Jiayuguan–Ceke railway\n* Jining–Tongliao railway\n* Linhe–Ceke railway\n* Nenjiang–Greater Khingan Forest railway\n* Tongliao–Ranghulu railway\n\n\nRailway stations in Inner Mongolia include:\n\n\n\n* List of stations on Jingbao railway\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Inner Mongolia\n\nSee also: List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China\n\nUnder the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, articles 112–122, autonomous regions have limited autonomy in both the political and economic arena. Autonomous regions have more discretion in administering economic policy in the region in accordance with national guidelines. Structurally, the Chairman—who legally must be an ethnic minority and is usually ethnic Mongolian—is always kept in check by the Communist Party Regional Committee Secretary, who is usually from a different part of China (to reduce corruption) and Han Chinese. As of May 2023[update], the current party secretary is Sun Shaocheng. The Inner Mongolian government and its subsidiaries follow roughly the same structure as that of a Chinese province. With regards to economic policy, as a part of increased federalism characteristics in China, Inner Mongolia has become more independent in implementing its own economic roadmap.\n\n\nThe position of Chairman of Inner Mongolia alternates between Khorchin Mongols in the east and the Tumed Mongols in the west.[*citation needed*] Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, this convention has not been broken. The family of Ulanhu has retained influence in regional politics ever since the founding the People's Republic. His son Buhe and granddaughter Bu Xiaolin both served as Chairman of the region.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mongols § Subgroups, Mongols in China, and List of ethnic groups in China\n\n![](image)Muslim-themed Street in Hohhot\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1954[52] | 6,100,104 | —     |\n| 1964[53] | 12,348,638 | +7.31% |\n| 1982[54] | 19,274,279 | +2.50% |\n| 1990[55] | 21,456,798 | +1.35% |\n| 2000[56] | 23,323,347 | +0.84% |\n| 2010[57] | 24,706,321 | +0.58% |\n| 2020[58] | 24,049,155 | −0.27% |\n| Established in 1947 from dissolution of Xing'an Province, Qahar Province, parts of Rehe Province, and Suiyuan Province; parts of Ningxia Province were incorporated into Inner Mongolia AR. |\n\n\nWhen the autonomous region was established in 1947, Han Chinese comprised 83.6% of the population, while the Mongols comprised 14.8% of the population.[59] By 2020, the percentage of Han Chinese had dropped to 78.7%. While the Hetao region along the Yellow River has always alternated between farmers from the south and nomads from the north, the most recent wave of Han Chinese migration began in the early 18th century with encouragement from the Qing dynasty, and continued into the 20th century. Han Chinese live mostly in the Hetao region as well as various population centres in central and eastern Inner Mongolia. Over 70% of Mongols are concentrated in less than 18% of Inner Mongolia's territory (Hinggan League, and the prefectures of Tongliao and Chifeng).\n\n\nMongols are the second largest ethnic group, comprising 17.7% of the population as of the 2020 census.[60] They include many diverse Mongolian-speaking groups; groups such as the Buryats and the Oirats are also officially considered to be Mongols in China. In addition to the Manchus, other Tungusic ethnic groups, the Oroqen, and the Evenks also populate parts of northeastern Inner Mongolia. There is also a significant number of Hui and Koreans.\n\n\nMany of the traditionally nomadic Mongols have settled in permanent homes as their pastoral economy was collectivised during the Mao era, and some have taken jobs in cities as migrant labourers; however, some Mongols continue in their nomadic tradition. In practice, highly educated Mongols tend to migrate to big urban centers after which they become essentially indistinct with ethnic Han Chinese populations.\n\n\nInter-marriage between Mongol and non-Mongol populations is very common, particularly in areas where Mongols are in regular contact with other groups. There was little cultural stigma within Mongol families for marrying outside the ethnic group, and in urban centers in particular, Mongol men and women married non-Mongols at relatively similar rates. The rates of intermarriage stands in very sharp contrast to ethnic Tibetans and Uyghurs in their respective autonomous regions. By the 1980s, for instance, in the former Jirim League, nearly 40% of marriages with at least one Mongol spouse was a mixed Mongol-Han Chinese marriage.[61] However, anecdotal reports have also demonstrated an increase in Mongol-female, Han Chinese-male pairings in which the woman is of a rural background, ostensibly shutting rural Mongol males from the marriage market as the sex ratio in China becomes more skewed with a much higher proportion of men.[62]\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnic groups in Inner Mongolia, 2010 census[63]\n| Ethnicity | Population | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Han | 19,650,687 | 79.54%\n |\n| Mongol | 4,226,093 | 17.11%\n |\n| Manchu | 452,765 | 1.83%\n |\n| Daur | 121,483 | 0.49%\n |\n| Evenks | 26,139 | 0.11%\n |\n| Oroqen people | 8,464 | 0.07%\n |\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Population\n | Han Chinese | Mongol | Manchu |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1953[64] | 6,100,104\n | 5,119,928\n | 83.9%\n | 888,235\n | 14.6%\n | 18,354\n | 0.3%\n |\n| 1964[64] | 12,348,638\n | 10,743,456\n | 87.0%\n | 1,384,535\n | 11.2%\n | 50,960\n | 0.4%\n |\n| 1982[64] | 19,274,281\n | 16,277,616\n | 84.4%\n | 2,489,378\n | 12.9%\n | 237,149\n | 1.2%\n |\n| 1990[65] | 21,456,500\n | 17,290,000\n | 80.6%\n | 3,379,700\n | 15.8%\n |  |  |\n| 2000[66] | 23,323,347\n | 18,465,586\n | 79.2%\n | 3,995,349\n | 17.1%\n | 499,911\n | 2.3%\n |\n| 2010[67] | 24,706,321\n | 19,650,687\n | 79.5%\n | 4,226,093\n | 17.1%\n | 452,765\n | 1.83%\n |\n| 2020[60] | 24,049,155\n | 18,935,537\n | 78.7%\n | 4,247,815\n | 17.7%\n |  |  |\n\n\n\n\nTerritories with Mongol majorities and near-majorities[*citation needed*]\n| Name of banner | Mongol population | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Horqin Right Middle Banner, Hinggan (2020)[68] | 221,258 | 86.6%\n |\n| New Barag Right Banner, Hulunbuir (2009) | 28,369 | 82.2%\n |\n| Horqin Left Back Banner, Tongliao | 284,000 | 75%\n |\n| New Barag Left Banner, Hulunbuir (2009) | 31,531 | 74.9%\n |\n| Horqin Left Middle Banner, Tongliao | 395,000 | 73.5%\n |\n| East Ujimqin Banner, Xilingol (2009) | 43,394 | 72.5%\n |\n| West Ujimqin Banner, Xilingol | 57,000 | 65%\n |\n| Sonid Left Banner, Xilingol (2006) | 20,987 | 62.6%\n |\n| Bordered Yellow Banner, Xilingol | 19,000 | 62%\n |\n| Hure Banner, Tongliao | 93,000 | 56%\n |\n| Jarud Banner, Tongliao | 144,000 | 48%\n |\n| Horqin Right Front Banner, Hinggan | 162,000 | 45%\n |\n| Old Barag Banner, Hulunbuir (2006) | 25,903 | 43.6%\n |\n| Jalaid Banner, Hinggan | 158,000 | 39%\n |\n| Ar Khorchin Banner, Chifeng (2002) | 108,000 | 36.6%\n |\n\n\n*Population numbers exclude members of the People's Liberation Army in active service based in Inner Mongolia.*\n\n\n\n## Language and culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Culture of Mongolia, Music of Mongolia, Music of Inner Mongolia, and Mongolian language in Inner Mongolia\n\n![](image)A KFC in Hohhot, the capital, with a bilingual street sign in Chinese and Mongolian\n![](image)Inner Mongolian carpet c. 1870\n![](image)Jade dragon of the Hongshan culture (4700 BC – 2900 BC) found in Ongniud Banner, Chifeng\nAlongside Chinese, Mongolian is the official provincial language of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where there are at least 4.1 million ethnic Mongols.[69] Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate)[70] However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in China, specifically in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012.[71] However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanised Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities.[72] The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language.[73][74] Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols.[70][75] The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.[76]\n\n\nBy law, all street signs, commercial outlets, and government documents must be bilingual, written in both Mongolian and Chinese. There are three Mongolian TV channels in the Inner Mongolia Satellite TV network. In public transportation, all announcements are to be bilingual.\n\n\nMongols in Inner Mongolia speak Mongolian dialects such as Chakhar, Xilingol, Baarin, Khorchin and Kharchin Mongolian and, depending on definition and analysis, further dialects[77] or closely related independent Central Mongolic languages[78] such as Ordos, Khamnigan, Barghu Buryat and the arguably Oirat dialect Alasha. The standard pronunciation of Mongolian in China is based on the Chakhar dialect of the Plain Blue Banner, located in central Inner Mongolia, while the grammar is based on all Inner Mongolian dialects.[79] This is different from the Mongolian state, where the standard pronunciation is based on the closely related Khalkha dialect. There are a number of independent languages spoken in Hulunbuir such as the somewhat more distant Mongolic language Dagur and the Tungusic language Evenki. Officially, even the Evenki dialect Oroqin is considered a language.[80]\n\n\nThe Han Chinese of Inner Mongolia speak a variety of dialects, depending on the region. Those in the eastern parts tend to speak Northeastern Mandarin, which belongs to the Mandarin group of dialects; those in the central parts, such as the Yellow River valley, speak varieties of Jin, another subdivision of Chinese, due to its proximity to other Jin-speaking areas in China such as the Shanxi province. Cities such as Hohhot and Baotou both have their unique brand of Jin Chinese such as the Zhangjiakou–Hohhot dialect which are sometimes incomprehensible with dialects spoken in northeastern regions such as Hailar.\n\n\nThe vast grasslands have long symbolised Inner Mongolia. Mongolian art often depicts the grassland in an uplifting fashion and emphasises Mongolian nomadic traditions. The Mongols of Inner Mongolia still practice their traditional arts. Inner Mongolian cuisine has Mongol roots and consists of dairy-related products and *hand-held lamb* (手扒肉). In recent years, franchises based on hot pot have appeared in Inner Mongolia, the best known of which is Little Sheep. Notable Inner Mongolian commercial brand names include Mengniu and Yili, both of which began as dairy product and ice cream producers.\n\n\nAmong the Han Chinese of Inner Mongolia, Shanxi opera is a popular traditional form of entertainment. See also: Shanxi. A popular career in Inner Mongolia is circus acrobatics. The internationally known Inner Mongolia Acrobatic Troupe travels and performs with the renowned Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Inner Mongolia\n\n| Religion in Inner Mongolia (2005–2010) |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| Chinese, Han Buddhism and Mongolian folk religion(worship of Heaven and ovoo/aobao) |  | 80% |\n| Tibetan Buddhism |  | 12.0% |\n| Chinese ancestral religion |  | 2.35% |\n| Christianity |  | 2.0% |\n| Islam |  | 1.0% |\n\n![](image)Temple of the White Sulde of Genghis Khan in the town of Uxin in Inner Mongolia, in the Mu Us Desert. The worship of Genghis is shared by Chinese and Mongolian folk religion.[note 4]\nAccording to a survey held in 2004 by the Minzu University of China, about 80% of the population of the region practice the worship of Heaven (that is named *Tian* in the Chinese tradition and *Tenger* in the Mongolian tradition) and of *ovoo/aobao*.[81]\n\n\nOfficial statistics report that 10.9% of the population (3 million people) are members of Tibetan Buddhist groups.[82] According to the Chinese Spiritual Life Survey of 2007 and the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christianity is the religious identity of 3.2% of the population of the region; and Chinese ancestral religion the professed belonging of 2.36%,[83] while a demographic analysis of the year 2010 reported that Muslims comprise the 0.91%.[84]\n\n\nThe cult of Genghis Khan, present in the form of various Genghis Khan temples, is a tradition of Mongolian shamanism, in which he is considered a cultural hero and divine ancestor, an embodiment of the *Tenger* (Heaven, God of Heaven).[85] His worship in special temples, greatly developed in Inner Mongolia since the 1980s, is also shared by the Han Chinese, claiming his spirit as the founding principle of the Yuan dynasty.[86]\n\n\nTibetan Buddhism (Mongolian Buddhism, locally also known as \"Yellow Buddhism\") is the dominant form of Buddhism in Inner Mongolia, also practised by many Han Chinese. Another form of Buddhism, practised by the Chinese, are the schools of Chinese Buddhism.\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\nIn the capital city Hohhot:\n\n\n\n* Da Zhao Temple is a Buddhist temple built in 1580.

It was founded in 1958, making it the PRC's first launch facility. As of 2021, Jiuquan has documented more launches than any other launch facilities in China, and is still the only launch site for crewed space missions (Shenzhou program). While geologically located inside Inner Mongolia, the launch center is named after Jiuquan, which is the nearest urban center in the nearby province of Gansu. As military facilities, the core areas at Jiuquan Center are highly restricted and can only be visited by tourist buses operated by the center, while the visitor center is open to the public and can be accessed from the south gate.\n\n\nInner Mongolia is also home to the two (and only two) space vehicles landing sites in China, the Siziwang Banner Landing Site in Ulanqab and the Dongfeng Landing Site in Alxa.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n### Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of universities and colleges in Inner Mongolia\n\n### Language policy and protest[edit]\n\n\nInner Mongolia under the People's Republic of China has historically allowed the Mongolian language as a medium of instruction. An 1979 article from the *People's Daily* praises the re-establishment of Mongolian-language education after \"interference and vandalism by the Gang of Four\" during the Cultural Revolution.[87]\n\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Inner Mongolia protests\n\nIt was reported by *The New York Times* on 31 August 2020 that in the summer 2020, the Chinese government announced a new education policy, which called for Chinese to gradually replace Mongolian as the language of instruction in three subjects, including language and literature, politics, and history, in elementary and middle schools around the Inner Mongolia region. Thousands of ethnic Mongolians in northern China gathered to protest the policy.[88]\n\n\n\n## Image gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Ulaanbutan grassland](image)\n\nUlaanbutan grassland\n* ![Inner Mongolian grassland](image)\n\nInner Mongolian grassland\n* ![Helan Mountains scenery](image)\n\nHelan Mountains scenery\n* ![Khitan people cooking.

It is the largest province of China by area and has the third smallest population. Its capital and largest city is Xining.\n\n\nQinghai borders Gansu on the northeast, Xinjiang on the northwest, Sichuan on the southeast and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the southwest. Qinghai province was established in 1928 during the period of the Republic of China, and until 1949 was ruled by Chinese Muslim warlords known as the Ma clique. The Chinese name \"Qinghai\" is after Qinghai Lake, the largest lake in China. The lake is known as Tso ngon in Tibetan, and as Kokonor Lake in English, derived from the Mongol Oirat name for Qinghai Lake. Both Tso ngon and Kokonor are names found in historic documents to describe the region.[7]\n\n\nLocated mostly on the Tibetan Plateau, the province is inhabited by a number of peoples including the Tibetans, Mongols, Han (concentrated in the provincial capital of Xining and nearby Haidong), Hui, Monguors, and Salars. According to the 2021 census reports, Tibetans constitute a fifth of the population of Qinghai and the Hui compose roughly a sixth of the population. There are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.6 million, with national minorities making up a total of 49.5% of the population.\n\n\nThe area of Qinghai came under the control of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty around 1724, after their defeat of Khoshut Mongols who previously controlled most of the area. After the Xinhai Revolution and the ensuing fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qinghai came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi's control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928. In the same year, the province of Qinghai was established by the Nationalist Government, with Xining as its capital.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Bronze Age, Qinghai was home to a diverse group of nomadic tribes closely related to other Central Asians who traditionally made a living in agriculture and husbandry, the Kayue culture. The eastern part of the area of Qinghai was under the control of the Han dynasty about 2,000 years ago. It was a battleground during the Tang and subsequent Central Plain dynasties when they fought against successive Tibetan tribes.[11]\n\n\nIn the middle of 3rd century CE, nomadic people related to the Mongolic Xianbei migrated to pasture lands around the Qinghai Lake (Koko Nur) and established the Tuyuhun Kingdom.\n\n\nIn the 7th century, the Tuyuhun Kingdom was attacked by both the Tibetan Empire and the Tang dynasty as both sought control over the Silk Road trade routes. Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo was victorious, and settled the area around Tso ngon (Lake Go, or Kokonor Lake).[12] Military conflicts had severely weakened the Tuyuhun kingdom and it was incorporated into the Tibetan Empire. The Tibetan Empire continued expanding beyond Tso ngon during Trisong Detsen's and Ralpacan's reigns, and the empire controlled vast areas north and east of Tso ngon until 848,[13] which included Xi'an.\n\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Tibetan Empire,[*clarification needed*] small local factions emerged, some under the titular authority of Central Plain polities. The Song dynasty defeated the Kokonor Kingdom in the 1070s.[14] During the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty's administrative rule of Tibet, the region comprised the headwaters of the Ma chu (Machu River, Yellow River) and the Yalong (Yangtze) rivers and was known as Amdo, but apportioned to different administrative divisions than Tibet proper.[15]\n\n\nMost of Qinghai was, for a short time in the aftermath of the Yuan dynasty’s overthrow, under the control of early Ming dynasty, but later gradually lost to the Khoshut Khanate founded by the Oirats. The Xunhua Salar Autonomous County is where most Salar people live in Qinghai. The Salars migrated to Qinghai from Samarkand in 1370.[16] The chief of the four upper clans around this time was Han Pao-yuan and Ming granted him office of centurion, it was at this time the people of his four clans took Han as their surname.[17] The other chief Han Shan-pa of the four lower Salar clans got the same office from Ming, and his clans were the ones who took Ma as their surname.[18]\n\n\nFrom 1640 to 1724, a big part of the area that is now Qinghai was under Khoshut Mongol control, but in 1724 it was conquered by the armies of the Qing dynasty.[19] Xining, the capital of modern Qinghai province, began to function as the administrative center, although the city itself was then part of Gansu province within the \"Tibetan frontier district\".[20][21] In 1724, 13-Article for the Effective Governing of Qinghai (Chinese:青海善后事宜十三条) was proposed by Nian Gengyao and adopted by the Central Government to gain full control of Qinghai.\n\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty, the governor was a viceroy of the Emperor, but local ethnic groups enjoyed significant autonomy. Many chiefs retained their traditional authority, participating in local administrations.[22] The Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) devastated the Hui Muslim population of Shaanxi, shifting the Hui center of population to Gansu and Qinghai.[23]: 405 Another Dungan Revolt broke out in Qinghai in 1895 when various Muslim ethnic groups in Qinghai and Gansu rebelled against the Qing. Following the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the region came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928.\n\n\nIn July–August 1912, General Ma Fuxiang was \"Acting Chief Executive Officer of Kokonur\" (de facto Governor of the region that later became Qinghai).[24] In 1928, Qinghai province was created. The Muslim warlord and General Ma Qi became military governor of Qinghai, followed by his brother Ma Lin (warlord) and then Ma Qi's son Ma Bufang. In 1932 Tibet invaded Qinghai, attempting to capture southern parts of Qinghai province, following contention in Yushu, Qinghai, over a monastery in 1932. The army of Ma Bufang defeated the Tibetan armies. Governor of Qinghai Ma Bufang was described as a socialist by American journalist John Roderick and friendly compared to the other Ma Clique warlords.[25] Ma Bufang was reported to be good humoured and jovial in contrast to the brutal reign of Ma Hongkui.[26] Most of eastern China was ravaged by the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, by contrast, Qinghai was relatively untouched.\n\n\nMa Bufang increased the prominence of the Hui and Salar people in Qinghai's politics by heavily recruiting to his army from the counties in which those ethnic groups predominated.[27] General Ma started a state run and controlled industrialization project, directly creating educational, medical, agricultural, and sanitation projects, run or assisted by the state. The state provided money for food and uniforms in all schools, state run or private. Roads and a theater were constructed. The state controlled all the press, no freedom was allowed for independent journalists.[28]\n\n\nAs the 1949 Chinese revolution approached Qinghai, Ma Bufang abandoned his post and flew to Hong Kong, traveling abroad but never returning to China. On January 1, 1950, the Qinghai Province People's Government was declared, owing its allegiance to the new People's Republic of China. Aside from some minor adjustments to suit the geography, the PRC maintained the province's territorial integrity.[29] Resistance to Communist rule continued in the form of the Huis' Kuomintang Islamic insurgency (1950–58), spreading past traditionally Hui areas to the ethnic-Tibetan south.[23]: 408 Although the Hui composed 15.6% of Qinghai's population in 1949, making the province the second-largest concentration of Hui after Ningxia, the state denied the Hui ethnic autonomous townships and counties that their numbers warranted under Chinese law until the 1980s.[23]: 411\n\n\n\n* ![The Khoshut Khanate (1642–1717) based in the Tibetan Plateau](image)\n\nThe Khoshut Khanate (1642–1717) based in the Tibetan Plateau\n* ![Chiang Kai-shek, leader of Nationalist China (right), meets with the Muslim generals Ma Bufang (second from left), and Ma Buqing (first from left) in Xining, Qinghai, in August 1942](image)\n\nChiang Kai-shek, leader of Nationalist China (right), meets with the Muslim generals Ma Bufang (second from left), and Ma Buqing (first from left) in Xining, Qinghai, in August 1942\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nQinghai is located on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. By area, it is the largest province in the People's Republic of China (excluding the autonomous regions).\n\n\nThe Yellow River originates in the southern part of the province, while the Yangtze and Mekong have their sources in the southwestern part. Qinghai is separated by the Riyue Mountain into pastoral and agricultural zones in the west and east.[30]\n\n\nThe Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve is located in Qinghai and contains the headwaters of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Mekong River. The reserve was established to protect the headwaters of these three rivers and consists of 18 subareas, each containing three zones which are managed with differing degrees of strictness.\n\n\nQinghai Lake is the largest salt water lake in China, and the second largest in the world. Other large lakes are Lake Hala in the Qilian mountains, lakes Gyaring and Ngoring in the headwater region of the Yellow River, Lake Donggi Cona, and many saline and salt lakes in the western part of the province. \n\n\nThe Qaidam basin lies in the northwest part of the province at an altitude between 3000 and 5000 meters above sea level. About a third of this resource rich basin is desert. \n\n\n\n* ![Nyenpo Yurtse, Jigzhi County, Qinghai](image)\n\nNyenpo Yurtse, Jigzhi County, Qinghai\n* ![Riyue Mountain in Qinghai](image)\n\nRiyue Mountain in Qinghai\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies largely or entirely on a single source**.

Significant rainfall occurs mainly in summer, while precipitation is very low in winter and spring, and is generally low enough to keep much of the province semi-arid or arid.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Qinghai\n\nThe Politics of Qinghai Province in the People's Republic of China are structured in a one party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.\n\n\nThe Governor of Qinghai (青海省省长) is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Qinghai. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Qinghai Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary (青海省委书记), colloquially termed the \"Qinghai Party Chief\".\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Qinghai and List of township-level divisions of Qinghai.\n\nBecause the Han form Qinghai's ethnic majority[30] and because none of its many ethnic minorities have clear dominance over the rest, the province is not administered as an autonomous region. Instead, the province has many ethnic autonomous areas at the district and county levels.[27] Qinghai is administratively divided into eight prefecture-level divisions: two prefecture-level cities and six autonomous prefectures:\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Administrative divisions of Qinghai** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Xining**\n\n**Haidong**\n\n**HaibeiTibetan AP**\n\n**HuangnanTibetan AP**\n\n**HainanTibetan AP**\n\n**Guoluo (Golog)Tibetan AP**\n\n**YushuTibetan AP**\n\n**HaixiMongol and Tibetan AP**\n\n**(Haixi)**\n |\n| Division code[33] | Division\n | Area in km2[34] | Population 2010[35] | Seat\n | Divisions[36] |\n| Districts | Counties | Aut. counties | CL cities |\n| 630000 | Qinghai Province\n | 720,000.00 | 5,626,723 | Xining city | 7 | 25 | 7 | 5\n |\n| 630100 | Xining city\n | 7,424.11 | 2,208,708 | Chengzhong District | 5 | 1 | 1 |  |\n| 630200 | Haidong city\n | 13,043.99 | 1,396,845 | Ledu District | 2 |  | 4 |  |\n| 632200 | Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 33,349.99 | 273,304 | Haiyan County |  | 3 | 1 |  |\n| 632300 | Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 17,908.89 | 256,716 | Tongren city |  | 2 | 1 | 1\n |\n| 632500 | Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 43,377.11 | 441,691 | Gonghe County |  | 5 |  |  |\n| 632600 | Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 76,442.38 | 181,682 | Maqên County |  | 6 |  |  |\n| 632700 | Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 197,953.70 | 378,439 | Yushu city |  | 5 |  | 1\n |\n| 632800 | Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 300,854.48 | 489,338 | Delingha city |  | 3 |  | 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Administrative divisions in Chinese and varieties of romanizations\n |\n| --- |\n| English | Chinese | Pinyin\n |\n| **Qinghai Province** | 青海省 | **Qīnghǎi Shěng** |\n| Xining city | 西宁市 | Xīníng Shì\n |\n| Haidong city | 海东市 | Hǎidōng Shì\n |\n| Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海北藏族自治州 | Hǎiběi Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 黄南藏族自治州 | Huángnán Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海南藏族自治州 | Hǎinán Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 果洛藏族自治州 | Guǒluò Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 玉树藏族自治州 | Yùshù Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海西蒙古族藏族自治州 | Hǎixī Měnggǔzú Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n\n\nThe eight prefecture-level divisions of Qinghai are subdivided into 44 county-level divisions (6 districts, 4 county-level cities, 27 counties and 7 autonomous counties).\n\n\n\n### Urban areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Population by urban areas of prefecture & county cities\n |\n| --- |\n| # | City | Urban area[37] | District area[37] | City proper[37] | Census date\n |\n| 1 | **Xining** | 1,153,417 | 1,198,304 | 2,208,708 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 2 | Golmud | 156,779 | 186,341 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (3) | Haidong[a] | 120,433 | 363,159 | 1,396,845 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (4) | Yushu[b] | 56,802 | 120,447 | *part of Yushu Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 5 | Delingha | 54,844 | 78,184 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (6) | Mangnai[c] | 33,440 | 33,451 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Haidong Prefecture is currently known as Haidong PLC after census; Ledu County & Ping'an County is currently known as Ledu & Ping'an (core districts of Haidong) after census.\n2. **^** Yushu County is currently known as Yushu CLC after census.\n3. **^** Mangnai Administrative Zone & Lenghu Administrative Zone County is currently known as Mangnai CLC after census.\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1912[38] | 368,000 | —     |\n| 1928[39] | 619,000 | +68.2% |\n| 1936–37[40] | 1,196,000 | +93.2% |\n| 1947[41] | 1,308,000 | +9.4% |\n| 1954[42] | 1,676,534 | +28.2% |\n| 1964[43] | 2,145,604 | +28.0% |\n| 1982[44] | 3,895,706 | +81.6% |\n| 1990[45] | 4,456,946 | +14.4% |\n| 2000[46] | 4,822,963 | +8.2% |\n| 2010[47] | 5,626,722 | +16.7% |\n\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nThere are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.6 million, with Han population standing at 50.5% of the total population and national minorities making up 49.5% of the population.[48] In 2010, Tibetan population stood at 20.7%, Hui 16%, Tu (Monguor) 4%, with also some groups of Mongol, and Salar, all of those groups being the most populous in the province. Han Chinese predominate in the cities of Xining, Haidong, Delingha and Golmud, and elsewhere in the northeast. The Hui are concentrated in Xining, Haidong, Minhe County, Hualong County, and Datong County. The Tu people predominate in Huzhu County and the Salars in Xunhua County; Tibetans and Mongols are sparsely distributed across the rural western part of the province.[27] Of the Muslim ethnic groups in China, Qinghai has communities of Hui, Salar, Dongxiang, and Bao'an.[16] The Hui dominate the wholesale business in Qinghai.[49]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Qinghai (2000s)\n\n\n\nBuddhism, Chinese folk religions (including Taoism), Bön and non-religious population (81.73%)\nIslam[50] (17.51%)\nChristianity[51] (0.76%)\n\n![](image)The Dongguan Mosque in Qinghai\nThe predominant religions in Qinghai are Chinese folk religions (including Taoist traditions and Confucianism) and Chinese Buddhism among the Han Chinese. The large Tibetan population practices Tibetan schools of Buddhism or traditional Tibetan Bön religion, while the Hui Chinese practice Islam. Christianity is the religion of 0.76% of the province's population according to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2004.[51] According to a survey of 2010, 17.51% of the population of Qinghai follow Islam.[50]\n\n\nFrom September 1848, the city was the seat of a short-lived Latin Catholic Apostolic Vicariate (pre-diocesan missionary jurisdiction) of Kokonur (alias Khouhkou-noor, Kokonoor), but it was suppressed in 1861. No incumbent(s) recorded.[52]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![A Taoist temple dedicated to Jiutian Xuannü on Mount Fenghuang, in Lunmalong village, Duoba, Xining](image)\n\nA Taoist temple dedicated to Jiutian Xuannü on Mount Fenghuang, in Lunmalong village, Duoba, Xining\n* ![A Buddhist temple on Riyue Mountain, in Huangyuan County, Xining](image)\n\nA Buddhist temple on Riyue Mountain, in Huangyuan County, Xining\n* ![Mosques and Chinese folk temples characterising the skyline of Huangyuan County](image)\n\nMosques and Chinese folk temples characterising the skyline of Huangyuan County\n* ![Rongwo Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in Tongren County](image)\n\nRongwo Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in Tongren County\n* ![Great Mosque of Duoba, Xining](image)\n\nGreat Mosque of Duoba, Xining\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nQinghai has been influenced by interactions \"between Mongol and Tibetan culture, north to south, and Han Chinese and Inner Asia Muslim culture, east to west\".[27] The languages of Qinghai have for centuries formed a Sprachbund, with Zhongyuan Mandarin, Amdo Tibetan, Salar, Yugur, and Monguor borrowing from and influencing one another.[53] In mainstream Chinese culture, Qinghai is most associated with the *Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven*.[*citation needed*] According to this legend, King Mu of Zhou (r. 976–922 BCE) pursued hostile Quanrong nomads to eastern Qinghai, where the goddess Xi Wangmu threw the king a banquet in the Kunlun Mountains.[54]\n\n\nThe main religions in Qinghai are Tibetan Buddhism, Islam and Chinese Folk Religions. The Dongguan Mosque has been continuously operating since 1380.[23]: 402 Measures of education in Qinghai are low, particularly among the ethnic minorities.[27] The yak, which is native to Qinghai, is widely used in the province for transportation and its meat.[30] The Mongols of Qinghai celebrate the Naadam festival on the Qaidam Basin every year.[55]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oil well in Tsaidam (Qaidam), Qinghai\nQinghai's economy is amongst the smallest in China. Its nominal GDP in 2022 was just RMB 361 billion (USD 50 billion) and contributes to about 0.30% of the entire country's economy. Per capita GDP was RMB 60,724 (USD 9,028) in nominal), the 24th in China.[3]\n\n\nIts heavy industry includes iron and steel production, located near its capital city of Xining. Oil and natural gas from the Qaidam Basin have also been an important contributor to the economy.[56] Salt works operate at many of the province's numerous salt lakes.\n\n\nOutside of the provincial capital, Xining, most of Qinghai remains underdeveloped. Qinghai ranks second lowest in China in terms of highway length, and will require a significant expansion of its infrastructure to capitalize on the economic potential of its rich natural resources.[56]\n\n\n\n### Economic and technological development zone[edit]\n\n\nXining Economic & Technological Development Zone (XETDZ) was approved as state-level development zone in July 2000. It has a planned area of 4.4 km2. XETDZ lies in the east of Xining, 5 km from the city centre. In the east of the province, Xining stands at the upper reaches of the Huangshui River—one of the Yellow River's branches. The city is surrounded by the mountains with an average elevation of 2261 m and the highest at 4393 m. XETDZ is the first of its kind at the national level on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is established to fulfill the nation's strategy of developing the west.\n\n\nXETDZ enjoys a convenient transportation system, connected by the Xining-Lanzhou expressway and running through by two main roads, the broadest in the city. It is 4 km from the railway station, 15 km from Xi'ning Airport — a grade 4D airport with 14 airlines to cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu and Xi'an. Xining is Qinghai province's passage to the outside world, a transportation hub with more than ten highways, over 100 roads and two railways, Lanzhou-Qinghai and Qinghai-Tibet Railways in and out of the city.\n\n\nIt focuses on the development of following industries: chemicals based on salt lake resources, nonferrous metals, and petroleum and natural gas processing; special medicine, foods and bio-chemicals using local plateau animals and plants; new products involving ecological and environmental protection, high technology, new materials as well as information technology; and services such as logistics, banking, real estate, tourism, hotel, catering, agency and international trade.[57]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qinghai Lake.\nMany tourist attractions center on Xining, the provincial seat of Qinghai.\n\n\nDuring the hot summer months, many tourists from the hot southern and eastern parts of China travel to Xining, as the climate of Xining in July and August is quite mild and comfortable, making the city an ideal summer retreat.\n\n\nQinghai Lake (青海湖; *qīnghǎi hú*) is another tourist attraction, albeit further from Xining than Kumbum Monastery (Ta'er Si). The lake is the largest saltwater lake in China, and is also located on the \"Roof of the World\", the Tibetan Plateau. The lake itself lies at 3,600 m elevation. The surrounding area is made up of rolling grasslands and populated by ethnic Tibetans. Most pre-arranged tours stop at Bird Island (鸟岛; *niǎo dǎo*). An international bicycle race takes place annually from Xining to Qinghai Lake.\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in the People's Republic of China\n\n![](image)China National Highway 109 in Qinghai\nThe Lanqing Railway, running between Lanzhou, Gansu and Xining, the province's capital, was completed in 1959 and is the major transportation route in and out of the province. A continuation of the line, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway via Golmud and western Qinghai, has become one of the most ambitious projects in PRC history. It was completed in October 2005 and now links Tibet with the rest of China through Qinghai.\n\n\nConstruction on the Golmud–Dunhuang Railway, in the province's northwestern part, started in 2012.\n\n\nSix National Highways run through the province.\n\n\nXining Caojiabao International Airport provides service to Beijing, Lanzhou, Golmud and Delingha. Smaller regional airports, Delingha Airport, Golog Maqin Airport, Huatugou Airport, Qilian Airport and Yushu Batang Airport, serve the province’s smaller communities; plans exist for the construction of three more by 2020.[58]\n\n\n\n## Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Telecommunications industry in China\n\nSince the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology began its \"Access to Telephones Project\", Qinghai has invested 640 million yuan to provide telephone access to 3860 out its 4133 administrative villages. At the end of 2006, 299 towns had received Internet access. However, 6.6 percent of villages in the region still have no access to the telephone. These villages are mainly scattered in Qingnan Area, with 90 percent of them located in Yushu and Guoluo. The average altitude of these areas exceeds 3600 meters, and the poor natural conditions hamper the establishment of telecommunication facilities in the region.\n\n\nSatellite phones have been provided to 186 remote villages in Qinghai Province as of September 14, 2007.[*citation needed*] The areas benefited were Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Qinghai has recently been provided with satellite telephone access. In June 2007, China Satcom carried out an in-depth survey in Yushu and Guoluo, and made a special satellite phones for these areas. Two phones were provided to each village for free, and calls were charged at the rate of 0.2 RMB (about a quarter of a US cent at that time) per minute for both local and national calls, with the extra charges assumed by China Satcom. No monthly rent was charged on the satellite phone. International calls were also available.\n\n\n\n## Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of universities and colleges in Qinghai.\n\n* Qinghai University (青海大学)\n* Qinghai Normal University (青海师范大学)\n* Qinghai University for Nationalities (青海民族大学)\n* Qinghai Medical College (青海医学院)\n* Qinghai Radio & Television University (青海广播电视大学)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2010 Yushu earthquake\n* Amdo\n* Geladandong\n* Haplogroup D-M15 (Y-DNA)\n* Haplogroup O3 (Y-DNA)\n* *Iris qinghainica* (native plant of Qinghai)\n* Major national historical and cultural sites in Qinghai\n* Tectonic summary of Qinghai\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Qinghai Province\".

It is the largest province of China by area and has the third smallest population. Its capital and largest city is Xining.\n\n\nQinghai borders Gansu on the northeast, Xinjiang on the northwest, Sichuan on the southeast and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the southwest. Qinghai province was established in 1928 during the period of the Republic of China, and until 1949 was ruled by Chinese Muslim warlords known as the Ma clique. The Chinese name \"Qinghai\" is after Qinghai Lake, the largest lake in China. The lake is known as Tso ngon in Tibetan, and as Kokonor Lake in English, derived from the Mongol Oirat name for Qinghai Lake. Both Tso ngon and Kokonor are names found in historic documents to describe the region.[7]\n\n\nLocated mostly on the Tibetan Plateau, the province is inhabited by a number of peoples including the Tibetans, Mongols, Han (concentrated in the provincial capital of Xining and nearby Haidong), Hui, Monguors, and Salars. According to the 2021 census reports, Tibetans constitute a fifth of the population of Qinghai and the Hui compose roughly a sixth of the population. There are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.6 million, with national minorities making up a total of 49.5% of the population.\n\n\nThe area of Qinghai came under the control of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty around 1724, after their defeat of Khoshut Mongols who previously controlled most of the area. After the Xinhai Revolution and the ensuing fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qinghai came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi's control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928. In the same year, the province of Qinghai was established by the Nationalist Government, with Xining as its capital.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Bronze Age, Qinghai was home to a diverse group of nomadic tribes closely related to other Central Asians who traditionally made a living in agriculture and husbandry, the Kayue culture. The eastern part of the area of Qinghai was under the control of the Han dynasty about 2,000 years ago. It was a battleground during the Tang and subsequent Central Plain dynasties when they fought against successive Tibetan tribes.[11]\n\n\nIn the middle of 3rd century CE, nomadic people related to the Mongolic Xianbei migrated to pasture lands around the Qinghai Lake (Koko Nur) and established the Tuyuhun Kingdom.\n\n\nIn the 7th century, the Tuyuhun Kingdom was attacked by both the Tibetan Empire and the Tang dynasty as both sought control over the Silk Road trade routes. Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo was victorious, and settled the area around Tso ngon (Lake Go, or Kokonor Lake).[12] Military conflicts had severely weakened the Tuyuhun kingdom and it was incorporated into the Tibetan Empire. The Tibetan Empire continued expanding beyond Tso ngon during Trisong Detsen's and Ralpacan's reigns, and the empire controlled vast areas north and east of Tso ngon until 848,[13] which included Xi'an.\n\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Tibetan Empire,[*clarification needed*] small local factions emerged, some under the titular authority of Central Plain polities. The Song dynasty defeated the Kokonor Kingdom in the 1070s.[14] During the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty's administrative rule of Tibet, the region comprised the headwaters of the Ma chu (Machu River, Yellow River) and the Yalong (Yangtze) rivers and was known as Amdo, but apportioned to different administrative divisions than Tibet proper.[15]\n\n\nMost of Qinghai was, for a short time in the aftermath of the Yuan dynasty’s overthrow, under the control of early Ming dynasty, but later gradually lost to the Khoshut Khanate founded by the Oirats. The Xunhua Salar Autonomous County is where most Salar people live in Qinghai. The Salars migrated to Qinghai from Samarkand in 1370.[16] The chief of the four upper clans around this time was Han Pao-yuan and Ming granted him office of centurion, it was at this time the people of his four clans took Han as their surname.[17] The other chief Han Shan-pa of the four lower Salar clans got the same office from Ming, and his clans were the ones who took Ma as their surname.[18]\n\n\nFrom 1640 to 1724, a big part of the area that is now Qinghai was under Khoshut Mongol control, but in 1724 it was conquered by the armies of the Qing dynasty.[19] Xining, the capital of modern Qinghai province, began to function as the administrative center, although the city itself was then part of Gansu province within the \"Tibetan frontier district\".[20][21] In 1724, 13-Article for the Effective Governing of Qinghai (Chinese:青海善后事宜十三条) was proposed by Nian Gengyao and adopted by the Central Government to gain full control of Qinghai.\n\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty, the governor was a viceroy of the Emperor, but local ethnic groups enjoyed significant autonomy. Many chiefs retained their traditional authority, participating in local administrations.[22] The Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) devastated the Hui Muslim population of Shaanxi, shifting the Hui center of population to Gansu and Qinghai.[23]: 405 Another Dungan Revolt broke out in Qinghai in 1895 when various Muslim ethnic groups in Qinghai and Gansu rebelled against the Qing. Following the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the region came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928.\n\n\nIn July–August 1912, General Ma Fuxiang was \"Acting Chief Executive Officer of Kokonur\" (de facto Governor of the region that later became Qinghai).[24] In 1928, Qinghai province was created. The Muslim warlord and General Ma Qi became military governor of Qinghai, followed by his brother Ma Lin (warlord) and then Ma Qi's son Ma Bufang. In 1932 Tibet invaded Qinghai, attempting to capture southern parts of Qinghai province, following contention in Yushu, Qinghai, over a monastery in 1932. The army of Ma Bufang defeated the Tibetan armies. Governor of Qinghai Ma Bufang was described as a socialist by American journalist John Roderick and friendly compared to the other Ma Clique warlords.[25] Ma Bufang was reported to be good humoured and jovial in contrast to the brutal reign of Ma Hongkui.[26] Most of eastern China was ravaged by the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, by contrast, Qinghai was relatively untouched.\n\n\nMa Bufang increased the prominence of the Hui and Salar people in Qinghai's politics by heavily recruiting to his army from the counties in which those ethnic groups predominated.[27] General Ma started a state run and controlled industrialization project, directly creating educational, medical, agricultural, and sanitation projects, run or assisted by the state. The state provided money for food and uniforms in all schools, state run or private. Roads and a theater were constructed. The state controlled all the press, no freedom was allowed for independent journalists.[28]\n\n\nAs the 1949 Chinese revolution approached Qinghai, Ma Bufang abandoned his post and flew to Hong Kong, traveling abroad but never returning to China. On January 1, 1950, the Qinghai Province People's Government was declared, owing its allegiance to the new People's Republic of China. Aside from some minor adjustments to suit the geography, the PRC maintained the province's territorial integrity.[29] Resistance to Communist rule continued in the form of the Huis' Kuomintang Islamic insurgency (1950–58), spreading past traditionally Hui areas to the ethnic-Tibetan south.[23]: 408 Although the Hui composed 15.6% of Qinghai's population in 1949, making the province the second-largest concentration of Hui after Ningxia, the state denied the Hui ethnic autonomous townships and counties that their numbers warranted under Chinese law until the 1980s.[23]: 411\n\n\n\n* ![The Khoshut Khanate (1642–1717) based in the Tibetan Plateau](image)\n\nThe Khoshut Khanate (1642–1717) based in the Tibetan Plateau\n* ![Chiang Kai-shek, leader of Nationalist China (right), meets with the Muslim generals Ma Bufang (second from left), and Ma Buqing (first from left) in Xining, Qinghai, in August 1942](image)\n\nChiang Kai-shek, leader of Nationalist China (right), meets with the Muslim generals Ma Bufang (second from left), and Ma Buqing (first from left) in Xining, Qinghai, in August 1942\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nQinghai is located on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. By area, it is the largest province in the People's Republic of China (excluding the autonomous regions).\n\n\nThe Yellow River originates in the southern part of the province, while the Yangtze and Mekong have their sources in the southwestern part. Qinghai is separated by the Riyue Mountain into pastoral and agricultural zones in the west and east.[30]\n\n\nThe Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve is located in Qinghai and contains the headwaters of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Mekong River. The reserve was established to protect the headwaters of these three rivers and consists of 18 subareas, each containing three zones which are managed with differing degrees of strictness.\n\n\nQinghai Lake is the largest salt water lake in China, and the second largest in the world. Other large lakes are Lake Hala in the Qilian mountains, lakes Gyaring and Ngoring in the headwater region of the Yellow River, Lake Donggi Cona, and many saline and salt lakes in the western part of the province. \n\n\nThe Qaidam basin lies in the northwest part of the province at an altitude between 3000 and 5000 meters above sea level. About a third of this resource rich basin is desert. \n\n\n\n* ![Nyenpo Yurtse, Jigzhi County, Qinghai](image)\n\nNyenpo Yurtse, Jigzhi County, Qinghai\n* ![Riyue Mountain in Qinghai](image)\n\nRiyue Mountain in Qinghai\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies largely or entirely on a single source**.

Significant rainfall occurs mainly in summer, while precipitation is very low in winter and spring, and is generally low enough to keep much of the province semi-arid or arid.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Qinghai\n\nThe Politics of Qinghai Province in the People's Republic of China are structured in a one party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.\n\n\nThe Governor of Qinghai (青海省省长) is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Qinghai. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Qinghai Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary (青海省委书记), colloquially termed the \"Qinghai Party Chief\".\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Qinghai and List of township-level divisions of Qinghai.\n\nBecause the Han form Qinghai's ethnic majority[30] and because none of its many ethnic minorities have clear dominance over the rest, the province is not administered as an autonomous region. Instead, the province has many ethnic autonomous areas at the district and county levels.[27] Qinghai is administratively divided into eight prefecture-level divisions: two prefecture-level cities and six autonomous prefectures:\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Administrative divisions of Qinghai** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Xining**\n\n**Haidong**\n\n**HaibeiTibetan AP**\n\n**HuangnanTibetan AP**\n\n**HainanTibetan AP**\n\n**Guoluo (Golog)Tibetan AP**\n\n**YushuTibetan AP**\n\n**HaixiMongol and Tibetan AP**\n\n**(Haixi)**\n |\n| Division code[33] | Division\n | Area in km2[34] | Population 2010[35] | Seat\n | Divisions[36] |\n| Districts | Counties | Aut. counties | CL cities |\n| 630000 | Qinghai Province\n | 720,000.00 | 5,626,723 | Xining city | 7 | 25 | 7 | 5\n |\n| 630100 | Xining city\n | 7,424.11 | 2,208,708 | Chengzhong District | 5 | 1 | 1 |  |\n| 630200 | Haidong city\n | 13,043.99 | 1,396,845 | Ledu District | 2 |  | 4 |  |\n| 632200 | Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 33,349.99 | 273,304 | Haiyan County |  | 3 | 1 |  |\n| 632300 | Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 17,908.89 | 256,716 | Tongren city |  | 2 | 1 | 1\n |\n| 632500 | Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 43,377.11 | 441,691 | Gonghe County |  | 5 |  |  |\n| 632600 | Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 76,442.38 | 181,682 | Maqên County |  | 6 |  |  |\n| 632700 | Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 197,953.70 | 378,439 | Yushu city |  | 5 |  | 1\n |\n| 632800 | Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 300,854.48 | 489,338 | Delingha city |  | 3 |  | 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Administrative divisions in Chinese and varieties of romanizations\n |\n| --- |\n| English | Chinese | Pinyin\n |\n| **Qinghai Province** | 青海省 | **Qīnghǎi Shěng** |\n| Xining city | 西宁市 | Xīníng Shì\n |\n| Haidong city | 海东市 | Hǎidōng Shì\n |\n| Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海北藏族自治州 | Hǎiběi Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 黄南藏族自治州 | Huángnán Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海南藏族自治州 | Hǎinán Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 果洛藏族自治州 | Guǒluò Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 玉树藏族自治州 | Yùshù Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海西蒙古族藏族自治州 | Hǎixī Měnggǔzú Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n\n\nThe eight prefecture-level divisions of Qinghai are subdivided into 44 county-level divisions (6 districts, 4 county-level cities, 27 counties and 7 autonomous counties).\n\n\n\n### Urban areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Population by urban areas of prefecture & county cities\n |\n| --- |\n| # | City | Urban area[37] | District area[37] | City proper[37] | Census date\n |\n| 1 | **Xining** | 1,153,417 | 1,198,304 | 2,208,708 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 2 | Golmud | 156,779 | 186,341 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (3) | Haidong[a] | 120,433 | 363,159 | 1,396,845 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (4) | Yushu[b] | 56,802 | 120,447 | *part of Yushu Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 5 | Delingha | 54,844 | 78,184 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (6) | Mangnai[c] | 33,440 | 33,451 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Haidong Prefecture is currently known as Haidong PLC after census; Ledu County & Ping'an County is currently known as Ledu & Ping'an (core districts of Haidong) after census.\n2. **^** Yushu County is currently known as Yushu CLC after census.\n3. **^** Mangnai Administrative Zone & Lenghu Administrative Zone County is currently known as Mangnai CLC after census.\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1912[38] | 368,000 | —     |\n| 1928[39] | 619,000 | +68.2% |\n| 1936–37[40] | 1,196,000 | +93.2% |\n| 1947[41] | 1,308,000 | +9.4% |\n| 1954[42] | 1,676,534 | +28.2% |\n| 1964[43] | 2,145,604 | +28.0% |\n| 1982[44] | 3,895,706 | +81.6% |\n| 1990[45] | 4,456,946 | +14.4% |\n| 2000[46] | 4,822,963 | +8.2% |\n| 2010[47] | 5,626,722 | +16.7% |\n\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nThere are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.6 million, with Han population standing at 50.5% of the total population and national minorities making up 49.5% of the population.[48] In 2010, Tibetan population stood at 20.7%, Hui 16%, Tu (Monguor) 4%, with also some groups of Mongol, and Salar, all of those groups being the most populous in the province. Han Chinese predominate in the cities of Xining, Haidong, Delingha and Golmud, and elsewhere in the northeast. The Hui are concentrated in Xining, Haidong, Minhe County, Hualong County, and Datong County. The Tu people predominate in Huzhu County and the Salars in Xunhua County; Tibetans and Mongols are sparsely distributed across the rural western part of the province.[27] Of the Muslim ethnic groups in China, Qinghai has communities of Hui, Salar, Dongxiang, and Bao'an.[16] The Hui dominate the wholesale business in Qinghai.[49]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Qinghai (2000s)\n\n\n\nBuddhism, Chinese folk religions (including Taoism), Bön and non-religious population (81.73%)\nIslam[50] (17.51%)\nChristianity[51] (0.76%)\n\n![](image)The Dongguan Mosque in Qinghai\nThe predominant religions in Qinghai are Chinese folk religions (including Taoist traditions and Confucianism) and Chinese Buddhism among the Han Chinese. The large Tibetan population practices Tibetan schools of Buddhism or traditional Tibetan Bön religion, while the Hui Chinese practice Islam. Christianity is the religion of 0.76% of the province's population according to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2004.[51] According to a survey of 2010, 17.51% of the population of Qinghai follow Islam.[50]\n\n\nFrom September 1848, the city was the seat of a short-lived Latin Catholic Apostolic Vicariate (pre-diocesan missionary jurisdiction) of Kokonur (alias Khouhkou-noor, Kokonoor), but it was suppressed in 1861. No incumbent(s) recorded.[52]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![A Taoist temple dedicated to Jiutian Xuannü on Mount Fenghuang, in Lunmalong village, Duoba, Xining](image)\n\nA Taoist temple dedicated to Jiutian Xuannü on Mount Fenghuang, in Lunmalong village, Duoba, Xining\n* ![A Buddhist temple on Riyue Mountain, in Huangyuan County, Xining](image)\n\nA Buddhist temple on Riyue Mountain, in Huangyuan County, Xining\n* ![Mosques and Chinese folk temples characterising the skyline of Huangyuan County](image)\n\nMosques and Chinese folk temples characterising the skyline of Huangyuan County\n* ![Rongwo Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in Tongren County](image)\n\nRongwo Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in Tongren County\n* ![Great Mosque of Duoba, Xining](image)\n\nGreat Mosque of Duoba, Xining\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nQinghai has been influenced by interactions \"between Mongol and Tibetan culture, north to south, and Han Chinese and Inner Asia Muslim culture, east to west\".[27] The languages of Qinghai have for centuries formed a Sprachbund, with Zhongyuan Mandarin, Amdo Tibetan, Salar, Yugur, and Monguor borrowing from and influencing one another.[53] In mainstream Chinese culture, Qinghai is most associated with the *Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven*.[*citation needed*] According to this legend, King Mu of Zhou (r. 976–922 BCE) pursued hostile Quanrong nomads to eastern Qinghai, where the goddess Xi Wangmu threw the king a banquet in the Kunlun Mountains.[54]\n\n\nThe main religions in Qinghai are Tibetan Buddhism, Islam and Chinese Folk Religions. The Dongguan Mosque has been continuously operating since 1380.[23]: 402 Measures of education in Qinghai are low, particularly among the ethnic minorities.[27] The yak, which is native to Qinghai, is widely used in the province for transportation and its meat.[30] The Mongols of Qinghai celebrate the Naadam festival on the Qaidam Basin every year.[55]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oil well in Tsaidam (Qaidam), Qinghai\nQinghai's economy is amongst the smallest in China. Its nominal GDP in 2022 was just RMB 361 billion (USD 50 billion) and contributes to about 0.30% of the entire country's economy. Per capita GDP was RMB 60,724 (USD 9,028) in nominal), the 24th in China.[3]\n\n\nIts heavy industry includes iron and steel production, located near its capital city of Xining. Oil and natural gas from the Qaidam Basin have also been an important contributor to the economy.[56] Salt works operate at many of the province's numerous salt lakes.\n\n\nOutside of the provincial capital, Xining, most of Qinghai remains underdeveloped. Qinghai ranks second lowest in China in terms of highway length, and will require a significant expansion of its infrastructure to capitalize on the economic potential of its rich natural resources.[56]\n\n\n\n### Economic and technological development zone[edit]\n\n\nXining Economic & Technological Development Zone (XETDZ) was approved as state-level development zone in July 2000. It has a planned area of 4.4 km2. XETDZ lies in the east of Xining, 5 km from the city centre. In the east of the province, Xining stands at the upper reaches of the Huangshui River—one of the Yellow River's branches. The city is surrounded by the mountains with an average elevation of 2261 m and the highest at 4393 m. XETDZ is the first of its kind at the national level on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is established to fulfill the nation's strategy of developing the west.\n\n\nXETDZ enjoys a convenient transportation system, connected by the Xining-Lanzhou expressway and running through by two main roads, the broadest in the city. It is 4 km from the railway station, 15 km from Xi'ning Airport — a grade 4D airport with 14 airlines to cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu and Xi'an. Xining is Qinghai province's passage to the outside world, a transportation hub with more than ten highways, over 100 roads and two railways, Lanzhou-Qinghai and Qinghai-Tibet Railways in and out of the city.\n\n\nIt focuses on the development of following industries: chemicals based on salt lake resources, nonferrous metals, and petroleum and natural gas processing; special medicine, foods and bio-chemicals using local plateau animals and plants; new products involving ecological and environmental protection, high technology, new materials as well as information technology; and services such as logistics, banking, real estate, tourism, hotel, catering, agency and international trade.[57]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qinghai Lake.\nMany tourist attractions center on Xining, the provincial seat of Qinghai.\n\n\nDuring the hot summer months, many tourists from the hot southern and eastern parts of China travel to Xining, as the climate of Xining in July and August is quite mild and comfortable, making the city an ideal summer retreat.\n\n\nQinghai Lake (青海湖; *qīnghǎi hú*) is another tourist attraction, albeit further from Xining than Kumbum Monastery (Ta'er Si). The lake is the largest saltwater lake in China, and is also located on the \"Roof of the World\", the Tibetan Plateau. The lake itself lies at 3,600 m elevation. The surrounding area is made up of rolling grasslands and populated by ethnic Tibetans. Most pre-arranged tours stop at Bird Island (鸟岛; *niǎo dǎo*). An international bicycle race takes place annually from Xining to Qinghai Lake.\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in the People's Republic of China\n\n![](image)China National Highway 109 in Qinghai\nThe Lanqing Railway, running between Lanzhou, Gansu and Xining, the province's capital, was completed in 1959 and is the major transportation route in and out of the province. A continuation of the line, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway via Golmud and western Qinghai, has become one of the most ambitious projects in PRC history. It was completed in October 2005 and now links Tibet with the rest of China through Qinghai.\n\n\nConstruction on the Golmud–Dunhuang Railway, in the province's northwestern part, started in 2012.\n\n\nSix National Highways run through the province.\n\n\nXining Caojiabao International Airport provides service to Beijing, Lanzhou, Golmud and Delingha. Smaller regional airports, Delingha Airport, Golog Maqin Airport, Huatugou Airport, Qilian Airport and Yushu Batang Airport, serve the province’s smaller communities; plans exist for the construction of three more by 2020.[58]\n\n\n\n## Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Telecommunications industry in China\n\nSince the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology began its \"Access to Telephones Project\", Qinghai has invested 640 million yuan to provide telephone access to 3860 out its 4133 administrative villages. At the end of 2006, 299 towns had received Internet access. However, 6.6 percent of villages in the region still have no access to the telephone. These villages are mainly scattered in Qingnan Area, with 90 percent of them located in Yushu and Guoluo. The average altitude of these areas exceeds 3600 meters, and the poor natural conditions hamper the establishment of telecommunication facilities in the region.\n\n\nSatellite phones have been provided to 186 remote villages in Qinghai Province as of September 14, 2007.[*citation needed*] The areas benefited were Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Qinghai has recently been provided with satellite telephone access. In June 2007, China Satcom carried out an in-depth survey in Yushu and Guoluo, and made a special satellite phones for these areas. Two phones were provided to each village for free, and calls were charged at the rate of 0.2 RMB (about a quarter of a US cent at that time) per minute for both local and national calls, with the extra charges assumed by China Satcom. No monthly rent was charged on the satellite phone. International calls were also available.\n\n\n\n## Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of universities and colleges in Qinghai.\n\n* Qinghai University (青海大学)\n* Qinghai Normal University (青海师范大学)\n* Qinghai University for Nationalities (青海民族大学)\n* Qinghai Medical College (青海医学院)\n* Qinghai Radio & Television University (青海广播电视大学)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2010 Yushu earthquake\n* Amdo\n* Geladandong\n* Haplogroup D-M15 (Y-DNA)\n* Haplogroup O3 (Y-DNA)\n* *Iris qinghainica* (native plant of Qinghai)\n* Major national historical and cultural sites in Qinghai\n* Tectonic summary of Qinghai\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Qinghai Province\".
