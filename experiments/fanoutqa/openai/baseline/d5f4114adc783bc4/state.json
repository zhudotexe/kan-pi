On average they stand between 20 and 26 inches (51 and 66\u00a0cm) and weigh between 35 and 75 pounds (16 and 34\u00a0kg).[11][12] Tough feet are an important feature and desirable trait for breeding consideration. As with their build, the Alaskan husky's coat can vary greatly; they usually have double coats with all colors and patterns of colors seen within various lines.[11][12] Distance-type Alaskan huskies often have denser double coats to better contend with cold temperatures and harsh wind, whereas sprint lines have shorter coats to allow for greater heat dissipation during races at high speeds.\n\n\nIt is common for distance-type Alaskan huskies to be outfitted with dog coats and dog booties during long expeditions and races, in order to regulate temperature and protect the dog's feet from ice and rough terrain.[5] The use of dog coats has become more common into the late 20th and early 21st centuries as even the distance lines have been bred for greater speed, sacrificing some of the heavier and more dense protective double-coat of their Arctic breed ancestors.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAs European traders and settlers arrived in Alaska they sought local entertainment, and turned to racing the local means of transportation, sled dogs.[10] Indigenous dogs found throughout Alaska were renowned for their great strength and stamina, but lacked speed, so various outcrosses to fleeter Old World breeds were utilized to produce faster-running dogs, including Siberian imports who dominated local organized races in Alaska.[13] Since the beginning of the 20th century, various breeders have turned to various outcrosses to produce different lines of racing dogs. Most lines today contain some form of traditional husky heritage in their bloodlines, Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian Huskies being the most common, although Mackenzie River huskies, Greenland Dogs, and Samoyeds have also been utilized.[10][12]\n\n![](image)An Alaskan husky at Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska\n![](image)Alaskan husky standing on his doghouseIn the latter half of the 20th century the primary use of sled dogs shifted from utility to sport, particularly career competitive sled dog racing. In order to facilitate greater speed for racing sport, various breeds of gundogs and sighthounds have now been bred into Alaskan husky lines, including Pointers, Greyhounds, German Shorthaired Pointers, Salukis, Borzois, Labradors and Setters; some breeders have even used wolves at various points.[10][12][11]\n\n\n## Lineage[edit]\n\n\nGenetic studies indicate that the Alaskan Husky originates from pre-Colonial North American Arctic village dogs (including precursors to the Alaskan Malamute) and Siberian imports (precursors to the Siberian Husky), crossbred with European breeds such as Pointers, German Shepherd Dogs, and Salukis to improve its performance.[9][8]\n\n\nIn 2015, a DNA study indicated that the Alaskan husky, the Siberian Husky, and the Alaskan Malamute share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled-dogs from Siberia. They were separate to the two Inuit dogs: the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland Dog. The Siberian Husky and the Malamute both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which was developed through crossing with European breeds.[8]\n\n\nOther breeds identified as having contributed to the Alaskan husky sled dog gene pool include Pointers, and a number of other non-arctic breeds by breed and type group. Genetic variation in the Alaskan husky has been analyzed based on the groupings of two purpose-driven distinct populations within the Alaskan sled dog gene pool: A distance group, and a sprint group:[9]\n\n\n\n* The distance group showed a higher contribution from the Arctic/Asian group, mainly the Siberian Husky and Alaskan Malamute, and the Mastiff/Terrier group consisting primarily of Great Pyrenees and Anatolian Shepard.[9] The distance group also showed to be more genetically distinct from one another across kennel-based populations and at the individual level, than the sprint group.[9]\n* The sprint group displayed a higher contribution from Pointer-type dogs and Salukis, and the lowest contribution from Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes, as well as the extreme-sprint specialists displaying the highest contribution from already long-bred Alaskan husky lineage.[9]\n* A sub-group chosen for analysis due to its overlap between distance and sprint types displayed the most Saluki contribution, more than the extreme sprint or extreme distance specialists.[9]\n\n\n![](image)Two Alaskan husky lead dogs hooked up at a race event\n## Health and physical capabilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A three-year-old male Alaskan husky\nThe Alaskan husky has selectively been bred specifically for its athletic performance.[14][5] As such, its level of athletic ability, as well as anabolic efficiency are far greater than the average domesticated dog, especially in endurance feats. Distance-specialist Alaskan huskies out-speed most animals and all other types of sled dogs when running distances of 50 miles or greater, even while pulling moderately sized loads.[5] Studies on the metabolic capabilities in working Alaskan husky sled dogs reveal that their system transitions to utilization of low-glucose energy sources (from high-glycogen carbohydrates) early on during long periods of travel, and their reliance on these low-glucose fuels (such as those higher in fats and proteins) continue and even extend to become more pronounced after working for longer periods.[14] A good appetite is a highly desirable trait, and is emphasized in breeding choices.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)Five-year-old male Alaskan husky from championship distance racing lines\nLike most working sled dogs, Alaskan huskies are capable of pulling far greater than their own body weight in load while in harness. Sprint teams of Alaskan huskies are capable of speeds of up to 28\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h),[16] whereas distance-specialist teams have completed 938 mile (1510\u00a0km) races in just 8 days, 3 hours, 40 minutes, and 13 seconds with time including 40 hours of mandatory rests and other routine rests on the trail.[17]\n\n\nAs specifically purposed working sled dogs, Alaskan huskies can be subject to climate or work-specific health conditions that any sled dogs may experience, such as temperature-related bronchitis or bronchopulmonary ailments, also known as \"ski asthma\".[18]\n\n\nIn 2020, the largest study of \"canine hematologic and serum biochemical analytes\" to date was published, including within it the largest data set of healthy athlete dogs; the dogs of reference were 4,804 sled dogs training for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, the overwhelming majority of which were Alaskan huskies.[19] The study found that anti-aging and anti-inflammatory biochemical levels in the dogs increased over time and with training, enhancing the dogs' physical and mental abilities until an average of 6.6 years of age. Despite noted differences in sex, genetic, and age groups in other areas, they were not statistically significant and were outside the scope of the study, making them scientifically inconclusive despite their observance.[19]\n\n\n\n## Behavior[edit]\n\n\nThe behaviors and temperament of the Alaskan husky can vary greatly due to the wide range of genetic backgrounds and bred-purposes within the breed. As with all sled dogs, a desire to pull and run are essential and are of high priority in decisions of breeding. Mental soundness is also important due to the need for dogs to be in close quarters with other dogs while hooked in the team, handled by people for proper care and transportation, and for dogs on racing teams to perform under environments which include trails crowded with spectators and other dog teams.[15]\n\n\nAs dogs selectively-bred for their ability as working sled dogs without direct physical feedback from the driver, intelligence and problem solving are highly desired in a specimen and are often marks of talented lead dogs, which are often those with the highest consideration as breeding prospects. Dogs are expected to read the trail and situation through instincts and experience, and thus superior cognitive abilities are often bred into Alaskan husky lines in tandem with physical athletic attributes.[20]\n\n\n\n## See Also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Dogs portal\n\n\n* List of dog breeds\n* Husky\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Desmond., Morris (2008). *Dogs\u00a0: the ultimate dictionary of over 1,000 dog breeds*.

It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.\n\n\nThe breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nous, sitting, at Guisachan, 1870s\nThe Golden Retriever was developed in Scotland in the nineteenth century by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks (later to become Baron Tweedmouth) from Flat-coated Retrievers judiciously crossed with Tweed Water Spaniels and some other British dog breeds.[2][3] Prior to the 1952 publication of the very detailed stud book which had been meticulously maintained by Marjoribanks, a number of romantic tales were published about the origins of the breed.[2][3][4]\n\n\nIn the 1860s Marjoribanks set out to create what to his mind was the ultimate breed of retriever at his Scottish estate Guisachan.[2][5] He started by acquiring a yellow-coloured Flat-coated Retriever dog called Nous;[note 1] Nous had been whelped in June 1864 and was the only yellow pup in an otherwise all black-coloured litter.[2][4] Whilst uncommon, occasionally liver, brown, golden or yellow-coloured purebred Flat-coated Retriever pups are whelped to matings of two black parents.[3][6] It is the pedigree of Nous that was the source for the romantic tales of the heritage of the Golden Retriever.[2] One early account claimed Nous was purchased from a Russian circus trainer in Brighton, another claimed he was bought from a cobbler, and yet another claimed a gypsy.[2] The stud book states that Nous was a Flat-coated Retriever bred by Lord Chichester on his Stanmer Park estate near Brighton.[5][6][7]\n\n\nIn 1868 Nous was mated to a Tweed Water Spaniel bitch named Belle, who is recorded in the stud book as being whelped in 1863 and being of \"Ladykirk breeding\".[2][6] The litter from this mating consisted of four yellow pups, Primrose, Ada, Cowslip and Crocus.[7][8] The best bitch from this litter, Cowslip, was mated to a Tweed Water Spaniel called Tweed with the mating producing a bitch pup called Topsy.[5] Cowslip was subsequently mated to a Red Setter called Sampson; that mating produced a dog pup called Jack.[5] Topsy was mated with a black Flat-coated Retriever called Sambo and a bitch pup from that litter, Zoe, was mated back to Jack and two pups from that mating were retained, a dog called Nous II and a bitch called Gill.[5] Gill was mated to a black Labrador Retriever called Tracer, and a bitch pup from that mating, Queenie, was mated back to Nous II; all Golden Retrievers descend from this mating.[5] The progeny from these various matings varied in colour from pure black to light cream, but it was the golden-coloured ones that were retained and mated to each other, forming the foundation stock of the Golden Retriever breed.[2] Marjoribanks is also known to have used a sandy-coloured Bloodhound and another Labrador in subsequent years of the breeding programme.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Sir Dudley Marjoribanks' early breeding programme[5] |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | Nous \u2642 *FCR* |  |  |  | Belle \u2640 *TWS* |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  | Sampson \u2642 *RS* |  | Cowslip \u2640 |  | Tweed \u2642 *TWS*  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Topsy \u2640 |  |  |  | Sambo \u2642 *FCR*  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  | Jack \u2642 |  |  |  |  | Zoe \u2640 |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Gill \u2640 |  |  |  | Tracer \u2642 *Lab* |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  | Nous II \u2642 |  |  |  | Queenie \u2640 |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n\n |\n|  |\n| \n\n---\n\n\n* FCR = Flat-coated Retriever\n* TWS = Tweed Water Spaniel\n* RS = Red Setter\n* Lab = Labrador Retriever\n |\n\n\nIn 1952 Marjoribanks's great-nephew, Giles Fox-Strangways, 6th Earl of Ilchester, teamed up with Elma Stonex and together they studied Marjoribanks's stud book.[6] In 1960 their research was published, presenting all of the evidence required to counter all tales of Russian ancestry.[6] The stud book, which covers the period from 1868 to 1890, is preserved in the library of the Kennel Club in London.[5]\n\n\n\n![](image)Winifred Charlesworth with two of her Golden Retrievers, 1910s\nIn the early days Golden Retrievers were called the 'Flat-coated Retriever, Golden',[note 2] Initially the Golden Retriever was considered a colour variety of the former breed.[2] In 1903 the Kennel Club recorded the first examples, listing them in the same register as Flat-coats.[2] In 1904 a Golden Retriever won a field trial and in 1908 the first examples were exhibited at conformation shows.[7] In 1911 a breed club was formed for the breed in England, the Golden Retriever Club, and they were given a new name, the 'Yellow or Golden Retriever'; from this point they were increasingly seen as a separate breed from the Flat-coated Retriever.[2] It was not until 1913 that the Kennel Club began recording them on a separate breed register from the Flat-coated Retriever and in 1920 the 'Yellow or' was dropped from the breed name and they were officially called the 'Golden Retriever'.[2][6]\n\n\nOne early twentieth century enthusiast of the breed, Winifred Charlesworth, was instrumental in the establishment of the breed club as well as its separate Kennel Club recognition.[6] It was she who drew up the first breed standard, which was adopted by the Kennel Club and with only minor amendments and remains largely unchanged.[6] She bred and exhibited the first Golden Retriever Show Champion, was a strong advocate for maintaining the working instincts of the breed, and she is credited with popularising it at field trials and introducing it to shooting sportsmen.[note 3][6]\n\n\nIn the years after the First World War its popularity increased markedly and in the 1920s and 1930s it spread through much of the Western world.[6] The Canadian Kennel Club recognised the breed in 1927, the American Kennel Club in 1932; the first examples were registered in France in 1934 and Australia in 1937.[2] The worldwide popularity of the breed meant it did not suffer the misfortunes many British dog breeds did during the Second World War due to British wartime restrictions on the breeding of larger dogs, with ample quality breeding stock available globally to ensure none of its characteristics were lost.[6]\n\n\nSince the 1940s its popularity has continued to grow, and it has become one of the most recognised and most frequently registered dog breeds in the Western world.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Facial features\n![](image)Differences in coat colours\n### Appearance[edit]\n\n\nThe Golden Retriever is a powerfully built, medium-sized breed of dog; according to the Kennel Club breed standard, dogs stand from 56 to 61 centimetres (22 to 24\u00a0in) and bitches from 51 to 56 centimetres (20 to 22\u00a0in).[6][9] Healthy adult examples typically weigh between 25 and 34 kilograms (55 and 75\u00a0lb).[10]\n\n\nThe Golden Retriever has a broad head with a well-defined stop, with dark eyes set well apart, a wide and powerful muzzle, a large black nose, dark-pigmented and slightly drooping flews, and ears of moderate size set high and hanging with a slight fold.[10][11] The neck is muscular and fairly long with loose-fitting skin, the shoulders well laid-back and long-bladed, and the body deep through the chest with well-sprung ribs.[6][10][11] The back is usually level from withers to croup and the long, straight tail is usually carried flat, roughly in line with the back.[6][10][11] The forelegs are straight with good bone, the hind legs are powerful with well bent stifles and muscular thighs, and the feet are cat-like.[6][10][11]\n\n\nThe double coat is a recognisable and striking feature:[8] the outer coat is long, flat or wavy and has good feathering on the forelegs, while the undercoat is dense and provides weather resistance.[10][11] The coat can be any shade of cream, yellow or gold; the coat typically becomes paler with age.[10][11] The Kennel Club breed standard prohibits red or mahogany-coloured coats, but a few white hairs on the chest are permitted.[9] Originally only yellow or golden coloured examples were permitted, this excluded many outstanding cream coloured dogs; to overcome this in 1936 the Kennel Club's standard was amended to include the cream colour.[6] The cream colour, which in more modern times can be almost white, has become the dominant colour and is particularly favoured by conformation show exhibitors.[12] Golden Retrievers that are bred for conformation shows tend to have longer and finer coats than those bred for working as gundogs.[12]\n\n\nThe Kennel Club breed standard is accepted by every kennel club in the world except those of Canada and the United States.[6] Breed standards in North America call for a slightly taller dog[note 4] and the cream colour is not permitted.[6]\n\n\n\n### Temperament[edit]\n\n\nThe Golden Retriever is considered an intelligent, gentle natured and very affectionate breed of dog.[3][8] As is typical with retriever breeds, the breed is generally calm and biddable, being very easy to train and extremely keen to please their master.[6][8] The breed is known to make excellent pets and family dogs, being generally extremely tolerant of children and keen to accompany any member of the family in a range of activities.[4] Due to their affable natures, the breed is often completely devoid of guarding instincts.[4] However, there have also been reports of some very aggressive Golden Retrievers in certain lineages. It has been suggested that these variations in aggression are partially caused by genetic factors.[14]\n\n\nThe breed usually retains many of their gundog traits and instincts including an excellent sense of smell and a strong instinct to retrieve; even among those not trained as gundogs it is typical for Golden Retrievers to present their owners with toys or other objects.[6][8] Compared to other retriever breeds the Golden Retriever is typically quite slow to mature.[8][12]\n\n\n\n## Popularity and uses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Retrieving a shot gamebird\nThe Golden Retriever is one of the most commonly kept breeds of companion dog in the Western world, and is often among the top ten dog breeds by number of registrations in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Canada.[2][3][15][16][17][18] It is a frequent competitor at dog shows; separate show lines of the breed have been developed.[3][8][12] The dogs can be trained as guide dogs and therapy dogs,[3][4] and may compete in obedience trials and other dog sports.[3][4]\n\n\nThe Golden Retriever is still used as a gundog by sportsmen, both as a hunting companion in the field and for competing in field trials.[3][8][12] It is used more for retrieval of land-based gamebirds such as grouse and partridge than for wildfowl hunting.[8] Those used as gundogs are usually from working lines specifically bred for field use; dogs from pet or show lines are rarely suitable.[3][8][12] A Golden Retriever with a traditional dense double coat is well suited to working in cold and wet conditions, as the coat provides water resistance and insulation.[8][12] Compared to other retriever breeds, the Golden Retriever is not a strong swimmer; its long coat causes it to sit low in the water when swimming.[8]\n\n\nThe Golden Retriever is much less commonly used by sportsmen as a hunting companion than the Labrador Retriever.[8][12] One reason is that the breed is generally quite slow to mature, particularly compared to the Labrador; often when a Golden Retriever is still in basic training a Labrador of the same age has already completed a season of hunting.[8][12] Another is its long coat, which requires more maintenance and grooming than that of the Labrador, particularly after working in muddy conditions or close cover, as their long hair is more prone to picking up dirt and burrs.[8][12] More Golden Retrievers are bred as pets or for the show ring than for hunting, so it can be hard for sportsmen to find pups bred from proven working lines.[12]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nGolden Retrievers are a generally healthy breed; they have an average lifespan of 12 to 13 years.[10] Irresponsible breeding to meet high demand has led to the prevalence of inherited health problems in some breed lines, including allergic skin conditions, eye problems and sometimes snappiness.[10] These problems are rarely encountered in dogs bred from responsible breeders.[10]\n\n\nThe breed is unusually prone to cancer, with one United States study finding cancer to be the cause of death in approximately 50% of the population, the second highest in the study. Several European studies found a much lower prevalence (20\u201339%), which may reflect the significant genetic divergence between the American and European populations. They are especially prone to hemangiosarcoma and lymphoma, with an estimated lifetime risk of one in five for the former and one in eight for the latter. The high prevalence of cancer deaths among Golden Retrievers may partly represent a lack of other congenital diseases.[19][20][21]\n\n\n\n## Notable Golden Retrievers[edit]\n\n\n* Liberty, presidential pet of President Gerald R.

A small-to-medium breed, it is the smallest of the six original breed of dogs native to Japan.[1] Its name literally translates to \"brushwood dog\", as it is used to flush game.\n\n\nA small, alert, and agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain and hiking trails, the Shiba Inu was originally bred for hunting.[1][2] It looks similar to other Japanese dog breeds such as the Akita Inu or Hokkaido, but the Shiba Inu is a different breed with a distinct bloodline, temperament, and smaller size than other Japanese dog breeds.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Appearance[edit]\n\n\nThe Shiba's frame is compact with well-developed muscles.[5]\n\n\nThe Shiba Inu is double coated, with the outer coat being stiff and straight and the undercoat soft and thick. Fur is short and even on the foxlike face, ears, and legs. Guard hairs stand off the body and are about 4 to 5\u00a0cm (1+1\u20442 to 2\u00a0in) long at the withers. The purpose of the guard hairs is to protect their underlying skin and to repel rain or snow. Tail hair is slightly longer and stands open in a brush.[6] Their tails are a defining characteristic and make them stand apart from other dog breeds.\n\n\nThe cream color is considered a \"major fault\" by both the Japan Kennel Club and American Kennel Club.[6] It should never be intentionally bred in a show dog, as the required markings known as \"urajiro\" (\u88cf\u767d) are not visible; \"Urajiro\" literally translates to \"underside white\".[2] Conversely, a white (cream) coat is perfectly acceptable according to the British Kennel Club breed standard.[7]\n\n\nThe *urajiro* (cream to white ventral color) is required in the following areas on all coat colors: on the sides of the muzzle, on the cheeks, inside the ears, on the underjaw and upper throat inside of legs, on the abdomen, around the vent and the ventral side of the tail. On reds: commonly on the throat, fore chest, and chest. On blacks and sesames: commonly as a triangular mark on both sides of the fore chest.[8]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![A \"white\" (also called \"cream\") Shiba Inu](image)\n\nA \"white\" (also called \"cream\") Shiba Inu\n* ![A sesame Shiba Inu](image)\n\nA sesame Shiba Inu\n* ![A black and tan Shiba Inu with urajiro](image)\n\nA black and tan Shiba Inu with urajiro\n* ![A red Shiba Inu with visible urajiro on the muzzle, cheeks, ears and throat](image)\n\nA red Shiba Inu with visible urajiro on the muzzle, cheeks, ears and throat\n\n\n## Temperament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Shiba Inu puppy\nShibas tend to exhibit an independent nature.[5] From the Japanese breed standard:\n\n\n\n\n> The dog has a spirited boldness and is fiercely proud with a good nature and a feeling of artlessness. The Shiba is able to move quickly with nimble, elastic steps.\n> \n> \n\n\nThe terms \"spirited boldness\" (\u608d\u5a01, *kan'i*), \"good nature\" (\u826f\u6027, *ry\u014dsei*), and \"artlessness\" (\u7d20\u6734, *soboku*) have subtle interpretations that have been the subject of much commentary.[9]\n\n\nThe Shiba is a relatively fastidious breed and feels the need to maintain itself in a clean state. They can often be seen licking their paws and legs, much as cats do. They generally go out of their way to keep their coats clean. Because of their fastidious and proud nature, Shiba puppies are easy to housetrain and in many cases will housebreak themselves. Having their owner simply place them outside after meal times and naps is generally enough to teach the Shiba the appropriate method of toileting.[10]\n\n\nThey are not known to be friendly and prone to attack other dogs when not trained properly. Shiba is not suitable for first time dog owners.\nA distinguishing characteristic of the breed is the so-called \"shiba scream\". When sufficiently provoked or unhappy, the dog will produce a loud, high-pitched scream. This can occur when attempting to handle the dog in a way that it deems unacceptable.[1][11][12]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A fragment of a J\u014dmon period *dog\u016b* with pointed ears, unearthed in Aomori Prefecture.\nThe Shiba Inu has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century.[13] Dogs with a similar appearance to the Shiba Inu were represented in *dog\u016b* made during the prehistoric J\u014dmon period of Japanese history.[14]\n\n\nThe Shiba Inu was bred to hunt and flush small game, such as birds and rabbits. Shiba lived in the mountainous areas of the Ch\u016bbu region. During the Meiji Restoration, western dog breeds were imported and crosses between these and native Japanese breeds became popular. From 1912 to 1926, almost no pure Shiba remained. From around 1928, hunters and intellectuals began to show interest in the protection of the remaining pure Shiba.[15]\n\n\nDespite efforts to preserve the breed, the Shiba nearly became extinct during World War II[5] due to a combination of food shortage and a post-war distemper epidemic.[1] All subsequent dogs were bred from the only three surviving bloodlines.[16] These bloodlines were the Shinshu Shiba from Nagano Prefecture, the Mino Shiba from the former Mino Province in the south of present-day Gifu Prefecture, and the San'in Shiba from Tottori and Shimane Prefectures.[17]\n\n\nThe Shinshu Shibas possessed a solid undercoat, with a dense layer of guard-hairs, and were small and red in color. The Mino Shibas tended to have thick, prick ears, and possessed a sickle tail, rather than the common curled tail found on most modern Shibas. The San'in Shibas were larger than most modern shibas, and tended to be black, without the common tan and white accents found on modern black-and-tan shibas.[17]\n\n\nWhen the study of Japanese dogs was formalized in the early and mid-20th century, these three strains were combined into one overall breed, the Shiba Inu.[17] The first Japanese breed standard for the Shiba, the Nippo Standard, was published in 1934. In December 1936, the Shiba Inu was recognized as a Natural Monument of Japan through the Cultural Properties Act, largely due to the efforts of Nippo (Nihon Ken Hozonkai), the Association for the Preservation of the Japanese Dog.[17][18]\n\n\nIn 1954, an armed service family brought the first Shiba Inu to the United States.[16] In 1979, the first recorded litter was born in the United States.[16] The Shiba was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1992 and added to the AKC Non-Sporting Group in 1993.[1][19] It is now primarily kept as a pet both in Japan and abroad.[20] According to the American Kennel Club, the Shiba Inu is the number one companion dog in Japan. In the United States, the growing popularity of the Shiba Inu is evident as the American Kennel Club Registration Statistics ranked the breed in 44th place in 2016, a rise from 50th place in 2012.[21]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Shiba Inu photographed in Italy in 2008.\nOverall, the Shiba Inu is a healthy dog breed.[22][23][24] Health conditions known to affect this breed are allergies, glaucoma, cataracts, hip dysplasia, entropion, and luxating patella.[25] Periodic joint examinations are recommended throughout the dog's life. Eye tests should be performed yearly as eye problems can develop over time. By two years of age, Shiba Inus may be considered fully free from joint problems if none have previously been discovered, since at this age the skeleton is fully developed.[26]\n\n\nAs with most dog breeds, Shibas should be walked or otherwise exercised daily.[27]\n\n\n\n### Life span[edit]\n\n\nTheir average life expectancy is from 12 to 15 years. Exercise, especially daily walks, is preferred for this breed to live a long and healthy life.[16] The oldest known Shiba, Pusuke, died at age 26 in early December 2011. Pusuke was the oldest known dog alive at the time and lived 5 years less than the world record for the longest living dog.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Grooming[edit]\n\n\nShiba Inus are very clean, so grooming needs will likely be minimal. They naturally tend to hate to be wet or bathed, thus, it is very important to get them accustomed when they are young. A Shiba Inu's coat is coarse (short to medium length), with the outer coat being 2.5 to 3.2\u00a0cm (1 to 1+1\u20444\u00a0in) long, and is naturally waterproof so there is little need for regular bathing. They have a thick undercoat that can protect them from temperatures well below freezing.[28]\n\n\nShedding, also known as blowing coat, can be a nuisance. Shedding is heaviest during the seasonal change and particularly during the summer season, but daily brushing can temper this problem. It is recommended that owners never shave or cut the coat of a Shiba Inu, as the coat is needed to protect them from both cold and hot temperatures.[28]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nDespite not being a popular dog breed outside of Japan, the Shiba Inu has become popular on the Internet. Doge is an Internet meme from 2013 including a Shiba Inu and broken English. A popular cryptocurrency, Dogecoin, is named after this meme and its logo bears an image of the Shiba Inu. According to Jamie Cohen, an assistant professor of media studies at Queens College of the City University of New York, the Shiba Inu breed has had a significant presence in online culture since at least 2010.[29]\n\n\nAnother Shiba Inu dog that went viral was a dog known as 'Cheems'. He had gone viral during the COVID-19 pandemic and had gained worldwide attention. Cheems died during cancer surgery on August 18, 2023 at the age of 12\u00bd years.[30]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n* ![icon](image)Dogs portal\n\n\n* List of dog breeds\n* Japan Kennel Club\n* Mameshiba\n* Nihon Ken Hozonkai\n* Shiba Inu Puppy Cam\n* Cheems\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Dog Owners Guide: Shiba Inu\".

The breed is divided into four varieties based on size, the **Standard Poodle**, **Medium Poodle**, **Miniature Poodle** and **Toy Poodle**, although the Medium Poodle is not universally recognised. They have a distinctive thick, curly coat that comes in many colors and patterns, with only solid colors recognized by breed registries. Poodles are active and intelligent, and are particularly able to learn from humans. Poodles tend to live 10\u201318 years, with smaller varieties tending to live longer than larger ones.\n\n\nThe Poodle likely originated in Germany, although the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) and a minority of cynologists believe it originated in France. Similar dogs date back to at least the 17th century. Larger Poodles were originally used by wildfowl hunters to retrieve game from water, while smaller varieties were once commonly used as circus performers. Poodles were recognized by both the Kennel Club of the United Kingdom and the American Kennel Club (AKC) soon after the clubs' founding. Since the mid-20th century, Poodles have enjoyed enormous popularity as pets and show dogs \u2013 Poodles were the AKC's most registered breed from 1960 to 1982, and are now the FCI's third most registered breed. Poodles are also common at dog shows, where they often sport the popularly recognized Continental clip, with face and rear clipped close, and tufts of hair on the hocks and tail tip.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 17th-century engraving of a Poodle\nMost cynologists believe the Poodle originated in Germany in the Middle Ages, from a dog similar to today's Standard Poodle. The Poodle was Germany's water dog, just as England had the English Water Spaniel, France the Barbet, Ireland the Irish Water Spaniel and the Netherlands the Wetterhoun.[1][2][3][4][5] Among the evidence used to support this theory is the Germanic name for the breed, Poodle or \"Pudel\" in German, which is derived from the Low German word \"puddeln\", meaning \"to splash\". Numerous works by various German artists from as early as the 17th century depict dogs of recognisably Poodle type.[1][2][3][5] Some cynologists believe the Poodle originated in France, where it is known as the \"Caniche\" and that the breed descends from the Barbet. This view is shared by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI).[6][7] Others argue that the breed originated in Russia, Piedmont or Northwest Africa.[4][7]\n\n\nWhatever the Poodle's country of origin, both their German and French breed names indicate the modern Poodle's ancestors were widely used by waterfowlers both to retrieve shot game and to recover lost arrows and bolts that had missed their mark.[3][4]\n\n\n\n### Size variants [edit]\n\n\nDue to their intelligence, obedient nature, athleticism and looks poodles were frequently employed in circuses, particularly in France.[2][3][5][7] In French circuses poodles were selectively bred down in size to create what is now known as the miniature poodle, which was known as the toy poodle until 1907, as a smaller sized dog is easier to handle and transport in a travelling circus.[5] As circus performers the variety was frequently seen performing all manner of tricks including walking tightropes, acting out comedies and even performing magic and card tricks.[2][3][5]\n\n\nThe Toy Poodle was created at the beginning of the 20th century when breeders again bred Miniature Poodles down in size to create a popular companion dog.[2][3][5] Initially, these efforts resulted in disfigured or misshapen pups, as well as pups with behavioural problems, as a result of irresponsible breeding for dwarfed size only. As new breeding practices were adopted, the variety became set as a toy-sized replica of the original.[2][3][5] Later attempts to create an even smaller variety, the Teacup Poodle, were unable to overcome serious genetic abnormalities and were abandoned.[5]\n\n\nThe last of the Poodle varieties to be recognised was the Medium Poodle, which in size is mid way in between the Standard and the Miniature Poodle. Not universally recognised by the world's kennel clubs, the Medium Poodle is recognised by the FCI and most Continental European kennel clubs.[3][5][6] One of the reasons for creating this fourth size variety may have been a desire to reduce the number of entries of Poodles by variety at conformation shows.[5]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\nThe Poodle was recognised by the Kennel Club of the United Kingdom in 1874, and by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1886, soon after the founding of both clubs.[8] In the United States, poodles were unpopular until 1935, when the Poodle Nunsoe Duc de la Terrace won best in show at Westminster.[9] Afterwards, they rapidly gained prominence, becoming the AKC's most registered breed from 1960 to 1982.[10] Since 1935, Poodles have won best in show at Westminster 10 times, the second-most of any breed.[11] As of 2012, the Poodle was the third-most popular FCI registered breed worldwide, after the Labrador Retriever and German Shepherd, with 118,653 new dogs registered per year from the 25 countries surveyed.[12]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n### Appearance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Black Standard Poodle\nThe Poodle is an active, athletic breed with the varieties differing mostly by size.[1][2][3] The FCI's breed standard states the Standard Poodle stands between 45 and 62 centimetres (18 and 24\u00a0in), the Medium Poodle between 35 and 45 centimetres (14 and 18\u00a0in), the Miniature Poodle between 28 and 35 centimetres (11 and 14\u00a0in) and the Toy Poodle 24 and 28 centimetres (9.4 and 11.0\u00a0in).[6]\n\n\nThe kennel clubs which do not recognise the Medium Poodle variety typically have the Standard Poodle between 38 and 60 centimetres (15 and 24\u00a0in) and Miniature Poodle between 28 and 38 centimetres (11 and 15\u00a0in), with the toy variety remaining unchanged.[3][5]\n\n\nA healthy adult Standard Poodle typically weighs between 20 and 32 kilograms (44 and 71\u00a0lb), a Medium Poodle between 15 and 19 kilograms (33 and 42\u00a0lb), a Miniature Poodle between 12 and 14 kilograms (26 and 31\u00a0lb) and a Toy Poodle between 6.5 and 7.5 kilograms (14 and 17\u00a0lb).[3]\n\n\n\n#### Coat[edit]\n\n\nPoodles have thick, curly coats with harsh fur. A pet owner can anticipate grooming a Poodle every four to eight weeks.[13]\n\n\nPoodles are often cited as a hypoallergenic dog breed. Their individual hair follicles have an active growth period that is longer than that of many other breeds; combined with the tightly curled coat, which slows the loss of dander and dead hair by trapping it in the curls, an individual Poodle may release less dander and hair into the environment. However, researchers have generally not found a difference in allergens across breeds.[14][15][16]\n\n\n\n#### Clips and grooming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Miniature Poodle with a Continental clip\nThe FCI and AKC allows Poodles to be shown in the Puppy, Continental (Lion in the FCI standard), English Saddle, or Sporting (Modern) clip. The FCI additionally recognizes the Scandinavian clip.[17][18] The most popular in the show ring is the Continental clip, where the face and rear end of the body are clipped, leaving tufts on the hocks and tip of the tail and rosettes on the hips.[19][17] A similar clip was historically used to prevent the poodle from getting weighted down by their fur when swimming to retrieve a bird, while still leaving their joints and vital organs covered.[11] Pet poodles are most often clipped similarly to the Sporting clip \u2014evenly over their entire body, with the face and paws cut shorter.[19]\n\n\nIn most cases, whether a Poodle is in a pet or show clip, the hair is completely brushed out. Poodle hair can also be \"corded\" with rope-like mats similar to those of a Komondor or human dreadlocks. Though once as common as the curly Poodle, corded Poodles are now rare. Corded coats are difficult to keep clean and take a long time to dry after washing.[20] Corded Poodles may be shown in all major kennel club shows.[6][21]\n\n\n\n#### Colours[edit]\n\n\nThe Poodle has a wide variety of colouring, including white, black, brown, blue, gray, silver, caf\u00e9 au lait, silver beige, cream, apricot, and red, and patterns such as parti-, abstract, sable, brindle and phantom.[22][23] Recognized FCI colourations are black, white, brown, gray, and fawn.[18] Recognition of multi-colored Poodles varies by registry. They were common historically, but became less popular in the early 1900s, and are excluded from many registries.[24] The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes Poodles in either solid-coloured and multi-colored coats; however, only solid-colored poodles may compete in conformation.[17][25]\n\n\nA parti-Poodle has patches of any other solid colour over a primarily white coat.[26] When a parti-coloured Poodle has black-and-white markings that resemble those of a tuxedo, it is called a \"tuxedo\" Poodle.[27] An abstract Poodle is primarily solid-coloured, with patches of white.[26] Phantom Poodles have a solid main color with a lighter colour appearing on their \"eyebrows\", muzzle and throat, legs and feet and below their tail. Phantom Poodles may also have a full face of the secondary color.[26]\n\n\n\n* ![White Poodles](image)\n\nWhite Poodles\n* ![Apricot and red Poodles](image)\n\nApricot and red Poodles\n* ![Black Poodle](image)\n\nBlack Poodle\n* ![Brown Standard Poodle at five weeks](image)\n\nBrown Standard Poodle at five weeks\n* ![Mature silver Poodle](image)\n\nMature silver Poodle\n* ![Phantom Poodles](image)\n\nPhantom Poodles\n* ![Miniature parti-Poodle](image)\n\nMiniature parti-Poodle\n\n\n### Temperament[edit]\n\n\nPoodles are a highly intelligent, energetic, and sociable breed. A 1994 book by Stanley Corey ranked them second out of 130 breeds in \"working and obedience intelligence\", a measure of their ability to learn from humans.[28] They are an active dog, requiring regular physical and intellectual activities.[22] Shyness or sharpness is considered a serious fault in the breed.[17] Though not suitable as a guard dog because it is neither a territorial breed nor particularly aggressive, poodles tend to be protective of their families and are good with children.[22]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nOverall, the Poodle is a comparatively healthy breed, and there are no health problems unique to the breed. Poodles have a life expectancy of 10\u201318 years, with the Standard Poodle, like most large dogs, tending to be more short-lived.[22][13]\n\n\nDespite their overall good health, Poodles suffer from a number of hereditary diseases due to inbreeding. The Poodle Health Registry lists over 50 major health disorders of Standard Poodles.[8] Some of the worst common hereditary poodle diseases are the skin disease sebaceous adenitis (estimated prevalence 2.7%) and Addison\u2019s disease, an endocrine system disorder. Both diseases became more prevalent in poodles after the 1960s burst in poodle popularity led to rapid breeding aimed at producing good show dogs. The breeding focused on a small number of popular bloodlines, creating a genetic bottleneck.[29][8] One study estimated that two average Standard Poodles are about as closely related as the offspring of two full sibling village dogs.[29]\n\n\n\n## Work and sport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Poodle retrieving a duckPoodles were originally bred for waterfowl hunting.[18] Despite this history, they are currently classified as companion dogs by the FCI.[18] Since the late 1980s, some breeders in the United States and Canada have been selecting for dogs with drive for birds in order to revive the breed for hunting, with some success.[30] Poodles are highly trainable dogs that typically excel in obedience training.[22] Historically, they were a popular circus dog. In addition to hunt tests, they do well in agility and rally.[11] They are among the most popular service dog breeds.[31]\n\n\nPoodles have been used as working dogs in the military since at least the 17th century, most likely because of their highly intelligent, trainable nature. Their background as a hunting dog makes them suitable to battlefields, and they can be trained to ignore gunfire. During the English Civil War, Prince Rupert of the Rhine had a famous hunting Poodle who would ride into battle with his master on horseback. Napoleon Bonaparte wrote in his memoirs about the faithfulness of a grenadier's pet Poodle who stayed with the body of his master at the Battle of Marengo.[32]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Animals portal\n* ![icon](image)Dogs portal\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n* ![flag](image)Germany portal\n\n\n* List of dog breeds\n* Labradoodle\n* Cockapoo\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Alderton, David (1987). *The dog: the most complete, illustrated, practical guide to dogs and their world*.

The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.\n\n\nIt was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Max von Stephanitz, the founder of the breed (with Horand von Grafrath), circa 1900\n![](image)Illustration from 1909\nDuring the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds.[5] Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators.[6] In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell.[6] The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.[5]\n\n\nTo combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany.[6] The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote;[6] some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance.[7] While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.\n\n\nWith the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary.[6] At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise.[6] Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working.[6] He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.[6]\n\n\nIn 1899, von\u00a0Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein.[6] Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von\u00a0Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately.[5] After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von\u00a0Stephanitz founded the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs).[5] Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register.[6] In just a few decades of the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde claimed 50,000\u00a0dues-paying members in more than 500\u00a0branches in Germany alone.[8]\n\n\nHorand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and W\u00fcrttemberg.[6] Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben.[6][9] Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84\u00a0pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring.[6] This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed.[6] Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German Shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von\u00a0Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.[10]\n\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism.[8] German Shepherds were coveted as \"*germanische Urhunde*\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era.[11] Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed.[12] Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'F\u00fchrerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover.[11] Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr.\u00a0Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result.[13] Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide.[14] German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.[15]\n\n\nWhen the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog.[16] But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers.[17][18] The reputation of the German Shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929.[19] Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.[20]\n\n\n\n### Naming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sable bitch (left) and dog (right)\nThe breed was named *Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund*, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".[21] At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as *Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde*, or old German herding dogs.\n\n\nThe direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity,[22] due to the anti-German sentiment of the era.[23] The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\",[22] after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.[6]\n\n\nEventually,[*when?*] the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped,[22] after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality.[6] The name Alsatian remained for five decades,[22] until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds.[24] The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010.[25]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Skeleton in the Museum of Veterinary Anatomy of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nGerman Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs.[26] The breed standard height at the withers is 60\u201365\u00a0cm (24\u201326\u00a0in) for males, and 55\u201360\u00a0cm (22\u201324\u00a0in) for females.[27][28][29] German Shepherds can reach sprinting speeds of up to 30 miles per hour.[30]\nShepherds are longer than they are tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to 8+1\u20442. The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard weight range.[31] They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown. The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as stalking. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.[28]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds have a double coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants: medium and long. The gene for long hair is recessive, and therefore the long-haired variety is rarer. Treatment of the long-haired variation differs across standards; it is accepted but does not compete against standard-coated dogs under the German and UK Kennel Clubs while it can compete with standard-coated dogs, but is considered a fault, in the American Kennel Club.[28][31][32] The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b, while the short-haired type is listed as the variety a.[33]\n\n\nMost commonly, German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most colour varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic \"saddle\" to an overall \"blanket\". Rarer colour variations include sable, pure-black, pure-white, liver, silver, blue, and panda varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation at All Breed and Specialty Shows.[31]\n\n\n\n* ![Saddle black-and-tan coat](image)\n\nSaddle black-and-tan coat\n* ![Black mask and sable](image)\n\nBlack mask and sable\n* ![Solid black](image)\n\nSolid black\n* ![Bi-colour](image)\n\nBi-colour\n* ![Long-haired black-and-tan](image)\n\nLong-haired black-and-tan\n\n\n### Intelligence[edit]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds were bred specifically for their intelligence.[34] In a list of breeds most likely to bark as watchdogs, Stanley Coren ranked the breed in second place.[35] Coupled with their strength, this trait makes the breed desirable as police, guard and search and rescue dogs, as they are able to quickly learn various tasks and interpret instructions better than other breeds.[36]\n\n\n\n## Temperament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A human infant with two dogs\nGerman Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self assured.[31] The breed is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become overprotective of their family and territory, especially if not socialised correctly.[37] They are not inclined to become immediate friends with strangers.[38] German Shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as protective of their owners.[39]\n\n\n\n### Aggression and biting[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Dog bite prevention\n\nA 2020 literature review in *Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery* found that from 1971 to 2018, of all pure breed dogs in the United States, the German Shepherd was responsible for the most bites severe enough to require hospital treatment.[40]\n\n\nWhile an Australian report from 1999 provides statistics showing that German Shepherds are the breed third most likely to attack a person in some Australian locales,[41] once their popularity is taken into account, the percentages of attacks by German Shepherds drops to 38th.[42]\n\n\nAccording to the National Geographic Channel television show *Dangerous Encounters*, the bite of a German Shepherd has a force of over 1,060 newtons (238\u00a0lbf) (compared with that of a Rottweiler, over 1,180\u20131,460 newtons (265\u2013328\u00a0lbf), a Pit bull, 1,050 newtons (235\u00a0lbf), a Labrador Retriever, of approximately 1,000 newtons (230\u00a0lbf), or a human, of approximately 380 newtons (86\u00a0lbf)).[43]\n\n\n\n## Modern breed[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A common breed club's goal for German Shepherd body conformity, criticised by the UK Kennel Club\nThe modern German Shepherd breed is criticised by experts for straying away from Max von Stephanitz's original ideology that German Shepherds should be bred primarily as working dogs and that breeding should be strictly controlled to eliminate defects quickly.[44]:\u200a6[45] He believed that, above all else, German Shepherds should be bred for intelligence and working ability.[6]\n\n\n\n### Controversy[edit]\n\n\nThe Kennel Club, in the United Kingdom, is involved in a dispute with German Shepherd breed clubs about the issue of soundness in the show strain of the breed.[46][47] Some show strains have been bred with an extremely roached topline (back) that causes poor gait in the hind legs.\n\n\nThe issue was raised in the BBC documentary, *Pedigree Dogs Exposed*, which said that critics of the breed describe it as \"half dog, half frog\". An orthopaedic vet remarked on footage of dogs in a show ring that they were \"not normal\".\n\n\nThe Kennel Club's position is that \"this issue of soundness is not a simple difference of opinion, it is the fundamental issue of the breed's essential conformation and movement.\"[46] The Kennel Club has decided to retrain judges to penalise dogs with these problems.[48]\n\n\nThe Kennel Club also recommends testing for haemophilia and hip dysplasia, other common problems with the breed.[49][50]\n\n\n\n## Variants[edit]\n\n\n### East-European Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nMain article: East-European Shepherd\n\n![](image)East-European Shepherd\nThe East-European Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the former Soviet Union with the purpose of creating a larger, more cold-resistant version of the German Shepherd. It lacks the physical deformities bred into western show lines of German Shepherds and has become one of Russia's most popular dog types.[51]\n\n\n\n### King Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nThe King Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States, its breeders hoping to rectify the physical deformities that have been bred into the original breed.[52]\n\n\n\n### Shiloh Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nThe Shiloh Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States. It was developed in the 1970s and 1980s to correct behavioural and conformational issues that have been bred into modern German Shepherds, and was bred for its large size, length of back, temperament and soundness of hips.[53][54] It has been recognised since 1990 by the American Rare Breed Association.[55]\n\n\n\n### White Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nMain article: White Shepherd\n\n![](image)White Shepherd\nThe White Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States. White-coated German Shepherds were once banned from registration in their native Germany, but in the United States and Canada the coloration gained a following and a breed club was formed specifically for white German Shepherds, calling their variety the White Shepherd. The variety is recognised as a separate breed by the United Kennel Club.[56]\n\n\n\n### White Swiss Shepherd Dog[edit]\n\n\nMain article: White Swiss Shepherd Dog\n\n![](image)White Swiss Shepherd Dog\nThe White Swiss Shepherd Dog (French: *Berger Blanc Suisse*, German: *Weisser Schweizer Sch\u00e4ferhund*, Italian: *Pastore Svizzero Bianco*) is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in Switzerland. It descends from the American White Shepherds; the first stud dog of what was to become the breed was an American dog born in 1966 and imported to Switzerland. The variety was recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale as a separate breed in 2003, and it is now recognised by a number of national kennel clubs.[56]\n\n\n\n## Use as a working dog[edit]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds are a popular selection for use as working dogs.[57] They are known for being easy to train and good for performing tasks and following instructions. They are especially well known for their police work, being used for tracking criminals, patrolling troubled areas and detection and holding of suspects. Additionally, thousands of German Shepherds have been used by the military. These military working dogs (MWD) are usually trained for scout duty, and they are used to warn soldiers to the presence of enemies or of booby traps or other hazards.[58] German Shepherds have also been trained by military groups to parachute from aircraft[59] or as anti-tank weapons. They were used in World War II as messenger dogs, rescue dogs and personal guard dogs.[6] A number of these dogs were taken home by foreign servicemen, who were impressed by their intelligence.[6]\n\n\nThe German Shepherd is one of the most widely used breeds in a wide variety of scent-work roles. These include search and rescue, cadaver searching, narcotics detection, explosives detection, accelerant detection and mine detection dog, among others. They are suited for these lines of work because of their keen sense of smell and their ability to work regardless of distractions.[58]\nAt one time the German Shepherd was the breed chosen almost exclusively to be used as a guide dog for the visually impaired. When formal guide dog training began in Switzerland in the 1920s under the leadership of Dorothy Eustis, all of the dogs trained were German Shepherd females.[60] An experiment in temperament testing of a group of Labrador Retrievers and German Shepherds showed that the Retrievers scored higher on average in emotional stability, ability to recover promptly from frightening situations, cooperative behaviour and friendliness; while the German Shepherds were superior in aggression and defensive behaviour. These results suggested that Labrador Retrievers were more suited to guide dog work while German Shepherds were more suited to police work.[61]\n\n\nCurrently, Labradors and Golden Retrievers are more widely used for this work, although there are still German Shepherds being trained. In 2013, about 15% of the dogs trained by Guide Dogs of America were German Shepherds, while the remainder are Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers.[62] The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the United Kingdom trains some German Shepherds,[63] while the comparable organisation in the US only trains Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers and crosses between these breeds.[64]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds are still used for herding and tending sheep grazing in meadows next to gardens and crop fields. They are expected to patrol the boundaries to keep sheep from trespassing and damaging the crops. In Germany and other places these skills are tested in utility dog trials also known as Herdengebrauchshund (HGH) herding utility dog trials.[65]\n\n\nOne Mexican German Shepherd, Zuyaqui, was dissected and his body put on display at the Sedena's \"Narco Museum\" in Mexico. He is regarded to be the dog who has captured the most drugs in Mexican police and military history.[66]\n\n\n\n* ![German night-watchman with dog, 1950](image)\n\nGerman night-watchman with dog, 1950\n* ![Swedish police dogs, 2007](image)\n\nSwedish police dogs, 2007\n* ![Rescue dog at the site of the collapsed World Trade Center, 2001](image)\n\nRescue dog at the site of the collapsed World Trade Center, 2001\n* ![Military dog during training](image)\n\nMilitary dog during training\n\n\n## Numbers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Globe icon.](image)\n | The examples and perspective in this section **deal primarily with the United Kingdom and the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject**.

By 1926 this number had grown to over 8000.[5] The breed gained international recognition after the end of World War I. Returning soldiers spoke highly of the breed and animal actors Rin Tin Tin and Strongheart popularised the breed further.[67] The first German Shepherd Dog registered in the United States was Queen of Switzerland. Her offspring had defects as the result of poor breeding, which caused the breed to decline in popularity during the late 1920s.[67]\n\n\nPopularity increased again after Sieger Pfeffer von Bern became the 1937 and 1938 Grand Victor in American Kennel club dog shows, only to have another decline at the conclusion of World War II, due to anti-German sentiment.[67] Popularity increased gradually until 1993, when they became the third most popular breed in the United States. As of 2016[update], the German Shepherd is the second most popular breed in the US.[67][68] It is typically among the most frequently registered breeds in other countries.[67] It was the third-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club in 2020,[69] and seventh-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom in 2016.[70]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nMany common ailments of the German Shepherd are a result of the inbreeding practised early in the breed's life.[71] One such common ailment is hip and elbow dysplasia which may cause the dog to experience pain later on in life and may cause arthritis.[72] A study conducted by the University of Zurich found that 45% of the police working dogs were affected by degenerative spinal stenosis, although a small sample size was used.[73] The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals found that 19.1% of German Shepherd are affected by hip dysplasia.[74] There are, however, ways to help prevent hip dysplasia, including getting a pup from a good breeder, keeping it on a healthy diet, and limiting the amount of jumping or rough play.[75] German Shepherds have low frequency of ear infections, since this breed is well known for hyperactivity of its cerumen-producing glands.[76] According to a recent survey in the UK, the median life span of German Shepherds is 10.95 years,[77] which is normal for a dog of their size.\n\n\nDegenerative myelopathy, a neurological disease, occurs with enough regularity specifically in the breed to suggest that the breed is predisposed to it. A very inexpensive DNA saliva test is now available to screen for degenerative myelopathy. The test screens for the mutated gene that has been seen in dogs with degenerative myelopathy. A small study in the UK showed 16% of young asymptomatic German Shepherds to be homozygous for the mutation, with a further 38% being carriers.[78] Now that a test is available the disease can be bred out of breeds with a high preponderance. The test is only recommended for predisposed breeds, but can be performed on DNA samples from any dog, collected through swabbing the inside of the animal's cheek with a sterile cotton swab. Prospective German Shepherd buyers can now request the test from the breeder or buy from a breeder who is known to test their dogs.[79]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds have a higher-than-normal incidence of Von Willebrand disease, a common inherited bleeding disorder,[80] and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), a degenerative disease of the pancreas. It is estimated that 1% of the UK population of German Shepherds has this disease.[81] Treatment is usually provided in the form of pancreatic supplements taken with food.\n\n\n\n### Skeletal health and supplementation[edit]\n\n\nMusculoskeletal disorders are debilitating conditions that are often associated with genetic makeup, malnutrition, and stress-related events.[82] Some breeds like the German Shepherd, are predisposed to a variety of different skeletal disorders, including but not limited to: canine hip dysplasia, Cauda equina syndrome, and osteoarthritis.[83][84] These conditions can be a result of poor breeding or induced by intense exercise and poor diet.\n\n\nCanine hip dysplasia (CHD) is an orthopaedic condition resulting from abnormal development of the hip joint and surrounding tissue causing the instability and partial dislocation of the hip joint, resulting in pain, inflammation, lameness, and potentially osteoarthritis of the joint.[83][85] German Shepherds are genetically predisposed to CHD and the University of Veterinary Medicine in Germany found its prevalence estimated to be approximately 35% of veterinary cases associated with the disorder.[84]\n\n\nOsteoarthritis is one of the main contributors of musculoskeletal pain and disabilities that commonly affect German Shepherds.[86][87] Mechanical stress, oxidative damage and inflammatory mediators combine to induce the gradual degeneration of the articular cartilage in the joint, resulting in reduced muscle mass, pain, and locomotion.[86][88]\n\n\nFeeding a well-balanced diet designed for large breeds like the German Shepherd to ensure adequate growth rates and proper maintenance of musculoskeletal health is essential.[82] Dietary energy levels should be monitored and controlled throughout all life stages and activity levels of the German Shepherd to assist in the prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal disorder symptoms.[82] Several dietary factors play a crucial role in maintaining skeletal health and are described as follows:\n\n\nAppropriate calcium levels are vital in developing a strong skeletal system and aid in preventing orthopaedic diseases like Canine Hip Dysplasia.[82] Furthermore, the ratio of calcium and phosphorus must be balanced and at a recommended ratio of 1.2:1 to ensure proper bone development and structure.[82] Imbalances in calcium and phosphorus levels can result in various skeletal complications.[82] Excess phosphorus can produce lesions in bones whereas excessive calcium can lead to hypocalcaemia and result in excess bone deposition, interfering with normal bone development.[82] In extreme circumstances of insufficient calcium intake, bone resorption can occur due to the body withdrawing calcium deposits from the skeletal frame as a last resort to fulfill dietary needs.[82]\n\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to be highly effective in the prevention of cartilage catabolism in *in vitro* models, suggesting that its supplementation in food could aid in decreasing the symptoms of osteoarthritis in German Shepherds.[89] Furthermore, EPA and DHA inhibit key regulators of the inflammatory process and suppress their activation which can help alleviate pain and reduce inflamed joints associated with many skeletal disorders.[88] Ensuring an appropriate ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids of approximately 5:1 is very important for inflammation processes.[82] Animals source, specifically marine life such as fish, krill, and mussels, and plant sources such as flaxseed, soybean and canola oil, are particularly rich in omega-3 fatty acids.[88]\n\n\nGlucosamine is an amino-monosaccharide that naturally occurs in all tissues, particularly in articular cartilage of joints and from the biosynthesis of glucose.[87] Natural synthesis of glucosamine occurs in the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage in joints.[82] However, as a result of damage to the joint or cartilage, there is decreased ability to synthesize glucosamine resulting in the deterioration of the joint, and supplementation is required.[82] Clinical trials of long term administration of glucosamine in German Shepherds have reduced symptoms of degenerative joint disease and accelerated cartilage healing.[90] Anti-inflammatory effects of glucosamine are believed to contribute to the reduction of pain, promote joint recovery and mobility, and prevent further cartilage degradation.[90] Similarly, chondroitin supplementation is proposed to have comparable results in inhibiting degradative enzymes within the cartilage matrix to reduce the effects of osteoarthritis, but further research is required to assess long term benefits.[82]\n\n\nVitamins such as A and D also have crucial roles in bone development and maintenance by regulating bone and calcium metabolism.[82] Adequate levels should be incorporated into a German Shepherd diet to promote a healthy musculoskeletal system.[82]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Strongheart, one of the earliest canine stars (1921)\nGerman Shepherds have been featured in a wide range of media.[91]\nIn 1921 Strongheart became one of the earliest canine film stars, and was followed in 1922 by Rin Tin Tin, who is considered[*by whom?*] the most famous German Shepherd. Both have stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[92]\n\n\nBatman's dog Ace the Bat-Hound appeared in the Batman comic books, initially in 1955,[93] through 1964.[94] From 1964 onwards, his appearances have been sporadic.\n\n\nA German Shepherd named Inspector Rex is the star of an Austrian Police procedural drama program of the same name, which won many awards, where German Shepherd Rex assists the Vienna Kriminalpolizei homicide unit.[95] The show was aired in many languages.[96]\n\n\nK\u00e1ntor\u00a0[hu] was a famous and very successful police dog in Hungary in the 1950s and early 1960s. After his death his story was fictionalised by two crime novels by Rudolf Szamos\u00a0[hu], titled K\u00e1ntor Investigates\u00a0[hu] and *K\u00e1ntor in the Big City*. A five-part thriller series for television titled *K\u00e1ntor* was produced in 1975, which was loosely based on the actual dog's story, setting the events more than a decade after the real K\u00e1ntor died. It became one of the staple productions of Hungarian television history, making German Shepherds the most popular dog breed in the country ever since. The taxidermy mount of K\u00e1ntor's body is on display at the Police Museum in Budapest.[97][98]\n\n\n\n## Notable individual German Shepherds[edit]\n\n\n* The dog on which the breed was founded\n\t+ Horand von Grafrath (January 1, 1895 \u2013 after 1899), considered the first German Shepherd and the genetic basis for modern German Shepherds\n* In film, television and fiction\n\t+ Strongheart (1 October 1917 \u2013 24 June 1929), featured in Hollywood films of 1921\u20131927\n\t+ Rin Tin Tin (September 1918 \u2013 10 August 1932), Rin Tin Tin Jr., and Rin Tin Tin III, featured in Hollywood films of 1922\u20131947\n\t+ Thunder the Dog (7 September 1921 \u2013 after October 1928), featured in Hollywood films of 1923\u20131927\n\t+ Silver Streak (born 1924), featured in Hollywood films of 1924\u20131928\n\t+ Lightning, grandson of Strongheart, featured in Hollywood films of 1934\u20131938\n\t+ Ace the Wonder Dog, featured in Hollywood films and serials of 1938\u20131946\n\t+ Rex the Wonder Dog, fictional superhero in the DC Comics universe 1952\u2013present\n\t+ Ace the Bat-Hound, fictional partner of Batman in DC Comics 1955\u2013present\n\t+ Joe, protagonist in the NBC television series *Run, Joe, Run* in 1974\u20131975\n\t+ Won Ton Ton, protagonist of the 1976 comedy film *Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood*, a spoof of Rin Tin Tin\n\t+ Koton, sometimes identified as Rando, police dog later featured in the 1989 film *K-9* with James Belushi\n\t+ Rex, protagonist of the Austrian-Italian comedy-drama television series *Inspector Rex* of 1994\u20132015, and remakes in other countries\n* Pets of political figures\n\t+ Blondi (1941 \u2013 29 April 1945), Hitler's pet on which he tested the cyanide capsules he later consumed to commit suicide, killing her\n\t+ Champ (11 November 2008 \u2013 19 June 2021), Commander (born 1 September 2021), and Major (born 17 January 2018), pets of US President Joe Biden\n\t+ Major, police dog later kept as a pet of United States president Franklin D.
