Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. The 429 units of the National Park System can be broadly referred to as national parks, but most have other formal designations.[4]\n\n\nA bill creating the first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then Rock Creek Park (later merged into National Capital Parks), Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"[5] Many current national parks had been previously protected as national monuments by the president under the Antiquities Act or as other designations created by Congress before being redesignated by Congress; the newest national park is New River Gorge, previously a National River, and the most recent entirely new park is National Park of American Samoa. A few former national parks are no longer designated as such, or have been disbanded. Fourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS),[6] and 21 national parks are named UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR),[7] with eight national parks in both programs.\n\n\nThirty states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The state with the most national parks is California with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell–St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 192.83 acres (0.7804 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.4 million acres (212,000 km2), for an average of 833 thousand acres (3,370 km2) but a median of only 220 thousand acres (890 km2).[8]\n\n\nThe national parks set a visitation record in 2021, with more than 92 million visitors.[9] Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee has been the most-visited park since 1944,[10] and had almost 13 million visitors in 2022.[11] In contrast, only about 9,500 people visited the remote Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Alaska in 2022.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## National parks[edit]\n\n\n\n**Map all coordinates using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\nLegend\n\\* Green – UNESCO designated World Heritage Sites (WHS)\n\n† Blue – UNESCO designated Biosphere Reserves (BR)\n\n‡ Purple – parks designated in both UNESCO programs\n\n\n\nList of U.S. national parks\n| Name\n | Image\n | Location\n | Date established as park[12] | Area (2023)[8] | Recreation visitors (2022)[11] | Description\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Acadia | ![A white lighthouse](image) | Maine44°21′N 68°13′W﻿ / ﻿44.35°N 68.21°W﻿ / 44.35; -68.21﻿ (Acadia) | February 26, 1919 | 49,071.40 acres (198.6 km2)\n | 3,970,260\n | Covering most of Mount Desert Island and other coastal islands, Acadia features the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coast of the United States, granite peaks, ocean shoreline, woodlands, and lakes.

Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. The 429 units of the National Park System can be broadly referred to as national parks, but most have other formal designations.[4]\n\n\nA bill creating the first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then Rock Creek Park (later merged into National Capital Parks), Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"[5] Many current national parks had been previously protected as national monuments by the president under the Antiquities Act or as other designations created by Congress before being redesignated by Congress; the newest national park is New River Gorge, previously a National River, and the most recent entirely new park is National Park of American Samoa. A few former national parks are no longer designated as such, or have been disbanded. Fourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS),[6] and 21 national parks are named UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR),[7] with eight national parks in both programs.\n\n\nThirty states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The state with the most national parks is California with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell–St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 192.83 acres (0.7804 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.4 million acres (212,000 km2), for an average of 833 thousand acres (3,370 km2) but a median of only 220 thousand acres (890 km2).[8]\n\n\nThe national parks set a visitation record in 2021, with more than 92 million visitors.[9] Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee has been the most-visited park since 1944,[10] and had almost 13 million visitors in 2022.[11] In contrast, only about 9,500 people visited the remote Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Alaska in 2022.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## National parks[edit]\n\n\n\n**Map all coordinates using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\nLegend\n\\* Green – UNESCO designated World Heritage Sites (WHS)\n\n† Blue – UNESCO designated Biosphere Reserves (BR)\n\n‡ Purple – parks designated in both UNESCO programs\n\n\n\nList of U.S. national parks\n| Name\n | Image\n | Location\n | Date established as park[12] | Area (2023)[8] | Recreation visitors (2022)[11] | Description\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Acadia | ![A white lighthouse](image) | Maine44°21′N 68°13′W﻿ / ﻿44.35°N 68.21°W﻿ / 44.35; -68.21﻿ (Acadia) | February 26, 1919 | 49,071.40 acres (198.6 km2)\n | 3,970,260\n | Covering most of Mount Desert Island and other coastal islands, Acadia features the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coast of the United States, granite peaks, ocean shoreline, woodlands, and lakes.

The park straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are a division of the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The park contains some of the highest mountains in eastern North America, including Clingmans Dome, Mount Guyot, and Mount Le Conte. The border between the two states runs northeast to southwest through the center of the park. The Appalachian Trail passes through the center of the park on its route from Georgia to Maine. With 14.1 million visitors in 2021, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited national park in the United States.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nMap Highlighting the Park's Boundaries\n\nThe park encompasses 522,419 acres (816.28 sq mi; 211,415.47 ha; 2,114.15 km2), making it one of the largest protected areas in the eastern United States.[3] The main park entrances are located along U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road) in the towns of Gatlinburg, Tennessee and Cherokee, North Carolina, and also in Townsend, Tennessee. The park is internationally recognized for its mountains, waterfalls, biodiversity, and forests.[7] In addition, the park preserves multiple historical structures that were part of communities occupied by early European-American settlers of the area.[8]\n\n\nThe park was chartered by the United States Congress in 1934, and officially dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. The Great Smoky Mountains was the first national park having land and other costs paid in part with federal funds; previous parks were funded wholly with state money or private funds.[9] The park was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and an International Biosphere Reserve in 1988.[10]\n\n\nAs the most visited national park in the United States, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park anchors a large tourism industry based in Sevier County, Tennessee adjacent to the park. Major attractions include Dollywood, the second-most visited tourist attraction in Tennessee, Ober Gatlinburg, and Ripley's Aquarium of the Smokies. Tourism to the park contributes an estimated $2.5 billion annually into the local economy.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor thousands of years, this region was occupied by successive cultures of indigenous peoples. The historic Cherokee had their homeland here, and occupied numerous towns in the river valleys on both sides of the Appalachian Mountains. Their first encounters with Europeans were as traders, mostly coming from the colonial Carolinas and Virginia.\n\n\nEuropean Americans did not begin to settle here until the late 18th and early 19th centuries.[12] Particularly because of their pressure to acquire land in the Deep South, in 1830 President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, beginning the process that eventually resulted in the forced removal of all Indian tribes east of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).\n\n\nMost of the Cherokee were also removed. For a period some, led by such warriors as Tsali, evaded removal by staying in the area now part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A band on the Oconaluftee River acquired land and also remained. Their descendants make up most of the federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, based in Cherokee, North Carolina, and their Qualla Boundary reserve to the south of the park.\n\n\n\n![](image)Clearcut logging in the Blue Ridge Mountains in Tennessee, 1936\nJohn Mingus, who built the Mingus Mill, and Ralph Hughes settled on the Oconaluftee in 1795. Other settlers soon followed and began clearing land and farming. In 1818, John Oliver and his family were the first white settlers to move into Cades Cove. After 1821, more families settled in Cades Cove including the Jobes, Gregorys, Sparkes, and Cables. As the community began to grow, the Cades Cove Baptist Church was established in 1827.[13]\n\n\nAs white settlers arrived, entrepreneurs developed logging as a major industry in the mountains. The Little River Railroad was constructed by Colonel W. B. Townsend[13] in the late-19th century to haul timber out of the remote regions of the area. Colonel Townsend had purchased 86,000 acres of land on the Little River. The construction of the Little River Railroad set an example for larger companies like the Ritter Lumber Company, Montvale Timber Company, and Norwood Lumber to also purchase acres of land for logging. The logging company Champion purchased 92,000 acres (37,000 ha) of land which included the Greenbrier Cove area and areas from Clingman's Dome to Mount Kephart. By 1909 logging was at its peak and by 1920 about two-thirds of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park area had been logged or burned by fires from logging operations.[13]\n\n\nBecause cut-and-run-style clearcutting was destroying the natural beauty of the area, by the 20th century visitors and locals banded together to raise money for preservation of the land. The U.S. National Park Service wanted a park in the eastern United States, but did not have much money to establish one. David C. Chapman; a Knoxville, Tennessee, business leader; was appointed in 1925 to head a commission to establish a national park here. Congress authorized the park in 1926, but there was no nucleus of federally owned land around which to develop it. John D. Rockefeller Jr. contributed $5 million, the U.S. government added $2 million, and private citizens from Tennessee and North Carolina pitched in to assemble the land for the park, piece by piece.\n\n\nSlowly, mountain homesteaders, miners, and loggers were evicted from the land. Farms and timbering operations were abolished to establish the protected areas of the park. Travel writer Horace Kephart, for whom Mount Kephart was named, and photographers Jim Thompson and George Masa were instrumental in fostering the development of the park.[9][14] Ben W. Hooper, a former governor of Tennessee, was the principal land purchasing agent for the park,[15] which was officially established on June 15, 1934. During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works Progress Administration, and other federal organizations hired workers to build trails, fire watchtowers, and other infrastructure improvements to the park and Smoky Mountains.\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe majority of rocks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are Late Precambrian rocks that are part of the Ocoee Supergroup. This group consists of metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites, schists, and slate. Early Precambrian rocks are not only the oldest rocks in the park but also the dominant rock type in sites such as the Raven Fork Valley and upper Tuckasegee River between Cherokee and Bryson City. They primarily consist of metamorphic gneiss, granite, and schist. Cambrian sedimentary rocks can be found among the bottom of the Foothills to the northwest, and in limestone coves such as Cades Cove.[16] One of the most visited attractions in the mountains is Cades Cove, which is a window or an area where older rocks made out of sandstone surround the valley floor of younger rocks made out of limestone.\n\n\nThe oldest rocks in the Smokies are the Precambrian gneiss and schists which were formed over a billion years ago from the accumulation of marine sediments and igneous rock. In the Late Precambrian, the primordial ocean expanded and the more recent Ocoee Supergroup rocks formed from the accumulation of eroding land mass onto the continental shelf. In the Paleozoic Era, the ocean deposited a thick layer of marine sediments which left behind sedimentary rock. During the Ordovician Period, the collision of the North American and African tectonic plates initiated the Alleghenian orogeny that created the Appalachian range. During the Mesozoic Era rapid erosion of softer sedimentary rocks re-exposed the older Ocoee Supergroup formations.[17]\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The observation tower at Clingmans Dome, the highest point in the national park\nElevations in the park range from about 875 feet (267 m) to 6,643 feet (2,025 m) at the summit of Clingmans Dome. Within the park a total of sixteen mountains reach higher than 5,000 feet (1,520 m).[18]\n\n\nThe wide range of elevations mimics the latitudinal changes found throughout the entire eastern United States. Ascending the mountains is comparable to a trip from Tennessee to Canada. Plants and animals common in the country's Northeast have found suitable ecological niches in the park's higher elevations, while southern species find homes in the balmier lower reaches.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Great Smoky Mountains National Park has two climate types: humid subtropical (Cfa), and temperate oceanic (Cfb).[*citation needed*] The plant hardiness zone at Clingmans Dome Visitor Center is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of −14.3 °F (−25.7 °C).[19]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Clingmans Dome Visitor Center, North Carolina (1981–2010 averages).

Annual precipitation amounts range from 50–80 in (1,300–2,000 mm),[22] with heavy winter snowfall in the higher elevations.[23] Flash flooding often occurs after heavy rain.[22]\n\n\nThe average temperature difference between the mountains, such as Newfound Gap at 5,048 ft (1,539 m) above MSL, and the valleys at about 1,600 ft (488 m), is between 10–13 °F (5.6–7.2 °C) for highs, and between 3–6 °F (1.7–3.3 °C) for lows. The difference between high temperatures is similar to the moist adiabatic lapse rate of 3.3 °F (1.8 °C) per 1,000 ft (300 m), while the smaller difference between low temperatures is the result of frequent temperature inversions developing in the morning, most often in autumn.[24]\n\n\nStrong damaging winds of 80–100 mph (130–160 km/h) or higher occur a few times each year around the Smoky Mountains, mainly during the cool season from October to April, as a result of a phenomenon known as mountain waves.[25] Mountain waves are strongest in a narrow area along the foothills, and can create extensive areas of fallen trees and roof damage, especially around Cades Cove and Cove Mountain.[26] Strong winds created by mountain waves were a contributing factor in the devastating Gatlinburg fire on November 28, 2016, during the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires.[27] Damaging winds can also be generated by strong thunderstorms, with tornadoes and strong thunderstorm complexes (also known as mesoscale convective systems) occasionally affecting the Smoky Mountains.[28]\n\n\n\n### Air pollution[edit]\n\n\nThe park is affected by air pollution because of increased development. In a 2004 report by the National Parks Conservation Association, Great Smoky Mountains National Park was considered the most polluted national park. From 1999 to 2003, the park recorded approximately 150 unhealthy air days, the equivalent of about one month of unhealthy air days per year.[29][30] In 2013, Colorado State University reported that, due to the passing of the United States Clean Air Act in 1970, and the subsequent implementation of the Acid Rain Program, there had been a \"significant improvement\" to the air quality in the Great Smoky Mountains from 1990 to 2010.[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Biology and ecology[edit]\n\n\nThe park is almost 95 percent forested, and almost 36 percent of it, 187,000 acres (76,000 ha), is estimated by the Park Service to be old growth forest with many trees that predate European settlement of the area.[33] It is one of the largest blocks of deciduous, temperate, old growth forest in North America.\n\n\n\n![](image)Colorful autumn leaves in October 2008\nThe variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of biota. About 19,000 species of organisms are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 100,000 undocumented species may also be present.\n\n\nPark officials count more than 200 species of birds, 50 species of fish, 39 species of reptiles, and 43 species of amphibians, including many lungless salamanders. The park is an important site for salamanders.[34] The park has a noteworthy black bear population, numbering about 1,500.[35] An attempt to reintroduce red wolves into the park in 1991 failed drastically, forcing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services to remove the wolves from the area in 1998. Elk (wapiti) were reintroduced to the park in 2001, three years after the FWS removed the red wolves from the area. Elk are most abundant in the Cataloochee area in the southeastern section of the park.[36]\n\n\nIt is also home to species of mammals such as the raccoon, bobcat, two species of fox, river otter, woodchuck, beaver, two species of squirrel, opossum, coyote, white-tailed deer, chipmunk, two species of skunk, and various species of bats.\n\n\nOver 100 species of trees grow in the park. The lower region forests are dominated by deciduous leafy trees. At higher altitudes, deciduous forests give way to coniferous trees like Fraser fir. In addition, the park has over 1,400 flowering plant species and over 4,000 species of non-flowering plants.\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\nThere have been hundreds of known species of fish living in the area.\n\n\n\n#### List of fish[edit]\n\n\nSource:[37]\n\n\n\n* American gizzard shad\n* Lamoetra appendix\n* Longnose gar\n* Mountain brook lamprey\n* Brook trout\n\n\n## Attractions and activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Alum Cave Trail to the summit of Mount LeConte provides numerous views of the Great Smoky Mountains.\nThe Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a major tourist attraction in the region. It has been the most visited national park for many years, with over 14.1 million recreational visitors (tourists) in 2021.[38] The recreational figure represents nearly twice as many tourists as the Grand Canyon, which received nearly 6 million visitors the same year. Surrounding towns, notably Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Townsend, Tennessee, and Cherokee, Sylva, Maggie Valley, and Bryson City, North Carolina, receive a significant portion of their income from tourism associated with the park.\n\n\nThe two main visitor centers inside the park are Sugarlands Visitors' Center near the Gatlinburg entrance to the park and Oconaluftee Visitor Center near Cherokee, North Carolina, at the eastern entrance to the park. These ranger stations provide exhibits on wildlife, geology, and the history of the park. They also sell books, maps, and souvenirs. Entrance into the park is free.[39]\n\n\nU.S. Highway 441 (known in the park as Newfound Gap Road) bisects the park, providing automobile access to many trailheads and overlooks, most notably that of Newfound Gap. At an elevation of 5,048 feet (1,539 m), it is the lowest gap in the mountains and is situated near the center of the park, on the Tennessee/North Carolina state line, halfway between the border towns of Gatlinburg and Cherokee. It was here that in 1940, from the Rockefeller Memorial, Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the national park. On clear days Newfound Gap offers arguably the most spectacular scenes accessible via highway in the park.\n\n\nLakeview Drive, located along the north shore of Fontana Lake, is a scenic road that was never completed. Split in two segments, it is accessible via either Fontana Dam or Bryson City. It features an unused road tunnel and connects to various hiking and horse-back riding trails in the area.\n\n\nThe park has a number of historical attractions. The most well-preserved of these (and most popular) is Cades Cove, a valley with a number of preserved historic buildings including log cabins, barns, and churches. Cades Cove is the single most frequented destination in the national park. Self-guided automobile and bicycle tours offer the many sightseers a glimpse into the way of life of old-time southern Appalachia. Other historical areas within the park include Roaring Fork, Cataloochee, Elkmont, and the Mountain Farm Museum and Mingus Mill on the Oconaluftee River.\n\n\n\n### Hiking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hiking in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\nThere are 850 miles (1,370 km) of trails and unpaved roads in the park for hiking, including 70 miles (110 km) of the Appalachian Trail.[40] Mount Le Conte is one of the most frequented destinations in the park. Its elevation is 6,593 feet (2,010 m), the third highest summit in the park and, measured from its base to its highest peak, the tallest mountain east of the Mississippi River. Alum Cave Trail is the most heavily used of the five paths en route to the summit. It provides many scenic overlooks and unique natural attractions such as Alum Cave Bluffs and Arch Rock. Hikers may spend a night at the LeConte Lodge, located near the summit, which provides cabins and rooms for rent (except during the winter season). Accessible solely by trail, it is the only private lodging available inside the park.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Chimney Tops was a popular destination for hikers until access was closed due to damage from the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires.\nAnother popular hiking trail led to the pinnacle of the Chimney Tops, so named because of its unique dual-humped peaktops. This short but strenuous trek rewarded nature enthusiasts with a spectacular panorama of the surrounding mountain peaks. It was the flashpoint for the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires, and therefore sustained extensive damage, evident still today in clearly visible burn scars. The peak has been closed to tourists ever since.\n\n\nBoth the Laurel Falls and Clingmans Dome trails offer relatively easy, short, paved paths to their respective destinations. The Laurel Falls Trail leads to a powerful 80-foot (24 m) waterfall, and the Clingmans Dome Trail takes visitors on an uphill climb to a 50 feet (15 m) tall observation deck, which on a clear day offers views for many miles over the Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia mountains.\n\n\nIn addition to day hiking, the national park offers opportunities for backpacking and camping. Camping is allowed only in designated camping areas and shelters. Most of the park's trail shelters are located along the Appalachian Trail or a short distance away on side trails. In addition to the Appalachian Trail shelters used mostly for extended backpacking trips there are three shelters in the park that are not located on the Appalachian Trail. The Mt. LeConte Shelter is located a short distance east of LeConte Lodge on The Boulevard Trail. It can accommodate 12 people per night, and is the only backcountry site in the entire park that has a permanent ban on campfires. The Kephart Shelter is located at the terminus of the Kephart Prong Trail which begins upstream of the Collins Creek Picnic Area. The shelter, situated along a tributary of the Oconaluftee River can accommodate 14 people. Laurel Gap Shelter is one of the more remote shelters in the park. Situated in a Beech forest swag between Balsam High Top and Big Cataloochee Mountain, the Laurel Gap Shelter can accommodate up to 14 people per night. This shelter is a popular base camp for peakbaggers exploring the heart of the Smokies wilderness.\n\n\nDesignated backcountry campsites are scattered throughout the park. A permit, available at ranger stations and via the park website, is required for all backcountry camping. Additionally, reservations are required for all of the shelters and backcountry campsites. A maximum stay of one night, in the case of shelters, or three nights, in the case of campsites, may limit the traveler's itinerary.\n\n\n\n### Other activities[edit]\n\n\nAfter hiking and simple sightseeing, fishing (especially fly fishing) is the most popular activity in the national park. The park's waters have long had a reputation for healthy trout activity as well as challenging fishing terrain. Brook trout are native to the waters, while both brown and rainbow were introduced to the area. Partially due to the fact of recent droughts killing off the native fish, there are strict regulations regarding how fishing may be conducted. Horseback riding (offered by the national park and on limited trails), bicycling (available for rent in Cades Cove) and water tubing are all also practiced within the park.\n\n\nFrom late May to early June, the Elkmont area of the park hosts the peak display period for synchronous fireflies (*Photinus carolinus*), one of at least 19 species of fireflies that live in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[41] They are the only species in America whose individuals can synchronize their flashing light patterns.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cades Cove panorama\n## Historic areas within the national park[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of historical structures maintained by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\n![](image)The Becky Cable house in the Cades Cove Historic District was built in 1879.\nThe park service maintains four historic districts and one archaeological district within park boundaries, as well as nine individual listings on the National Register of Historic Places. Notable structures not listed include the Mountain Farm Museum buildings at Oconaluftee and buildings in the Cataloochee area. The Mingus Mill (in Oconaluftee) and Smoky Mountain Hiking Club cabin in Greenbrier have been deemed eligible for listing.\n\n\n\n### Historic districts[edit]\n\n\n* Cades Cove Historic District\n* Elkmont Historic District\n* Oconaluftee Archaeological District\n* Noah Ogle Place\n* Roaring Fork Historic District\n\n\n### Individual listings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The John Ownby Cabin in The Sugarlands valley was built in 1860.\n* Alex Cole Cabin\n* Clingmans Dome Observation Tower\n* Hall Cabin (in Hazel Creek area)\n* John Messer Barn\n* John Ownby Cabin\n* Oconaluftee Baptist Church (also called Smokemont Baptist Church)\n* Tyson McCarter Place\n* Mayna Treanor Avent Studio\n* Little Greenbrier School\n* Walker Sisters Place\n\n\n## Cultural importance[edit]\n\n\nThe park was used for filming scenes of Disney's hit 1950s TV series *Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier*.\n\n\nThis park was designated an International Biosphere Reserve in 1976, was certified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and became a part of the Southern Appalachian Biosphere Reserve in 1988.[43]\n\n\nA 75th anniversary re-dedication ceremony was held on 2 September 2009. Among those in attendance were the four U.S. senators from Tennessee and North Carolina, the three US Representatives whose districts include the park, the governors of both states, and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. Dolly Parton, Tennessee native, singer, and actress also attended and performed.[44]\n\n\nIn late November and early December 2016, a series of wildfires engulfed a total of 17,900 acres (72 km2) in the park and surrounding areas. The wildfires killed at least 14, injured 190, and forced the evacuation of more than 14,000 people.[45] The fires also damaged or destroyed at least 2,000 structures. The fires, which were initially suspected to have been caused by arson, occurred during a period of unusual drought, which accelerated the fires. The wildfires were the deadliest in the Eastern United States since the Great Fires of 1947, and comprised one of the worst natural disasters in the history of Tennessee.[46][47][48][49]\n\n\nIn 2015 Cassius Cash was appointed as the first African-American superintendent of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He is the 16th superintendent of the park.[50]\n\n\nIn 2023, the national park will be featured on a USPS Priority Mail Express stamp depicting a scene near the Newfound Gap. The stamp was designed by USPS art director Greg Breeding, with art from Dan Cosgrove.[51]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Great Smoky Mountains Association\n* Great Smoky Mountains Heritage Center\n* Wildflowers of the Great Smoky Mountains\n* List of birds of Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n* List of national parks of the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Great Smoky Mountains in United States of America Archived 24 July 2019 at the Wayback Machine. *protectedplanet.net*.

The park straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are a division of the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The park contains some of the highest mountains in eastern North America, including Clingmans Dome, Mount Guyot, and Mount Le Conte. The border between the two states runs northeast to southwest through the center of the park. The Appalachian Trail passes through the center of the park on its route from Georgia to Maine. With 14.1 million visitors in 2021, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited national park in the United States.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nMap Highlighting the Park's Boundaries\n\nThe park encompasses 522,419 acres (816.28 sq mi; 211,415.47 ha; 2,114.15 km2), making it one of the largest protected areas in the eastern United States.[3] The main park entrances are located along U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road) in the towns of Gatlinburg, Tennessee and Cherokee, North Carolina, and also in Townsend, Tennessee. The park is internationally recognized for its mountains, waterfalls, biodiversity, and forests.[7] In addition, the park preserves multiple historical structures that were part of communities occupied by early European-American settlers of the area.[8]\n\n\nThe park was chartered by the United States Congress in 1934, and officially dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. The Great Smoky Mountains was the first national park having land and other costs paid in part with federal funds; previous parks were funded wholly with state money or private funds.[9] The park was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and an International Biosphere Reserve in 1988.[10]\n\n\nAs the most visited national park in the United States, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park anchors a large tourism industry based in Sevier County, Tennessee adjacent to the park. Major attractions include Dollywood, the second-most visited tourist attraction in Tennessee, Ober Gatlinburg, and Ripley's Aquarium of the Smokies. Tourism to the park contributes an estimated $2.5 billion annually into the local economy.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor thousands of years, this region was occupied by successive cultures of indigenous peoples. The historic Cherokee had their homeland here, and occupied numerous towns in the river valleys on both sides of the Appalachian Mountains. Their first encounters with Europeans were as traders, mostly coming from the colonial Carolinas and Virginia.\n\n\nEuropean Americans did not begin to settle here until the late 18th and early 19th centuries.[12] Particularly because of their pressure to acquire land in the Deep South, in 1830 President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, beginning the process that eventually resulted in the forced removal of all Indian tribes east of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).\n\n\nMost of the Cherokee were also removed. For a period some, led by such warriors as Tsali, evaded removal by staying in the area now part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A band on the Oconaluftee River acquired land and also remained. Their descendants make up most of the federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, based in Cherokee, North Carolina, and their Qualla Boundary reserve to the south of the park.\n\n\n\n![](image)Clearcut logging in the Blue Ridge Mountains in Tennessee, 1936\nJohn Mingus, who built the Mingus Mill, and Ralph Hughes settled on the Oconaluftee in 1795. Other settlers soon followed and began clearing land and farming. In 1818, John Oliver and his family were the first white settlers to move into Cades Cove. After 1821, more families settled in Cades Cove including the Jobes, Gregorys, Sparkes, and Cables. As the community began to grow, the Cades Cove Baptist Church was established in 1827.[13]\n\n\nAs white settlers arrived, entrepreneurs developed logging as a major industry in the mountains. The Little River Railroad was constructed by Colonel W. B. Townsend[13] in the late-19th century to haul timber out of the remote regions of the area. Colonel Townsend had purchased 86,000 acres of land on the Little River. The construction of the Little River Railroad set an example for larger companies like the Ritter Lumber Company, Montvale Timber Company, and Norwood Lumber to also purchase acres of land for logging. The logging company Champion purchased 92,000 acres (37,000 ha) of land which included the Greenbrier Cove area and areas from Clingman's Dome to Mount Kephart. By 1909 logging was at its peak and by 1920 about two-thirds of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park area had been logged or burned by fires from logging operations.[13]\n\n\nBecause cut-and-run-style clearcutting was destroying the natural beauty of the area, by the 20th century visitors and locals banded together to raise money for preservation of the land. The U.S. National Park Service wanted a park in the eastern United States, but did not have much money to establish one. David C. Chapman; a Knoxville, Tennessee, business leader; was appointed in 1925 to head a commission to establish a national park here. Congress authorized the park in 1926, but there was no nucleus of federally owned land around which to develop it. John D. Rockefeller Jr. contributed $5 million, the U.S. government added $2 million, and private citizens from Tennessee and North Carolina pitched in to assemble the land for the park, piece by piece.\n\n\nSlowly, mountain homesteaders, miners, and loggers were evicted from the land. Farms and timbering operations were abolished to establish the protected areas of the park. Travel writer Horace Kephart, for whom Mount Kephart was named, and photographers Jim Thompson and George Masa were instrumental in fostering the development of the park.[9][14] Ben W. Hooper, a former governor of Tennessee, was the principal land purchasing agent for the park,[15] which was officially established on June 15, 1934. During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works Progress Administration, and other federal organizations hired workers to build trails, fire watchtowers, and other infrastructure improvements to the park and Smoky Mountains.\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe majority of rocks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are Late Precambrian rocks that are part of the Ocoee Supergroup. This group consists of metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites, schists, and slate. Early Precambrian rocks are not only the oldest rocks in the park but also the dominant rock type in sites such as the Raven Fork Valley and upper Tuckasegee River between Cherokee and Bryson City. They primarily consist of metamorphic gneiss, granite, and schist. Cambrian sedimentary rocks can be found among the bottom of the Foothills to the northwest, and in limestone coves such as Cades Cove.[16] One of the most visited attractions in the mountains is Cades Cove, which is a window or an area where older rocks made out of sandstone surround the valley floor of younger rocks made out of limestone.\n\n\nThe oldest rocks in the Smokies are the Precambrian gneiss and schists which were formed over a billion years ago from the accumulation of marine sediments and igneous rock. In the Late Precambrian, the primordial ocean expanded and the more recent Ocoee Supergroup rocks formed from the accumulation of eroding land mass onto the continental shelf. In the Paleozoic Era, the ocean deposited a thick layer of marine sediments which left behind sedimentary rock. During the Ordovician Period, the collision of the North American and African tectonic plates initiated the Alleghenian orogeny that created the Appalachian range. During the Mesozoic Era rapid erosion of softer sedimentary rocks re-exposed the older Ocoee Supergroup formations.[17]\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The observation tower at Clingmans Dome, the highest point in the national park\nElevations in the park range from about 875 feet (267 m) to 6,643 feet (2,025 m) at the summit of Clingmans Dome. Within the park a total of sixteen mountains reach higher than 5,000 feet (1,520 m).[18]\n\n\nThe wide range of elevations mimics the latitudinal changes found throughout the entire eastern United States. Ascending the mountains is comparable to a trip from Tennessee to Canada. Plants and animals common in the country's Northeast have found suitable ecological niches in the park's higher elevations, while southern species find homes in the balmier lower reaches.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Great Smoky Mountains National Park has two climate types: humid subtropical (Cfa), and temperate oceanic (Cfb).[*citation needed*] The plant hardiness zone at Clingmans Dome Visitor Center is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of −14.3 °F (−25.7 °C).[19]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Clingmans Dome Visitor Center, North Carolina (1981–2010 averages).

Annual precipitation amounts range from 50–80 in (1,300–2,000 mm),[22] with heavy winter snowfall in the higher elevations.[23] Flash flooding often occurs after heavy rain.[22]\n\n\nThe average temperature difference between the mountains, such as Newfound Gap at 5,048 ft (1,539 m) above MSL, and the valleys at about 1,600 ft (488 m), is between 10–13 °F (5.6–7.2 °C) for highs, and between 3–6 °F (1.7–3.3 °C) for lows. The difference between high temperatures is similar to the moist adiabatic lapse rate of 3.3 °F (1.8 °C) per 1,000 ft (300 m), while the smaller difference between low temperatures is the result of frequent temperature inversions developing in the morning, most often in autumn.[24]\n\n\nStrong damaging winds of 80–100 mph (130–160 km/h) or higher occur a few times each year around the Smoky Mountains, mainly during the cool season from October to April, as a result of a phenomenon known as mountain waves.[25] Mountain waves are strongest in a narrow area along the foothills, and can create extensive areas of fallen trees and roof damage, especially around Cades Cove and Cove Mountain.[26] Strong winds created by mountain waves were a contributing factor in the devastating Gatlinburg fire on November 28, 2016, during the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires.[27] Damaging winds can also be generated by strong thunderstorms, with tornadoes and strong thunderstorm complexes (also known as mesoscale convective systems) occasionally affecting the Smoky Mountains.[28]\n\n\n\n### Air pollution[edit]\n\n\nThe park is affected by air pollution because of increased development. In a 2004 report by the National Parks Conservation Association, Great Smoky Mountains National Park was considered the most polluted national park. From 1999 to 2003, the park recorded approximately 150 unhealthy air days, the equivalent of about one month of unhealthy air days per year.[29][30] In 2013, Colorado State University reported that, due to the passing of the United States Clean Air Act in 1970, and the subsequent implementation of the Acid Rain Program, there had been a \"significant improvement\" to the air quality in the Great Smoky Mountains from 1990 to 2010.[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Biology and ecology[edit]\n\n\nThe park is almost 95 percent forested, and almost 36 percent of it, 187,000 acres (76,000 ha), is estimated by the Park Service to be old growth forest with many trees that predate European settlement of the area.[33] It is one of the largest blocks of deciduous, temperate, old growth forest in North America.\n\n\n\n![](image)Colorful autumn leaves in October 2008\nThe variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of biota. About 19,000 species of organisms are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 100,000 undocumented species may also be present.\n\n\nPark officials count more than 200 species of birds, 50 species of fish, 39 species of reptiles, and 43 species of amphibians, including many lungless salamanders. The park is an important site for salamanders.[34] The park has a noteworthy black bear population, numbering about 1,500.[35] An attempt to reintroduce red wolves into the park in 1991 failed drastically, forcing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services to remove the wolves from the area in 1998. Elk (wapiti) were reintroduced to the park in 2001, three years after the FWS removed the red wolves from the area. Elk are most abundant in the Cataloochee area in the southeastern section of the park.[36]\n\n\nIt is also home to species of mammals such as the raccoon, bobcat, two species of fox, river otter, woodchuck, beaver, two species of squirrel, opossum, coyote, white-tailed deer, chipmunk, two species of skunk, and various species of bats.\n\n\nOver 100 species of trees grow in the park. The lower region forests are dominated by deciduous leafy trees. At higher altitudes, deciduous forests give way to coniferous trees like Fraser fir. In addition, the park has over 1,400 flowering plant species and over 4,000 species of non-flowering plants.\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\nThere have been hundreds of known species of fish living in the area.\n\n\n\n#### List of fish[edit]\n\n\nSource:[37]\n\n\n\n* American gizzard shad\n* Lamoetra appendix\n* Longnose gar\n* Mountain brook lamprey\n* Brook trout\n\n\n## Attractions and activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Alum Cave Trail to the summit of Mount LeConte provides numerous views of the Great Smoky Mountains.\nThe Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a major tourist attraction in the region. It has been the most visited national park for many years, with over 14.1 million recreational visitors (tourists) in 2021.[38] The recreational figure represents nearly twice as many tourists as the Grand Canyon, which received nearly 6 million visitors the same year. Surrounding towns, notably Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Townsend, Tennessee, and Cherokee, Sylva, Maggie Valley, and Bryson City, North Carolina, receive a significant portion of their income from tourism associated with the park.\n\n\nThe two main visitor centers inside the park are Sugarlands Visitors' Center near the Gatlinburg entrance to the park and Oconaluftee Visitor Center near Cherokee, North Carolina, at the eastern entrance to the park. These ranger stations provide exhibits on wildlife, geology, and the history of the park. They also sell books, maps, and souvenirs. Entrance into the park is free.[39]\n\n\nU.S. Highway 441 (known in the park as Newfound Gap Road) bisects the park, providing automobile access to many trailheads and overlooks, most notably that of Newfound Gap. At an elevation of 5,048 feet (1,539 m), it is the lowest gap in the mountains and is situated near the center of the park, on the Tennessee/North Carolina state line, halfway between the border towns of Gatlinburg and Cherokee. It was here that in 1940, from the Rockefeller Memorial, Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the national park. On clear days Newfound Gap offers arguably the most spectacular scenes accessible via highway in the park.\n\n\nLakeview Drive, located along the north shore of Fontana Lake, is a scenic road that was never completed. Split in two segments, it is accessible via either Fontana Dam or Bryson City. It features an unused road tunnel and connects to various hiking and horse-back riding trails in the area.\n\n\nThe park has a number of historical attractions. The most well-preserved of these (and most popular) is Cades Cove, a valley with a number of preserved historic buildings including log cabins, barns, and churches. Cades Cove is the single most frequented destination in the national park. Self-guided automobile and bicycle tours offer the many sightseers a glimpse into the way of life of old-time southern Appalachia. Other historical areas within the park include Roaring Fork, Cataloochee, Elkmont, and the Mountain Farm Museum and Mingus Mill on the Oconaluftee River.\n\n\n\n### Hiking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hiking in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\nThere are 850 miles (1,370 km) of trails and unpaved roads in the park for hiking, including 70 miles (110 km) of the Appalachian Trail.[40] Mount Le Conte is one of the most frequented destinations in the park. Its elevation is 6,593 feet (2,010 m), the third highest summit in the park and, measured from its base to its highest peak, the tallest mountain east of the Mississippi River. Alum Cave Trail is the most heavily used of the five paths en route to the summit. It provides many scenic overlooks and unique natural attractions such as Alum Cave Bluffs and Arch Rock. Hikers may spend a night at the LeConte Lodge, located near the summit, which provides cabins and rooms for rent (except during the winter season). Accessible solely by trail, it is the only private lodging available inside the park.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Chimney Tops was a popular destination for hikers until access was closed due to damage from the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires.\nAnother popular hiking trail led to the pinnacle of the Chimney Tops, so named because of its unique dual-humped peaktops. This short but strenuous trek rewarded nature enthusiasts with a spectacular panorama of the surrounding mountain peaks. It was the flashpoint for the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires, and therefore sustained extensive damage, evident still today in clearly visible burn scars. The peak has been closed to tourists ever since.\n\n\nBoth the Laurel Falls and Clingmans Dome trails offer relatively easy, short, paved paths to their respective destinations. The Laurel Falls Trail leads to a powerful 80-foot (24 m) waterfall, and the Clingmans Dome Trail takes visitors on an uphill climb to a 50 feet (15 m) tall observation deck, which on a clear day offers views for many miles over the Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia mountains.\n\n\nIn addition to day hiking, the national park offers opportunities for backpacking and camping. Camping is allowed only in designated camping areas and shelters. Most of the park's trail shelters are located along the Appalachian Trail or a short distance away on side trails. In addition to the Appalachian Trail shelters used mostly for extended backpacking trips there are three shelters in the park that are not located on the Appalachian Trail. The Mt. LeConte Shelter is located a short distance east of LeConte Lodge on The Boulevard Trail. It can accommodate 12 people per night, and is the only backcountry site in the entire park that has a permanent ban on campfires. The Kephart Shelter is located at the terminus of the Kephart Prong Trail which begins upstream of the Collins Creek Picnic Area. The shelter, situated along a tributary of the Oconaluftee River can accommodate 14 people. Laurel Gap Shelter is one of the more remote shelters in the park. Situated in a Beech forest swag between Balsam High Top and Big Cataloochee Mountain, the Laurel Gap Shelter can accommodate up to 14 people per night. This shelter is a popular base camp for peakbaggers exploring the heart of the Smokies wilderness.\n\n\nDesignated backcountry campsites are scattered throughout the park. A permit, available at ranger stations and via the park website, is required for all backcountry camping. Additionally, reservations are required for all of the shelters and backcountry campsites. A maximum stay of one night, in the case of shelters, or three nights, in the case of campsites, may limit the traveler's itinerary.\n\n\n\n### Other activities[edit]\n\n\nAfter hiking and simple sightseeing, fishing (especially fly fishing) is the most popular activity in the national park. The park's waters have long had a reputation for healthy trout activity as well as challenging fishing terrain. Brook trout are native to the waters, while both brown and rainbow were introduced to the area. Partially due to the fact of recent droughts killing off the native fish, there are strict regulations regarding how fishing may be conducted. Horseback riding (offered by the national park and on limited trails), bicycling (available for rent in Cades Cove) and water tubing are all also practiced within the park.\n\n\nFrom late May to early June, the Elkmont area of the park hosts the peak display period for synchronous fireflies (*Photinus carolinus*), one of at least 19 species of fireflies that live in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[41] They are the only species in America whose individuals can synchronize their flashing light patterns.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cades Cove panorama\n## Historic areas within the national park[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of historical structures maintained by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\n![](image)The Becky Cable house in the Cades Cove Historic District was built in 1879.\nThe park service maintains four historic districts and one archaeological district within park boundaries, as well as nine individual listings on the National Register of Historic Places. Notable structures not listed include the Mountain Farm Museum buildings at Oconaluftee and buildings in the Cataloochee area. The Mingus Mill (in Oconaluftee) and Smoky Mountain Hiking Club cabin in Greenbrier have been deemed eligible for listing.\n\n\n\n### Historic districts[edit]\n\n\n* Cades Cove Historic District\n* Elkmont Historic District\n* Oconaluftee Archaeological District\n* Noah Ogle Place\n* Roaring Fork Historic District\n\n\n### Individual listings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The John Ownby Cabin in The Sugarlands valley was built in 1860.\n* Alex Cole Cabin\n* Clingmans Dome Observation Tower\n* Hall Cabin (in Hazel Creek area)\n* John Messer Barn\n* John Ownby Cabin\n* Oconaluftee Baptist Church (also called Smokemont Baptist Church)\n* Tyson McCarter Place\n* Mayna Treanor Avent Studio\n* Little Greenbrier School\n* Walker Sisters Place\n\n\n## Cultural importance[edit]\n\n\nThe park was used for filming scenes of Disney's hit 1950s TV series *Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier*.\n\n\nThis park was designated an International Biosphere Reserve in 1976, was certified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and became a part of the Southern Appalachian Biosphere Reserve in 1988.[43]\n\n\nA 75th anniversary re-dedication ceremony was held on 2 September 2009. Among those in attendance were the four U.S. senators from Tennessee and North Carolina, the three US Representatives whose districts include the park, the governors of both states, and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. Dolly Parton, Tennessee native, singer, and actress also attended and performed.[44]\n\n\nIn late November and early December 2016, a series of wildfires engulfed a total of 17,900 acres (72 km2) in the park and surrounding areas. The wildfires killed at least 14, injured 190, and forced the evacuation of more than 14,000 people.[45] The fires also damaged or destroyed at least 2,000 structures. The fires, which were initially suspected to have been caused by arson, occurred during a period of unusual drought, which accelerated the fires. The wildfires were the deadliest in the Eastern United States since the Great Fires of 1947, and comprised one of the worst natural disasters in the history of Tennessee.[46][47][48][49]\n\n\nIn 2015 Cassius Cash was appointed as the first African-American superintendent of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He is the 16th superintendent of the park.[50]\n\n\nIn 2023, the national park will be featured on a USPS Priority Mail Express stamp depicting a scene near the Newfound Gap. The stamp was designed by USPS art director Greg Breeding, with art from Dan Cosgrove.[51]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Great Smoky Mountains Association\n* Great Smoky Mountains Heritage Center\n* Wildflowers of the Great Smoky Mountains\n* List of birds of Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n* List of national parks of the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Great Smoky Mountains in United States of America Archived 24 July 2019 at the Wayback Machine. *protectedplanet.net*.

The park's central feature is the Grand Canyon, a gorge of the Colorado River, which is often considered one of the Wonders of the World. The park, which covers 1,217,262 acres (1,901.972 sq mi; 4,926.08 km2) of unincorporated area in Coconino and Mohave counties, received more than 4.7 million recreational visitors in 2022, which is the second highest count of all American national parks after Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[5] The Grand Canyon was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. The park celebrated its 100th anniversary on February 26, 2019.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1938 poster of the park\nThe Grand Canyon became well known to Americans in the 1880s after railroads were built and pioneers developed infrastructure and early tourism.[7] In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt visited the site and said, \n\n\n> The Grand Canyon fills me with awe. It is beyond comparison—beyond description; absolutely unparalleled through-out the wide world ... Let this great wonder of nature remain as it now is. Do nothing to mar its grandeur, sublimity and loveliness. You cannot improve on it. But you can keep it for your children, your children's children, and all who come after you, as the one great sight which every American should see.[8]\n> \n> \n\n\nDespite Roosevelt's enthusiasm and strong interest in preserving land for public use, the Grand Canyon was not immediately designated as a national park. The first bill to establish Grand Canyon National Park was introduced in 1882 by then-Senator Benjamin Harrison, which would have established Grand Canyon as the third national park in the United States, after Yellowstone and Mackinac. Harrison unsuccessfully reintroduced his bill in 1883 and 1886; after his election to the presidency, he established the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve in 1893. Theodore Roosevelt created the Grand Canyon Game Preserve by proclamation on November 28, 1906,[9] and the Grand Canyon National Monument on January 11, 1908.[10] Further Senate bills to establish the site as a national park were introduced and defeated in 1910 and 1911, before the Grand Canyon National Park Act (Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 65–277) was finally signed by President Woodrow Wilson on February 26, 1919.[11] The National Park Service, established in 1916, assumed administration of the park.\n\n\nThe creation of the park was an early success of the conservation movement. Its national park status may have helped thwart proposals to dam the Colorado River within its boundaries. (Later, the Glen Canyon Dam would be built upriver.) A second Grand Canyon National Monument to the west was proclaimed in 1932.[12] In 1975, that monument and Marble Canyon National Monument, which was established in 1969 and followed the Colorado River northeast from the Grand Canyon to Lees Ferry, were made part of Grand Canyon National Park. In 1979, UNESCO declared the park a World Heritage Site. The 1987 the National Parks Overflights Act[13] found that\n\"Noise associated with aircraft overflights at the Grand Canyon National Park is causing a significant adverse effect on the natural quiet and experience of the park and current aircraft operations at the Grand Canyon National Park have raised serious concerns regarding public safety, including concerns regarding the safety of park users.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)Grand Canyon Quarter\nIn 2010, Grand Canyon National Park was honored with its own coin under the America the Beautiful Quarters program.[14] On February 26, 2019, the Grand Canyon National Park commemorated 100 years since its designation as a national park.[15]\n\n\nThe Grand Canyon had been part of the National Park Service's Intermountain Region until 2018.[*citation needed*] Today, the Grand Canyon is a part of Region 8, also known as the Lower Colorado Basin.[16]\n\n\n\n### Legal history timeline[edit]\n\n\n* **1882** First unsuccessful attempt to establish a Grand Canyon National Park\n* **1893** Designated a \"forest reserve\" by President Benjamin Harrison (Presidential Proclamation #45)\n* **1908** Established as Grand Canyon National Monument by President Theodore Roosevelt (Presidential Proclamation #794)\n* **1919** Designation of Grand Canyon National Park by an act of Congress on February 26 (40 Stat 1175)\n* **1975** Grand Canyon National Park Enlargement Act an act of Congress on January 3 (88 Stat 2089) (Pub.

The canyon itself was created by the incision of the Colorado River and its tributaries after the Colorado Plateau was uplifted, causing the Colorado River system to develop along its present path.\n\n\nThe primary public areas of the park are the South and North Rims, and adjacent areas of the canyon itself. The rest of the park is extremely rugged and remote, although many places are accessible by pack trail and backcountry roads. The South Rim is more accessible than the North Rim and accounts for 90% of park visitation.[19]\n\n\nThe park headquarters are at Grand Canyon Village, not far from the South Entrance to the park, near one of the most popular viewpoints.\n\n\n\n### South Rim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From Powell Point on the South Rim\nMost visitors to the park come to the South Rim, arriving on Arizona State Route 64. The highway enters the park through the South Entrance, near Tusayan, Arizona, and heads eastward, leaving the park through the East Entrance.[20] Interstate 40 provides access to the area from the south. From the north, U.S. Route 89 connects Utah, Colorado, and the North Rim to the South Rim.[21] Overall, some 30 miles of the South Rim are accessible by road.[22][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Services[edit]\n\n\nGrand Canyon Village is the primary visitor services area in the park. It is a full-service community, including lodging, fuel, food, souvenirs, a hospital, churches, and access to trails and guided walks and talks.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Lodging[edit]\n\n\nSeveral lodging facilities are available along the South Rim.[24] Hotels and other lodging include El Tovar, Bright Angel Lodge, Kachina Lodge, Thunderbird Lodge, and Maswik Lodge, all of which are located in Grand Canyon Village, and Phantom Ranch, located on the canyon floor.[24] There is also an RV Park named Trailer Village. All of these facilities are managed by Xanterra Parks & Resorts, while the Yavapai Lodge (also in the village area) is managed by Delaware North.[24]\n\n\n\n### North Rim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sunset at Cape Royal Point, North Rim. Wotans Throne featured.\nThe North Rim area of the park is located on the Kaibab Plateau and Walhalla Plateau, directly across the Grand Canyon from the principal visitor areas on the South Rim. The North Rim's principal visitor areas are centered around Bright Angel Point. The North Rim is higher in elevation than the South Rim, at over 8,000 feet (2,400 m) of elevation. Because it is so much higher than the South Rim, it is closed from December 1 through May 15 each year, due to the enhanced snowfall at elevation. Visitor services are closed or limited in scope after October 15. Driving time from the South Rim to the North Rim is about 4.5 hours, over 220 miles (350 km).\n[19]\n\n\nOn the North Rim is the historic Grand Canyon Lodge,[24] managed by Forever Resorts, and a campground near the lodge managed by the national park staff.[25]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Grand Canyon National Park has five climate zones; Cold Semi-Arid (*BSk*), Humid Continental Dry Cool Summer (*Dsb*), Humid Continental Dry Warm Summer (*Dsa*), Warm Summer Mediterranean (*Csb*), and Hot Summer Mediterranean (*Csa*). The plant hardiness zone at Grand Canyon Visitor Center is 7a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of 3.3 °F (−15.9 °C).[26]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Grand Canyon NP 2, Arizona, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1976–2012\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 64(18)\n | 69(21)\n | 77(25)\n | 82(28)\n | 92(33)\n | 101(38)\n | 97(36)\n | 97(36)\n | 93(34)\n | 89(32)\n | 74(23)\n | 65(18)\n | 101(38)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 57.1(13.9)\n | 59.4(15.2)\n | 65.9(18.8)\n | 74.4(23.6)\n | 83.0(28.3)\n | 90.9(32.7)\n | 94.0(34.4)\n | 90.1(32.3)\n | 85.3(29.6)\n | 76.1(24.5)\n | 65.9(18.8)\n | 58.2(14.6)\n | 94.0(34.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 44.3(6.8)\n | 46.3(7.9)\n | 53.6(12.0)\n | 60.9(16.1)\n | 69.9(21.1)\n | 82.0(27.8)\n | 84.9(29.4)\n | 82.1(27.8)\n | 75.8(24.3)\n | 64.6(18.1)\n | 53.2(11.8)\n | 43.0(6.1)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 31.7(−0.2)\n | 33.7(0.9)\n | 39.3(4.1)\n | 44.9(7.2)\n | 52.8(11.6)\n | 62.5(16.9)\n | 67.7(19.8)\n | 65.9(18.8)\n | 59.8(15.4)\n | 49.0(9.4)\n | 39.0(3.9)\n | 30.6(−0.8)\n | 48.1(8.9)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 19.2(−7.1)\n | 21.1(−6.1)\n | 25.0(−3.9)\n | 28.8(−1.8)\n | 35.6(2.0)\n | 43.0(6.1)\n | 50.4(10.2)\n | 49.8(9.9)\n | 43.7(6.5)\n | 33.3(0.7)\n | 24.7(−4.1)\n | 18.2(−7.7)\n | 32.7(0.4)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 0.0(−17.8)\n | 3.1(−16.1)\n | 10.6(−11.9)\n | 18.2(−7.7)\n | 25.1(−3.8)\n | 31.2(−0.4)\n | 41.0(5.0)\n | 41.6(5.3)\n | 32.7(0.4)\n | 20.8(−6.2)\n | 7.6(−13.6)\n | 1.9(−16.7)\n | −3.6(−19.8)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −17(−27)\n | −20(−29)\n | −1(−18)\n | 8(−13)\n | 17(−8)\n | 25(−4)\n | 35(2)\n | 35(2)\n | 24(−4)\n | 8(−13)\n | −6(−21)\n | −20(−29)\n | −20(−29)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 1.76(45)\n | 1.23(31)\n | 1.85(47)\n | 0.64(16)\n | 0.40(10)\n | 0.22(5.6)\n | 2.33(59)\n | 2.19(56)\n | 1.50(38)\n | 1.23(31)\n | 0.77(20)\n | 1.25(32)\n | 15.37(390)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 12.9(33)\n | 7.8(20)\n | 8.1(21)\n | 2.8(7.1)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 1.1(2.8)\n | 2.2(5.6)\n | 8.0(20)\n | 43.0(109)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 6.4\n | 6.1\n | 5.9\n | 3.5\n | 2.6\n | 1.7\n | 7.0\n | 10.1\n | 5.7\n | 5.1\n | 4.0\n | 6.0\n | 64.1\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 4.0\n | 3.3\n | 2.9\n | 1.2\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.7\n | 1.3\n | 3.5\n | 17.0\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 217.0\n | 226.0\n | 279.0\n | 330.0\n | 372.0\n | 390.0\n | 341.0\n | 341.0\n | 300.0\n | 279.0\n | 240.0\n | 217.0\n | 3,532\n |\n| Mean daily sunshine hours | 7\n | 8\n | 9\n | 11\n | 12\n | 13\n | 11\n | 11\n | 10\n | 9\n | 8\n | 7\n | 10\n |\n| Mean daily daylight hours | 10.0\n | 10.9\n | 12.0\n | 13.1\n | 14.1\n | 14.6\n | 14.3\n | 13.5\n | 12.4\n | 11.3\n | 10.3\n | 9.8\n | 12.2\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 70\n | 73\n | 75\n | 84\n | 85\n | 89\n | 77\n | 81\n | 81\n | 80\n | 78\n | 71\n | 79\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 3\n | 4\n | 6\n | 8\n | 10\n | 11\n | 11\n | 10\n | 8\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 7\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA (mean maxima, minima 1981–2010)[27][28] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (sun data)[29] |\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\n### North Rim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From Toroweap Overlook on the North Rim\nThere are few roads on the North Rim, but there are some notable vehicle-accessible lookout points, including Point Imperial, Roosevelt Point, and Cape Royal. Mule rides are also available to a variety of places, including several thousand feet down into the canyon.\n\n\nMany visitors to the North Rim choose to make use of the variety of hiking trails including the Widforss Trail, Uncle Jim's Trail, the Transept Trail, and the North Kaibab Trail. The North Kaibab Trail can be followed all the way down to the Colorado River, connecting across the river to the South Kaibab Trail and the Bright Angel Trail, which continue up to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.\n\n\nThe Toroweap Overlook is located in the western part of the park on the North Rim. Access is via unpaved roads off Route 389 west of Fredonia, Arizona. The roads lead through Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument and to the overlook.\n\n\n\n### South Rim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From Desert View on the South Rim\nA variety of activities at the South Rim cater to park visitors. A driving tour (35 miles (56 km)) along the South Rim is split into two segments. The western drive to Hermit's Point is eight miles (13 km) with several overlooks along the way, including Mohave Point, Hopi Point, and the Powell Memorial.[23] From March to December, access to Hermit's Rest is restricted to the free shuttle provided by the Park Service. The eastern portion to Desert View is 25 miles (40 km), and is open to private vehicles year round.\n\n\nWalking tours include the Rim Trail, which runs west from the Pipe Creek viewpoint for about eight miles (13 km) of paved road, followed by seven miles (11 km) unpaved to Hermit's Rest. Hikes can begin almost anywhere along this trail, and a shuttle can return hikers to their point of origin. Mather Point, the first view most people reach when entering from the south entrance, is a popular place to begin.\n\n\nPrivate canyon flyovers are provided by helicopters and small airplanes out of Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Grand Canyon National Park Airport. Due to a crash in the 1990s, scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within 1,500 feet (460 m) of the rim within the Grand Canyon National Park.[30] Flights within the canyon are still available outside of park boundaries.[31]\n\n\n\n## Grand Canyon Conservancy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grand Canyon Conservancy\n\nThe Grand Canyon Association (GCA) is the National Park Service's official nonprofit partner. It raises private funds to benefit Grand Canyon National Park by operating retail shops and visitor centers within the park, and providing educational opportunities about the natural and cultural history of the region. Its goals include:\n\n\n\n* Creating Inter-tribal cultural sites\n* Dark Sky Preservation\n* Discovery and exploration of the Park\n* Trail creation and preservation[32]\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic view from the South Rim\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Arizona portal\n\n\n![](image) Media related to Grand Canyon at Wikimedia Commons (image gallery)\n\n\n\n* List of trails in Grand Canyon National Park\n* List of national parks of the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Grand Canyon in United States of America Archived July 24, 2019, at the Wayback Machine. *protectedplanet.net*.

The park's central feature is the Grand Canyon, a gorge of the Colorado River, which is often considered one of the Wonders of the World. The park, which covers 1,217,262 acres (1,901.972 sq mi; 4,926.08 km2) of unincorporated area in Coconino and Mohave counties, received more than 4.7 million recreational visitors in 2022, which is the second highest count of all American national parks after Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[5] The Grand Canyon was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. The park celebrated its 100th anniversary on February 26, 2019.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1938 poster of the park\nThe Grand Canyon became well known to Americans in the 1880s after railroads were built and pioneers developed infrastructure and early tourism.[7] In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt visited the site and said, \n\n\n> The Grand Canyon fills me with awe. It is beyond comparison—beyond description; absolutely unparalleled through-out the wide world ... Let this great wonder of nature remain as it now is. Do nothing to mar its grandeur, sublimity and loveliness. You cannot improve on it. But you can keep it for your children, your children's children, and all who come after you, as the one great sight which every American should see.[8]\n> \n> \n\n\nDespite Roosevelt's enthusiasm and strong interest in preserving land for public use, the Grand Canyon was not immediately designated as a national park. The first bill to establish Grand Canyon National Park was introduced in 1882 by then-Senator Benjamin Harrison, which would have established Grand Canyon as the third national park in the United States, after Yellowstone and Mackinac. Harrison unsuccessfully reintroduced his bill in 1883 and 1886; after his election to the presidency, he established the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve in 1893. Theodore Roosevelt created the Grand Canyon Game Preserve by proclamation on November 28, 1906,[9] and the Grand Canyon National Monument on January 11, 1908.[10] Further Senate bills to establish the site as a national park were introduced and defeated in 1910 and 1911, before the Grand Canyon National Park Act (Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 65–277) was finally signed by President Woodrow Wilson on February 26, 1919.[11] The National Park Service, established in 1916, assumed administration of the park.\n\n\nThe creation of the park was an early success of the conservation movement. Its national park status may have helped thwart proposals to dam the Colorado River within its boundaries. (Later, the Glen Canyon Dam would be built upriver.) A second Grand Canyon National Monument to the west was proclaimed in 1932.[12] In 1975, that monument and Marble Canyon National Monument, which was established in 1969 and followed the Colorado River northeast from the Grand Canyon to Lees Ferry, were made part of Grand Canyon National Park. In 1979, UNESCO declared the park a World Heritage Site. The 1987 the National Parks Overflights Act[13] found that\n\"Noise associated with aircraft overflights at the Grand Canyon National Park is causing a significant adverse effect on the natural quiet and experience of the park and current aircraft operations at the Grand Canyon National Park have raised serious concerns regarding public safety, including concerns regarding the safety of park users.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)Grand Canyon Quarter\nIn 2010, Grand Canyon National Park was honored with its own coin under the America the Beautiful Quarters program.[14] On February 26, 2019, the Grand Canyon National Park commemorated 100 years since its designation as a national park.[15]\n\n\nThe Grand Canyon had been part of the National Park Service's Intermountain Region until 2018.[*citation needed*] Today, the Grand Canyon is a part of Region 8, also known as the Lower Colorado Basin.[16]\n\n\n\n### Legal history timeline[edit]\n\n\n* **1882** First unsuccessful attempt to establish a Grand Canyon National Park\n* **1893** Designated a \"forest reserve\" by President Benjamin Harrison (Presidential Proclamation #45)\n* **1908** Established as Grand Canyon National Monument by President Theodore Roosevelt (Presidential Proclamation #794)\n* **1919** Designation of Grand Canyon National Park by an act of Congress on February 26 (40 Stat 1175)\n* **1975** Grand Canyon National Park Enlargement Act an act of Congress on January 3 (88 Stat 2089) (Pub.

The canyon itself was created by the incision of the Colorado River and its tributaries after the Colorado Plateau was uplifted, causing the Colorado River system to develop along its present path.\n\n\nThe primary public areas of the park are the South and North Rims, and adjacent areas of the canyon itself. The rest of the park is extremely rugged and remote, although many places are accessible by pack trail and backcountry roads. The South Rim is more accessible than the North Rim and accounts for 90% of park visitation.[19]\n\n\nThe park headquarters are at Grand Canyon Village, not far from the South Entrance to the park, near one of the most popular viewpoints.\n\n\n\n### South Rim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From Powell Point on the South Rim\nMost visitors to the park come to the South Rim, arriving on Arizona State Route 64. The highway enters the park through the South Entrance, near Tusayan, Arizona, and heads eastward, leaving the park through the East Entrance.[20] Interstate 40 provides access to the area from the south. From the north, U.S. Route 89 connects Utah, Colorado, and the North Rim to the South Rim.[21] Overall, some 30 miles of the South Rim are accessible by road.[22][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Services[edit]\n\n\nGrand Canyon Village is the primary visitor services area in the park. It is a full-service community, including lodging, fuel, food, souvenirs, a hospital, churches, and access to trails and guided walks and talks.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Lodging[edit]\n\n\nSeveral lodging facilities are available along the South Rim.[24] Hotels and other lodging include El Tovar, Bright Angel Lodge, Kachina Lodge, Thunderbird Lodge, and Maswik Lodge, all of which are located in Grand Canyon Village, and Phantom Ranch, located on the canyon floor.[24] There is also an RV Park named Trailer Village. All of these facilities are managed by Xanterra Parks & Resorts, while the Yavapai Lodge (also in the village area) is managed by Delaware North.[24]\n\n\n\n### North Rim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sunset at Cape Royal Point, North Rim. Wotans Throne featured.\nThe North Rim area of the park is located on the Kaibab Plateau and Walhalla Plateau, directly across the Grand Canyon from the principal visitor areas on the South Rim. The North Rim's principal visitor areas are centered around Bright Angel Point. The North Rim is higher in elevation than the South Rim, at over 8,000 feet (2,400 m) of elevation. Because it is so much higher than the South Rim, it is closed from December 1 through May 15 each year, due to the enhanced snowfall at elevation. Visitor services are closed or limited in scope after October 15. Driving time from the South Rim to the North Rim is about 4.5 hours, over 220 miles (350 km).\n[19]\n\n\nOn the North Rim is the historic Grand Canyon Lodge,[24] managed by Forever Resorts, and a campground near the lodge managed by the national park staff.[25]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Grand Canyon National Park has five climate zones; Cold Semi-Arid (*BSk*), Humid Continental Dry Cool Summer (*Dsb*), Humid Continental Dry Warm Summer (*Dsa*), Warm Summer Mediterranean (*Csb*), and Hot Summer Mediterranean (*Csa*). The plant hardiness zone at Grand Canyon Visitor Center is 7a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of 3.3 °F (−15.9 °C).[26]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Grand Canyon NP 2, Arizona, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1976–2012\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 64(18)\n | 69(21)\n | 77(25)\n | 82(28)\n | 92(33)\n | 101(38)\n | 97(36)\n | 97(36)\n | 93(34)\n | 89(32)\n | 74(23)\n | 65(18)\n | 101(38)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 57.1(13.9)\n | 59.4(15.2)\n | 65.9(18.8)\n | 74.4(23.6)\n | 83.0(28.3)\n | 90.9(32.7)\n | 94.0(34.4)\n | 90.1(32.3)\n | 85.3(29.6)\n | 76.1(24.5)\n | 65.9(18.8)\n | 58.2(14.6)\n | 94.0(34.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 44.3(6.8)\n | 46.3(7.9)\n | 53.6(12.0)\n | 60.9(16.1)\n | 69.9(21.1)\n | 82.0(27.8)\n | 84.9(29.4)\n | 82.1(27.8)\n | 75.8(24.3)\n | 64.6(18.1)\n | 53.2(11.8)\n | 43.0(6.1)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 31.7(−0.2)\n | 33.7(0.9)\n | 39.3(4.1)\n | 44.9(7.2)\n | 52.8(11.6)\n | 62.5(16.9)\n | 67.7(19.8)\n | 65.9(18.8)\n | 59.8(15.4)\n | 49.0(9.4)\n | 39.0(3.9)\n | 30.6(−0.8)\n | 48.1(8.9)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 19.2(−7.1)\n | 21.1(−6.1)\n | 25.0(−3.9)\n | 28.8(−1.8)\n | 35.6(2.0)\n | 43.0(6.1)\n | 50.4(10.2)\n | 49.8(9.9)\n | 43.7(6.5)\n | 33.3(0.7)\n | 24.7(−4.1)\n | 18.2(−7.7)\n | 32.7(0.4)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 0.0(−17.8)\n | 3.1(−16.1)\n | 10.6(−11.9)\n | 18.2(−7.7)\n | 25.1(−3.8)\n | 31.2(−0.4)\n | 41.0(5.0)\n | 41.6(5.3)\n | 32.7(0.4)\n | 20.8(−6.2)\n | 7.6(−13.6)\n | 1.9(−16.7)\n | −3.6(−19.8)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −17(−27)\n | −20(−29)\n | −1(−18)\n | 8(−13)\n | 17(−8)\n | 25(−4)\n | 35(2)\n | 35(2)\n | 24(−4)\n | 8(−13)\n | −6(−21)\n | −20(−29)\n | −20(−29)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 1.76(45)\n | 1.23(31)\n | 1.85(47)\n | 0.64(16)\n | 0.40(10)\n | 0.22(5.6)\n | 2.33(59)\n | 2.19(56)\n | 1.50(38)\n | 1.23(31)\n | 0.77(20)\n | 1.25(32)\n | 15.37(390)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 12.9(33)\n | 7.8(20)\n | 8.1(21)\n | 2.8(7.1)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 1.1(2.8)\n | 2.2(5.6)\n | 8.0(20)\n | 43.0(109)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 6.4\n | 6.1\n | 5.9\n | 3.5\n | 2.6\n | 1.7\n | 7.0\n | 10.1\n | 5.7\n | 5.1\n | 4.0\n | 6.0\n | 64.1\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 4.0\n | 3.3\n | 2.9\n | 1.2\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.7\n | 1.3\n | 3.5\n | 17.0\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 217.0\n | 226.0\n | 279.0\n | 330.0\n | 372.0\n | 390.0\n | 341.0\n | 341.0\n | 300.0\n | 279.0\n | 240.0\n | 217.0\n | 3,532\n |\n| Mean daily sunshine hours | 7\n | 8\n | 9\n | 11\n | 12\n | 13\n | 11\n | 11\n | 10\n | 9\n | 8\n | 7\n | 10\n |\n| Mean daily daylight hours | 10.0\n | 10.9\n | 12.0\n | 13.1\n | 14.1\n | 14.6\n | 14.3\n | 13.5\n | 12.4\n | 11.3\n | 10.3\n | 9.8\n | 12.2\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 70\n | 73\n | 75\n | 84\n | 85\n | 89\n | 77\n | 81\n | 81\n | 80\n | 78\n | 71\n | 79\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 3\n | 4\n | 6\n | 8\n | 10\n | 11\n | 11\n | 10\n | 8\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 7\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA (mean maxima, minima 1981–2010)[27][28] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (sun data)[29] |\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\n### North Rim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From Toroweap Overlook on the North Rim\nThere are few roads on the North Rim, but there are some notable vehicle-accessible lookout points, including Point Imperial, Roosevelt Point, and Cape Royal. Mule rides are also available to a variety of places, including several thousand feet down into the canyon.\n\n\nMany visitors to the North Rim choose to make use of the variety of hiking trails including the Widforss Trail, Uncle Jim's Trail, the Transept Trail, and the North Kaibab Trail. The North Kaibab Trail can be followed all the way down to the Colorado River, connecting across the river to the South Kaibab Trail and the Bright Angel Trail, which continue up to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.\n\n\nThe Toroweap Overlook is located in the western part of the park on the North Rim. Access is via unpaved roads off Route 389 west of Fredonia, Arizona. The roads lead through Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument and to the overlook.\n\n\n\n### South Rim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From Desert View on the South Rim\nA variety of activities at the South Rim cater to park visitors. A driving tour (35 miles (56 km)) along the South Rim is split into two segments. The western drive to Hermit's Point is eight miles (13 km) with several overlooks along the way, including Mohave Point, Hopi Point, and the Powell Memorial.[23] From March to December, access to Hermit's Rest is restricted to the free shuttle provided by the Park Service. The eastern portion to Desert View is 25 miles (40 km), and is open to private vehicles year round.\n\n\nWalking tours include the Rim Trail, which runs west from the Pipe Creek viewpoint for about eight miles (13 km) of paved road, followed by seven miles (11 km) unpaved to Hermit's Rest. Hikes can begin almost anywhere along this trail, and a shuttle can return hikers to their point of origin. Mather Point, the first view most people reach when entering from the south entrance, is a popular place to begin.\n\n\nPrivate canyon flyovers are provided by helicopters and small airplanes out of Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Grand Canyon National Park Airport. Due to a crash in the 1990s, scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within 1,500 feet (460 m) of the rim within the Grand Canyon National Park.[30] Flights within the canyon are still available outside of park boundaries.[31]\n\n\n\n## Grand Canyon Conservancy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grand Canyon Conservancy\n\nThe Grand Canyon Association (GCA) is the National Park Service's official nonprofit partner. It raises private funds to benefit Grand Canyon National Park by operating retail shops and visitor centers within the park, and providing educational opportunities about the natural and cultural history of the region. Its goals include:\n\n\n\n* Creating Inter-tribal cultural sites\n* Dark Sky Preservation\n* Discovery and exploration of the Park\n* Trail creation and preservation[32]\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic view from the South Rim\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Arizona portal\n\n\n![](image) Media related to Grand Canyon at Wikimedia Commons (image gallery)\n\n\n\n* List of trails in Grand Canyon National Park\n* List of national parks of the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Grand Canyon in United States of America Archived July 24, 2019, at the Wayback Machine. *protectedplanet.net*.

Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River.\n\n\nHuman habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Ancestral Puebloans (who used to be called Anasazi by early non-indigenous archeologists[4])(c. 300 CE). Subsequently, what has been called the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities.[5] Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. \n\n\n\n\n## Name change[edit]\n\n\nIn 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area **Mukuntuweap National Monument** in order to protect the canyon.[6] In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to **Zion National Monument**, Zion being a term used by the Mormons.[6] According to historian Hal Rothman: \"The name change played to a prevalent bias of the time. Many believed that Spanish and Indian names would deter visitors who, if they could not pronounce the name of a place, might not bother to visit it.[7] The new name, Zion, had greater appeal to an ethnocentric audience.\"[8] On November 19, 1919, Congress redesignated the monument as **Zion National Park**, and the act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson.[9] The Kolob section was proclaimed a separate Zion National Monument in 1937, but was incorporated into the national park in 1956.[10] Congress designated 85% of the park a wilderness area in 2009.\n\n\nThe geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area includes nine formations that together represent 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation. At various periods in that time warm, shallow seas, streams, ponds and lakes, vast deserts, and dry near-shore environments covered the area. Uplift associated with the creation of the Colorado Plateau lifted the region 10,000 feet (3,000 m) starting 13 million years ago.[11]\n\n\n\n## Park purpose[edit]\n\n\nAs stated in the foundation document:[12]\n\n\n\n\n> The purpose of Zion National Park is to preserve the dramatic geology including Zion Canyon and a labyrinth of deep and brilliantly colored Navajo sandstone canyons formed by extraordinary processes of erosion at the margin of the Colorado Plateau; to safeguard the park's wilderness character and its wild and scenic river values; to protect evidence of human history; and to provide for scientific research and the enjoyment and enlightenment of the public.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nThe park is located in southwestern Utah in Washington, Iron and Kane counties. Geomorphically, it is located on the Markagunt and Kolob plateaus, at the intersection of three North American geographic provinces: the Colorado Plateau, the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert. The northern part of the park is known as the **Kolob Canyons** section and is accessible from Interstate 15, exit 40.[13]\n\n\nThe 8,726-foot (2,660 m) summit of Horse Ranch Mountain is the highest point in the park; the lowest point is the 3,666-foot (1,117 m) elevation of Coal Pits Wash, creating a relief of about 5,100 feet (1,600 m).[14]\n\n\nStreams in the area take rectangular paths because they follow jointing planes in the rocks.[15] The stream gradient of the Virgin River, whose North Fork flows through Zion Canyon in the park, ranges from 50 to 80 feet per mile (9.5 to 15.2 m/km) (0.9–1.5%)—one of the steepest stream gradients in North America.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Towers of the Virgin: The Sundial (left), The Witch Head, Broken Tooth, Rotten Tooth, Altar of Sacrifice\nThe road into Zion Canyon is 6 miles (9.7 km) long, ending at the Temple of Sinawava, which is named for the coyote god of the Paiute Indians.[17] The canyon becomes more narrow near the Temple and a hiking trail continues to the mouth of The Narrows, a gorge only 20 feet (6 m) wide and up to 2,000 feet (610 m) tall.[18] The Zion Canyon road is served by a free shuttle bus from early April to late October and by private vehicles the other months of the year. Other roads in Zion are open to private vehicles year-round.\n\n\nThe east side of the park is served by Zion-Mount Carmel Highway (SR-9), which passes through the Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel and ends at US 89 at Mount Carmel Junction. Park features on the east side of the park include Checkerboard Mesa and The East Temple.\n\n\nThe Kolob Terrace area, northwest of Zion Canyon, features a slot canyon called The Subway, and a panoramic view of the entire area from Lava Point. The Kolob Canyons section, further to the northwest near Cedar City, features Tucupit Point and one of the world's longest natural arches, Kolob Arch.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Court of the Patriarchs, by Ansel Adams (1933)\nOther notable geographic features of Zion Canyon include Angels Landing, The Great White Throne, the Court of the Patriarchs, The Sentinel, The West Temple, Towers of the Virgin, the Altar of Sacrifice, The Watchman, Weeping Rock, and the Emerald Pools.[20]\n\n\nSpring weather is unpredictable, with stormy, wet days being common, mixed with occasional warm, sunny weather. Precipitation is normally heaviest in March.[21] Spring wildflowers bloom from April through June, peaking in May. Fall days are usually clear and mild; nights are often cool. Summer days are hot (95 to 110 °F; 35 to 43 °C), but overnight lows are usually comfortable (65 to 70 °F; 18 to 21 °C).[21] Afternoon thunderstorms are common from mid-July through mid-September.[21] Storms may produce waterfalls as well as flash floods. Autumn tree-color displays begin in September in the high country; in Zion Canyon, autumn colors usually peak in late October. Winter in Zion Canyon is fairly mild. Winter storms bring rain or light snow to Zion Canyon and heavier snow to the higher elevations. Clear days may become quite warm, reaching 60 °F (16 °C); nights are often 20 to 40 °F (−7 to 4 °C).[21] Winter storms can last several days and make roads icy. Zion roads are plowed, except the Kolob Terrace Road which is closed when covered with snow.[21] Winter driving conditions last from November through March.[21]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nZion National Park has a *BSk* (Köppen climate classification) cold semi-arid climate consisting of very hot summers and mild winters with a limited amount of precipitation throughout the year.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Zion National Park, Utah, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1904–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 74(23)\n | 97(36)\n | 91(33)\n | 97(36)\n | 106(41)\n | 114(46)\n | 115(46)\n | 112(44)\n | 110(43)\n | 99(37)\n | 90(32)\n | 81(27)\n | 115(46)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 66.3(19.1)\n | 70.3(21.3)\n | 79.8(26.6)\n | 87.8(31.0)\n | 97.0(36.1)\n | 105.6(40.9)\n | 109.4(43.0)\n | 106.5(41.4)\n | 101.5(38.6)\n | 91.6(33.1)\n | 78.7(25.9)\n | 65.6(18.7)\n | 110.1(43.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 57.6(14.2)\n | 66.1(18.9)\n | 73.1(22.8)\n | 83.5(28.6)\n | 95.3(35.2)\n | 100.3(37.9)\n | 98.0(36.7)\n | 90.7(32.6)\n | 78.1(25.6)\n | 63.9(17.7)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 76.1(24.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 42.1(5.6)\n | 45.6(7.6)\n | 52.4(11.3)\n | 58.4(14.7)\n | 68.0(20.0)\n | 78.8(26.0)\n | 84.9(29.4)\n | 83.3(28.5)\n | 76.0(24.4)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 40.9(4.9)\n | 62.0(16.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 30.4(−0.9)\n | 33.6(0.9)\n | 38.7(3.7)\n | 43.8(6.6)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 62.2(16.8)\n | 69.5(20.8)\n | 68.7(20.4)\n | 61.3(16.3)\n | 48.8(9.3)\n | 37.3(2.9)\n | 29.3(−1.5)\n | 48.0(8.9)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 14.9(−9.5)\n | 18.9(−7.3)\n | 24.9(−3.9)\n | 29.1(−1.6)\n | 37.1(2.8)\n | 46.6(8.1)\n | 59.8(15.4)\n | 59.7(15.4)\n | 47.8(8.8)\n | 31.4(−0.3)\n | 19.7(−6.8)\n | 13.5(−10.3)\n | 10.7(−11.8)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −15(−26)\n | 0(−18)\n | 10(−12)\n | 21(−6)\n | 22(−6)\n | 35(2)\n | 41(5)\n | 37(3)\n | 33(1)\n | 13(−11)\n | 0(−18)\n | −5(−21)\n | −15(−26)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 1.99(51)\n | 2.06(52)\n | 2.01(51)\n | 1.22(31)\n | 0.77(20)\n | 0.23(5.8)\n | 1.15(29)\n | 1.63(41)\n | 1.17(30)\n | 1.22(31)\n | 1.18(30)\n | 1.64(42)\n | 16.27(413)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 0.7(1.8)\n | 0.8(2.0)\n | 0.7(1.8)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 1.7(4.3)\n | 4.0(10)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 7.1\n | 7.9\n | 7.4\n | 5.7\n | 4.5\n | 2.0\n | 4.8\n | 6.0\n | 4.4\n | 4.8\n | 4.4\n | 6.5\n | 65.5\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 0.5\n | 0.5\n | 0.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 0.6\n | 2.0\n |\n| Source: NOAA[22][23] |\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nArchaeologists have divided the long span of Zion's human history into three cultural periods: the Archaic, Protohistoric and Historic periods. Each period is characterized by distinctive technological and social adaptations.\n\n\n\n### Archaic period[edit]\n\n\nThe first human presence in the region dates to 8,000 years ago when family groups camped where they could hunt or collect plants and seeds.[24] About 2,000 years ago, some groups began growing corn and other crops, leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle.[25] Later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos. Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until c. 500.[26] Baskets, cordage nets, and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, drills, and stemmed dart points. The dart points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls.[26]\n\n\nBy c. 300, some of the archaic groups developed into an early branch of seminomadic Anasazi, the Basketmakers.[26] Basketmaker sites have grass- or stone-lined storage cists and shallow, partially underground dwellings called pithouses. They were hunters and gatherers who supplemented their diet with limited agriculture. Locally collected pine nuts were important for food and trade.\n\n\n\n### Protohistoric period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kaun huts were used by Southern Paiute\nBoth the Virgin Anasazi and the Parowan Fremont disappeared from the archaeological record of southwestern Utah by c. 1300.[26] Extended droughts in the 11th and 12th centuries, interspersed with catastrophic flooding, may have made horticulture impossible in this arid region.[26]\n\n\nTradition and archaeological evidence hold that their replacements were Numic-speaking cousins of the Virgin Anasazi, such as the Southern Paiute and Ute.[26] The newcomers migrated on a seasonal basis up and down valleys in search of wild seeds and game animals.[27] Some, particularly the Southern Paiute, also planted fields of corn, sunflowers, and squash to supplement their diet.[27] These more sedentary groups made brownware vessels that were used for storage and cooking.[26]\n\n\n\n### Exploration and settlement[edit]\n\n\nThe Historic period begins in the late 18th century[26] with the exploration of southern Utah by padre Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and padre Francisco Atanasio Domínguez. The padres passed near what is now the Kolob Canyons Visitor Center on October 13, 1776, becoming the first people of European descent known to visit the area.[28] In 1825, trapper and trader Jedediah Smith explored some of the downstream areas while under contract with the American Fur Company.[28]\n\n\nIn 1847, Mormon farmers from the Salt Lake area became the first people of European descent to settle the Virgin River region.[16] In 1851, the Parowan and Cedar City areas were settled by Mormons who used the Kolob Canyons area for timber, and for grazing cattle, sheep, and horses.[29] They prospected for mineral deposits, and diverted Kolob water to irrigate crops in the valley below. Mormon settlers named the area *Kolob* which in Mormon scripture is the heavenly place nearest the residence of God.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)A ranch near the mouth of Zion Canyon (c. 1910s)\nSettlements had expanded 30 miles (48 km) south to the lower Virgin River by 1858.[16] That year, a Southern Paiute guide led young Mormon missionary and interpreter Nephi Johnson into the upper Virgin River area and Zion Canyon.[28] Johnson wrote a favorable report about the agricultural potential of the upper Virgin River basin, and returned later that year to found the town of Virgin. In 1861 or 1862, Joseph Black made the arduous journey to Zion Canyon and was very impressed by its beauty.[5]\n\n\nThe floor of Zion Canyon was settled in 1863 by Isaac Behunin, who farmed corn, tobacco, and fruit trees.[5] The Behunin family lived in Zion Canyon near the site of today's Zion Lodge during the summer, and wintered in Springdale. Behunin is credited with naming Zion, a reference to the place of peace mentioned in the Bible.[5] Two more families settled Zion Canyon in the next couple of years, bringing with them cattle and other domesticated animals. The canyon floor was farmed until Zion became a Monument in 1909.[16]\n\n\nThe Powell Geographic Expedition of 1869 entered the area after their first trip through the Grand Canyon.[16] John Wesley Powell visited Zion Canyon in 1872 and named it *Mukuntuweap*, under the impression that that was the Paiute name.[31] Powell Survey photographers John K. Hillers and James Fennemore first visited the Zion Canyon and Kolob Plateau region in the spring of 1872.[16] Hillers returned in April 1873 to add more photographs to the \"Virgin River Series\" of photographs and stereographs.[32] Hillers described wading the canyon for four days and nearly freezing to death to take his photographs.[32]\n\n\n\n### Protection and tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Painting of Zion Canyon by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh (1903)\nPaintings of the canyon by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh were exhibited at the Saint Louis World's Fair in 1904,[16] followed by a favorable article in *Scribner's Magazine* the next year. The article and paintings, along with previously created photographs, paintings, and reports, led to President William Howard Taft's proclamation on July 31, 1909, that created Mukuntuweap National Monument.[28] In 1917, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service visited the canyon and proposed changing its name from the locally unpopular Mukuntuweap to Zion, a name used by the local Mormon community.[33] The United States Congress added more land and established Zion National Park on November 19, 1919.[5] A separate Zion National Monument, the Kolob Canyons area, was proclaimed on January 22, 1937, and was incorporated into the park on July 11, 1956.[34]\n\n\nTravel to the area before it was a national park was rare due to its remote location, lack of accommodations, and the absence of real roads in southern Utah. Old wagon roads were upgraded to the first automobile roads starting about 1910, and the road into Zion Canyon was built in 1917 leading to the Grotto, short of the present road that now ends at the Temple of Sinawava.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)1938 poster of Zion National Park\nTouring cars could reach Zion Canyon by the summer of 1917.[26] The first visitor lodging in Zion Canyon, called Wylie Camp, was established that same year as a tent camp.[26] The Utah Parks Company, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, acquired Wylie Camp in 1923, and offered ten-day rail/bus tours to Zion, nearby Bryce Canyon, the Kaibab Plateau, and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.[35] The Zion Lodge complex was built in 1925 at the site of the Wylie tent camp.[26] Architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood designed the Zion Lodge in a rustic architectural style, while the Utah Parks Company funded the construction.[26]\n\n\n\n### Infrastructure improvements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Historical buildings and structures of Zion National Park\n\nWork on the Zion Mount Carmel Highway started in 1927 to enable reliable access between Springdale and the east side of the park.[5] The road opened in 1930 and park visit and travel in the area greatly increased.[36] The most famous feature of the Zion – Mount Carmel Highway is its 1.1-mile (1.8 km) tunnel, which has six large windows cut through the massive sandstone cliff.[16]\n\n\nIn 1896, local rancher John Winder improved the Native American footpath up Echo Canyon, which later became the East Rim Trail.[37] Entrepreneur David Flanigan used this trail in 1900 to build cableworks that lowered lumber into Zion Canyon from Cable Mountain. More than 200,000 board feet (470 m3) of lumber were lowered by 1906.[37] The auto road was extended to the Temple of Sinawava, and a trail built from there 1 mile (1.6 km) to the start of the Narrows.[38] Angel's Landing Trail was constructed in 1926 and two suspension bridges were built over the Virgin River.[31] Other trails were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s.[31]\n\n\n\n### More recent history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Altar of Sacrifice (center) with reddish, blood-like streaks\nZion National Park has been featured in numerous films, including *The Deadwood Coach* (1924), *Arizona Bound* (1927), *Nevada* (1927), *Ramrod* (1947) and *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid* (1969).[39]\n\n\nZion Canyon Scenic Drive provides access to Zion Canyon. Traffic congestion in the narrow canyon was recognized as a major problem in the 1990s and a public transportation system using propane-powered shuttle buses was instituted in the year 2000.[40] As part of its shuttle fleet, Zion has two electric trams each holding up to 36 passengers.[41] Usually from early April through late October, the scenic drive in Zion Canyon is closed to private vehicles and visitors ride the shuttle buses.[40] The National Park Service has contracted the management of the shuttle bus system to transit operator RATP Dev.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Zion shuttle bus stops are marked with numbers\nOn April 12, 1995, heavy rains triggered a landslide that blocked the Virgin River in Zion Canyon.[43] Over a period of two hours, the river carved away part of the only exit road from the canyon, trapping 450 guests and employees at the Zion Lodge.[43] A one-lane, temporary road was constructed within 24 hours to allow evacuation of the Lodge.[43] A more stable albeit temporary road was completed on May 25, 1995, to allow summer visitors to access the canyon.[43] This road was replaced with a permanent road during the first half of 1996.[43]\n\n\nThe Zion–Mount Carmel Highway can be travelled year-round. Access for oversized vehicles requires a special permit, and is limited to daytime hours, as traffic through the tunnel must be one way to accommodate large vehicles. The 5-mile (8.0 km)-long Kolob Canyons Road was built to provide access to the Kolob Canyons section of the park.[44] This road often closes in the winter.\n\n\nIn March 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, which designated and further protected 124,406 acres (50,345 ha) of park land, about 85% of the park, as the Zion Wilderness.[45]\n\n\nIn September 2015, flooding trapped a party of seven in Keyhole Canyon, a slot canyon in the park. The flash flood killed all seven members of the group, whose remains were located after a search lasting several days.[46]\n\n\nIn 2017, some scenes from the TV series *Extinct* were shot in the park.[47]\n\n\nOn March 25, 2020, the park campgrounds were closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.[48]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area\n\n![](image)The Three Patriarchs in Zion Canyon are made of Navajo Sandstone\nThe nine known exposed geologic formations in Zion National Park are part of a super-sequence of rock units called the Grand Staircase. Together, these formations represent about 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation in that part of North America. The formations exposed in the Zion area were deposited as sediment in very different environments:\n\n\n\n* The warm, shallow (sometimes advancing or retreating) sea of the Kaibab and Moenkopi formations\n* Streams, ponds, and lakes of the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta formations\n* The vast desert of the Navajo and Temple Cap formations\n* The dry near-shore environment of the Carmel Formation\n\n\n![](image)The Kolob Canyons are a set of finger canyons cut into the Kolob Plateau. Timber Top Mountain to right.\nUplift affected the entire region, known as the Colorado Plateaus, by slowly raising these formations more than 10,000 feet (3,000 m) higher than where they were deposited.[49] This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral Virgin and other rivers on the plateau.\n\n\nThe faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks. Eventually, all Cenozoic-aged formations were removed and gorges were cut into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. During the later part of this process, lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area.[50]\n\n\nHigh water volume in wet seasons does most of the downcutting in the main canyon. These flood events are responsible for transporting most of the 3 million short tons (2.7 million metric tons) of rock and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly.[16] The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin.[16] The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n**Table of formations exposed in Zion National Park**[51]\n| **Rock layer** | **Appearance** | **Location** | **Deposition** | **Rock type** | **Photo** |\n| Dakota Formation | Cliffs | Top of Horse Ranch Mountain | Streams | Conglomerate and sandstone | **![Dakota Sandstone](image)** |\n| Carmel Formation | Cliffs | Mount Carmel Junction | Shallow sea and coastal desert | Limestone, sandstone and gypsum | **![Carmel Formation](image)** |\n| Temple Cap Formation | Cliffs | Top of The West Temple | Desert | Sandstone | **![Temple Cap Formation atop Navajo Sandstone](image)** |\n| Navajo Sandstone | Steep cliffs 1,600 to 2,200 ft (490 to 670 m) thick; red lower layers are colored by iron oxides | Tall cliffs of Zion Canyon; highest exposure is West Temple; cross-bedding shows well at Checkerboard Mesa (photo) | Sand dunes covered 150,000 sq mi (390,000 km2); shifting winds during deposition created cross-bedding | Sandstone | **![Navajo Sandstone](image)** |\n| Kayenta Formation | Rocky slopes | Throughout canyon | Streams | Siltstone and sandstone | **![Kayenta Formation](image)** |\n| Moenave Formation | Slopes and ledges | Lower red cliffs seen from Zion Human History Museum | Streams and ponds | Siltstone and sandstone | **![Moenave Formation](image)** |\n| Chinle Formation | Purplish slopes | Above Rockville | Streams | Shale, loose clay and conglomerate | **![Chinle Formation](image)** |\n| Moenkopi Formation | Chocolate cliffs with white bands | Rocky slopes from Virgin to Rockville | Shallow sea | Shale, siltstone, sandstone, mudstone, and limestone | **![Moenkopi Formation](image)** |\n| Kaibab Limestone | Cliffs | Hurricane Cliffs along I-15 near Kolob Canyons | Shallow sea | Limestone | **![Hurricane Cliffs/Kaibab Limestone](image)** |\n\n\n## Biology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Taylor Creek with Horse Ranch Mountain in background. Desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest habitats are all visible.\nThe Great Basin, Mojave Desert, and Colorado Plateau converge at Zion and the Kolob canyons.[52] This, along with the varied topography of canyon–mesa country, differing soil types, and uneven water availability, provides diverse habitat for the equally diverse mix of plants and animals that live in the area. The park is home to 289 bird, 79 mammals, 28 reptiles, 7 fish, and 6 amphibian species.[53] These organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the park: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest.[54]\n\n\nDesert conditions persist on canyon bottoms and rocky ledges away from perennial streams. Sagebrush, prickly pear cactus, and rabbitbrush, along with sacred datura and Indian paintbrush, are common.[55] Utah penstemon and golden aster can also be found.[56] Milkvetch and prince's plume are found in pockets of selenium-rich soils.[54]\n\n\nCommon daytime animals include mule deer, rock squirrels, pinyon jays, and whiptail and collared lizards. Desert cottontails,[57] jackrabbits, and Merriam's kangaroo rats come out at night. Cougars, bobcats, coyotes, badgers, gray foxes, and ring-tail cats are the top predators.[57]\n\n\nCooler conditions persist at mid-elevation slopes, from 3,900 to 5,500 feet (1,200 to 1,700 m).[54] Stunted forests of pinyon pine and juniper coexist here with manzanita shrubs, cliffrose, serviceberry, scrub oak, and yucca.[54] Stands of ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, manzanita and aspen populate the mesas and cliffs above 6,000 feet (1,800 m).[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)Desert bighorn sheep are often visible near the roadway in the park.\nGolden eagles, red-tailed hawks, peregrine falcons, and white-throated swifts can be seen in the area.[58] Desert bighorn sheep were reintroduced in the park in 1973.[59] California condors were reintroduced in the Arizona Strip and in 2014 the first successful breeding of condors in the park was confirmed.[60][61] Nineteen species of bat also live in the area.[62]\n\n\nBoxelder, Fremont cottonwood, maple, and willow dominate riparian plant communities.[54] Animals such as bank beavers, flannel-mouth suckers, gnatcatchers, dippers, canyon wrens, the virgin spinedace, and water striders all make their homes in the riparian zones.[63]\n\n\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\nRangers at the visitor centers in Zion Canyon and Kolob Canyons can help visitors plan their stay. Guided horseback riding trips, nature walks, and evening programs are available from late March to early November.[64] The Junior Ranger Program for children ages 4 and up is active year-round at the Nature Center, Human History Museum, and the visitor centers.[65] A bookstore attached to the Zion Canyon visitor center offers books, maps, and souvenirs.[66] The Grotto in Zion Canyon, the visitor center, and the viewpoint at the end of Kolob Canyons Road have the only designated picnic sites.[14]\n\n\n\nTrails\n![](image)The Subway, a slot canyon within the Kolob Terrace section\nSeven trails with round-trip times of half an hour (Weeping Rock) to 4 hours (Angels Landing) are found in Zion Canyon.[67] Two popular trails, Taylor Creek (4 hours round trip) and Kolob Arch (8 hours round trip), are in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, near Cedar City.[67] Hiking up into The Narrows from the Temple of Sinawava is popular in summer, but hiking beyond Big Springs requires a permit. The entire Narrows from Chamberlain's Ranch is a 16-mile one way trip that typically takes 12 hours of strenuous hiking.[68] A shorter alternative is to enter the Narrows via Orderville Canyon. Both Orderville and the full Narrows require a back country permit. Entrance to the Parunuweap Canyon section of the park downstream of Labyrinth Falls is prohibited. Other often-used backcountry trails include the West Rim and LaVerkin Creek.[69] The more primitive sections of Zion include the Kolob Terrace and the Kolob Canyons.[14] A network of trails totaling 50 miles in distance connect Zion's northwest corner of the park (Lee Pass Trailhead) to its southeast section (East Rim Trailhead). Popularly known as the Zion Traverse, the route offers backpackers a diverse experience of the park.\n\n\nZion is a center for rock climbing, with short walls like Spaceshot, Moonlight Buttress, Prodigal Son, Ashtar Command, and Touchstone being the most popular, highly rated routes.[70][71]\n\n\n\nCamping and lodging\n![](image)Zion Lodge accommodations\nLodging in the park is available at Zion Lodge, located halfway through Zion Canyon. Just outside the park more lodging is available in Springdale.[72]\n\n\nZion has three campgrounds: South and Watchman at the far southern side of the park, and a primitive site at Lava Point in the middle of the park off Kolob Terrace Road.[73] Overnight camping in the backcountry requires permits.[74]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of national parks of the United States\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Zion National Park\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Iron County, Kane County and Washington County, Utah\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Listing of acreage – December 31, 2012\" (XLSX).

Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River.\n\n\nHuman habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Ancestral Puebloans (who used to be called Anasazi by early non-indigenous archeologists[4])(c. 300 CE). Subsequently, what has been called the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities.[5] Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. \n\n\n\n\n## Name change[edit]\n\n\nIn 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area **Mukuntuweap National Monument** in order to protect the canyon.[6] In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to **Zion National Monument**, Zion being a term used by the Mormons.[6] According to historian Hal Rothman: \"The name change played to a prevalent bias of the time. Many believed that Spanish and Indian names would deter visitors who, if they could not pronounce the name of a place, might not bother to visit it.[7] The new name, Zion, had greater appeal to an ethnocentric audience.\"[8] On November 19, 1919, Congress redesignated the monument as **Zion National Park**, and the act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson.[9] The Kolob section was proclaimed a separate Zion National Monument in 1937, but was incorporated into the national park in 1956.[10] Congress designated 85% of the park a wilderness area in 2009.\n\n\nThe geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area includes nine formations that together represent 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation. At various periods in that time warm, shallow seas, streams, ponds and lakes, vast deserts, and dry near-shore environments covered the area. Uplift associated with the creation of the Colorado Plateau lifted the region 10,000 feet (3,000 m) starting 13 million years ago.[11]\n\n\n\n## Park purpose[edit]\n\n\nAs stated in the foundation document:[12]\n\n\n\n\n> The purpose of Zion National Park is to preserve the dramatic geology including Zion Canyon and a labyrinth of deep and brilliantly colored Navajo sandstone canyons formed by extraordinary processes of erosion at the margin of the Colorado Plateau; to safeguard the park's wilderness character and its wild and scenic river values; to protect evidence of human history; and to provide for scientific research and the enjoyment and enlightenment of the public.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nThe park is located in southwestern Utah in Washington, Iron and Kane counties. Geomorphically, it is located on the Markagunt and Kolob plateaus, at the intersection of three North American geographic provinces: the Colorado Plateau, the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert. The northern part of the park is known as the **Kolob Canyons** section and is accessible from Interstate 15, exit 40.[13]\n\n\nThe 8,726-foot (2,660 m) summit of Horse Ranch Mountain is the highest point in the park; the lowest point is the 3,666-foot (1,117 m) elevation of Coal Pits Wash, creating a relief of about 5,100 feet (1,600 m).[14]\n\n\nStreams in the area take rectangular paths because they follow jointing planes in the rocks.[15] The stream gradient of the Virgin River, whose North Fork flows through Zion Canyon in the park, ranges from 50 to 80 feet per mile (9.5 to 15.2 m/km) (0.9–1.5%)—one of the steepest stream gradients in North America.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Towers of the Virgin: The Sundial (left), The Witch Head, Broken Tooth, Rotten Tooth, Altar of Sacrifice\nThe road into Zion Canyon is 6 miles (9.7 km) long, ending at the Temple of Sinawava, which is named for the coyote god of the Paiute Indians.[17] The canyon becomes more narrow near the Temple and a hiking trail continues to the mouth of The Narrows, a gorge only 20 feet (6 m) wide and up to 2,000 feet (610 m) tall.[18] The Zion Canyon road is served by a free shuttle bus from early April to late October and by private vehicles the other months of the year. Other roads in Zion are open to private vehicles year-round.\n\n\nThe east side of the park is served by Zion-Mount Carmel Highway (SR-9), which passes through the Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel and ends at US 89 at Mount Carmel Junction. Park features on the east side of the park include Checkerboard Mesa and The East Temple.\n\n\nThe Kolob Terrace area, northwest of Zion Canyon, features a slot canyon called The Subway, and a panoramic view of the entire area from Lava Point. The Kolob Canyons section, further to the northwest near Cedar City, features Tucupit Point and one of the world's longest natural arches, Kolob Arch.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Court of the Patriarchs, by Ansel Adams (1933)\nOther notable geographic features of Zion Canyon include Angels Landing, The Great White Throne, the Court of the Patriarchs, The Sentinel, The West Temple, Towers of the Virgin, the Altar of Sacrifice, The Watchman, Weeping Rock, and the Emerald Pools.[20]\n\n\nSpring weather is unpredictable, with stormy, wet days being common, mixed with occasional warm, sunny weather. Precipitation is normally heaviest in March.[21] Spring wildflowers bloom from April through June, peaking in May. Fall days are usually clear and mild; nights are often cool. Summer days are hot (95 to 110 °F; 35 to 43 °C), but overnight lows are usually comfortable (65 to 70 °F; 18 to 21 °C).[21] Afternoon thunderstorms are common from mid-July through mid-September.[21] Storms may produce waterfalls as well as flash floods. Autumn tree-color displays begin in September in the high country; in Zion Canyon, autumn colors usually peak in late October. Winter in Zion Canyon is fairly mild. Winter storms bring rain or light snow to Zion Canyon and heavier snow to the higher elevations. Clear days may become quite warm, reaching 60 °F (16 °C); nights are often 20 to 40 °F (−7 to 4 °C).[21] Winter storms can last several days and make roads icy. Zion roads are plowed, except the Kolob Terrace Road which is closed when covered with snow.[21] Winter driving conditions last from November through March.[21]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nZion National Park has a *BSk* (Köppen climate classification) cold semi-arid climate consisting of very hot summers and mild winters with a limited amount of precipitation throughout the year.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Zion National Park, Utah, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1904–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 74(23)\n | 97(36)\n | 91(33)\n | 97(36)\n | 106(41)\n | 114(46)\n | 115(46)\n | 112(44)\n | 110(43)\n | 99(37)\n | 90(32)\n | 81(27)\n | 115(46)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 66.3(19.1)\n | 70.3(21.3)\n | 79.8(26.6)\n | 87.8(31.0)\n | 97.0(36.1)\n | 105.6(40.9)\n | 109.4(43.0)\n | 106.5(41.4)\n | 101.5(38.6)\n | 91.6(33.1)\n | 78.7(25.9)\n | 65.6(18.7)\n | 110.1(43.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 57.6(14.2)\n | 66.1(18.9)\n | 73.1(22.8)\n | 83.5(28.6)\n | 95.3(35.2)\n | 100.3(37.9)\n | 98.0(36.7)\n | 90.7(32.6)\n | 78.1(25.6)\n | 63.9(17.7)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 76.1(24.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 42.1(5.6)\n | 45.6(7.6)\n | 52.4(11.3)\n | 58.4(14.7)\n | 68.0(20.0)\n | 78.8(26.0)\n | 84.9(29.4)\n | 83.3(28.5)\n | 76.0(24.4)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 40.9(4.9)\n | 62.0(16.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 30.4(−0.9)\n | 33.6(0.9)\n | 38.7(3.7)\n | 43.8(6.6)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 62.2(16.8)\n | 69.5(20.8)\n | 68.7(20.4)\n | 61.3(16.3)\n | 48.8(9.3)\n | 37.3(2.9)\n | 29.3(−1.5)\n | 48.0(8.9)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 14.9(−9.5)\n | 18.9(−7.3)\n | 24.9(−3.9)\n | 29.1(−1.6)\n | 37.1(2.8)\n | 46.6(8.1)\n | 59.8(15.4)\n | 59.7(15.4)\n | 47.8(8.8)\n | 31.4(−0.3)\n | 19.7(−6.8)\n | 13.5(−10.3)\n | 10.7(−11.8)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −15(−26)\n | 0(−18)\n | 10(−12)\n | 21(−6)\n | 22(−6)\n | 35(2)\n | 41(5)\n | 37(3)\n | 33(1)\n | 13(−11)\n | 0(−18)\n | −5(−21)\n | −15(−26)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 1.99(51)\n | 2.06(52)\n | 2.01(51)\n | 1.22(31)\n | 0.77(20)\n | 0.23(5.8)\n | 1.15(29)\n | 1.63(41)\n | 1.17(30)\n | 1.22(31)\n | 1.18(30)\n | 1.64(42)\n | 16.27(413)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 0.7(1.8)\n | 0.8(2.0)\n | 0.7(1.8)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 1.7(4.3)\n | 4.0(10)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 7.1\n | 7.9\n | 7.4\n | 5.7\n | 4.5\n | 2.0\n | 4.8\n | 6.0\n | 4.4\n | 4.8\n | 4.4\n | 6.5\n | 65.5\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 0.5\n | 0.5\n | 0.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 0.6\n | 2.0\n |\n| Source: NOAA[22][23] |\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nArchaeologists have divided the long span of Zion's human history into three cultural periods: the Archaic, Protohistoric and Historic periods. Each period is characterized by distinctive technological and social adaptations.\n\n\n\n### Archaic period[edit]\n\n\nThe first human presence in the region dates to 8,000 years ago when family groups camped where they could hunt or collect plants and seeds.[24] About 2,000 years ago, some groups began growing corn and other crops, leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle.[25] Later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos. Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until c. 500.[26] Baskets, cordage nets, and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, drills, and stemmed dart points. The dart points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls.[26]\n\n\nBy c. 300, some of the archaic groups developed into an early branch of seminomadic Anasazi, the Basketmakers.[26] Basketmaker sites have grass- or stone-lined storage cists and shallow, partially underground dwellings called pithouses. They were hunters and gatherers who supplemented their diet with limited agriculture. Locally collected pine nuts were important for food and trade.\n\n\n\n### Protohistoric period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kaun huts were used by Southern Paiute\nBoth the Virgin Anasazi and the Parowan Fremont disappeared from the archaeological record of southwestern Utah by c. 1300.[26] Extended droughts in the 11th and 12th centuries, interspersed with catastrophic flooding, may have made horticulture impossible in this arid region.[26]\n\n\nTradition and archaeological evidence hold that their replacements were Numic-speaking cousins of the Virgin Anasazi, such as the Southern Paiute and Ute.[26] The newcomers migrated on a seasonal basis up and down valleys in search of wild seeds and game animals.[27] Some, particularly the Southern Paiute, also planted fields of corn, sunflowers, and squash to supplement their diet.[27] These more sedentary groups made brownware vessels that were used for storage and cooking.[26]\n\n\n\n### Exploration and settlement[edit]\n\n\nThe Historic period begins in the late 18th century[26] with the exploration of southern Utah by padre Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and padre Francisco Atanasio Domínguez. The padres passed near what is now the Kolob Canyons Visitor Center on October 13, 1776, becoming the first people of European descent known to visit the area.[28] In 1825, trapper and trader Jedediah Smith explored some of the downstream areas while under contract with the American Fur Company.[28]\n\n\nIn 1847, Mormon farmers from the Salt Lake area became the first people of European descent to settle the Virgin River region.[16] In 1851, the Parowan and Cedar City areas were settled by Mormons who used the Kolob Canyons area for timber, and for grazing cattle, sheep, and horses.[29] They prospected for mineral deposits, and diverted Kolob water to irrigate crops in the valley below. Mormon settlers named the area *Kolob* which in Mormon scripture is the heavenly place nearest the residence of God.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)A ranch near the mouth of Zion Canyon (c. 1910s)\nSettlements had expanded 30 miles (48 km) south to the lower Virgin River by 1858.[16] That year, a Southern Paiute guide led young Mormon missionary and interpreter Nephi Johnson into the upper Virgin River area and Zion Canyon.[28] Johnson wrote a favorable report about the agricultural potential of the upper Virgin River basin, and returned later that year to found the town of Virgin. In 1861 or 1862, Joseph Black made the arduous journey to Zion Canyon and was very impressed by its beauty.[5]\n\n\nThe floor of Zion Canyon was settled in 1863 by Isaac Behunin, who farmed corn, tobacco, and fruit trees.[5] The Behunin family lived in Zion Canyon near the site of today's Zion Lodge during the summer, and wintered in Springdale. Behunin is credited with naming Zion, a reference to the place of peace mentioned in the Bible.[5] Two more families settled Zion Canyon in the next couple of years, bringing with them cattle and other domesticated animals. The canyon floor was farmed until Zion became a Monument in 1909.[16]\n\n\nThe Powell Geographic Expedition of 1869 entered the area after their first trip through the Grand Canyon.[16] John Wesley Powell visited Zion Canyon in 1872 and named it *Mukuntuweap*, under the impression that that was the Paiute name.[31] Powell Survey photographers John K. Hillers and James Fennemore first visited the Zion Canyon and Kolob Plateau region in the spring of 1872.[16] Hillers returned in April 1873 to add more photographs to the \"Virgin River Series\" of photographs and stereographs.[32] Hillers described wading the canyon for four days and nearly freezing to death to take his photographs.[32]\n\n\n\n### Protection and tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Painting of Zion Canyon by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh (1903)\nPaintings of the canyon by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh were exhibited at the Saint Louis World's Fair in 1904,[16] followed by a favorable article in *Scribner's Magazine* the next year. The article and paintings, along with previously created photographs, paintings, and reports, led to President William Howard Taft's proclamation on July 31, 1909, that created Mukuntuweap National Monument.[28] In 1917, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service visited the canyon and proposed changing its name from the locally unpopular Mukuntuweap to Zion, a name used by the local Mormon community.[33] The United States Congress added more land and established Zion National Park on November 19, 1919.[5] A separate Zion National Monument, the Kolob Canyons area, was proclaimed on January 22, 1937, and was incorporated into the park on July 11, 1956.[34]\n\n\nTravel to the area before it was a national park was rare due to its remote location, lack of accommodations, and the absence of real roads in southern Utah. Old wagon roads were upgraded to the first automobile roads starting about 1910, and the road into Zion Canyon was built in 1917 leading to the Grotto, short of the present road that now ends at the Temple of Sinawava.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)1938 poster of Zion National Park\nTouring cars could reach Zion Canyon by the summer of 1917.[26] The first visitor lodging in Zion Canyon, called Wylie Camp, was established that same year as a tent camp.[26] The Utah Parks Company, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, acquired Wylie Camp in 1923, and offered ten-day rail/bus tours to Zion, nearby Bryce Canyon, the Kaibab Plateau, and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.[35] The Zion Lodge complex was built in 1925 at the site of the Wylie tent camp.[26] Architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood designed the Zion Lodge in a rustic architectural style, while the Utah Parks Company funded the construction.[26]\n\n\n\n### Infrastructure improvements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Historical buildings and structures of Zion National Park\n\nWork on the Zion Mount Carmel Highway started in 1927 to enable reliable access between Springdale and the east side of the park.[5] The road opened in 1930 and park visit and travel in the area greatly increased.[36] The most famous feature of the Zion – Mount Carmel Highway is its 1.1-mile (1.8 km) tunnel, which has six large windows cut through the massive sandstone cliff.[16]\n\n\nIn 1896, local rancher John Winder improved the Native American footpath up Echo Canyon, which later became the East Rim Trail.[37] Entrepreneur David Flanigan used this trail in 1900 to build cableworks that lowered lumber into Zion Canyon from Cable Mountain. More than 200,000 board feet (470 m3) of lumber were lowered by 1906.[37] The auto road was extended to the Temple of Sinawava, and a trail built from there 1 mile (1.6 km) to the start of the Narrows.[38] Angel's Landing Trail was constructed in 1926 and two suspension bridges were built over the Virgin River.[31] Other trails were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s.[31]\n\n\n\n### More recent history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Altar of Sacrifice (center) with reddish, blood-like streaks\nZion National Park has been featured in numerous films, including *The Deadwood Coach* (1924), *Arizona Bound* (1927), *Nevada* (1927), *Ramrod* (1947) and *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid* (1969).[39]\n\n\nZion Canyon Scenic Drive provides access to Zion Canyon. Traffic congestion in the narrow canyon was recognized as a major problem in the 1990s and a public transportation system using propane-powered shuttle buses was instituted in the year 2000.[40] As part of its shuttle fleet, Zion has two electric trams each holding up to 36 passengers.[41] Usually from early April through late October, the scenic drive in Zion Canyon is closed to private vehicles and visitors ride the shuttle buses.[40] The National Park Service has contracted the management of the shuttle bus system to transit operator RATP Dev.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Zion shuttle bus stops are marked with numbers\nOn April 12, 1995, heavy rains triggered a landslide that blocked the Virgin River in Zion Canyon.[43] Over a period of two hours, the river carved away part of the only exit road from the canyon, trapping 450 guests and employees at the Zion Lodge.[43] A one-lane, temporary road was constructed within 24 hours to allow evacuation of the Lodge.[43] A more stable albeit temporary road was completed on May 25, 1995, to allow summer visitors to access the canyon.[43] This road was replaced with a permanent road during the first half of 1996.[43]\n\n\nThe Zion–Mount Carmel Highway can be travelled year-round. Access for oversized vehicles requires a special permit, and is limited to daytime hours, as traffic through the tunnel must be one way to accommodate large vehicles. The 5-mile (8.0 km)-long Kolob Canyons Road was built to provide access to the Kolob Canyons section of the park.[44] This road often closes in the winter.\n\n\nIn March 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, which designated and further protected 124,406 acres (50,345 ha) of park land, about 85% of the park, as the Zion Wilderness.[45]\n\n\nIn September 2015, flooding trapped a party of seven in Keyhole Canyon, a slot canyon in the park. The flash flood killed all seven members of the group, whose remains were located after a search lasting several days.[46]\n\n\nIn 2017, some scenes from the TV series *Extinct* were shot in the park.[47]\n\n\nOn March 25, 2020, the park campgrounds were closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.[48]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area\n\n![](image)The Three Patriarchs in Zion Canyon are made of Navajo Sandstone\nThe nine known exposed geologic formations in Zion National Park are part of a super-sequence of rock units called the Grand Staircase. Together, these formations represent about 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation in that part of North America. The formations exposed in the Zion area were deposited as sediment in very different environments:\n\n\n\n* The warm, shallow (sometimes advancing or retreating) sea of the Kaibab and Moenkopi formations\n* Streams, ponds, and lakes of the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta formations\n* The vast desert of the Navajo and Temple Cap formations\n* The dry near-shore environment of the Carmel Formation\n\n\n![](image)The Kolob Canyons are a set of finger canyons cut into the Kolob Plateau. Timber Top Mountain to right.\nUplift affected the entire region, known as the Colorado Plateaus, by slowly raising these formations more than 10,000 feet (3,000 m) higher than where they were deposited.[49] This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral Virgin and other rivers on the plateau.\n\n\nThe faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks. Eventually, all Cenozoic-aged formations were removed and gorges were cut into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. During the later part of this process, lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area.[50]\n\n\nHigh water volume in wet seasons does most of the downcutting in the main canyon. These flood events are responsible for transporting most of the 3 million short tons (2.7 million metric tons) of rock and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly.[16] The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin.[16] The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n**Table of formations exposed in Zion National Park**[51]\n| **Rock layer** | **Appearance** | **Location** | **Deposition** | **Rock type** | **Photo** |\n| Dakota Formation | Cliffs | Top of Horse Ranch Mountain | Streams | Conglomerate and sandstone | **![Dakota Sandstone](image)** |\n| Carmel Formation | Cliffs | Mount Carmel Junction | Shallow sea and coastal desert | Limestone, sandstone and gypsum | **![Carmel Formation](image)** |\n| Temple Cap Formation | Cliffs | Top of The West Temple | Desert | Sandstone | **![Temple Cap Formation atop Navajo Sandstone](image)** |\n| Navajo Sandstone | Steep cliffs 1,600 to 2,200 ft (490 to 670 m) thick; red lower layers are colored by iron oxides | Tall cliffs of Zion Canyon; highest exposure is West Temple; cross-bedding shows well at Checkerboard Mesa (photo) | Sand dunes covered 150,000 sq mi (390,000 km2); shifting winds during deposition created cross-bedding | Sandstone | **![Navajo Sandstone](image)** |\n| Kayenta Formation | Rocky slopes | Throughout canyon | Streams | Siltstone and sandstone | **![Kayenta Formation](image)** |\n| Moenave Formation | Slopes and ledges | Lower red cliffs seen from Zion Human History Museum | Streams and ponds | Siltstone and sandstone | **![Moenave Formation](image)** |\n| Chinle Formation | Purplish slopes | Above Rockville | Streams | Shale, loose clay and conglomerate | **![Chinle Formation](image)** |\n| Moenkopi Formation | Chocolate cliffs with white bands | Rocky slopes from Virgin to Rockville | Shallow sea | Shale, siltstone, sandstone, mudstone, and limestone | **![Moenkopi Formation](image)** |\n| Kaibab Limestone | Cliffs | Hurricane Cliffs along I-15 near Kolob Canyons | Shallow sea | Limestone | **![Hurricane Cliffs/Kaibab Limestone](image)** |\n\n\n## Biology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Taylor Creek with Horse Ranch Mountain in background. Desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest habitats are all visible.\nThe Great Basin, Mojave Desert, and Colorado Plateau converge at Zion and the Kolob canyons.[52] This, along with the varied topography of canyon–mesa country, differing soil types, and uneven water availability, provides diverse habitat for the equally diverse mix of plants and animals that live in the area. The park is home to 289 bird, 79 mammals, 28 reptiles, 7 fish, and 6 amphibian species.[53] These organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the park: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest.[54]\n\n\nDesert conditions persist on canyon bottoms and rocky ledges away from perennial streams. Sagebrush, prickly pear cactus, and rabbitbrush, along with sacred datura and Indian paintbrush, are common.[55] Utah penstemon and golden aster can also be found.[56] Milkvetch and prince's plume are found in pockets of selenium-rich soils.[54]\n\n\nCommon daytime animals include mule deer, rock squirrels, pinyon jays, and whiptail and collared lizards. Desert cottontails,[57] jackrabbits, and Merriam's kangaroo rats come out at night. Cougars, bobcats, coyotes, badgers, gray foxes, and ring-tail cats are the top predators.[57]\n\n\nCooler conditions persist at mid-elevation slopes, from 3,900 to 5,500 feet (1,200 to 1,700 m).[54] Stunted forests of pinyon pine and juniper coexist here with manzanita shrubs, cliffrose, serviceberry, scrub oak, and yucca.[54] Stands of ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, manzanita and aspen populate the mesas and cliffs above 6,000 feet (1,800 m).[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)Desert bighorn sheep are often visible near the roadway in the park.\nGolden eagles, red-tailed hawks, peregrine falcons, and white-throated swifts can be seen in the area.[58] Desert bighorn sheep were reintroduced in the park in 1973.[59] California condors were reintroduced in the Arizona Strip and in 2014 the first successful breeding of condors in the park was confirmed.[60][61] Nineteen species of bat also live in the area.[62]\n\n\nBoxelder, Fremont cottonwood, maple, and willow dominate riparian plant communities.[54] Animals such as bank beavers, flannel-mouth suckers, gnatcatchers, dippers, canyon wrens, the virgin spinedace, and water striders all make their homes in the riparian zones.[63]\n\n\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\nRangers at the visitor centers in Zion Canyon and Kolob Canyons can help visitors plan their stay. Guided horseback riding trips, nature walks, and evening programs are available from late March to early November.[64] The Junior Ranger Program for children ages 4 and up is active year-round at the Nature Center, Human History Museum, and the visitor centers.[65] A bookstore attached to the Zion Canyon visitor center offers books, maps, and souvenirs.[66] The Grotto in Zion Canyon, the visitor center, and the viewpoint at the end of Kolob Canyons Road have the only designated picnic sites.[14]\n\n\n\nTrails\n![](image)The Subway, a slot canyon within the Kolob Terrace section\nSeven trails with round-trip times of half an hour (Weeping Rock) to 4 hours (Angels Landing) are found in Zion Canyon.[67] Two popular trails, Taylor Creek (4 hours round trip) and Kolob Arch (8 hours round trip), are in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, near Cedar City.[67] Hiking up into The Narrows from the Temple of Sinawava is popular in summer, but hiking beyond Big Springs requires a permit. The entire Narrows from Chamberlain's Ranch is a 16-mile one way trip that typically takes 12 hours of strenuous hiking.[68] A shorter alternative is to enter the Narrows via Orderville Canyon. Both Orderville and the full Narrows require a back country permit. Entrance to the Parunuweap Canyon section of the park downstream of Labyrinth Falls is prohibited. Other often-used backcountry trails include the West Rim and LaVerkin Creek.[69] The more primitive sections of Zion include the Kolob Terrace and the Kolob Canyons.[14] A network of trails totaling 50 miles in distance connect Zion's northwest corner of the park (Lee Pass Trailhead) to its southeast section (East Rim Trailhead). Popularly known as the Zion Traverse, the route offers backpackers a diverse experience of the park.\n\n\nZion is a center for rock climbing, with short walls like Spaceshot, Moonlight Buttress, Prodigal Son, Ashtar Command, and Touchstone being the most popular, highly rated routes.[70][71]\n\n\n\nCamping and lodging\n![](image)Zion Lodge accommodations\nLodging in the park is available at Zion Lodge, located halfway through Zion Canyon. Just outside the park more lodging is available in Springdale.[72]\n\n\nZion has three campgrounds: South and Watchman at the far southern side of the park, and a primitive site at Lava Point in the middle of the park off Kolob Terrace Road.[73] Overnight camping in the backcountry requires permits.[74]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of national parks of the United States\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Zion National Park\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Iron County, Kane County and Washington County, Utah\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Listing of acreage – December 31, 2012\" (XLSX).

The park is situated between the towns of Estes Park to the east and Grand Lake to the west. The eastern and western slopes of the Continental Divide run directly through the center of the park with the headwaters of the Colorado River located in the park's northwestern region.[6] The main features of the park include mountains, alpine lakes and a wide variety of wildlife within various climates and environments, from wooded forests to mountain tundra.\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountain National Park Act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson on January 26, 1915, establishing the park boundaries and protecting the area for future generations.[3] The Civilian Conservation Corps built the main automobile route, Trail Ridge Road, in the 1930s.[3] In 1976, UNESCO designated the park as one of the first World Biosphere Reserves.[7] In 2018, more than 4.5 million recreational visitors entered the park.[8] The park is one of the most visited in the National Park System, ranking as the third most visited national park in 2015.[9] In 2019, the park saw record attendance yet again with 4,678,804 visitors, a 44% increase since 2012.[10]\n\n\nThe park has a total of five visitor centers,[11] with park headquarters located at the Beaver Meadows Visitor Center—a National Historic Landmark designed by the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture at Taliesin West.[12] National Forest lands surround the park on all sides, including Roosevelt National Forest to the north and east, Routt National Forest to the north and west, and Arapaho National Forest to the west and south, with the Indian Peaks Wilderness area located directly south of the park.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Location of the Rocky Mountains\nMain article: History of Rocky Mountain National Park\n\nThe history of Rocky Mountain National Park began when Paleo-Indians traveled along what is now Trail Ridge Road to hunt and forage for food.[13] Ute and Arapaho people subsequently hunted and camped in the area.[14][15] In 1820, the Long Expedition, led by Stephen H. Long for whom Longs Peak was named, approached the Rockies via the Platte River.[16][17] Settlers began arriving in the mid-1800s,[18] displacing the Native Americans who mostly left the area voluntarily by 1860,[19] while others were removed to reservations by 1878.[15]\n\n\nLulu City, Dutchtown, and Gaskill in the Never Summer Mountains were established in the 1870s when prospectors came in search of gold and silver.[20] The boom ended by 1883 with miners deserting their claims.[21] The railroad reached Lyons, Colorado in 1881 and the Big Thompson Canyon Road—a section of U.S. Route 34 from Loveland to Estes Park—was completed in 1904.[22] The 1920s saw a boom in building lodges, including the Bear Lake Trail School, and roads in the park, culminating with the construction of Trail Ridge Road to Fall River Pass between 1929 and 1932, then to Grand Lake by 1938.[23]\n\n\nProminent individuals in the effort to create a national park included Enos Mills from the Estes Park area, James Grafton Rogers from Denver, and J. Horace McFarland of Pennsylvania.[24] The national park was established on January 26, 1915.[3]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of peaks in Rocky Mountain National Park\n\n![](image)View from Forest Canyon Overlook along Trail Ridge Road\nRocky Mountain National Park encompasses 265,461 acres (414.78 sq mi; 1,074.28 km2) of federal land,[2] with an additional 253,059 acres (395.40 sq mi; 1,024.09 km2) of U.S. Forest Service wilderness adjoining the park boundaries.[25] The Continental Divide runs generally north–south through the center of the park,[26] with rivers and streams on the western side of the divide flowing toward the Pacific Ocean while those on the eastern side flow toward the Atlantic.[27]\n\n\nA geographical anomaly is found along the slopes of the Never Summer Mountains where the Continental Divide forms a horseshoe–shaped bend for about 6 miles (9.7 km), heading from south–to–north but then curving sharply southward and westward out of the park.[6][28] The sharp bend results in streams on the eastern slopes of the range joining the headwaters of the Colorado River that flow south and west, eventually reaching the Pacific.[6][29] Meanwhile, streams on the western slopes join rivers that flow north and then east and south, eventually reaching the Atlantic.[6][29]\n\n\n\n![](image)View from *Many Parks Curve* on Trail Ridge Road. The \"parks\" in the Rockies are meadows that formed when glacial lakes drained.\nThe headwaters of the Colorado River are located in the park's northwestern region.[26] The park contains approximately 450 miles (724 km) of rivers and streams, 350 miles (563 km) of trails, and 150 lakes.[26][30]\n\n\nRocky Mountain National Park is one of the highest national parks in the nation, with elevations from 7,860 to 14,259 feet (2,396 to 4,346 m),[31] the highest point of which is Longs Peak.[32] Trail Ridge Road is the highest paved through-road in the country, with a peak elevation of 12,183 feet (3,713 m).[33] Sixty mountain peaks over 12,000 feet (3,658 m) high provide scenic vistas.[31] On the north side of the park, the Mummy Range contains a number of thirteener peaks, including Hagues Peak, Mummy Mountain, Fairchild Mountain, Ypsilon Mountain, and Mount Chiquita.[34] Several small glaciers and permanent snowfields are found in the high mountain cirques.[35]\n\n\nThere are five regions, or geographical zones, within the park.\n\n\n\n### Region 1: Moose and big meadows[edit]\n\n\nRegion 1 is known for moose and big meadows and is located on the west, or Grand Lake, side of the Continental Divide.[36] Thirty miles of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail loop through the park and pass through alpine tundra and scenery.[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bull elk in a meadow near the headwaters of the Colorado River\nThe Big Meadows area with its grasses and wildflowers can be reached via the Onahu, Tonahutu, or Green Mountain trail. Other scenic areas include Long Meadows and the Kawuneeche Valley (Coyote Valley) of the upper Colorado River which is a good place for birdwatching, as well as snowshoeing and cross-country skiing in winter. The valley trail loops through Kawuneeche Valley[37] which contained as many as 39 mines, though less than 20 of those have archived records and archeological remains.[38] LuLu City is the site of an abandoned silver mining town of the early 1880s located along the Colorado River Trail.[6] According to a 1985 report prepared for the NRHP, there were only three cabin ruins remaining along with remnants of six other buildings.[39]\n\n\nBaker Pass crosses the Continental Divide through the Never Summer Mountains and into the Michigan River drainage to the west of Mount Nimbus[37]—a drainage that feeds streams and rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico.[29] Other mountain passes are La Poudre Pass and Thunder Pass, which was once used by stage coaches and is a route to Michigan Lakes. Little Yellowstone has geological features similar to the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The Green Mountain trail once was a wagon road used to haul hay from Big Meadows. Flattop Mountain, which can be accessed from the eastern and western sides of the park, is near Green Mountain. Shadow Mountain Lookout—a wildfire observation tower—is on the National Register of Historic Places.[37] Paradise Park Natural Area is an essentially hidden and protected wild area with no maintained trails penetrating it.[40]\n\n\nSkeleton Gulch, Cascade Falls, North Inlet Falls, Granite Falls, and Adams Falls are found in the west side of the park. The west side lakes include Bowen Lake, Lake Verna, Lake of the Clouds, Haynach Lakes, Timber Lake, Lone Pine Lake, Lake Nanita, and Lake Nokoni.[37]\n\n\n\n### Region 2: Alpine region[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The alpine tundra of Rocky Mountain National Park taken along the Tundra Communities Trail at approximately 12,000 feet.\nRegion 2 is the alpine region of the park with accessible tundra trails at high elevations—an area known for its spectacular vistas.[36] Within this region is Mount Ida, with tundra slopes and a wide-open view of the Continental Divide. Forest Canyon Pass is near the top of the Old Ute Trail that once linked villages across the Continental Divide.[41]\n\n\nChapin Pass trail traverses a dense forest to beautiful views of the Chapin Creek valley, proceeding onward above timberline to the western flank of Mount Chapin. Tundra Communities Trail, accessible from Trail Ridge Road, is a hike offering tundra views and alpine wildflowers. Other trails are Tombstone Ridge and Ute Trail, which starts at the tundra and is mostly downhill from Ute Crossing to Upper Beaver Meadows, with one backcountry camping site. Cache La Poudre River trail begins north of Poudre Lake on the west side of the valley near Milner Pass and heads downward toward the Mummy Pass trail junction. Lake Irene is a recreation and picnic area.[41]\n\n\n\n### Region 3: Wilderness[edit]\n\n\nRegion 3, known for wilderness escape, is in the northern part of the park and is accessed from the Estes Park area.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ypsilon Mountain from the Ypsilon Lake Trail\nThe Mummy Range is a short mountain range in the north of the park. The Mummies tend to be gentler and more forested than the other peaks in the park, though some slopes are rugged and heavily glaciated, particularly around Ypsilon Mountain and Mummy Mountain. Bridal Veil Falls is a scenic point and trail accessible from the Cow Creek trailhead, at the Continental Divide Research Center.[42] West Creek Falls and Chasm Falls, near Old Fall River Road, are also in this region. The Alluvial Fan trail leads to a bridge over the river that had been the site of the Lawn Lake Flood.[43]\n\n\nLumpy Ridge Trail leads to Paul Bunyan's Boot at about 1.5 mi (2.4 km) from the trailhead, then Gem Lake, and a further 2.2 mi (3.5 km) to Balanced Rock.[44] Black Canyon Trail intersects Cow Creek Trail, forming part of the Gem Lake loop which goes through the old McGregor Ranch valley, passing Lumpy Ridge rock formations, with a loop hike that goes into the McGraw Ranch valley.[43]\n\n\nCow Creek Trail follows Cow Creek, with its many beaver ponds, extending past the Bridal Falls turnoff as the Dark Mountain trail, then joining the Black Canyon trail to intersect the Lawn Lake trail shortly below the lake.[43] North Boundary Trail connects to the Lost Lake trail system. North Fork Trail begins outside of the park in the Comanche Peak Wilderness before reaching the park boundary and ending at Lost Lake. Stormy Peaks Trail connects Colorado State University's Pingree Park campus in the Comanche Peak Wilderness and the North Fork Trail inside the park.[43]\n\n\nBeaver Mountain Loop, also used by horseback riders, passes through forests and meadows, crosses Beaver Brook and several aspen-filled drainages, and has a great view of Longs Peak.[43] Deer Mountain Trail gives a 360 degree view of eastern part of the park. The summit plateau of Deer Mountain offers expansive views of the Continental Divide. During the winter, the lower trail generally has little snow, though packed and drifted snow are to be expected on the switchbacks. Snow cover on the summit may be three to five feet deep, requiring the use of snowshoes or skis.[43]\n\n\nThe trail to Lake Estes in Estes Park meanders through a bird sanctuary, beside a golf course, along the Big Thompson River and Fish Creek, through the lakeside picnic area and along the lakeshore. The trail is used by birdwatchers, bikers and hikers.[43]\n\n\nLawn Lake Trail climbs to Lawn Lake and Crystal Lake, one of the parks deepest lakes, in the alpine ecosystem and along the course of the Roaring River. The river shows the massive damage caused by a dam failure in 1982 that claimed the lives of three campers. The trail is a strenuous snowshoe hike in the winter.[43] Ypsilon Lake Trail leads to its namesake as well as Chipmunk Lake, with views of Longs Peak, while traversing pine forests with grouseberry and bearberry bushes. The trail also offers views of the canyon gouged out by rampaging water that broke loose from Lawn Lake Dam in 1982. Visible is the south face of Ypsilon Mountain, with its Y shaped gash rising sharply from the shoreline.[43]\n\n\nGem Lake is high among the rounded granite domes of Lumpy Ridge. Untouched by glaciation, this outcrop of 1.8 billion-year-old granite has been sculpted by wind and chemical erosion into a backbone-like ridge. Pillars, potholes, and balanced rocks are found around the midpoint of the trail, along with views of the Estes Valley and Continental Divide.[43] Potts Puddle trail is accessible from the Black Canyon trail.[43]\n\n\n\n### Region 4: Heart of the park[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bear Lake\nRegion 4 is the heart of the park with easy road and trail access, great views, and lake hikes including the most popular trails.[36] Flattop Mountain is a tundra hike and the easiest hike to the Continental Divide in the park. Crossing over Flattop Mountain, the hike to Hallett Peak passes through three climate zones, traversing the ridge that supports Tyndall Glacier and finally ascending to the summit of Hallett Peak.[45]\n\n\nBear Lake is a high-elevation lake in a spruce and fir forest at the base of Hallett Peak and Flattop Mountain.[45] Bierstadt Lake sits atop a lateral moraine named Bierstadt Moraine, and drains into Mill Creek. There are several trails that lead to Bierstadt Lake through groves of aspens and lodgepole pines.[46] North of Bierstadt Moraine is Hollowell Park, a large and marshy meadow along Mill Creek. The Hollowell Park trail runs along Steep Mountain's south side. Ranches, lumber and sawmill enterprises operated in Hollowell Park into the early 1900s.[46]\n\n\nGlacial Basin was the site of a resort run by Abner and Alberta Sprague, after whom Sprague Lake is named. The lake is a shallow body of water that was created when the Spragues dammed Boulder Brook to create a fish pond. Sprague Lake is a popular place for birdwatching, hiking and viewing the mountain peaks, along with camping at the Glacier Basin campground.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)Emerald Lake and Hallett Peak\nDream Lake is one of the most-photographed lakes and is also noted for its winter snowshoeing. Emerald Lake is located directly below the saddle between Hallett Peak and Flattop Mountain, only a short hike beyond Dream Lake.[45] The shore of Lake Haiyaha (a Native American word for \"big rocks\") is surrounded by boulders along with ancient, twisted and picturesque pine trees growing out of rock crevices. Nymph Lake is named for the yellow lily, *Nymphaea polysepala*, on its surface. Lake Helene is at the head of Odessa Gorge, east of Notchtop Mountain. Two Rivers Lake is found along the hike to Odessa Lake from Bear Lake, and has one backcountry campsite. The Cub Lake trail passes Big Thompson River, flowery meadows, and stands of pine and aspen trees. Ice and deep snow are present during the winter, requiring the use of skis or snowshoes.[45]\n\n\nThe Fern Lake trail passes Arch Rock formations, The Pool, and the cascading water of Fern Falls. Two backcountry campsites are located near the lake, and two more are closer to the trailhead. Odessa Lake has two approaches: one is along the Flattop trail from Bear Lake while the other is from the Fern Lake trailhead, along which are Fern Creek, The Pool, Fern Falls, and Fern Lake itself. One backcountry campsite is available.[45] Other lakes are Jewel Lake, Mills Lake, Black Lake, Blue Lake, Lake of Glass, Sky Pond, and Spruce Lake.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)View from the summit of Hallett Peak\nThe Pool is a large turbulent water pocket formed below where Spruce and Fern Creeks join the Big Thompson River. The winter route is along a gravel road, which leads to a trail at the Fern Lake trailhead. Along the route are beaver-cut aspen, frozen waterfalls on the cliffs, and the Arch Rocks.[45] The trail to Alberta Falls runs by Glacier Creek and Glacier Gorge.[45]\n\n\nWind River Trail leaves the East Portal and follows the Wind River to join with the Storm Pass trail. There are three backcountry campsites.[45] Other sites in the area are The Loch, Loch Vale, Mill Creek Basin, Andrews Glacier, Sky Point, Timberline Falls, Upper Beaver Meadows, and Storm Pass.[45]\n\n\n\n### Region 5: Waterfalls and backcountry[edit]\n\n\nRegion 5, known for waterfalls and backcountry, is south of Estes Park and contains Longs Peak—the park's iconic fourteener—and the Wild Basin area.[36] Other peaks and passes include Lily Mountain, Estes Cone, Twin Sisters, Boulder-Grand Pass, and Granite Pass.[48] Eugenia Mine operated about the late-19th to early-20th century, with some old equipment and a log cabin remaining.[48] Sites and trails include Boulder Field, Wild Basin Trail, and Homer Rouse Memorial Trail.[48]\n\n\nEnos Mills, the main figure behind the creation of Rocky Mountain National Park, enjoyed walking to Lily Lake from his nearby cabin. Wildflowers are common in the spring and early summer. In the winter, the trail around the lake is often suitable for walking in boots, or as a short snowshoe or ski. Other lakes in the Wild Basin include Chasm Lake, Snowbank Lake, Lion Lakes 1 and 2, Thunder Lake, Ouzel Lake, Finch Lake, Bluebird Lake, Pear Lake, and Sandbeach Lake. Many of the lakes have backcountry campsites. Waterfalls include Ouzel Falls, Trio Falls, Copeland Falls, and Calypso Cascades.[48]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Rocky Mountain National Park has a Subarctic climate with cool summers and year around precipitation (*Dfc*). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at Bear Lake Ranger Station (9492 ft / 2893 m) is 5a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -15.2 °F (-26.2 °C), and 5a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -16.1 °F (-26.7 °C) at Beaver Meadows Visitor Center (7825 ft / 2385 m).[49]\n\n\nThe complex interactions of elevation, slope, exposure and regional-scale air masses determine the climate within the park,[50][51] which is noted for its extreme weather patterns.[51] A \"collision of air masses\" from several directions produces some of the key weather events in the region. When cold arctic air from the north meets warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico at the Front Range, \"intense, very wet snowfalls with total snow depth measured in the feet\" accumulate in the park.[50]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Bear Lake Ranger Station, Rocky Mountain National Park.

High country overnight trips require gear suitable for -35 °F or below.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wild roses (*Rosa acicularis*) bloom from montane to subalpine regions\nThe subalpine region does not begin to experience spring-like conditions until June. Wildflowers bloom from late June to early August.[51]\n\n\nBelow 9,400 feet (2,865 m), temperatures are often moderate, although nighttime temperatures are cool, as is typical of mountain weather.[51] Spring comes to the montane area by early May, when wildflowers begin to bloom. Spring weather is subject to unpredictable changes in temperature and precipitation, with potential for snow along trails through May.[51] In July and August, temperatures are generally in the 70s or 80s °F during the day, and as low as the 40s °F at night.[51] Lower elevations receive rain as most of their summer precipitation.[50]\n\n\nSudden dramatic changes in the weather may occur during the summer, typically due to afternoon thunderstorms that can cause as much as a 20 °F drop in temperature and windy conditions.[51]\n\n\n\n### Continental Divide[edit]\n\n\nThe park's climate is also affected by the Continental Divide, which runs northwest to southeast through the center of the park atop the high peaks. The Continental Divide creates two distinct climate patterns - one typical of the east side near Estes Park and the other associated with the Grand Lake area on the park's west side.[51] The west side of the park experiences more snow, less wind, and clear cold days during the winter months.[51]\n\n\n\n### Climate change study[edit]\n\n\nRocky Mountain National Park was selected to participate in a climate change study, along with two other National Park Service areas in the Rocky Mountain region and three in the Appalachian Mountain region.[53] The study began in 2011, orchestrated by members of the academic scientific community in cooperation with the National Park Service and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).[53] The stated objective: \"develop and apply decision support tools that use NASA and other data and models to assess vulnerability of ecosystems and species to climate and land use change and evaluate management options.\"[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)Trees killed by mountain pine beetles.\nAs of 2010[update], the preceding one hundred years of records indicated an increase in the average annual temperature of approximately 3 °F (1.7 °C).[50][55][a] The average low temperature has increased more than the average high temperature during the same time period.[50] As a result of the temperature increase, snow is melting from the mountains earlier in the year, leading to drier summers and probably to an earlier, longer fire season.[50] Since the 1990s, mountain pine beetles have reproduced more rapidly and have not died off at their previous mortality rate during the winter months. Consequently, the increased beetle population has led to an increased rate of tree mortality in the park.[56]\n\n\nThe climate change study projects further temperature increases, with greater warming in the summer and higher extreme temperatures by 2050. Due to the increased temperature, there is a projected moderate increase in the rate of water evaporation. Reduced snowfall—perhaps 15% to 30% less than current amounts—and the elimination of surface hail, along with the higher likelihood of intense precipitation events are predicted by 2050. Droughts may be more likely due to increased temperatures, increased evaporation rates, and potential changes in precipitation.[56]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geology of the Rocky Mountains and Prehistory of Colorado\n\nPrecambrian metamorphic rock formed the core of the North American continent during the Precambrian eon 4.5–1 billion years ago. During the Paleozoic era, western North America was submerged beneath a shallow sea, with a seabed composed of limestone and dolomite deposits many kilometers thick.[57] Pikes Peak granite formed during the late Precambrian eon, continuing well into the Paleozoic era, when mass quantities of molten rock flowed, amalgamated, and formed the continents about 1 billion–300 million years ago. Concurrently, in the period from 500 to 300 million years ago, the region began to sink while lime and mud sediments were deposited in the vacated space. Eroded granite produced sand particles that formed strata—layers of sediment—in the sinking basin.[58]: 1\n\n\nAbout 300 million years ago, the land was uplifted creating the ancestral Rocky Mountains.[58]: 1 Fountain Formation was deposited during the Pennsylvanian period of the Paleozoic era, 290–296 million years ago. Over the next 150 million years, the mountains uplifted, continued to erode, and covered themselves in their own sediment. Wind, gravity, rainwater, snow, and glacial ice eroded the granite mountains over geologic time scales.[58]: 6 The Ancestral Rockies were eventually buried under subsequent strata.[58]: 10\n\n\n\n![](image)The Western Interior Seaway 95 million years ago.\nThe Pierre Shale formation was deposited during the Paleogene and Cretaceous periods about 70 million years ago. The region was covered by a deep sea—the Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway—which deposited massive amounts of shale on the seabed. Both the thick stratum of shale and embedded marine life fossils—including ammonites and skeletons of fish and such marine reptiles as mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and extinct species of sea turtles, along with rare dinosaur and bird remains—were created during this time period. The area now known as Colorado was eventually transformed from being at the bottom of an ocean to dry land again, giving yield to another fossiliferous rock layer known as the Denver Formation.[58]: 16\n\n\nAt about 68 million years ago, the Front Range began to rise again due to the Laramide orogeny in the west.[58]: 16,[59]: 8 During the Cenozoic era, block uplift formed the present Rocky Mountains. The geologic composition of Rocky Mountain National Park was also affected by deformation and erosion during that era. The uplift disrupted the older drainage patterns and created the present drainage patterns.[59]: 8–9\n\n\n\n### Glaciation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Andrews Glacier\nGlacial geology in Rocky Mountain National Park can be seen from the mountain peaks to the valley floors. Ice is a powerful sculptor of this natural environment and large masses of moving ice are the most powerful tools. Telltale marks of giant glaciers can be seen all throughout the park. Streams and glaciations during the Quaternary period cut through the older sediment, creating mesa tops and alluvial plains, and revealing the present Rocky Mountains.[58]: 30 The glaciation removed as much as 5,000 feet (1,500 m) of sedimentary rocks from earlier inland sea deposits. This erosion exposed the basement rock of the Ancestral Rockies. Evidence of the uplifting and erosion can be found on the way to Rocky Mountain National Park in the hogbacks of the Front Range foothills.[59]: 8–9 Many sedimentary rocks from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras exist in the basins surrounding the park.[60]\n\n\nWhile the glaciation periods are largely in the past, the park still has several small glaciers.[61] The glaciers include Andrews, Sprague, Tyndall, Taylor, Rowe, Mills, and Moomaw Glaciers.[35]\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ecology of the Rocky Mountains\n\n![](image)Clickable examples of ecosystem elements\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Rocky Mountain National Park encompasses three classifications; an Alpine tundra & Barren (*52*) vegetation type with an Alpine tundra (*11*) vegetation form, a Western Spruce/Fir (*15*) vegetation type with a Rocky Mountain Conifer Forest (*3*) vegetation form, and a Pine/Douglas fir (*18*) vegetation type with a Rocky Mountain Conifer Forest (*3*) vegetation form.[62]\n\n\nColorado has one of the most diverse plant and animal environments of the United States, partially due to the dramatic temperature differences arising from varying elevation levels and topography. In dry climates, the average temperature drops 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit with every 1,000 foot increase in elevation (9.8 degrees Celsius per 1,000 meters). Most of Colorado is semi-arid with the mountains receiving the greatest amount of precipitation in the state.[63]\n\n\nThe Continental Divide runs north to south through the park, creating a climatic division. Ancient glaciers carved the topography into a range of ecological zones.[31] The east side of the Divide tends to be drier with heavily glaciated peaks and cirques. The west side of the park is wetter with more lush, deep forests.[64]\n\n\nThere are four ecosystems, or zones, in Rocky Mountain National Park: montane, subalpine, alpine tundra, and riparian. The riparian zone occurs throughout all of the three other zones. Each individual ecosystem is composed of organisms interacting with one other and with their surrounding environment. Living organisms (biotic), along with the dead organic matter they produce, and the abiotic (non-living) environment that impacts those living organisms (water, weather, rocks, and landscape) are all members of an ecosystem.[65]\n\n\nThe park was designated a World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations in 1976 to protect its natural resources.[66][67] The park's biodiversity includes afforestation and reforestation, ecology, inland bodies of water, and mammals, while its ecosystems are managed for nature conservation, environmental education and public recreation purposes.[66] The areas of research and monitoring include ungulate ecology and management, high-altitude revegetation, global change, acid precipitation effects, and aquatic ecology and management.[66]\n\n\nFor a checklist of plants with photographic images) in the Rocky Mountain National Park, see Checklist RMNP.\n\n\n\n### Montane zone[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View from the Fall River Road illustrating the montane ecosystem with forested slopes and grassland in between\nThe montane ecosystem is at the lowest elevations in the park, between 5,600 to 9,500 feet (1,700 to 2,900 m), where the slopes and large meadow valleys support the widest range of plant and animal life,[68][69] including montane forests, grasslands, and shrublands. The area has meandering rivers[69] and during the summer, wildflowers grow in the open meadows. Ponderosa pine trees, grass, shrubs and herbs live on dry, south-facing slopes. North-facing slopes retain moisture better than those that face south. The soil better supports dense populations of trees, like Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, and ponderosa pine. There are also occasional Engelmann spruce and blue spruce trees. Quaking aspens thrive in high-moisture montane soils. Other water-loving small trees like willows, grey alder, and water birch may be found along streams or lakeshores. Water-logged soil in flat montane valleys may be unable to support growth of evergreen forests.[69] The following areas are part of the montane ecosystem: Moraine Park, Horseshoe Park, Kawuneeche Valley, and Upper Beaver Meadows.[69]\n\n\nSome of the mammals that inhabit the montane ecosystem include snowshoe hares, coyotes, cougars, beavers, mule deer, moose, bighorn sheep, black bears, and Rocky Mountain elk.[69] During the fall, visitors often flock to the park to witness the elk rut.[70]\n\n\n\n### Subalpine zone[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rocky Mountains subalpine zone\n\nFrom 9,000 ft (2,700 m) to 11,000 ft (3,400 m),[71] the montane forests give way to subalpine forests.[68] Forests of fir and Engelmann spruce cover the mountainsides in subalpine areas. Trees grow straight and tall in the lower subalpine forests, but become shorter and more deformed the nearer they are to the tree line.[71] At the tree line, seedlings may germinate on the lee side of rocks and grow only as high as the rock provides wind protection, with any further growth being more horizontal than vertical. The low growth of dense trees is called krummholz, which may become well-established and live for several hundred to a thousand years old.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Odessa Lake in the subalpine ecosystem\nIn the subalpine zone, lodgepole pines and huckleberry have established themselves in previous burn areas. Crystal clear lakes and fields of wildflowers are hidden among the trees. Mammals of the subalpine zone include bobcats, cougars, coyotes, elk, mule deer, chipmunks, shrews, porcupines and yellow-bellied marmots. Black bears are attracted by the berries and seeds of subalpine forests. Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, mountain chickadee and yellow-rumped warbler are some of the many birds found in the subalpine zone.[71] Sprague Lake and Odessa Lake are two of the park's subalpine lakes.[71]\n\n\n\n### Alpine tundra[edit]\n\n\nAbove tree line, at approximately 11,000 ft (3,400 m), trees disappear and the vast alpine tundra takes over.[68] Over one third of the park resides above the tree line, an area which limits plant growth due to the cold climate and strong winds. The few plants that can survive under such extreme conditions are mostly perennials. Many alpine plants are dwarfed at high elevations, though their occasional blossoms may be full-sized.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)View on Tundra Communities Trail\nCushion plants have long taproots that extend deep into the rocky soil. Their diminutive size, like clumps of moss, limits the effect of harsh winds. Many flowering plants of the tundra have dense hairs on stems and leaves to provide wind protection or red-colored pigments capable of converting the sun's light rays into heat. Some plants take two or more years to form flower buds, which survive the winter below the surface and then open and produce fruit with seeds in the few weeks of summer. Grasses and sedges are common where tundra soil is well-developed.[72]\n\n\nNon-flowering lichens cling to rocks and soil. Their enclosed algal cells can photosynthesize at any temperature above 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 °C), and the outer fungal layers can absorb more than their own weight in water. Adaptations for survival amidst drying winds and cold temperatures may make tundra vegetation seem very hardy, but in some respects it remains very fragile. Footsteps can destroy tundra plants and it may take hundreds of years to recover.[72] Mammals that live on the alpine tundra, or visit during the summer season, include bighorn sheep, elk, badgers, pikas, yellow-bellied marmots, and snowshoe hares. Birds include prairie falcons, white-tailed ptarmigans, and common ravens. Flowering plants include mertensia, sky pilot, alpine sunflowers, alpine dwarf columbine, and alpine forget-me-not. Grasses include kobresia, spike trisetum, spreading wheatgrass, and tufted hairgrass.[72]\n\n\n\n### Riparian zone[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mountain stream along Fall River Road is an example of a riparian ecosystem.\nThe riparian ecosystem runs through the montane, subalpine, and alpine tundra zones and creates a foundation for life, especially for species that thrive next to streams, rivers, and lakes.[73] The headwaters of the Colorado River, which provides water to many of the southwestern states, are located on the west side of the park. The Fall River, Cache la Poudre River and Big Thompson Rivers are located on the east side of the park. Just like the other ecosystems in the park, the riparian zone is affected by the climatic variables of temperature, precipitation, and elevation. Generally, riparian zones in valleys will have cooler temperatures than communities located on slopes and ridge tops. Depending on elevation, a riparian zone may have more or less precipitation than other riparian zones in the park, with the difference creating a shift in the types of plants and animals found in a specific zone.[74]\n\n\n\n### Wildlife[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mammals of Rocky Mountain National Park\n\nRocky Mountain National Park is home to many species of animals, including nearly seventy mammals and almost three hundred species of birds. This diversity is due to the park's varying topography, which creates a variety of habitats. However, some species have been extirpated from the park, including gray wolf, wolverine, grizzly bear, and American bison. Moose are commonly seen in the park, but they were not historically recorded as being part of this particular area of the Rocky Mountains.[75]\n\n\n\n#### Elk[edit]\n\n\nThe park is home to some 2,000 to 3,000 elk in summer, and between 800 and 1,000 elk spend the winter within its boundaries. Because of lack of predators such as wolves, the National Park Service culls around 50 elk each winter.[76] Overgrazing by elk has become a major problem in the park's riparian areas, so much so that the NPS fences them out of many critical wetland habitats to let willows and aspens grow. The program seems to be working, as the deciduous wetland plants thrive within the fencing. Many people think the elk herd is too large, but are reluctant to reintroduce predators because of its proximity to large human populations and ranches.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Other ungulates[edit]\n\n\nMany other ungulates reside in the park, including bighorn sheep, moose, and mule deer. Bison were eliminated from the park in the 1800s, as were pronghorn and moose, the latter of which was restored to the area in 1978. Moose are now frequently seen in the park, especially on the park's west side.[78] The park's bighorn sheep population has recovered and is estimated at 350 animals.[79]\n\n\n\n#### Predators[edit]\n\n\nThe park is home to many predatory animals, including Canada lynx, foxes, bobcat, cougar, black bear, and coyotes. Wolves and grizzly bears were extirpated in the early 1900s. Most of these predators kill smaller animals, but mountain lions and coyotes kill deer and occasionally elk. Bears also eat larger prey. Moose have no predators in the park. Black bears are relatively uncommon in the park, numbering only 24-35 animals. They also have fewer cubs and the bears seem skinnier than they do in most areas.[80] Canadian lynx are quite rare within the park, and they have probably spread north from the San Juan Mountains, where they were reintroduced in 1999. Cougars feed mainly on mule deer in the park, and live 10–13 years. Cougar territories can be as large as 500 square miles (1,300 km2).[81] Coyotes hunt both alone and in pairs, but occasionally hunt in packs. They mainly feed on rodents but occasionally bring down larger animals, including deer, and especially fawns and elk calves. Scat studies in Moraine Park showed that their primary foods were deer and rodents. They form strong family bonds and are very vocal.[82]\n\n\n\n## Recreational activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Longs Peak seen from Dream Lake trail\nThe park contains a network of trails that range from easy, paved paths suitable for all visitors including those with disabilities, to strenuous mountain trails for experienced, conditioned hikers as well as off-trail routes for backcountry hikes. Trails lead to more than 100 designated wilderness camping sites.[83] From either the Bear Lake or Grand Lake trailheads, backpackers can hike a 45 mi (72 km) loop along the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail within the park.[84] Most trails are for summer use only, since at other times of the year many trails are not safe due to weather conditions.[85] Horseback riding is permitted on most trails,[86] as are llamas and other pack animals.[87]\n\n\nRock climbing and mountaineering opportunities include Lumpy Ridge,[88] Hallett Peak, Chiefs Head Peak, and Longs Peak, the highest peak in the park, with the easiest route being the Keyhole Route. This 8 mi (13 km) one-way climb has an elevation gain of 4,850 ft (1,480 m). The vast east face, including the area known as The Diamond, is home to many classic big wall rock climbing routes. Many of the highest peaks have technical ice and rock routes on them, ranging from short scrambles to long multi-pitch climbs.[89] Bouldering is popular in the park as well, as it is often considered a \"mecca for boulderers around the world\", particularly the Emerald Lake and Chaos Canyon areas.[90]\n\n\nFishing is permitted at many of the park's lakes and streams. Four trout species inhabit park waters: rainbow, brook, cutthroat, and German brown trout.[86] The greenback cutthroat, once widespread in Eastern Colorado, is currently listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n\nDuring the winter most of Trail Ridge Road is closed due to heavy snow, limiting motorized access to the edges of the park.[67] Winter activities include snowshoeing and cross-country skiing which are possible from either the Estes Park or Grand Lake entrances. On the east side near Estes Park, skiing and snowshoeing trails are available off Bear Lake Road, such as the Bear Lake, Bierstadt Lake, and Sprague Lake trails and at Hidden Valley. Slopes for sledding are also available at Hidden Valley. The west side of the park near Grand Lake also has viable snowshoeing trails.[67][91] Backcountry skiing and snowboarding can be enjoyed after climbing up one of the higher slopes, especially late in the snow season after avalanche danger has subsided[92] and technical climbing remains also a possibility, although typically differing in style from the summer months.[93]\n\n\n\n## Hazards[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Hazards of outdoor recreation and Mountaineering § Hazards\n\nEncountering bears is a concern in much of the Rocky Mountains, including the Wind River Range.[94] There are other concerns as well, including bugs, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures.[95]\n\n\nThere have been notable incidents, including accidental deaths, due to falls from steep cliffs (a misstep could be fatal in this class 4/5 terrain) and due to falling rocks, over the years, including 1993,[96] 2007 (involving an experienced NOLS leader),[97] 2015[98] and 2018.[99] Other incidents include a seriously injured backpacker being airlifted near SquareTop Mountain[100] in 2005,[101] and a fatal hiker incident (from an apparent accidental fall) in 2006 that involved state search and rescue.[102] The U.S. Forest Service does not offer updated aggregated records on the official number of fatalities in such areas, including the Wind River Range.\n\n\n\n### Wildfires[edit]\n\n\nWildfires have been recorded in Rocky Mountain National Park prior to its establishment in 1915. Some of the most notable wildfires include the Bear Lake Fire, which was started by a campfire that was failed to be properly put out, and burned for two months in 1900. The Ouzel Fire in 1978 was caused naturally by lightning and was allowed to burn under supervision until it grew out of control and in total burned 1,050 acres of land. The Fern Lake Fire in 2012 was also caused by a campfire, the fire was intensified due to strong winds and drought in the area. Absence of fire in around Fern Lake for many centuries caused excessive dead trees and a thick layer of organic matter on the ground which fuelled the fire, ultimately leading to the it lasting for over two months, burning nearly 3,500 acres of land.[103]\n\n\nAn increase in average temperature in the Rocky Mountain region has been correlated to a decrease in snowfall that melts earlier in the year, attributing to drier summers and longer fire seasons. Rocky Mountain National Park is expected to see one of the largest increases in number of wildfires for the United States, with an increase in both duration and intensity for wildfires in general across the nation.[104][105]\n\n\nWildfires that have a higher burn severity can cause serious damage to an ecosystem. High-severity wildfires can cause soil degradation by affecting the soils’ ability to absorb and process water. They also cause an increase in erosion due to burning away vegetation that holds the soil to the ground, thus increasing the chances of flooding and mudslides that cause further damage in and around the affected areas. Ash from the fires also contributes significantly to air and water pollution.[106][107]\n\n\nLow-severity wildfires however are crucial to maintaining a balanced ecosystem and can help prevent the damaging high-severity wildfires by clearing away excess organic material that adds fuel to and amplifies the spread of more severe wildfires. While severe fires can negatively impact the soil, less severe wildfires can be beneficial as burning the nutrient-rich dead organic material helps to fertilize the soil. The smaller fires also clear room for new growth and can fight against invasive species encroachment in the park.[105][108]\n\n\nMany parks including Rocky Mountain National Park use small fires as means to prevent more severe fires from getting out of hand. Along with small, prescribed burns, other fuel management practices include removing low hanging branches and forest thinning in general. Scientists have been working hard to find a balance in wildfires, allowing them to work as a restorative ecological process while avoiding the damage and pollution that come with high-severity wildfires.[105]\n\n\n\n## Access[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Trail Ridge Road is the highest continuously paved highway in the United States.\nThe park may be accessed through Estes Park or via the western entrance at Grand Lake. Trail Ridge Road, also known as U.S. Route 34, connects the eastern and western sides of the park.[109] The park has a total of five visitor centers. The Alpine Visitor Center is located in the tundra environment along Trail Ridge Road, while Beaver Meadows and Fall River are both near Estes Park, with Kawuneeche in the Grand Lake area, and the Moraine Park Discovery Center near the Beaver Meadows entrance and visitor center.[11]\n\n\n\n### Trail Ridge Road and other roads[edit]\n\n\nTrail Ridge Road is 48 miles (77 km) long and connects the entrances in Grand Lake and Estes Park.[110][111] Running generally east–west through many hairpin turns,[6] the road crosses Milner Pass through the Continental Divide[111] at an elevation of 10,758 ft (3,279 m).[110][112] The highest point of the road is 12,183 feet (3,713 m),[111] with eleven miles of the road being above tree line which is approximately 11,500 feet (3,505 m).[110] The road is the highest continuously paved highway in the country,[111] and includes many large turnouts at key points to stop and observe the scenery.[110]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schematic map of Trail Ridge Road's northern sections\nMost visitors to the park drive over the famous Trail Ridge Road, but other roads include Fall River Road and Bear Lake Road.[113] The park is open every day of the year, weather permitting.[114] Due to the extended winter season in higher elevations, Trail Ridge Road between Many Parks Curve and the Colorado River Trailhead is closed much of the year. The road is usually open again by Memorial Day and closes in mid-October, generally after Columbus Day.[111] Fall River Road does not open until about July 4 and closes by, or in, October for vehicular traffic.[115] Snow may also fall in sufficient quantities in higher elevations to require temporary closure of the roads into July,[51][111] which is reported on the road status site.[113]\n\n\n\n### Estes Park[edit]\n\n\nMost visitors enter the park through the eastern entrances near Estes Park, which is about 71 miles (114 km) northwest of Denver.[109] The most direct route to Trail Ridge Road is the Beaver Meadows entrance, located just west of Estes Park on U.S. Route 36, which leads to the Beaver Meadows Visitor Center and the park's headquarters. North of the Beaver Meadows entrance station is the Fall River entrance, which also leads to Trail Ridge Road and Old Fall River Road.[109] There are three routes into Estes Park: I-25 to U.S. 34 west which runs alongside the Big Thompson River; U.S. 36 west (northwest) from Boulder connecting to U.S. 34 west; and the Peak to Peak Highway, also known as State Highway 7, from points south.[109]\n\n\nThe nearest airport is Denver International Airport[109] and the closest train station is the Denver Union Station. Estes Park may be reached by rental car or shuttle.[109][116] During peak tourist season, there is free shuttle service within the park; additionally, the town of Estes Park provides shuttle service to Estes Park Visitor Center, surrounding campgrounds, and the Rocky Mountain National Park's shuttles.[109]\n\n\n\n### Grand Lake[edit]\n\n\nVisitors may also enter at the western side of the park from U.S. 34 near Grand Lake. U.S. 34 is reached by taking U.S. 40 north from I-70.[109] The closest railroad station is the Amtrak station in Granby, which is 20 miles (32 km) from the western entrance of the park. Taxi service is available into the park.[116]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Environment portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n* ![](image)History portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![flag](image)Colorado portal\n\n\n* List of areas in the United States National Park System – parks, monuments, preserves, historic sites, etc.\n* Birds of Rocky Mountain National Park\n* List of national parks of the United States\n* Southern Rocky Mountain Front - where the Rocky Mountains meet the plains\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Montana State University states in their profile of Rocky Mountain National Park that there has been an increase of 2.5 °F (1.4 °C) in the average park temperature over \"the past century\" (charts show the period from about 1895 to 2010).[50] The National Park Service site states that the increase has been 3.4 °F (1.9 °C) over \"the last century\" (chart shows the period from about 1905-2010).[55]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rocky Mountain in United States of America Archived 2019-07-24 at the Wayback Machine. *protectedplanet.net*.

The park is situated between the towns of Estes Park to the east and Grand Lake to the west. The eastern and western slopes of the Continental Divide run directly through the center of the park with the headwaters of the Colorado River located in the park's northwestern region.[6] The main features of the park include mountains, alpine lakes and a wide variety of wildlife within various climates and environments, from wooded forests to mountain tundra.\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountain National Park Act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson on January 26, 1915, establishing the park boundaries and protecting the area for future generations.[3] The Civilian Conservation Corps built the main automobile route, Trail Ridge Road, in the 1930s.[3] In 1976, UNESCO designated the park as one of the first World Biosphere Reserves.[7] In 2018, more than 4.5 million recreational visitors entered the park.[8] The park is one of the most visited in the National Park System, ranking as the third most visited national park in 2015.[9] In 2019, the park saw record attendance yet again with 4,678,804 visitors, a 44% increase since 2012.[10]\n\n\nThe park has a total of five visitor centers,[11] with park headquarters located at the Beaver Meadows Visitor Center—a National Historic Landmark designed by the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture at Taliesin West.[12] National Forest lands surround the park on all sides, including Roosevelt National Forest to the north and east, Routt National Forest to the north and west, and Arapaho National Forest to the west and south, with the Indian Peaks Wilderness area located directly south of the park.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Location of the Rocky Mountains\nMain article: History of Rocky Mountain National Park\n\nThe history of Rocky Mountain National Park began when Paleo-Indians traveled along what is now Trail Ridge Road to hunt and forage for food.[13] Ute and Arapaho people subsequently hunted and camped in the area.[14][15] In 1820, the Long Expedition, led by Stephen H. Long for whom Longs Peak was named, approached the Rockies via the Platte River.[16][17] Settlers began arriving in the mid-1800s,[18] displacing the Native Americans who mostly left the area voluntarily by 1860,[19] while others were removed to reservations by 1878.[15]\n\n\nLulu City, Dutchtown, and Gaskill in the Never Summer Mountains were established in the 1870s when prospectors came in search of gold and silver.[20] The boom ended by 1883 with miners deserting their claims.[21] The railroad reached Lyons, Colorado in 1881 and the Big Thompson Canyon Road—a section of U.S. Route 34 from Loveland to Estes Park—was completed in 1904.[22] The 1920s saw a boom in building lodges, including the Bear Lake Trail School, and roads in the park, culminating with the construction of Trail Ridge Road to Fall River Pass between 1929 and 1932, then to Grand Lake by 1938.[23]\n\n\nProminent individuals in the effort to create a national park included Enos Mills from the Estes Park area, James Grafton Rogers from Denver, and J. Horace McFarland of Pennsylvania.[24] The national park was established on January 26, 1915.[3]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of peaks in Rocky Mountain National Park\n\n![](image)View from Forest Canyon Overlook along Trail Ridge Road\nRocky Mountain National Park encompasses 265,461 acres (414.78 sq mi; 1,074.28 km2) of federal land,[2] with an additional 253,059 acres (395.40 sq mi; 1,024.09 km2) of U.S. Forest Service wilderness adjoining the park boundaries.[25] The Continental Divide runs generally north–south through the center of the park,[26] with rivers and streams on the western side of the divide flowing toward the Pacific Ocean while those on the eastern side flow toward the Atlantic.[27]\n\n\nA geographical anomaly is found along the slopes of the Never Summer Mountains where the Continental Divide forms a horseshoe–shaped bend for about 6 miles (9.7 km), heading from south–to–north but then curving sharply southward and westward out of the park.[6][28] The sharp bend results in streams on the eastern slopes of the range joining the headwaters of the Colorado River that flow south and west, eventually reaching the Pacific.[6][29] Meanwhile, streams on the western slopes join rivers that flow north and then east and south, eventually reaching the Atlantic.[6][29]\n\n\n\n![](image)View from *Many Parks Curve* on Trail Ridge Road. The \"parks\" in the Rockies are meadows that formed when glacial lakes drained.\nThe headwaters of the Colorado River are located in the park's northwestern region.[26] The park contains approximately 450 miles (724 km) of rivers and streams, 350 miles (563 km) of trails, and 150 lakes.[26][30]\n\n\nRocky Mountain National Park is one of the highest national parks in the nation, with elevations from 7,860 to 14,259 feet (2,396 to 4,346 m),[31] the highest point of which is Longs Peak.[32] Trail Ridge Road is the highest paved through-road in the country, with a peak elevation of 12,183 feet (3,713 m).[33] Sixty mountain peaks over 12,000 feet (3,658 m) high provide scenic vistas.[31] On the north side of the park, the Mummy Range contains a number of thirteener peaks, including Hagues Peak, Mummy Mountain, Fairchild Mountain, Ypsilon Mountain, and Mount Chiquita.[34] Several small glaciers and permanent snowfields are found in the high mountain cirques.[35]\n\n\nThere are five regions, or geographical zones, within the park.\n\n\n\n### Region 1: Moose and big meadows[edit]\n\n\nRegion 1 is known for moose and big meadows and is located on the west, or Grand Lake, side of the Continental Divide.[36] Thirty miles of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail loop through the park and pass through alpine tundra and scenery.[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bull elk in a meadow near the headwaters of the Colorado River\nThe Big Meadows area with its grasses and wildflowers can be reached via the Onahu, Tonahutu, or Green Mountain trail. Other scenic areas include Long Meadows and the Kawuneeche Valley (Coyote Valley) of the upper Colorado River which is a good place for birdwatching, as well as snowshoeing and cross-country skiing in winter. The valley trail loops through Kawuneeche Valley[37] which contained as many as 39 mines, though less than 20 of those have archived records and archeological remains.[38] LuLu City is the site of an abandoned silver mining town of the early 1880s located along the Colorado River Trail.[6] According to a 1985 report prepared for the NRHP, there were only three cabin ruins remaining along with remnants of six other buildings.[39]\n\n\nBaker Pass crosses the Continental Divide through the Never Summer Mountains and into the Michigan River drainage to the west of Mount Nimbus[37]—a drainage that feeds streams and rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico.[29] Other mountain passes are La Poudre Pass and Thunder Pass, which was once used by stage coaches and is a route to Michigan Lakes. Little Yellowstone has geological features similar to the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The Green Mountain trail once was a wagon road used to haul hay from Big Meadows. Flattop Mountain, which can be accessed from the eastern and western sides of the park, is near Green Mountain. Shadow Mountain Lookout—a wildfire observation tower—is on the National Register of Historic Places.[37] Paradise Park Natural Area is an essentially hidden and protected wild area with no maintained trails penetrating it.[40]\n\n\nSkeleton Gulch, Cascade Falls, North Inlet Falls, Granite Falls, and Adams Falls are found in the west side of the park. The west side lakes include Bowen Lake, Lake Verna, Lake of the Clouds, Haynach Lakes, Timber Lake, Lone Pine Lake, Lake Nanita, and Lake Nokoni.[37]\n\n\n\n### Region 2: Alpine region[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The alpine tundra of Rocky Mountain National Park taken along the Tundra Communities Trail at approximately 12,000 feet.\nRegion 2 is the alpine region of the park with accessible tundra trails at high elevations—an area known for its spectacular vistas.[36] Within this region is Mount Ida, with tundra slopes and a wide-open view of the Continental Divide. Forest Canyon Pass is near the top of the Old Ute Trail that once linked villages across the Continental Divide.[41]\n\n\nChapin Pass trail traverses a dense forest to beautiful views of the Chapin Creek valley, proceeding onward above timberline to the western flank of Mount Chapin. Tundra Communities Trail, accessible from Trail Ridge Road, is a hike offering tundra views and alpine wildflowers. Other trails are Tombstone Ridge and Ute Trail, which starts at the tundra and is mostly downhill from Ute Crossing to Upper Beaver Meadows, with one backcountry camping site. Cache La Poudre River trail begins north of Poudre Lake on the west side of the valley near Milner Pass and heads downward toward the Mummy Pass trail junction. Lake Irene is a recreation and picnic area.[41]\n\n\n\n### Region 3: Wilderness[edit]\n\n\nRegion 3, known for wilderness escape, is in the northern part of the park and is accessed from the Estes Park area.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ypsilon Mountain from the Ypsilon Lake Trail\nThe Mummy Range is a short mountain range in the north of the park. The Mummies tend to be gentler and more forested than the other peaks in the park, though some slopes are rugged and heavily glaciated, particularly around Ypsilon Mountain and Mummy Mountain. Bridal Veil Falls is a scenic point and trail accessible from the Cow Creek trailhead, at the Continental Divide Research Center.[42] West Creek Falls and Chasm Falls, near Old Fall River Road, are also in this region. The Alluvial Fan trail leads to a bridge over the river that had been the site of the Lawn Lake Flood.[43]\n\n\nLumpy Ridge Trail leads to Paul Bunyan's Boot at about 1.5 mi (2.4 km) from the trailhead, then Gem Lake, and a further 2.2 mi (3.5 km) to Balanced Rock.[44] Black Canyon Trail intersects Cow Creek Trail, forming part of the Gem Lake loop which goes through the old McGregor Ranch valley, passing Lumpy Ridge rock formations, with a loop hike that goes into the McGraw Ranch valley.[43]\n\n\nCow Creek Trail follows Cow Creek, with its many beaver ponds, extending past the Bridal Falls turnoff as the Dark Mountain trail, then joining the Black Canyon trail to intersect the Lawn Lake trail shortly below the lake.[43] North Boundary Trail connects to the Lost Lake trail system. North Fork Trail begins outside of the park in the Comanche Peak Wilderness before reaching the park boundary and ending at Lost Lake. Stormy Peaks Trail connects Colorado State University's Pingree Park campus in the Comanche Peak Wilderness and the North Fork Trail inside the park.[43]\n\n\nBeaver Mountain Loop, also used by horseback riders, passes through forests and meadows, crosses Beaver Brook and several aspen-filled drainages, and has a great view of Longs Peak.[43] Deer Mountain Trail gives a 360 degree view of eastern part of the park. The summit plateau of Deer Mountain offers expansive views of the Continental Divide. During the winter, the lower trail generally has little snow, though packed and drifted snow are to be expected on the switchbacks. Snow cover on the summit may be three to five feet deep, requiring the use of snowshoes or skis.[43]\n\n\nThe trail to Lake Estes in Estes Park meanders through a bird sanctuary, beside a golf course, along the Big Thompson River and Fish Creek, through the lakeside picnic area and along the lakeshore. The trail is used by birdwatchers, bikers and hikers.[43]\n\n\nLawn Lake Trail climbs to Lawn Lake and Crystal Lake, one of the parks deepest lakes, in the alpine ecosystem and along the course of the Roaring River. The river shows the massive damage caused by a dam failure in 1982 that claimed the lives of three campers. The trail is a strenuous snowshoe hike in the winter.[43] Ypsilon Lake Trail leads to its namesake as well as Chipmunk Lake, with views of Longs Peak, while traversing pine forests with grouseberry and bearberry bushes. The trail also offers views of the canyon gouged out by rampaging water that broke loose from Lawn Lake Dam in 1982. Visible is the south face of Ypsilon Mountain, with its Y shaped gash rising sharply from the shoreline.[43]\n\n\nGem Lake is high among the rounded granite domes of Lumpy Ridge. Untouched by glaciation, this outcrop of 1.8 billion-year-old granite has been sculpted by wind and chemical erosion into a backbone-like ridge. Pillars, potholes, and balanced rocks are found around the midpoint of the trail, along with views of the Estes Valley and Continental Divide.[43] Potts Puddle trail is accessible from the Black Canyon trail.[43]\n\n\n\n### Region 4: Heart of the park[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bear Lake\nRegion 4 is the heart of the park with easy road and trail access, great views, and lake hikes including the most popular trails.[36] Flattop Mountain is a tundra hike and the easiest hike to the Continental Divide in the park. Crossing over Flattop Mountain, the hike to Hallett Peak passes through three climate zones, traversing the ridge that supports Tyndall Glacier and finally ascending to the summit of Hallett Peak.[45]\n\n\nBear Lake is a high-elevation lake in a spruce and fir forest at the base of Hallett Peak and Flattop Mountain.[45] Bierstadt Lake sits atop a lateral moraine named Bierstadt Moraine, and drains into Mill Creek. There are several trails that lead to Bierstadt Lake through groves of aspens and lodgepole pines.[46] North of Bierstadt Moraine is Hollowell Park, a large and marshy meadow along Mill Creek. The Hollowell Park trail runs along Steep Mountain's south side. Ranches, lumber and sawmill enterprises operated in Hollowell Park into the early 1900s.[46]\n\n\nGlacial Basin was the site of a resort run by Abner and Alberta Sprague, after whom Sprague Lake is named. The lake is a shallow body of water that was created when the Spragues dammed Boulder Brook to create a fish pond. Sprague Lake is a popular place for birdwatching, hiking and viewing the mountain peaks, along with camping at the Glacier Basin campground.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)Emerald Lake and Hallett Peak\nDream Lake is one of the most-photographed lakes and is also noted for its winter snowshoeing. Emerald Lake is located directly below the saddle between Hallett Peak and Flattop Mountain, only a short hike beyond Dream Lake.[45] The shore of Lake Haiyaha (a Native American word for \"big rocks\") is surrounded by boulders along with ancient, twisted and picturesque pine trees growing out of rock crevices. Nymph Lake is named for the yellow lily, *Nymphaea polysepala*, on its surface. Lake Helene is at the head of Odessa Gorge, east of Notchtop Mountain. Two Rivers Lake is found along the hike to Odessa Lake from Bear Lake, and has one backcountry campsite. The Cub Lake trail passes Big Thompson River, flowery meadows, and stands of pine and aspen trees. Ice and deep snow are present during the winter, requiring the use of skis or snowshoes.[45]\n\n\nThe Fern Lake trail passes Arch Rock formations, The Pool, and the cascading water of Fern Falls. Two backcountry campsites are located near the lake, and two more are closer to the trailhead. Odessa Lake has two approaches: one is along the Flattop trail from Bear Lake while the other is from the Fern Lake trailhead, along which are Fern Creek, The Pool, Fern Falls, and Fern Lake itself. One backcountry campsite is available.[45] Other lakes are Jewel Lake, Mills Lake, Black Lake, Blue Lake, Lake of Glass, Sky Pond, and Spruce Lake.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)View from the summit of Hallett Peak\nThe Pool is a large turbulent water pocket formed below where Spruce and Fern Creeks join the Big Thompson River. The winter route is along a gravel road, which leads to a trail at the Fern Lake trailhead. Along the route are beaver-cut aspen, frozen waterfalls on the cliffs, and the Arch Rocks.[45] The trail to Alberta Falls runs by Glacier Creek and Glacier Gorge.[45]\n\n\nWind River Trail leaves the East Portal and follows the Wind River to join with the Storm Pass trail. There are three backcountry campsites.[45] Other sites in the area are The Loch, Loch Vale, Mill Creek Basin, Andrews Glacier, Sky Point, Timberline Falls, Upper Beaver Meadows, and Storm Pass.[45]\n\n\n\n### Region 5: Waterfalls and backcountry[edit]\n\n\nRegion 5, known for waterfalls and backcountry, is south of Estes Park and contains Longs Peak—the park's iconic fourteener—and the Wild Basin area.[36] Other peaks and passes include Lily Mountain, Estes Cone, Twin Sisters, Boulder-Grand Pass, and Granite Pass.[48] Eugenia Mine operated about the late-19th to early-20th century, with some old equipment and a log cabin remaining.[48] Sites and trails include Boulder Field, Wild Basin Trail, and Homer Rouse Memorial Trail.[48]\n\n\nEnos Mills, the main figure behind the creation of Rocky Mountain National Park, enjoyed walking to Lily Lake from his nearby cabin. Wildflowers are common in the spring and early summer. In the winter, the trail around the lake is often suitable for walking in boots, or as a short snowshoe or ski. Other lakes in the Wild Basin include Chasm Lake, Snowbank Lake, Lion Lakes 1 and 2, Thunder Lake, Ouzel Lake, Finch Lake, Bluebird Lake, Pear Lake, and Sandbeach Lake. Many of the lakes have backcountry campsites. Waterfalls include Ouzel Falls, Trio Falls, Copeland Falls, and Calypso Cascades.[48]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Rocky Mountain National Park has a Subarctic climate with cool summers and year around precipitation (*Dfc*). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at Bear Lake Ranger Station (9492 ft / 2893 m) is 5a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -15.2 °F (-26.2 °C), and 5a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -16.1 °F (-26.7 °C) at Beaver Meadows Visitor Center (7825 ft / 2385 m).[49]\n\n\nThe complex interactions of elevation, slope, exposure and regional-scale air masses determine the climate within the park,[50][51] which is noted for its extreme weather patterns.[51] A \"collision of air masses\" from several directions produces some of the key weather events in the region. When cold arctic air from the north meets warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico at the Front Range, \"intense, very wet snowfalls with total snow depth measured in the feet\" accumulate in the park.[50]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Bear Lake Ranger Station, Rocky Mountain National Park.

High country overnight trips require gear suitable for -35 °F or below.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wild roses (*Rosa acicularis*) bloom from montane to subalpine regions\nThe subalpine region does not begin to experience spring-like conditions until June. Wildflowers bloom from late June to early August.[51]\n\n\nBelow 9,400 feet (2,865 m), temperatures are often moderate, although nighttime temperatures are cool, as is typical of mountain weather.[51] Spring comes to the montane area by early May, when wildflowers begin to bloom. Spring weather is subject to unpredictable changes in temperature and precipitation, with potential for snow along trails through May.[51] In July and August, temperatures are generally in the 70s or 80s °F during the day, and as low as the 40s °F at night.[51] Lower elevations receive rain as most of their summer precipitation.[50]\n\n\nSudden dramatic changes in the weather may occur during the summer, typically due to afternoon thunderstorms that can cause as much as a 20 °F drop in temperature and windy conditions.[51]\n\n\n\n### Continental Divide[edit]\n\n\nThe park's climate is also affected by the Continental Divide, which runs northwest to southeast through the center of the park atop the high peaks. The Continental Divide creates two distinct climate patterns - one typical of the east side near Estes Park and the other associated with the Grand Lake area on the park's west side.[51] The west side of the park experiences more snow, less wind, and clear cold days during the winter months.[51]\n\n\n\n### Climate change study[edit]\n\n\nRocky Mountain National Park was selected to participate in a climate change study, along with two other National Park Service areas in the Rocky Mountain region and three in the Appalachian Mountain region.[53] The study began in 2011, orchestrated by members of the academic scientific community in cooperation with the National Park Service and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).[53] The stated objective: \"develop and apply decision support tools that use NASA and other data and models to assess vulnerability of ecosystems and species to climate and land use change and evaluate management options.\"[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)Trees killed by mountain pine beetles.\nAs of 2010[update], the preceding one hundred years of records indicated an increase in the average annual temperature of approximately 3 °F (1.7 °C).[50][55][a] The average low temperature has increased more than the average high temperature during the same time period.[50] As a result of the temperature increase, snow is melting from the mountains earlier in the year, leading to drier summers and probably to an earlier, longer fire season.[50] Since the 1990s, mountain pine beetles have reproduced more rapidly and have not died off at their previous mortality rate during the winter months. Consequently, the increased beetle population has led to an increased rate of tree mortality in the park.[56]\n\n\nThe climate change study projects further temperature increases, with greater warming in the summer and higher extreme temperatures by 2050. Due to the increased temperature, there is a projected moderate increase in the rate of water evaporation. Reduced snowfall—perhaps 15% to 30% less than current amounts—and the elimination of surface hail, along with the higher likelihood of intense precipitation events are predicted by 2050. Droughts may be more likely due to increased temperatures, increased evaporation rates, and potential changes in precipitation.[56]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geology of the Rocky Mountains and Prehistory of Colorado\n\nPrecambrian metamorphic rock formed the core of the North American continent during the Precambrian eon 4.5–1 billion years ago. During the Paleozoic era, western North America was submerged beneath a shallow sea, with a seabed composed of limestone and dolomite deposits many kilometers thick.[57] Pikes Peak granite formed during the late Precambrian eon, continuing well into the Paleozoic era, when mass quantities of molten rock flowed, amalgamated, and formed the continents about 1 billion–300 million years ago. Concurrently, in the period from 500 to 300 million years ago, the region began to sink while lime and mud sediments were deposited in the vacated space. Eroded granite produced sand particles that formed strata—layers of sediment—in the sinking basin.[58]: 1\n\n\nAbout 300 million years ago, the land was uplifted creating the ancestral Rocky Mountains.[58]: 1 Fountain Formation was deposited during the Pennsylvanian period of the Paleozoic era, 290–296 million years ago. Over the next 150 million years, the mountains uplifted, continued to erode, and covered themselves in their own sediment. Wind, gravity, rainwater, snow, and glacial ice eroded the granite mountains over geologic time scales.[58]: 6 The Ancestral Rockies were eventually buried under subsequent strata.[58]: 10\n\n\n\n![](image)The Western Interior Seaway 95 million years ago.\nThe Pierre Shale formation was deposited during the Paleogene and Cretaceous periods about 70 million years ago. The region was covered by a deep sea—the Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway—which deposited massive amounts of shale on the seabed. Both the thick stratum of shale and embedded marine life fossils—including ammonites and skeletons of fish and such marine reptiles as mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and extinct species of sea turtles, along with rare dinosaur and bird remains—were created during this time period. The area now known as Colorado was eventually transformed from being at the bottom of an ocean to dry land again, giving yield to another fossiliferous rock layer known as the Denver Formation.[58]: 16\n\n\nAt about 68 million years ago, the Front Range began to rise again due to the Laramide orogeny in the west.[58]: 16,[59]: 8 During the Cenozoic era, block uplift formed the present Rocky Mountains. The geologic composition of Rocky Mountain National Park was also affected by deformation and erosion during that era. The uplift disrupted the older drainage patterns and created the present drainage patterns.[59]: 8–9\n\n\n\n### Glaciation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Andrews Glacier\nGlacial geology in Rocky Mountain National Park can be seen from the mountain peaks to the valley floors. Ice is a powerful sculptor of this natural environment and large masses of moving ice are the most powerful tools. Telltale marks of giant glaciers can be seen all throughout the park. Streams and glaciations during the Quaternary period cut through the older sediment, creating mesa tops and alluvial plains, and revealing the present Rocky Mountains.[58]: 30 The glaciation removed as much as 5,000 feet (1,500 m) of sedimentary rocks from earlier inland sea deposits. This erosion exposed the basement rock of the Ancestral Rockies. Evidence of the uplifting and erosion can be found on the way to Rocky Mountain National Park in the hogbacks of the Front Range foothills.[59]: 8–9 Many sedimentary rocks from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras exist in the basins surrounding the park.[60]\n\n\nWhile the glaciation periods are largely in the past, the park still has several small glaciers.[61] The glaciers include Andrews, Sprague, Tyndall, Taylor, Rowe, Mills, and Moomaw Glaciers.[35]\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ecology of the Rocky Mountains\n\n![](image)Clickable examples of ecosystem elements\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Rocky Mountain National Park encompasses three classifications; an Alpine tundra & Barren (*52*) vegetation type with an Alpine tundra (*11*) vegetation form, a Western Spruce/Fir (*15*) vegetation type with a Rocky Mountain Conifer Forest (*3*) vegetation form, and a Pine/Douglas fir (*18*) vegetation type with a Rocky Mountain Conifer Forest (*3*) vegetation form.[62]\n\n\nColorado has one of the most diverse plant and animal environments of the United States, partially due to the dramatic temperature differences arising from varying elevation levels and topography. In dry climates, the average temperature drops 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit with every 1,000 foot increase in elevation (9.8 degrees Celsius per 1,000 meters). Most of Colorado is semi-arid with the mountains receiving the greatest amount of precipitation in the state.[63]\n\n\nThe Continental Divide runs north to south through the park, creating a climatic division. Ancient glaciers carved the topography into a range of ecological zones.[31] The east side of the Divide tends to be drier with heavily glaciated peaks and cirques. The west side of the park is wetter with more lush, deep forests.[64]\n\n\nThere are four ecosystems, or zones, in Rocky Mountain National Park: montane, subalpine, alpine tundra, and riparian. The riparian zone occurs throughout all of the three other zones. Each individual ecosystem is composed of organisms interacting with one other and with their surrounding environment. Living organisms (biotic), along with the dead organic matter they produce, and the abiotic (non-living) environment that impacts those living organisms (water, weather, rocks, and landscape) are all members of an ecosystem.[65]\n\n\nThe park was designated a World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations in 1976 to protect its natural resources.[66][67] The park's biodiversity includes afforestation and reforestation, ecology, inland bodies of water, and mammals, while its ecosystems are managed for nature conservation, environmental education and public recreation purposes.[66] The areas of research and monitoring include ungulate ecology and management, high-altitude revegetation, global change, acid precipitation effects, and aquatic ecology and management.[66]\n\n\nFor a checklist of plants with photographic images) in the Rocky Mountain National Park, see Checklist RMNP.\n\n\n\n### Montane zone[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View from the Fall River Road illustrating the montane ecosystem with forested slopes and grassland in between\nThe montane ecosystem is at the lowest elevations in the park, between 5,600 to 9,500 feet (1,700 to 2,900 m), where the slopes and large meadow valleys support the widest range of plant and animal life,[68][69] including montane forests, grasslands, and shrublands. The area has meandering rivers[69] and during the summer, wildflowers grow in the open meadows. Ponderosa pine trees, grass, shrubs and herbs live on dry, south-facing slopes. North-facing slopes retain moisture better than those that face south. The soil better supports dense populations of trees, like Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, and ponderosa pine. There are also occasional Engelmann spruce and blue spruce trees. Quaking aspens thrive in high-moisture montane soils. Other water-loving small trees like willows, grey alder, and water birch may be found along streams or lakeshores. Water-logged soil in flat montane valleys may be unable to support growth of evergreen forests.[69] The following areas are part of the montane ecosystem: Moraine Park, Horseshoe Park, Kawuneeche Valley, and Upper Beaver Meadows.[69]\n\n\nSome of the mammals that inhabit the montane ecosystem include snowshoe hares, coyotes, cougars, beavers, mule deer, moose, bighorn sheep, black bears, and Rocky Mountain elk.[69] During the fall, visitors often flock to the park to witness the elk rut.[70]\n\n\n\n### Subalpine zone[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rocky Mountains subalpine zone\n\nFrom 9,000 ft (2,700 m) to 11,000 ft (3,400 m),[71] the montane forests give way to subalpine forests.[68] Forests of fir and Engelmann spruce cover the mountainsides in subalpine areas. Trees grow straight and tall in the lower subalpine forests, but become shorter and more deformed the nearer they are to the tree line.[71] At the tree line, seedlings may germinate on the lee side of rocks and grow only as high as the rock provides wind protection, with any further growth being more horizontal than vertical. The low growth of dense trees is called krummholz, which may become well-established and live for several hundred to a thousand years old.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Odessa Lake in the subalpine ecosystem\nIn the subalpine zone, lodgepole pines and huckleberry have established themselves in previous burn areas. Crystal clear lakes and fields of wildflowers are hidden among the trees. Mammals of the subalpine zone include bobcats, cougars, coyotes, elk, mule deer, chipmunks, shrews, porcupines and yellow-bellied marmots. Black bears are attracted by the berries and seeds of subalpine forests. Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, mountain chickadee and yellow-rumped warbler are some of the many birds found in the subalpine zone.[71] Sprague Lake and Odessa Lake are two of the park's subalpine lakes.[71]\n\n\n\n### Alpine tundra[edit]\n\n\nAbove tree line, at approximately 11,000 ft (3,400 m), trees disappear and the vast alpine tundra takes over.[68] Over one third of the park resides above the tree line, an area which limits plant growth due to the cold climate and strong winds. The few plants that can survive under such extreme conditions are mostly perennials. Many alpine plants are dwarfed at high elevations, though their occasional blossoms may be full-sized.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)View on Tundra Communities Trail\nCushion plants have long taproots that extend deep into the rocky soil. Their diminutive size, like clumps of moss, limits the effect of harsh winds. Many flowering plants of the tundra have dense hairs on stems and leaves to provide wind protection or red-colored pigments capable of converting the sun's light rays into heat. Some plants take two or more years to form flower buds, which survive the winter below the surface and then open and produce fruit with seeds in the few weeks of summer. Grasses and sedges are common where tundra soil is well-developed.[72]\n\n\nNon-flowering lichens cling to rocks and soil. Their enclosed algal cells can photosynthesize at any temperature above 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 °C), and the outer fungal layers can absorb more than their own weight in water. Adaptations for survival amidst drying winds and cold temperatures may make tundra vegetation seem very hardy, but in some respects it remains very fragile. Footsteps can destroy tundra plants and it may take hundreds of years to recover.[72] Mammals that live on the alpine tundra, or visit during the summer season, include bighorn sheep, elk, badgers, pikas, yellow-bellied marmots, and snowshoe hares. Birds include prairie falcons, white-tailed ptarmigans, and common ravens. Flowering plants include mertensia, sky pilot, alpine sunflowers, alpine dwarf columbine, and alpine forget-me-not. Grasses include kobresia, spike trisetum, spreading wheatgrass, and tufted hairgrass.[72]\n\n\n\n### Riparian zone[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mountain stream along Fall River Road is an example of a riparian ecosystem.\nThe riparian ecosystem runs through the montane, subalpine, and alpine tundra zones and creates a foundation for life, especially for species that thrive next to streams, rivers, and lakes.[73] The headwaters of the Colorado River, which provides water to many of the southwestern states, are located on the west side of the park. The Fall River, Cache la Poudre River and Big Thompson Rivers are located on the east side of the park. Just like the other ecosystems in the park, the riparian zone is affected by the climatic variables of temperature, precipitation, and elevation. Generally, riparian zones in valleys will have cooler temperatures than communities located on slopes and ridge tops. Depending on elevation, a riparian zone may have more or less precipitation than other riparian zones in the park, with the difference creating a shift in the types of plants and animals found in a specific zone.[74]\n\n\n\n### Wildlife[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mammals of Rocky Mountain National Park\n\nRocky Mountain National Park is home to many species of animals, including nearly seventy mammals and almost three hundred species of birds. This diversity is due to the park's varying topography, which creates a variety of habitats. However, some species have been extirpated from the park, including gray wolf, wolverine, grizzly bear, and American bison. Moose are commonly seen in the park, but they were not historically recorded as being part of this particular area of the Rocky Mountains.[75]\n\n\n\n#### Elk[edit]\n\n\nThe park is home to some 2,000 to 3,000 elk in summer, and between 800 and 1,000 elk spend the winter within its boundaries. Because of lack of predators such as wolves, the National Park Service culls around 50 elk each winter.[76] Overgrazing by elk has become a major problem in the park's riparian areas, so much so that the NPS fences them out of many critical wetland habitats to let willows and aspens grow. The program seems to be working, as the deciduous wetland plants thrive within the fencing. Many people think the elk herd is too large, but are reluctant to reintroduce predators because of its proximity to large human populations and ranches.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Other ungulates[edit]\n\n\nMany other ungulates reside in the park, including bighorn sheep, moose, and mule deer. Bison were eliminated from the park in the 1800s, as were pronghorn and moose, the latter of which was restored to the area in 1978. Moose are now frequently seen in the park, especially on the park's west side.[78] The park's bighorn sheep population has recovered and is estimated at 350 animals.[79]\n\n\n\n#### Predators[edit]\n\n\nThe park is home to many predatory animals, including Canada lynx, foxes, bobcat, cougar, black bear, and coyotes. Wolves and grizzly bears were extirpated in the early 1900s. Most of these predators kill smaller animals, but mountain lions and coyotes kill deer and occasionally elk. Bears also eat larger prey. Moose have no predators in the park. Black bears are relatively uncommon in the park, numbering only 24-35 animals. They also have fewer cubs and the bears seem skinnier than they do in most areas.[80] Canadian lynx are quite rare within the park, and they have probably spread north from the San Juan Mountains, where they were reintroduced in 1999. Cougars feed mainly on mule deer in the park, and live 10–13 years. Cougar territories can be as large as 500 square miles (1,300 km2).[81] Coyotes hunt both alone and in pairs, but occasionally hunt in packs. They mainly feed on rodents but occasionally bring down larger animals, including deer, and especially fawns and elk calves. Scat studies in Moraine Park showed that their primary foods were deer and rodents. They form strong family bonds and are very vocal.[82]\n\n\n\n## Recreational activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Longs Peak seen from Dream Lake trail\nThe park contains a network of trails that range from easy, paved paths suitable for all visitors including those with disabilities, to strenuous mountain trails for experienced, conditioned hikers as well as off-trail routes for backcountry hikes. Trails lead to more than 100 designated wilderness camping sites.[83] From either the Bear Lake or Grand Lake trailheads, backpackers can hike a 45 mi (72 km) loop along the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail within the park.[84] Most trails are for summer use only, since at other times of the year many trails are not safe due to weather conditions.[85] Horseback riding is permitted on most trails,[86] as are llamas and other pack animals.[87]\n\n\nRock climbing and mountaineering opportunities include Lumpy Ridge,[88] Hallett Peak, Chiefs Head Peak, and Longs Peak, the highest peak in the park, with the easiest route being the Keyhole Route. This 8 mi (13 km) one-way climb has an elevation gain of 4,850 ft (1,480 m). The vast east face, including the area known as The Diamond, is home to many classic big wall rock climbing routes. Many of the highest peaks have technical ice and rock routes on them, ranging from short scrambles to long multi-pitch climbs.[89] Bouldering is popular in the park as well, as it is often considered a \"mecca for boulderers around the world\", particularly the Emerald Lake and Chaos Canyon areas.[90]\n\n\nFishing is permitted at many of the park's lakes and streams. Four trout species inhabit park waters: rainbow, brook, cutthroat, and German brown trout.[86] The greenback cutthroat, once widespread in Eastern Colorado, is currently listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n\nDuring the winter most of Trail Ridge Road is closed due to heavy snow, limiting motorized access to the edges of the park.[67] Winter activities include snowshoeing and cross-country skiing which are possible from either the Estes Park or Grand Lake entrances. On the east side near Estes Park, skiing and snowshoeing trails are available off Bear Lake Road, such as the Bear Lake, Bierstadt Lake, and Sprague Lake trails and at Hidden Valley. Slopes for sledding are also available at Hidden Valley. The west side of the park near Grand Lake also has viable snowshoeing trails.[67][91] Backcountry skiing and snowboarding can be enjoyed after climbing up one of the higher slopes, especially late in the snow season after avalanche danger has subsided[92] and technical climbing remains also a possibility, although typically differing in style from the summer months.[93]\n\n\n\n## Hazards[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Hazards of outdoor recreation and Mountaineering § Hazards\n\nEncountering bears is a concern in much of the Rocky Mountains, including the Wind River Range.[94] There are other concerns as well, including bugs, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures.[95]\n\n\nThere have been notable incidents, including accidental deaths, due to falls from steep cliffs (a misstep could be fatal in this class 4/5 terrain) and due to falling rocks, over the years, including 1993,[96] 2007 (involving an experienced NOLS leader),[97] 2015[98] and 2018.[99] Other incidents include a seriously injured backpacker being airlifted near SquareTop Mountain[100] in 2005,[101] and a fatal hiker incident (from an apparent accidental fall) in 2006 that involved state search and rescue.[102] The U.S. Forest Service does not offer updated aggregated records on the official number of fatalities in such areas, including the Wind River Range.\n\n\n\n### Wildfires[edit]\n\n\nWildfires have been recorded in Rocky Mountain National Park prior to its establishment in 1915. Some of the most notable wildfires include the Bear Lake Fire, which was started by a campfire that was failed to be properly put out, and burned for two months in 1900. The Ouzel Fire in 1978 was caused naturally by lightning and was allowed to burn under supervision until it grew out of control and in total burned 1,050 acres of land. The Fern Lake Fire in 2012 was also caused by a campfire, the fire was intensified due to strong winds and drought in the area. Absence of fire in around Fern Lake for many centuries caused excessive dead trees and a thick layer of organic matter on the ground which fuelled the fire, ultimately leading to the it lasting for over two months, burning nearly 3,500 acres of land.[103]\n\n\nAn increase in average temperature in the Rocky Mountain region has been correlated to a decrease in snowfall that melts earlier in the year, attributing to drier summers and longer fire seasons. Rocky Mountain National Park is expected to see one of the largest increases in number of wildfires for the United States, with an increase in both duration and intensity for wildfires in general across the nation.[104][105]\n\n\nWildfires that have a higher burn severity can cause serious damage to an ecosystem. High-severity wildfires can cause soil degradation by affecting the soils’ ability to absorb and process water. They also cause an increase in erosion due to burning away vegetation that holds the soil to the ground, thus increasing the chances of flooding and mudslides that cause further damage in and around the affected areas. Ash from the fires also contributes significantly to air and water pollution.[106][107]\n\n\nLow-severity wildfires however are crucial to maintaining a balanced ecosystem and can help prevent the damaging high-severity wildfires by clearing away excess organic material that adds fuel to and amplifies the spread of more severe wildfires. While severe fires can negatively impact the soil, less severe wildfires can be beneficial as burning the nutrient-rich dead organic material helps to fertilize the soil. The smaller fires also clear room for new growth and can fight against invasive species encroachment in the park.[105][108]\n\n\nMany parks including Rocky Mountain National Park use small fires as means to prevent more severe fires from getting out of hand. Along with small, prescribed burns, other fuel management practices include removing low hanging branches and forest thinning in general. Scientists have been working hard to find a balance in wildfires, allowing them to work as a restorative ecological process while avoiding the damage and pollution that come with high-severity wildfires.[105]\n\n\n\n## Access[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Trail Ridge Road is the highest continuously paved highway in the United States.\nThe park may be accessed through Estes Park or via the western entrance at Grand Lake. Trail Ridge Road, also known as U.S. Route 34, connects the eastern and western sides of the park.[109] The park has a total of five visitor centers. The Alpine Visitor Center is located in the tundra environment along Trail Ridge Road, while Beaver Meadows and Fall River are both near Estes Park, with Kawuneeche in the Grand Lake area, and the Moraine Park Discovery Center near the Beaver Meadows entrance and visitor center.[11]\n\n\n\n### Trail Ridge Road and other roads[edit]\n\n\nTrail Ridge Road is 48 miles (77 km) long and connects the entrances in Grand Lake and Estes Park.[110][111] Running generally east–west through many hairpin turns,[6] the road crosses Milner Pass through the Continental Divide[111] at an elevation of 10,758 ft (3,279 m).[110][112] The highest point of the road is 12,183 feet (3,713 m),[111] with eleven miles of the road being above tree line which is approximately 11,500 feet (3,505 m).[110] The road is the highest continuously paved highway in the country,[111] and includes many large turnouts at key points to stop and observe the scenery.[110]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schematic map of Trail Ridge Road's northern sections\nMost visitors to the park drive over the famous Trail Ridge Road, but other roads include Fall River Road and Bear Lake Road.[113] The park is open every day of the year, weather permitting.[114] Due to the extended winter season in higher elevations, Trail Ridge Road between Many Parks Curve and the Colorado River Trailhead is closed much of the year. The road is usually open again by Memorial Day and closes in mid-October, generally after Columbus Day.[111] Fall River Road does not open until about July 4 and closes by, or in, October for vehicular traffic.[115] Snow may also fall in sufficient quantities in higher elevations to require temporary closure of the roads into July,[51][111] which is reported on the road status site.[113]\n\n\n\n### Estes Park[edit]\n\n\nMost visitors enter the park through the eastern entrances near Estes Park, which is about 71 miles (114 km) northwest of Denver.[109] The most direct route to Trail Ridge Road is the Beaver Meadows entrance, located just west of Estes Park on U.S. Route 36, which leads to the Beaver Meadows Visitor Center and the park's headquarters. North of the Beaver Meadows entrance station is the Fall River entrance, which also leads to Trail Ridge Road and Old Fall River Road.[109] There are three routes into Estes Park: I-25 to U.S. 34 west which runs alongside the Big Thompson River; U.S. 36 west (northwest) from Boulder connecting to U.S. 34 west; and the Peak to Peak Highway, also known as State Highway 7, from points south.[109]\n\n\nThe nearest airport is Denver International Airport[109] and the closest train station is the Denver Union Station. Estes Park may be reached by rental car or shuttle.[109][116] During peak tourist season, there is free shuttle service within the park; additionally, the town of Estes Park provides shuttle service to Estes Park Visitor Center, surrounding campgrounds, and the Rocky Mountain National Park's shuttles.[109]\n\n\n\n### Grand Lake[edit]\n\n\nVisitors may also enter at the western side of the park from U.S. 34 near Grand Lake. U.S. 34 is reached by taking U.S. 40 north from I-70.[109] The closest railroad station is the Amtrak station in Granby, which is 20 miles (32 km) from the western entrance of the park. Taxi service is available into the park.[116]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Environment portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n* ![](image)History portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![flag](image)Colorado portal\n\n\n* List of areas in the United States National Park System – parks, monuments, preserves, historic sites, etc.\n* Birds of Rocky Mountain National Park\n* List of national parks of the United States\n* Southern Rocky Mountain Front - where the Rocky Mountains meet the plains\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Montana State University states in their profile of Rocky Mountain National Park that there has been an increase of 2.5 °F (1.4 °C) in the average park temperature over \"the past century\" (charts show the period from about 1895 to 2010).[50] The National Park Service site states that the increase has been 3.4 °F (1.9 °C) over \"the last century\" (chart shows the period from about 1905-2010).[55]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rocky Mountain in United States of America Archived 2019-07-24 at the Wayback Machine. *protectedplanet.net*.
