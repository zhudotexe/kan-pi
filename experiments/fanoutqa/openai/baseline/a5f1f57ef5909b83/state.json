The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year, and is the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. The winner receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The contest is held in an American city, chosen three to four years beforehand,[1] usually at warm-weather sites or domed stadiums.[2] Since January 1971, the winner of the American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs.\n\n\nBefore the 1970 merger between the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL), the two leagues met in four such contests. The first two were marketed as the \"AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game\", but were also casually referred to as \"the Super Bowl game\" during the television broadcast.[3] Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the \"Super Bowl\" moniker in official marketing; the names \"Super Bowl I\" and \"Super Bowl II\" were retroactively applied to the first two games.[4]\n\n\nA total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl.[5] There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. \n\n\nThe 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII. Only two franchises have ever won the Super Bowl while hosting at their home stadiums: the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV and the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI.\n\n\n\n![List of Super Bowl

Several franchises have had eras of sustained success, nearly accomplishing a three-peat:\n\n\n\n* The Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, and also won the NFL Championship Game the preceding year. If the Super Bowl had been instituted that year, the Packers would have qualified and faced the Buffalo Bills of the AFL.\n* The Miami Dolphins appeared in three consecutive Super Bowls (VI, VII, and VIII)\u00a0\u2013 winning the last two, and coming within one win of three consecutive Super Bowl titles.\n* The Dallas Cowboys won two consecutive Super Bowls (XXVII and XXVIII); the following season they were eliminated in the NFC Championship Game, two wins short of a three-peat, by the eventual Super Bowl XXIX champion San Francisco 49ers. The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX the following year for three wins in four seasons, and thus were two wins away from four consecutive Super Bowl titles.\n* The Kansas City Chiefs made three Super Bowls in four years, winning LIV and LVII, while losing LV. In the intervening year, they lost the 2021 AFC Championship Game to the Cincinnati Bengals in overtime, coming one win short of four consecutive appearances. Additionally, in the year prior to their victory in LIV, the Chiefs likewise lost the 2018 AFC Championship Game to the New England Patriots in overtime, resulting in being two wins short of five consecutive appearances.\n* The New England Patriots won Super Bowls XLIX, LI, and LIII for three wins in five seasons. They also appeared in and lost Super Bowl LII to the Philadelphia Eagles following the 2017 season, giving them four Super Bowl appearances in five years and putting them one win away from three consecutive Super Bowl titles. Moreover, in the intervening year, were eliminated in the AFC Championship Game by the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver Broncos. In total, then, the Patriots were three wins away from five consecutive Super Bowl appearances.\n* The Pittsburgh Steelers won two consecutive Super Bowls (IX and X); the following season they were eliminated in the AFC Championship Game, two wins short of a three-peat, by the eventual Super Bowl XI champion Oakland Raiders. They also won two more consecutive Super Bowls (XIII and XIV) for four wins in six seasons.\n* The San Francisco 49ers won two consecutive Super Bowls (XXIII and XXIV); the following season they were eliminated in the NFC Championship Game, two wins short of a three-peat, by the eventual Super Bowl XXV champion New York Giants.\n\n\n### Consecutive losses[edit]\n\n\nThree franchises have lost consecutive Super Bowls:\n\n\n\n* Buffalo Bills (4) (Super Bowls XXV, XXVI, XXVII, and XXVIII) \u2013 The only team to appear in four straight Super Bowls; they lost in all four appearances.\n* Minnesota Vikings (2) (VIII and IX) \u2013 They also lost Super Bowl XI, and were knocked out of the 1975\u201376 playoffs by the eventual Super Bowl X losers, the Dallas Cowboys, for three losses in four seasons.\n* Denver Broncos (2) (XXI and XXII) \u2013 They also lost Super Bowl XXIV, but did not qualify for the 1988\u201389 playoffs for Super Bowl XXIII for three losses in four seasons.[n 1]\n\n\n### Consecutive appearances[edit]\n\n\nThe Buffalo Bills have the most consecutive appearances with four from 1990 to 1993. The Miami Dolphins (1971\u20131973) and New England Patriots (2016\u20132018) are the only other teams to have at least three consecutive appearances. All three teams with three or more consecutive Super Bowl appearances are in the AFC East division. Including those three, 11 teams have at least two consecutive appearances. The Dallas Cowboys are the only team with three separate streaks (1970\u20131971, 1977\u20131978, and 1992\u20131993). The Green Bay Packers, Pittsburgh Steelers, Denver Broncos,[n 1] and New England Patriots have each had two separate consecutive appearances. The Kansas City Chiefs are the most recent team to appear in consecutive Super Bowls playing in Super Bowl LIV and Super Bowl LV. The full listing of teams with consecutive appearances is below in order of first occurrence; winning games are in **bold**:\n\n\n\n* Green Bay Packers (twice: Super Bowls **I** and **II**; **XXXI** and XXXII)\n* Dallas Cowboys (thrice: V and **VI**;

In 1977, the two teams switched conferences, placing the Seahawks in the AFC and the Buccaneers in the NFC. In 2002, the Seahawks returned to the NFC. Neither the Seahawks nor Buccaneers have played in the Super Bowl representing the AFC.\n\n![](image)The New England Patriots played their first championship game in Super Bowl XX (*pictured*) where they lost to the Bears. This is the most recent Super Bowl where both teams had their first Super Bowl appearance. The Patriots hold the record for most Super Bowl appearances (11) and are tied for both most wins (6, tied with the Steelers) and most losses (5, tied with the Broncos).\n### Teams with no Super Bowl appearances or long active droughts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Jets' last championship appearance was their victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III.\nFour current teams have never reached the Super Bowl (shown in **bold** below). Two of them (Jacksonville and Houston) joined the NFL relatively recently, and there are an additional eight teams whose Super Bowl appearance droughts began prior to 2002 (the year Houston joined the NFL). The other two teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl (Cleveland and Detroit) both held NFL league championships prior to Super Bowl I in the 1966 NFL season[n 7]. Teams are listed below according to the length of their current Super Bowl droughts:\n\n\n\n* **Cleveland Browns**, 57 years \u2013 NFL champions four times in 1950, 1954, 1955, and 1964; appeared in seven other NFL Championship Games in 1951, 1952, 1953, 1957, 1965, 1968, and 1969; and appeared in three AFC Championship Games in the 1986, 1987, and 1989 seasons.[83] The Browns are officially viewed as one continuous franchise that began in 1946 as a member of the All-America Football Conference, joined the NFL in 1950, suspended operations after 1995, and resumed play in 1999.[84][n 6]\n* **Detroit Lions**, 57 years \u2013 NFL champions four times in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957; appeared in one other NFL Championship Game in 1954; and appeared in one NFC Championship Game in the 1991 season.[85]\n* New York Jets, 54 years \u2013 Won Super Bowl III, 1968 season[86][n 8]\n* Minnesota Vikings, 46 years \u2013 Lost Super Bowl XI, 1976 season\n* Miami Dolphins, 38 years \u2013 Lost Super Bowl XIX, 1984 season\n* Washington Commanders, 31 years \u2013 Won Super Bowl XXVI, 1991 season (played as Washington Redskins)\n* Buffalo Bills, 29 years \u2013 Lost Super Bowl XXVIII, 1993 season\n* Los Angeles Chargers, 28 years \u2013 Lost Super Bowl XXIX, 1994 season (played as San Diego Chargers)\n* **Jacksonville Jaguars**, 27 years \u2013 1995 expansion team; AFC Championship Game appearances in the 1996, 1999, and 2017 seasons.[87]\n* Dallas Cowboys, 27 years \u2013 Won Super Bowl XXX, 1995 season\n* Tennessee Titans, 23 years \u2013 Lost Super Bowl XXXIV, 1999 season\n* **Houston Texans**, 20 years \u2013 2002 expansion team; Divisional Round appearances in the 2011, 2012, 2016, and 2019 seasons. They are the only NFL team to never reach the Conference Championship Round.\n\n\n### Teams with Super Bowl appearances but no victories[edit]\n\n\nEight teams have appeared in the Super Bowl without ever winning. In descending order of number of appearances and then years since their last appearance, they are:\n\n\n\n* Minnesota Vikings (4) \u2013 appeared in Super Bowls IV, VIII, IX, and XI; they won the NFL Championship in 1969, the last year before the AFL\u2013NFL merger, but failed to win the subsequent Super Bowl. An NFL expansion team in 1961, they have no pre-Super Bowl league championships.\n* Buffalo Bills (4) \u2013 XXV, XXVI, XXVII, and XXVIII; in 1964 and 1965, they won the last two AFL Championships before the first Super Bowl in 1966.\n* Cincinnati Bengals (3) \u2013 XVI, XXIII, and LVI; an AFL expansion team in 1968, they have no pre-Super Bowl league championships.\n* Carolina Panthers (2) \u2013 XXXVIII and 50; a post-merger expansion team, their first season was in 1995.\n* Atlanta Falcons (2) \u2013 XXXIII and LI; an NFL expansion team in 1966, they have no pre-Super Bowl league championships.\n* Los Angeles Chargers (1) \u2013 XXIX as the San Diego Chargers; their only AFL Championship was in 1963, also as the San Diego Chargers.\n* Tennessee Titans (1) \u2013 XXXIV; they won the first two AFL Championships in 1960 and 1961 as the Houston Oilers.\n* Arizona Cardinals (1) \u2013 XLIII; their only uncontested NFL Championship was in 1947 as the Chicago Cardinals.

For the same reason, it is the only Super Bowl rematch that is capable of being played in the postseason outside of the Super Bowl.\n3. **^** The Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills are the only NFL teams to face each other in consecutive Super Bowls, XXVII and XXVIII.\n4. **^** This is the only rematch pairing in which one team has relocated in the interim.
