K. Rowling. The first novel in the *Harry Potter* series and Rowling's debut novel, it follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school and with the help of his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, he faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.\n\n\nThe book was first published in the United Kingdom on 26 June 1997 by Bloomsbury. It was published in the United States the following year by Scholastic Corporation under the title ***Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone***. It won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the *New York Times* list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least 73 other languages and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of its sequels. The novel has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making it the fourth best-selling book of all time.[1][2]\n\n\nMost reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors; Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as overcoming obstacles like bullying.\n\n\nThe *Harry Potter* series has been used as a source of object lessons in educational techniques, sociological analysis and marketing.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nHarry Potter lives with his abusive uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and their bullying son, Dudley. On Harry's eleventh birthday, Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant, delivers an acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, revealing that Harry's parents, James and Lily Potter, were wizards. When Harry was just a year old, a powerful but malevolent dark wizard named Lord Voldemort murdered his parents; Harry survived Voldemort's killing curse that rebounded and seemingly destroyed the Dark Lord, leaving a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. Unknown to Harry, this act made him famous in the wizarding world.\n\n\nHagrid escorts Harry to Diagon Alley, the hidden wizard commerce and retail section in London. Harry's parents have left him a fortune kept in Gringotts Wizarding Bank, which he uses to buy school supplies and a wand from Ollivander's. The cores of Harry and Lord Voldemort's wands have feathers from the same phoenix bird, making them \"brothers\". Hagrid gifts Harry an owl, whom he names as Hedwig, as a birthday present. A month later, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross railway station's secret Platform 9+3⁄4. En route to Hogwarts, Harry befriends fellow first year Ron Weasley and meets Hermione Granger, whom the two boys initially dislike.\n\n\nHarry runs afoul of Draco Malfoy, the spoiled son of a prominent wizard. At Hogwarts, a magical Sorting Hat sorts the first years among four school Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin) that best suit their personalities and talents. Draco joins Slytherin, known for producing dark wizards, while Harry, Ron, and Hermione are sorted into Gryffindor.\n\n\nHarry's broomstick flying ability earns him a place on the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the Seeker. Harry comes to dislike Potions master Severus Snape, who favours Slytherin while seeking to fail Harry. Malfoy tricks Harry and Ron into risking expulsion by leaving their common room after curfew. Hermione, unable to stop them, tags along. Realising Malfoy's ruse, they hide in a forbidden corridor and discover a gigantic three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. Harry and Ron later save Hermione from a troll during a Halloween celebration and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury and suspicious behaviour, Harry, Ron, and Hermione believe he is attempting to enter the trapdoor.\n\n\nDuring Harry's first Quidditch match, his broomstick attempts to buck him off. Snape's strange behaviour during the match convinces Hermione he jinxed Harry's broom. Harry receives an anonymous Christmas gift – his father's invisibility cloak. Using it to explore the school, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows what the viewer most desires. Harry sees his parents.\n\n\nA newspaper report later describes an attempted robbery at the same vault in Gringotts from which Hagrid retrieved an item for Hogwarts' headmaster Albus Dumbledore on the same day. The object beneath the trapdoor is the philosopher's stone, which grants its user immortality and the ability to turn any metal into pure gold. Firenze, a forest centaur, warns Harry that Voldemort is plotting to steal the stone to restore his body. When Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione, and Ron fear the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor.\n\n\nVarious obstacles force Ron and Hermione to remain behind while Harry proceeds. Harry encounters Professor Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He jinxed Harry's broom and let the troll into the school; Snape was protecting Harry. Voldemort, whose face has regrown on the back of Quirrell's head, is revealed to be the professor's secret master. Harry is forced to stand before the Mirror of Erised. It recognises Harry's lack of greed for the stone and deposits it into his pocket. Quirrell attempts to seize the stone, but his flesh burns upon contact with Harry. Harry's scar begins hurting, and he passes out.\n\n\nHarry awakens in the school's infirmary. He survived Voldemort because his mother sacrificing her life for him left a magical protective charm. Quirrell's hatred and greed caused him to burn upon contact with Harry; Voldemort abandoned him to die. Dumbledore reveals he sent Harry the invisibility cloak, while the philosopher's stone, that had been keeping the long-lived Nicolas Flamel alive, has been destroyed with Flamel's consent to prevent its being stolen. During the school's year-end feast, Gryffindor is awarded the House Cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys at Privet Drive until the next school year.\n\n\n\n## Characters[edit]\n\n\n* Harry Potter is an orphan whom Rowling imagined as a \"scrawny, black-haired, green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard.\"[3] She developed the series' story and characters to explain how Harry came to be in this situation and how his life unfolded from there.[4] Apart from the first chapter, the events of this book take place just before and in the year following Harry's eleventh birthday. Voldemort's attack left a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead,[4] which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort is present. Harry has a natural talent for Quidditch and became the first person in a century to get on their team in their first year.\n* Ron Weasley is Harry's age, and Rowling describes him as the ultimate best friend \"always there when you need him\".[5] He is freckled, red-haired, and quite tall. He grew up in a fairly large pure-blood family as the sixth born of seven children. Although his family is quite poor, they still live comfortably and happily. His loyalty and bravery in the face of a game of Wizards Chess plays a vital part in finding the Philosopher's Stone.\n* Hermione Granger, the daughter of an all-Muggle family, is a bossy girl who has apparently memorised most of the textbooks before the start of term. Rowling described Hermione as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character with \"a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness\".[6] Despite her nagging efforts to keep Harry and Ron out of trouble, she becomes a close friend of the two boys after they save her from a troll and her magical and analytical skills play an important role in finding the Philosopher's Stone. She has bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth.\n* Neville Longbottom is a plump, diffident boy, so forgetful that his grandmother gives him a Remembrall, to remind him if he forgets something. Neville's magical abilities are weak and appeared just in time to save his life when he was eight. Despite his timidity, Neville will fight anyone after some encouragement or if he thinks it is right and important.\n* Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant nearly 12 feet (3.7 m) tall, with tangled black hair and beard, was expelled from Hogwarts and his wand was snapped in half (resulting in him never to use a wand again), however Professor Dumbledore let him stay on as the school's gamekeeper, a job which enables him to give lavish affection, care and even pet names (such as Norbert the dragon) on even the most dangerous of magical creatures. Hagrid is fiercely loyal to Dumbledore and quickly becomes a close friend of Harry, Ron and, later, Hermione, but his carelessness makes him unreliable.\n* Professor Albus Dumbledore, a tall, thin man who wears half-moon spectacles and has silver hair and a beard that tucks into his belt, is the headmaster of Hogwarts, and thought to be the only wizard Voldemort fears. Dumbledore, while renowned for his achievements in magic, shrugs off praise, though he is aware of his own brilliance. Rowling described him as the \"epitome of goodness\".[7]\n* Professor Minerva McGonagall, a tall, severe-looking woman with black hair tied in a tight bun, teaches Transfiguration and is able to transform herself into a cat. She is Deputy Headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House.\n* Petunia Dursley, the sister of Harry's mother Lily, is a thin woman with a long neck that she uses for spying on the neighbours. As a Muggle, she regards her magical sister as a freak and tries to pretend that she never existed.\n* Vernon Dursley, the husband of Petunia Dursley, is a heavily built man whose irascible bluster covers a narrow mind and a fear of anything unusual.\n* Dudley Dursley is an overweight, spoilt bully and Harry's cousin.\n* Draco Malfoy is a slim, pale boy who speaks in a bored drawl. He is arrogant about his skill in Quidditch, and despises anyone who is not a pure-blood wizard  and wizards who do not share his views. His parents had supported Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard's disappearance, claiming they had been bewitched. Draco avoids direct confrontations and tries to get Harry and his friends into trouble.\n* Oliver Wood is Harry's Quidditch captain and keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.\n* Professor Quirrell is a twitching, stammering, and nervous man who teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts. Reputedly he was a brilliant scholar, but his nerve was shattered by an encounter with vampires. Quirrell wears a turban to conceal the fact that he is voluntarily possessed by Voldemort, whose face appears on the back of Quirrell's head.\n* Professor Severus Snape, who has a hooked nose, sallow complexion, and greasy black hair, teaches Potions, but would prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Snape favours pupils in Slytherin, his own House and seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is aiding Voldemort.\n* Argus Filch, the school caretaker who knows the school's secret passages better than anyone else except, perhaps, the Weasley twins. His cat, Mrs. Norris, aids his constant hunt for misbehaving pupils.\n\n\nOther members of staff include: the dumpy Herbology teacher and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick, the tiny and excitable Charms teacher and Head of Ravenclaw House, the soporific History of Magic teacher, Professor Binns, a ghost who does not seem to have noticed his own death, and Madam Hooch, the Quidditch coach, who is strict, but a considerate and methodical teacher. The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing trouble wherever he can.\n\n\nIn the book, Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters. The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero [Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined him as a \"scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard\"[3] and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him.[8] During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, \"always there when you need him\".[5] Rowling has described Hermione as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character with \"a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness\".[6]\n\n\nRowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind wizard Albus Dumbledore, who becomes Harry's confidant. Rowling described him as \"the epitome of goodness\".[7] His right hand is severe Minerva McGonagall, the friendly half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, who saved Harry from the Dursley family and the sinister Severus Snape. Professor Quirrell is also featured in the novel.\n\n\nThe main antagonists are Draco Malfoy, an elitist, bullying classmate,[9] and Lord Voldemort, the most powerful evil wizard who becomes disembodied when he tries to kill baby Harry. According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry and his backstory was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:\n\n\n\n\n> The basic idea... Harry, I saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And I knew he didn't know he was a wizard. ... And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. ... When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry—he tried to curse him. ... And—so—but for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since.[4]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Development, publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nThe book, which was Rowling's debut novel, was written between approximately June 1990 and some time in 1995. In 1990, Jo Rowling, as she preferred to be known,[a] wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words, \"One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head... A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy became more and more of a wizard to me... I began to write *Philosopher's Stone* that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product.\"[8] Then, Rowling's mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry.[8] Rowling spent six years working on *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels.[13] She sent the book to an literary agent and a publisher and then the second agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000 words. Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book[14] and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was \"so much better than anything else\".[15]\n\n\n\n### Publication and reception in the United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Imitation of the fictional Platform 9+3⁄4 at the real King's Cross railway station, with a luggage trolley apparently halfway through the magical wall\nBloomsbury accepted the book, paying Rowling a £2,500 advance[16] and Cunningham sent proof copies to carefully chosen authors, critics and booksellers in order to obtain comments that could be quoted when the book was launched.[14] He was less concerned about the book's length than about its author's name, since the title sounded like a boys' book to him and he believed boys preferred books by male authors. Rowling therefore adopted the pen name J. K. Rowling just before publication.[14]\n\n\nIn June 1997, Bloomsbury published *Philosopher's Stone* with an initial print run of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries.[17] Her original name, \"Joanne Rowling\", can be found on the copyright page of all British editions until September 1999. (The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to \"Joanne\" completely.)[18] The short initial print run was standard for first novels and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers.[14] Examples from this initial print run have sold for as much as US$471,000 in a 2021 Heritage auction.[19] Thomas Taylor created the cover for the first edition.[14]\n\n\nLindsey Fraser, who had previously supplied one of the blurb comments,[14] wrote what is thought to be the first published review, in *The Scotsman* on 28 June 1997. She described *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* as \"a hugely entertaining thriller\" and Rowling as \"a first-rate writer for children\".[14][20] Another early review, in *The Herald*, said: \"I have yet to find a child who can put it down.\" Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews in *The Guardian* and *The Sunday Times* and in September 1997 *Books for Keeps*, a magazine that specialised in children's books, gave the novel four stars out of five.[14] *Sunday Times* said:\"comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified\", while *The Guardian* called it \"a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit\" and *The Scotsman* said it had \"all the makings of a classic\".[14]\n\n\nIn 1997 the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9- to 11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize.[21] The *Smarties* award, which is voted for by children, made the book well known within six months of publication, while most children's books have to wait for years.[14] The following year, *Philosopher's Stone* won almost all the other major British awards that were decided by children.[14][b] It was also shortlisted for children's books awards adjudicated by adults,[22] but did not win. Sandra Beckett commented that books that were popular with children were regarded as undemanding and as not of the highest literary standards – for example, the literary establishment disdained the works of Dahl, an overwhelming favourite of children before the appearance of Rowling's books.[23] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 22 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[24]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* won two publishing industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit, the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and the Booksellers' Association / *Bookseller* Author of the Year.[14] By March 1999 UK editions had sold just over 300,000 copies[25] and the story was still the UK's best-selling title in December 2001.[26] A Braille edition was published in May 1998 by the Scottish Braille Press.[27]\n\n\nPlatform 9+3⁄4, from which the Hogwarts Express left London, was commemorated in the real-life King's Cross railway station with a sign and a trolley apparently passing through the wall.[28]\n\n\n\n\n### US publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUK to American translation examples[29][30]\n| UK | American\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| mum, mam | mom\n |\n| sherbet lemon | lemon drop |\n| motorbike | motorcycle\n |\n| chips | fries\n |\n| crisp | chip\n |\n| jelly | Jell-O |\n| jacket potato | baked potato\n |\n| jumper | sweater\n |\n\n\nScholastic Corporation bought the US rights at the Bologna Book Fair in April 1997 for US$105,000, an unusually high sum for a children's book.[14] Scholastic's Arthur Levine thought that \"philosopher\" sounded too archaic for readers[31] and after some discussion (including the proposed title \"Harry Potter and the School of Magic\"[32]), the American edition was published in September 1998[33] under the title Rowling suggested, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.[14] Rowling later said that she regretted this change and would have fought it if she had been in a stronger position at the time.[10] Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy and the meaning of some other terms changed in translation, for example from \"crumpet\" to \"muffin\". While Rowling accepted the change from both the British English \"mum\" and Seamus Finnigan's Irish variant \"mam\" to the American variant \"mom\" in *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, she vetoed this change in the later books, which was then reversed in later editions of *Philosopher's Stone*. However, Nel considered that Scholastic's translations were considerably more sensitive than most of those imposed on British English books of the time and that some other changes could be regarded as useful copyedits.[29] Since the UK editions of early titles in the series were published months prior to the American versions, some American readers became familiar with the British English versions owing to having bought them from online retailers.[34]\n\n\nAt first the most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library publications such as *Kirkus Reviews* and *Booklist*, which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by *Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices*, which noted complexity, depth and consistency in the world that Rowling had built) attracted the attention of reviewers in major newspapers.[35] Although *The Boston Globe* and Michael Winerip in *The New York Times* complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book,[20][36] they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.[14][20]\nA year later, the US edition was selected as an American Library Association Notable Book, a *Publishers Weekly* Best Book of 1998 and a New York Public Library 1998 Best Book of the Year and won *Parenting Magazine*'s Book of the Year Award for 1998,[21] the *School Library Journal* Best Book of the Year and the American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults.[14] In 2012 it was ranked number 3 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by *School Library Journal*.[37]\n\n\nIn August 1999, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* topped the *New York Times* list of best-selling fiction[38] and stayed near the top of the list for much of 1999 and 2000, until the *New York Times* split its list into children's and adult sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher placings.[23][35] *Publishers Weekly*'s report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6 million copies).[39]\n\n\nIn May 2008, Scholastic announced the creation of a 10th Anniversary Edition of the book[40] that was released on 1 October 2008[41] to mark the tenth anniversary of the original American release.[40] For the fifteenth anniversary of the books, Scholastic re-released *Sorcerer's Stone*, along with the other six novels in the series, with new cover art by Kazu Kibuishi in 2013.[42][43][44]\n\n\n\n### Translations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter in translation\n\nBy mid-2008, official translations of the book had been published in 67 languages.[45][46] By November 2017, the book had been translated into 80 languages, the 80th being Lowland Scots.[47] Bloomsbury have published translations in Latin and in Ancient Greek,[48][49] with the latter being described as \"one of the most important pieces of Ancient Greek prose written in many centuries\".[50]\n\n\n\n## Style and themes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harry Potter influences and analogues\n\nPhilip Nel highlighted the influence of Jane Austen, whom Rowling has greatly admired since the age of twelve. Both novelists greatly encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line – for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the *Harry Potter* books is reminiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirise social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However, in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on caricature and the names she invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens's stories,[20]: 13–15 and Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature.[51] Rowling, like the Narnia series' author C. S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines literary genres‍—‌fantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, *Bildungsroman* and many others.[20]: 51–52\n\n\nSome reviewers compared *Philosopher's Stone* to the stories of Roald Dahl, who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of *Philosopher's Stone*, seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was an American, R. L. Stine. Some of the story elements in *Philosopher's Stone* resembled parts of Dahl's stories. For example, the hero of *James and the Giant Peach* lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts‍—‌one fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.[14]\n\n\nLibrarian Nancy Knapp and marketing professor Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as Diagon Alley.[21][52] Tad Brennan commented that Rowling's writing resembles that of Homer: \"rapid, plain, and direct in expression\".[50] Stephen King admired \"the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable\" and concluded that they worked because Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.[53]\n\n\nNicholas Tucker described the early *Harry Potter* books as looking back to Victorian and Edwardian children's stories: Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which they were associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Argus Filch's cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak.[54] Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society including many social stereotypes.[55] However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.[56]\n\n\nSusan Hall wrote that there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic officials are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.[57]\n\n\nNel suggested that the unflattering characterisation of the extremely conventional, status-conscious, materialistic Dursleys was Rowling's reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual couple as the \"preferred norm\", while the author was a single mother. Harry's relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty. This is reflected in his happiness whenever he is a temporary member of the Weasley family throughout the series, and in his treatment of first Rubeus Hagrid and later Remus Lupin and Sirius Black as father-figures.[20]: 13–15, 47–48[51]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Sequels[edit]\n\n\nThe second book, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and later, in the US on 2 June 1999.[58][59] *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was then published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999.[58][59] *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.[60] *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* is the longest book in the series at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version.[61] It was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003.[62] *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* was published on 16 July 2005 and sold 11 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release.[63][64] The seventh and final novel, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, was published on 21 July 2007.[65] The book sold 11 million copies within 24 hours of its release: 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.[66]\n\n\n\n### Illustrated version[edit]\n\n\nAn illustrated version of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* was released on 6 October 2015, with illustrations by Jim Kay.[67][68] The book carries over 100 illustrations and will be followed by illustrated versions of all seven books from the series by the same artist.\n\n\n\n### Podcast version[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2020, a reading podcast by Spotify was created and entitled *Harry Potter at Home: Readings*. Each chapter is narrated by a celebrity guest from the *Harry Potter* and *Wizarding World* franchises.[69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Chapter | Title | Release date | Runtime | Narrated by\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | *The Boy Who Lived* | 5 May 2020 | 25 mins, 54 secs | Daniel Radcliffe |\n| 2 | *The Vanishing Glass* | 8 May 2020 | 27 mins, 27 secs | Noma Dumezweni |\n| 3 | *The Letters from No One* | 12 May 2020 | 26 mins, 14 secs | Eddie Redmayne |\n| 4 | *The Keeper of the Keys* | 14 May 2020 | 26 mins, 54 secs | Stephen Fry |\n| 5 | *Diagon Alley* | 19 May 2020 | 48 mins, 1 sec | Simon Callow, Bonnie Wright and Evanna Lynch |\n| 6 | *The Journey from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters* | 20 May 2020 | 41 mins, 47 secs | Jamie Parker and cast of *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* |\n| 7 | *The Sorting Hat* | 27 May 2020 | 27 mins, 1 sec | Olivia Colman, Jonathan Van Ness and Kate McKinnon |\n| 8 | *The Potions Master* | 28 May 2020 | 18 mins, 36 secs | Alia Bhatt, Alec Baldwin and Carmen Baldwin\n |\n| 9 | *Midnight Duel* | 3 June 2020 | 33 mins, 21 secs | Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler |\n| 10 | *Hallowe'en* | 4 June 2020 | 29 mins, 06 secs | Whoopi Goldberg |\n| 11 | *Quidditch* | 10 June 2020 | 22 mins, 27 secs | David Tennant and David Beckham |\n| 12 | *The Mirror of Erised* | 3 July 2020 | 39 mins, 14 secs | Matthew Lewis, Helen Howard and Imelda Staunton |\n| 13 | *Nicolas Flamel* | 7 July 2020 | 22 mins, 2 secs | Hugh Bonneville |\n| 14 | *Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback* | 8 July 2020 | 26 mins, 6 secs | Jason Isaacs, Tom Felton and Helen McCrory |\n| 15 | *The Forbidden Forest* | 13 July 2020 | 33 mins, 3 secs | Claudia Kim and Dakota Fanning |\n| 16 | *Through the Trapdoor* | 14 July 2020 | 51 mins, 35 secs | Kenneth Branagh, Ruth Wilson and Helena Bonham Carter |\n| 17 | *The Man with the Two Faces* | 16 July 2020 | 41 mins, 29 secs | Three families of *Harry Potter* fans, with a surprise appearance from J. K.

Writing about clinical teaching in medical schools, Jennifer Conn contrasted Snape's technical expertise with his intimidating behaviour towards students. Quidditch coach Madam Hooch on the other hand, illustrated useful techniques in the teaching of physical skills, including breaking down complex actions into sequences of simple ones and helping students to avoid common errors.[93] Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class: \"sociological concepts including culture, society, and socialisation; stratification and social inequality; social institutions; and social theory\".[55]\n\n\nStephen Brown noted that the early *Harry Potter* books, especially *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, were a runaway success despite inadequate and poorly organised marketing. Brown advised marketing executives to be less preoccupied with rigorous statistical analyses and the \"analysis, planning, implementation, and control\" model of management. Instead he recommended that they should treat the stories as \"a marketing masterclass\", full of enticing products and brand names.[52] For example, a real-world analogue of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans was introduced under licence in 2000 by toymaker Hasbro.[52][94]\n\n\n\n## Release history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Release date\n | Edition(Hardback/Paperback) | Publisher\n | Pages\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| United Kingdom\n | 26 June 1997[95][96] | Hardback Children's Edition\n | Bloomsbury | 223\n |\n| Paperback Children's Edition\n |\n| 11 September 1998[97] | Paperback Adult Edition (Original) |\n| 27 September 1999[98] | Hardback Signature Special Edition\n |\n| 8 October 2001[99] | Paperback Special Edition\n |\n| 10 July 2004[100] | Hardback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 336\n |\n| 4 October 2004[101] | Paperback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 223\n |\n| 1 November 2010[102] | Paperback Harry Potter Signature Edition\n |\n| 18 July 2013[103] | Paperback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) |\n| 1 September 2014[104][105] | Hardcover Children's Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 352\n |\n| Paperback Children's Edition (Re-issue with new cover) |\n| 6 October 2015[106] | Hardcover Illustrated Edition (Illustrated by Jim Kay) | 256\n |\n| 20 October 2020[107] | MinaLima Edition\n | 368\n |\n| 9 June 2022[108] | Hardcover Children's Edition (25th Anniversary Edition) | 352\n |\n| United States\n | 1 September 1998[109] | Hardback\n | Arthur A.

K. Rowling. The first novel in the *Harry Potter* series and Rowling's debut novel, it follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school and with the help of his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, he faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.\n\n\nThe book was first published in the United Kingdom on 26 June 1997 by Bloomsbury. It was published in the United States the following year by Scholastic Corporation under the title ***Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone***. It won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the *New York Times* list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least 73 other languages and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of its sequels. The novel has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making it the fourth best-selling book of all time.[1][2]\n\n\nMost reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors; Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as overcoming obstacles like bullying.\n\n\nThe *Harry Potter* series has been used as a source of object lessons in educational techniques, sociological analysis and marketing.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nHarry Potter lives with his abusive uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and their bullying son, Dudley. On Harry's eleventh birthday, Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant, delivers an acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, revealing that Harry's parents, James and Lily Potter, were wizards. When Harry was just a year old, a powerful but malevolent dark wizard named Lord Voldemort murdered his parents; Harry survived Voldemort's killing curse that rebounded and seemingly destroyed the Dark Lord, leaving a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. Unknown to Harry, this act made him famous in the wizarding world.\n\n\nHagrid escorts Harry to Diagon Alley, the hidden wizard commerce and retail section in London. Harry's parents have left him a fortune kept in Gringotts Wizarding Bank, which he uses to buy school supplies and a wand from Ollivander's. The cores of Harry and Lord Voldemort's wands have feathers from the same phoenix bird, making them \"brothers\". Hagrid gifts Harry an owl, whom he names as Hedwig, as a birthday present. A month later, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross railway station's secret Platform 9+3⁄4. En route to Hogwarts, Harry befriends fellow first year Ron Weasley and meets Hermione Granger, whom the two boys initially dislike.\n\n\nHarry runs afoul of Draco Malfoy, the spoiled son of a prominent wizard. At Hogwarts, a magical Sorting Hat sorts the first years among four school Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin) that best suit their personalities and talents. Draco joins Slytherin, known for producing dark wizards, while Harry, Ron, and Hermione are sorted into Gryffindor.\n\n\nHarry's broomstick flying ability earns him a place on the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the Seeker. Harry comes to dislike Potions master Severus Snape, who favours Slytherin while seeking to fail Harry. Malfoy tricks Harry and Ron into risking expulsion by leaving their common room after curfew. Hermione, unable to stop them, tags along. Realising Malfoy's ruse, they hide in a forbidden corridor and discover a gigantic three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. Harry and Ron later save Hermione from a troll during a Halloween celebration and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury and suspicious behaviour, Harry, Ron, and Hermione believe he is attempting to enter the trapdoor.\n\n\nDuring Harry's first Quidditch match, his broomstick attempts to buck him off. Snape's strange behaviour during the match convinces Hermione he jinxed Harry's broom. Harry receives an anonymous Christmas gift – his father's invisibility cloak. Using it to explore the school, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows what the viewer most desires. Harry sees his parents.\n\n\nA newspaper report later describes an attempted robbery at the same vault in Gringotts from which Hagrid retrieved an item for Hogwarts' headmaster Albus Dumbledore on the same day. The object beneath the trapdoor is the philosopher's stone, which grants its user immortality and the ability to turn any metal into pure gold. Firenze, a forest centaur, warns Harry that Voldemort is plotting to steal the stone to restore his body. When Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione, and Ron fear the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor.\n\n\nVarious obstacles force Ron and Hermione to remain behind while Harry proceeds. Harry encounters Professor Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He jinxed Harry's broom and let the troll into the school; Snape was protecting Harry. Voldemort, whose face has regrown on the back of Quirrell's head, is revealed to be the professor's secret master. Harry is forced to stand before the Mirror of Erised. It recognises Harry's lack of greed for the stone and deposits it into his pocket. Quirrell attempts to seize the stone, but his flesh burns upon contact with Harry. Harry's scar begins hurting, and he passes out.\n\n\nHarry awakens in the school's infirmary. He survived Voldemort because his mother sacrificing her life for him left a magical protective charm. Quirrell's hatred and greed caused him to burn upon contact with Harry; Voldemort abandoned him to die. Dumbledore reveals he sent Harry the invisibility cloak, while the philosopher's stone, that had been keeping the long-lived Nicolas Flamel alive, has been destroyed with Flamel's consent to prevent its being stolen. During the school's year-end feast, Gryffindor is awarded the House Cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys at Privet Drive until the next school year.\n\n\n\n## Characters[edit]\n\n\n* Harry Potter is an orphan whom Rowling imagined as a \"scrawny, black-haired, green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard.\"[3] She developed the series' story and characters to explain how Harry came to be in this situation and how his life unfolded from there.[4] Apart from the first chapter, the events of this book take place just before and in the year following Harry's eleventh birthday. Voldemort's attack left a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead,[4] which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort is present. Harry has a natural talent for Quidditch and became the first person in a century to get on their team in their first year.\n* Ron Weasley is Harry's age, and Rowling describes him as the ultimate best friend \"always there when you need him\".[5] He is freckled, red-haired, and quite tall. He grew up in a fairly large pure-blood family as the sixth born of seven children. Although his family is quite poor, they still live comfortably and happily. His loyalty and bravery in the face of a game of Wizards Chess plays a vital part in finding the Philosopher's Stone.\n* Hermione Granger, the daughter of an all-Muggle family, is a bossy girl who has apparently memorised most of the textbooks before the start of term. Rowling described Hermione as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character with \"a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness\".[6] Despite her nagging efforts to keep Harry and Ron out of trouble, she becomes a close friend of the two boys after they save her from a troll and her magical and analytical skills play an important role in finding the Philosopher's Stone. She has bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth.\n* Neville Longbottom is a plump, diffident boy, so forgetful that his grandmother gives him a Remembrall, to remind him if he forgets something. Neville's magical abilities are weak and appeared just in time to save his life when he was eight. Despite his timidity, Neville will fight anyone after some encouragement or if he thinks it is right and important.\n* Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant nearly 12 feet (3.7 m) tall, with tangled black hair and beard, was expelled from Hogwarts and his wand was snapped in half (resulting in him never to use a wand again), however Professor Dumbledore let him stay on as the school's gamekeeper, a job which enables him to give lavish affection, care and even pet names (such as Norbert the dragon) on even the most dangerous of magical creatures. Hagrid is fiercely loyal to Dumbledore and quickly becomes a close friend of Harry, Ron and, later, Hermione, but his carelessness makes him unreliable.\n* Professor Albus Dumbledore, a tall, thin man who wears half-moon spectacles and has silver hair and a beard that tucks into his belt, is the headmaster of Hogwarts, and thought to be the only wizard Voldemort fears. Dumbledore, while renowned for his achievements in magic, shrugs off praise, though he is aware of his own brilliance. Rowling described him as the \"epitome of goodness\".[7]\n* Professor Minerva McGonagall, a tall, severe-looking woman with black hair tied in a tight bun, teaches Transfiguration and is able to transform herself into a cat. She is Deputy Headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House.\n* Petunia Dursley, the sister of Harry's mother Lily, is a thin woman with a long neck that she uses for spying on the neighbours. As a Muggle, she regards her magical sister as a freak and tries to pretend that she never existed.\n* Vernon Dursley, the husband of Petunia Dursley, is a heavily built man whose irascible bluster covers a narrow mind and a fear of anything unusual.\n* Dudley Dursley is an overweight, spoilt bully and Harry's cousin.\n* Draco Malfoy is a slim, pale boy who speaks in a bored drawl. He is arrogant about his skill in Quidditch, and despises anyone who is not a pure-blood wizard  and wizards who do not share his views. His parents had supported Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard's disappearance, claiming they had been bewitched. Draco avoids direct confrontations and tries to get Harry and his friends into trouble.\n* Oliver Wood is Harry's Quidditch captain and keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.\n* Professor Quirrell is a twitching, stammering, and nervous man who teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts. Reputedly he was a brilliant scholar, but his nerve was shattered by an encounter with vampires. Quirrell wears a turban to conceal the fact that he is voluntarily possessed by Voldemort, whose face appears on the back of Quirrell's head.\n* Professor Severus Snape, who has a hooked nose, sallow complexion, and greasy black hair, teaches Potions, but would prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Snape favours pupils in Slytherin, his own House and seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is aiding Voldemort.\n* Argus Filch, the school caretaker who knows the school's secret passages better than anyone else except, perhaps, the Weasley twins. His cat, Mrs. Norris, aids his constant hunt for misbehaving pupils.\n\n\nOther members of staff include: the dumpy Herbology teacher and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick, the tiny and excitable Charms teacher and Head of Ravenclaw House, the soporific History of Magic teacher, Professor Binns, a ghost who does not seem to have noticed his own death, and Madam Hooch, the Quidditch coach, who is strict, but a considerate and methodical teacher. The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing trouble wherever he can.\n\n\nIn the book, Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters. The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero [Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined him as a \"scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard\"[3] and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him.[8] During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, \"always there when you need him\".[5] Rowling has described Hermione as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character with \"a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness\".[6]\n\n\nRowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind wizard Albus Dumbledore, who becomes Harry's confidant. Rowling described him as \"the epitome of goodness\".[7] His right hand is severe Minerva McGonagall, the friendly half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, who saved Harry from the Dursley family and the sinister Severus Snape. Professor Quirrell is also featured in the novel.\n\n\nThe main antagonists are Draco Malfoy, an elitist, bullying classmate,[9] and Lord Voldemort, the most powerful evil wizard who becomes disembodied when he tries to kill baby Harry. According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry and his backstory was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:\n\n\n\n\n> The basic idea... Harry, I saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And I knew he didn't know he was a wizard. ... And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. ... When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry—he tried to curse him. ... And—so—but for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since.[4]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Development, publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nThe book, which was Rowling's debut novel, was written between approximately June 1990 and some time in 1995. In 1990, Jo Rowling, as she preferred to be known,[a] wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words, \"One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head... A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy became more and more of a wizard to me... I began to write *Philosopher's Stone* that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product.\"[8] Then, Rowling's mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry.[8] Rowling spent six years working on *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels.[13] She sent the book to an literary agent and a publisher and then the second agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000 words. Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book[14] and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was \"so much better than anything else\".[15]\n\n\n\n### Publication and reception in the United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Imitation of the fictional Platform 9+3⁄4 at the real King's Cross railway station, with a luggage trolley apparently halfway through the magical wall\nBloomsbury accepted the book, paying Rowling a £2,500 advance[16] and Cunningham sent proof copies to carefully chosen authors, critics and booksellers in order to obtain comments that could be quoted when the book was launched.[14] He was less concerned about the book's length than about its author's name, since the title sounded like a boys' book to him and he believed boys preferred books by male authors. Rowling therefore adopted the pen name J. K. Rowling just before publication.[14]\n\n\nIn June 1997, Bloomsbury published *Philosopher's Stone* with an initial print run of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries.[17] Her original name, \"Joanne Rowling\", can be found on the copyright page of all British editions until September 1999. (The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to \"Joanne\" completely.)[18] The short initial print run was standard for first novels and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers.[14] Examples from this initial print run have sold for as much as US$471,000 in a 2021 Heritage auction.[19] Thomas Taylor created the cover for the first edition.[14]\n\n\nLindsey Fraser, who had previously supplied one of the blurb comments,[14] wrote what is thought to be the first published review, in *The Scotsman* on 28 June 1997. She described *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* as \"a hugely entertaining thriller\" and Rowling as \"a first-rate writer for children\".[14][20] Another early review, in *The Herald*, said: \"I have yet to find a child who can put it down.\" Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews in *The Guardian* and *The Sunday Times* and in September 1997 *Books for Keeps*, a magazine that specialised in children's books, gave the novel four stars out of five.[14] *Sunday Times* said:\"comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified\", while *The Guardian* called it \"a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit\" and *The Scotsman* said it had \"all the makings of a classic\".[14]\n\n\nIn 1997 the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9- to 11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize.[21] The *Smarties* award, which is voted for by children, made the book well known within six months of publication, while most children's books have to wait for years.[14] The following year, *Philosopher's Stone* won almost all the other major British awards that were decided by children.[14][b] It was also shortlisted for children's books awards adjudicated by adults,[22] but did not win. Sandra Beckett commented that books that were popular with children were regarded as undemanding and as not of the highest literary standards – for example, the literary establishment disdained the works of Dahl, an overwhelming favourite of children before the appearance of Rowling's books.[23] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 22 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[24]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* won two publishing industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit, the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and the Booksellers' Association / *Bookseller* Author of the Year.[14] By March 1999 UK editions had sold just over 300,000 copies[25] and the story was still the UK's best-selling title in December 2001.[26] A Braille edition was published in May 1998 by the Scottish Braille Press.[27]\n\n\nPlatform 9+3⁄4, from which the Hogwarts Express left London, was commemorated in the real-life King's Cross railway station with a sign and a trolley apparently passing through the wall.[28]\n\n\n\n\n### US publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUK to American translation examples[29][30]\n| UK | American\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| mum, mam | mom\n |\n| sherbet lemon | lemon drop |\n| motorbike | motorcycle\n |\n| chips | fries\n |\n| crisp | chip\n |\n| jelly | Jell-O |\n| jacket potato | baked potato\n |\n| jumper | sweater\n |\n\n\nScholastic Corporation bought the US rights at the Bologna Book Fair in April 1997 for US$105,000, an unusually high sum for a children's book.[14] Scholastic's Arthur Levine thought that \"philosopher\" sounded too archaic for readers[31] and after some discussion (including the proposed title \"Harry Potter and the School of Magic\"[32]), the American edition was published in September 1998[33] under the title Rowling suggested, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.[14] Rowling later said that she regretted this change and would have fought it if she had been in a stronger position at the time.[10] Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy and the meaning of some other terms changed in translation, for example from \"crumpet\" to \"muffin\". While Rowling accepted the change from both the British English \"mum\" and Seamus Finnigan's Irish variant \"mam\" to the American variant \"mom\" in *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, she vetoed this change in the later books, which was then reversed in later editions of *Philosopher's Stone*. However, Nel considered that Scholastic's translations were considerably more sensitive than most of those imposed on British English books of the time and that some other changes could be regarded as useful copyedits.[29] Since the UK editions of early titles in the series were published months prior to the American versions, some American readers became familiar with the British English versions owing to having bought them from online retailers.[34]\n\n\nAt first the most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library publications such as *Kirkus Reviews* and *Booklist*, which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by *Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices*, which noted complexity, depth and consistency in the world that Rowling had built) attracted the attention of reviewers in major newspapers.[35] Although *The Boston Globe* and Michael Winerip in *The New York Times* complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book,[20][36] they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.[14][20]\nA year later, the US edition was selected as an American Library Association Notable Book, a *Publishers Weekly* Best Book of 1998 and a New York Public Library 1998 Best Book of the Year and won *Parenting Magazine*'s Book of the Year Award for 1998,[21] the *School Library Journal* Best Book of the Year and the American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults.[14] In 2012 it was ranked number 3 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by *School Library Journal*.[37]\n\n\nIn August 1999, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* topped the *New York Times* list of best-selling fiction[38] and stayed near the top of the list for much of 1999 and 2000, until the *New York Times* split its list into children's and adult sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher placings.[23][35] *Publishers Weekly*'s report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6 million copies).[39]\n\n\nIn May 2008, Scholastic announced the creation of a 10th Anniversary Edition of the book[40] that was released on 1 October 2008[41] to mark the tenth anniversary of the original American release.[40] For the fifteenth anniversary of the books, Scholastic re-released *Sorcerer's Stone*, along with the other six novels in the series, with new cover art by Kazu Kibuishi in 2013.[42][43][44]\n\n\n\n### Translations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter in translation\n\nBy mid-2008, official translations of the book had been published in 67 languages.[45][46] By November 2017, the book had been translated into 80 languages, the 80th being Lowland Scots.[47] Bloomsbury have published translations in Latin and in Ancient Greek,[48][49] with the latter being described as \"one of the most important pieces of Ancient Greek prose written in many centuries\".[50]\n\n\n\n## Style and themes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harry Potter influences and analogues\n\nPhilip Nel highlighted the influence of Jane Austen, whom Rowling has greatly admired since the age of twelve. Both novelists greatly encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line – for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the *Harry Potter* books is reminiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirise social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However, in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on caricature and the names she invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens's stories,[20]: 13–15 and Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature.[51] Rowling, like the Narnia series' author C. S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines literary genres‍—‌fantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, *Bildungsroman* and many others.[20]: 51–52\n\n\nSome reviewers compared *Philosopher's Stone* to the stories of Roald Dahl, who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of *Philosopher's Stone*, seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was an American, R. L. Stine. Some of the story elements in *Philosopher's Stone* resembled parts of Dahl's stories. For example, the hero of *James and the Giant Peach* lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts‍—‌one fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.[14]\n\n\nLibrarian Nancy Knapp and marketing professor Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as Diagon Alley.[21][52] Tad Brennan commented that Rowling's writing resembles that of Homer: \"rapid, plain, and direct in expression\".[50] Stephen King admired \"the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable\" and concluded that they worked because Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.[53]\n\n\nNicholas Tucker described the early *Harry Potter* books as looking back to Victorian and Edwardian children's stories: Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which they were associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Argus Filch's cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak.[54] Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society including many social stereotypes.[55] However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.[56]\n\n\nSusan Hall wrote that there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic officials are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.[57]\n\n\nNel suggested that the unflattering characterisation of the extremely conventional, status-conscious, materialistic Dursleys was Rowling's reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual couple as the \"preferred norm\", while the author was a single mother. Harry's relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty. This is reflected in his happiness whenever he is a temporary member of the Weasley family throughout the series, and in his treatment of first Rubeus Hagrid and later Remus Lupin and Sirius Black as father-figures.[20]: 13–15, 47–48[51]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Sequels[edit]\n\n\nThe second book, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and later, in the US on 2 June 1999.[58][59] *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was then published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999.[58][59] *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.[60] *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* is the longest book in the series at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version.[61] It was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003.[62] *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* was published on 16 July 2005 and sold 11 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release.[63][64] The seventh and final novel, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, was published on 21 July 2007.[65] The book sold 11 million copies within 24 hours of its release: 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.[66]\n\n\n\n### Illustrated version[edit]\n\n\nAn illustrated version of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* was released on 6 October 2015, with illustrations by Jim Kay.[67][68] The book carries over 100 illustrations and will be followed by illustrated versions of all seven books from the series by the same artist.\n\n\n\n### Podcast version[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2020, a reading podcast by Spotify was created and entitled *Harry Potter at Home: Readings*.

Writing about clinical teaching in medical schools, Jennifer Conn contrasted Snape's technical expertise with his intimidating behaviour towards students. Quidditch coach Madam Hooch on the other hand, illustrated useful techniques in the teaching of physical skills, including breaking down complex actions into sequences of simple ones and helping students to avoid common errors.[93] Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class: \"sociological concepts including culture, society, and socialisation; stratification and social inequality; social institutions; and social theory\".[55]\n\n\nStephen Brown noted that the early *Harry Potter* books, especially *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, were a runaway success despite inadequate and poorly organised marketing. Brown advised marketing executives to be less preoccupied with rigorous statistical analyses and the \"analysis, planning, implementation, and control\" model of management. Instead he recommended that they should treat the stories as \"a marketing masterclass\", full of enticing products and brand names.[52] For example, a real-world analogue of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans was introduced under licence in 2000 by toymaker Hasbro.[52][94]\n\n\n\n## Release history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Release date\n | Edition(Hardback/Paperback) | Publisher\n | Pages\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| United Kingdom\n | 26 June 1997[95][96] | Hardback Children's Edition\n | Bloomsbury | 223\n |\n| Paperback Children's Edition\n |\n| 11 September 1998[97] | Paperback Adult Edition (Original) |\n| 27 September 1999[98] | Hardback Signature Special Edition\n |\n| 8 October 2001[99] | Paperback Special Edition\n |\n| 10 July 2004[100] | Hardback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 336\n |\n| 4 October 2004[101] | Paperback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 223\n |\n| 1 November 2010[102] | Paperback Harry Potter Signature Edition\n |\n| 18 July 2013[103] | Paperback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) |\n| 1 September 2014[104][105] | Hardcover Children's Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 352\n |\n| Paperback Children's Edition (Re-issue with new cover) |\n| 6 October 2015[106] | Hardcover Illustrated Edition (Illustrated by Jim Kay) | 256\n |\n| 20 October 2020[107] | MinaLima Edition\n | 368\n |\n| 9 June 2022[108] | Hardcover Children's Edition (25th Anniversary Edition) | 352\n |\n| United States\n | 1 September 1998[109] | Hardback\n | Arthur A.

K. Rowling and the second novel in the *Harry Potter* series. The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the \"Chamber of Secrets\" has been opened and that the \"heir of Slytherin\" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found after attacks that leave residents of the school petrified. Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks.\n\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and later in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling says she found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers, and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, whereas others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and the way one's character is the result of one's choices.\n\n\nSeveral commentators have noted that personal identity is a strong theme in the book and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-human, non-magical, and non-living people. Some commentators regard the story's diary that writes back as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent.\n\n\nThe film adaptation of the novel, released in 2002, became (at the time) the sixth highest-grossing film ever and received generally favourable reviews. Video games loosely based on *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nWhile spending the summer at the Dursleys, twelve-year-old Harry Potter is visited by Dobby, a house-elf. He says Harry is in danger and must not return to Hogwarts. Harry refuses, so Dobby magically ruins Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's dinner party. Furious, Uncle Vernon locks Harry into his room. The Ministry of Magic sends a notice accusing Harry of performing underage magic and threatening dismissal from Hogwarts.\n\n\nThe three Weasley brothers, Ron, Fred and George, arrive in their father's flying Ford Anglia and rescue Harry, taking him to their home. Harry and the Weasley family travel to Diagon Alley for school supplies. They run into Hermione Granger and meet Lucius Malfoy, father of Draco, and also Gilderoy Lockhart, a conceited autobiographer and adventurer who is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. At King's Cross station, Harry and Ron cannot enter Platform 9¾ and miss the Hogwarts Express. They fly in Mr Weasley's car to Hogwarts, crashing into the Whomping Willow on school grounds and damaging Ron's wand. The car then escapes into the forest.\n\n\nLater, Harry is the only one who hears a strange voice emanating from the castle walls. Soon after, Mr Filch's cat, Mrs Norris, is found petrified, along with a bloody warning scrawled on a wall: \"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware\". Salazar Slytherin, one of the school's founders, created the Chamber after a dispute with fellow founders on admitting Muggle-born students. Some in the wizarding community disdain Muggle-born wizards like Hermione, believing pure-bloods are superior. The Chamber supposedly houses a monster that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.\n\n\nDuring a Quidditch game, a rogue Bludger strikes Harry, breaking his arm. Lockhart blunders an attempt to repair it, sending Harry to the hospital overnight. Dobby visits Harry and reveals he jinxed the Bludger and sealed the portal at King's Cross. He says the Chamber of Secrets was once opened years before. After another attack, students attend a defensive duelling class, during which Harry exhibits a rare ability to speak 'Parseltongue', the language of snakes.\n\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione suspect Draco is the Heir, given his hostility toward Muggle-borns. Hermione brews Polyjuice Potion, allowing Harry and Ron to impersonate Draco's lackeys Crabbe and Goyle. They learn that Draco knows nothing about the heir. Meanwhile, Moaning Myrtle, a ghost that haunts a girls' bathroom, shows the trio a diary left in her stall. It belonged to Tom Riddle, a student who witnessed another student's death during the Chamber's previous opening. Riddle's consciousness within the diary claims that Hagrid was responsible. Hermione is petrified in the next attack. The school is put on lockdown and may close. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore is forced out and Hagrid is sent to Azkaban prison.\n\n\nFollowing instructions left by Hagrid, Harry and Ron follow spiders into the Forbidden Forest. They encounter Aragog, a gigantic Acromantula which denies its involvement, and claims spiders fear the real monster. Aragog attempts to feed Harry and Ron to its progeny, but Mr Weasley's car rescues them. Harry and Ron discover that Hermione deduced the monster is a basilisk – a gigantic snake whose direct gaze kills and petrifies victims when seen in a reflection. The basilisk is the voice in the walls, and it travels through the plumbing. Moaning Myrtle was the student that was killed.\n\n\nRon's sister Ginny is abducted and taken into the Chamber. Harry and Ron discover the entrance in Myrtle's bathroom, and force Lockhart to enter it with them. Lockhart confesses he is a fraud who made up all of his stories and attempts to erase the boys' memories after stealing Ron's damaged wand. The spell backfires, obliterating his own memory, and causes a cave-in; Ron is separated from Harry and stays behind to help Lockhart.\n\n\nHarry proceeds to the Chamber and finds an unconscious Ginny. A manifestation of Tom Riddle reveals he is Lord Voldemort and the Heir of Slytherin. He opened the Chamber and framed Hagrid. He has been using the diary to possess and control Ginny, who had been behaving strangely. The basilisk appears to kill Harry. Dumbledore's phoenix Fawkes arrives, bringing Harry the Sorting Hat. Fawkes blinds the basilisk and Harry pulls the Sword of Godric Gryffindor from the Hat. He slays the basilisk but is poisoned by its venom. As Riddle taunts the dying Harry, Fawkes' tears heal Harry. Harry stabs Riddle's diary with a severed basilisk fang, destroying it and Riddle's body, and reviving Ginny.\n\n\nHarry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart return to the castle. Harry gives the diary to Dumbledore. Lucius bursts in, furious that Dumbledore returned. He is accompanied by Dobby, who is the Malfoys' house-elf and was working to protect Harry. Harry realizes that Lucius slipped the diary into Ginny's cauldron while they were in Diagon Alley to open the Chamber. Harry tricks Lucius into freeing Dobby from servitude by giving him a sock; Lucius attempts to attack Harry in revenge, but Dobby repels him.\n\n\nThe petrified students are cured, Gryffindor wins the House Cup again, Hagrid is released, Lockhart is confined to St. Mungo's Hospital, and Harry returns to Privet Drive in high spirits.\n\n\n\n## Publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nJ.K Rowling found it difficult to finish *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* because she was afraid it would not live up to the expectations raised by *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision.[1]\n\n\nIn early drafts of the book, the ghost Nearly Headless Nick sang a self-composed song explaining his condition and the circumstances of his unknown death. This was cut because the book's editor did not care for the poem, which has been subsequently published as an extra on J. K. Rowling's official website.[2] The family background of Dean Thomas was removed because Rowling and her publishers considered it an \"unnecessary digression,\" and she considered Neville Longbottom's own journey of discovery \"more important to the central plot.\"[3]\n\n\n\n### Publication[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* was published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999.[4][5] It immediately took first place in UK bestseller lists, displacing popular authors such as John Grisham, Tom Clancy[1] and Terry Pratchett,[6] and making Rowling the first author to win the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year for two years in succession.[7] In June 1999, it went straight to the top of three US bestseller lists,[8] including in *The New York Times*.[9]\n\n\nFirst edition printings had several errors, which were fixed in subsequent reprints.[10] Initially, Dumbledore said Voldemort was the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin instead of his descendant.[10] Gilderoy Lockhart's book on werewolves is entitled *Weekends with Werewolves* at one point and *Wanderings with Werewolves* later in the book.[11]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* was met with near-universal acclaim. In *The Times*, Deborah Loudon described it as a children's book that would be \"re-read into adulthood\" and highlighted its \"strong plots, engaging characters, excellent jokes and a moral message which flows naturally from the story\".[12] Fantasy author Charles de Lint agreed, and considered the second Harry Potter book to be just as good as *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, a rare achievement among series of books.[13] Thomas Wagner regarded the plot as very similar to that of the first book, based on searching for a secret hidden under the school. However, he enjoyed the parody of celebrities and their fans that centres round Gilderoy Lockhart, and approved of the book's handling of racism.[14] Tammy Nezol found the book more disturbing than its predecessor, particularly in the rash behaviour of Harry and his friends after Harry withholds information from Dumbledore, and in the human-like behaviour of the mandragoras used to make a potion that cures petrification. Nevertheless, she considered the second story as enjoyable as the first.[15]\n\n\nMary Stuart thought the final conflict with Tom Riddle in the Chamber was almost as scary as in some of Stephen King's works, and perhaps too strong for young or timid children. She commented that \"there are enough surprises and imaginative details thrown in as would normally fill five lesser books.\" Like other reviewers, she thought the book would give pleasure to both children and adult readers.[16] According to Philip Nel, the early reviews gave unalloyed praise while the later ones included some criticisms, although they still agreed that the book was outstanding.[17]\n\n\nWriting after all seven books had been published, Graeme Davis regarded *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* as the weakest of the series, and agreed that the plot structure is much the same as in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. He described Fawkes's appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a *deus ex machina*: he said that the book does not explain how Fawkes knew where to find Harry; and Fawkes's timing had to be very precise, as arriving earlier would probably have prevented the battle with the basilisk, while arriving later would have been fatal to Harry and Ginny.[18]\n\n\n\n### Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\nRowling's *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* was the recipient of several awards.[19] The American Library Association listed the novel among its 2000 Notable Children's Books,[20]\nas well as its Best Books for Young Adults.[21] In 1999, Booklist named *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* as one of its Editors' Choices,[22] and as one of its Top Ten Fantasy Novels for Youth.[19] The Cooperative Children's Book Center made the novel a CCBC Choice of 2000 in the \"Fiction for Children\" category.[23] The novel also won Children's Book of the Year British Book Award,[24] and was shortlisted for the 1998 Guardian Children's Award and the 1998 Carnegie Award.[19]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize 1998 Gold Medal in the 9–11 years division.[24] Rowling also won two other Nestlé Smarties Book Prizes for *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* and *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*. The Scottish Arts Council awarded their first ever Children's Book Award to the novel in 1999,[25] and it was also awarded Whitaker's Platinum Book Award in 2001.[19][26] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 23 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[27]\n\n\n\n## Main themes[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* continues to examine what makes a person who he or she is, which began in the first book. As well as maintaining that Harry's identity is shaped by his decisions rather than any aspect of his birth,[15][28] *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* provides contrasting characters who try to conceal their true personalities: as Tammy Nezol puts it, Gilderoy Lockhart \"lacks any real identity\" because he is nothing more than a charming liar.[15] Riddle also complicates Harry's struggle to understand himself by pointing out the similarities between the two: \"both half-bloods, orphans raised by Muggles, probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin.\"[29]\n\n\nOpposition to class, death and its impacts, experiencing adolescence, sacrifice, love, friendship, loyalty, prejudice, and racism are constant themes of the series. In *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* Harry's consideration and respect for others extends to the lowly, non-human Dobby and the ghost Nearly Headless Nick.[30] According to Marguerite Krause, achievements in the novel depend more on ingenuity and hard work than on natural talents.[31]\n\n\nEdward Duffy, associate professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of *Chamber of Secrets* is Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas.[32] Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.[33]\n\n\nImmorality and the portrayal of authority as negative are significant themes in the novel. Marguerite Krause states there are few absolute moral rules in Harry Potter's world, for example Harry prefers to tell the truth, but lies whenever he considers it necessary – very like his enemy Draco Malfoy.[31] At the end of *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, Dumbledore retracts his promise to punish Harry and Ron if they break any more school rules – after Professor McGonagall estimates they have broken over 100 – and lavishly rewards them for ending the threat from the Chamber of Secrets.[34] Krause further states that authority figures and political institutions receive little respect from Rowling.[31] William MacNeil of Griffith University, Queensland, Australia states that the Minister for Magic is presented as a mediocrity.[35] In his article \"Harry Potter and the Secular City\", Ken Jacobson suggests the Ministry as a whole is portrayed as a tangle of bureaucratic empires, saying that \"Ministry officials busy themselves with minutiae (e.g. standardising cauldron thicknesses) and coin politically correct euphemisms like 'non-magical community' (for Muggles) and 'memory modification' (for magical brainwashing).\"[28]\n\n\nThis novel implies it begins in 1992: the cake for Nearly-Headless Nick's 500th deathday party bears the words \"Sir Nicholas De Mimsy Porpington died 31 October 1492\".[36][37]\n\n\n\n### Connection to *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\n*Chamber of Secrets* has many links with the sixth book of the series, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*. In fact, *Half-Blood Prince* was the working title of *Chamber of Secrets* and Rowling says she originally intended to present some \"crucial pieces of information\" in the second book, but ultimately felt \"this information's proper home was book six\".[38] Some objects that play significant roles in *Half-Blood Prince* first appear in *Chamber of Secrets*: the Hand of Glory and the opal necklace that are on sale in Borgin and Burkes; a Vanishing Cabinet in Hogwarts that is damaged by Peeves the Poltergeist; and Tom Riddle's diary, which is later revealed to be a Horcrux.[39] Additionally, these two novels are the ones with the most focus on Harry's relationship with Ginny Weasley.\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)\n\nThe film version of *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* was released in 2002.[40] Chris Columbus directed the film,[41] and the screenplay was written by Steve Kloves. It became the third film to exceed $600 million in international box office sales, preceded by *Titanic*, released in 1997, and *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, released in 2001.[42] The film was nominated for a Saturn Award for the Best Fantasy Film,[42][43] According to Metacritic, the film version of *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* received \"generally favourable reviews\" with an average score of 63%,[44] and another aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes, gave it a score of 82%.[41]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)\n\nFive unique video games by different developers were released between 2002 and 2003 by Electronic Arts, loosely based on the book:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Developer | Release date | Platform | Genre | GameRankings | Metacritic | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| KnowWonder | 14 November 2002 | Microsoft Windows | Adventure/puzzle | 71.46%[45] | 77/100[46] |  |\n| Argonaut | PlayStation | Action-adventure | 70.50%[47] | 74/100[48] |  |\n| Griptonite | Game Boy Color | Role-playing game | 77.33%[49] | — |  |\n| Eurocom | Game Boy Advance | Action puzzle | 73.44%[50] | 76/100[51] |  |\n| GameCube | Action-adventure | 73.29%[52] | 77/100[53] |  |\n| PlayStation 2 | 70.44%[54] | 71/100[55] |  |\n| Xbox | 74.58%[56] | 77/100[57] |  |\n| Aspyr | 10 April 2003 | Mac OS X | Adventure/puzzle | — | — | Port of Windows version\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sexton, Colleen (2007). \"Pottermania\". *J.

K. Rowling and the second novel in the *Harry Potter* series. The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the \"Chamber of Secrets\" has been opened and that the \"heir of Slytherin\" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found after attacks that leave residents of the school petrified. Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks.\n\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and later in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling says she found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers, and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, whereas others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and the way one's character is the result of one's choices.\n\n\nSeveral commentators have noted that personal identity is a strong theme in the book and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-human, non-magical, and non-living people. Some commentators regard the story's diary that writes back as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent.\n\n\nThe film adaptation of the novel, released in 2002, became (at the time) the sixth highest-grossing film ever and received generally favourable reviews. Video games loosely based on *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nWhile spending the summer at the Dursleys, twelve-year-old Harry Potter is visited by Dobby, a house-elf. He says Harry is in danger and must not return to Hogwarts. Harry refuses, so Dobby magically ruins Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's dinner party. Furious, Uncle Vernon locks Harry into his room. The Ministry of Magic sends a notice accusing Harry of performing underage magic and threatening dismissal from Hogwarts.\n\n\nThe three Weasley brothers, Ron, Fred and George, arrive in their father's flying Ford Anglia and rescue Harry, taking him to their home. Harry and the Weasley family travel to Diagon Alley for school supplies. They run into Hermione Granger and meet Lucius Malfoy, father of Draco, and also Gilderoy Lockhart, a conceited autobiographer and adventurer who is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. At King's Cross station, Harry and Ron cannot enter Platform 9¾ and miss the Hogwarts Express. They fly in Mr Weasley's car to Hogwarts, crashing into the Whomping Willow on school grounds and damaging Ron's wand. The car then escapes into the forest.\n\n\nLater, Harry is the only one who hears a strange voice emanating from the castle walls. Soon after, Mr Filch's cat, Mrs Norris, is found petrified, along with a bloody warning scrawled on a wall: \"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware\". Salazar Slytherin, one of the school's founders, created the Chamber after a dispute with fellow founders on admitting Muggle-born students. Some in the wizarding community disdain Muggle-born wizards like Hermione, believing pure-bloods are superior. The Chamber supposedly houses a monster that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.\n\n\nDuring a Quidditch game, a rogue Bludger strikes Harry, breaking his arm. Lockhart blunders an attempt to repair it, sending Harry to the hospital overnight. Dobby visits Harry and reveals he jinxed the Bludger and sealed the portal at King's Cross. He says the Chamber of Secrets was once opened years before. After another attack, students attend a defensive duelling class, during which Harry exhibits a rare ability to speak 'Parseltongue', the language of snakes.\n\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione suspect Draco is the Heir, given his hostility toward Muggle-borns. Hermione brews Polyjuice Potion, allowing Harry and Ron to impersonate Draco's lackeys Crabbe and Goyle. They learn that Draco knows nothing about the heir. Meanwhile, Moaning Myrtle, a ghost that haunts a girls' bathroom, shows the trio a diary left in her stall. It belonged to Tom Riddle, a student who witnessed another student's death during the Chamber's previous opening. Riddle's consciousness within the diary claims that Hagrid was responsible. Hermione is petrified in the next attack. The school is put on lockdown and may close. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore is forced out and Hagrid is sent to Azkaban prison.\n\n\nFollowing instructions left by Hagrid, Harry and Ron follow spiders into the Forbidden Forest. They encounter Aragog, a gigantic Acromantula which denies its involvement, and claims spiders fear the real monster. Aragog attempts to feed Harry and Ron to its progeny, but Mr Weasley's car rescues them. Harry and Ron discover that Hermione deduced the monster is a basilisk – a gigantic snake whose direct gaze kills and petrifies victims when seen in a reflection. The basilisk is the voice in the walls, and it travels through the plumbing. Moaning Myrtle was the student that was killed.\n\n\nRon's sister Ginny is abducted and taken into the Chamber. Harry and Ron discover the entrance in Myrtle's bathroom, and force Lockhart to enter it with them. Lockhart confesses he is a fraud who made up all of his stories and attempts to erase the boys' memories after stealing Ron's damaged wand. The spell backfires, obliterating his own memory, and causes a cave-in; Ron is separated from Harry and stays behind to help Lockhart.\n\n\nHarry proceeds to the Chamber and finds an unconscious Ginny. A manifestation of Tom Riddle reveals he is Lord Voldemort and the Heir of Slytherin. He opened the Chamber and framed Hagrid. He has been using the diary to possess and control Ginny, who had been behaving strangely. The basilisk appears to kill Harry. Dumbledore's phoenix Fawkes arrives, bringing Harry the Sorting Hat. Fawkes blinds the basilisk and Harry pulls the Sword of Godric Gryffindor from the Hat. He slays the basilisk but is poisoned by its venom. As Riddle taunts the dying Harry, Fawkes' tears heal Harry. Harry stabs Riddle's diary with a severed basilisk fang, destroying it and Riddle's body, and reviving Ginny.\n\n\nHarry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart return to the castle. Harry gives the diary to Dumbledore. Lucius bursts in, furious that Dumbledore returned. He is accompanied by Dobby, who is the Malfoys' house-elf and was working to protect Harry. Harry realizes that Lucius slipped the diary into Ginny's cauldron while they were in Diagon Alley to open the Chamber. Harry tricks Lucius into freeing Dobby from servitude by giving him a sock; Lucius attempts to attack Harry in revenge, but Dobby repels him.\n\n\nThe petrified students are cured, Gryffindor wins the House Cup again, Hagrid is released, Lockhart is confined to St. Mungo's Hospital, and Harry returns to Privet Drive in high spirits.\n\n\n\n## Publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nJ.K Rowling found it difficult to finish *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* because she was afraid it would not live up to the expectations raised by *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision.[1]\n\n\nIn early drafts of the book, the ghost Nearly Headless Nick sang a self-composed song explaining his condition and the circumstances of his unknown death. This was cut because the book's editor did not care for the poem, which has been subsequently published as an extra on J. K. Rowling's official website.[2] The family background of Dean Thomas was removed because Rowling and her publishers considered it an \"unnecessary digression,\" and she considered Neville Longbottom's own journey of discovery \"more important to the central plot.\"[3]\n\n\n\n### Publication[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* was published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999.[4][5] It immediately took first place in UK bestseller lists, displacing popular authors such as John Grisham, Tom Clancy[1] and Terry Pratchett,[6] and making Rowling the first author to win the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year for two years in succession.[7] In June 1999, it went straight to the top of three US bestseller lists,[8] including in *The New York Times*.[9]\n\n\nFirst edition printings had several errors, which were fixed in subsequent reprints.[10] Initially, Dumbledore said Voldemort was the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin instead of his descendant.[10] Gilderoy Lockhart's book on werewolves is entitled *Weekends with Werewolves* at one point and *Wanderings with Werewolves* later in the book.[11]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* was met with near-universal acclaim. In *The Times*, Deborah Loudon described it as a children's book that would be \"re-read into adulthood\" and highlighted its \"strong plots, engaging characters, excellent jokes and a moral message which flows naturally from the story\".[12] Fantasy author Charles de Lint agreed, and considered the second Harry Potter book to be just as good as *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, a rare achievement among series of books.[13] Thomas Wagner regarded the plot as very similar to that of the first book, based on searching for a secret hidden under the school. However, he enjoyed the parody of celebrities and their fans that centres round Gilderoy Lockhart, and approved of the book's handling of racism.[14] Tammy Nezol found the book more disturbing than its predecessor, particularly in the rash behaviour of Harry and his friends after Harry withholds information from Dumbledore, and in the human-like behaviour of the mandragoras used to make a potion that cures petrification. Nevertheless, she considered the second story as enjoyable as the first.[15]\n\n\nMary Stuart thought the final conflict with Tom Riddle in the Chamber was almost as scary as in some of Stephen King's works, and perhaps too strong for young or timid children. She commented that \"there are enough surprises and imaginative details thrown in as would normally fill five lesser books.\" Like other reviewers, she thought the book would give pleasure to both children and adult readers.[16] According to Philip Nel, the early reviews gave unalloyed praise while the later ones included some criticisms, although they still agreed that the book was outstanding.[17]\n\n\nWriting after all seven books had been published, Graeme Davis regarded *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* as the weakest of the series, and agreed that the plot structure is much the same as in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. He described Fawkes's appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a *deus ex machina*: he said that the book does not explain how Fawkes knew where to find Harry; and Fawkes's timing had to be very precise, as arriving earlier would probably have prevented the battle with the basilisk, while arriving later would have been fatal to Harry and Ginny.[18]\n\n\n\n### Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\nRowling's *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* was the recipient of several awards.[19] The American Library Association listed the novel among its 2000 Notable Children's Books,[20]\nas well as its Best Books for Young Adults.[21] In 1999, Booklist named *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* as one of its Editors' Choices,[22] and as one of its Top Ten Fantasy Novels for Youth.[19] The Cooperative Children's Book Center made the novel a CCBC Choice of 2000 in the \"Fiction for Children\" category.[23] The novel also won Children's Book of the Year British Book Award,[24] and was shortlisted for the 1998 Guardian Children's Award and the 1998 Carnegie Award.[19]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize 1998 Gold Medal in the 9–11 years division.[24] Rowling also won two other Nestlé Smarties Book Prizes for *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* and *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*. The Scottish Arts Council awarded their first ever Children's Book Award to the novel in 1999,[25] and it was also awarded Whitaker's Platinum Book Award in 2001.[19][26] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 23 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[27]\n\n\n\n## Main themes[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* continues to examine what makes a person who he or she is, which began in the first book. As well as maintaining that Harry's identity is shaped by his decisions rather than any aspect of his birth,[15][28] *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* provides contrasting characters who try to conceal their true personalities: as Tammy Nezol puts it, Gilderoy Lockhart \"lacks any real identity\" because he is nothing more than a charming liar.[15] Riddle also complicates Harry's struggle to understand himself by pointing out the similarities between the two: \"both half-bloods, orphans raised by Muggles, probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin.\"[29]\n\n\nOpposition to class, death and its impacts, experiencing adolescence, sacrifice, love, friendship, loyalty, prejudice, and racism are constant themes of the series. In *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* Harry's consideration and respect for others extends to the lowly, non-human Dobby and the ghost Nearly Headless Nick.[30] According to Marguerite Krause, achievements in the novel depend more on ingenuity and hard work than on natural talents.[31]\n\n\nEdward Duffy, associate professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of *Chamber of Secrets* is Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas.[32] Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.[33]\n\n\nImmorality and the portrayal of authority as negative are significant themes in the novel. Marguerite Krause states there are few absolute moral rules in Harry Potter's world, for example Harry prefers to tell the truth, but lies whenever he considers it necessary – very like his enemy Draco Malfoy.[31] At the end of *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, Dumbledore retracts his promise to punish Harry and Ron if they break any more school rules – after Professor McGonagall estimates they have broken over 100 – and lavishly rewards them for ending the threat from the Chamber of Secrets.[34] Krause further states that authority figures and political institutions receive little respect from Rowling.[31] William MacNeil of Griffith University, Queensland, Australia states that the Minister for Magic is presented as a mediocrity.[35] In his article \"Harry Potter and the Secular City\", Ken Jacobson suggests the Ministry as a whole is portrayed as a tangle of bureaucratic empires, saying that \"Ministry officials busy themselves with minutiae (e.g. standardising cauldron thicknesses) and coin politically correct euphemisms like 'non-magical community' (for Muggles) and 'memory modification' (for magical brainwashing).\"[28]\n\n\nThis novel implies it begins in 1992: the cake for Nearly-Headless Nick's 500th deathday party bears the words \"Sir Nicholas De Mimsy Porpington died 31 October 1492\".[36][37]\n\n\n\n### Connection to *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*[edit]\n\n\n*Chamber of Secrets* has many links with the sixth book of the series, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*. In fact, *Half-Blood Prince* was the working title of *Chamber of Secrets* and Rowling says she originally intended to present some \"crucial pieces of information\" in the second book, but ultimately felt \"this information's proper home was book six\".[38] Some objects that play significant roles in *Half-Blood Prince* first appear in *Chamber of Secrets*: the Hand of Glory and the opal necklace that are on sale in Borgin and Burkes; a Vanishing Cabinet in Hogwarts that is damaged by Peeves the Poltergeist; and Tom Riddle's diary, which is later revealed to be a Horcrux.[39] Additionally, these two novels are the ones with the most focus on Harry's relationship with Ginny Weasley.\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)\n\nThe film version of *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* was released in 2002.[40] Chris Columbus directed the film,[41] and the screenplay was written by Steve Kloves. It became the third film to exceed $600 million in international box office sales, preceded by *Titanic*, released in 1997, and *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, released in 2001.[42] The film was nominated for a Saturn Award for the Best Fantasy Film,[42][43] According to Metacritic, the film version of *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* received \"generally favourable reviews\" with an average score of 63%,[44] and another aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes, gave it a score of 82%.[41]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)\n\nFive unique video games by different developers were released between 2002 and 2003 by Electronic Arts, loosely based on the book:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Developer | Release date | Platform | Genre | GameRankings | Metacritic | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| KnowWonder | 14 November 2002 | Microsoft Windows | Adventure/puzzle | 71.46%[45] | 77/100[46] |  |\n| Argonaut | PlayStation | Action-adventure | 70.50%[47] | 74/100[48] |  |\n| Griptonite | Game Boy Color | Role-playing game | 77.33%[49] | — |  |\n| Eurocom | Game Boy Advance | Action puzzle | 73.44%[50] | 76/100[51] |  |\n| GameCube | Action-adventure | 73.29%[52] | 77/100[53] |  |\n| PlayStation 2 | 70.44%[54] | 71/100[55] |  |\n| Xbox | 74.58%[56] | 77/100[57] |  |\n| Aspyr | 10 April 2003 | Mac OS X | Adventure/puzzle | — | — | Port of Windows version\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sexton, Colleen (2007). \"Pottermania\". *J.

K. Rowling and is the third in the *Harry Potter* series. The book follows Harry Potter, a young wizard, in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Along with friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry investigates Sirius Black, an escaped prisoner from Azkaban, the wizard prison, believed to be one of Lord Voldemort's old allies.\n\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom on 8 July 1999 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 8 September 1999 by Scholastic, Inc.[1][2][3][4] Rowling found the book easy to write, finishing it just a year after she began writing it. The book sold 68,000 copies in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom and since has sold over three million in the country.[5] The book won the 1999 Whitbread Children's Book Award, the Bram Stoker Award, and the 2000 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel and was short-listed for other awards, including the Hugo.\n\n\nThe film adaptation of the novel was released in 2004, grossing more than $796 million and earning critical acclaim. Video games loosely based on *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nWhile Harry is living with the Dursleys, Aunt Marge comes to visit. When he and his late parents are insulted by Marge, an angry Harry accidentally inflates her. Harry packs up his stuff and leaves the house, choosing to spend the last weeks of summer at the Leaky Cauldron inn in London. While there, Harry is warned that a former follower of Voldemort, named Sirius Black, is seeking him out after having escaped from the wizard prison, Azkaban.\n\n\nAt Hogwarts, the guards of Azkaban, known as the Dementors, patrol the school looking for Black. Harry is unusually affected by their presence, and asks help from Remus Lupin, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, in learning to repel them. Lupin teaches Harry the incredibly difficult Patronus charm, but Harry is able to produce a full-bodied Patronus to fight off the Dementors. Meanwhile, Black is reported to have been sighted in the village of Hogsmeade, close to Hogwarts. \n\n\nHarry is given a secret map by Fred and George Weasley, which reveals everyone inside the castle and its grounds. Harry uses it to sneak into Hogsmeade without permission. Hiding inside a pub, he overhears a conversation in which he learns that Black is actually his godfather, and that he killed his own best friend, Peter Pettigrew, while also betraying Harry's father, James, to Voldemort. \n\n\nHarry, Ron and Hermione visit Hagrid at his hut, and are surprised to find Ron's missing pet rat, Scabbers, hiding there. As they walk back to the castle with Scabbers, Ron is attacked by a large dog. The dog drags Ron into a secret tunnel and disappears, coming out on the other side, inside the Shrieking Shack in Hogsmeade. The dog is revealed to be Black in his Animagus form. \n\n\nHarry and Hermione reach the Shack, followed by Lupin, who spots them on Harry's map. Lupin disarms Harry, then explains why he believes Black to be innocent. Black claims that the crimes attributed to him were actually committed by Pettigrew, who escaped suspicion by faking his own death. Pettigrew is also an Animagus, and has been hiding as Ron's rat Scabbers this whole time. Harry suggests handing Pettigrew over to the Dementors. \n\n\nWhile walking back to the castle, the full moon suddenly emerges and Lupin, secretly a werewolf, starts transforming. Black turns into the dog to protect the others, and Pettigrew escapes amid the chaos. Harry, Hermione and Black are accosted by Dementors, and Black ends up being captured.\n\n\nWhile Black is held captive inside a tower in Hogwarts, Dumbledore confirms with Harry and Hermione that he is indeed innocent. He instructs them to save Black, by going back in time and setting him free, before he is handed over to the Dementors. Using a Time Turner, which Hermione has had since the beginning of the year to get to all her classes, they travel back a few hours. Present-day Harry saves his past self, and the past versions of Hermione and Black from Dementors using a Patronus. He then allows Black to be captured by Snape, before using Hagrid's hippogriff, Buckbeak, to release him from the tower and escape. \n\n\nThe next day, Lupin is forced to resign as his secret identity as a werewolf is now known to the school. Harry is upset at not spending more time with his godfather, Black, but Dumbledore asks him to take comfort in having saved his life. On the train journey back to London, Harry receives a letter from Black, who also sends a replacement pet owl for Ron.\n\n\n\n## Publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n### Pre-release history[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* is the third book in the *Harry Potter* series. The first, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, was published by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997 and the second, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was published on 2 July 1998.[6] Rowling started to write the *Prisoner of Azkaban* the day after she finished *The Chamber of Secrets*.[7] Rowling said in 2004 that *Prisoner of Azkaban* was \"the best writing experience I ever had...I was in a very comfortable place writing (number) three. Immediate financial worries were over, and press attention wasn't yet by any means excessive\".[8]\n\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nGregory Maguire wrote a review in *The New York Times* for *Prisoner of Azkaban*: in it he said, \"So far, in terms of plot, the books do nothing new, but they do it brilliantly...so far, so good.\"[9] In a newspaper review in *The New York Times*, it was said that \"'The Prisoner of Azkaban' may be the best 'Harry Potter' book yet\".[10] A reviewer for KidsReads said, \"This crisply-paced fantasy will leave you hungry for the four additional Harry books that J.K. Rowling is working on. Harry's third year is a charm. Don't miss it.\"[11] *Kirkus Reviews* did not give a starred review but said, \"a properly pulse-pounding climax...The main characters and the continuing story both come along so smartly...that the book seems shorter than its page count: have readers clear their calendars if they are fans, or get out of the way if they are not.\"[12] Martha V. Parravano also gave a positive review for *The Horn Book Magazine*, calling it \"quite a good book.\"[13] In addition, a *Publishers Weekly* review said, \"Rowling's wit never flags, whether constructing the workings of the wizard world...or tossing off quick jokes...The Potter spell is holding strong\".[14]\n\n\nHowever, Anthony Holden, who was one of the judges against *Prisoner of Azkaban* for the Whitbread Award, was negative about the book, saying that the characters are \"all black-and-white\", and the \"story-lines are predictable, the suspense minimal, the sentimentality cloying every page\".[15]\n\n\nIn 2012 it was ranked number 12 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by *School Library Journal*.[16]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* won several awards, including the 1999 Booklist Editors' Choice Award,[17] the 1999 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers,[18] the 1999 FCBG Children's Book Award,[19] the 1999 Whitbread Book of the Year for children's books,[20] and the 2000 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel.[21] It was also nominated for the 2000 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the first in the series nominated, but lost to *A Deepness in the Sky*.[22] *Prisoner of Azkaban* additionally won the 2004 Indian Paintbrush Book Award[23] and the 2004 Colorado Blue Spruce Young Adult Book Award.[24] Additionally, it was named an American Library Association Notable Children's Book in 2000[25] as well as one of their Best Books for Young Adults.[26] As with the previous two books in the series, *Prisoner of Azkaban* won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize Gold Medal for children aged 9–11 and made the top of the New York Times Best Seller list.[27] In both cases, it was the last in the series to do so.[28] However, in the latter case, a Children's Best Sellers list was created just before the release of *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* in July 2000 in order to free up more room on the original list.[29] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 24 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[30]\n\n\n\n### Sales[edit]\n\n\n*Prisoner of Azkaban* sold more than 68,000 copies in the UK within three days of publication, which made it the fastest selling British book of the time.[5] The sales total by 2012 is said by *The Guardian* to be 3,377,906.[3]\n\n\n\n## Editions[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was released in hardcover in the UK on 8 July 1999[31] and in the US on 8 September.[31] The British paperback edition was released on 1 April 2000,[32] while the US paperback was released 1 October 2001.[33]\n\n\nBloomsbury additionally released an adult edition with a different cover design to the original, in paperback on 10 July 2004[34] and in hardcover in October 2004.[35] A hardcover special edition, featuring a green border and signature, was released on 8 July 1999.[31] In May 2004, Bloomsbury released a Celebratory Edition, with a blue and purple border.[36] On 1 November 2010, they released the 10th anniversary Signature edition illustrated by Clare Mellinsky and in July 2013 a new adult cover illustrated by Andrew Davidson, both these editions were designed by Webb & Webb Design Limited.[37]\n\n\nBeginning on 27 August 2013, Scholastic will release new covers for the paperback editions of *Harry Potter* in the United States to celebrate 15 years of the series.[38] The covers were designed by the author and illustrator Kazu Kibuishi.[39]\n\n\nAn illustrated version of *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was released on 3 October 2017, and was illustrated by Jim Kay, who illustrates the previous two instalments. This includes over 115 new illustrations and will be followed by Illustrated editions of the following 4 novels in the future.[40] Jim Kay announced on 6 October 2022 that he would not be illustrating the final two Harry Potter books and that his last work, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, would be released on 11 October 2022.[40]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)\n\nThe film version of *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was released in 2004 and was directed by Alfonso Cuarón from a screenplay by Steve Kloves.[41] The film débuted at number one at the box office and held that position for two weeks.[42] It made a total of $796.7 million worldwide,[43] which made it the second highest-grossing film of 2004 behind *Shrek 2*. However, among all eight entries in the *Harry Potter* franchise, *Prisoner of Azkaban* grossed the lowest; yet among critics and fans, the film is often cited as the best in the franchise – in large part due to Cuarón's stylistic influence.[44][45] The film ranks at number 471 in *Empire* magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.[46]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)\n\nThree unique video games by different developers were released in 2004 by Electronic Arts, loosely based on the book:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Developer | Release date | Platform | Genre | GameRankings | Metacritic |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| KnowWonder | 25 May 2004 | Microsoft Windows | Adventure/puzzle | 68.52%[47] | 67/100[48] |\n| Griptonite | Game Boy Advance | Role-playing game | 69.58%[49] | 69/100[50] |\n| EA UK | 29 May 2004 | GameCube | Action-adventure | 69.74%[51] | 67/100[52] |\n| PlayStation 2 | 72.59%[53] | 70/100[54] |\n| Xbox | 68.39%[55] | 67/100[56] |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by J.K.

K. Rowling and is the third in the *Harry Potter* series. The book follows Harry Potter, a young wizard, in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Along with friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry investigates Sirius Black, an escaped prisoner from Azkaban, the wizard prison, believed to be one of Lord Voldemort's old allies.\n\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom on 8 July 1999 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 8 September 1999 by Scholastic, Inc.[1][2][3][4] Rowling found the book easy to write, finishing it just a year after she began writing it. The book sold 68,000 copies in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom and since has sold over three million in the country.[5] The book won the 1999 Whitbread Children's Book Award, the Bram Stoker Award, and the 2000 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel and was short-listed for other awards, including the Hugo.\n\n\nThe film adaptation of the novel was released in 2004, grossing more than $796 million and earning critical acclaim. Video games loosely based on *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nWhile Harry is living with the Dursleys, Aunt Marge comes to visit. When he and his late parents are insulted by Marge, an angry Harry accidentally inflates her. Harry packs up his stuff and leaves the house, choosing to spend the last weeks of summer at the Leaky Cauldron inn in London. While there, Harry is warned that a former follower of Voldemort, named Sirius Black, is seeking him out after having escaped from the wizard prison, Azkaban.\n\n\nAt Hogwarts, the guards of Azkaban, known as the Dementors, patrol the school looking for Black. Harry is unusually affected by their presence, and asks help from Remus Lupin, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, in learning to repel them. Lupin teaches Harry the incredibly difficult Patronus charm, but Harry is able to produce a full-bodied Patronus to fight off the Dementors. Meanwhile, Black is reported to have been sighted in the village of Hogsmeade, close to Hogwarts. \n\n\nHarry is given a secret map by Fred and George Weasley, which reveals everyone inside the castle and its grounds. Harry uses it to sneak into Hogsmeade without permission. Hiding inside a pub, he overhears a conversation in which he learns that Black is actually his godfather, and that he killed his own best friend, Peter Pettigrew, while also betraying Harry's father, James, to Voldemort. \n\n\nHarry, Ron and Hermione visit Hagrid at his hut, and are surprised to find Ron's missing pet rat, Scabbers, hiding there. As they walk back to the castle with Scabbers, Ron is attacked by a large dog. The dog drags Ron into a secret tunnel and disappears, coming out on the other side, inside the Shrieking Shack in Hogsmeade. The dog is revealed to be Black in his Animagus form. \n\n\nHarry and Hermione reach the Shack, followed by Lupin, who spots them on Harry's map. Lupin disarms Harry, then explains why he believes Black to be innocent. Black claims that the crimes attributed to him were actually committed by Pettigrew, who escaped suspicion by faking his own death. Pettigrew is also an Animagus, and has been hiding as Ron's rat Scabbers this whole time. Harry suggests handing Pettigrew over to the Dementors. \n\n\nWhile walking back to the castle, the full moon suddenly emerges and Lupin, secretly a werewolf, starts transforming. Black turns into the dog to protect the others, and Pettigrew escapes amid the chaos. Harry, Hermione and Black are accosted by Dementors, and Black ends up being captured.\n\n\nWhile Black is held captive inside a tower in Hogwarts, Dumbledore confirms with Harry and Hermione that he is indeed innocent. He instructs them to save Black, by going back in time and setting him free, before he is handed over to the Dementors. Using a Time Turner, which Hermione has had since the beginning of the year to get to all her classes, they travel back a few hours. Present-day Harry saves his past self, and the past versions of Hermione and Black from Dementors using a Patronus. He then allows Black to be captured by Snape, before using Hagrid's hippogriff, Buckbeak, to release him from the tower and escape. \n\n\nThe next day, Lupin is forced to resign as his secret identity as a werewolf is now known to the school. Harry is upset at not spending more time with his godfather, Black, but Dumbledore asks him to take comfort in having saved his life. On the train journey back to London, Harry receives a letter from Black, who also sends a replacement pet owl for Ron.\n\n\n\n## Publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n### Pre-release history[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* is the third book in the *Harry Potter* series. The first, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, was published by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997 and the second, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was published on 2 July 1998.[6] Rowling started to write the *Prisoner of Azkaban* the day after she finished *The Chamber of Secrets*.[7] Rowling said in 2004 that *Prisoner of Azkaban* was \"the best writing experience I ever had...I was in a very comfortable place writing (number) three. Immediate financial worries were over, and press attention wasn't yet by any means excessive\".[8]\n\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nGregory Maguire wrote a review in *The New York Times* for *Prisoner of Azkaban*: in it he said, \"So far, in terms of plot, the books do nothing new, but they do it brilliantly...so far, so good.\"[9] In a newspaper review in *The New York Times*, it was said that \"'The Prisoner of Azkaban' may be the best 'Harry Potter' book yet\".[10] A reviewer for KidsReads said, \"This crisply-paced fantasy will leave you hungry for the four additional Harry books that J.K. Rowling is working on. Harry's third year is a charm. Don't miss it.\"[11] *Kirkus Reviews* did not give a starred review but said, \"a properly pulse-pounding climax...The main characters and the continuing story both come along so smartly...that the book seems shorter than its page count: have readers clear their calendars if they are fans, or get out of the way if they are not.\"[12] Martha V. Parravano also gave a positive review for *The Horn Book Magazine*, calling it \"quite a good book.\"[13] In addition, a *Publishers Weekly* review said, \"Rowling's wit never flags, whether constructing the workings of the wizard world...or tossing off quick jokes...The Potter spell is holding strong\".[14]\n\n\nHowever, Anthony Holden, who was one of the judges against *Prisoner of Azkaban* for the Whitbread Award, was negative about the book, saying that the characters are \"all black-and-white\", and the \"story-lines are predictable, the suspense minimal, the sentimentality cloying every page\".[15]\n\n\nIn 2012 it was ranked number 12 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by *School Library Journal*.[16]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* won several awards, including the 1999 Booklist Editors' Choice Award,[17] the 1999 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers,[18] the 1999 FCBG Children's Book Award,[19] the 1999 Whitbread Book of the Year for children's books,[20] and the 2000 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel.[21] It was also nominated for the 2000 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the first in the series nominated, but lost to *A Deepness in the Sky*.[22] *Prisoner of Azkaban* additionally won the 2004 Indian Paintbrush Book Award[23] and the 2004 Colorado Blue Spruce Young Adult Book Award.[24] Additionally, it was named an American Library Association Notable Children's Book in 2000[25] as well as one of their Best Books for Young Adults.[26] As with the previous two books in the series, *Prisoner of Azkaban* won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize Gold Medal for children aged 9–11 and made the top of the New York Times Best Seller list.[27] In both cases, it was the last in the series to do so.[28] However, in the latter case, a Children's Best Sellers list was created just before the release of *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* in July 2000 in order to free up more room on the original list.[29] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 24 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[30]\n\n\n\n### Sales[edit]\n\n\n*Prisoner of Azkaban* sold more than 68,000 copies in the UK within three days of publication, which made it the fastest selling British book of the time.[5] The sales total by 2012 is said by *The Guardian* to be 3,377,906.[3]\n\n\n\n## Editions[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was released in hardcover in the UK on 8 July 1999[31] and in the US on 8 September.[31] The British paperback edition was released on 1 April 2000,[32] while the US paperback was released 1 October 2001.[33]\n\n\nBloomsbury additionally released an adult edition with a different cover design to the original, in paperback on 10 July 2004[34] and in hardcover in October 2004.[35] A hardcover special edition, featuring a green border and signature, was released on 8 July 1999.[31] In May 2004, Bloomsbury released a Celebratory Edition, with a blue and purple border.[36] On 1 November 2010, they released the 10th anniversary Signature edition illustrated by Clare Mellinsky and in July 2013 a new adult cover illustrated by Andrew Davidson, both these editions were designed by Webb & Webb Design Limited.[37]\n\n\nBeginning on 27 August 2013, Scholastic will release new covers for the paperback editions of *Harry Potter* in the United States to celebrate 15 years of the series.[38] The covers were designed by the author and illustrator Kazu Kibuishi.[39]\n\n\nAn illustrated version of *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was released on 3 October 2017, and was illustrated by Jim Kay, who illustrates the previous two instalments. This includes over 115 new illustrations and will be followed by Illustrated editions of the following 4 novels in the future.[40] Jim Kay announced on 6 October 2022 that he would not be illustrating the final two Harry Potter books and that his last work, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, would be released on 11 October 2022.[40]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)\n\nThe film version of *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was released in 2004 and was directed by Alfonso Cuarón from a screenplay by Steve Kloves.[41] The film débuted at number one at the box office and held that position for two weeks.[42] It made a total of $796.7 million worldwide,[43] which made it the second highest-grossing film of 2004 behind *Shrek 2*. However, among all eight entries in the *Harry Potter* franchise, *Prisoner of Azkaban* grossed the lowest; yet among critics and fans, the film is often cited as the best in the franchise – in large part due to Cuarón's stylistic influence.[44][45] The film ranks at number 471 in *Empire* magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.[46]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)\n\nThree unique video games by different developers were released in 2004 by Electronic Arts, loosely based on the book:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Developer | Release date | Platform | Genre | GameRankings | Metacritic |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| KnowWonder | 25 May 2004 | Microsoft Windows | Adventure/puzzle | 68.52%[47] | 67/100[48] |\n| Griptonite | Game Boy Advance | Role-playing game | 69.58%[49] | 69/100[50] |\n| EA UK | 29 May 2004 | GameCube | Action-adventure | 69.74%[51] | 67/100[52] |\n| PlayStation 2 | 72.59%[53] | 70/100[54] |\n| Xbox | 68.39%[55] | 67/100[56] |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by J.K.

K. Rowling and the fourth novel in the *Harry Potter* series. It follows Harry Potter, a wizard in his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the mystery surrounding the entry of Harry's name into the Triwizard Tournament, in which he is forced to compete.\n\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic. In both countries, the release date was 8 July 2000. This was the first time a book in the series was published in both countries at the same time. The novel won a Hugo Award, the only *Harry Potter* novel to do so, in 2001. The book was adapted into a film, released worldwide on 18 November 2005, and a video game by Electronic Arts.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nOver the summer, the Weasleys invite Harry Potter to attend the Quidditch World Cup final, played between Bulgaria and the Republic of Ireland. The match ends in a victory for the Irish, but the campsite is attacked by Voldemort's former followers called the Death Eaters. Nobody is killed, but the Dark Mark is set off and found to have been cast by Barty Crouch's house-elf, Winky.\n\n\nHogwarts reopens and a new tournament is announced between three schools to compete for the Triwizard Cup. The other competing schools are Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Students excitedly await the start of the Tournament, which is declared open after the visiting teams arrive. The Goblet of Fire, a magical object tasked with selecting the champions, is unveiled. It names three champions from each of the schools, then selects Harry as a fourth champion, despite him being underage.\n\n\nThe students perceive Harry has cheated and turn on him. Rubeus Hagrid believes Harry's innocence and shows him the dragons involved in the First Task. Harry alerts Cedric Diggory, son of Amos Diggory, to the challenge and is helped by \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, ex-Auror and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, to prepare for the task. Using his superior flying skills, Harry gets past the dragon and retrieves a clue for the next task.\n\n\nA Yule Ball is announced and Harry must find a partner, as champions traditionally commence the opening dance. Harry and Ron Weasley struggle initially to get partners, but end up going with the \"prettiest girls in their year\" - Parvati and Padma Patil. Ron gets jealous seeing Hermione Granger with Viktor Krum, the Durmstrang champion, and spends the night arguing with her. Harry is sullen that Cho Chang is with Cedric, the other Hogwarts champion. \n\n\nThe Second Task requires saving a close friend or relative from the lake. Harry uses Gillyweed, given to him by Dobby, to breathe underwater. He rescues Ron from the lake, while also saving the Beauxbatons champion Fleur Delacour's sister out of fear that she will drown if Fleur cannot rescue her in time. After the task, Harry and Krum discover a seemingly mad Barty Crouch on the Hogwarts grounds, but he has vanished when they return.\n\n\nThe Quidditch field is prepared for the Third (and final) Task, and requires champions to overcome a maze filled with obstacles. Harry and Cedric succeed in reaching the centre, where the Triwizard Cup is placed. They touch it together, but are transported outside Hogwarts to a graveyard. Cedric believes this is part of the Task, but Harry gets alerted when his scar starts burning wildly. Wormtail arrives with Voldemort and kills Cedric with the latter's wand. He then uses Harry's blood to restore a frail Voldemort back to his full, physical body. Voldemort summons his Death Eaters and tries to kill Harry in front of them. He fails when his and Harry's wandstreams connect, in a rare phenomenon called Priori Incantatem. This causes a distraction by seeming to summon the ghosts of those that Voldermort’s wand has killed, including Harry’s parents, allowing Harry to escape back to Hogwarts using the Cup.\n\n\nAt Hogwarts, Moody pulls Harry into his office to question him and Harry realises that he is a Death Eater. He is saved by the arrival of Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape, who force Moody to reveal himself to be Barty Crouch Jr, a Death Eater formerly presumed dead. He had been imprisoned in Azkaban for supporting Voldemort and had escaped by leaving his mother in his place using Polyjuice Potion. Crouch Jr had then been placed under the Imperius Curse by his father until he had managed to break out of it during the Quidditch World Cup and cast the Dark Mark. He had then imprisoned the real Moody and impersonated him using more Polyjuice Potion. Arriving at Hogwarts, he made sure that Harry won the Tournament and was transported to the graveyard for Voldemort's ritual; his only wish is that Voldemort rise to the power he once had. His father had been placed under the Imperius Curse after Crouch Jr's escape, but had started to resist it and so had been killed. \n\n\nCrouch Jr is handed over to the Dementors. Harry recovers in the hospital wing, surrounded by Ron, Hermione and the Weasleys. He meets with Cedric's grieving parents, while Dumbledore makes plans to prepare the wizarding world for Voldemort's return. The school year ends and Harry returns to live with the Dursleys again for the summer.\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* is the fourth book in the *Harry Potter* series. The first, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, was published by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997. The second, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was published on 2 July 1998. The third, *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, followed on 8 July 1999.[1] *Goblet of Fire* is almost twice the size of the first three books (the paperback edition was 636 pages). Rowling stated that she \"knew from the beginning it would be the biggest of the first four.\" She said there needed to be a \"proper run-up\" for the conclusion and rushing the \"complex plot\" could confuse readers. She also stated that \"everything is on a bigger scale,\" which was symbolic, as Harry's horizons widened both literally and metaphorically as he grew up. She also wanted to explore more of the magical world.[2]\n\n\nUntil the official title's announcement on 27 June 2000, the book was called by its working title, \"*Harry Potter IV*\". Previously, in April, the publisher had listed it as *Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament*. However,[3] J. K. Rowling expressed her indecision about the title in an *Entertainment Weekly* interview.\n\"I changed my mind twice on what [the title] was. The working title had got out — *Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament*. Then I changed *Doomspell* to *Triwizard Tournament*. Then I was teetering between *Goblet of Fire* and *Triwizard Tournament*. In the end, I preferred *Goblet of Fire* because it's got that kind of *cup of destiny* feel about it, which is the theme of the book.\"[2]\n\n\nRowling mentioned that she originally wrote a Weasley relative named Malfalda, who, according to Rowling, \"was the daughter of the 'second cousin who's a stockbroker' mentioned in *Philosopher's Stone*. This stockbroker had been very rude to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley in the past, but now he and his (Muggle) wife had inconveniently produced a witch, they came back to the Weasleys asking for their help in introducing her to wizarding society before she starts at Hogwarts.\"[4] Malfalda was supposed to be a Slytherin and was to fill in the Rita Skeeter subplot, but she was eventually removed because \"there were obvious limitations to what an eleven-year-old closeted at school could discover.\" Rowling considered Rita Skeeter to be \"much more flexible.\"[4] Rowling also admitted that the fourth book was the most difficult to write at the time because the Malfalda character also served as a giant plot hole, which she discovered halfway through writing.[2]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\nJeff Jensen, who interviewed Rowling for *Entertainment Weekly* in 2000, pointed out that bigotry is a big theme in the *Harry Potter* novels and *Goblet of Fire* in particular. He mentioned how Voldemort and his followers are prejudiced against Muggles and how, in *Goblet of Fire,* Hermione forms a group to liberate Hogwarts' house-elves who have \"been indentured servants so long they lack desire for anything else.\"[2] When asked why she explored this theme, Rowling replied,\n\n\n\n\n> Because bigotry is probably the thing I detest most. All forms of intolerance, the whole idea of *that which is different from me is necessarily evil.* I really like to explore the idea that difference is equal and good. But there's another idea that I like to explore, too. Oppressed groups are not, generally speaking, people who stand firmly together – no, sadly, they kind of subdivide among themselves and fight like hell. That's human nature, so that's what you see here. This world of wizards and witches, they're already ostracized, and then within themselves, they've formed a loathsome pecking order.[2]\n> \n> \n\n\nShe also commented that she did not feel this was too \"heavy\" for children, as it was one of those things that a \"huge number of children at that age start to think about.\"[2]\n\n\n\n## Publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n### UK/US release[edit]\n\n\n*Goblet of Fire* was the first book in the Harry Potter series to be released in the United States on the same date as the United Kingdom, on 8 July 2000, strategically on a Saturday so children did not have to worry about school conflicting with buying the book.[1] It had a combined first-printing of over five million copies.[1] It was given a record-breaking print run of 3.9 million. Three million copies of the book were sold over the first weekend in the US alone.[5] FedEx dispatched more than 9,000 trucks and 100 planes to fulfil book deliveries.[6] The pressure in editing caused a mistake which shows Harry's father emerging first from Voldemort's wand; however, as confirmed in *Prisoner of Azkaban*, James died first, so then Harry's mother ought to have come out first.[7] This was corrected in later editions.[8]\n\n\n\n#### Launch publicity[edit]\n\n\nTo publicise the book, a special train named *Hogwarts Express* was organised by Bloomsbury, and run from King's Cross to Perth, carrying J.K. Rowling, a consignment of books for her to sign and sell, also representatives of Bloomsbury and the press. The book was launched on 8 July 2000, on platform 1 at King's Cross – which had been given \"Platform 9+3⁄4\" signs for the occasion – following which the train departed. En route it called at Didcot Railway Centre, Kidderminster, the Severn Valley Railway, Crewe (overnight stop), Manchester, Bradford, York, the National Railway Museum (overnight stop), Newcastle, Edinburgh, arriving at Perth on 11 July.[9] The locomotive was *West Country* class steam locomotive no. 34027 *Taw Valley*, which was specially repainted red for the tour; it later returned to its normal green livery (the repaints were requested and paid for by Bloomsbury). The coaches of the train included a sleeping car. A Diesel locomotive was coupled at the other end, for use when reversals were necessary, such as the first stage of the journey as far as Ferme Park, just south of Hornsey. The tour generated considerably more press interest than the launch of the film *Thomas and the Magic Railroad* which was premiered in London the same weekend.[10][11][12]\n\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* has received mostly positive reviews. In *The New York Times* Book Review, author Stephen King stated the *Goblet of Fire* was \"every bit as good as Potters 1 through 3\" and praised the humour and subplots, although he commented that \"there's also a moderately tiresome amount of adolescent squabbling...it's a teenage thing\".[13] *Kirkus Reviews* called it \"another grand tale of magic and mystery...and clicking along so smoothly that it seems shorter than it is\". However, they commented that it did tend to lag, especially at the end where two \"bad guys\" stopped the action to give extended explanations, and that the issues to be resolved in sequels would leave \"many readers, particularly American ones, uncomfortable\".[14] For *The Horn Book Magazine*, Martha V. Parravano gave a mixed review, saying \"some will find [it] wide-ranging, compellingly written, and absorbing; others, long, rambling, and tortuously fraught with adverbs\".[15] A *Publishers Weekly* review praised the book's \"red herrings, the artful clues and tricky surprises that disarm the most attentive audience\" and saying it \"might be her most thrilling yet.\"[16] Writing for *The New Yorker*, Joan Acocella noted that \"where the prior volumes moved like lightning, here the pace is slower, the energy more dispersed. At the same time, the tone becomes more grim.\"[17]\n\n\nKristin Lemmerman of CNN said that it is not great literature: 'Her prose has more in common with your typical beach-blanket fare and the beginning contained too much recap to introduce characters to new readers, although Rowling quickly gets back on track, introducing readers to a host of well-drawn new characters.'[18] Writing for Salon.com, Charles Taylor was generally positive about the change of mood and development of characters.[19] *Entertainment Weekly*'s reviewer Kristen Baldwin gave *Goblet of Fire* the grade of A−, praising the development of the characters as well as the many themes presented. However, she did worry that a shocking climax may be a \"nightmare factory\" for young readers.[20]\n\n\nIn 2012 it was ranked number 98 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by *School Library Journal*.[21]\n\n\n\n### Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* won several awards, including the 2001 Hugo Award for Best Novel.[22] It won the 2002 Indian Paintbrush Book Award, the third after *Philosopher's Stone* and *Prisoner of Azkaban*.[23] The novel also won an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Award for one of the best books, who claimed it was \"more intense than the first three books\".[24] In addition, *Entertainment Weekly* listed *Goblet of Fire* in second place on their list of *The New Classics: Books – The 100 best reads from 1983 to 2008*.[25] The Guardian ranked *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* #97 in its list of 100 Best Books of the 21st Century.[26]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)\n\n*Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* was adapted into a film, released worldwide on 18 November 2005, which was directed by Mike Newell and written by Steve Kloves. The film grossed $102.7 million for the opening weekend,[27] and eventually grossed $896 million worldwide.[28] The film was also nominated for Best Art Direction at the 78th Academy Awards.[29]\n\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (video game)\n\nIt was also made into a video game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation Portable by Electronic Arts. It was released just before the film.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"A Potter timeline for muggles\". *Toronto Star*. 14 July 2007.

K. Rowling and the fourth novel in the *Harry Potter* series. It follows Harry Potter, a wizard in his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the mystery surrounding the entry of Harry's name into the Triwizard Tournament, in which he is forced to compete.\n\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic. In both countries, the release date was 8 July 2000. This was the first time a book in the series was published in both countries at the same time. The novel won a Hugo Award, the only *Harry Potter* novel to do so, in 2001. The book was adapted into a film, released worldwide on 18 November 2005, and a video game by Electronic Arts.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nOver the summer, the Weasleys invite Harry Potter to attend the Quidditch World Cup final, played between Bulgaria and the Republic of Ireland. The match ends in a victory for the Irish, but the campsite is attacked by Voldemort's former followers called the Death Eaters. Nobody is killed, but the Dark Mark is set off and found to have been cast by Barty Crouch's house-elf, Winky.\n\n\nHogwarts reopens and a new tournament is announced between three schools to compete for the Triwizard Cup. The other competing schools are Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Students excitedly await the start of the Tournament, which is declared open after the visiting teams arrive. The Goblet of Fire, a magical object tasked with selecting the champions, is unveiled. It names three champions from each of the schools, then selects Harry as a fourth champion, despite him being underage.\n\n\nThe students perceive Harry has cheated and turn on him. Rubeus Hagrid believes Harry's innocence and shows him the dragons involved in the First Task. Harry alerts Cedric Diggory, son of Amos Diggory, to the challenge and is helped by \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, ex-Auror and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, to prepare for the task. Using his superior flying skills, Harry gets past the dragon and retrieves a clue for the next task.\n\n\nA Yule Ball is announced and Harry must find a partner, as champions traditionally commence the opening dance. Harry and Ron Weasley struggle initially to get partners, but end up going with the \"prettiest girls in their year\" - Parvati and Padma Patil. Ron gets jealous seeing Hermione Granger with Viktor Krum, the Durmstrang champion, and spends the night arguing with her. Harry is sullen that Cho Chang is with Cedric, the other Hogwarts champion. \n\n\nThe Second Task requires saving a close friend or relative from the lake. Harry uses Gillyweed, given to him by Dobby, to breathe underwater. He rescues Ron from the lake, while also saving the Beauxbatons champion Fleur Delacour's sister out of fear that she will drown if Fleur cannot rescue her in time. After the task, Harry and Krum discover a seemingly mad Barty Crouch on the Hogwarts grounds, but he has vanished when they return.\n\n\nThe Quidditch field is prepared for the Third (and final) Task, and requires champions to overcome a maze filled with obstacles. Harry and Cedric succeed in reaching the centre, where the Triwizard Cup is placed. They touch it together, but are transported outside Hogwarts to a graveyard. Cedric believes this is part of the Task, but Harry gets alerted when his scar starts burning wildly. Wormtail arrives with Voldemort and kills Cedric with the latter's wand. He then uses Harry's blood to restore a frail Voldemort back to his full, physical body. Voldemort summons his Death Eaters and tries to kill Harry in front of them. He fails when his and Harry's wandstreams connect, in a rare phenomenon called Priori Incantatem. This causes a distraction by seeming to summon the ghosts of those that Voldermort’s wand has killed, including Harry’s parents, allowing Harry to escape back to Hogwarts using the Cup.\n\n\nAt Hogwarts, Moody pulls Harry into his office to question him and Harry realises that he is a Death Eater. He is saved by the arrival of Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape, who force Moody to reveal himself to be Barty Crouch Jr, a Death Eater formerly presumed dead. He had been imprisoned in Azkaban for supporting Voldemort and had escaped by leaving his mother in his place using Polyjuice Potion. Crouch Jr had then been placed under the Imperius Curse by his father until he had managed to break out of it during the Quidditch World Cup and cast the Dark Mark. He had then imprisoned the real Moody and impersonated him using more Polyjuice Potion. Arriving at Hogwarts, he made sure that Harry won the Tournament and was transported to the graveyard for Voldemort's ritual; his only wish is that Voldemort rise to the power he once had. His father had been placed under the Imperius Curse after Crouch Jr's escape, but had started to resist it and so had been killed. \n\n\nCrouch Jr is handed over to the Dementors. Harry recovers in the hospital wing, surrounded by Ron, Hermione and the Weasleys. He meets with Cedric's grieving parents, while Dumbledore makes plans to prepare the wizarding world for Voldemort's return. The school year ends and Harry returns to live with the Dursleys again for the summer.\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* is the fourth book in the *Harry Potter* series. The first, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, was published by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997. The second, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was published on 2 July 1998. The third, *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, followed on 8 July 1999.[1] *Goblet of Fire* is almost twice the size of the first three books (the paperback edition was 636 pages). Rowling stated that she \"knew from the beginning it would be the biggest of the first four.\" She said there needed to be a \"proper run-up\" for the conclusion and rushing the \"complex plot\" could confuse readers. She also stated that \"everything is on a bigger scale,\" which was symbolic, as Harry's horizons widened both literally and metaphorically as he grew up. She also wanted to explore more of the magical world.[2]\n\n\nUntil the official title's announcement on 27 June 2000, the book was called by its working title, \"*Harry Potter IV*\". Previously, in April, the publisher had listed it as *Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament*. However,[3] J. K. Rowling expressed her indecision about the title in an *Entertainment Weekly* interview.\n\"I changed my mind twice on what [the title] was. The working title had got out — *Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament*. Then I changed *Doomspell* to *Triwizard Tournament*. Then I was teetering between *Goblet of Fire* and *Triwizard Tournament*. In the end, I preferred *Goblet of Fire* because it's got that kind of *cup of destiny* feel about it, which is the theme of the book.\"[2]\n\n\nRowling mentioned that she originally wrote a Weasley relative named Malfalda, who, according to Rowling, \"was the daughter of the 'second cousin who's a stockbroker' mentioned in *Philosopher's Stone*. This stockbroker had been very rude to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley in the past, but now he and his (Muggle) wife had inconveniently produced a witch, they came back to the Weasleys asking for their help in introducing her to wizarding society before she starts at Hogwarts.\"[4] Malfalda was supposed to be a Slytherin and was to fill in the Rita Skeeter subplot, but she was eventually removed because \"there were obvious limitations to what an eleven-year-old closeted at school could discover.\" Rowling considered Rita Skeeter to be \"much more flexible.\"[4] Rowling also admitted that the fourth book was the most difficult to write at the time because the Malfalda character also served as a giant plot hole, which she discovered halfway through writing.[2]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\nJeff Jensen, who interviewed Rowling for *Entertainment Weekly* in 2000, pointed out that bigotry is a big theme in the *Harry Potter* novels and *Goblet of Fire* in particular. He mentioned how Voldemort and his followers are prejudiced against Muggles and how, in *Goblet of Fire,* Hermione forms a group to liberate Hogwarts' house-elves who have \"been indentured servants so long they lack desire for anything else.\"[2] When asked why she explored this theme, Rowling replied,\n\n\n\n\n> Because bigotry is probably the thing I detest most. All forms of intolerance, the whole idea of *that which is different from me is necessarily evil.* I really like to explore the idea that difference is equal and good. But there's another idea that I like to explore, too. Oppressed groups are not, generally speaking, people who stand firmly together – no, sadly, they kind of subdivide among themselves and fight like hell. That's human nature, so that's what you see here. This world of wizards and witches, they're already ostracized, and then within themselves, they've formed a loathsome pecking order.[2]\n> \n> \n\n\nShe also commented that she did not feel this was too \"heavy\" for children, as it was one of those things that a \"huge number of children at that age start to think about.\"[2]\n\n\n\n## Publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n### UK/US release[edit]\n\n\n*Goblet of Fire* was the first book in the Harry Potter series to be released in the United States on the same date as the United Kingdom, on 8 July 2000, strategically on a Saturday so children did not have to worry about school conflicting with buying the book.[1] It had a combined first-printing of over five million copies.[1] It was given a record-breaking print run of 3.9 million. Three million copies of the book were sold over the first weekend in the US alone.[5] FedEx dispatched more than 9,000 trucks and 100 planes to fulfil book deliveries.[6] The pressure in editing caused a mistake which shows Harry's father emerging first from Voldemort's wand; however, as confirmed in *Prisoner of Azkaban*, James died first, so then Harry's mother ought to have come out first.[7] This was corrected in later editions.[8]\n\n\n\n#### Launch publicity[edit]\n\n\nTo publicise the book, a special train named *Hogwarts Express* was organised by Bloomsbury, and run from King's Cross to Perth, carrying J.K. Rowling, a consignment of books for her to sign and sell, also representatives of Bloomsbury and the press. The book was launched on 8 July 2000, on platform 1 at King's Cross – which had been given \"Platform 9+3⁄4\" signs for the occasion – following which the train departed. En route it called at Didcot Railway Centre, Kidderminster, the Severn Valley Railway, Crewe (overnight stop), Manchester, Bradford, York, the National Railway Museum (overnight stop), Newcastle, Edinburgh, arriving at Perth on 11 July.[9] The locomotive was *West Country* class steam locomotive no. 34027 *Taw Valley*, which was specially repainted red for the tour; it later returned to its normal green livery (the repaints were requested and paid for by Bloomsbury). The coaches of the train included a sleeping car. A Diesel locomotive was coupled at the other end, for use when reversals were necessary, such as the first stage of the journey as far as Ferme Park, just south of Hornsey. The tour generated considerably more press interest than the launch of the film *Thomas and the Magic Railroad* which was premiered in London the same weekend.[10][11][12]\n\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* has received mostly positive reviews. In *The New York Times* Book Review, author Stephen King stated the *Goblet of Fire* was \"every bit as good as Potters 1 through 3\" and praised the humour and subplots, although he commented that \"there's also a moderately tiresome amount of adolescent squabbling...it's a teenage thing\".[13] *Kirkus Reviews* called it \"another grand tale of magic and mystery...and clicking along so smoothly that it seems shorter than it is\". However, they commented that it did tend to lag, especially at the end where two \"bad guys\" stopped the action to give extended explanations, and that the issues to be resolved in sequels would leave \"many readers, particularly American ones, uncomfortable\".[14] For *The Horn Book Magazine*, Martha V. Parravano gave a mixed review, saying \"some will find [it] wide-ranging, compellingly written, and absorbing; others, long, rambling, and tortuously fraught with adverbs\".[15] A *Publishers Weekly* review praised the book's \"red herrings, the artful clues and tricky surprises that disarm the most attentive audience\" and saying it \"might be her most thrilling yet.\"[16] Writing for *The New Yorker*, Joan Acocella noted that \"where the prior volumes moved like lightning, here the pace is slower, the energy more dispersed. At the same time, the tone becomes more grim.\"[17]\n\n\nKristin Lemmerman of CNN said that it is not great literature: 'Her prose has more in common with your typical beach-blanket fare and the beginning contained too much recap to introduce characters to new readers, although Rowling quickly gets back on track, introducing readers to a host of well-drawn new characters.'[18] Writing for Salon.com, Charles Taylor was generally positive about the change of mood and development of characters.[19] *Entertainment Weekly*'s reviewer Kristen Baldwin gave *Goblet of Fire* the grade of A−, praising the development of the characters as well as the many themes presented. However, she did worry that a shocking climax may be a \"nightmare factory\" for young readers.[20]\n\n\nIn 2012 it was ranked number 98 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by *School Library Journal*.[21]\n\n\n\n### Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* won several awards, including the 2001 Hugo Award for Best Novel.[22] It won the 2002 Indian Paintbrush Book Award, the third after *Philosopher's Stone* and *Prisoner of Azkaban*.[23] The novel also won an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Award for one of the best books, who claimed it was \"more intense than the first three books\".[24] In addition, *Entertainment Weekly* listed *Goblet of Fire* in second place on their list of *The New Classics: Books – The 100 best reads from 1983 to 2008*.[25] The Guardian ranked *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* #97 in its list of 100 Best Books of the 21st Century.[26]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)\n\n*Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* was adapted into a film, released worldwide on 18 November 2005, which was directed by Mike Newell and written by Steve Kloves. The film grossed $102.7 million for the opening weekend,[27] and eventually grossed $896 million worldwide.[28] The film was also nominated for Best Art Direction at the 78th Academy Awards.[29]\n\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (video game)\n\nIt was also made into a video game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation Portable by Electronic Arts. It was released just before the film.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"A Potter timeline for muggles\". *Toronto Star*. 14 July 2007.

K. Rowling and the fifth novel in the *Harry Potter* series. It follows Harry Potter's struggles through his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, including the surreptitious return of the antagonist Lord Voldemort, O.W.L. exams, and an obstructive Ministry of Magic. The novel was published on 21 June 2003 by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom, Scholastic in the United States, and Raincoast in Canada. It sold five million copies in the first 24 hours of publication.[1]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* won several awards, including the American Library Association Best Book Award for Young Adults in 2003. The book was also made into a 2007 film, and a video game by Electronic Arts.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nDuring the summer, Harry Potter is frustrated by his friends' non-communication and with Dumbledore barring him from helping combat a newly-resurgent Lord Voldemort. One evening, Dementors attack him and cousin Dudley, but Harry fends them off using the Patronus Charm. Later, Order of the Phoenix members arrive at the Dursley house to evacuate Harry. They whisk him off to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, Sirius Black's family home, which is now the Order's headquarters. Ron and Hermione are there and tell Harry that the Order is a secret organisation that Dumbledore created to fight Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Harry wants to join but is still too young. \n\n\nThe Ministry of Magic, under Cornelius Fudge, attempt to malign Harry for stating that Voldemort has returned. Harry is also charged with performing underage magic while with a Muggle, but is exonerated and returns to Hogwarts. Dolores Umbridge, a senior Ministry employee, is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She initiates strict rules and a textbook-only curriculum and forbids the students from practicing defensive spells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione form a secret student Defense group called Dumbledore's Army. The group secretly meets in the Room of Requirement to practice under Harry's instruction.\n\n\nOne night, Harry dreams that Arthur Weasley is attacked by Voldemort's snake, Nagini. His vision is true, and Arthur is found seriously injured at the Ministry. Dumbledore realises that Harry's and Voldemort's minds are connected, and he orders Professor Snape to teach Harry Occlumency, a skill to close one's mind against others. Umbridge is tipped-off about Dumbledore's Army; to prevent Harry's expulsion, Dumbledore claims responsibility for forming the group. To avoid arrest, he goes into hiding. Umbridge is appointed headmistress, though she is magically barred from entering Dumbledore's tower. She begins enacting strict rules and regulations and attempts to dismiss Professor Trelawney.\n\n\nHarry's Occlumency lessons go poorly. During his Ordinary Wizarding Level exams, he envisions Voldemort torturing Sirius in the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry. Harry attempts to contact Sirius at Grimmauld Place, using the Floo Network in Umbridge's office, but she catches and interrogates him, threatening to use the Cruciatus Curse on him. Hermione intervenes by concocting a story that leads them into the Forbidden Forest. Umbridge provokes the centaurs, who take her captive. \n\n\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna fly to the Ministry to save Sirius, but he is not in the Department of Mysteries. Instead, the room in his vision has shelves filled with glass spheres, one of which bears Harry's and Voldemort's names. Harry picks it up and is immediately surrounded by Death Eaters. Lucius Malfoy reveals that Harry was lured there by a fake vision from Voldemort, and that he wishes to hear the prophecy contained in the glass sphere. He asks Harry for the sphere, but Harry refuses. The Hogwarts group fight the Death Eaters and evade them. Order of the Phoenix members (tipped off by Professor Snape) arrive and battle the Death Eaters. Neville accidentally drops the prophecy sphere, breaking it. Later during the battle, Bellatrix Lestrange kills Sirius. \n\n\nHarry chases Bellatrix into the atrium. Voldemort appears and tries to kill Harry, but Dumbledore appears and thwarts him. Fudge and other Ministry of Magic employees arrive on the scene and witness Voldemort just before he escapes. In his office, Dumbledore tells Harry the prophecy was made by Professor Trelawney, who predicted the birth of a child with power against Voldemort. This caused Voldemort to pursue Harry's parents, and is why he targets Harry. Overwhelmed by the prophecy and mourning Sirius' death, Harry grows sullen, although the wizarding community now believes and respects him. Supported by his friends, Harry is able to endure another summer with the Dursleys.\n\n\n\n## Publication and release[edit]\n\n\n*Potter* fans waited three years between the releases of the fourth and fifth books.[2][3] Before the release of the fifth book, 200 million copies of the first four books had already been sold and translated into 55 languages in 200 countries.[4] As the series was already a global phenomenon, the book forged new pre-order records, with thousands of people queuing outside book stores on 20 June 2003 to secure copies at midnight.[4] Despite the security, thousands of copies were stolen from an Earlestown, Merseyside warehouse on 15 June 2003.[5]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* was met with mostly positive reviews and received several awards. In 2004, the book was cited as an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults and as an American Library Association Notable Book.[6][7] It also received the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio 2004 Gold Medal, along with several other awards.[8] Rowling was praised for her imagination by *USA Today* writer Deirdre Donahue.[9]\n*The New York Times* writer John Leonard praised the novel, saying \"*The Order of the Phoenix* starts slow, gathers speed and then skateboards, with somersaults, to its furious conclusion....As Harry gets older, Rowling gets better.\"[10] However, he also criticised \"the one-note Draco Malfoy\" and the predictable Lord Voldemort.[10]\n\n\n\n### Predecessors and sequels[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* is the fifth book in the *Harry Potter* series.[2] The first book in the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,* was first published by Bloomsbury in 1997 with an initial print-run of 500 copies in hardback, 300 of which were distributed to libraries. By the end of 1997, the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9-to-11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize.[11][12][13] The second novel, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was published in the UK on 2 July 1998. The third novel, *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, was published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999.[12][13] The fourth novel, *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, was published 8 July 2000, simultaneously by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.[14] The fifth novel, *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, is the longest book in the series, yet it is the second-shortest film at 2 hours 18 minutes.[15]\n\n\nAfter the publishing of *Order of the Phoenix*, the sixth book of the series, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, was published on 16 July 2005 and sold 9 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release.[1][16] The seventh and final novel, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, was published 21 July 2007.[17] The book sold 11 million copies within 24 hours of its release: 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.[16]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)\n\nIn 2007, *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* was released in a film version directed by David Yates and written by Michael Goldenberg. The film was produced by David Heyman's company, Heyday Films, alongside David Barron. The budget was reportedly between £75 and 100 million (US$150–200 million),[18][19] and it became the unadjusted eleventh-highest-grossing film of all time and a critical and commercial success.[20] The film opened to a worldwide 5-day opening of $333 million, the third best of all time, and grossed $940 million total, second to *Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End* for the greatest total of 2007.[21][22]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)\n\nA video game adaptation of the book and film versions of *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* was made for Microsoft Windows, PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, PSP, Nintendo DS, Wii, Game Boy Advance, and Mac OS X.[23] It was released on 25 June 2007 in the U.S., 28 June 2007 in Australia, and 29 June 2007 in the UK and Europe for PlayStation 3, PSP, PlayStation 2, Windows, and 3 July 2007 for most other platforms.[24] The games were published by Electronic Arts.[25]\n\n\nThe book is also depicted in the 2011 video game *Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7*.\n\n\n\n## Translations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter in translation\n\nThe first official foreign translation of the book appeared in Vietnamese on 21 July 2003, when the first of twenty-two instalments was released. The first official European translation appeared in Serbia and Montenegro in Serbian by the official publisher *Narodna Knjiga* in early September 2003. Other translations appeared later (e.g. in November 2003 in Dutch and German). The English-language version has topped the bestseller list in France, whereas in Germany and the Netherlands, an unofficial distributed translation process was started on the internet.[26]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Novels portal\n\n\n* Religious debates over the Harry Potter series\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"July date for Harry Potter book\". *BBC News*. 21 December 2004.

One evening, Dementors attack him and cousin Dudley, but Harry fends them off using the Patronus Charm. Later, Order of the Phoenix members arrive at the Dursley house to evacuate Harry.

Ron and Hermione are there and tell Harry that the Order is a secret organisation that Dumbledore created to fight Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Harry wants to join but is still too young. \n\n\nThe Ministry of Magic, under Cornelius Fudge, attempt to malign Harry for stating that Voldemort has returned. Harry is also charged with performing underage magic while with a Muggle, but is exonerated and returns to Hogwarts. Dolores Umbridge, a senior Ministry employee, is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She initiates strict rules and a textbook-only curriculum and forbids the students from practicing defensive spells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione form a secret student Defense group called Dumbledore's Army. The group secretly meets in the Room of Requirement to practice under Harry's instruction.\n\n\nOne night, Harry dreams that Arthur Weasley is attacked by Voldemort's snake, Nagini. His vision is true, and Arthur is found seriously injured at the Ministry. Dumbledore realises that Harry's and Voldemort's minds are connected, and he orders Professor Snape to teach Harry Occlumency, a skill to close one's mind against others. Umbridge is tipped-off about Dumbledore's Army; to prevent Harry's expulsion, Dumbledore claims responsibility for forming the group. To avoid arrest, he goes into hiding. Umbridge is appointed headmistress, though she is magically barred from entering Dumbledore's tower. She begins enacting strict rules and regulations and attempts to dismiss Professor Trelawney.\n\n\nHarry's Occlumency lessons go poorly. During his Ordinary Wizarding Level exams, he envisions Voldemort torturing Sirius in the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry. Harry attempts to contact Sirius at Grimmauld Place, using the Floo Network in Umbridge's office, but she catches and interrogates him, threatening to use the Cruciatus Curse on him. Hermione intervenes by concocting a story that leads them into the Forbidden Forest. Umbridge provokes the centaurs, who take her captive. \n\n\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna fly to the Ministry to save Sirius, but he is not in the Department of Mysteries. Instead, the room in his vision has shelves filled with glass spheres, one of which bears Harry's and Voldemort's names. Harry picks it up and is immediately surrounded by Death Eaters. Lucius Malfoy reveals that Harry was lured there by a fake vision from Voldemort, and that he wishes to hear the prophecy contained in the glass sphere. He asks Harry for the sphere, but Harry refuses. The Hogwarts group fight the Death Eaters and evade them. Order of the Phoenix members (tipped off by Professor Snape) arrive and battle the Death Eaters. Neville accidentally drops the prophecy sphere, breaking it. Later during the battle, Bellatrix Lestrange kills Sirius. \n\n\nHarry chases Bellatrix into the atrium. Voldemort appears and tries to kill Harry, but Dumbledore appears and thwarts him. Fudge and other Ministry of Magic employees arrive on the scene and witness Voldemort just before he escapes. In his office, Dumbledore tells Harry the prophecy was made by Professor Trelawney, who predicted the birth of a child with power against Voldemort. This caused Voldemort to pursue Harry's parents, and is why he targets Harry. Overwhelmed by the prophecy and mourning Sirius' death, Harry grows sullen, although the wizarding community now believes and respects him. Supported by his friends, Harry is able to endure another summer with the Dursleys.\n\n\n\n## Publication and release[edit]\n\n\n*Potter* fans waited three years between the releases of the fourth and fifth books.[2][3] Before the release of the fifth book, 200 million copies of the first four books had already been sold and translated into 55 languages in 200 countries.[4] As the series was already a global phenomenon, the book forged new pre-order records, with thousands of people queuing outside book stores on 20 June 2003 to secure copies at midnight.[4] Despite the security, thousands of copies were stolen from an Earlestown, Merseyside warehouse on 15 June 2003.[5]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* was met with mostly positive reviews and received several awards. In 2004, the book was cited as an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults and as an American Library Association Notable Book.[6][7] It also received the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio 2004 Gold Medal, along with several other awards.[8] Rowling was praised for her imagination by *USA Today* writer Deirdre Donahue.[9]\n*The New York Times* writer John Leonard praised the novel, saying \"*The Order of the Phoenix* starts slow, gathers speed and then skateboards, with somersaults, to its furious conclusion....As Harry gets older, Rowling gets better.\"[10] However, he also criticised \"the one-note Draco Malfoy\" and the predictable Lord Voldemort.[10]\n\n\n\n### Predecessors and sequels[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* is the fifth book in the *Harry Potter* series.[2] The first book in the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,* was first published by Bloomsbury in 1997 with an initial print-run of 500 copies in hardback, 300 of which were distributed to libraries. By the end of 1997, the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9-to-11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize.[11][12][13] The second novel, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was published in the UK on 2 July 1998. The third novel, *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, was published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999.[12][13] The fourth novel, *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, was published 8 July 2000, simultaneously by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.[14] The fifth novel, *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, is the longest book in the series, yet it is the second-shortest film at 2 hours 18 minutes.[15]\n\n\nAfter the publishing of *Order of the Phoenix*, the sixth book of the series, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, was published on 16 July 2005 and sold 9 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release.[1][16] The seventh and final novel, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, was published 21 July 2007.[17] The book sold 11 million copies within 24 hours of its release: 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.[16]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)\n\nIn 2007, *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* was released in a film version directed by David Yates and written by Michael Goldenberg. The film was produced by David Heyman's company, Heyday Films, alongside David Barron. The budget was reportedly between £75 and 100 million (US$150–200 million),[18][19] and it became the unadjusted eleventh-highest-grossing film of all time and a critical and commercial success.[20] The film opened to a worldwide 5-day opening of $333 million, the third best of all time, and grossed $940 million total, second to *Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End* for the greatest total of 2007.[21][22]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)\n\nA video game adaptation of the book and film versions of *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* was made for Microsoft Windows, PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, PSP, Nintendo DS, Wii, Game Boy Advance, and Mac OS X.[23] It was released on 25 June 2007 in the U.S., 28 June 2007 in Australia, and 29 June 2007 in the UK and Europe for PlayStation 3, PSP, PlayStation 2, Windows, and 3 July 2007 for most other platforms.[24] The games were published by Electronic Arts.[25]\n\n\nThe book is also depicted in the 2011 video game *Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7*.\n\n\n\n## Translations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter in translation\n\nThe first official foreign translation of the book appeared in Vietnamese on 21 July 2003, when the first of twenty-two instalments was released. The first official European translation appeared in Serbia and Montenegro in Serbian by the official publisher *Narodna Knjiga* in early September 2003. Other translations appeared later (e.g. in November 2003 in Dutch and German). The English-language version has topped the bestseller list in France, whereas in Germany and the Netherlands, an unofficial distributed translation process was started on the internet.[26]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Novels portal\n\n\n* Religious debates over the Harry Potter series\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"July date for Harry Potter book\". *BBC News*. 21 December 2004.

K. Rowling and the sixth and penultimate novel in the *Harry Potter* series. Set during Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, the novel explores the past of the boy wizard's nemesis, Lord Voldemort, and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor Albus Dumbledore.\n\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries. It sold almost seven million copies in the first 24 hours after its release,[1] a record eventually broken by its sequel, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*.[2] There were many controversies before and after it was published, including the right-to-read copies delivered before the release date in Canada. Reception to the novel was generally positive, and it won several awards and honours, including the 2006 British Book of the Year award.\n\n\nReviewers noted that the book had a darker tone than its predecessors, though it did contain some humour. Some considered the main themes love, death, trust, and redemption. The considerable character development of Harry and many other teenage characters also drew attention.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nNew Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, meets with the Muggle prime minister to discuss recent wizarding events affecting the non-magical world. Meanwhile, Harry, grieving his late godfather, Sirius Black, endures another summer at the Dursleys. Dumbledore unexpectedly arrives to escort Harry to the Weasleys' home. First, they visit retired Hogwarts professor Horace Slughorn, whom Dumbledore wants to resume his former post. Slughorn agrees only after meeting the famous Harry Potter. Elsewhere, Bellatrix Lestrange and her sister Narcissa Malfoy secretly seek out Severus Snape at his home. Narcissa asks Snape to make an Unbreakable Vow to protect her son, Draco, and to carry out a task, should he fail.\n\n\nWhile school shopping in Diagon Alley, Harry, Ron, and Hermione observe Draco suspiciously slipping into Knockturn Alley. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry, wearing his Invisibility Cloak, overhears Draco claim he may not return to Hogwarts the following year to instead, \"go on to better things.\" Harry suspects that Draco may have become a Death Eater. During the Welcome Feast, Slughorn is introduced as the new Potions teacher while Snape is now the Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor. Harry and Ron take Slughorn's advanced potions class. Harry finds a tattered potions textbook bearing the inscription, 'The Half-Blood Prince.' The book contains tips, as well as new spells, scribbled in the book margins that yield better results than the printed instructions. With it, Harry rises to the top of the class and wins a vial of Felix Felicis, a luck-enhancing potion. Hermione says Harry is cheating while Slughorn compares his potions skill to his mother, Lily.\n\n\nDumbledore begins tutoring Harry on Tom Riddle, aka Voldemort, to prepare him for their foretold battle. He shows Harry memories of Riddle's past, including his meeting young Riddle in an orphanage. One memory from Slughorn's early Hogwarts' days suddenly goes dark when Riddle utters the word, 'horcrux'. This memory has been altered, and Dumbledore tasks Harry with retrieving Slughorn's true one. To that end, Harry attends the Slug Club, an informal group of Slughorn's favourite students. Hermione and Ginny are also included, though Ron is excluded. \n\n\nHermione invites Ron to Slughorn's Christmas party, but he remains upset about her previous relationship with Viktor Krum and begins seeing Lavender Brown, inducing strong jealousy in Hermione. Harry takes Luna Lovegood to the party but leaves early to follow Draco Malfoy when he gatecrashes the event. Shortly after, Ron is poisoned drinking mead that Slughorn had intended as a gift for Dumbledore. Ron survives but while he is in the infirmary, Lavender breaks up with him when he favors Hermione. Also, Harry and Ginny become romantically involved.\n\n\nUsing the Felix Felicis potion, Harry successfully obtains Slughorn's unaltered memory. It reveals how Tom Riddle created six Horcruxes to become immortal. Horcruxes, magical objects encasing one's soul, are created with ancient dark magic. Two, Riddle's diary and a ring, have been destroyed, but Dumbledore believes four Horcruxes remain. \n\n\nDumbledore discovers another Horcrux location, and he and Harry journey to a remote cave. Inside, a Horcrux is hidden under protective enchantments in the middle of a lake. Dumbledore nearly dies retrieving a Locket Horcrux. Returning to Hogwarts, Dumbledore and Harry see the Dark Mark hovering above the Astronomy Tower. Atop the tower, they hear footsteps approaching. Dumbledore casts a protective spell on Harry, forcing him to watch helplessly when Draco arrives and disarms Dumbledore. A distressed Draco reveals that Voldemort ordered him to murder Dumbledore. He is unable to follow through, however; Snape arrives and casts the Killing Curse at Dumbledore. \n\n\nReleased from Dumbledore's protection, Harry pursues Snape, firing a curse at him. Snape easily deflects it. Snape taunts Harry for using his own spell against him and reveals that he is the Half-Blood Prince. Snape escapes with Draco through the ensuing battle between Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore's lifeless body is found at the base of Astronomy Tower. Representatives from all wizarding races attend his funeral. Later, Harry discovers that the Locket Horcrux is fake, switched by someone whose initials are, R.A.B. Ron and Hermione vow to help Harry find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes. To protect Ginny, Harry ends their relationship.\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\n### Franchise[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* is the sixth book in the Harry Potter series.[3] The first book in the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, was first published by Bloomsbury in 1997, with an initial print-run of 500 copies in hardback, 300 of which were distributed to libraries.[4] By the end of 1997, the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9- to 11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize.[5] The second book, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was initially published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999.[6][7] *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was then published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999.[6][7] *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.[8] *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, the longest novel in the Harry Potter series, was released 21 June 2003.[9] After the publishing of *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, the seventh and final novel, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, was released 21 July 2007.[10] The book sold 11 million copies within 24 hours of its release: 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.[11]\n\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\n![J. K. Rowling, author of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, crouches. She is wearing a blue dress under a grey jacket.](image)Rowling spent years planning *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*.\nRowling stated that she had *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* \"planned for years,\" but she spent two months revisiting her plan before she began writing the story's first draft. This was a lesson learned after she did not check the plan for *Goblet of Fire* and had to rewrite an entire third of the book.[12] She started writing the book before her second child, David, was born, but she took a break to care for him.[13] The first chapter, \"The Other Minister\", which features meetings between the Muggle Prime Minister, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, and his successor, Rufus Scrimgeour, was a concept Rowling tried to start in *Philosopher's Stone*, *Prisoner of Azkaban*, and *Order of the Phoenix*, but she found \"it finally works\" in *Half-Blood Prince*.[14] She stated that she was \"seriously upset\" writing the end of the book, although *Goblet of Fire* was the hardest to write.[15] When asked if she liked the book, she responded, \"I like it better than I liked *Goblet*, *Phoenix* or *Chamber* when I finished them. Book six does what I wanted it to do and even if nobody else likes it (and some won't), I know it will remain one of my favourites of the series. Ultimately you have to please yourself before you please anyone else!\"[16]\n\n\nRowling revealed the title of *Half-Blood Prince* on her website on 24 June 2004.[17] This was the title she had once considered for the second book, *Chamber of Secrets*, though she decided the information disclosed belonged later on in the story.[18] On 21 December 2004, she announced she had finished writing it, along with the release date of 16 July.[19][20] Bloomsbury unveiled the cover on 8 March 2005.[21]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nThe record-breaking publication of *Half-Blood Prince* was accompanied by controversy. In May 2005, bookmakers in the UK suspended bets on which main character would die in the book amid fears of insider knowledge. A number of high-value bets were made on the death of Albus Dumbledore, many coming from the town of Bungay where it was believed the books were being printed at the time. Betting was later reopened.[22] Additionally, in response to Greenpeace's campaign on using forest friendly paper for big-name authors, Bloomsbury published the book on 30% recycled paper.[23]\n\n\n\n### Right-to-read controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn early July 2005, a Real Canadian Superstore in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada, accidentally sold fourteen copies of *The Half-Blood Prince* before the authorised release date. The Canadian publisher, Raincoast Books, obtained an injunction from the Supreme Court of British Columbia that prohibited the purchasers from reading the books before the official release date or discussing the contents.[24] Purchasers were offered Harry Potter T-shirts and autographed copies of the book if they returned their copies before 16 July.[24]\n\n\nOn 15 July, less than twelve hours before the book went on sale in the Eastern time zone, Raincoast warned *The Globe and Mail* newspaper that publishing a review from a Canada-based writer at midnight, as the paper had promised, would be seen as a violation of the trade secret injunction. The injunction sparked a number of news articles alleging that the injunction had restricted fundamental rights. Canadian law professor Michael Geist posted commentary on his blog.[25] Richard Stallman called for a boycott and requested the publisher issue an apology.[26] *The Globe and Mail* published a review from two UK-based writers in its 16 July edition and posted the Canadian writer's review on its website at 9:00 that morning.[27] Commentary was also provided on the Raincoast website.[28]\n\n\n\n## Style and themes[edit]\n\n\nSome reviewers noted that *Half-Blood Prince* contained a darker tone than the previous *Potter* novels. *The Christian Science Monitor*'s reviewer Yvonne Zipp argued the first half contained a lighter tone to soften the unhappy ending.[29] *The Boston Globe* reviewer Liz Rosenberg wrote, \"lightness [is] slimmer than ever in this darkening series...[there is] a new charge of gloom and darkness. I felt depressed by the time I was two-thirds of the way through.\" She also compared the setting to Charles Dickens's depictions of London as it was \"brooding, broken, gold-lit, as living a character as any other.\"[30] Christopher Paolini called the darker tone \"disquieting\" because it was so different from the earlier books.[31] Liesl Schillinger, a contributor to *The New York Times* book review, also noted that *Half-Blood Prince* was \"far darker\" but \"leavened with humor, romance and snappy dialogue.\" She suggested a connection to the 11 September attacks, as the later, darker novels were written after that event.[32] David Kipen, a critic of the *San Francisco Chronicle,* considered the \"darkness as a sign of our paranoid times\" and singled out curfews and searches that were part of the tightened security at Hogwarts as resemblances to our world.[33]\n\n\nJulia Keller, a critic for the *Chicago Tribune*, highlighted the humour found in the novel and claimed it to be the success of the *Harry Potter* saga. She acknowledged that \"the books are dark and scary in places\" but \"no darkness in *Half-Blood Prince*...is so immense that it cannot be rescued by a snicker or a smirk.\" She considered that Rowling was suggesting difficult times can be worked through with imagination, hope, and humour and compared this concept to works such as Madeleine L'Engle's *A Wrinkle in Time* and Kenneth Grahame's *The Wind in the Willows*.[34]\n\n\nRosenberg wrote that the two main themes of *Half-Blood Prince* were love and death and praised Rowling's \"affirmation of their central position in human lives.\" She considered love to be represented in several forms: the love of parent to child, teacher to student, and the romances that developed between the main characters.[30] Zipp noted trust and redemption to be themes promising to continue in the final book, which she thought \"would add a greater layer of nuance and complexity to some characters who could sorely use it.\"[29] Deepti Hajela also pointed out Harry's character development, that he was \"no longer a boy wizard; he's a young man, determined to seek out and face a young man's challenges.\"[35] Paolini had similar views, claiming, \"the children have changed...they act like real teenagers.\"[31]\n\n\n\n## Publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* was met with positive reviews. Liesl Schillinger of *The New York Times* praised the novel's various themes and suspenseful ending. However, she considered Rowling's gift \"not so much for language as for characterisation and plotting.\"[32] *Kirkus Reviews* said it \"will leave readers pleased, amused, excited, scared, infuriated, delighted, sad, surprised, thoughtful and likely wondering where Voldemort has got to, since he appears only in flashbacks.\" They considered Rowling's \"wry wit\" to turn into \"outright merriment\" but called the climax \"tragic, but not uncomfortably shocking.\"[36] Yvonne Zipp of *The Christian Science Monitor* praised the way Rowling evolved Harry into a teenager and how the plot threads found as far back as *Chamber of Secrets* came into play. On the other hand, she noted it \"gets a little exposition-heavy in spots,\" and older readers may have seen the ending coming.[29]\n\n\n*The Boston Globe* correspondent Liz Rosenberg wrote, \"The book bears the mark of genius on every page\" and praised the imagery and darker tone of the book, considering that the series could be crossing over from fantasy to horror.[30] The Associated Press writer Deepti Hajela praised the newfound emotional tones and ageing Harry to the point at which \"younger fans may find [the series] has grown up too much.\"[35] Emily Green, a staff writer for the *Los Angeles Times*, was generally positive about the book but was concerned whether young children could handle the material.[37] Cultural critic Julia Keller of the *Chicago Tribune* called it the \"most eloquent and substantial addition to the series thus far\" and considered the key to the success of the *Potter* novels to be humour.[34]\n\n\n\n### Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* won several awards, including the 2006 British Book of the Year Award[38] and the 2006 Royal Mail Award for Scottish Children's Books for ages 8–12 in its native United Kingdom.[39] In the United States, the American Library Association listed it among its 2006 Best Books for Young Adults.[40] It won both the 2005 reader-voted Quill Awards for Best Book of the Year and Best Children's Book.[41][42] It also won the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Seal for notable book.[43]\n\n\n\n### Sales[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fans wait outside a Borders in Newark, Delaware for the midnight release of the book.\nBefore publication, 1.4 million pre-orders were placed for *Half-Blood Prince* on Amazon.com, breaking the record held by the previous novel, *Order of the Phoenix*, with 1.3 million.[44] The initial print run for *Half-Blood Prince* was a record-breaking 10.8 million.[45] Within the first 24 hours after release, the book sold 9 million copies worldwide: 2 million in the UK and about 6.9 million in the US,[46] which prompted Scholastic to rush an additional 2.7 million copies into print.[47] Within the first nine weeks of publication, 11 million copies of the US edition were reported to have been sold.[48] The US audiobook, read by Jim Dale, set sales records with 165,000 sold over two days, besting the adaptation of *Order of the Phoenix* by twenty percent.[49]\n\n\n\n## Translations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harry Potter in translation\n\n*Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* was published simultaneously in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.[50] Along with the rest of the books in the Harry Potter series, it was eventually translated into 67 languages.[51] However, because of high security surrounding the manuscript, translators did not get to start on translating *Half-Blood Prince* until its English release date, and the earliest were not expected to be released until the fall of 2005.[52] In Germany, a group of \"hobby translators\" translated the book via the internet less than two days after release, long before German translator Klaus Fritz could translate and publish the book.[53]\n\n\n\n## Editions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Reproductions of artwork by Mary GrandPré *(pictured)* were available with the Scholastic Deluxe Edition.\nSince its wide hardcover release on 16 July 2005, *Half-Blood Prince* was released as a paperback on 23 June 2006 in the UK.[54] Two days later on 25 July, the paperback edition was released in Canada[55] and the US, where it had an initial print run of 2 million copies.[56] To celebrate the release of the American paperback edition, Scholastic held a six-week sweepstakes event in which participants in an online poll were entered to win prizes.[57] Simultaneous to the original hardcover release was the UK adult edition that featured a new cover[58] and was also released as a paperback on 23 June.[59] Also released on 16 July was the Scholastic \"Deluxe Edition,\" which featured reproductions of Mary GrandPré's artwork and had a print run of about 100,000 copies.[60] Bloomsbury later released a paperback \"Special Edition\" on 6 July 2009[61] and a \"Signature Edition\" paperback on 1 November 2010.[62]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)\n\nThe film adaptation of the sixth book was originally scheduled to be released on 21 November 2008 but was changed to 15 July 2009.[63][64] Directed by David Yates, the screenplay was adapted by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman and David Barron.[65] The film grossed over $934 million worldwide,[66] which made it the second-highest-grossing film of 2009 worldwide[67] and the fifteenth-highest of all time.[68] Additionally, *Half-Blood Prince* gained an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography.[69][70]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)\n\nA video game adaptation of the book was developed by EA Bright Light Studio and published by Electronic Arts in 2009. The game was available on the Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Xbox 360, and macOS platforms.\n\n\nThe book was also adapted in the 2011 video game Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"11 Million Copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Sold in First Nine Weeks | Scholastic Media Room\". *mediaroom.scholastic.com*.

K. Rowling and the sixth and penultimate novel in the *Harry Potter* series. Set during Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, the novel explores the past of the boy wizard's nemesis, Lord Voldemort, and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor Albus Dumbledore.\n\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries. It sold almost seven million copies in the first 24 hours after its release,[1] a record eventually broken by its sequel, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*.[2] There were many controversies before and after it was published, including the right-to-read copies delivered before the release date in Canada. Reception to the novel was generally positive, and it won several awards and honours, including the 2006 British Book of the Year award.\n\n\nReviewers noted that the book had a darker tone than its predecessors, though it did contain some humour. Some considered the main themes love, death, trust, and redemption. The considerable character development of Harry and many other teenage characters also drew attention.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nNew Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, meets with the Muggle prime minister to discuss recent wizarding events affecting the non-magical world. Meanwhile, Harry, grieving his late godfather, Sirius Black, endures another summer at the Dursleys. Dumbledore unexpectedly arrives to escort Harry to the Weasleys' home. First, they visit retired Hogwarts professor Horace Slughorn, whom Dumbledore wants to resume his former post. Slughorn agrees only after meeting the famous Harry Potter. Elsewhere, Bellatrix Lestrange and her sister Narcissa Malfoy secretly seek out Severus Snape at his home. Narcissa asks Snape to make an Unbreakable Vow to protect her son, Draco, and to carry out a task, should he fail.\n\n\nWhile school shopping in Diagon Alley, Harry, Ron, and Hermione observe Draco suspiciously slipping into Knockturn Alley. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry, wearing his Invisibility Cloak, overhears Draco claim he may not return to Hogwarts the following year to instead, \"go on to better things.\" Harry suspects that Draco may have become a Death Eater. During the Welcome Feast, Slughorn is introduced as the new Potions teacher while Snape is now the Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor. Harry and Ron take Slughorn's advanced potions class. Harry finds a tattered potions textbook bearing the inscription, 'The Half-Blood Prince.' The book contains tips, as well as new spells, scribbled in the book margins that yield better results than the printed instructions. With it, Harry rises to the top of the class and wins a vial of Felix Felicis, a luck-enhancing potion. Hermione says Harry is cheating while Slughorn compares his potions skill to his mother, Lily.\n\n\nDumbledore begins tutoring Harry on Tom Riddle, aka Voldemort, to prepare him for their foretold battle. He shows Harry memories of Riddle's past, including his meeting young Riddle in an orphanage. One memory from Slughorn's early Hogwarts' days suddenly goes dark when Riddle utters the word, 'horcrux'. This memory has been altered, and Dumbledore tasks Harry with retrieving Slughorn's true one. To that end, Harry attends the Slug Club, an informal group of Slughorn's favourite students. Hermione and Ginny are also included, though Ron is excluded. \n\n\nHermione invites Ron to Slughorn's Christmas party, but he remains upset about her previous relationship with Viktor Krum and begins seeing Lavender Brown, inducing strong jealousy in Hermione. Harry takes Luna Lovegood to the party but leaves early to follow Draco Malfoy when he gatecrashes the event. Shortly after, Ron is poisoned drinking mead that Slughorn had intended as a gift for Dumbledore. Ron survives but while he is in the infirmary, Lavender breaks up with him when he favors Hermione. Also, Harry and Ginny become romantically involved.\n\n\nUsing the Felix Felicis potion, Harry successfully obtains Slughorn's unaltered memory. It reveals how Tom Riddle created six Horcruxes to become immortal. Horcruxes, magical objects encasing one's soul, are created with ancient dark magic. Two, Riddle's diary and a ring, have been destroyed, but Dumbledore believes four Horcruxes remain. \n\n\nDumbledore discovers another Horcrux location, and he and Harry journey to a remote cave. Inside, a Horcrux is hidden under protective enchantments in the middle of a lake. Dumbledore nearly dies retrieving a Locket Horcrux. Returning to Hogwarts, Dumbledore and Harry see the Dark Mark hovering above the Astronomy Tower. Atop the tower, they hear footsteps approaching. Dumbledore casts a protective spell on Harry, forcing him to watch helplessly when Draco arrives and disarms Dumbledore. A distressed Draco reveals that Voldemort ordered him to murder Dumbledore. He is unable to follow through, however; Snape arrives and casts the Killing Curse at Dumbledore. \n\n\nReleased from Dumbledore's protection, Harry pursues Snape, firing a curse at him. Snape easily deflects it. Snape taunts Harry for using his own spell against him and reveals that he is the Half-Blood Prince. Snape escapes with Draco through the ensuing battle between Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore's lifeless body is found at the base of Astronomy Tower. Representatives from all wizarding races attend his funeral. Later, Harry discovers that the Locket Horcrux is fake, switched by someone whose initials are, R.A.B. Ron and Hermione vow to help Harry find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes. To protect Ginny, Harry ends their relationship.\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\n### Franchise[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* is the sixth book in the Harry Potter series.[3] The first book in the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, was first published by Bloomsbury in 1997, with an initial print-run of 500 copies in hardback, 300 of which were distributed to libraries.[4] By the end of 1997, the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9- to 11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize.[5] The second book, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was initially published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999.[6][7] *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was then published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999.[6][7] *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.[8] *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, the longest novel in the Harry Potter series, was released 21 June 2003.[9] After the publishing of *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, the seventh and final novel, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, was released 21 July 2007.[10] The book sold 11 million copies within 24 hours of its release: 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.[11]\n\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\n![J. K. Rowling, author of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, crouches. She is wearing a blue dress under a grey jacket.](image)Rowling spent years planning *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*.\nRowling stated that she had *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* \"planned for years,\" but she spent two months revisiting her plan before she began writing the story's first draft. This was a lesson learned after she did not check the plan for *Goblet of Fire* and had to rewrite an entire third of the book.[12] She started writing the book before her second child, David, was born, but she took a break to care for him.[13] The first chapter, \"The Other Minister\", which features meetings between the Muggle Prime Minister, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, and his successor, Rufus Scrimgeour, was a concept Rowling tried to start in *Philosopher's Stone*, *Prisoner of Azkaban*, and *Order of the Phoenix*, but she found \"it finally works\" in *Half-Blood Prince*.[14] She stated that she was \"seriously upset\" writing the end of the book, although *Goblet of Fire* was the hardest to write.[15] When asked if she liked the book, she responded, \"I like it better than I liked *Goblet*, *Phoenix* or *Chamber* when I finished them. Book six does what I wanted it to do and even if nobody else likes it (and some won't), I know it will remain one of my favourites of the series. Ultimately you have to please yourself before you please anyone else!\"[16]\n\n\nRowling revealed the title of *Half-Blood Prince* on her website on 24 June 2004.[17] This was the title she had once considered for the second book, *Chamber of Secrets*, though she decided the information disclosed belonged later on in the story.[18] On 21 December 2004, she announced she had finished writing it, along with the release date of 16 July.[19][20] Bloomsbury unveiled the cover on 8 March 2005.[21]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nThe record-breaking publication of *Half-Blood Prince* was accompanied by controversy. In May 2005, bookmakers in the UK suspended bets on which main character would die in the book amid fears of insider knowledge. A number of high-value bets were made on the death of Albus Dumbledore, many coming from the town of Bungay where it was believed the books were being printed at the time. Betting was later reopened.[22] Additionally, in response to Greenpeace's campaign on using forest friendly paper for big-name authors, Bloomsbury published the book on 30% recycled paper.[23]\n\n\n\n### Right-to-read controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn early July 2005, a Real Canadian Superstore in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada, accidentally sold fourteen copies of *The Half-Blood Prince* before the authorised release date. The Canadian publisher, Raincoast Books, obtained an injunction from the Supreme Court of British Columbia that prohibited the purchasers from reading the books before the official release date or discussing the contents.[24] Purchasers were offered Harry Potter T-shirts and autographed copies of the book if they returned their copies before 16 July.[24]\n\n\nOn 15 July, less than twelve hours before the book went on sale in the Eastern time zone, Raincoast warned *The Globe and Mail* newspaper that publishing a review from a Canada-based writer at midnight, as the paper had promised, would be seen as a violation of the trade secret injunction. The injunction sparked a number of news articles alleging that the injunction had restricted fundamental rights. Canadian law professor Michael Geist posted commentary on his blog.[25] Richard Stallman called for a boycott and requested the publisher issue an apology.[26] *The Globe and Mail* published a review from two UK-based writers in its 16 July edition and posted the Canadian writer's review on its website at 9:00 that morning.[27] Commentary was also provided on the Raincoast website.[28]\n\n\n\n## Style and themes[edit]\n\n\nSome reviewers noted that *Half-Blood Prince* contained a darker tone than the previous *Potter* novels. *The Christian Science Monitor*'s reviewer Yvonne Zipp argued the first half contained a lighter tone to soften the unhappy ending.[29] *The Boston Globe* reviewer Liz Rosenberg wrote, \"lightness [is] slimmer than ever in this darkening series...[there is] a new charge of gloom and darkness. I felt depressed by the time I was two-thirds of the way through.\" She also compared the setting to Charles Dickens's depictions of London as it was \"brooding, broken, gold-lit, as living a character as any other.\"[30] Christopher Paolini called the darker tone \"disquieting\" because it was so different from the earlier books.[31] Liesl Schillinger, a contributor to *The New York Times* book review, also noted that *Half-Blood Prince* was \"far darker\" but \"leavened with humor, romance and snappy dialogue.\" She suggested a connection to the 11 September attacks, as the later, darker novels were written after that event.[32] David Kipen, a critic of the *San Francisco Chronicle,* considered the \"darkness as a sign of our paranoid times\" and singled out curfews and searches that were part of the tightened security at Hogwarts as resemblances to our world.[33]\n\n\nJulia Keller, a critic for the *Chicago Tribune*, highlighted the humour found in the novel and claimed it to be the success of the *Harry Potter* saga. She acknowledged that \"the books are dark and scary in places\" but \"no darkness in *Half-Blood Prince*...is so immense that it cannot be rescued by a snicker or a smirk.\" She considered that Rowling was suggesting difficult times can be worked through with imagination, hope, and humour and compared this concept to works such as Madeleine L'Engle's *A Wrinkle in Time* and Kenneth Grahame's *The Wind in the Willows*.[34]\n\n\nRosenberg wrote that the two main themes of *Half-Blood Prince* were love and death and praised Rowling's \"affirmation of their central position in human lives.\" She considered love to be represented in several forms: the love of parent to child, teacher to student, and the romances that developed between the main characters.[30] Zipp noted trust and redemption to be themes promising to continue in the final book, which she thought \"would add a greater layer of nuance and complexity to some characters who could sorely use it.\"[29] Deepti Hajela also pointed out Harry's character development, that he was \"no longer a boy wizard; he's a young man, determined to seek out and face a young man's challenges.\"[35] Paolini had similar views, claiming, \"the children have changed...they act like real teenagers.\"[31]\n\n\n\n## Publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* was met with positive reviews. Liesl Schillinger of *The New York Times* praised the novel's various themes and suspenseful ending. However, she considered Rowling's gift \"not so much for language as for characterisation and plotting.\"[32] *Kirkus Reviews* said it \"will leave readers pleased, amused, excited, scared, infuriated, delighted, sad, surprised, thoughtful and likely wondering where Voldemort has got to, since he appears only in flashbacks.\" They considered Rowling's \"wry wit\" to turn into \"outright merriment\" but called the climax \"tragic, but not uncomfortably shocking.\"[36] Yvonne Zipp of *The Christian Science Monitor* praised the way Rowling evolved Harry into a teenager and how the plot threads found as far back as *Chamber of Secrets* came into play. On the other hand, she noted it \"gets a little exposition-heavy in spots,\" and older readers may have seen the ending coming.[29]\n\n\n*The Boston Globe* correspondent Liz Rosenberg wrote, \"The book bears the mark of genius on every page\" and praised the imagery and darker tone of the book, considering that the series could be crossing over from fantasy to horror.[30] The Associated Press writer Deepti Hajela praised the newfound emotional tones and ageing Harry to the point at which \"younger fans may find [the series] has grown up too much.\"[35] Emily Green, a staff writer for the *Los Angeles Times*, was generally positive about the book but was concerned whether young children could handle the material.[37] Cultural critic Julia Keller of the *Chicago Tribune* called it the \"most eloquent and substantial addition to the series thus far\" and considered the key to the success of the *Potter* novels to be humour.[34]\n\n\n\n### Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* won several awards, including the 2006 British Book of the Year Award[38] and the 2006 Royal Mail Award for Scottish Children's Books for ages 8–12 in its native United Kingdom.[39] In the United States, the American Library Association listed it among its 2006 Best Books for Young Adults.[40] It won both the 2005 reader-voted Quill Awards for Best Book of the Year and Best Children's Book.[41][42] It also won the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Seal for notable book.[43]\n\n\n\n### Sales[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fans wait outside a Borders in Newark, Delaware for the midnight release of the book.\nBefore publication, 1.4 million pre-orders were placed for *Half-Blood Prince* on Amazon.com, breaking the record held by the previous novel, *Order of the Phoenix*, with 1.3 million.[44] The initial print run for *Half-Blood Prince* was a record-breaking 10.8 million.[45] Within the first 24 hours after release, the book sold 9 million copies worldwide: 2 million in the UK and about 6.9 million in the US,[46] which prompted Scholastic to rush an additional 2.7 million copies into print.[47] Within the first nine weeks of publication, 11 million copies of the US edition were reported to have been sold.[48] The US audiobook, read by Jim Dale, set sales records with 165,000 sold over two days, besting the adaptation of *Order of the Phoenix* by twenty percent.[49]\n\n\n\n## Translations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harry Potter in translation\n\n*Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* was published simultaneously in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.[50] Along with the rest of the books in the Harry Potter series, it was eventually translated into 67 languages.[51] However, because of high security surrounding the manuscript, translators did not get to start on translating *Half-Blood Prince* until its English release date, and the earliest were not expected to be released until the fall of 2005.[52] In Germany, a group of \"hobby translators\" translated the book via the internet less than two days after release, long before German translator Klaus Fritz could translate and publish the book.[53]\n\n\n\n## Editions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Reproductions of artwork by Mary GrandPré *(pictured)* were available with the Scholastic Deluxe Edition.\nSince its wide hardcover release on 16 July 2005, *Half-Blood Prince* was released as a paperback on 23 June 2006 in the UK.[54] Two days later on 25 July, the paperback edition was released in Canada[55] and the US, where it had an initial print run of 2 million copies.[56] To celebrate the release of the American paperback edition, Scholastic held a six-week sweepstakes event in which participants in an online poll were entered to win prizes.[57] Simultaneous to the original hardcover release was the UK adult edition that featured a new cover[58] and was also released as a paperback on 23 June.[59] Also released on 16 July was the Scholastic \"Deluxe Edition,\" which featured reproductions of Mary GrandPré's artwork and had a print run of about 100,000 copies.[60] Bloomsbury later released a paperback \"Special Edition\" on 6 July 2009[61] and a \"Signature Edition\" paperback on 1 November 2010.[62]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)\n\nThe film adaptation of the sixth book was originally scheduled to be released on 21 November 2008 but was changed to 15 July 2009.[63][64] Directed by David Yates, the screenplay was adapted by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman and David Barron.[65] The film grossed over $934 million worldwide,[66] which made it the second-highest-grossing film of 2009 worldwide[67] and the fifteenth-highest of all time.[68] Additionally, *Half-Blood Prince* gained an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography.[69][70]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)\n\nA video game adaptation of the book was developed by EA Bright Light Studio and published by Electronic Arts in 2009. The game was available on the Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Xbox 360, and macOS platforms.\n\n\nThe book was also adapted in the 2011 video game Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"11 Million Copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Sold in First Nine Weeks | Scholastic Media Room\". *mediaroom.scholastic.com*.

K. Rowling and the seventh and final novel in the *Harry Potter* series. It was released on 21 July 2007 in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury Publishing, in the United States by Scholastic, and in Canada by Raincoast Books. The novel chronicles the events directly following *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* (2005) and the final confrontation between the wizards Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.\n\n\n*Deathly Hallows* shattered sales records upon release, surpassing marks set by previous titles of the *Harry Potter* series. It holds the Guinness World Record for most novels sold within 24 hours of release, with 8.3 million sold in the US and 2.65 million in the UK.[1][2] Reception to the book was generally positive, and the book won the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award, and the American Library Association named it the \"Best Book for Young Adults\". A play, *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, was written by Jack Thorne, and based on an original story written by J. K. Rowling, John Tiffany, and Thorne, premiering at the Palace Theatre in London on 30 July 2016. Rowling has referred to the play as \"the eighth Harry Potter story\", and is set nineteen years after the events of the Deathly Hallows, effectively picking up where the epilogue of the seventh book ended.\n\n\nA film adaptation of the novel was released in two parts: *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1* in November 2010 and *Part 2* in July 2011.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\nThroughout the six previous novels, Harry Potter has struggled with the difficulties of adolescence along with being famous as the only person ever to survive the Killing Curse. The curse was cast by Tom Riddle, better known as Lord Voldemort, an evil wizard who murdered Harry's parents and attempted to kill Harry as a baby, due to a prophecy which claimed Harry would be able to stop him. As an orphan, Harry was placed in the care of his Muggle (non-magical) relatives Petunia Dursley and Vernon Dursley, with their son Dudley Dursley.\n\n\nIn *The Philosopher's Stone*, Harry re-enters the wizarding world at age 11 and enrols in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He befriends fellow students Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and is mentored by the school's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. He also meets Professor Severus Snape, who dislikes and bullies him. Harry fights Voldemort several times while at school as the wizard tries to regain a physical form. In *Goblet of Fire*, Harry is mysteriously entered in the Triwizard Tournament and discovers it is a trap designed to allow the return of Voldemort to full strength. In *Order of the Phoenix*, Harry and several of his friends face off against Voldemort's followers, the Death Eaters. In *Half-Blood Prince*, Harry learns that Voldemort has divided his soul into parts, creating \"Horcruxes\" from various unknown objects to contain them. In this way, he has ensured his immortality as long as at least one Horcrux still exists.[3] Two of these are destroyed: a diary destroyed by Harry in *Chamber of Secrets* and a ring destroyed by Dumbledore shortly before the events of *Half-Blood Prince*. Dumbledore takes Harry along in an attempt to destroy a third Horcrux, Slytherin's locket. However, the Horcrux was taken by an unknown wizard, and upon their return, Dumbledore is ambushed and disarmed by Draco Malfoy. Draco cannot bring himself to kill Dumbledore, so Snape does it instead.\n\n\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\nHarry is about to turn seventeen and will lose his deceased mother's magical protection. Order of the Phoenix members relocate the Dursleys for their protection. Harry is being flown to The Burrow, with friends and allies acting as identical decoys. Death Eaters immediately attack, and, in the ensuing battle, \"Mad-Eye\" Moody and Hedwig are killed while George Weasley is wounded. Voldemort arrives to kill Harry, whose wand fends off the attack.\n\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione prepare to hunt down Voldemort's four remaining Horcruxes. Each is bequeathed an object from Dumbledore: a Golden Snitch for Harry, a Deluminator for Ron, and *The Tales of Beedle the Bard*, for Hermione. Harry is also bequeathed the Sword of Godric Gryffindor, but the Ministry claims it never belonged to Dumbledore. Death Eaters attack during Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding reception while the Ministry of Magic falls to Voldemort. The trio flee to 12 Grimmauld Place, Sirius Black's family home that was left to Harry.\n\n\nThey discover that Sirius's late brother, Regulus, was the mysterious R.A.B. who stole the Horcrux locket but died in the process. His house-elf Kreacher was unable to destroy the locket, which was later stolen by Mundungus Fletcher. Kreacher locates Fletcher, who says the locket was taken by Ministry official Dolores Umbridge. Infiltrating the Ministry, the trio steal the locket from Umbridge, but Grimmauld Place is compromised in their escape. They flee to the forest and are unable to destroy the locket and have no further leads. The locket's dark nature affects Ron, who abandons the group. Harry and Hermione learn about Dumbledore's past with dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald. They travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace. There they are attacked by Voldemort's snake, Nagini, who inhabited Bathilda Bagshot's corpse. They escape, but Harry's wand is badly damaged. One night, a doe Patronus guides Harry to a pond containing the Sword of Godric Gryffindor. When Harry tries to recover it, the locket tightens around his neck, nearly killing him. Ron, guided back by the Deluminator, saves him and destroys the locket Horcrux with the sword.\n\n\nIn Dumbledore's book, Hermione identifies a symbol also worn by Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius Lovegood. He tells them of the mythical Deathly Hallows: the Elder Wand, an unbeatable wand; the Resurrection Stone, which can summon the dead; and an Invisibility Cloak. Xenophilius fails to say that Luna is being held captive. He summons Death Eaters to capture the trio in exchange for his daughter's freedom, but they escape. They speculate that Dumbledore won the Elder Wand by defeating Grindelwald. Harry's Invisibility Cloak is the third Hallow, and his Snitch contains the Resurrection Stone.\n\n\nThe trio are captured and taken to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix tortures Hermione, believing they stole Gryffindor's sword from her Gringotts vault. With help from Dobby the house-elf, they escape to Bill and Fleur's seaside cottage, along with fellow prisoners, including Luna, Mr Ollivander, and the goblin Griphook. During the escape, Bellatrix fatally wounds Dobby, and Harry hand-digs the house-elf’s grave. Harry has a vision of Voldemort stealing the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb. The trio break into Bellatrix's vault, believing another Horcrux is there. With Griphook's help, they break in, retrieve Hufflepuff's cup, and escape, though Griphook steals Gryffindor's sword in the process. Harry has another vision that Voldemort has been informed of the heist and decides to check his Horcruxes. Harry sees that Nagini is a Horcrux, and another is hidden at Hogwarts.\n\n\nDumbledore's brother, Aberforth, helps the trio enter Hogwarts. Voldemort, alerted to Harry's whereabouts, mounts an assault on Hogwarts. The teachers and students mobilize to defend the school. Ron and Hermione destroy Hufflepuff's cup with basilisk fangs from the Chamber of Secrets and share an impulsive kiss. Harry discovers Ravenclaw's diadem is the Horcrux hidden there. The trio find it in the Room of Requirement but Draco, Crabbe and Goyle ambush them. Crabbe attacks with fiendfyre, but is unable to control it; the cursed fire kills him and destroys the diadem. Meanwhile, many allies die during Voldemort's assault, including Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, and Fred Weasley.\n\n\nThe Elder Wand resists Voldemort's commands. Believing that Snape, having killed Dumbledore, is its true master, he has Nagini attack him just as Harry arrives. Mortally wounded, Snape passes his memories to Harry. Harry views them in the Pensieve. The memories reveal that Snape loved Harry's mother and acted as a double agent against Voldemort in an attempt to protect her. He watched over the trio, conjuring the doe Patronus, influenced by his love for Lily, who also had a doe Patronus. Dumbledore was dying after mishandling the ring Horcrux and planned his \"murder\" at Snape's hands. Harry also learns he is an unintentional Horcrux, unbeknownst to Voldemort, and must die to render Voldemort mortal. Before surrendering himself, Harry instructs Neville Longbottom to kill Nagini. On the way, he uses the Resurrection Stone to reunite with his parents and other deceased loved ones. He drops the stone as he meets Voldemort, who casts the Killing Curse on him.\n\n\nHarry awakens in a dreamlike location resembling King's Cross where he is greeted by Dumbledore. Dumbledore explains that Voldemort's original Killing Curse left a soul fragment in Harry, causing their connection. The latest Killing Curse destroyed that soul fragment, allowing Harry to return to life or to \"go on\". Harry returns to life and feigns death. Voldemort calls for a truce at Hogwarts and demands their surrender. Neville, however, pulls Gryffindor's sword from the Sorting Hat and kills Nagini.\n\n\nThe battle resumes, with Molly Weasley killing Bellatrix. Harry reveals himself to Voldemort and engages him in a final battle. He explains the Elder Wand's loyalty transfers upon the defeat, not the killing of its former master. Draco, not Snape, had been the Elder Wand's master, having disarmed Dumbledore before Snape killed him. Having disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor, Harry now commands the Elder Wand. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse at Harry, but the spell rebounds, killing Voldemort. Before returning the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's tomb, Harry uses it to repair his old wand. He keeps his Invisibility Cloak and leaves the Resurrection Stone lost in the forest.\n\n\n\nEpilogue\nNineteen years later, the trio see their children off to Hogwarts. Harry and Ginny have three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. Ron and Hermione have two children, Rose and Hugo. Harry's godson Teddy Lupin, son of Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks, is found kissing Bill and Fleur's daughter Victoire; Draco and his wife are seeing off their son Scorpius. Albus is departing for his first year and worries he will be sorted into Slytherin. Harry reassures him, recounting Snape's bravery, and revealing the Sorting Hat could account for his wishes. As his scar has not hurt in nineteen years, the narrator concludes that \"all was well\".\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Franchise[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, the first book in the series, was published by Bloomsbury on 30 June 1997.[4] The second book, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* was published on 2 July 1998.[5] *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was then published a year later on 8 July 1999.[5] *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* was published on 8 July 2000.[6] *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* was published on 21 June 2003.[7] *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* was published on 16 July 2005, and sold 9 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release.[8][9]\n\n\n\n### Choice of title[edit]\n\n\nThe title of the book refers to three mythical objects featured in the story, collectively known as the \"Deathly Hallows\"—an unbeatable wand (the Elder Wand), a stone to bring the dead to life (the Resurrection Stone), and a cloak of invisibility. Shortly before releasing the title, J. K. Rowling announced that she had considered three titles for the book.[10][11] The final title was released to the public on 21 December 2006, via a special Christmas-themed hangman puzzle on Rowling's website, confirmed shortly afterwards by the book's publishers.[12] When asked during a live chat about the other titles she had been considering, Rowling mentioned *Harry Potter and the Elder Wand* and *Harry Potter and the Peverell Quest*.[10]\n\n\n\n### Rowling on finishing the book[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rowling completed the final chapters of *Deathly Hallows* in Room 552 of the Balmoral Hotel.\nRowling completed the book while staying at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh in January 2007, leaving a signed statement on a marble bust of Hermes in her room that reads \"J. K. Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in this room (552) on 11 January 2007\".[13] In a statement on her website, she said, \"I've never felt such a mixture of extreme emotions in my life, never dreamed I could feel simultaneously heartbroken and euphoric.\" She compared her mixed feelings to those expressed by Charles Dickens in the preface of the 1850 edition of *David Copperfield*, \"a two-years' imaginative task\". \"To which,\" she added, \"I can only sigh, try seventeen years, Charles\". She ended her message by saying \"*Deathly Hallows* is my favourite, and that is the most wonderful way to finish the series\".[14]\n\n\nWhen asked before publication about the forthcoming book, Rowling stated that she could not change the ending even if she wanted. \"These books have been plotted for such a long time, and for six books now, that they're all leading a certain direction. So, I really can't\".[15] She also commented that the final volume related closely to the previous book in the series, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, \"almost as though they are two-halves of the same novel\".[16] She has said that the last chapter of the book was written \"in something like 1990\", as part of her earliest work on the series.[17] Rowling also revealed she originally wrote the last words to be something like: 'Only those who he loved could see his lightning scar'\". Rowling changed this because she did not want people to think Voldemort would rise again and to say that Harry's mission was over.[18][19]\n\n\n\n## Major themes[edit]\n\n\n![A blonde woman with blue eyes has a red and white robe on over her dress is holding an honorary degree with her left hand.](image)J. K. Rowling has said that the main theme of the series is Harry dealing with death.\n### Death[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2006 interview, J. K. Rowling said that the main theme of the series is Harry dealing with death,[20] which was influenced by her mother's death in 1990, from multiple sclerosis.[18][20][21][22] Lev Grossman of *Time* stated that the main theme of the series was the overwhelming importance of continuing to love in the face of death.[23]\n\n\n\n### Living in a corrupted society[edit]\n\n\nAcademics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books, some more complex than others, and some including political subtexts. Themes such as normality, oppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series.[24] Similarly, the theme of making one's way through adolescence and \"going over one's most harrowing ordeals—and thus coming to terms with them\" has also been considered.[25] Rowling has stated that the books comprise \"a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry\" and that also pass on a message to \"question authority and ... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth\".[26]\n\n\nSome political commentators have seen J. K. Rowling's portrayal of the bureaucratised Ministry of Magic and the oppressive measures taken by the Ministry in the later books (like making attendance at Hogwarts School compulsory and the \"registration of Mudbloods\" with the Ministry) as an allegory criticising the state.[27]\n\n\n\n### Christian allegories[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Religious debates over the Harry Potter series § Christian allegories in Deathly Hallows\n\nThe *Harry Potter* series has been criticised for supposedly supporting witchcraft and the occult. Before publication of *Deathly Hallows*, Rowling refused to speak out about her religion, stating, \"If I talk too freely, every reader, whether 10 or 60, will be able to guess what's coming in the books\".[28] However, many have commented on Christian allegories that appear in *Deathly Hallows*.[28] For example, Harry dies and then comes back to life to save mankind, like Christ. The location where this occurs is King's Cross.[29] Rowling also stated that \"my belief and my struggling with religious belief ... I think is quite apparent in this book\", which is shown as Harry struggles with his faith in Dumbledore.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Philosopher's Stone as pictured in Michael Maier's 1617 alchemical work *Atalanta Fugiens*, similar to the presentation of the *Deathly Hallows* and *Resurrection Stone*.\n*Deathly Hallows* begins with a pair of epigraphs, one by Quaker leader William Penn and one from Aeschylus' *The Libation Bearers*. Of this, Rowling said \"I really enjoyed choosing those two quotations because one is pagan, of course, and one is from a Christian tradition. I'd known it was going to be those two passages since *Chamber* was published. I always knew [that] if I could use them at the beginning of book seven then I'd cued up the ending perfectly. If they were relevant, then I went where I needed to go. They just say it all to me, they really do\".[31]\n\n\nWhen Harry visits his parents' grave, the biblical reference \"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death\" (1 Corinthians 15:26) is inscribed on the grave.[32] The Dumbledores' family tomb also holds a biblical quote: \"Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also\", which is from Matthew 6:21.[32] Rowling states, \"They're very British books, so on a very practical note Harry was going to find biblical quotations on tombstones ... [but] I think those two particular quotations he finds on the tombstones at Godric's Hollow, they sum up – they almost epitomise the whole series\".[32]\n\n\n*Harry Potter* pundit John Granger additionally noted that one of the reasons the *Harry Potter* books were so popular is their use of literary alchemy (similar to *Romeo and Juliet*, C. S. Lewis's *Perelandra* and Charles Dickens's *A Tale of Two Cities*) and vision symbolism.[33] In this model, authors weave allegorical tales along the alchemical magnum opus. Since the medieval period, alchemical allegory has mirrored the passion, death and resurrection of Christ.[34] While the entire series utilises symbols common in alchemy, the *Deathly Hallows* completes this cycle, tying themes of death, rebirth, and the Resurrection Stone to the principal motif of alchemical allegory, and topics presented in the first book of the series.\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Harry Potter fandom\n\n### Marketing and promotion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Russian translation of the seventh book—\"Harry Potter and the Gift of Death\"—went on sale at the bookstore Moskva in Moscow on 13 October 2007\nThe launch was celebrated by an all-night book signing and reading at the Natural History Museum in London, which Rowling attended along with 1,700 guests chosen by ballot.[35] Rowling toured the US in October 2007, where another event was held at Carnegie Hall in New York City with tickets allocated by sweepstake.[36]\n\n\nScholastic, the American publisher of the Harry Potter series, launched a multimillion-dollar \"There will soon be 7\" marketing campaign with a \"Knight Bus\" travelling to 40 libraries across the United States, online fan discussions and competitions, collectible bookmarks, tattoos, and the staged release of seven *Deathly Hallows* questions most debated by fans.[37] In the build-up to the book's release, Scholastic released seven questions that fans would find answered in the final book:[38]\n\n\n\n1. Who will live? Who will die?\n2. Is Snape good or evil?\n3. Will Hogwarts reopen?\n4. Who ends up with whom?\n5. Where are the Horcruxes?\n6. Will Voldemort be defeated?\n7. What are the Deathly Hallows?\n\n\nJ. K. Rowling arranged with her publishers for a poster bearing the face of the missing British child Madeleine McCann to be made available to book sellers when *Deathly Hallows* was launched on 21 July 2007, and said that she hoped that the posters would be displayed prominently in shops all over the world.[39]\n\n\nAfter it was announced that the novel would be released on 21 July 2007, Warner Bros. soon said that the film adaptation of *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* would come out shortly before the novel's release, on 13 July 2007,[40] making many people proclaim July 2007 as the month of *Harry Potter*.[41]\n\n\n\n### Spoiler embargo[edit]\n\n\nBloomsbury invested £10 million in an attempt to keep the book's contents secure until 21 July, the release date.[42] Arthur Levine, US editor of the *Harry Potter* series, denied distributing any copies of *Deathly Hallows* in advance for press review, but two US papers published early reviews anyway.[43] There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalments—that the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the series—would no longer be a deterrent.[44]\n\n\n\n### Online leaks and early delivery[edit]\n\n\nIn the week before its release, a number of texts purporting to be genuine leaks appeared in various forms. On 16 July, a set of photographs representing all 759 pages of the US edition was leaked and was fully transcribed prior to the official release date.[45][46][47][48] The photographs later appeared on websites and peer-to-peer networks, leading Scholastic to seek a subpoena in order to identify one source.[49] This represented the most serious security breach in the Harry Potter series' history.[50] Rowling and her lawyer confirmed that there were genuine online leaks.[19][51] Reviews published in both *The Baltimore Sun* and *The New York Times* on 18 July 2007, corroborated many of the plot elements from this leak, and about one day prior to release, *The New York Times* confirmed that the main circulating leak was real.[50]\n\n\nScholastic announced that approximately one-ten-thousandth (0.0001) of the US supply had been shipped early — interpreted to mean about 1,200 copies. One reader in Maryland received a copy of the book in the mail from DeepDiscount.com four days before it was launched, which evoked incredulous responses from both Scholastic and DeepDiscount. Scholastic initially reported that they were satisfied it had been a \"human error\" and would not discuss possible penalties;[52] however, the following day Scholastic announced that it would be launching legal action against DeepDiscount.com and its distributor, Levy Home Entertainment.[53] Scholastic filed for damages in Chicago's Circuit Court of Cook County, claiming that DeepDiscount engaged in a \"complete and flagrant violation of the agreements that they knew were part of the carefully constructed release of this eagerly awaited book.\"[54] Some of the early-release books soon appeared on eBay, in one case being sold to *Publishers Weekly* for US$250 from an initial price of US$18.[55]\n\n\n\n### Price wars and other controversies[edit]\n\n\nAsda,[56][57] along with several other UK supermarkets, having already taken pre-orders for the book at a heavily discounted price, sparked a price war two days before the book's launch by announcing they would sell it for just £5 a copy. Other retail chains then also offered the book at discounted prices. At these prices the book became a loss leader. This caused uproar from traditional UK booksellers who argued they had no hope of competing in those conditions. Independent shops protested loudest, but even Waterstone's, the UK's largest dedicated chain bookstore, could not compete with the supermarket price. Some small bookstores hit back by buying their stock from the supermarkets rather than their wholesalers. Asda attempted to counter this by imposing a limit of two copies per customer to prevent bulk purchases. Philip Wicks, a spokesman for the UK Booksellers Association, said, \"It is a war we can't even participate in. We think it's a crying shame that the supermarkets have decided to treat it as a loss-leader, like a can of baked beans.\" Michael Norris, an analyst at Simba Information, said: \"You are not only lowering the price of the book. At this point, you are lowering the value of reading.\"[58]\n\n\nIn Malaysia, a similar price war caused controversy regarding sales of the book.[59] Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia was MYR 109.90, while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the book at MYR 69.90. The move by the bookstores was seen as an attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hypermarkets. However, as of 24 July 2007, the price war had ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books has also confirmed that Tesco and Carrefour were selling the book at a loss, urging them to practice good business sense and fair trade.[60]\n\n\nThe book's early Saturday morning release in Israel was criticised for violating Shabbat. Trade and Industry Minister Eli Yishai commented \"It is forbidden, according to Jewish values and Jewish culture, that a thing like this should take place at 2 am on Saturday. Let them do it on another day.\"[61] Yishai indicated that he would issue indictments and fines based on the Hours of Work and Rest Law.[62]\n\n\n\n### Editions[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* was released in hardcover on 21 July 2007[63] and in paperback in the United Kingdom on 10 July 2008[64] and the United States on 7 July 2009.[65] In SoHo, New York, there was a release party for the American paperback edition, with many games and activities.[66] An \"Adult Edition\" with a different cover illustration was released by Bloomsbury on 21 July 2007.[67] To be released simultaneously with the original US hardcover on 21 July with only 100,000 copies was a Scholastic deluxe edition, highlighting a new cover illustration by Mary GrandPré.[68] In October 2010, Bloomsbury released a \"Celebratory\" paperback edition, which featured a foiled and starred cover.[69] Lastly, on 1 November 2010, a \"Signature\" edition of the novel was released in paperback by Bloomsbury.[70]\n\n\n\n### Translations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter in translation\n\nAs with previous books in the series, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* has been translated into many languages. The first translation to be released was the Ukrainian translation, on 25 September 2007 (as *Гаррі Поттер і смертельні реліквії* – *Harry Potter i smertel'ni relikviji*).[71] The Swedish title of the book was revealed by Rowling as *Harry Potter and the Relics of Death* (*Harry Potter och Dödsrelikerna*), following a pre-release question from the Swedish publisher about the difficulty of translating the two words \"*Deathly Hallows*\" without having read the book.[72] This is also the title used for the French translation (*Harry Potter et les reliques de la mort*), the Spanish translation (*Harry Potter y las Reliquias de la Muerte*), the Dutch translation (*Harry Potter en de Relieken van de Dood*), the Serbian translation (*Хари Потер и реликвије смрти* –  *Hari Poter i relikvije smrti*) and the Brazilian Portuguese translation (*Harry Potter e as Relíquias da Morte*).[73] The first Polish translation was released with a new title: *Harry Potter i Insygnia Śmierci* – *Harry Potter and the Insignia of Death*.[74] The Hindi translation *Harry Potter aur Maut ke Tohfe* (हैरी पॉटर और मौत के तोहफे), which means \"Harry Potter and the Gifts of Death\", was released by Manjul Publication in India on 27 June 2008.[75] The Romanian version was released on 1 December 2007 using the title (*Harry Potter și Talismanele Morții*).\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*The Baltimore Sun*'s critic, Mary Carole McCauley, noted that the book was more serious than the previous novels in the series and had more straightforward prose.[76] Furthermore, reviewer Alice Fordham from *The Times* wrote that \"Rowling's genius is not just her total realisation of a fantasy world, but the quieter skill of creating characters that bounce off the page, real and flawed and brave and lovable\". Fordham concluded, \"We have been a long way together, and neither Rowling nor Harry let us down in the end\".[77] *The New York Times* writer Michiko Kakutani agreed, praising Rowling's ability to make Harry both a hero and a character that can be related to.[78]\n\n\n*Time* magazine's Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Fiction Books of 2007, ranking it at No. 8, and praised Rowling for proving that books can still be a global mass medium.[23] Novelist Elizabeth Hand criticised that \"... the spectacularly complex interplay of narrative and character often reads as though an entire trilogy's worth of summing-up has been crammed into one volume.\"[79] In a starred review from *Kirkus Reviews*, the reviewer said, \"Rowling has shown uncommon skill in playing them with and against each other, and also woven them into a darn good bildungsroman, populated by memorable characters and infused with a saving, irrepressible sense of fun\". They also praised the second half of the novel, but criticised the epilogue, calling it \"provocatively sketchy\".[80] In another review from *The Times*, reviewer Amanda Craig said that while Rowling was \"not an original, high-concept author\", she was \"right up there with other greats of children's fiction\". Craig went on to say that the novel was \"beautifully judged, and a triumphant return to form\", and that Rowling's imagination changed the perception of an entire generation, which \"is more than all but a handful of living authors, in any genre, have achieved in the past half-century\".[81]\n\n\nIn contrast, Jenny Sawyer of *The Christian Science Monitor* said that, \"There is much to love about the Harry Potter series, from its brilliantly realised magical world to its multilayered narrative\", however, \"A story is about someone who changes. And, puberty aside, Harry doesn't change much. As envisioned by Rowling, he walks the path of good so unwaveringly that his final victory over Voldemort feels, not just inevitable, but hollow\".[82] In *The New York Times*, Christopher Hitchens compared the series to World War Two-era English boarding school stories, and while he wrote that \"Rowling has won imperishable renown\" for the series as a whole, he also stated that he disliked Rowling's use of deus ex machina, that the mid-book camping chapters are \"abysmally long\", and Voldemort \"becomes more tiresome than an Ian Fleming villain\".[83] Catherine Bennett of *The Guardian* praised Rowling for putting small details from the previous books and making them large in *Deathly Hallows*, such as Grindelwald being mentioned on a Chocolate Frog Card in the first book. While she points out \"as her critics say, Rowling is no Dickens\", she says that Rowling \"has willed into a fictional being, in every book, legions of new characters, places, spells, rules and scores of unimagined twists and subplots\".[84]\n\n\nStephen King criticised the reactions of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work.[85] He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that the subject matter of the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He compared the works in this respect to *Huckleberry Finn* and *Alice in Wonderland* which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.[85]\n\n\n\n### Sales[edit]\n\n\n![There are many people in close proximity in a bookstore buying \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\".](image)Lines at a Californian Borders, five minutes until midnight to buy the book\nSales for *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* were record-setting. The initial US print run for *Deathly Hallows* was 12 million copies, and more than a million were pre-ordered through Amazon and Barnes & Noble,[86] 500 per cent higher than pre-sales had been for *Half-Blood Prince*.[87] On 12 April 2007, Barnes & Noble declared that *Deathly Hallows* had broken its pre-order record, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site.[88] On opening day, a record 8.3 million copies were sold in the United States (over 96 per second),[89][90] and 2.65 million copies in the United Kingdom.[91] It holds the Guinness World record for fastest selling book of fiction in 24 hours for US sales.[2] At WH Smith, sales reportedly reached a rate of 15 books sold per second.[92] By June 2008, nearly a year after it was published, worldwide sales were reportedly around 44 million.[93]\n\n\n\n### Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* has won several awards.[94] In 2007, the book was named one of *The New York Times* 100 Notable Books,[95] and one of its Notable Children's Books.[96] The novel was named the best book of 2007, by *Newsweek*'s critic Malcolm Jones.[97] *Publishers Weekly* also listed *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* among their Best Books of 2007.[98] Also in 2007 the book received the Andre Norton Award for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy at the Nebula Awards. In 2008, the American Library Association named the novel one of its Best Books for Young Adults,[99] and also listed it as a Notable Children's Book.[100] Furthermore, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* received the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award.[94]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n### Films[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\n\nThe two-part film adaptation of *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* was directed by David Yates, written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman, David Barron and J. K. Rowling. Part 1 was released on 19 November 2010, and Part 2 on 15 July 2011.[101][102] Filming began in February 2009, and ended on 12 June 2010.[103] However, the cast confirmed they would reshoot the epilogue scene as they only had two days to shoot the original.[*citation needed*] Reshoots ended around December 2010.[note 1][104] *Part 1* ended at Chapter 24 of the book, when Voldemort regained the Elder Wand.[105] However, there were a few omissions, such as the appearances of Dean Thomas and Viktor Krum, and Peter Pettigrew's death.[106] James Bernadelli of *Reelviews* said that the script stuck closest to the text since *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*,[107] yet this was met with negativity from some audiences as the film inherited \"the book's own problems\".[108]\n\n\n\n### Audiobooks[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* was released simultaneously on 21 July 2007, in both the UK and the United States.[109][110] The UK edition features the voice of Stephen Fry and runs about 24 hours[111] while the US edition features the voice of Jim Dale and runs about 21 hours.[112] Both Fry and Dale recorded 146 different and distinguishable character voices, and was the most recorded by an individual on an audiobook at the time.[113]\n\n\nFor his work on *Deathly Hallows*, Dale won the 2008 Grammy Award for the Best Spoken Word Album for Children.[114] He also was awarded an Earphone Award by *AudioFile*, who claimed, \"Dale has raised the bar on audiobook interpretation so high it's hard to imagine any narrator vaulting over it.\"[115]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nTwo action-adventure video games were produced by Electronic Arts (EA) to coincide with the release of the film adaptations, as with each of the previous *Harry Potter* films. Part 1 was released on 16 November 2010, and Part 2 on 12 July 2011. Both games received a mixed to negative reaction from critics.[116][117]\n\n\n\n## Subsequent works[edit]\n\n\n### *The Tales of Beedle the Bard*[edit]\n\n\nOn 4 December 2008, Rowling released *The Tales of Beedle the Bard* both in the UK and US.[118] *The Tales of Beedle the Bard* is a spin-off of *Deathly Hallows* and contains fairy tales that are told to children in the \"Wizarding World\". The book includes five short stories, including \"The Tale of the Three Brothers\" which is the story of the Deathly Hallows.\n\n\nAmazon released an exclusive collector's edition of the book which is a replica of the book that Amazon purchased at auction in December 2007.[119]\nSeven copies were auctioned off in London by Sotheby's. Each was illustrated and handwritten by Rowling and is 157 pages. It was bound in brown Moroccan leather and embellished with five hand-chased hallmarked sterling silver ornaments and mounted moonstones.[120]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* was released, a two-part play written by Jack Thorne based on an original story by Rowling, Thorne, and John Tiffany.[121] Billed as the eighth story in the *Harry Potter* series, it picks up where the epilogue of *Deathly Hallows* left off, following an adult Harry Potter and his son, Albus Severus Potter.[122] Previews of the play began at the Palace Theatre, London, on 7 June 2016,[123] and it premiered on 30 July 2016. The play opened on Broadway on 21 April 2018 at the Lyric Theatre, with previews starting on 16 March 2018.\n\n\nBoth parts of the stage play's script have been released in print and digital formats as *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Parts I & II*. The first edition, the Special Rehearsal Edition, corresponded to the script used in the preview shows and was published on 31 July 2016, the date of Harry's birthday in the series and Rowling's birthday, as well. Since revisions to the script continued after the book was printed, an edited version was released on 25 July 2017, as the \"Definitive Collector's Edition\".[*citation needed*] According to CNN, this was the most preordered book of 2016.[124]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** While this is not officially confirmed, Emma Watson is quoted as saying \"We have reshoots at Christmas\", so filming presumably ended around this time.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Record First-Day Sales for Last 'Harry Potter' Book\". *The New York Times*. 22 July 2007.

K. Rowling and the seventh and final novel in the *Harry Potter* series. It was released on 21 July 2007 in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury Publishing, in the United States by Scholastic, and in Canada by Raincoast Books. The novel chronicles the events directly following *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* (2005) and the final confrontation between the wizards Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.\n\n\n*Deathly Hallows* shattered sales records upon release, surpassing marks set by previous titles of the *Harry Potter* series. It holds the Guinness World Record for most novels sold within 24 hours of release, with 8.3 million sold in the US and 2.65 million in the UK.[1][2] Reception to the book was generally positive, and the book won the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award, and the American Library Association named it the \"Best Book for Young Adults\". A play, *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, was written by Jack Thorne, and based on an original story written by J. K. Rowling, John Tiffany, and Thorne, premiering at the Palace Theatre in London on 30 July 2016. Rowling has referred to the play as \"the eighth Harry Potter story\", and is set nineteen years after the events of the Deathly Hallows, effectively picking up where the epilogue of the seventh book ended.\n\n\nA film adaptation of the novel was released in two parts: *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1* in November 2010 and *Part 2* in July 2011.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\nThroughout the six previous novels, Harry Potter has struggled with the difficulties of adolescence along with being famous as the only person ever to survive the Killing Curse. The curse was cast by Tom Riddle, better known as Lord Voldemort, an evil wizard who murdered Harry's parents and attempted to kill Harry as a baby, due to a prophecy which claimed Harry would be able to stop him. As an orphan, Harry was placed in the care of his Muggle (non-magical) relatives Petunia Dursley and Vernon Dursley, with their son Dudley Dursley.\n\n\nIn *The Philosopher's Stone*, Harry re-enters the wizarding world at age 11 and enrols in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He befriends fellow students Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and is mentored by the school's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. He also meets Professor Severus Snape, who dislikes and bullies him. Harry fights Voldemort several times while at school as the wizard tries to regain a physical form. In *Goblet of Fire*, Harry is mysteriously entered in the Triwizard Tournament and discovers it is a trap designed to allow the return of Voldemort to full strength. In *Order of the Phoenix*, Harry and several of his friends face off against Voldemort's followers, the Death Eaters. In *Half-Blood Prince*, Harry learns that Voldemort has divided his soul into parts, creating \"Horcruxes\" from various unknown objects to contain them. In this way, he has ensured his immortality as long as at least one Horcrux still exists.[3] Two of these are destroyed: a diary destroyed by Harry in *Chamber of Secrets* and a ring destroyed by Dumbledore shortly before the events of *Half-Blood Prince*. Dumbledore takes Harry along in an attempt to destroy a third Horcrux, Slytherin's locket. However, the Horcrux was taken by an unknown wizard, and upon their return, Dumbledore is ambushed and disarmed by Draco Malfoy. Draco cannot bring himself to kill Dumbledore, so Snape does it instead.\n\n\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\nHarry is about to turn seventeen and will lose his deceased mother's magical protection. Order of the Phoenix members relocate the Dursleys for their protection. Harry is being flown to The Burrow, with friends and allies acting as identical decoys. Death Eaters immediately attack, and, in the ensuing battle, \"Mad-Eye\" Moody and Hedwig are killed while George Weasley is wounded. Voldemort arrives to kill Harry, whose wand fends off the attack.\n\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione prepare to hunt down Voldemort's four remaining Horcruxes. Each is bequeathed an object from Dumbledore: a Golden Snitch for Harry, a Deluminator for Ron, and *The Tales of Beedle the Bard*, for Hermione. Harry is also bequeathed the Sword of Godric Gryffindor, but the Ministry claims it never belonged to Dumbledore. Death Eaters attack during Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding reception while the Ministry of Magic falls to Voldemort. The trio flee to 12 Grimmauld Place, Sirius Black's family home that was left to Harry.\n\n\nThey discover that Sirius's late brother, Regulus, was the mysterious R.A.B. who stole the Horcrux locket but died in the process. His house-elf Kreacher was unable to destroy the locket, which was later stolen by Mundungus Fletcher. Kreacher locates Fletcher, who says the locket was taken by Ministry official Dolores Umbridge. Infiltrating the Ministry, the trio steal the locket from Umbridge, but Grimmauld Place is compromised in their escape. They flee to the forest and are unable to destroy the locket and have no further leads. The locket's dark nature affects Ron, who abandons the group. Harry and Hermione learn about Dumbledore's past with dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald. They travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace. There they are attacked by Voldemort's snake, Nagini, who inhabited Bathilda Bagshot's corpse. They escape, but Harry's wand is badly damaged. One night, a doe Patronus guides Harry to a pond containing the Sword of Godric Gryffindor. When Harry tries to recover it, the locket tightens around his neck, nearly killing him. Ron, guided back by the Deluminator, saves him and destroys the locket Horcrux with the sword.\n\n\nIn Dumbledore's book, Hermione identifies a symbol also worn by Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius Lovegood. He tells them of the mythical Deathly Hallows: the Elder Wand, an unbeatable wand; the Resurrection Stone, which can summon the dead; and an Invisibility Cloak. Xenophilius fails to say that Luna is being held captive. He summons Death Eaters to capture the trio in exchange for his daughter's freedom, but they escape. They speculate that Dumbledore won the Elder Wand by defeating Grindelwald. Harry's Invisibility Cloak is the third Hallow, and his Snitch contains the Resurrection Stone.\n\n\nThe trio are captured and taken to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix tortures Hermione, believing they stole Gryffindor's sword from her Gringotts vault. With help from Dobby the house-elf, they escape to Bill and Fleur's seaside cottage, along with fellow prisoners, including Luna, Mr Ollivander, and the goblin Griphook. During the escape, Bellatrix fatally wounds Dobby, and Harry hand-digs the house-elf’s grave. Harry has a vision of Voldemort stealing the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb. The trio break into Bellatrix's vault, believing another Horcrux is there. With Griphook's help, they break in, retrieve Hufflepuff's cup, and escape, though Griphook steals Gryffindor's sword in the process. Harry has another vision that Voldemort has been informed of the heist and decides to check his Horcruxes. Harry sees that Nagini is a Horcrux, and another is hidden at Hogwarts.\n\n\nDumbledore's brother, Aberforth, helps the trio enter Hogwarts. Voldemort, alerted to Harry's whereabouts, mounts an assault on Hogwarts. The teachers and students mobilize to defend the school. Ron and Hermione destroy Hufflepuff's cup with basilisk fangs from the Chamber of Secrets and share an impulsive kiss. Harry discovers Ravenclaw's diadem is the Horcrux hidden there. The trio find it in the Room of Requirement but Draco, Crabbe and Goyle ambush them. Crabbe attacks with fiendfyre, but is unable to control it; the cursed fire kills him and destroys the diadem. Meanwhile, many allies die during Voldemort's assault, including Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, and Fred Weasley.\n\n\nThe Elder Wand resists Voldemort's commands. Believing that Snape, having killed Dumbledore, is its true master, he has Nagini attack him just as Harry arrives. Mortally wounded, Snape passes his memories to Harry. Harry views them in the Pensieve. The memories reveal that Snape loved Harry's mother and acted as a double agent against Voldemort in an attempt to protect her. He watched over the trio, conjuring the doe Patronus, influenced by his love for Lily, who also had a doe Patronus. Dumbledore was dying after mishandling the ring Horcrux and planned his \"murder\" at Snape's hands. Harry also learns he is an unintentional Horcrux, unbeknownst to Voldemort, and must die to render Voldemort mortal. Before surrendering himself, Harry instructs Neville Longbottom to kill Nagini. On the way, he uses the Resurrection Stone to reunite with his parents and other deceased loved ones. He drops the stone as he meets Voldemort, who casts the Killing Curse on him.\n\n\nHarry awakens in a dreamlike location resembling King's Cross where he is greeted by Dumbledore. Dumbledore explains that Voldemort's original Killing Curse left a soul fragment in Harry, causing their connection. The latest Killing Curse destroyed that soul fragment, allowing Harry to return to life or to \"go on\". Harry returns to life and feigns death. Voldemort calls for a truce at Hogwarts and demands their surrender. Neville, however, pulls Gryffindor's sword from the Sorting Hat and kills Nagini.\n\n\nThe battle resumes, with Molly Weasley killing Bellatrix. Harry reveals himself to Voldemort and engages him in a final battle. He explains the Elder Wand's loyalty transfers upon the defeat, not the killing of its former master. Draco, not Snape, had been the Elder Wand's master, having disarmed Dumbledore before Snape killed him. Having disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor, Harry now commands the Elder Wand. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse at Harry, but the spell rebounds, killing Voldemort. Before returning the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's tomb, Harry uses it to repair his old wand. He keeps his Invisibility Cloak and leaves the Resurrection Stone lost in the forest.\n\n\n\nEpilogue\nNineteen years later, the trio see their children off to Hogwarts. Harry and Ginny have three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. Ron and Hermione have two children, Rose and Hugo. Harry's godson Teddy Lupin, son of Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks, is found kissing Bill and Fleur's daughter Victoire; Draco and his wife are seeing off their son Scorpius. Albus is departing for his first year and worries he will be sorted into Slytherin. Harry reassures him, recounting Snape's bravery, and revealing the Sorting Hat could account for his wishes. As his scar has not hurt in nineteen years, the narrator concludes that \"all was well\".\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Franchise[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, the first book in the series, was published by Bloomsbury on 30 June 1997.[4] The second book, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* was published on 2 July 1998.[5] *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was then published a year later on 8 July 1999.[5] *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* was published on 8 July 2000.[6] *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* was published on 21 June 2003.[7] *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* was published on 16 July 2005, and sold 9 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release.[8][9]\n\n\n\n### Choice of title[edit]\n\n\nThe title of the book refers to three mythical objects featured in the story, collectively known as the \"Deathly Hallows\"—an unbeatable wand (the Elder Wand), a stone to bring the dead to life (the Resurrection Stone), and a cloak of invisibility. Shortly before releasing the title, J. K. Rowling announced that she had considered three titles for the book.[10][11] The final title was released to the public on 21 December 2006, via a special Christmas-themed hangman puzzle on Rowling's website, confirmed shortly afterwards by the book's publishers.[12] When asked during a live chat about the other titles she had been considering, Rowling mentioned *Harry Potter and the Elder Wand* and *Harry Potter and the Peverell Quest*.[10]\n\n\n\n### Rowling on finishing the book[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rowling completed the final chapters of *Deathly Hallows* in Room 552 of the Balmoral Hotel.\nRowling completed the book while staying at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh in January 2007, leaving a signed statement on a marble bust of Hermes in her room that reads \"J. K. Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in this room (552) on 11 January 2007\".[13] In a statement on her website, she said, \"I've never felt such a mixture of extreme emotions in my life, never dreamed I could feel simultaneously heartbroken and euphoric.\" She compared her mixed feelings to those expressed by Charles Dickens in the preface of the 1850 edition of *David Copperfield*, \"a two-years' imaginative task\". \"To which,\" she added, \"I can only sigh, try seventeen years, Charles\". She ended her message by saying \"*Deathly Hallows* is my favourite, and that is the most wonderful way to finish the series\".[14]\n\n\nWhen asked before publication about the forthcoming book, Rowling stated that she could not change the ending even if she wanted. \"These books have been plotted for such a long time, and for six books now, that they're all leading a certain direction. So, I really can't\".[15] She also commented that the final volume related closely to the previous book in the series, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, \"almost as though they are two-halves of the same novel\".[16] She has said that the last chapter of the book was written \"in something like 1990\", as part of her earliest work on the series.[17] Rowling also revealed she originally wrote the last words to be something like: 'Only those who he loved could see his lightning scar'\". Rowling changed this because she did not want people to think Voldemort would rise again and to say that Harry's mission was over.[18][19]\n\n\n\n## Major themes[edit]\n\n\n![A blonde woman with blue eyes has a red and white robe on over her dress is holding an honorary degree with her left hand.](image)J. K. Rowling has said that the main theme of the series is Harry dealing with death.\n### Death[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2006 interview, J. K. Rowling said that the main theme of the series is Harry dealing with death,[20] which was influenced by her mother's death in 1990, from multiple sclerosis.[18][20][21][22] Lev Grossman of *Time* stated that the main theme of the series was the overwhelming importance of continuing to love in the face of death.[23]\n\n\n\n### Living in a corrupted society[edit]\n\n\nAcademics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books, some more complex than others, and some including political subtexts. Themes such as normality, oppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series.[24] Similarly, the theme of making one's way through adolescence and \"going over one's most harrowing ordeals—and thus coming to terms with them\" has also been considered.[25] Rowling has stated that the books comprise \"a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry\" and that also pass on a message to \"question authority and ... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth\".[26]\n\n\nSome political commentators have seen J. K. Rowling's portrayal of the bureaucratised Ministry of Magic and the oppressive measures taken by the Ministry in the later books (like making attendance at Hogwarts School compulsory and the \"registration of Mudbloods\" with the Ministry) as an allegory criticising the state.[27]\n\n\n\n### Christian allegories[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Religious debates over the Harry Potter series § Christian allegories in Deathly Hallows\n\nThe *Harry Potter* series has been criticised for supposedly supporting witchcraft and the occult. Before publication of *Deathly Hallows*, Rowling refused to speak out about her religion, stating, \"If I talk too freely, every reader, whether 10 or 60, will be able to guess what's coming in the books\".[28] However, many have commented on Christian allegories that appear in *Deathly Hallows*.[28] For example, Harry dies and then comes back to life to save mankind, like Christ. The location where this occurs is King's Cross.[29] Rowling also stated that \"my belief and my struggling with religious belief ... I think is quite apparent in this book\", which is shown as Harry struggles with his faith in Dumbledore.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Philosopher's Stone as pictured in Michael Maier's 1617 alchemical work *Atalanta Fugiens*, similar to the presentation of the *Deathly Hallows* and *Resurrection Stone*.\n*Deathly Hallows* begins with a pair of epigraphs, one by Quaker leader William Penn and one from Aeschylus' *The Libation Bearers*. Of this, Rowling said \"I really enjoyed choosing those two quotations because one is pagan, of course, and one is from a Christian tradition. I'd known it was going to be those two passages since *Chamber* was published. I always knew [that] if I could use them at the beginning of book seven then I'd cued up the ending perfectly. If they were relevant, then I went where I needed to go. They just say it all to me, they really do\".[31]\n\n\nWhen Harry visits his parents' grave, the biblical reference \"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death\" (1 Corinthians 15:26) is inscribed on the grave.[32] The Dumbledores' family tomb also holds a biblical quote: \"Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also\", which is from Matthew 6:21.[32] Rowling states, \"They're very British books, so on a very practical note Harry was going to find biblical quotations on tombstones ... [but] I think those two particular quotations he finds on the tombstones at Godric's Hollow, they sum up – they almost epitomise the whole series\".[32]\n\n\n*Harry Potter* pundit John Granger additionally noted that one of the reasons the *Harry Potter* books were so popular is their use of literary alchemy (similar to *Romeo and Juliet*, C. S. Lewis's *Perelandra* and Charles Dickens's *A Tale of Two Cities*) and vision symbolism.[33] In this model, authors weave allegorical tales along the alchemical magnum opus. Since the medieval period, alchemical allegory has mirrored the passion, death and resurrection of Christ.[34] While the entire series utilises symbols common in alchemy, the *Deathly Hallows* completes this cycle, tying themes of death, rebirth, and the Resurrection Stone to the principal motif of alchemical allegory, and topics presented in the first book of the series.\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Harry Potter fandom\n\n### Marketing and promotion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Russian translation of the seventh book—\"Harry Potter and the Gift of Death\"—went on sale at the bookstore Moskva in Moscow on 13 October 2007\nThe launch was celebrated by an all-night book signing and reading at the Natural History Museum in London, which Rowling attended along with 1,700 guests chosen by ballot.[35] Rowling toured the US in October 2007, where another event was held at Carnegie Hall in New York City with tickets allocated by sweepstake.[36]\n\n\nScholastic, the American publisher of the Harry Potter series, launched a multimillion-dollar \"There will soon be 7\" marketing campaign with a \"Knight Bus\" travelling to 40 libraries across the United States, online fan discussions and competitions, collectible bookmarks, tattoos, and the staged release of seven *Deathly Hallows* questions most debated by fans.[37] In the build-up to the book's release, Scholastic released seven questions that fans would find answered in the final book:[38]\n\n\n\n1. Who will live? Who will die?\n2. Is Snape good or evil?\n3. Will Hogwarts reopen?\n4. Who ends up with whom?\n5. Where are the Horcruxes?\n6. Will Voldemort be defeated?\n7. What are the Deathly Hallows?\n\n\nJ. K. Rowling arranged with her publishers for a poster bearing the face of the missing British child Madeleine McCann to be made available to book sellers when *Deathly Hallows* was launched on 21 July 2007, and said that she hoped that the posters would be displayed prominently in shops all over the world.[39]\n\n\nAfter it was announced that the novel would be released on 21 July 2007, Warner Bros. soon said that the film adaptation of *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* would come out shortly before the novel's release, on 13 July 2007,[40] making many people proclaim July 2007 as the month of *Harry Potter*.[41]\n\n\n\n### Spoiler embargo[edit]\n\n\nBloomsbury invested £10 million in an attempt to keep the book's contents secure until 21 July, the release date.[42] Arthur Levine, US editor of the *Harry Potter* series, denied distributing any copies of *Deathly Hallows* in advance for press review, but two US papers published early reviews anyway.[43] There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalments—that the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the series—would no longer be a deterrent.[44]\n\n\n\n### Online leaks and early delivery[edit]\n\n\nIn the week before its release, a number of texts purporting to be genuine leaks appeared in various forms. On 16 July, a set of photographs representing all 759 pages of the US edition was leaked and was fully transcribed prior to the official release date.[45][46][47][48] The photographs later appeared on websites and peer-to-peer networks, leading Scholastic to seek a subpoena in order to identify one source.[49] This represented the most serious security breach in the Harry Potter series' history.[50] Rowling and her lawyer confirmed that there were genuine online leaks.[19][51] Reviews published in both *The Baltimore Sun* and *The New York Times* on 18 July 2007, corroborated many of the plot elements from this leak, and about one day prior to release, *The New York Times* confirmed that the main circulating leak was real.[50]\n\n\nScholastic announced that approximately one-ten-thousandth (0.0001) of the US supply had been shipped early — interpreted to mean about 1,200 copies. One reader in Maryland received a copy of the book in the mail from DeepDiscount.com four days before it was launched, which evoked incredulous responses from both Scholastic and DeepDiscount. Scholastic initially reported that they were satisfied it had been a \"human error\" and would not discuss possible penalties;[52] however, the following day Scholastic announced that it would be launching legal action against DeepDiscount.com and its distributor, Levy Home Entertainment.[53] Scholastic filed for damages in Chicago's Circuit Court of Cook County, claiming that DeepDiscount engaged in a \"complete and flagrant violation of the agreements that they knew were part of the carefully constructed release of this eagerly awaited book.\"[54] Some of the early-release books soon appeared on eBay, in one case being sold to *Publishers Weekly* for US$250 from an initial price of US$18.[55]\n\n\n\n### Price wars and other controversies[edit]\n\n\nAsda,[56][57] along with several other UK supermarkets, having already taken pre-orders for the book at a heavily discounted price, sparked a price war two days before the book's launch by announcing they would sell it for just £5 a copy. Other retail chains then also offered the book at discounted prices. At these prices the book became a loss leader. This caused uproar from traditional UK booksellers who argued they had no hope of competing in those conditions. Independent shops protested loudest, but even Waterstone's, the UK's largest dedicated chain bookstore, could not compete with the supermarket price. Some small bookstores hit back by buying their stock from the supermarkets rather than their wholesalers. Asda attempted to counter this by imposing a limit of two copies per customer to prevent bulk purchases. Philip Wicks, a spokesman for the UK Booksellers Association, said, \"It is a war we can't even participate in. We think it's a crying shame that the supermarkets have decided to treat it as a loss-leader, like a can of baked beans.\" Michael Norris, an analyst at Simba Information, said: \"You are not only lowering the price of the book. At this point, you are lowering the value of reading.\"[58]\n\n\nIn Malaysia, a similar price war caused controversy regarding sales of the book.[59] Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia was MYR 109.90, while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the book at MYR 69.90. The move by the bookstores was seen as an attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hypermarkets. However, as of 24 July 2007, the price war had ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books has also confirmed that Tesco and Carrefour were selling the book at a loss, urging them to practice good business sense and fair trade.[60]\n\n\nThe book's early Saturday morning release in Israel was criticised for violating Shabbat. Trade and Industry Minister Eli Yishai commented \"It is forbidden, according to Jewish values and Jewish culture, that a thing like this should take place at 2 am on Saturday. Let them do it on another day.\"[61] Yishai indicated that he would issue indictments and fines based on the Hours of Work and Rest Law.[62]\n\n\n\n### Editions[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* was released in hardcover on 21 July 2007[63] and in paperback in the United Kingdom on 10 July 2008[64] and the United States on 7 July 2009.[65] In SoHo, New York, there was a release party for the American paperback edition, with many games and activities.[66] An \"Adult Edition\" with a different cover illustration was released by Bloomsbury on 21 July 2007.[67] To be released simultaneously with the original US hardcover on 21 July with only 100,000 copies was a Scholastic deluxe edition, highlighting a new cover illustration by Mary GrandPré.[68] In October 2010, Bloomsbury released a \"Celebratory\" paperback edition, which featured a foiled and starred cover.[69] Lastly, on 1 November 2010, a \"Signature\" edition of the novel was released in paperback by Bloomsbury.[70]\n\n\n\n### Translations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter in translation\n\nAs with previous books in the series, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* has been translated into many languages. The first translation to be released was the Ukrainian translation, on 25 September 2007 (as *Гаррі Поттер і смертельні реліквії* – *Harry Potter i smertel'ni relikviji*).[71] The Swedish title of the book was revealed by Rowling as *Harry Potter and the Relics of Death* (*Harry Potter och Dödsrelikerna*), following a pre-release question from the Swedish publisher about the difficulty of translating the two words \"*Deathly Hallows*\" without having read the book.[72] This is also the title used for the French translation (*Harry Potter et les reliques de la mort*), the Spanish translation (*Harry Potter y las Reliquias de la Muerte*), the Dutch translation (*Harry Potter en de Relieken van de Dood*), the Serbian translation (*Хари Потер и реликвије смрти* –  *Hari Poter i relikvije smrti*) and the Brazilian Portuguese translation (*Harry Potter e as Relíquias da Morte*).[73] The first Polish translation was released with a new title: *Harry Potter i Insygnia Śmierci* – *Harry Potter and the Insignia of Death*.[74] The Hindi translation *Harry Potter aur Maut ke Tohfe* (हैरी पॉटर और मौत के तोहफे), which means \"Harry Potter and the Gifts of Death\", was released by Manjul Publication in India on 27 June 2008.[75] The Romanian version was released on 1 December 2007 using the title (*Harry Potter și Talismanele Morții*).\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*The Baltimore Sun*'s critic, Mary Carole McCauley, noted that the book was more serious than the previous novels in the series and had more straightforward prose.[76] Furthermore, reviewer Alice Fordham from *The Times* wrote that \"Rowling's genius is not just her total realisation of a fantasy world, but the quieter skill of creating characters that bounce off the page, real and flawed and brave and lovable\". Fordham concluded, \"We have been a long way together, and neither Rowling nor Harry let us down in the end\".[77] *The New York Times* writer Michiko Kakutani agreed, praising Rowling's ability to make Harry both a hero and a character that can be related to.[78]\n\n\n*Time* magazine's Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Fiction Books of 2007, ranking it at No. 8, and praised Rowling for proving that books can still be a global mass medium.[23] Novelist Elizabeth Hand criticised that \"... the spectacularly complex interplay of narrative and character often reads as though an entire trilogy's worth of summing-up has been crammed into one volume.\"[79] In a starred review from *Kirkus Reviews*, the reviewer said, \"Rowling has shown uncommon skill in playing them with and against each other, and also woven them into a darn good bildungsroman, populated by memorable characters and infused with a saving, irrepressible sense of fun\". They also praised the second half of the novel, but criticised the epilogue, calling it \"provocatively sketchy\".[80] In another review from *The Times*, reviewer Amanda Craig said that while Rowling was \"not an original, high-concept author\", she was \"right up there with other greats of children's fiction\". Craig went on to say that the novel was \"beautifully judged, and a triumphant return to form\", and that Rowling's imagination changed the perception of an entire generation, which \"is more than all but a handful of living authors, in any genre, have achieved in the past half-century\".[81]\n\n\nIn contrast, Jenny Sawyer of *The Christian Science Monitor* said that, \"There is much to love about the Harry Potter series, from its brilliantly realised magical world to its multilayered narrative\", however, \"A story is about someone who changes. And, puberty aside, Harry doesn't change much. As envisioned by Rowling, he walks the path of good so unwaveringly that his final victory over Voldemort feels, not just inevitable, but hollow\".[82] In *The New York Times*, Christopher Hitchens compared the series to World War Two-era English boarding school stories, and while he wrote that \"Rowling has won imperishable renown\" for the series as a whole, he also stated that he disliked Rowling's use of deus ex machina, that the mid-book camping chapters are \"abysmally long\", and Voldemort \"becomes more tiresome than an Ian Fleming villain\".[83] Catherine Bennett of *The Guardian* praised Rowling for putting small details from the previous books and making them large in *Deathly Hallows*, such as Grindelwald being mentioned on a Chocolate Frog Card in the first book. While she points out \"as her critics say, Rowling is no Dickens\", she says that Rowling \"has willed into a fictional being, in every book, legions of new characters, places, spells, rules and scores of unimagined twists and subplots\".[84]\n\n\nStephen King criticised the reactions of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work.[85] He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that the subject matter of the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He compared the works in this respect to *Huckleberry Finn* and *Alice in Wonderland* which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.[85]\n\n\n\n### Sales[edit]\n\n\n![There are many people in close proximity in a bookstore buying \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\".](image)Lines at a Californian Borders, five minutes until midnight to buy the book\nSales for *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* were record-setting. The initial US print run for *Deathly Hallows* was 12 million copies, and more than a million were pre-ordered through Amazon and Barnes & Noble,[86] 500 per cent higher than pre-sales had been for *Half-Blood Prince*.[87] On 12 April 2007, Barnes & Noble declared that *Deathly Hallows* had broken its pre-order record, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site.[88] On opening day, a record 8.3 million copies were sold in the United States (over 96 per second),[89][90] and 2.65 million copies in the United Kingdom.[91] It holds the Guinness World record for fastest selling book of fiction in 24 hours for US sales.[2] At WH Smith, sales reportedly reached a rate of 15 books sold per second.[92] By June 2008, nearly a year after it was published, worldwide sales were reportedly around 44 million.[93]\n\n\n\n### Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* has won several awards.[94] In 2007, the book was named one of *The New York Times* 100 Notable Books,[95] and one of its Notable Children's Books.[96] The novel was named the best book of 2007, by *Newsweek*'s critic Malcolm Jones.[97] *Publishers Weekly* also listed *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* among their Best Books of 2007.[98] Also in 2007 the book received the Andre Norton Award for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy at the Nebula Awards. In 2008, the American Library Association named the novel one of its Best Books for Young Adults,[99] and also listed it as a Notable Children's Book.[100] Furthermore, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* received the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award.[94]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n### Films[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\n\nThe two-part film adaptation of *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* was directed by David Yates, written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman, David Barron and J. K. Rowling. Part 1 was released on 19 November 2010, and Part 2 on 15 July 2011.[101][102] Filming began in February 2009, and ended on 12 June 2010.[103] However, the cast confirmed they would reshoot the epilogue scene as they only had two days to shoot the original.[*citation needed*] Reshoots ended around December 2010.[note 1][104] *Part 1* ended at Chapter 24 of the book, when Voldemort regained the Elder Wand.[105] However, there were a few omissions, such as the appearances of Dean Thomas and Viktor Krum, and Peter Pettigrew's death.[106] James Bernadelli of *Reelviews* said that the script stuck closest to the text since *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*,[107] yet this was met with negativity from some audiences as the film inherited \"the book's own problems\".[108]\n\n\n\n### Audiobooks[edit]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* was released simultaneously on 21 July 2007, in both the UK and the United States.[109][110] The UK edition features the voice of Stephen Fry and runs about 24 hours[111] while the US edition features the voice of Jim Dale and runs about 21 hours.[112] Both Fry and Dale recorded 146 different and distinguishable character voices, and was the most recorded by an individual on an audiobook at the time.[113]\n\n\nFor his work on *Deathly Hallows*, Dale won the 2008 Grammy Award for the Best Spoken Word Album for Children.[114] He also was awarded an Earphone Award by *AudioFile*, who claimed, \"Dale has raised the bar on audiobook interpretation so high it's hard to imagine any narrator vaulting over it.\"[115]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nTwo action-adventure video games were produced by Electronic Arts (EA) to coincide with the release of the film adaptations, as with each of the previous *Harry Potter* films. Part 1 was released on 16 November 2010, and Part 2 on 12 July 2011. Both games received a mixed to negative reaction from critics.[116][117]\n\n\n\n## Subsequent works[edit]\n\n\n### *The Tales of Beedle the Bard*[edit]\n\n\nOn 4 December 2008, Rowling released *The Tales of Beedle the Bard* both in the UK and US.[118] *The Tales of Beedle the Bard* is a spin-off of *Deathly Hallows* and contains fairy tales that are told to children in the \"Wizarding World\". The book includes five short stories, including \"The Tale of the Three Brothers\" which is the story of the Deathly Hallows.\n\n\nAmazon released an exclusive collector's edition of the book which is a replica of the book that Amazon purchased at auction in December 2007.[119]\nSeven copies were auctioned off in London by Sotheby's. Each was illustrated and handwritten by Rowling and is 157 pages. It was bound in brown Moroccan leather and embellished with five hand-chased hallmarked sterling silver ornaments and mounted moonstones.[120]\n\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* was released, a two-part play written by Jack Thorne based on an original story by Rowling, Thorne, and John Tiffany.[121] Billed as the eighth story in the *Harry Potter* series, it picks up where the epilogue of *Deathly Hallows* left off, following an adult Harry Potter and his son, Albus Severus Potter.[122] Previews of the play began at the Palace Theatre, London, on 7 June 2016,[123] and it premiered on 30 July 2016. The play opened on Broadway on 21 April 2018 at the Lyric Theatre, with previews starting on 16 March 2018.\n\n\nBoth parts of the stage play's script have been released in print and digital formats as *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Parts I & II*. The first edition, the Special Rehearsal Edition, corresponded to the script used in the preview shows and was published on 31 July 2016, the date of Harry's birthday in the series and Rowling's birthday, as well. Since revisions to the script continued after the book was printed, an edited version was released on 25 July 2017, as the \"Definitive Collector's Edition\".[*citation needed*] According to CNN, this was the most preordered book of 2016.[124]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** While this is not officially confirmed, Emma Watson is quoted as saying \"We have reshoots at Christmas\", so filming presumably ended around this time.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Record First-Day Sales for Last 'Harry Potter' Book\". *The New York Times*. 22 July 2007.
