It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F) out of all Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 97.8° with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84 Earth years orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness. \n\n\nUranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System's planets. Based on current models, inside its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amounts of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide (thought to have been originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere, such as its peak wind speed of 900 km/h (560 mph),[22] variations in its polar cap and its erratic cloud formation. The planet also has very low internal heat compared to other giant planets, which is still unexplained. \n\n\nLike the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, orbiting natural satellites and a magnetosphere. Its ring system is extremely dark, with only about 2% of the incoming light reflected, and contains the known 13 inner moons. Further out are the larger five major moons of the planet: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon; and orbiting at much greater distance from Uranus are the known nine irregular moons. The planet's magnetosphere is highly asymmetric and has many charged particles, which may cause the darkening of its rings and moons.\n\n\nUranus is visible to the naked eye, but it is very dim and was not classified as a planet until 1781, when it was first observed by William Herschel. About seven decades after its discovery, consensus was reached that the planet be named from the Greek god Uranus (Ouranos), one of the Greek primordial deities. As of 2023, it was visited up close only once when in 1986 the *Voyager 2* probe flew by the planet.[23] Though nowadays it can be resolved and observed by telescopes, there is much desire to revisit the planet, as shown by Planetary Science Decadal Survey's decision to make the proposed Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission a top priority in the 2023–2032 survey.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Position of Uranus (marked with a cross) on the date of its discovery, March 13th, 1781\nLike the classical planets, Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.[24] Sir William Herschel first observed Uranus on 13 March 1781, leading to its discovery as a planet, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time in history and making Uranus the first planet classified as such with the aid of a telescope.\n\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nUranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet, but it was generally mistaken for a star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by Hipparchus, who in 128 BC might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into Ptolemy's *Almagest*.[25] The earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed observed it at least six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769,[26] including on four consecutive nights.\n\n\nSir William Herschel observed Uranus on 13 March 1781 from the garden of his house at 19 New King Street in Bath, Somerset, England (now the Herschel Museum of Astronomy),[27] and initially reported it (on 26 April 1781) as a comet.[28] With a homemade 6.2-inch reflecting telescope, Herschel \"engaged in a series of observations on the parallax of the fixed stars.\"[29][30]\n\n\nHerschel recorded in his journal: \"In the quartile near ζ Tauri ... either [a] Nebulous star or perhaps a comet.\"[31] On 17 March he noted: \"I looked for the Comet or Nebulous Star and found that it is a Comet, for it has changed its place.\"[32] When he presented his discovery to the Royal Society, he continued to assert that he had found a comet, but also implicitly compared it to a planet:[29]\n\n\n\n\n> The power I had on when I first saw the comet was 227. From experience I know that the diameters of the fixed stars are not proportionally magnified with higher powers, as planets are; therefore I now put the powers at 460 and 932, and found that the diameter of the comet increased in proportion to the power, as it ought to be, on the supposition of its not being a fixed star, while the diameters of the stars to which I compared it were not increased in the same ratio. Moreover, the comet being magnified much beyond what its light would admit of, appeared hazy and ill-defined with these great powers, while the stars preserved that lustre and distinctness which from many thousand observations I knew they would retain. The sequel has shown that my surmises were well-founded, this proving to be the Comet we have lately observed.[29]\n> \n> \n\n\nHerschel notified the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne of his discovery and received this flummoxed reply from him on 23 April 1781: \"I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it.\"[33]\n\n\nAlthough Herschel continued to describe his new object as a comet, other astronomers had already begun to suspect otherwise. Finnish-Swedish astronomer Anders Johan Lexell, working in Russia, was the first to compute the orbit of the new object.[34] Its nearly circular orbit led him to the conclusion that it was a planet rather than a comet. Berlin astronomer Johann Elert Bode described Herschel's discovery as \"a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of Saturn\".[35] Bode concluded that its near-circular orbit was more like a planet's than a comet's.[36]\n\n\nThe object was soon universally accepted as a new planet. By 1783, Herschel acknowledged this to Royal Society president Joseph Banks: \"By the observation of the most eminent Astronomers in Europe it appears that the new star, which I had the honour of pointing out to them in March 1781, is a Primary Planet of our Solar System.\"[37] In recognition of his achievement, King George III gave Herschel an annual stipend of £200 (equivalent to £30,000 in 2023)[38] on condition that he moved to Windsor so that the Royal Family could look through his telescopes.[39]\n\n\n\n### Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name Uranus references the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus (Ancient Greek: Οὐρανός), known as Caelus in Roman mythology, the father of Cronus (Saturn) and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter), which was rendered as *Uranus* in Latin (IPA: [ˈuːranʊs]).[2] It is the only one of the eight planets whose English name derives from a figure of Greek mythology. The adjectival form of Uranus is \"Uranian\".[40] The pronunciation of the name *Uranus* preferred among astronomers is /ˈjʊərənəs/ *YOOR-ə-nəs*,[1] with stress on the first syllable as in Latin *Uranus*, in contrast to /jʊˈreɪnəs/ *yoo-RAY-nəs*, with stress on the second syllable and a long *a*, though both are considered acceptable.[f]\n\n\nConsensus on the name was not reached until almost 70 years after the planet's discovery. During the original discussions following discovery, Maskelyne asked Herschel to \"do the astronomical world the faver [*sic*] to give a name to your planet, which is entirely your own, [and] which we are so much obliged to you for the discovery of\".[42] In response to Maskelyne's request, Herschel decided to name the object *Georgium Sidus* (George's Star), or the \"Georgian Planet\" in honour of his new patron, King George III.[43] He explained this decision in a letter to Joseph Banks:[37]\n\n\n\n\n> In the fabulous ages of ancient times the appellations of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were given to the Planets, as being the names of their principal heroes and divinities. In the present more philosophical era it would hardly be allowable to have recourse to the same method and call it Juno, Pallas, Apollo or Minerva, for a name to our new heavenly body. The first consideration of any particular event, or remarkable incident, seems to be its chronology: if in any future age it should be asked, when this last-found Planet was discovered? It would be a very satisfactory answer to say, 'In the reign of King George the Third'.\n> \n> \n\n\nHerschel's proposed name was not popular outside Britain and Hanover, and alternatives were soon proposed. Astronomer Jérôme Lalande proposed that it be named *Herschel* in honour of its discoverer.[44] Swedish astronomer Erik Prosperin proposed the names Astraea*,* Cybele (now the names of asteroids), and *Neptune*, which would become the name of the next planet to be discovered. The name was supported by other astronomers who liked the idea to commemorate the victories of the British Royal Naval fleet in the course of the American Revolutionary War by calling the new planet even *Neptune George III* or *Neptune Great Britain*, a compromise Lexell suggested as well.[34][45] Daniel Bernoulli, suggested *Hypercronius* and *Transaturnis*. Georg Lichtenberg from Göttingen suggested *Austräa*, a goddess mentioned by Ovid (but who is traditionally associated with Virgo). The name *Minerva* was also proposed.[45]\n\n\nIn a March 1782 treatise, Bode proposed *Uranus*, the Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos.[46] Bode argued that the name should follow the mythology so as not to stand out as different from the other planets, and that Uranus was an appropriate name as the father of the first generation of the Titans.[46] He also noted that elegance of the name in that just as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named after the father of Saturn.[39][46][47][48] Bode was however apparently unaware that *Uranus* was only the Latinised form of the titular deity, and his Roman equivalent was Caelus. In 1789, Bode's Royal Academy colleague Martin Klaproth named his newly discovered element uranium in support of Bode's choice.[49] Ultimately, Bode's suggestion became the most widely used, and became universal in 1850 when HM Nautical Almanac Office, the final holdout, switched from using *Georgium Sidus* to *Uranus*.[47]\n\n\nUranus has two astronomical symbols. The first to be proposed, ![⛢](image),[g] was proposed by Johann Gottfried Köhler at Bode's request in 1782.[50] Köhler suggested that the new planet be given the symbol for platinum, which had been described scientifically only 30 years before. As there was no alchemical symbol for platinum, he suggested ⛢ or ⛢, a combination of the planetary-metal symbols ☉ (gold) and ♂ (iron), as platinum (or 'white gold') is found mixed with iron. Bode thought that an upright orientation, ⛢, fit better with the symbols for the other planets while remaining distinct.[50] This symbol predominates in modern astronomical use in the rare cases that symbols are used at all.[51][52] The second symbol, ![♅](image),[h] was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as \"*un globe surmonté par la première lettre de votre nom*\" (\"a globe surmounted by the first letter of your surname\").[44] The second symbol is nearly universal in astrology.\n\n\nUranus is called by a variety of names in other languages. Uranus's name is literally translated as the \"sky king star\" in Chinese (天王星), Japanese (天王星), Korean (천왕성), and Vietnamese (*sao Thiên Vương*).[53][54][55][56] In Thai, its official name is *Dao Yurenat* (ดาวยูเรนัส), as in English. Its other name in Thai is *Dao Maruettayu* (ดาวมฤตยู, Star of Mṛtyu), after the Sanskrit word for 'death', *Mrtyu* (मृत्यु). In Mongolian, its name is *Tengeriin Van* (Тэнгэрийн ван), translated as 'King of the Sky', reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the heavens. In Hawaiian, its name is *Heleʻekala*, the Hawaiian rendering of the name 'Herschel'.[57] In Māori, its name is *Whērangi*.[58][59]\n\n\n\n## Formation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Formation and evolution of the Solar System\n\nFor details of the evolution of Uranus's orbit, see Nice model.\n\nIt is argued that the differences between the ice giants and the gas giants arise from their formation history.[60][61][62] The Solar System is hypothesised to have formed from a rotating disk of gas and dust known as the presolar nebula. Much of the nebula's gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, formed the Sun, and the dust grains collected together to form the first protoplanets. As the planets grew, some of them eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold on to the nebula's leftover gas.[60][61][63] The more gas they held onto, the larger they became; the larger they became, the more gas they held onto until a critical point was reached, and their size began to increase exponentially.[64] The ice giants, with only a few Earth masses of nebular gas, never reached that critical point.[60][61][65] Recent simulations of planetary migration have suggested that both ice giants formed closer to the Sun than their present positions, and moved outwards after formation (the Nice model).[60]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\nUranus orbits the Sun once every 84 years. In 2033, the planet will have made its third complete orbit around the Sun since being discovered in 1781. The planet has returned to the point of its discovery northeast of Zeta Tauri twice since then, on 25 March 1865 and 29 March 1949. Uranus will return to this location again on 3 April 2033. Its average distance from the Sun is roughly 20 AU (3 billion km; 2 billion mi). The difference between its minimum and maximum distance from the Sun is 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet, though not as large as that of dwarf planet Pluto.[66] The intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of distance, and so on Uranus (at about 20 times the distance from the Sun compared to Earth) it is about 1/400 the intensity of light on Earth.[67]\n\n\nThe orbital elements of Uranus were first calculated in 1783 by Pierre-Simon Laplace.[68] With time, discrepancies began to appear between predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841, John Couch Adams first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet. In 1845, Urbain Le Verrier began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On 23 September 1846, Johann Gottfried Galle located a new planet, later named Neptune, at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier.[69]\n\n\nThe rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17 hours, 14 minutes. As on all giant planets, its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about 60 degrees south, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours.[70]\n\n\n\n### Axial tilt[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Simulated Earth view of Uranus from 1986 to 2030, from southern summer solstice in 1986 to equinox in 2007 and northern summer solstice in 2028.\nThe Uranian axis of rotation is approximately parallel to the plane of the Solar System, with an axial tilt of 97.77° (as defined by prograde rotation). This gives it seasonal changes completely unlike those of the other planets. (Pluto and the protoplanet-asteroid 2 Pallas also have extreme axial tilts.) Near the solstice, one pole faces the Sun continuously and the other faces away, with only a narrow strip around the equator experiencing a rapid day–night cycle, with the Sun low over the horizon. On the other side of Uranus's orbit, the orientation of the poles towards the Sun is reversed. Each pole gets around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of darkness.[71] Near the time of the equinoxes, the Sun faces the equator of Uranus, giving a period of day–night cycles similar to those seen on most of the other planets.\n\n\nOne result of this axis orientation is that, averaged over the Uranian year, the near-polar regions of Uranus receive a greater energy input from the Sun than its equatorial regions. Nevertheless, Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles. The underlying mechanism that causes this is unknown. The reason for Uranus's unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty, but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth-sized protoplanet collided with Uranus, causing the skewed orientation.[72] Research by Jacob Kegerreis of Durham University suggests that the tilt resulted from a rock larger than Earth crashing into the planet 3 to 4 billion years ago.[73]\nUranus's south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun at the time of *Voyager 2*'s flyby in 1986. The labelling of this pole as \"south\" uses the definition currently endorsed by the International Astronomical Union, namely that the north pole of a planet or satellite is the pole that points above the invariable plane of the Solar System, regardless of the direction the planet is spinning.[74][75] A different convention is sometimes used, in which a body's north and south poles are defined according to the right-hand rule in relation to the direction of rotation.[76]\n\n\n\n\n\nList of solstices and equinoxes[77]\n| Northern hemisphere\n | Year\n | Southern hemisphere\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Winter solstice\n | 1902, 1986, 2069\n | Summer solstice\n |\n| Vernal equinox\n | 1923, 2007, 2092\n | Autumnal equinox\n |\n| Summer solstice\n | 1944, 2030\n | Winter solstice\n |\n| Autumnal equinox\n | 1965, 2050\n | Vernal equinox\n |\n\n\n### Visibility from Earth[edit]\n\n\nThe mean apparent magnitude of Uranus is 5.68 with a standard deviation of 0.17, while the extremes are 5.38 and 6.03.[18] This range of brightness is near the limit of naked eye visibility. Much of the variability is dependent upon the planetary latitudes being illuminated from the Sun and viewed from the Earth.[78] Its angular diameter is between 3.4 and 3.7 arcseconds, compared with 16 to 20 arcseconds for Saturn and 32 to 45 arcseconds for Jupiter.[79] At opposition, Uranus is visible to the naked eye in dark skies, and becomes an easy target even in urban conditions with binoculars.[7] On larger amateur telescopes with an objective diameter of between 15 and 23 cm, Uranus appears as a pale cyan disk with distinct limb darkening. With a large telescope of 25 cm or wider, cloud patterns, as well as some of the larger satellites, such as Titania and Oberon, may be visible.[80]\n\n\n\n## Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Size comparison of Earth and UranusUranus's mass is roughly 14.5 times that of Earth, making it the least massive of the giant planets. Its diameter is slightly larger than Neptune's at roughly four times that of Earth. A resulting density of 1.27 g/cm3 makes Uranus the second least dense planet, after Saturn.[11][12] This value indicates that it is made primarily of various ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane.[16] The total mass of ice in Uranus's interior is not precisely known, because different figures emerge depending on the model chosen; it must be between 9.3 and 13.5 Earth masses.[16][81] Hydrogen and helium constitute only a small part of the total, with between 0.5 and 1.5 Earth masses.[16] The remainder of the non-ice mass (0.5 to 3.7 Earth masses) is accounted for by rocky material.[16]\nThe standard model of Uranus's structure is that it consists of three layers: a rocky (silicate/iron–nickel) core in the centre, an icy mantle in the middle and an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope.[16][82] The core is relatively small, with a mass of only 0.55 Earth masses and a radius less than 20% of Uranus'; the mantle comprises its bulk, with around 13.4 Earth masses, and the upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial, weighing about 0.5 Earth masses and extending for the last 20% of Uranus's radius.[16][82] Uranus's core density is around 9 g/cm3, with a pressure in the centre of 8 million bars (800 GPa) and a temperature of about 5000 K.[81][82] The ice mantle is not in fact composed of ice in the conventional sense, but of a hot and dense fluid consisting of water, ammonia and other volatiles.[16][82] This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean.[83]\n\n![](image)Diagram of the interior of Uranus, listing each layer's composition\nThe extreme pressure and temperature deep within Uranus may break up the methane molecules, with the carbon atoms condensing into crystals of diamond that rain down through the mantle like hailstones.[84][85] This phenomenon is similar to diamond rains that are theorised by scientists to exist on Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune.[86][87] Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may comprise an ocean of metallic liquid carbon, perhaps with floating solid 'diamond-bergs'.[88][89][90]\n\n\nThe bulk compositions of Uranus and Neptune are different from those of Jupiter and Saturn, with ice dominating over gases, hence justifying their separate classification as ice giants. There may be a layer of ionic water where the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions move freely within the oxygen lattice.[91]\n\n\nAlthough the model considered above is reasonably standard, it is not unique; other models also satisfy observations. For instance, if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle, the total mass of ices in the interior will be lower, and, correspondingly, the total mass of rocks and hydrogen will be higher. Presently available data does not allow a scientific determination of which model is correct.[81] The fluid interior structure of Uranus means that it has no solid surface. The gaseous atmosphere gradually transitions into the internal liquid layers.[16] For the sake of convenience, a revolving oblate spheroid set at the point at which atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa) is conditionally designated as a \"surface\". It has equatorial and polar radii of 25,559 ± 4 km (15,881.6 ± 2.5 mi) and 24,973 ± 20 km (15,518 ± 12 mi), respectively.[11] This surface is used throughout this article as a zero point for altitudes.\n\n\n\n### Internal heat[edit]\n\n\nUranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low thermal flux.[22][92] Why Uranus's internal temperature is so low is still not understood. Neptune, which is Uranus's near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun,[22] but Uranus radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by Uranus in the far infrared (i.e. heat) part of the spectrum is 1.06±0.08 times the solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere.[17][93] Uranus's heat flux is only 0.042±0.047 W/m2, which is lower than the internal heat flux of Earth of about 0.075 W/m2.[93] The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49 K (−224.2 °C; −371.5 °F), making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System.[17][93]\n\n\nOne of the hypotheses for this discrepancy suggests that when Uranus was hit by a supermassive impactor, which caused it to expel most of its primordial heat, it was left with a depleted core temperature.[94] This impact hypothesis is also used in some attempts to explain the planet's axial tilt. Another hypothesis is that some form of barrier exists in Uranus's upper layers that prevents the core's heat from reaching the surface.[16] For example, convection may take place in a set of compositionally different layers, which may inhibit upward heat transport;[17][93] perhaps double diffusive convection is a limiting factor.[16]\n\n\nIn a 2021 study, the ice giants' interior conditions were mimicked by compressing water containing minerals like olivine and ferropericlase, thus showing that large amounts of magnesium could be dissolved in the liquid interiors of Uranus and Neptune. If Uranus has more of this magnesium than Neptune, it could form a thermal insulation layer, thus potentially explaining the planet's low temperature.[95]\n\n\n\n## Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Uranus\n\nAlthough there is no well-defined solid surface within Uranus's interior, the outermost part of Uranus's gaseous envelope that is accessible to remote sensing is called its atmosphere.[17] Remote-sensing capability extends down to roughly 300 km below the 1 bar (100 kPa) level, with a corresponding pressure around 100 bar (10 MPa) and temperature of 320 K (47 °C; 116 °F).[96] The tenuous thermosphere extends over two planetary radii from the nominal surface, which is defined to lie at a pressure of 1 bar.[97] The Uranian atmosphere can be divided into three layers: the troposphere, between altitudes of −300 and 50 km (−186 and 31 mi) and pressures from 100 to 0.1 bar (10 MPa to 10 kPa); the stratosphere, spanning altitudes between 50 and 4,000 km (31 and 2,485 mi) and pressures of between 0.1 and 10−10 bar (10 kPa to 10 µPa); and the thermosphere extending from 4,000 km to as high as 50,000 km from the surface.[17] There is no mesosphere.\n\n\n\n### Composition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of the Uranus atmosphere's composition and layers, along with the graph of its pressure\nThe composition of Uranus's atmosphere is different from its bulk, consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium.[17] The helium molar fraction, i.e. the number of helium atoms per molecule of gas, is 0.15±0.03[21] in the upper troposphere, which corresponds to a mass fraction 0.26±0.05.[17][93] This value is close to the protosolar helium mass fraction of 0.275±0.01,[98] indicating that helium has not settled in its centre as it has in the gas giants.[17] The third-most-abundant component of Uranus's atmosphere is methane (CH4).[17] Methane has prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared (IR), making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour.[17] Methane molecules account for 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction below the methane cloud deck at the pressure level of 1.3 bar (130 kPa); this represents about 20 to 30 times the carbon abundance found in the Sun.[17][20][99]\n\n\nThe mixing ratio[i] is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to its extremely low temperature, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out.[100] The abundances of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere are poorly known. They are probably also higher than solar values.[17][101] Along with methane, trace amounts of various hydrocarbons are found in the stratosphere of Uranus, which are thought to be produced from methane by photolysis induced by the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation.[102] They include ethane (C2H6), acetylene (C2H2), methylacetylene (CH3C2H), and diacetylene (C2HC2H).[100][103][104] Spectroscopy has also uncovered traces of water vapour, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere, which can only originate from an external source such as infalling dust and comets.[103][104][105]\n\n\n\n### Troposphere[edit]\n\n\nThe troposphere is the lowest and densest part of the atmosphere and is characterised by a decrease in temperature with altitude.[17] The temperature falls from about 320 K (47 °C; 116 °F) at the base of the nominal troposphere at −300 km to 53 K (−220 °C; −364 °F) at 50 km.[96][99] The temperatures in the coldest upper region of the troposphere (the tropopause) actually vary in the range between 49 and 57 K (−224 and −216 °C; −371 and −357 °F) depending on planetary latitude.[17][92] The tropopause region is responsible for the vast majority of Uranus's thermal far infrared emissions, thus determining its effective temperature of 59.1 ± 0.3 K (−214.1 ± 0.3 °C; −353.3 ± 0.5 °F).[92][93]\n\n\nThe troposphere is thought to have a highly complex cloud structure; water clouds are hypothesised to lie in the pressure range of 50 to 100 bar (5 to 10 MPa), ammonium hydrosulfide clouds in the range of 20 to 40 bar (2 to 4 MPa), ammonia or hydrogen sulfide clouds at between 3 and 10 bar (0.3 and 1 MPa) and finally directly detected thin methane clouds at 1 to 2 bar (0.1 to 0.2 MPa).[17][20][96][106] The troposphere is a dynamic part of the atmosphere, exhibiting strong winds, bright clouds and seasonal changes.[22]\n\n\n\n### Upper atmosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Uranus's upper atmosphere taken during the Outer Planet Atmosphere Legacy (OPAL) program.[107]\nThe middle layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the stratosphere, where temperature generally increases with altitude from 53 K (−220 °C; −364 °F) in the tropopause to between 800 and 850 K (527 and 577 °C; 980 and 1,070 °F) at the base of the thermosphere.[97] The heating of the stratosphere is caused by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and other hydrocarbons,[108] which form in this part of the atmosphere as a result of methane photolysis.[102] Heat is also conducted from the hot thermosphere.[108] The hydrocarbons occupy a relatively narrow layer at altitudes of between 100 and 300 km corresponding to a pressure range of 1000 to 10 Pa and temperatures of between 75 and 170 K (−198 and −103 °C; −325 and −154 °F).[100][103]\n\n\nThe most abundant hydrocarbons are methane, acetylene and ethane with mixing ratios of around 10−7 relative to hydrogen. The mixing ratio of carbon monoxide is similar at these altitudes.[100][103][105] Heavier hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide have mixing ratios three orders of magnitude lower.[103] The abundance ratio of water is around 7×10−9.[104] Ethane and acetylene tend to condense in the colder lower part of the stratosphere and tropopause (below 10 mBar level) forming haze layers,[102] which may be partly responsible for the bland appearance of Uranus. The concentration of hydrocarbons in the Uranian stratosphere above the haze is significantly lower than in the stratospheres of the other giant planets.[100][109]\n\n\n\n![](image)Planet Uranus - North Pole - Cyclone (VLA; October 2021)\nThe outermost layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the thermosphere and corona, which has a uniform temperature around 800 K (527 °C) to 850 K (577 °C).[17][109] The heat sources necessary to sustain such a high level are not understood, as neither the solar UV nor the auroral activity can provide the necessary energy to maintain these temperatures. The weak cooling efficiency due to the lack of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere above 0.1 mBar pressure levels may contribute too.[97][109] In addition to molecular hydrogen, the thermosphere-corona contains many free hydrogen atoms. Their small mass and high temperatures explain why the corona extends as far as 50,000 km (31,000 mi), or two Uranian radii, from its surface.[97][109]\n\n\nThis extended corona is a unique feature of Uranus.[109] Its effects include a drag on small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings.[97] The Uranian thermosphere, together with the upper part of the stratosphere, corresponds to the ionosphere of Uranus.[99] Observations show that the ionosphere occupies altitudes from 2,000 to 10,000 km (1,200 to 6,200 mi).[99] The Uranian ionosphere is denser than that of either Saturn or Neptune, which may arise from the low concentration of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere.[109][110] The ionosphere is mainly sustained by solar UV radiation and its density depends on the solar activity.[111] Auroral activity is insignificant as compared to Jupiter and Saturn.[109][112]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Uranus\n\nAt ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, Uranus's atmosphere is bland in comparison to the other giant planets, even to Neptune, which it otherwise closely resembles.[22] When *Voyager 2* flew by Uranus in 1986, it observed a total of 10 cloud features across the entire planet.[113][114] One proposed explanation for this dearth of features is that Uranus's internal heat is markedly lower than that of the other giant planets, as stated previously Uranus is the coldest planet in the Solar System.[17][93]\n\n\n\n### Banded structure, winds and clouds[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Voyager 2*'s timelapse of Uranus's dynamic atmosphere\nIn 1986, *Voyager 2* found that the visible southern hemisphere of Uranus can be subdivided into two regions: a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands.[113] Their boundary is located at about −45° of latitude. A narrow band straddling the latitudinal range from −45 to −50° is the brightest large feature on its visible surface.[113][115] It is called a southern \"collar\". The cap and collar are thought to be a dense region of methane clouds located within the pressure range of 1.3 to 2 bar (see above).[116] Besides the large-scale banded structure, *Voyager 2* observed ten small bright clouds, most lying several degrees to the north from the collar.[113] In all other respects, Uranus looked like a dynamically dead planet in 1986.\n\n\n*Voyager 2* arrived during the height of Uranus's southern summer and could not observe the northern hemisphere. At the beginning of the 21st century, when the northern polar region came into view, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Keck telescope initially observed neither a collar nor a polar cap in the northern hemisphere.[115] So Uranus appeared to be asymmetric: bright near the south pole and uniformly dark in the region north of the southern collar.[115] In 2007, when Uranus passed its equinox, the southern collar almost disappeared, and a faint northern collar emerged near 45° of latitude.[117] In 2023, a team employing the Very Large Array observed a dark collar at 80° latitude, and a bright spot at the north pole, indicating the presence of a polar vortex.[118]\n\n\n\n![](image)The first dark spot observed on Uranus. Image obtained by the HST ACS in 2006.\nIn the 1990s, the number of the observed bright cloud features grew considerably, partly because new high-resolution imaging techniques became available.[22] Most were found in the northern hemisphere as it started to become visible.[22] An early explanation—that bright clouds are easier to identify in its dark part, whereas in the southern hemisphere the bright collar masks them – was shown to be incorrect.[119][120] Nevertheless, there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere. The northern clouds are smaller, sharper and brighter.[120] They appear to lie at a higher altitude.[120] The lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude. Some small clouds live for hours; at least one southern cloud may have persisted since the *Voyager 2* flyby.[22][114] Recent observation also discovered that cloud features on Uranus have a lot in common with those on Neptune.[22] For example, the dark spots common on Neptune had never been observed on Uranus before 2006, when the first such feature dubbed Uranus Dark Spot was imaged.[121] The speculation is that Uranus is becoming more Neptune-like during its equinoctial season.[122]\n\n\nThe tracking of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds blowing in the upper troposphere of Uranus.[22] At the equator winds are retrograde, which means that they blow in the reverse direction to the planetary rotation. Their speeds are from −360 to −180 km/h (−220 to −110 mph).[22][115] Wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator, reaching zero values near ±20° latitude, where the troposphere's temperature minimum is located.[22][92] Closer to the poles, the winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with Uranus's rotation. Wind speeds continue to increase reaching maxima at ±60° latitude before falling to zero at the poles.[22] Wind speeds at −40° latitude range from 540 to 720 km/h (340 to 450 mph). Because the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel, speeds between it and the southern pole are impossible to measure.[22] In contrast, in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as 860 km/h (540 mph) are observed near +50° latitude.[22][115][123]\n\n\n\n### Seasonal variation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Uranus in 2005. Rings, southern collar and a bright cloud in the northern hemisphere are visible (HST ACS image).\nFor a short period from March to May 2004, large clouds appeared in the Uranian atmosphere, giving it a Neptune-like appearance.[120][124] Observations included record-breaking wind speeds of 820 km/h (510 mph) and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as \"Fourth of July fireworks\".[114] On 23 August 2006, researchers at the Space Science Institute (Boulder, Colorado) and the University of Wisconsin observed a dark spot on Uranus's surface, giving scientists more insight into Uranus atmospheric activity.[121] Why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known, but it appears that Uranus's extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather.[125][122] Determining the nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on Uranus's atmosphere has existed for less than 84 years, or one full Uranian year. Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes.[126] A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s.[127] Stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice.[108] The majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in viewing geometry.[119]\n\n\nThere are some indications that physical seasonal changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus is known to have a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above.[122] During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim.[126] This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox.[122] Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes in brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the meridional albedo patterns.[122]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground-based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright),[116] whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity,[114] such as cloud formations and stronger winds, bolstering expectations that it should brighten soon.[120] This indeed happened in 2007 when it passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, and the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric, with northern winds being somewhat slower than southern.[117]\n\n\nThe mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear.[122] Near the summer and winter solstices, Uranus's hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere.[116] The bright collar at −45° latitude is also connected with methane clouds.[116] Other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers.[116] The variation of the microwave emission from Uranus is probably caused by changes in the deep tropospheric circulation, because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.[128] Now that the spring and autumn equinoxes are arriving on Uranus, the dynamics are changing and convection can occur again.[114][128]\n\n\n\n## Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The magnetic field of Uranus  \n(animated; 25 March 2020)\nBefore the arrival of *Voyager 2*, no measurements of the Uranian magnetosphere had been taken, so its nature remained a mystery. Before 1986, scientists had expected the magnetic field of Uranus to be in line with the solar wind, because it would then align with Uranus's poles that lie in the ecliptic.[129]\n\n\n*Voyager*'s observations revealed that Uranus's magnetic field is peculiar, both because it does not originate from its geometric centre, and because it is tilted at 59° from the axis of rotation.[129][130] In fact, the magnetic dipole is shifted from Uranus's centre towards the south rotational pole by as much as one-third of the planetary radius.[129] This unusual geometry results in a highly asymmetric magnetosphere, where the magnetic field strength on the surface in the southern hemisphere can be as low as 0.1 gauss (10 µT), whereas in the northern hemisphere it can be as high as 1.1 gauss (110 µT).[129] The average field at the surface is 0.23 gauss (23 µT).[129]\n\n\n\n![](image)A diagram showing Uranus's asymmetric magnetosphere\nStudies of *Voyager 2* data in 2017 suggest that this asymmetry causes Uranus's magnetosphere to connect with the solar wind once a Uranian day, opening the planet to the Sun's particles.[131] In comparison, the magnetic field of Earth is roughly as strong at either pole, and its \"magnetic equator\" is roughly parallel with its geographical equator.[130] The dipole moment of Uranus is 50 times that of Earth.[129][130] Neptune has a similarly displaced and tilted magnetic field, suggesting that this may be a common feature of ice giants.[130] One hypothesis is that, unlike the magnetic fields of the terrestrial and gas giants, which are generated within their cores, the ice giants' magnetic fields are generated by motion at relatively shallow depths, for instance, in the water–ammonia ocean.[83][132] Another possible explanation for the magnetosphere's alignment is that there are oceans of liquid diamond in Uranus's interior that would deter the magnetic field.[89]\n\n\n\nDespite its curious alignment, in other respects the Uranian magnetosphere is like those of other planets: it has a bow shock at about 23 Uranian radii ahead of it, a magnetopause at 18 Uranian radii, a fully developed magnetotail, and radiation belts.[129][130][133] Overall, the structure of Uranus's magnetosphere is different from Jupiter's and more similar to Saturn's.[129][130] Uranus's magnetotail trails behind it into space for millions of kilometres and is twisted by its sideways rotation into a long corkscrew.[129][134]\n\n![](image)Aurorae on Uranus taken by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) installed on Hubble.[135]Uranus's magnetosphere contains charged particles: mainly protons and electrons, with a small amount of H2+ ions.[130][133] Many of these particles probably derive from the thermosphere.[133] The ion and electron energies can be as high as 4 and 1.2 megaelectronvolts, respectively.[133] The density of low-energy (below 1 kiloelectronvolt) ions in the inner magnetosphere is about 2 cm−3.[136] The particle population is strongly affected by the Uranian moons, which sweep through the magnetosphere, leaving noticeable gaps.[133] The particle flux is high enough to cause darkening or space weathering of their surfaces on an astronomically rapid timescale of 100,000 years.[133] This may be the cause of the uniformly dark colouration of the Uranian satellites and rings.[137]\n\n\nUranus has relatively well developed aurorae, which are seen as bright arcs around both magnetic poles.[109] Unlike Jupiter's, Uranus's aurorae seem to be insignificant for the energy balance of the planetary thermosphere.[112] In March 2020, NASA astronomers reported the detection of a large atmospheric magnetic bubble, also known as a plasmoid, released into outer space from the planet Uranus, after reevaluating old data recorded by the *Voyager 2* space probe during a flyby of the planet in 1986.[138][139]\n\n\n\n## Moons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Uranus\n\nSee also: Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons\n\n![](image)Major moons of Uranus in order of increasing distance (left to right), at their proper relative sizes and albedos. From left to right, they are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. (collage of *Voyager 2* photographs)\n![](image)Uranus and six moons taken by the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam.\nUranus has 27 known natural satellites.[65] The names of these satellites are chosen from characters in the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.[82][140] The five main satellites are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.[82] The Uranian satellite system is the least massive among those of the giant planets; the combined mass of the five major satellites would be less than half that of Triton (largest moon of Neptune) alone.[12] The largest of Uranus's satellites, Titania, has a radius of only 788.9 km (490.2 mi), or less than half that of the Moon, but slightly more than Rhea, the second-largest satellite of Saturn, making Titania the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System. Uranus's satellites have relatively low albedos; ranging from 0.20 for Umbriel to 0.35 for Ariel (in green light).[113] They are ice–rock conglomerates composed of roughly 50% ice and 50% rock. The ice may include ammonia and carbon dioxide.[137][141]\n\n\nAmong the Uranian satellites, Ariel appears to have the youngest surface, with the fewest impact craters, and Umbriel the oldest.[113][137] Miranda has fault canyons 20 km (12 mi) deep, terraced layers, and a chaotic variation in surface ages and features.[113] Miranda's past geologic activity is thought to have been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently, probably as a result of a former 3:1 orbital resonance with Umbriel.[142] Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are the likely origin of Miranda's 'racetrack'-like coronae.[143][144] Ariel is thought to have once been held in a 4:1 resonance with Titania.[145]\n\n\nUranus has at least one horseshoe orbiter occupying the Sun–Uranus L3 Lagrangian point—a gravitationally unstable region at 180° in its orbit, 83982 Crantor.[146][147] Crantor moves inside Uranus's co-orbital region on a complex, temporary horseshoe orbit.\n2010 EU65 is also a promising Uranus horseshoe librator candidate.[147]\n\n\n\n## Rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Uranus\n\n![](image)Uranus's rings and atmosphere as imaged by the James Webb Space Telescope's near-infrared camera.The Uranian rings are composed of extremely dark particles, which vary in size from micrometres to a fraction of a metre.[113] Thirteen distinct rings are presently known, the brightest being the ε ring. All except the two rings of Uranus are extremely narrow – they are usually a few kilometres wide. The rings are probably quite young; the dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with Uranus. The matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon (or moons) that was shattered by high-speed impacts. From numerous pieces of debris that formed as a result of those impacts, only a few particles survived, in stable zones corresponding to the locations of the present rings.[137][148]\n\n\nWilliam Herschel described a possible ring around Uranus in 1789. This sighting is generally considered doubtful, because the rings are quite faint, and in the two following centuries none were noted by other observers. Still, Herschel made an accurate description of the epsilon ring's size, its angle relative to Earth, its red colour, and its apparent changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun.[149][150] The ring system was definitively discovered on 10 March 1977 by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory. The discovery was serendipitous; they planned to use the occultation of the star SAO 158687 (also known as HD 128598) by Uranus to study its atmosphere. When their observations were analysed, they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind Uranus. They concluded that there must be a ring system around Uranus.[151] Later they detected four additional rings.[151] The rings were directly imaged when *Voyager 2* passed Uranus in 1986.[113] *Voyager 2* also discovered two additional faint rings, bringing the total number to eleven.[113]\n\n\nIn December 2005, the Hubble Space Telescope detected a pair of previously unknown rings. The largest is located twice as far from Uranus as the previously known rings. These new rings are so far from Uranus that they are called the \"outer\" ring system. Hubble also spotted two small satellites, one of which, Mab, shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring. The new rings bring the total number of Uranian rings to 13.[152] In April 2006, images of the new rings from the Keck Observatory yielded the colours of the outer rings: the outermost is blue and the other one red.[153][154] One hypothesis concerning the outer ring's blue colour is that it is composed of minute particles of water ice from the surface of Mab that are small enough to scatter blue light.[153][155] In contrast, Uranus's inner rings appear grey.[153]\n\n\nAlthough the Uranian rings are very difficult to directly observe from Earth, advances in digital imaging have allowed several amateur astronomers to successfully photograph the rings with red or infrared filters; telescopes with apertures as small as 36 cm (14 inches) may be able to detect the rings with proper imaging equipment.[156]\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Uranus\n\n![](image)Uranus as seen from the *Cassini* spacecraft at Saturn\nLaunched in 1977, *Voyager 2* made its closest approach to Uranus on 24 January 1986, coming within 81,500 km (50,600 mi) of the cloudtops, before continuing its journey to Neptune. The spacecraft studied the structure and chemical composition of Uranus's atmosphere,[99] including its unique weather, caused by its axial tilt of 97.77°. It made the first detailed investigations of its five largest moons and discovered 10 new ones. Voyager 2 examined all nine of the system's known rings and discovered two more.[113][137][157] It also studied the magnetic field, its irregular structure, its tilt and its unique corkscrew magnetotail caused by Uranus's sideways orientation.[129]\n\n\nNo other spacecraft has flown by Uranus since then, though there have been many proposed missions to revisit the Uranus system. The possibility of sending the *Cassini* spacecraft from Saturn to Uranus was evaluated during a mission extension planning phase in 2009, but was ultimately rejected in favour of destroying it in the Saturnian atmosphere,[158] as it would have taken about twenty years to get to the Uranian system after departing Saturn.[158] A Uranus entry probe could use Pioneer Venus Multiprobe heritage and descend to 1–5 atmospheres.[159] A Uranus orbiter and probe was recommended by the 2013–2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey published in 2011; the proposal envisaged launch during 2020–2023 and a 13-year cruise to Uranus.[159] The committee's opinion was reaffirmed in 2022, when a Uranus probe/orbiter mission was placed at the highest priority, due to the lack of knowledge about ice giants.[160]\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\n* In astrology, the planet Uranus (symbol ![Uranus's astrological symbol](image)) is the ruling planet of Aquarius. Because Uranus is cyan and Uranus is associated with electricity, the colour electric blue, which is close to cyan, is associated with the sign Aquarius[161] (see Uranus in astrology).\n* The chemical element uranium, discovered in 1789 by the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, was named after the then-newly discovered Uranus.[162]\n* Lydia Sigourney included her poem ![](image) The Georgian Planet in her 1827 collection of poetry.\n* \"Uranus, the Magician\" is a movement in Gustav Holst's orchestral suite *The Planets*, written between 1914 and 1916.\n* Operation Uranus was the successful military operation in World War II by the Red Army to take back Stalingrad and marked the turning point in the land war against the Wehrmacht.\n* The lines \"Then felt I like some watcher of the skies/When a new planet swims into his ken\", from John Keats's \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\", are a reference to Herschel's discovery of Uranus.[163]\n* In English language popular culture, humor is often derived from the common pronunciation of Uranus' name, which resembles that of the phrase \"your anus\".[164]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2011 QF99 and 2014 YX49, the only two known Uranus trojans\n* Colonisation of Uranus\n* Extraterrestrial diamonds (thought to be abundant in Uranus)\n* Outline of Uranus\n* Statistics of planets in the Solar System\n* Uranus in astrology\n* Uranus in fiction\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  These are the mean elements from VSOP87, together with derived quantities.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g***  Refers to the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure.\n3. **^**  Calculated using data from Seidelmann, 2007.[11]\n4. **^**  Based on the volume within the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure.\n5. **^**  Calculation of He, H2 and CH4 molar fractions is based on a 2.3% mixing ratio of methane to hydrogen and the 15/85 He/H2 proportions measured at the tropopause.\n6. **^**  Because, in the English-speaking world, the latter sounds like \"your anus\", the former pronunciation also saves embarrassment: as Pamela Gay, an astronomer at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, noted on her podcast, to avoid \"being made fun of by any small schoolchildren ... when in doubt, don't emphasise anything and just say /ˈjʊərənəs/.

Meines Erachtens muß man bei dieser Wahl die Mythologie befolgen, aus welcher die uralten Namen der übrigen Planeten entlehnen worden; denn in der Reihe der bisher bekannten, würde der von einer merkwürdigen Person oder Begebenheit der neuern Zeit wahrgenommene Name eines Planeten sehr auffallen. Diodor von Cicilien erzahlt die Geschichte der Atlanten, eines uralten Volks, welches eine der fruchtbarsten Gegenden in Africa bewohnte, und die Meeresküsten seines Landes als das Vaterland der Götter ansah. Uranus war ihr, erster König, Stifter ihres gesitteter Lebens und Erfinder vieler nützlichen Künste.

In my view, it is necessary to follow the mythology in this election, which had been borrowed from the ancient name of the other planets; because in the series of previously known, perceived by a strange person or event of modern times name of a planet would very noticeable. Diodorus of Cilicia tells the story of Atlas, an ancient people that inhabited one of the most fertile areas in Africa, and looked at the sea shores of his country as the homeland of the gods. Uranus was her first king, founder of their civilized life and inventor of many useful arts. At the same time he is also described as a diligent and skilful astronomers of antiquity ... even more: Uranus was the father of Saturn and the Atlas, as the former is the father of Jupiter.\n> \n>\n47. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \nLittmann, Mark (2004). *Planets Beyond: Discovering the Outer Solar System*.

It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F) out of all Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 97.8° with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84 Earth years orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness. \n\n\nUranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System's planets. Based on current models, inside its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amounts of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide (thought to have been originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere, such as its peak wind speed of 900 km/h (560 mph),[22] variations in its polar cap and its erratic cloud formation. The planet also has very low internal heat compared to other giant planets, which is still unexplained. \n\n\nLike the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, orbiting natural satellites and a magnetosphere. Its ring system is extremely dark, with only about 2% of the incoming light reflected, and contains the known 13 inner moons. Further out are the larger five major moons of the planet: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon; and orbiting at much greater distance from Uranus are the known nine irregular moons. The planet's magnetosphere is highly asymmetric and has many charged particles, which may cause the darkening of its rings and moons.\n\n\nUranus is visible to the naked eye, but it is very dim and was not classified as a planet until 1781, when it was first observed by William Herschel. About seven decades after its discovery, consensus was reached that the planet be named from the Greek god Uranus (Ouranos), one of the Greek primordial deities. As of 2023, it was visited up close only once when in 1986 the *Voyager 2* probe flew by the planet.[23] Though nowadays it can be resolved and observed by telescopes, there is much desire to revisit the planet, as shown by Planetary Science Decadal Survey's decision to make the proposed Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission a top priority in the 2023–2032 survey.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Position of Uranus (marked with a cross) on the date of its discovery, March 13th, 1781\nLike the classical planets, Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.[24] Sir William Herschel first observed Uranus on 13 March 1781, leading to its discovery as a planet, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time in history and making Uranus the first planet classified as such with the aid of a telescope.\n\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nUranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet, but it was generally mistaken for a star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by Hipparchus, who in 128 BC might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into Ptolemy's *Almagest*.[25] The earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed observed it at least six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769,[26] including on four consecutive nights.\n\n\nSir William Herschel observed Uranus on 13 March 1781 from the garden of his house at 19 New King Street in Bath, Somerset, England (now the Herschel Museum of Astronomy),[27] and initially reported it (on 26 April 1781) as a comet.[28] With a homemade 6.2-inch reflecting telescope, Herschel \"engaged in a series of observations on the parallax of the fixed stars.\"[29][30]\n\n\nHerschel recorded in his journal: \"In the quartile near ζ Tauri ... either [a] Nebulous star or perhaps a comet.\"[31] On 17 March he noted: \"I looked for the Comet or Nebulous Star and found that it is a Comet, for it has changed its place.\"[32] When he presented his discovery to the Royal Society, he continued to assert that he had found a comet, but also implicitly compared it to a planet:[29]\n\n\n\n\n> The power I had on when I first saw the comet was 227. From experience I know that the diameters of the fixed stars are not proportionally magnified with higher powers, as planets are; therefore I now put the powers at 460 and 932, and found that the diameter of the comet increased in proportion to the power, as it ought to be, on the supposition of its not being a fixed star, while the diameters of the stars to which I compared it were not increased in the same ratio. Moreover, the comet being magnified much beyond what its light would admit of, appeared hazy and ill-defined with these great powers, while the stars preserved that lustre and distinctness which from many thousand observations I knew they would retain. The sequel has shown that my surmises were well-founded, this proving to be the Comet we have lately observed.[29]\n> \n> \n\n\nHerschel notified the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne of his discovery and received this flummoxed reply from him on 23 April 1781: \"I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it.\"[33]\n\n\nAlthough Herschel continued to describe his new object as a comet, other astronomers had already begun to suspect otherwise. Finnish-Swedish astronomer Anders Johan Lexell, working in Russia, was the first to compute the orbit of the new object.[34] Its nearly circular orbit led him to the conclusion that it was a planet rather than a comet. Berlin astronomer Johann Elert Bode described Herschel's discovery as \"a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of Saturn\".[35] Bode concluded that its near-circular orbit was more like a planet's than a comet's.[36]\n\n\nThe object was soon universally accepted as a new planet. By 1783, Herschel acknowledged this to Royal Society president Joseph Banks: \"By the observation of the most eminent Astronomers in Europe it appears that the new star, which I had the honour of pointing out to them in March 1781, is a Primary Planet of our Solar System.\"[37] In recognition of his achievement, King George III gave Herschel an annual stipend of £200 (equivalent to £30,000 in 2023)[38] on condition that he moved to Windsor so that the Royal Family could look through his telescopes.[39]\n\n\n\n### Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name Uranus references the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus (Ancient Greek: Οὐρανός), known as Caelus in Roman mythology, the father of Cronus (Saturn) and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter), which was rendered as *Uranus* in Latin (IPA: [ˈuːranʊs]).[2] It is the only one of the eight planets whose English name derives from a figure of Greek mythology. The adjectival form of Uranus is \"Uranian\".[40] The pronunciation of the name *Uranus* preferred among astronomers is /ˈjʊərənəs/ *YOOR-ə-nəs*,[1] with stress on the first syllable as in Latin *Uranus*, in contrast to /jʊˈreɪnəs/ *yoo-RAY-nəs*, with stress on the second syllable and a long *a*, though both are considered acceptable.[f]\n\n\nConsensus on the name was not reached until almost 70 years after the planet's discovery. During the original discussions following discovery, Maskelyne asked Herschel to \"do the astronomical world the faver [*sic*] to give a name to your planet, which is entirely your own, [and] which we are so much obliged to you for the discovery of\".[42] In response to Maskelyne's request, Herschel decided to name the object *Georgium Sidus* (George's Star), or the \"Georgian Planet\" in honour of his new patron, King George III.[43] He explained this decision in a letter to Joseph Banks:[37]\n\n\n\n\n> In the fabulous ages of ancient times the appellations of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were given to the Planets, as being the names of their principal heroes and divinities. In the present more philosophical era it would hardly be allowable to have recourse to the same method and call it Juno, Pallas, Apollo or Minerva, for a name to our new heavenly body. The first consideration of any particular event, or remarkable incident, seems to be its chronology: if in any future age it should be asked, when this last-found Planet was discovered? It would be a very satisfactory answer to say, 'In the reign of King George the Third'.\n> \n> \n\n\nHerschel's proposed name was not popular outside Britain and Hanover, and alternatives were soon proposed. Astronomer Jérôme Lalande proposed that it be named *Herschel* in honour of its discoverer.[44] Swedish astronomer Erik Prosperin proposed the names Astraea*,* Cybele (now the names of asteroids), and *Neptune*, which would become the name of the next planet to be discovered. The name was supported by other astronomers who liked the idea to commemorate the victories of the British Royal Naval fleet in the course of the American Revolutionary War by calling the new planet even *Neptune George III* or *Neptune Great Britain*, a compromise Lexell suggested as well.[34][45] Daniel Bernoulli, suggested *Hypercronius* and *Transaturnis*. Georg Lichtenberg from Göttingen suggested *Austräa*, a goddess mentioned by Ovid (but who is traditionally associated with Virgo). The name *Minerva* was also proposed.[45]\n\n\nIn a March 1782 treatise, Bode proposed *Uranus*, the Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos.[46] Bode argued that the name should follow the mythology so as not to stand out as different from the other planets, and that Uranus was an appropriate name as the father of the first generation of the Titans.[46] He also noted that elegance of the name in that just as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named after the father of Saturn.[39][46][47][48] Bode was however apparently unaware that *Uranus* was only the Latinised form of the titular deity, and his Roman equivalent was Caelus. In 1789, Bode's Royal Academy colleague Martin Klaproth named his newly discovered element uranium in support of Bode's choice.[49] Ultimately, Bode's suggestion became the most widely used, and became universal in 1850 when HM Nautical Almanac Office, the final holdout, switched from using *Georgium Sidus* to *Uranus*.[47]\n\n\nUranus has two astronomical symbols. The first to be proposed, ![⛢](image),[g] was proposed by Johann Gottfried Köhler at Bode's request in 1782.[50] Köhler suggested that the new planet be given the symbol for platinum, which had been described scientifically only 30 years before. As there was no alchemical symbol for platinum, he suggested ⛢ or ⛢, a combination of the planetary-metal symbols ☉ (gold) and ♂ (iron), as platinum (or 'white gold') is found mixed with iron. Bode thought that an upright orientation, ⛢, fit better with the symbols for the other planets while remaining distinct.[50] This symbol predominates in modern astronomical use in the rare cases that symbols are used at all.[51][52] The second symbol, ![♅](image),[h] was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as \"*un globe surmonté par la première lettre de votre nom*\" (\"a globe surmounted by the first letter of your surname\").[44] The second symbol is nearly universal in astrology.\n\n\nUranus is called by a variety of names in other languages. Uranus's name is literally translated as the \"sky king star\" in Chinese (天王星), Japanese (天王星), Korean (천왕성), and Vietnamese (*sao Thiên Vương*).[53][54][55][56] In Thai, its official name is *Dao Yurenat* (ดาวยูเรนัส), as in English. Its other name in Thai is *Dao Maruettayu* (ดาวมฤตยู, Star of Mṛtyu), after the Sanskrit word for 'death', *Mrtyu* (मृत्यु). In Mongolian, its name is *Tengeriin Van* (Тэнгэрийн ван), translated as 'King of the Sky', reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the heavens. In Hawaiian, its name is *Heleʻekala*, the Hawaiian rendering of the name 'Herschel'.[57] In Māori, its name is *Whērangi*.[58][59]\n\n\n\n## Formation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Formation and evolution of the Solar System\n\nFor details of the evolution of Uranus's orbit, see Nice model.\n\nIt is argued that the differences between the ice giants and the gas giants arise from their formation history.[60][61][62] The Solar System is hypothesised to have formed from a rotating disk of gas and dust known as the presolar nebula. Much of the nebula's gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, formed the Sun, and the dust grains collected together to form the first protoplanets. As the planets grew, some of them eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold on to the nebula's leftover gas.[60][61][63] The more gas they held onto, the larger they became; the larger they became, the more gas they held onto until a critical point was reached, and their size began to increase exponentially.[64] The ice giants, with only a few Earth masses of nebular gas, never reached that critical point.[60][61][65] Recent simulations of planetary migration have suggested that both ice giants formed closer to the Sun than their present positions, and moved outwards after formation (the Nice model).[60]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\nUranus orbits the Sun once every 84 years. In 2033, the planet will have made its third complete orbit around the Sun since being discovered in 1781. The planet has returned to the point of its discovery northeast of Zeta Tauri twice since then, on 25 March 1865 and 29 March 1949. Uranus will return to this location again on 3 April 2033. Its average distance from the Sun is roughly 20 AU (3 billion km; 2 billion mi). The difference between its minimum and maximum distance from the Sun is 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet, though not as large as that of dwarf planet Pluto.[66] The intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of distance, and so on Uranus (at about 20 times the distance from the Sun compared to Earth) it is about 1/400 the intensity of light on Earth.[67]\n\n\nThe orbital elements of Uranus were first calculated in 1783 by Pierre-Simon Laplace.[68] With time, discrepancies began to appear between predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841, John Couch Adams first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet. In 1845, Urbain Le Verrier began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On 23 September 1846, Johann Gottfried Galle located a new planet, later named Neptune, at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier.[69]\n\n\nThe rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17 hours, 14 minutes. As on all giant planets, its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about 60 degrees south, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours.[70]\n\n\n\n### Axial tilt[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Simulated Earth view of Uranus from 1986 to 2030, from southern summer solstice in 1986 to equinox in 2007 and northern summer solstice in 2028.\nThe Uranian axis of rotation is approximately parallel to the plane of the Solar System, with an axial tilt of 97.77° (as defined by prograde rotation). This gives it seasonal changes completely unlike those of the other planets. (Pluto and the protoplanet-asteroid 2 Pallas also have extreme axial tilts.) Near the solstice, one pole faces the Sun continuously and the other faces away, with only a narrow strip around the equator experiencing a rapid day–night cycle, with the Sun low over the horizon. On the other side of Uranus's orbit, the orientation of the poles towards the Sun is reversed. Each pole gets around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of darkness.[71] Near the time of the equinoxes, the Sun faces the equator of Uranus, giving a period of day–night cycles similar to those seen on most of the other planets.\n\n\nOne result of this axis orientation is that, averaged over the Uranian year, the near-polar regions of Uranus receive a greater energy input from the Sun than its equatorial regions. Nevertheless, Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles. The underlying mechanism that causes this is unknown. The reason for Uranus's unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty, but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth-sized protoplanet collided with Uranus, causing the skewed orientation.[72] Research by Jacob Kegerreis of Durham University suggests that the tilt resulted from a rock larger than Earth crashing into the planet 3 to 4 billion years ago.[73]\nUranus's south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun at the time of *Voyager 2*'s flyby in 1986. The labelling of this pole as \"south\" uses the definition currently endorsed by the International Astronomical Union, namely that the north pole of a planet or satellite is the pole that points above the invariable plane of the Solar System, regardless of the direction the planet is spinning.[74][75] A different convention is sometimes used, in which a body's north and south poles are defined according to the right-hand rule in relation to the direction of rotation.[76]\n\n\n\n\n\nList of solstices and equinoxes[77]\n| Northern hemisphere\n | Year\n | Southern hemisphere\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Winter solstice\n | 1902, 1986, 2069\n | Summer solstice\n |\n| Vernal equinox\n | 1923, 2007, 2092\n | Autumnal equinox\n |\n| Summer solstice\n | 1944, 2030\n | Winter solstice\n |\n| Autumnal equinox\n | 1965, 2050\n | Vernal equinox\n |\n\n\n### Visibility from Earth[edit]\n\n\nThe mean apparent magnitude of Uranus is 5.68 with a standard deviation of 0.17, while the extremes are 5.38 and 6.03.[18] This range of brightness is near the limit of naked eye visibility. Much of the variability is dependent upon the planetary latitudes being illuminated from the Sun and viewed from the Earth.[78] Its angular diameter is between 3.4 and 3.7 arcseconds, compared with 16 to 20 arcseconds for Saturn and 32 to 45 arcseconds for Jupiter.[79] At opposition, Uranus is visible to the naked eye in dark skies, and becomes an easy target even in urban conditions with binoculars.[7] On larger amateur telescopes with an objective diameter of between 15 and 23 cm, Uranus appears as a pale cyan disk with distinct limb darkening. With a large telescope of 25 cm or wider, cloud patterns, as well as some of the larger satellites, such as Titania and Oberon, may be visible.[80]\n\n\n\n## Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Size comparison of Earth and UranusUranus's mass is roughly 14.5 times that of Earth, making it the least massive of the giant planets. Its diameter is slightly larger than Neptune's at roughly four times that of Earth. A resulting density of 1.27 g/cm3 makes Uranus the second least dense planet, after Saturn.[11][12] This value indicates that it is made primarily of various ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane.[16] The total mass of ice in Uranus's interior is not precisely known, because different figures emerge depending on the model chosen; it must be between 9.3 and 13.5 Earth masses.[16][81] Hydrogen and helium constitute only a small part of the total, with between 0.5 and 1.5 Earth masses.[16] The remainder of the non-ice mass (0.5 to 3.7 Earth masses) is accounted for by rocky material.[16]\nThe standard model of Uranus's structure is that it consists of three layers: a rocky (silicate/iron–nickel) core in the centre, an icy mantle in the middle and an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope.[16][82] The core is relatively small, with a mass of only 0.55 Earth masses and a radius less than 20% of Uranus'; the mantle comprises its bulk, with around 13.4 Earth masses, and the upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial, weighing about 0.5 Earth masses and extending for the last 20% of Uranus's radius.[16][82] Uranus's core density is around 9 g/cm3, with a pressure in the centre of 8 million bars (800 GPa) and a temperature of about 5000 K.[81][82] The ice mantle is not in fact composed of ice in the conventional sense, but of a hot and dense fluid consisting of water, ammonia and other volatiles.[16][82] This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean.[83]\n\n![](image)Diagram of the interior of Uranus, listing each layer's composition\nThe extreme pressure and temperature deep within Uranus may break up the methane molecules, with the carbon atoms condensing into crystals of diamond that rain down through the mantle like hailstones.[84][85] This phenomenon is similar to diamond rains that are theorised by scientists to exist on Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune.[86][87] Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may comprise an ocean of metallic liquid carbon, perhaps with floating solid 'diamond-bergs'.[88][89][90]\n\n\nThe bulk compositions of Uranus and Neptune are different from those of Jupiter and Saturn, with ice dominating over gases, hence justifying their separate classification as ice giants. There may be a layer of ionic water where the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions move freely within the oxygen lattice.[91]\n\n\nAlthough the model considered above is reasonably standard, it is not unique; other models also satisfy observations. For instance, if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle, the total mass of ices in the interior will be lower, and, correspondingly, the total mass of rocks and hydrogen will be higher. Presently available data does not allow a scientific determination of which model is correct.[81] The fluid interior structure of Uranus means that it has no solid surface. The gaseous atmosphere gradually transitions into the internal liquid layers.[16] For the sake of convenience, a revolving oblate spheroid set at the point at which atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa) is conditionally designated as a \"surface\". It has equatorial and polar radii of 25,559 ± 4 km (15,881.6 ± 2.5 mi) and 24,973 ± 20 km (15,518 ± 12 mi), respectively.[11] This surface is used throughout this article as a zero point for altitudes.\n\n\n\n### Internal heat[edit]\n\n\nUranus's internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low thermal flux.[22][92] Why Uranus's internal temperature is so low is still not understood. Neptune, which is Uranus's near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun,[22] but Uranus radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by Uranus in the far infrared (i.e. heat) part of the spectrum is 1.06±0.08 times the solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere.[17][93] Uranus's heat flux is only 0.042±0.047 W/m2, which is lower than the internal heat flux of Earth of about 0.075 W/m2.[93] The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49 K (−224.2 °C; −371.5 °F), making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System.[17][93]\n\n\nOne of the hypotheses for this discrepancy suggests that when Uranus was hit by a supermassive impactor, which caused it to expel most of its primordial heat, it was left with a depleted core temperature.[94] This impact hypothesis is also used in some attempts to explain the planet's axial tilt. Another hypothesis is that some form of barrier exists in Uranus's upper layers that prevents the core's heat from reaching the surface.[16] For example, convection may take place in a set of compositionally different layers, which may inhibit upward heat transport;[17][93] perhaps double diffusive convection is a limiting factor.[16]\n\n\nIn a 2021 study, the ice giants' interior conditions were mimicked by compressing water containing minerals like olivine and ferropericlase, thus showing that large amounts of magnesium could be dissolved in the liquid interiors of Uranus and Neptune. If Uranus has more of this magnesium than Neptune, it could form a thermal insulation layer, thus potentially explaining the planet's low temperature.[95]\n\n\n\n## Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Uranus\n\nAlthough there is no well-defined solid surface within Uranus's interior, the outermost part of Uranus's gaseous envelope that is accessible to remote sensing is called its atmosphere.[17] Remote-sensing capability extends down to roughly 300 km below the 1 bar (100 kPa) level, with a corresponding pressure around 100 bar (10 MPa) and temperature of 320 K (47 °C; 116 °F).[96] The tenuous thermosphere extends over two planetary radii from the nominal surface, which is defined to lie at a pressure of 1 bar.[97] The Uranian atmosphere can be divided into three layers: the troposphere, between altitudes of −300 and 50 km (−186 and 31 mi) and pressures from 100 to 0.1 bar (10 MPa to 10 kPa); the stratosphere, spanning altitudes between 50 and 4,000 km (31 and 2,485 mi) and pressures of between 0.1 and 10−10 bar (10 kPa to 10 µPa); and the thermosphere extending from 4,000 km to as high as 50,000 km from the surface.[17] There is no mesosphere.\n\n\n\n### Composition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diagram of the Uranus atmosphere's composition and layers, along with the graph of its pressure\nThe composition of Uranus's atmosphere is different from its bulk, consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium.[17] The helium molar fraction, i.e. the number of helium atoms per molecule of gas, is 0.15±0.03[21] in the upper troposphere, which corresponds to a mass fraction 0.26±0.05.[17][93] This value is close to the protosolar helium mass fraction of 0.275±0.01,[98] indicating that helium has not settled in its centre as it has in the gas giants.[17] The third-most-abundant component of Uranus's atmosphere is methane (CH4).[17] Methane has prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared (IR), making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour.[17] Methane molecules account for 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction below the methane cloud deck at the pressure level of 1.3 bar (130 kPa); this represents about 20 to 30 times the carbon abundance found in the Sun.[17][20][99]\n\n\nThe mixing ratio[i] is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to its extremely low temperature, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out.[100] The abundances of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere are poorly known. They are probably also higher than solar values.[17][101] Along with methane, trace amounts of various hydrocarbons are found in the stratosphere of Uranus, which are thought to be produced from methane by photolysis induced by the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation.[102] They include ethane (C2H6), acetylene (C2H2), methylacetylene (CH3C2H), and diacetylene (C2HC2H).[100][103][104] Spectroscopy has also uncovered traces of water vapour, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere, which can only originate from an external source such as infalling dust and comets.[103][104][105]\n\n\n\n### Troposphere[edit]\n\n\nThe troposphere is the lowest and densest part of the atmosphere and is characterised by a decrease in temperature with altitude.[17] The temperature falls from about 320 K (47 °C; 116 °F) at the base of the nominal troposphere at −300 km to 53 K (−220 °C; −364 °F) at 50 km.[96][99] The temperatures in the coldest upper region of the troposphere (the tropopause) actually vary in the range between 49 and 57 K (−224 and −216 °C; −371 and −357 °F) depending on planetary latitude.[17][92] The tropopause region is responsible for the vast majority of Uranus's thermal far infrared emissions, thus determining its effective temperature of 59.1 ± 0.3 K (−214.1 ± 0.3 °C; −353.3 ± 0.5 °F).[92][93]\n\n\nThe troposphere is thought to have a highly complex cloud structure; water clouds are hypothesised to lie in the pressure range of 50 to 100 bar (5 to 10 MPa), ammonium hydrosulfide clouds in the range of 20 to 40 bar (2 to 4 MPa), ammonia or hydrogen sulfide clouds at between 3 and 10 bar (0.3 and 1 MPa) and finally directly detected thin methane clouds at 1 to 2 bar (0.1 to 0.2 MPa).[17][20][96][106] The troposphere is a dynamic part of the atmosphere, exhibiting strong winds, bright clouds and seasonal changes.[22]\n\n\n\n### Upper atmosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Uranus's upper atmosphere taken during the Outer Planet Atmosphere Legacy (OPAL) program.[107]\nThe middle layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the stratosphere, where temperature generally increases with altitude from 53 K (−220 °C; −364 °F) in the tropopause to between 800 and 850 K (527 and 577 °C; 980 and 1,070 °F) at the base of the thermosphere.[97] The heating of the stratosphere is caused by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and other hydrocarbons,[108] which form in this part of the atmosphere as a result of methane photolysis.[102] Heat is also conducted from the hot thermosphere.[108] The hydrocarbons occupy a relatively narrow layer at altitudes of between 100 and 300 km corresponding to a pressure range of 1000 to 10 Pa and temperatures of between 75 and 170 K (−198 and −103 °C; −325 and −154 °F).[100][103]\n\n\nThe most abundant hydrocarbons are methane, acetylene and ethane with mixing ratios of around 10−7 relative to hydrogen. The mixing ratio of carbon monoxide is similar at these altitudes.[100][103][105] Heavier hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide have mixing ratios three orders of magnitude lower.[103] The abundance ratio of water is around 7×10−9.[104] Ethane and acetylene tend to condense in the colder lower part of the stratosphere and tropopause (below 10 mBar level) forming haze layers,[102] which may be partly responsible for the bland appearance of Uranus. The concentration of hydrocarbons in the Uranian stratosphere above the haze is significantly lower than in the stratospheres of the other giant planets.[100][109]\n\n\n\n![](image)Planet Uranus - North Pole - Cyclone (VLA; October 2021)\nThe outermost layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the thermosphere and corona, which has a uniform temperature around 800 K (527 °C) to 850 K (577 °C).[17][109] The heat sources necessary to sustain such a high level are not understood, as neither the solar UV nor the auroral activity can provide the necessary energy to maintain these temperatures. The weak cooling efficiency due to the lack of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere above 0.1 mBar pressure levels may contribute too.[97][109] In addition to molecular hydrogen, the thermosphere-corona contains many free hydrogen atoms. Their small mass and high temperatures explain why the corona extends as far as 50,000 km (31,000 mi), or two Uranian radii, from its surface.[97][109]\n\n\nThis extended corona is a unique feature of Uranus.[109] Its effects include a drag on small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings.[97] The Uranian thermosphere, together with the upper part of the stratosphere, corresponds to the ionosphere of Uranus.[99] Observations show that the ionosphere occupies altitudes from 2,000 to 10,000 km (1,200 to 6,200 mi).[99] The Uranian ionosphere is denser than that of either Saturn or Neptune, which may arise from the low concentration of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere.[109][110] The ionosphere is mainly sustained by solar UV radiation and its density depends on the solar activity.[111] Auroral activity is insignificant as compared to Jupiter and Saturn.[109][112]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Uranus\n\nAt ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, Uranus's atmosphere is bland in comparison to the other giant planets, even to Neptune, which it otherwise closely resembles.[22] When *Voyager 2* flew by Uranus in 1986, it observed a total of 10 cloud features across the entire planet.[113][114] One proposed explanation for this dearth of features is that Uranus's internal heat is markedly lower than that of the other giant planets, as stated previously Uranus is the coldest planet in the Solar System.[17][93]\n\n\n\n### Banded structure, winds and clouds[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Voyager 2*'s timelapse of Uranus's dynamic atmosphere\nIn 1986, *Voyager 2* found that the visible southern hemisphere of Uranus can be subdivided into two regions: a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands.[113] Their boundary is located at about −45° of latitude. A narrow band straddling the latitudinal range from −45 to −50° is the brightest large feature on its visible surface.[113][115] It is called a southern \"collar\". The cap and collar are thought to be a dense region of methane clouds located within the pressure range of 1.3 to 2 bar (see above).[116] Besides the large-scale banded structure, *Voyager 2* observed ten small bright clouds, most lying several degrees to the north from the collar.[113] In all other respects, Uranus looked like a dynamically dead planet in 1986.\n\n\n*Voyager 2* arrived during the height of Uranus's southern summer and could not observe the northern hemisphere. At the beginning of the 21st century, when the northern polar region came into view, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Keck telescope initially observed neither a collar nor a polar cap in the northern hemisphere.[115] So Uranus appeared to be asymmetric: bright near the south pole and uniformly dark in the region north of the southern collar.[115] In 2007, when Uranus passed its equinox, the southern collar almost disappeared, and a faint northern collar emerged near 45° of latitude.[117] In 2023, a team employing the Very Large Array observed a dark collar at 80° latitude, and a bright spot at the north pole, indicating the presence of a polar vortex.[118]\n\n\n\n![](image)The first dark spot observed on Uranus. Image obtained by the HST ACS in 2006.\nIn the 1990s, the number of the observed bright cloud features grew considerably, partly because new high-resolution imaging techniques became available.[22] Most were found in the northern hemisphere as it started to become visible.[22] An early explanation—that bright clouds are easier to identify in its dark part, whereas in the southern hemisphere the bright collar masks them – was shown to be incorrect.[119][120] Nevertheless, there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere. The northern clouds are smaller, sharper and brighter.[120] They appear to lie at a higher altitude.[120] The lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude. Some small clouds live for hours; at least one southern cloud may have persisted since the *Voyager 2* flyby.[22][114] Recent observation also discovered that cloud features on Uranus have a lot in common with those on Neptune.[22] For example, the dark spots common on Neptune had never been observed on Uranus before 2006, when the first such feature dubbed Uranus Dark Spot was imaged.[121] The speculation is that Uranus is becoming more Neptune-like during its equinoctial season.[122]\n\n\nThe tracking of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds blowing in the upper troposphere of Uranus.[22] At the equator winds are retrograde, which means that they blow in the reverse direction to the planetary rotation. Their speeds are from −360 to −180 km/h (−220 to −110 mph).[22][115] Wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator, reaching zero values near ±20° latitude, where the troposphere's temperature minimum is located.[22][92] Closer to the poles, the winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with Uranus's rotation. Wind speeds continue to increase reaching maxima at ±60° latitude before falling to zero at the poles.[22] Wind speeds at −40° latitude range from 540 to 720 km/h (340 to 450 mph). Because the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel, speeds between it and the southern pole are impossible to measure.[22] In contrast, in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as 860 km/h (540 mph) are observed near +50° latitude.[22][115][123]\n\n\n\n### Seasonal variation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Uranus in 2005. Rings, southern collar and a bright cloud in the northern hemisphere are visible (HST ACS image).\nFor a short period from March to May 2004, large clouds appeared in the Uranian atmosphere, giving it a Neptune-like appearance.[120][124] Observations included record-breaking wind speeds of 820 km/h (510 mph) and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as \"Fourth of July fireworks\".[114] On 23 August 2006, researchers at the Space Science Institute (Boulder, Colorado) and the University of Wisconsin observed a dark spot on Uranus's surface, giving scientists more insight into Uranus atmospheric activity.[121] Why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known, but it appears that Uranus's extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather.[125][122] Determining the nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on Uranus's atmosphere has existed for less than 84 years, or one full Uranian year. Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes.[126] A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s.[127] Stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice.[108] The majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in viewing geometry.[119]\n\n\nThere are some indications that physical seasonal changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus is known to have a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above.[122] During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim.[126] This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox.[122] Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes in brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the meridional albedo patterns.[122]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground-based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright),[116] whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity,[114] such as cloud formations and stronger winds, bolstering expectations that it should brighten soon.[120] This indeed happened in 2007 when it passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, and the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric, with northern winds being somewhat slower than southern.[117]\n\n\nThe mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear.[122] Near the summer and winter solstices, Uranus's hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere.[116] The bright collar at −45° latitude is also connected with methane clouds.[116] Other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers.[116] The variation of the microwave emission from Uranus is probably caused by changes in the deep tropospheric circulation, because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.[128] Now that the spring and autumn equinoxes are arriving on Uranus, the dynamics are changing and convection can occur again.[114][128]\n\n\n\n## Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The magnetic field of Uranus  \n(animated; 25 March 2020)\nBefore the arrival of *Voyager 2*, no measurements of the Uranian magnetosphere had been taken, so its nature remained a mystery. Before 1986, scientists had expected the magnetic field of Uranus to be in line with the solar wind, because it would then align with Uranus's poles that lie in the ecliptic.[129]\n\n\n*Voyager*'s observations revealed that Uranus's magnetic field is peculiar, both because it does not originate from its geometric centre, and because it is tilted at 59° from the axis of rotation.[129][130] In fact, the magnetic dipole is shifted from Uranus's centre towards the south rotational pole by as much as one-third of the planetary radius.[129] This unusual geometry results in a highly asymmetric magnetosphere, where the magnetic field strength on the surface in the southern hemisphere can be as low as 0.1 gauss (10 µT), whereas in the northern hemisphere it can be as high as 1.1 gauss (110 µT).[129] The average field at the surface is 0.23 gauss (23 µT).[129]\n\n\n\n![](image)A diagram showing Uranus's asymmetric magnetosphere\nStudies of *Voyager 2* data in 2017 suggest that this asymmetry causes Uranus's magnetosphere to connect with the solar wind once a Uranian day, opening the planet to the Sun's particles.[131] In comparison, the magnetic field of Earth is roughly as strong at either pole, and its \"magnetic equator\" is roughly parallel with its geographical equator.[130] The dipole moment of Uranus is 50 times that of Earth.[129][130] Neptune has a similarly displaced and tilted magnetic field, suggesting that this may be a common feature of ice giants.[130] One hypothesis is that, unlike the magnetic fields of the terrestrial and gas giants, which are generated within their cores, the ice giants' magnetic fields are generated by motion at relatively shallow depths, for instance, in the water–ammonia ocean.[83][132] Another possible explanation for the magnetosphere's alignment is that there are oceans of liquid diamond in Uranus's interior that would deter the magnetic field.[89]\n\n\n\nDespite its curious alignment, in other respects the Uranian magnetosphere is like those of other planets: it has a bow shock at about 23 Uranian radii ahead of it, a magnetopause at 18 Uranian radii, a fully developed magnetotail, and radiation belts.[129][130][133] Overall, the structure of Uranus's magnetosphere is different from Jupiter's and more similar to Saturn's.[129][130] Uranus's magnetotail trails behind it into space for millions of kilometres and is twisted by its sideways rotation into a long corkscrew.[129][134]\n\n![](image)Aurorae on Uranus taken by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) installed on Hubble.[135]Uranus's magnetosphere contains charged particles: mainly protons and electrons, with a small amount of H2+ ions.[130][133] Many of these particles probably derive from the thermosphere.[133] The ion and electron energies can be as high as 4 and 1.2 megaelectronvolts, respectively.[133] The density of low-energy (below 1 kiloelectronvolt) ions in the inner magnetosphere is about 2 cm−3.[136] The particle population is strongly affected by the Uranian moons, which sweep through the magnetosphere, leaving noticeable gaps.[133] The particle flux is high enough to cause darkening or space weathering of their surfaces on an astronomically rapid timescale of 100,000 years.[133] This may be the cause of the uniformly dark colouration of the Uranian satellites and rings.[137]\n\n\nUranus has relatively well developed aurorae, which are seen as bright arcs around both magnetic poles.[109] Unlike Jupiter's, Uranus's aurorae seem to be insignificant for the energy balance of the planetary thermosphere.[112] In March 2020, NASA astronomers reported the detection of a large atmospheric magnetic bubble, also known as a plasmoid, released into outer space from the planet Uranus, after reevaluating old data recorded by the *Voyager 2* space probe during a flyby of the planet in 1986.[138][139]\n\n\n\n## Moons[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Uranus\n\nSee also: Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons\n\n![](image)Major moons of Uranus in order of increasing distance (left to right), at their proper relative sizes and albedos. From left to right, they are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. (collage of *Voyager 2* photographs)\n![](image)Uranus and six moons taken by the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam.\nUranus has 27 known natural satellites.[65] The names of these satellites are chosen from characters in the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.[82][140] The five main satellites are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.[82] The Uranian satellite system is the least massive among those of the giant planets; the combined mass of the five major satellites would be less than half that of Triton (largest moon of Neptune) alone.[12] The largest of Uranus's satellites, Titania, has a radius of only 788.9 km (490.2 mi), or less than half that of the Moon, but slightly more than Rhea, the second-largest satellite of Saturn, making Titania the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System. Uranus's satellites have relatively low albedos; ranging from 0.20 for Umbriel to 0.35 for Ariel (in green light).[113] They are ice–rock conglomerates composed of roughly 50% ice and 50% rock. The ice may include ammonia and carbon dioxide.[137][141]\n\n\nAmong the Uranian satellites, Ariel appears to have the youngest surface, with the fewest impact craters, and Umbriel the oldest.[113][137] Miranda has fault canyons 20 km (12 mi) deep, terraced layers, and a chaotic variation in surface ages and features.[113] Miranda's past geologic activity is thought to have been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently, probably as a result of a former 3:1 orbital resonance with Umbriel.[142] Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are the likely origin of Miranda's 'racetrack'-like coronae.[143][144] Ariel is thought to have once been held in a 4:1 resonance with Titania.[145]\n\n\nUranus has at least one horseshoe orbiter occupying the Sun–Uranus L3 Lagrangian point—a gravitationally unstable region at 180° in its orbit, 83982 Crantor.[146][147] Crantor moves inside Uranus's co-orbital region on a complex, temporary horseshoe orbit.\n2010 EU65 is also a promising Uranus horseshoe librator candidate.[147]\n\n\n\n## Rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Uranus\n\n![](image)Uranus's rings and atmosphere as imaged by the James Webb Space Telescope's near-infrared camera.The Uranian rings are composed of extremely dark particles, which vary in size from micrometres to a fraction of a metre.[113] Thirteen distinct rings are presently known, the brightest being the ε ring. All except the two rings of Uranus are extremely narrow – they are usually a few kilometres wide. The rings are probably quite young; the dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with Uranus. The matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon (or moons) that was shattered by high-speed impacts. From numerous pieces of debris that formed as a result of those impacts, only a few particles survived, in stable zones corresponding to the locations of the present rings.[137][148]\n\n\nWilliam Herschel described a possible ring around Uranus in 1789. This sighting is generally considered doubtful, because the rings are quite faint, and in the two following centuries none were noted by other observers. Still, Herschel made an accurate description of the epsilon ring's size, its angle relative to Earth, its red colour, and its apparent changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun.[149][150] The ring system was definitively discovered on 10 March 1977 by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory. The discovery was serendipitous; they planned to use the occultation of the star SAO 158687 (also known as HD 128598) by Uranus to study its atmosphere. When their observations were analysed, they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind Uranus. They concluded that there must be a ring system around Uranus.[151] Later they detected four additional rings.[151] The rings were directly imaged when *Voyager 2* passed Uranus in 1986.[113] *Voyager 2* also discovered two additional faint rings, bringing the total number to eleven.[113]\n\n\nIn December 2005, the Hubble Space Telescope detected a pair of previously unknown rings. The largest is located twice as far from Uranus as the previously known rings. These new rings are so far from Uranus that they are called the \"outer\" ring system. Hubble also spotted two small satellites, one of which, Mab, shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring. The new rings bring the total number of Uranian rings to 13.[152] In April 2006, images of the new rings from the Keck Observatory yielded the colours of the outer rings: the outermost is blue and the other one red.[153][154] One hypothesis concerning the outer ring's blue colour is that it is composed of minute particles of water ice from the surface of Mab that are small enough to scatter blue light.[153][155] In contrast, Uranus's inner rings appear grey.[153]\n\n\nAlthough the Uranian rings are very difficult to directly observe from Earth, advances in digital imaging have allowed several amateur astronomers to successfully photograph the rings with red or infrared filters; telescopes with apertures as small as 36 cm (14 inches) may be able to detect the rings with proper imaging equipment.[156]\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Uranus\n\n![](image)Uranus as seen from the *Cassini* spacecraft at Saturn\nLaunched in 1977, *Voyager 2* made its closest approach to Uranus on 24 January 1986, coming within 81,500 km (50,600 mi) of the cloudtops, before continuing its journey to Neptune. The spacecraft studied the structure and chemical composition of Uranus's atmosphere,[99] including its unique weather, caused by its axial tilt of 97.77°. It made the first detailed investigations of its five largest moons and discovered 10 new ones. Voyager 2 examined all nine of the system's known rings and discovered two more.[113][137][157] It also studied the magnetic field, its irregular structure, its tilt and its unique corkscrew magnetotail caused by Uranus's sideways orientation.[129]\n\n\nNo other spacecraft has flown by Uranus since then, though there have been many proposed missions to revisit the Uranus system. The possibility of sending the *Cassini* spacecraft from Saturn to Uranus was evaluated during a mission extension planning phase in 2009, but was ultimately rejected in favour of destroying it in the Saturnian atmosphere,[158] as it would have taken about twenty years to get to the Uranian system after departing Saturn.[158] A Uranus entry probe could use Pioneer Venus Multiprobe heritage and descend to 1–5 atmospheres.[159] A Uranus orbiter and probe was recommended by the 2013–2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey published in 2011; the proposal envisaged launch during 2020–2023 and a 13-year cruise to Uranus.[159] The committee's opinion was reaffirmed in 2022, when a Uranus probe/orbiter mission was placed at the highest priority, due to the lack of knowledge about ice giants.[160]\n\n\n\n## In culture[edit]\n\n\n* In astrology, the planet Uranus (symbol ![Uranus's astrological symbol](image)) is the ruling planet of Aquarius. Because Uranus is cyan and Uranus is associated with electricity, the colour electric blue, which is close to cyan, is associated with the sign Aquarius[161] (see Uranus in astrology).\n* The chemical element uranium, discovered in 1789 by the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, was named after the then-newly discovered Uranus.[162]\n* Lydia Sigourney included her poem ![](image) The Georgian Planet in her 1827 collection of poetry.\n* \"Uranus, the Magician\" is a movement in Gustav Holst's orchestral suite *The Planets*, written between 1914 and 1916.\n* Operation Uranus was the successful military operation in World War II by the Red Army to take back Stalingrad and marked the turning point in the land war against the Wehrmacht.\n* The lines \"Then felt I like some watcher of the skies/When a new planet swims into his ken\", from John Keats's \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\", are a reference to Herschel's discovery of Uranus.[163]\n* In English language popular culture, humor is often derived from the common pronunciation of Uranus' name, which resembles that of the phrase \"your anus\".[164]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2011 QF99 and 2014 YX49, the only two known Uranus trojans\n* Colonisation of Uranus\n* Extraterrestrial diamonds (thought to be abundant in Uranus)\n* Outline of Uranus\n* Statistics of planets in the Solar System\n* Uranus in astrology\n* Uranus in fiction\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  These are the mean elements from VSOP87, together with derived quantities.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g***  Refers to the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure.\n3. **^**  Calculated using data from Seidelmann, 2007.[11]\n4. **^**  Based on the volume within the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure.\n5. **^**  Calculation of He, H2 and CH4 molar fractions is based on a 2.3% mixing ratio of methane to hydrogen and the 15/85 He/H2 proportions measured at the tropopause.\n6. **^**  Because, in the English-speaking world, the latter sounds like \"your anus\", the former pronunciation also saves embarrassment: as Pamela Gay, an astronomer at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, noted on her podcast, to avoid \"being made fun of by any small schoolchildren ... when in doubt, don't emphasise anything and just say /ˈjʊərənəs/.

Meines Erachtens muß man bei dieser Wahl die Mythologie befolgen, aus welcher die uralten Namen der übrigen Planeten entlehnen worden; denn in der Reihe der bisher bekannten, würde der von einer merkwürdigen Person oder Begebenheit der neuern Zeit wahrgenommene Name eines Planeten sehr auffallen. Diodor von Cicilien erzahlt die Geschichte der Atlanten, eines uralten Volks, welches eine der fruchtbarsten Gegenden in Africa bewohnte, und die Meeresküsten seines Landes als das Vaterland der Götter ansah. Uranus war ihr, erster König, Stifter ihres gesitteter Lebens und Erfinder vieler nützlichen Künste. Zugleich wird er auch als ein fleißiger und geschickter Himmelsforscher des Alterthums beschrieben... Noch mehr: Uranus war der Vater des Saturns und des Atlas, so wie der erstere der Vater des Jupiters.*\n> \n> \n\n [Translated]: \n> Already in the pre-read at the local Natural History Society on 12th March 1782 treatise, I have the father's name from Saturn, namely Uranos, or as it is usually with the Latin suffix, proposed Uranus, and have since had the pleasure that various astronomers and mathematicians, cited in their writings or letters to me approving this designation. In my view, it is necessary to follow the mythology in this election, which had been borrowed from the ancient name of the other planets; because in the series of previously known, perceived by a strange person or event of modern times name of a planet would very noticeable. Diodorus of Cilicia tells the story of Atlas, an ancient people that inhabited one of the most fertile areas in Africa, and looked at the sea shores of his country as the homeland of the gods. Uranus was her first king, founder of their civilized life and inventor of many useful arts. At the same time he is also described as a diligent and skilful astronomers of antiquity ... even more: Uranus was the father of Saturn and the Atlas, as the former is the father of Jupiter.\n> \n>\n47. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \nLittmann, Mark (2004). *Planets Beyond: Discovering the Outer Solar System*.

It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ![♆](image), representing Neptune's trident.[d]\n\n\nNeptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical predictions rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 14 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by *Voyager 2*, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; *Voyager 2* remains the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune.[18][19] The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.\n\n\nLike the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but contains a higher proportion of *ices* such as water, ammonia and methane. Similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock;[20] both planets are normally considered \"ice giants\" to distinguish them.[21] Along with Rayleigh scattering, traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance.[22] The blue colour is more saturated than the one present on Uranus due to the thinner haze of Neptune's more active atmosphere.[23][24][25]\n\n\nIn contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the *Voyager 2* flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. In 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[26] These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 km/h (580 m/s; 1,300 mph).[27] Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (−218 °C; −361 °F). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C; 9,300 °F).[28][29] Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled \"arcs\"), which was discovered in 1984, then later confirmed by *Voyager 2*.[30]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Discovery of Neptune\n\n![](image)Galileo Galilei\nSome of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo Galilei's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613 contain plotted points that match with what is now known to have been the positions of Neptune on those dates. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky.[31] Hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.[32] In 2009, a study suggested that Galileo was at least aware that the \"star\" he had observed had moved relative to fixed stars.[33]\n\n\nIn 1821, Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of Neptune's neighbour Uranus.[34] Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction.[35] In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had. He requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844. Adams continued to work in 1845–1846 and produced several different estimates of a new planet.[36][37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Urbain Le Verrier\nIn 1845–1846, Urbain Le Verrier, independently of Adams, developed his own calculations but aroused no enthusiasm in his compatriots. In June 1846, upon seeing Le Verrier's first published estimate of the planet's longitude and its similarity to Adams's estimate, Airy persuaded James Challis to search for the planet. Challis vainly scoured the sky throughout August and September.[35][38] Challis had, in fact, observed Neptune a year before the planet's subsequent discoverer, Johann Gottfried Galle, and on two occasions, 4 and 12 August 1845. However, his out-of-date star maps and poor observing techniques meant that he failed to recognise the observations as such until he carried out later analysis. Challis was full of remorse but blamed his neglect on his maps and the fact that he was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.[39][35][40]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Le Verrier sent a letter and urged Berlin Observatory astronomer Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, a student at the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune just northeast of Iota Aquarii, 1° from the \"*five degrees east of Delta Capricorn*\" position Le Verrier had predicted it to be,[41][42] about 12° from Adams's prediction, and on the border of Aquarius and Capricornus according to the modern IAU constellation boundaries.\n\n\nIn the wake of the discovery, there was a heated nationalistic rivalry between the French and the British over who deserved credit for the discovery. Eventually, an international consensus emerged that Le Verrier and Adams deserved joint credit. Since 1966, Dennis Rawlins has questioned the credibility of Adams's claim to co-discovery, and the issue was re-evaluated by historians with the return in 1998 of the \"Neptune papers\" (historical documents) to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.[43][44]\n\n\n\n### Naming[edit]\n\n\nShortly after its discovery, Neptune was referred to simply as \"the planet exterior to Uranus\" or as \"Le Verrier's planet\". The first suggestion for a name came from Galle, who proposed the name *Janus*. In England, Challis put forward the name *Oceanus*.[45]\n\n\nClaiming the right to name his discovery, Le Verrier quickly proposed the name *Neptune* for this new planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes.[46] In October, he sought to name the planet *Le Verrier*, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, François Arago. This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France.[47] French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name *Herschel* for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and *Leverrier* for the new planet.[48]\n\n\nStruve came out in favour of the name *Neptune* on 29 December 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences,[49] after the colour of the planet as viewed through a telescope.[50] Soon, *Neptune* became the internationally accepted name. In Roman mythology, Neptune was the god of the sea, identified with the Greek Poseidon. The demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets, all of which were named for deities in Greek and Roman mythology.[e][51]\n\n\nMost languages today use some variant of the name \"Neptune\" for the planet; indeed, in Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean, the planet's name was translated as \"sea king star\" (海王星).[52][53] In Mongolian, Neptune is called *Dalain van* (Далайн ван), reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the sea. In modern Greek the planet is called *Poseidon* (Ποσειδώνας, *Poseidonas*), the Greek counterpart of Neptune.[54] In Hebrew, *Rahab* (רהב), from a Biblical sea monster mentioned in the Book of Psalms, was selected in a vote managed by the Academy of the Hebrew Language in 2009 as the official name for the planet, even though the existing Latin term *Neptun* (נפטון) is commonly used.[55][56] In Māori, the planet is called *Tangaroa*, named after the Māori god of the sea.[57] In Nahuatl, the planet is called *Tlāloccītlalli*, named after the rain god Tlāloc.[57] In Thai, Neptune is referred to by its Westernised name *Dao Nepchun/Nepjun* (ดาวเนปจูน), but is also called *Dao Ket* (ดาวเกตุ, lit. 'star of Ketu'), after Ketu (केतु), the descending lunar node, who plays a role in Hindu astrology. In Malay, the name *Waruna*, after the Hindu god of seas, is attested as far back as the 1970s,[58] but was eventually superseded by the Latinate equivalents *Neptun* (in Malaysian[59]) or *Neptunus* (in Indonesian[60]).\n\n\nThe usual adjectival form is *Neptunian*. The nonce form *Poseidean* (/pəˈsaɪdiən/), from Poseidon, has also been used,[4] though the usual adjectival form of Poseidon is *Poseidonian* (/ˌpɒsaɪˈdoʊniən/).[61]\n\n\n\n### Status[edit]\n\n\nFrom its discovery in 1846 until the discovery of Pluto in 1930, Neptune was the farthest known planet. When Pluto was discovered, it was considered a planet, and Neptune thus became the second-farthest known planet, except for a 20-year period between 1979 and 1999 when Pluto's elliptical orbit brought it closer than Neptune to the Sun, making Neptune the ninth planet from the Sun during this period.[62][63] The increasingly accurate estimations of Pluto's mass from ten times that of Earth's to far less than that of the Moon[64] and the discovery of the Kuiper belt in 1992 led many astronomers to debate whether Pluto should be considered a planet or as part of the Kuiper belt.[65][66] In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined the word \"planet\" for the first time, reclassifying Pluto as a \"dwarf planet\" and making Neptune once again the outermost-known planet in the Solar System.[67]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A size comparison of Neptune and Earth\nNeptune's mass of 1.0243×1026 kg[7] is intermediate between Earth and the larger gas giants: it is 17 times that of Earth but just 1/19th that of Jupiter.[f] Its gravity at 1 bar is 11.15 m/s2, 1.14 times the surface gravity of Earth,[68] and surpassed only by Jupiter.[69] Neptune's equatorial radius of 24,764 km[10] is nearly four times that of Earth. Neptune, like Uranus, is an ice giant, a subclass of giant planet, because they are smaller and have higher concentrations of volatiles than Jupiter and Saturn.[70] In the search for exoplanets, Neptune has been used as a metonym: discovered bodies of similar mass are often referred to as \"Neptunes\",[71] just as scientists refer to various extrasolar bodies as \"Jupiters\".\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Extraterrestrial diamonds\n\nNeptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5 to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10 to 20% of the way towards the core. Pressure in the atmosphere reaches about 10 GPa, or about 100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere. Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Physical and chemical composition of Neptune's interior\nThe mantle is equivalent to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water, ammonia and methane.[1] As is customary in planetary science, this mixture is referred to as icy even though it is a hot, dense fluid (supercritical fluid). This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean.[72] The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice.[73] At a depth of 7,000 km, the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones.[74][75][76] Scientists also believe that this kind of diamond rain occurs on Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.[77][75] Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the top of the mantle may be an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds'.[78][79][80]\n\n\nThe core of Neptune is likely composed of iron, nickel and silicates, with an interior model giving a mass about 1.2 times that of Earth.[81] The pressure at the centre is 7 Mbar (700 GPa), about twice as high as that at the centre of Earth, and the temperature may be 5,400 K.[28][29]\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Combined colour and near-infrared image of Neptune, showing bands of methane in its atmosphere, and four of its moons, Proteus, Larissa, Galatea, and Despina\nA time-lapse video of Neptune and its moons\nAt high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium.[28] A trace amount of methane is also present. Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue,[82] although Neptune's blue differs from Uranus's milder light blue due to concentrated haze in the latter atmosphere.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Neptune - cloud cover over three decades (1994-2023)[84]\nNeptune's atmosphere is subdivided into two main regions: the lower troposphere, where temperature decreases with altitude, and the stratosphere, where temperature increases with altitude. The boundary between the two, the tropopause, lies at a pressure of 0.1 bars (10 kPa).[21] The stratosphere then gives way to the thermosphere at a pressure lower than 10−5 to 10−4 bars (1 to 10 Pa).[21] The thermosphere gradually transitions to the exosphere.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bands of high-altitude clouds cast shadows on Neptune's lower cloud deck.\nModels suggest that Neptune's troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on altitude.[84] The upper-level clouds lie at pressures below one bar, where the temperature is suitable for methane to condense. For pressures between one and five bars (100 and 500 kPa), clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are thought to form. Above a pressure of five bars, the clouds may consist of ammonia, ammonium sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and water. Deeper clouds of water ice should be found at pressures of about 50 bars (5.0 MPa), where the temperature reaches 273 K (0 °C). Underneath, clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be found.[85]\n\n\nHigh-altitude clouds on Neptune have been observed casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitudes. These circumferential bands have widths of 50–150 km and lie about 50–110 km above the cloud deck.[86] These altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere. Weather does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere. In August 2023, the clouds of Neptune vanished, possibly due to \"solar flare\".[84] Thirty years of observations by Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes showed that Neptune's cloud activity is bound to Solar cycles, and not to the planet's seasons.[87][88]\n\n\nNeptune's spectra suggest that its lower stratosphere is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane, such as ethane and ethyne.[21][28] The stratosphere is also home to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide.[21][89] The stratosphere of Neptune is warmer than that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.[21]\n\n\nFor reasons that remain obscure, the planet's thermosphere is at an anomalously high temperature of about 750 K.[90][91] The planet is too far from the Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.[85][89]\n\n\n\n### Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\nNeptune resembles Uranus in its magnetosphere, with a magnetic field strongly tilted relative to its rotational axis at 47° and offset at least 0.55 radius, or about 13,500 km from the planet's physical centre. Before *Voyager 2*'s arrival at Neptune, it was hypothesised that Uranus's tilted magnetosphere was the result of its sideways rotation. In comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets, scientists now think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in the planets' interiors. This field may be generated by convective fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of electrically conducting liquids (probably a combination of ammonia, methane and water)[85] resulting in a dynamo action.[92]\n\n\nThe dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14 microteslas (0.14 G).[93] The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2 × 1017 T·m3 (14 μT·*R**N*3, where *R**N* is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune may be the result of an offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.[94][95]\n\n\nMeasurements by *Voyager 2* in extreme-ultraviolet and radio frequencies revealed that Neptune has faint and weak but complex and unique aurorae; however, these observations were limited in time and did not contain infrared. Subsequent astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have not glimpsed the aurorae, in contrast to the more well-defined aurorae of Uranus.[96][97]\n\n\nNeptune's bow shock, where the magnetosphere begins to slow the solar wind, occurs at a distance of 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The magnetopause, where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind, lies at a distance of 23–26.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and likely much farther.[94]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Great Dark Spot (top), Scooter (middle white cloud),[98] and the Small Dark Spot (bottom), with contrast exaggerated.\nNeptune's weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm systems, with winds reaching speeds of almost 600 m/s (2,200 km/h; 1,300 mph)—exceeding supersonic flow.[27] More typically, by tracking the motion of persistent clouds, wind speeds have been shown to vary from 20 m/s in the easterly direction to 325 m/s westward.[99] At the cloud tops, the prevailing winds range in speed from 400 m/s along the equator to 250 m/s at the poles.[85] Most of the winds on Neptune move in a direction opposite the planet's rotation.[100] The general pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs. retrograde rotation at lower latitudes. The difference in flow direction is thought to be a \"skin effect\" and not due to any deeper atmospheric processes.[21] At 70° S latitude, a high-speed jet travels at a speed of 300 m/s.[21]\n\n\nNeptune differs from Uranus in its typical level of meteorological activity. *Voyager 2* observed weather phenomena on Neptune during its 1989 flyby,[101] but no comparable phenomena on Uranus during its 1986 fly-by.\n\n\nThe abundance of methane, ethane and acetylene at Neptune's equator is 10–100 times greater than at the poles. This is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at the equator and subsidence near the poles because photochemistry cannot account for the distribution without meridional circulation.[21]\n\n\nIn 2007, it was discovered that the upper troposphere of Neptune's south pole was about 10 K warmer than the rest of its atmosphere, which averages approximately 73 K (−200 °C). The temperature differential is enough to let methane, which elsewhere is frozen in the troposphere, escape into the stratosphere near the pole.[102] The relative \"hot spot\" is due to Neptune's axial tilt, which has exposed the south pole to the Sun for the last quarter of Neptune's year, or roughly 40 Earth years. As Neptune slowly moves towards the opposite side of the Sun, the south pole will be darkened and the north pole illuminated, causing the methane release to shift to the north pole.[103]\n\n\nBecause of seasonal changes, the cloud bands in the southern hemisphere of Neptune have been observed to increase in size and albedo. This trend was first seen in 1980. The long orbital period of Neptune results in seasons lasting forty years.[104]\n\n\n\n### Storms[edit]\n\n\nIn 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anticyclonic storm system spanning 13,000 km × 6,600 km (8,100 mi × 4,100 mi)[101] was discovered by NASA's *Voyager 2* spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.[105]\n\n\nThe Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. This nickname first arose during the months leading up to the *Voyager 2* encounter in 1989, when they were observed moving at speeds faster than the Great Dark Spot (and images acquired later would subsequently reveal the presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by *Voyager 2*).[100] The Small Dark Spot is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It was initially completely dark, but as *Voyager 2* approached the planet, a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.[106] In 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[26] In 2023, the first ground-based observation of a dark spot on Neptune was announced.[107]\n\n\nNeptune's dark spots are thought to occur in the troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features,[108] so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures.[86] Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer.[109] The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other, unknown mechanism.[110]\n\n\n\n* ![The appearance of a Northern Great Dark Spot in 2018 is evidence of a huge storm brewing.[111]](image)\n\nThe appearance of a Northern Great Dark Spot in 2018 is evidence of a huge storm brewing.[111]\n* ![The Northern Great Dark Spot and a smaller companion storm imaged by Hubble in 2020[112]](image)\n\nThe Northern Great Dark Spot and a smaller companion storm imaged by Hubble in 2020[112]\n* ![The Great Dark Spot, as imaged by Voyager 2](image)\n\nThe Great Dark Spot in a color-uncalibrated image by *Voyager 2.*\n* ![Neptune's shrinking vortex[113]](image)\n\nNeptune's shrinking vortex[113]\n\n\n### Internal heating[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Four images taken a few hours apart with the NASA/ESA *Hubble Space Telescope*'s Wide Field Camera 3. Near infrared radiation data has been used as red channel.[114]\nNeptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C).[115] Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun;[116] whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun.[117] Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, and lies over 50% farther from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% of its amount of sunlight,[21] yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.[118]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Neptune (red arc) completes one orbit around the Sun (centre) for every 164.79 orbits of Earth. The light blue object represents Uranus.\nThe average distance between Neptune and the Sun is 4.5 billion km (about 30.1 astronomical units (AU)), and it completes an orbit on average every 164.79 years, subject to a variability of around ±0.1 years. The perihelion distance is 29.81 AU; the aphelion distance is 30.33 AU.[g]\n\n\nOn 11 July 2011, Neptune completed its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846,[120] although it did not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky, because Earth was in a different location in its 365.26 day orbit. Because of the motion of the Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 July 2011.[11][121][122]\n\n\nThe elliptical orbit of Neptune is inclined 1.77° compared to that of Earth.\n\n\nThe axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32°,[123] which is similar to the tilts of Earth (23°) and Mars (25°). As a result, Neptune experiences similar seasonal changes to Earth. The long orbital period of Neptune means that the seasons last for forty Earth years.[104] Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11 hours.[11] Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme.\n\n\nBecause Neptune is not a solid body, its atmosphere undergoes differential rotation. The wide equatorial zone rotates with a period of about 18 hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12 hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System,[124] and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.[86]\n\n\n\n\n### Orbital resonances[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Kuiper belt, resonant trans-Neptunian object, and Neptune trojan\n\n![](image)A diagram showing the major orbital resonances in the Kuiper belt caused by Neptune: the highlighted regions are the 2:3 resonance (plutinos), the nonresonant \"classical belt\" (cubewanos), and the 1:2 resonance (twotinos).\nNeptune's orbit has a profound impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30 AU out to about 55 AU from the Sun.[125] Much in the same way that Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in its structure. The region between 40 and 42 AU is an example.[126]\n\n\nThere do exist orbits within these empty regions where objects can survive for the age of the Solar System. These resonances occur when Neptune's orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the object, such as 1:2, or 3:4. If, say, an object orbits the Sun once for every two Neptune orbits, it will only complete half an orbit by the time Neptune returns to its original position. The most heavily populated resonance in the Kuiper belt, with over 200 known objects,[127] is the 2:3 resonance. Objects in this resonance complete 2 orbits for every 3 of Neptune, and are known as plutinos because the largest of the known Kuiper belt objects, Pluto, is among them.[128] Although Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit regularly, the 2:3 resonance ensures they can never collide.[129] The 3:4, 3:5, 4:7 and 2:5 resonances are less populated.[130]\n\n\nNeptune has a number of known trojan objects occupying both the Sun–Neptune L4 and L5 Lagrangian points—gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing Neptune in its orbit, respectively.[131] Neptune trojans can be viewed as being in a 1:1 resonance with Neptune. Some Neptune trojans are remarkably stable in their orbits, and are likely to have formed alongside Neptune rather than being captured. The first object identified as associated with Neptune's trailing L5 Lagrangian point was 2008 LC18.[132] Neptune also has a temporary quasi-satellite, (309239) 2007 RW10.[133] The object has been a quasi-satellite of Neptune for about 12,500 years and it will remain in that dynamical state for another 12,500 years.[133]\n\n\n\n## Formation and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Formation and evolution of the Solar System and Nice model\n\n![](image)A simulation showing the outer planets and Kuiper belt: a) before Jupiter and Saturn reached a 2:1 resonance; b) after inward scattering of Kuiper belt objects following the orbital shift of Neptune; c) after ejection of scattered Kuiper belt bodies by Jupiter\nThe formation of the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, has proven difficult to model precisely. Current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the Solar System was too low to account for the formation of such large bodies from the traditionally accepted method of core accretion, and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their formation. One is that the ice giants were not formed by core accretion but from instabilities within the original protoplanetary disc and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive OB star.[70]\n\n\nAn alternative concept is that they formed closer to the Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after the removal of the gaseous protoplanetary disc.[134] This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region.[135] The current most widely accepted[136][137][138] explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.\n\n\n\n## Moons and rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Neptune\n\nFor a timeline of discovery dates, see Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons.\n\n![Shown in this image are Neptune and its moons: Triton, Galatea, Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Proteus, and Larissa](image)An annotated picture of Neptune's many moons as captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. The bright blue diffraction star is Triton, Neptune's largest moon.\nNeptune has 14 known moons.[7][139] Triton is the largest Neptunian moon, comprising more than 99.5% of the mass in orbit around Neptune,[h] and it is the only one massive enough to be spheroidal. Triton was discovered by William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place; it was probably once a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt.[140] It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation, and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration. It will eventually be torn apart, in about 3.6 billion years, when it reaches the Roche limit.[141] In 1989, Triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the Solar System,[142] with estimated temperatures of 38 K (−235 °C).[143]\n\n\nNeptune's second-known satellite (by order of discovery), the irregular moon Nereid, has one of the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the Solar System. The eccentricity of 0.7512 gives it an apoapsis that is seven times its periapsis distance from Neptune.[i]\n\n\nFrom July to September 1989, *Voyager 2* discovered six moons of Neptune.[144] Of these, the irregularly shaped Proteus is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity.[145] Although the second-most-massive Neptunian moon, it is only 0.25% the mass of Triton. Neptune's innermost four moons—Naiad, Thalassa, Despina and Galatea—orbit close enough to be within Neptune's rings. The next-farthest out, Larissa, was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star. This occultation had been attributed to ring arcs, but when *Voyager 2* observed Neptune in 1989, Larissa was found to have caused it. Five new irregular moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004.[146][147] A new moon and the smallest yet, Hippocamp, was found in 2013 by combining multiple Hubble images.[148] Because Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, Neptune's moons have been named after lesser sea gods.[51]\n\n\n\n### Planetary rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Neptune\n\n![](image)Neptune's rings and moons viewed in infrared by the James Webb Space Telescope\nNeptune has a planetary ring system, though one much less substantial than that of Saturn.[149] The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them a reddish hue.[150] The three main rings are the narrow Adams Ring, 63,000 km from the centre of Neptune, the Le Verrier Ring, at 53,000 km, and the broader, fainter Galle Ring, at 42,000 km. A faint outward extension to the Le Verrier Ring has been named Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57,000 km.[151]\n\n\nThe first of these planetary rings was detected in 1968 by a team led by Edward Guinan.[30][152] In the early 1980s, analysis of this data along with newer observations led to the hypothesis that this ring might be incomplete.[153]\nEvidence that the rings might have gaps first arose during a stellar occultation in 1984 when the rings obscured a star on immersion but not on emersion.[154] Images from *Voyager 2* in 1989 settled the issue by showing several faint rings.\n\n\nThe outermost ring, Adams, contains five prominent arcs now named *Courage*, *Liberté*, *Egalité 1*, *Egalité 2* and *Fraternité* (Courage, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity).[155] The existence of arcs was difficult to explain because the laws of motion would predict that arcs would spread out into a uniform ring over short timescales. Astronomers now estimate that the arcs are corralled into their current form by the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring.[156][157]\n\n\nEarth-based observations announced in 2005 appeared to show that Neptune's rings were much more unstable than previously thought. Images taken from the W. M. Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by *Voyager 2*. In particular, it seems that the *Liberté* arc might disappear in as little as one century.[158]\n\n\n\n\n## Observation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Movement of Neptune in front of the stars of Aquarius in 2022\n![Neptune visible in the night sky](image)In 2018, the European Southern Observatory used adaptive optics to get clear and high-resolution images of Neptune from the surface of Earth.\nNeptune brightened about 10% between 1980 and 2000 mostly due to the changing of the seasons.[159] Neptune may continue to brighten as it approaches perihelion in 2042. The apparent magnitude currently ranges from 7.67 to 7.89 with a mean of 7.78 and a standard deviation of 0.06.[15] Prior to 1980, the planet was as faint as magnitude 8.0.[15] Neptune is too faint to be visible to the naked eye. It can be outshone by Jupiter's Galilean moons, the dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroids 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, 7 Iris, 3 Juno, and 6 Hebe.[160] A telescope or strong binoculars will resolve Neptune as a small blue disk, similar in appearance to Uranus.[161]\n\n\nBecause of the distance of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4 arcseconds,[7][17] the smallest of the Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).[162][163][164] The first scientifically useful observation of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii.[165] Neptune is currently approaching perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) and has been shown to be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of it. Both *Hubble* and the adaptive-optics telescopes on Earth have made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet, among others. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.[166]\n\n\nFrom Earth, Neptune goes through apparent retrograde motion every 367 days, resulting in a looping motion against the background stars during each opposition. These loops carried it close to the 1846 discovery coordinates in April and July 2010 and again in October and November 2011.[122]\n\n\nNeptune's 164-year orbital period means that the planet takes an average of 13 years to move through each constellation of the zodiac. In 2011, it completed its first full orbit of the Sun since being discovered and returned to where it was first spotted northeast of Iota Aquarii.[41]\n\n\nObservation of Neptune in the radio-frequency band shows that it is a source of both continuous emission and irregular bursts. Both sources are thought to originate from its rotating magnetic field.[85] In the infrared part of the spectrum, Neptune's storms appear bright against the cooler background, allowing the size and shape of these features to be readily tracked.[167]\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Neptune\n\n![](image)A *Voyager 2* mosaic of Triton\n*Voyager 2* is the only spacecraft that has visited Neptune. The spacecraft's closest approach to the planet occurred on 25 August 1989. Because this was the last major planet the spacecraft could visit, it was decided to make a close flyby of the moon Triton, regardless of the consequences to the trajectory, similarly to what was done for *Voyager 1*'s encounter with Saturn and its moon Titan. The images relayed back to Earth from *Voyager 2* became the basis of a 1989 PBS all-night program, *Neptune All Night*.[168]\n\n\nDuring the encounter, signals from the spacecraft required 246 minutes to reach Earth. Hence, for the most part, *Voyager 2*'s mission relied on preloaded commands for the Neptune encounter. The spacecraft performed a near-encounter with the moon Nereid before it came within 4,400 km of Neptune's atmosphere on 25 August, then passed close to the planet's largest moon Triton later the same day.[169]\n\n\nThe spacecraft verified the existence of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre and tilted in a manner similar to the field around Uranus. Neptune's rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and *Voyager 2* also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to have more than one ring.[144][169]\n\n\nThe flyby also provided the first accurate measurement of Neptune's mass which was found to be 0.5 percent less than previously calculated. The new figure disproved the hypothesis that an undiscovered Planet X acted upon the orbits of Neptune and Uranus.[170][171]\n\n\nSince 2018, the China National Space Administration has been studying a concept for a pair of *Voyager*-like interstellar probes tentatively known as *Interstellar Express* or *Interstellar Heliosphere Probe*.[172] Both probes will be launched at the same time in 2024 and take differing paths to explore opposing ends of the heliosphere; the second probe, *IHP-2*, will fly by Neptune in January 2038, passing only 1,000 km above the cloud tops, and potentially carry an atmospheric impactor to be released during its approach.[173] Afterward, it will continue on its mission throughout the Kuiper belt toward the tail of the heliosphere, so far unexplored.\n\n\nAfter *Voyager 2* and *IHP-2*'s flybys, the next step in scientific exploration of the Neptunian system is considered to be an orbital mission; most proposals have been by NASA, most often for a Flagship orbiter.[174] Such a hypothetical mission is envisioned to be possible in the late 2020s or early 2030s.[174] However, there have been discussions to launch Neptune missions sooner. In 2003, there was a proposal in NASA's \"Vision Missions Studies\" for a \"Neptune Orbiter with Probes\" mission that does *Cassini*-level science.[175] A subsequent proposal was for *Argo*, a flyby spacecraft to be launched in 2019, that would visit Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and a Kuiper belt object. The focus would be on Neptune and its largest moon Triton to be investigated around 2029.[176] The proposed *New Horizons 2* mission (which was later scrapped) might also have done a close flyby of the Neptunian system. Currently a pending proposal for the Discovery program, *Trident* would conduct a flyby of Neptune and Triton;[177] however, the mission was not selected for Discovery 15 or 16. *Neptune Odyssey* is the current mission concept for a Neptune orbiter and atmospheric probe being studied as a possible large strategic science mission by NASA that would launch between 2031 and 2033, and arrive at Neptune by 2049.[178]\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Neptune\n* Hot Neptune\n* Neptune in astrology\n* Neptunium\n* *Neptune, the Mystic* – one of the seven movements in Gustav Holst's *Planets* suite\n* Timeline of the far future\n* Stats of planets in the Solar System\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Orbital elements refer to the Neptune barycentre and Solar System barycentre.

It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ![♆](image), representing Neptune's trident.[d]\n\n\nNeptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical predictions rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 14 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by *Voyager 2*, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; *Voyager 2* remains the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune.[18][19] The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.\n\n\nLike the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but contains a higher proportion of *ices* such as water, ammonia and methane. Similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock;[20] both planets are normally considered \"ice giants\" to distinguish them.[21] Along with Rayleigh scattering, traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance.[22] The blue colour is more saturated than the one present on Uranus due to the thinner haze of Neptune's more active atmosphere.[23][24][25]\n\n\nIn contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the *Voyager 2* flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. In 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[26] These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 km/h (580 m/s; 1,300 mph).[27] Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (−218 °C; −361 °F). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C; 9,300 °F).[28][29] Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled \"arcs\"), which was discovered in 1984, then later confirmed by *Voyager 2*.[30]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Discovery of Neptune\n\n![](image)Galileo Galilei\nSome of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo Galilei's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613 contain plotted points that match with what is now known to have been the positions of Neptune on those dates. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky.[31] Hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.[32] In 2009, a study suggested that Galileo was at least aware that the \"star\" he had observed had moved relative to fixed stars.[33]\n\n\nIn 1821, Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of Neptune's neighbour Uranus.[34] Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction.[35] In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had. He requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844. Adams continued to work in 1845–1846 and produced several different estimates of a new planet.[36][37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Urbain Le Verrier\nIn 1845–1846, Urbain Le Verrier, independently of Adams, developed his own calculations but aroused no enthusiasm in his compatriots. In June 1846, upon seeing Le Verrier's first published estimate of the planet's longitude and its similarity to Adams's estimate, Airy persuaded James Challis to search for the planet. Challis vainly scoured the sky throughout August and September.[35][38] Challis had, in fact, observed Neptune a year before the planet's subsequent discoverer, Johann Gottfried Galle, and on two occasions, 4 and 12 August 1845. However, his out-of-date star maps and poor observing techniques meant that he failed to recognise the observations as such until he carried out later analysis. Challis was full of remorse but blamed his neglect on his maps and the fact that he was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.[39][35][40]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Le Verrier sent a letter and urged Berlin Observatory astronomer Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, a student at the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune just northeast of Iota Aquarii, 1° from the \"*five degrees east of Delta Capricorn*\" position Le Verrier had predicted it to be,[41][42] about 12° from Adams's prediction, and on the border of Aquarius and Capricornus according to the modern IAU constellation boundaries.\n\n\nIn the wake of the discovery, there was a heated nationalistic rivalry between the French and the British over who deserved credit for the discovery. Eventually, an international consensus emerged that Le Verrier and Adams deserved joint credit. Since 1966, Dennis Rawlins has questioned the credibility of Adams's claim to co-discovery, and the issue was re-evaluated by historians with the return in 1998 of the \"Neptune papers\" (historical documents) to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.[43][44]\n\n\n\n### Naming[edit]\n\n\nShortly after its discovery, Neptune was referred to simply as \"the planet exterior to Uranus\" or as \"Le Verrier's planet\". The first suggestion for a name came from Galle, who proposed the name *Janus*. In England, Challis put forward the name *Oceanus*.[45]\n\n\nClaiming the right to name his discovery, Le Verrier quickly proposed the name *Neptune* for this new planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes.[46] In October, he sought to name the planet *Le Verrier*, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, François Arago. This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France.[47] French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name *Herschel* for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and *Leverrier* for the new planet.[48]\n\n\nStruve came out in favour of the name *Neptune* on 29 December 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences,[49] after the colour of the planet as viewed through a telescope.[50] Soon, *Neptune* became the internationally accepted name. In Roman mythology, Neptune was the god of the sea, identified with the Greek Poseidon. The demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets, all of which were named for deities in Greek and Roman mythology.[e][51]\n\n\nMost languages today use some variant of the name \"Neptune\" for the planet; indeed, in Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean, the planet's name was translated as \"sea king star\" (海王星).[52][53] In Mongolian, Neptune is called *Dalain van* (Далайн ван), reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the sea. In modern Greek the planet is called *Poseidon* (Ποσειδώνας, *Poseidonas*), the Greek counterpart of Neptune.[54] In Hebrew, *Rahab* (רהב), from a Biblical sea monster mentioned in the Book of Psalms, was selected in a vote managed by the Academy of the Hebrew Language in 2009 as the official name for the planet, even though the existing Latin term *Neptun* (נפטון) is commonly used.[55][56] In Māori, the planet is called *Tangaroa*, named after the Māori god of the sea.[57] In Nahuatl, the planet is called *Tlāloccītlalli*, named after the rain god Tlāloc.[57] In Thai, Neptune is referred to by its Westernised name *Dao Nepchun/Nepjun* (ดาวเนปจูน), but is also called *Dao Ket* (ดาวเกตุ, lit. 'star of Ketu'), after Ketu (केतु), the descending lunar node, who plays a role in Hindu astrology. In Malay, the name *Waruna*, after the Hindu god of seas, is attested as far back as the 1970s,[58] but was eventually superseded by the Latinate equivalents *Neptun* (in Malaysian[59]) or *Neptunus* (in Indonesian[60]).\n\n\nThe usual adjectival form is *Neptunian*. The nonce form *Poseidean* (/pəˈsaɪdiən/), from Poseidon, has also been used,[4] though the usual adjectival form of Poseidon is *Poseidonian* (/ˌpɒsaɪˈdoʊniən/).[61]\n\n\n\n### Status[edit]\n\n\nFrom its discovery in 1846 until the discovery of Pluto in 1930, Neptune was the farthest known planet. When Pluto was discovered, it was considered a planet, and Neptune thus became the second-farthest known planet, except for a 20-year period between 1979 and 1999 when Pluto's elliptical orbit brought it closer than Neptune to the Sun, making Neptune the ninth planet from the Sun during this period.[62][63] The increasingly accurate estimations of Pluto's mass from ten times that of Earth's to far less than that of the Moon[64] and the discovery of the Kuiper belt in 1992 led many astronomers to debate whether Pluto should be considered a planet or as part of the Kuiper belt.[65][66] In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined the word \"planet\" for the first time, reclassifying Pluto as a \"dwarf planet\" and making Neptune once again the outermost-known planet in the Solar System.[67]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A size comparison of Neptune and Earth\nNeptune's mass of 1.0243×1026 kg[7] is intermediate between Earth and the larger gas giants: it is 17 times that of Earth but just 1/19th that of Jupiter.[f] Its gravity at 1 bar is 11.15 m/s2, 1.14 times the surface gravity of Earth,[68] and surpassed only by Jupiter.[69] Neptune's equatorial radius of 24,764 km[10] is nearly four times that of Earth. Neptune, like Uranus, is an ice giant, a subclass of giant planet, because they are smaller and have higher concentrations of volatiles than Jupiter and Saturn.[70] In the search for exoplanets, Neptune has been used as a metonym: discovered bodies of similar mass are often referred to as \"Neptunes\",[71] just as scientists refer to various extrasolar bodies as \"Jupiters\".\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Extraterrestrial diamonds\n\nNeptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5 to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10 to 20% of the way towards the core. Pressure in the atmosphere reaches about 10 GPa, or about 100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere. Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Physical and chemical composition of Neptune's interior\nThe mantle is equivalent to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water, ammonia and methane.[1] As is customary in planetary science, this mixture is referred to as icy even though it is a hot, dense fluid (supercritical fluid). This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean.[72] The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice.[73] At a depth of 7,000 km, the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones.[74][75][76] Scientists also believe that this kind of diamond rain occurs on Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.[77][75] Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the top of the mantle may be an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds'.[78][79][80]\n\n\nThe core of Neptune is likely composed of iron, nickel and silicates, with an interior model giving a mass about 1.2 times that of Earth.[81] The pressure at the centre is 7 Mbar (700 GPa), about twice as high as that at the centre of Earth, and the temperature may be 5,400 K.[28][29]\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Combined colour and near-infrared image of Neptune, showing bands of methane in its atmosphere, and four of its moons, Proteus, Larissa, Galatea, and Despina\nA time-lapse video of Neptune and its moons\nAt high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium.[28] A trace amount of methane is also present. Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue,[82] although Neptune's blue differs from Uranus's milder light blue due to concentrated haze in the latter atmosphere.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Neptune - cloud cover over three decades (1994-2023)[84]\nNeptune's atmosphere is subdivided into two main regions: the lower troposphere, where temperature decreases with altitude, and the stratosphere, where temperature increases with altitude. The boundary between the two, the tropopause, lies at a pressure of 0.1 bars (10 kPa).[21] The stratosphere then gives way to the thermosphere at a pressure lower than 10−5 to 10−4 bars (1 to 10 Pa).[21] The thermosphere gradually transitions to the exosphere.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bands of high-altitude clouds cast shadows on Neptune's lower cloud deck.\nModels suggest that Neptune's troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on altitude.[84] The upper-level clouds lie at pressures below one bar, where the temperature is suitable for methane to condense. For pressures between one and five bars (100 and 500 kPa), clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are thought to form. Above a pressure of five bars, the clouds may consist of ammonia, ammonium sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and water. Deeper clouds of water ice should be found at pressures of about 50 bars (5.0 MPa), where the temperature reaches 273 K (0 °C). Underneath, clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be found.[85]\n\n\nHigh-altitude clouds on Neptune have been observed casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitudes. These circumferential bands have widths of 50–150 km and lie about 50–110 km above the cloud deck.[86] These altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere. Weather does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere. In August 2023, the clouds of Neptune vanished, possibly due to \"solar flare\".[84] Thirty years of observations by Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes showed that Neptune's cloud activity is bound to Solar cycles, and not to the planet's seasons.[87][88]\n\n\nNeptune's spectra suggest that its lower stratosphere is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane, such as ethane and ethyne.[21][28] The stratosphere is also home to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide.[21][89] The stratosphere of Neptune is warmer than that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.[21]\n\n\nFor reasons that remain obscure, the planet's thermosphere is at an anomalously high temperature of about 750 K.[90][91] The planet is too far from the Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.[85][89]\n\n\n\n### Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\nNeptune resembles Uranus in its magnetosphere, with a magnetic field strongly tilted relative to its rotational axis at 47° and offset at least 0.55 radius, or about 13,500 km from the planet's physical centre. Before *Voyager 2*'s arrival at Neptune, it was hypothesised that Uranus's tilted magnetosphere was the result of its sideways rotation. In comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets, scientists now think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in the planets' interiors. This field may be generated by convective fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of electrically conducting liquids (probably a combination of ammonia, methane and water)[85] resulting in a dynamo action.[92]\n\n\nThe dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14 microteslas (0.14 G).[93] The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2 × 1017 T·m3 (14 μT·*R**N*3, where *R**N* is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune may be the result of an offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.[94][95]\n\n\nMeasurements by *Voyager 2* in extreme-ultraviolet and radio frequencies revealed that Neptune has faint and weak but complex and unique aurorae; however, these observations were limited in time and did not contain infrared. Subsequent astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have not glimpsed the aurorae, in contrast to the more well-defined aurorae of Uranus.[96][97]\n\n\nNeptune's bow shock, where the magnetosphere begins to slow the solar wind, occurs at a distance of 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The magnetopause, where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind, lies at a distance of 23–26.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and likely much farther.[94]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Great Dark Spot (top), Scooter (middle white cloud),[98] and the Small Dark Spot (bottom), with contrast exaggerated.\nNeptune's weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm systems, with winds reaching speeds of almost 600 m/s (2,200 km/h; 1,300 mph)—exceeding supersonic flow.[27] More typically, by tracking the motion of persistent clouds, wind speeds have been shown to vary from 20 m/s in the easterly direction to 325 m/s westward.[99] At the cloud tops, the prevailing winds range in speed from 400 m/s along the equator to 250 m/s at the poles.[85] Most of the winds on Neptune move in a direction opposite the planet's rotation.[100] The general pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs. retrograde rotation at lower latitudes. The difference in flow direction is thought to be a \"skin effect\" and not due to any deeper atmospheric processes.[21] At 70° S latitude, a high-speed jet travels at a speed of 300 m/s.[21]\n\n\nNeptune differs from Uranus in its typical level of meteorological activity. *Voyager 2* observed weather phenomena on Neptune during its 1989 flyby,[101] but no comparable phenomena on Uranus during its 1986 fly-by.\n\n\nThe abundance of methane, ethane and acetylene at Neptune's equator is 10–100 times greater than at the poles. This is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at the equator and subsidence near the poles because photochemistry cannot account for the distribution without meridional circulation.[21]\n\n\nIn 2007, it was discovered that the upper troposphere of Neptune's south pole was about 10 K warmer than the rest of its atmosphere, which averages approximately 73 K (−200 °C). The temperature differential is enough to let methane, which elsewhere is frozen in the troposphere, escape into the stratosphere near the pole.[102] The relative \"hot spot\" is due to Neptune's axial tilt, which has exposed the south pole to the Sun for the last quarter of Neptune's year, or roughly 40 Earth years. As Neptune slowly moves towards the opposite side of the Sun, the south pole will be darkened and the north pole illuminated, causing the methane release to shift to the north pole.[103]\n\n\nBecause of seasonal changes, the cloud bands in the southern hemisphere of Neptune have been observed to increase in size and albedo. This trend was first seen in 1980. The long orbital period of Neptune results in seasons lasting forty years.[104]\n\n\n\n### Storms[edit]\n\n\nIn 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anticyclonic storm system spanning 13,000 km × 6,600 km (8,100 mi × 4,100 mi)[101] was discovered by NASA's *Voyager 2* spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.[105]\n\n\nThe Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. This nickname first arose during the months leading up to the *Voyager 2* encounter in 1989, when they were observed moving at speeds faster than the Great Dark Spot (and images acquired later would subsequently reveal the presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by *Voyager 2*).[100] The Small Dark Spot is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It was initially completely dark, but as *Voyager 2* approached the planet, a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.[106] In 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[26] In 2023, the first ground-based observation of a dark spot on Neptune was announced.[107]\n\n\nNeptune's dark spots are thought to occur in the troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features,[108] so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures.[86] Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer.[109] The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other, unknown mechanism.[110]\n\n\n\n* ![The appearance of a Northern Great Dark Spot in 2018 is evidence of a huge storm brewing.[111]](image)\n\nThe appearance of a Northern Great Dark Spot in 2018 is evidence of a huge storm brewing.[111]\n* ![The Northern Great Dark Spot and a smaller companion storm imaged by Hubble in 2020[112]](image)\n\nThe Northern Great Dark Spot and a smaller companion storm imaged by Hubble in 2020[112]\n* ![The Great Dark Spot, as imaged by Voyager 2](image)\n\nThe Great Dark Spot in a color-uncalibrated image by *Voyager 2.*\n* ![Neptune's shrinking vortex[113]](image)\n\nNeptune's shrinking vortex[113]\n\n\n### Internal heating[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Four images taken a few hours apart with the NASA/ESA *Hubble Space Telescope*'s Wide Field Camera 3. Near infrared radiation data has been used as red channel.[114]\nNeptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C).[115] Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun;[116] whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun.[117] Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, and lies over 50% farther from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% of its amount of sunlight,[21] yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.[118]\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Neptune (red arc) completes one orbit around the Sun (centre) for every 164.79 orbits of Earth. The light blue object represents Uranus.\nThe average distance between Neptune and the Sun is 4.5 billion km (about 30.1 astronomical units (AU)), and it completes an orbit on average every 164.79 years, subject to a variability of around ±0.1 years. The perihelion distance is 29.81 AU; the aphelion distance is 30.33 AU.[g]\n\n\nOn 11 July 2011, Neptune completed its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846,[120] although it did not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky, because Earth was in a different location in its 365.26 day orbit. Because of the motion of the Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 July 2011.[11][121][122]\n\n\nThe elliptical orbit of Neptune is inclined 1.77° compared to that of Earth.\n\n\nThe axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32°,[123] which is similar to the tilts of Earth (23°) and Mars (25°). As a result, Neptune experiences similar seasonal changes to Earth. The long orbital period of Neptune means that the seasons last for forty Earth years.[104] Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11 hours.[11] Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme.\n\n\nBecause Neptune is not a solid body, its atmosphere undergoes differential rotation. The wide equatorial zone rotates with a period of about 18 hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12 hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System,[124] and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.[86]\n\n\n\n\n### Orbital resonances[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Kuiper belt, resonant trans-Neptunian object, and Neptune trojan\n\n![](image)A diagram showing the major orbital resonances in the Kuiper belt caused by Neptune: the highlighted regions are the 2:3 resonance (plutinos), the nonresonant \"classical belt\" (cubewanos), and the 1:2 resonance (twotinos).\nNeptune's orbit has a profound impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30 AU out to about 55 AU from the Sun.[125] Much in the same way that Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in its structure. The region between 40 and 42 AU is an example.[126]\n\n\nThere do exist orbits within these empty regions where objects can survive for the age of the Solar System. These resonances occur when Neptune's orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the object, such as 1:2, or 3:4. If, say, an object orbits the Sun once for every two Neptune orbits, it will only complete half an orbit by the time Neptune returns to its original position. The most heavily populated resonance in the Kuiper belt, with over 200 known objects,[127] is the 2:3 resonance. Objects in this resonance complete 2 orbits for every 3 of Neptune, and are known as plutinos because the largest of the known Kuiper belt objects, Pluto, is among them.[128] Although Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit regularly, the 2:3 resonance ensures they can never collide.[129] The 3:4, 3:5, 4:7 and 2:5 resonances are less populated.[130]\n\n\nNeptune has a number of known trojan objects occupying both the Sun–Neptune L4 and L5 Lagrangian points—gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing Neptune in its orbit, respectively.[131] Neptune trojans can be viewed as being in a 1:1 resonance with Neptune. Some Neptune trojans are remarkably stable in their orbits, and are likely to have formed alongside Neptune rather than being captured. The first object identified as associated with Neptune's trailing L5 Lagrangian point was 2008 LC18.[132] Neptune also has a temporary quasi-satellite, (309239) 2007 RW10.[133] The object has been a quasi-satellite of Neptune for about 12,500 years and it will remain in that dynamical state for another 12,500 years.[133]\n\n\n\n## Formation and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Formation and evolution of the Solar System and Nice model\n\n![](image)A simulation showing the outer planets and Kuiper belt: a) before Jupiter and Saturn reached a 2:1 resonance; b) after inward scattering of Kuiper belt objects following the orbital shift of Neptune; c) after ejection of scattered Kuiper belt bodies by Jupiter\nThe formation of the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, has proven difficult to model precisely. Current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the Solar System was too low to account for the formation of such large bodies from the traditionally accepted method of core accretion, and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their formation. One is that the ice giants were not formed by core accretion but from instabilities within the original protoplanetary disc and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive OB star.[70]\n\n\nAn alternative concept is that they formed closer to the Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after the removal of the gaseous protoplanetary disc.[134] This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region.[135] The current most widely accepted[136][137][138] explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.\n\n\n\n## Moons and rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Neptune\n\nFor a timeline of discovery dates, see Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons.\n\n![Shown in this image are Neptune and its moons: Triton, Galatea, Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Proteus, and Larissa](image)An annotated picture of Neptune's many moons as captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. The bright blue diffraction star is Triton, Neptune's largest moon.\nNeptune has 14 known moons.[7][139] Triton is the largest Neptunian moon, comprising more than 99.5% of the mass in orbit around Neptune,[h] and it is the only one massive enough to be spheroidal. Triton was discovered by William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place; it was probably once a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt.[140] It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation, and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration. It will eventually be torn apart, in about 3.6 billion years, when it reaches the Roche limit.[141] In 1989, Triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the Solar System,[142] with estimated temperatures of 38 K (−235 °C).[143]\n\n\nNeptune's second-known satellite (by order of discovery), the irregular moon Nereid, has one of the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the Solar System. The eccentricity of 0.7512 gives it an apoapsis that is seven times its periapsis distance from Neptune.[i]\n\n\nFrom July to September 1989, *Voyager 2* discovered six moons of Neptune.[144] Of these, the irregularly shaped Proteus is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity.[145] Although the second-most-massive Neptunian moon, it is only 0.25% the mass of Triton. Neptune's innermost four moons—Naiad, Thalassa, Despina and Galatea—orbit close enough to be within Neptune's rings. The next-farthest out, Larissa, was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star. This occultation had been attributed to ring arcs, but when *Voyager 2* observed Neptune in 1989, Larissa was found to have caused it. Five new irregular moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004.[146][147] A new moon and the smallest yet, Hippocamp, was found in 2013 by combining multiple Hubble images.[148] Because Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, Neptune's moons have been named after lesser sea gods.[51]\n\n\n\n### Planetary rings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rings of Neptune\n\n![](image)Neptune's rings and moons viewed in infrared by the James Webb Space Telescope\nNeptune has a planetary ring system, though one much less substantial than that of Saturn.[149] The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them a reddish hue.[150] The three main rings are the narrow Adams Ring, 63,000 km from the centre of Neptune, the Le Verrier Ring, at 53,000 km, and the broader, fainter Galle Ring, at 42,000 km. A faint outward extension to the Le Verrier Ring has been named Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57,000 km.[151]\n\n\nThe first of these planetary rings was detected in 1968 by a team led by Edward Guinan.[30][152] In the early 1980s, analysis of this data along with newer observations led to the hypothesis that this ring might be incomplete.[153]\nEvidence that the rings might have gaps first arose during a stellar occultation in 1984 when the rings obscured a star on immersion but not on emersion.[154] Images from *Voyager 2* in 1989 settled the issue by showing several faint rings.\n\n\nThe outermost ring, Adams, contains five prominent arcs now named *Courage*, *Liberté*, *Egalité 1*, *Egalité 2* and *Fraternité* (Courage, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity).[155] The existence of arcs was difficult to explain because the laws of motion would predict that arcs would spread out into a uniform ring over short timescales. Astronomers now estimate that the arcs are corralled into their current form by the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring.[156][157]\n\n\nEarth-based observations announced in 2005 appeared to show that Neptune's rings were much more unstable than previously thought. Images taken from the W. M. Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by *Voyager 2*. In particular, it seems that the *Liberté* arc might disappear in as little as one century.[158]\n\n\n\n\n## Observation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Movement of Neptune in front of the stars of Aquarius in 2022\n![Neptune visible in the night sky](image)In 2018, the European Southern Observatory used adaptive optics to get clear and high-resolution images of Neptune from the surface of Earth.\nNeptune brightened about 10% between 1980 and 2000 mostly due to the changing of the seasons.[159] Neptune may continue to brighten as it approaches perihelion in 2042. The apparent magnitude currently ranges from 7.67 to 7.89 with a mean of 7.78 and a standard deviation of 0.06.[15] Prior to 1980, the planet was as faint as magnitude 8.0.[15] Neptune is too faint to be visible to the naked eye. It can be outshone by Jupiter's Galilean moons, the dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroids 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, 7 Iris, 3 Juno, and 6 Hebe.[160] A telescope or strong binoculars will resolve Neptune as a small blue disk, similar in appearance to Uranus.[161]\n\n\nBecause of the distance of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4 arcseconds,[7][17] the smallest of the Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).[162][163][164] The first scientifically useful observation of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii.[165] Neptune is currently approaching perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) and has been shown to be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of it. Both *Hubble* and the adaptive-optics telescopes on Earth have made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet, among others. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.[166]\n\n\nFrom Earth, Neptune goes through apparent retrograde motion every 367 days, resulting in a looping motion against the background stars during each opposition. These loops carried it close to the 1846 discovery coordinates in April and July 2010 and again in October and November 2011.[122]\n\n\nNeptune's 164-year orbital period means that the planet takes an average of 13 years to move through each constellation of the zodiac. In 2011, it completed its first full orbit of the Sun since being discovered and returned to where it was first spotted northeast of Iota Aquarii.[41]\n\n\nObservation of Neptune in the radio-frequency band shows that it is a source of both continuous emission and irregular bursts. Both sources are thought to originate from its rotating magnetic field.[85] In the infrared part of the spectrum, Neptune's storms appear bright against the cooler background, allowing the size and shape of these features to be readily tracked.[167]\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of Neptune\n\n![](image)A *Voyager 2* mosaic of Triton\n*Voyager 2* is the only spacecraft that has visited Neptune. The spacecraft's closest approach to the planet occurred on 25 August 1989. Because this was the last major planet the spacecraft could visit, it was decided to make a close flyby of the moon Triton, regardless of the consequences to the trajectory, similarly to what was done for *Voyager 1*'s encounter with Saturn and its moon Titan. The images relayed back to Earth from *Voyager 2* became the basis of a 1989 PBS all-night program, *Neptune All Night*.[168]\n\n\nDuring the encounter, signals from the spacecraft required 246 minutes to reach Earth. Hence, for the most part, *Voyager 2*'s mission relied on preloaded commands for the Neptune encounter. The spacecraft performed a near-encounter with the moon Nereid before it came within 4,400 km of Neptune's atmosphere on 25 August, then passed close to the planet's largest moon Triton later the same day.[169]\n\n\nThe spacecraft verified the existence of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre and tilted in a manner similar to the field around Uranus. Neptune's rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and *Voyager 2* also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to have more than one ring.[144][169]\n\n\nThe flyby also provided the first accurate measurement of Neptune's mass which was found to be 0.5 percent less than previously calculated. The new figure disproved the hypothesis that an undiscovered Planet X acted upon the orbits of Neptune and Uranus.[170][171]\n\n\nSince 2018, the China National Space Administration has been studying a concept for a pair of *Voyager*-like interstellar probes tentatively known as *Interstellar Express* or *Interstellar Heliosphere Probe*.[172] Both probes will be launched at the same time in 2024 and take differing paths to explore opposing ends of the heliosphere; the second probe, *IHP-2*, will fly by Neptune in January 2038, passing only 1,000 km above the cloud tops, and potentially carry an atmospheric impactor to be released during its approach.[173] Afterward, it will continue on its mission throughout the Kuiper belt toward the tail of the heliosphere, so far unexplored.\n\n\nAfter *Voyager 2* and *IHP-2*'s flybys, the next step in scientific exploration of the Neptunian system is considered to be an orbital mission; most proposals have been by NASA, most often for a Flagship orbiter.[174] Such a hypothetical mission is envisioned to be possible in the late 2020s or early 2030s.[174] However, there have been discussions to launch Neptune missions sooner. In 2003, there was a proposal in NASA's \"Vision Missions Studies\" for a \"Neptune Orbiter with Probes\" mission that does *Cassini*-level science.[175] A subsequent proposal was for *Argo*, a flyby spacecraft to be launched in 2019, that would visit Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and a Kuiper belt object. The focus would be on Neptune and its largest moon Triton to be investigated around 2029.[176] The proposed *New Horizons 2* mission (which was later scrapped) might also have done a close flyby of the Neptunian system. Currently a pending proposal for the Discovery program, *Trident* would conduct a flyby of Neptune and Triton;[177] however, the mission was not selected for Discovery 15 or 16. *Neptune Odyssey* is the current mission concept for a Neptune orbiter and atmospheric probe being studied as a possible large strategic science mission by NASA that would launch between 2031 and 2033, and arrive at Neptune by 2049.[178]\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Neptune\n* Hot Neptune\n* Neptune in astrology\n* Neptunium\n* *Neptune, the Mystic* – one of the seven movements in Gustav Holst's *Planets* suite\n* Timeline of the far future\n* Stats of planets in the Solar System\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Orbital elements refer to the Neptune barycentre and Solar System barycentre.
