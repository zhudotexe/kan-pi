It is modeled after the WNBA Commissioner's Cup and in-season multi-stage competitions held in European soccer. The tournament is structured as follows:[36][37][38]\n\n\n\n* Six intraconference pools of five.\n* Tuesdays and Fridays during November will feature group games against each of the other teams in their pool (two at home and two on the road). These games will still count as regular season games.\n* The winners of each pool and two wild-card teams will advance to a single-elimination tournament.\n* The semifinals and championship game will be played in Las Vegas.\n* Players for the tournament champion will each receive $500,000.\n* To compensate, the NBA's regular season scheduling formula will be modified so only 80 games for each team are initially announced during the offseason. The first two rounds of the in-season tournament would then count as regular season games 81 and 82. The championship game would then be an extra 83rd game that would not count toward the regular season. Teams that do not qualify for the in-season tournament, or are eliminated in the quarterfinals, would then be scheduled additional games against each other that are eliminated in the same conference (if possible) and round to reach 82 games.\n\n\nThe schedule for the in-season tournament was released on August 15, 2023.[33] The additional conclusion games for those teams that do not qualify for the in-season tournament, or are eliminated in the quarterfinals, will be announced at a later date.\n\n\n\n### Standings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Arenas[edit]\n\n\n* This is the Los Angeles Clippers' final season at Crypto.com Arena, as the team is scheduled move to the new Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, beginning with the 2024–25 season.[42]\n* The Utah Jazz's home arena, known for several years as Vivint Arena, reverted back to its original Delta Center name on July 1, 2023 as the team came to a new naming rights agreement with Delta Airlines.[43]\n* The San Antonio Spurs' home arena, formerly known as AT&T Center, was renamed Frost Bank Center on August 3, 2023.[44][45]\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### National[edit]\n\n\n#### Linear television[edit]\n\n\nThis is the eighth year of a nine-year deal with ABC, ESPN, TNT, and NBA TV.[46] ESPN has Wednesday and Friday night games during most of the regular season, along with selected Sunday games from February to April, and a Monday night doubleheader on March 18.[47] TNT has Tuesday games, and Thursday games during opening week and again from January to April.[48] NBA TV televises games primarily on Mondays all season, Saturday and Sunday nights for most of the season, Thursdays during the first half of the season, Fridays during the second half of the season, and any other time when the other national broadcasters are not airing games.[49] ABC's schedule includes *NBA Saturday Primetime* games on selected Saturdays between December and March (including a tripleheader on January 27), and *NBA Sunday Showcase* games on four selected Sunday afternoons in February and March.[47] On October 2, 2023, it was announced that five January games originally scheduled as part of ESPN's Wednesday doubleheaders would instead air on ABC.[50]\n\n\nFor the NBA in-season tournament, TNT and ESPN will air selected group stage games as part of their regular Tuesday and Friday coverage, respectively. NBA TV will also have two on Friday, November 24.[51] During the knockout stage, TNT will air all four quarterfinals on December 4 and 5. For the semifinals on December 7, ESPN will televise the early game and TNT will have the late game. The championship game on Saturday, December 9 will be on ABC as part of a special *NBA Saturday Primetime*.[52] During these weeks, ESPN and NBA TV will continue to air other regular season games on Wednesdays and other days, including ESPN's coverage of consolation games on December 6 and December 8.[47][53]\n\n\nFive Christmas Day games are scheduled for this season. With Christmas Day falling on a Monday in 2023, the NFL also scheduled a *Monday Night Football* on that day. Because ABC/ESPN holds the broadcast rights to both NBA Christmas games and *Monday Night Football*, it was decided that ESPN will again air all five NBA games, but ABC will only simulcast two of them in favor of exclusively airing the *Monday Night Football* game. This would mark the first time since 2016 that ABC will televise fewer than three NBA Christmas games.[47]\n\n\nFour Martin Luther King Jr. Day games will be televised nationally, with TNT and NBA TV airing two apiece.[2][48][49]\n\n\nOn January 23–27, the league will hold \"NBA Rivals Week\" for the second consecutive season, with every nationally televised game featuring \"classic and budding rivalries between teams and players\".[2]\n\n\nOn the final day of the regular season, Sunday, April 14, two games with playoff implications will be flexed into ESPN's afternoon doubleheader.[2][47]\n\n\n\n#### Streaming[edit]\n\n\nThis is the first regular season that the streaming service Max will have live access to TNT's games on its Bleacher Report Sports Add-on tier.[54]\n\n\nNBA League Pass will continue to offer out-of-market games, live access to NBA TV, and on-demand replays of every game.\n\n\n\n### Local[edit]\n\n\nThe Washington Wizards' broadcaster became Monumental Sports Network prior to the start of the season. In September 2022, Ted Leonsis's Monumental Sports & Entertainment bought out NBCUniversal's ownership stake in what was then its Regional Network brand, NBC Sports Washington.[55][56]\n\n\n\n#### Diamond Sports Group bankruptcy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Diamond Sports Group § Bankruptcy\n\nThe 16 NBA teams who had deals with the Bally Sports regional sports networks may be affected by its operator Diamond Sports Group's March 14, 2023, decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Diamond had initially sought to continue broadcasting regional games while it plans to separate from majority parent Sinclair Broadcast Group as part of the reorganization.[57]\n\n\nOn April 20, 2023, the Phoenix Suns signed a five-year agreement with Gray Television to replace Bally Sports Arizona as their broadcaster. Most Suns games would then be carried on broadcast television by Gray's KTVK, KPHO-TV, or KPHE-LD in Phoenix (as well as Tucson sister station KOLD-DT5, a new Gray station in Flagstaff, KAZF, and a new Gray station in Yuma, KAZS, with the latter two launching before the season starts). The Suns will also operate an over-the-top subscription service called \"Suns Live\", which is created by Kiswe.[58][59][60] After the announcement, Diamond accused the team of breaching its contract and bankruptcy law, stating that the team was making an \"improper effort\" to \"change their broadcasting partner without permitting Diamond to exercise our contractual rights.\" In response, Phoenix Suns CEO Josh Bartelstein stated that \"Diamond's position is totally inaccurate. We are moving forward with this deal and could not be more excited about what it means for our fans and our future.\"[58][59][61] On May 10, 2023, the bankruptcy judge voided the Suns contract with Gray, ruling that the Suns violated Bally Sports Arizona's contractual right of first refusal. He ordered the parties into arbitration.[62] On July 14, 2023, the deal became official when Diamond declined to match Gray's contract offer, going forward with the intended plan of theirs, only removing CBS 5 from the initial list that included 3TV and Arizona's Family Sports.[63] With Bally Sports later losing airing rights to the Arizona Diamondbacks to the MLB itself and the NHL's Arizona Coyotes to Scripps Sports, Bally Sports Arizona ended up shutting down services on October 21, 2023.\n\n\nOn October 1, 2023, Diamond Sports missed a payment to the Orlando Magic. However, on November 6, 2023, Diamond Sports and the NBA reached a one-year agreement that will result in the contracts for teams airing on Diamond expiring after the 2023–24 NBA season, but will result in the Magic being paid in the process. Across the board, all NBA teams airing on Diamond Sports will receive a 16% reduction in the money they receive, but teams will now be able to sell 10 games of their choosing to local over-the-air networks. However, the deal still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court first.[64][65]\n\n\n\n#### AT&T SportsNet closure[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was winding down its AT&T SportsNet regional sports network business, affecting the Houston Rockets and the Utah Jazz's broadcasters, AT&T SportsNet Southwest and AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain, respectively. The Portland Trail Blazers' deal with Root Sports Northwest is not affected because Warner Bros. Discovery only has minority control of that network.[66][67]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Jazz reached an agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group owned stations KJZZ-TV and KUTV to become its new television home. Jazz owner Ryan Smith will start a new in-house production division, SEG Media, to produce the telecasts. While all games will air on KJZZ, Sinclair retains the right to carry select telecasts on KUTV, and KUTV will maintain an \"official station\" relationship with the team, allowing more coverage of the Jazz and its players. The deal will also include a streaming service, which will not involve KJZZ-TV.[68] AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain later rebranded itself to just SportsNet Rocky Mountain before shutting down services on October 21, 2023.\n\n\nThe Houston Rockets and the MLB's Houston Astros took over ownership of AT&T SportsNet Southwest, rebranding it as Space City Home Network on October 3, 2023.[69]\n\n\n\n### Personnel[edit]\n\n\nAs part of a wave of layoffs, ESPN released analysts Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy, and replaced them with Doris Burke and Doc Rivers on the lead announce team with Mike Breen.[70]\n\n\nBoston Celtics television announcer Mike Gorman announced his retirement effective after this season.[71] For this season, Gorman is only calling home games, with Drew Carter taking over for preseason and road games. Carter was also announced as Gorman's successor effective next season.[72]\n\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets added Noah Eagle, son of primary television announcer Ian Eagle, to the broadcast team calling select games. The younger Eagle is expected to call around 10 games in lieu of Ian and secondary announcer Ryan Ruocco.[73]\n\n\n\n## Notable occurrences[edit]\n\n\n* On July 25, 2023, Jaylen Brown signed a five-year, $304 million contract extension with the Boston Celtics, the largest and richest in league history.[74]\n* On October 25, 2023, Victor Wembanyama scored three 3-pointers in his regular season debut, the most by a Spurs rookie in a single game.[75]\n* On October 31, 2023, Kevin Durant passed Hakeem Olajuwon for 12th on the league's all-time scoring list.[76]\n* On November 1, 2023, LeBron James scored 35 points in the Los Angeles Lakers' 130–125 overtime victory against the Los Angeles Clippers. His performance marked his 81st 30-point game since turning 35 years old in December 2019, surpassing Karl Malone for the most 30-point games by any player since turning 35 in NBA history.[77]\n* On November 1, 2023, Stephen Curry became the first player in NBA history to score at least one three-pointer in 250 consecutive regular season games.[78]\n* On November 6, 2023, Nikola Jokić passed LeBron James and Jason Kidd for the 4th place on the NBA all-time triple-double list.[79]\n* For the second consecutive season, the league did not schedule regular season games on Election Day in the United States, which fell on November 7.[2]\n* On November 14, 2023, an altercation occurred during a game between the Golden State Warriors and the Minnesota Timberwolves.[80] As a result of the incident, Draymond Green was suspended for five games.[81] Green was also fined for the same reason, alongside Klay Thompson, Rudy Gobert, and Jaden McDaniels.[82][83]\n* On November 15, 2023, LeBron James passed Jason Kidd for 5th on the all-time triple-doubles list.[84] He also passed Jason Terry for 8th in the career 3-pointers made list.[85] James also became the second-oldest player to record a triple-double, behind only Karl Malone.[86]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Key dates for 2023-24 NBA season\". *NBA.com*.

It is modeled after the WNBA Commissioner's Cup and in-season multi-stage competitions held in European soccer. The tournament is structured as follows:[36][37][38]\n\n\n\n* Six intraconference pools of five.\n* Tuesdays and Fridays during November will feature group games against each of the other teams in their pool (two at home and two on the road). These games will still count as regular season games.\n* The winners of each pool and two wild-card teams will advance to a single-elimination tournament.\n* The semifinals and championship game will be played in Las Vegas.\n* Players for the tournament champion will each receive $500,000.\n* To compensate, the NBA's regular season scheduling formula will be modified so only 80 games for each team are initially announced during the offseason. The first two rounds of the in-season tournament would then count as regular season games 81 and 82. The championship game would then be an extra 83rd game that would not count toward the regular season. Teams that do not qualify for the in-season tournament, or are eliminated in the quarterfinals, would then be scheduled additional games against each other that are eliminated in the same conference (if possible) and round to reach 82 games.\n\n\nThe schedule for the in-season tournament was released on August 15, 2023.[33] The additional conclusion games for those teams that do not qualify for the in-season tournament, or are eliminated in the quarterfinals, will be announced at a later date.\n\n\n\n### Standings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Arenas[edit]\n\n\n* This is the Los Angeles Clippers' final season at Crypto.com Arena, as the team is scheduled move to the new Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, beginning with the 2024–25 season.[42]\n* The Utah Jazz's home arena, known for several years as Vivint Arena, reverted back to its original Delta Center name on July 1, 2023 as the team came to a new naming rights agreement with Delta Airlines.[43]\n* The San Antonio Spurs' home arena, formerly known as AT&T Center, was renamed Frost Bank Center on August 3, 2023.[44][45]\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### National[edit]\n\n\n#### Linear television[edit]\n\n\nThis is the eighth year of a nine-year deal with ABC, ESPN, TNT, and NBA TV.[46] ESPN has Wednesday and Friday night games during most of the regular season, along with selected Sunday games from February to April, and a Monday night doubleheader on March 18.[47] TNT has Tuesday games, and Thursday games during opening week and again from January to April.[48] NBA TV televises games primarily on Mondays all season, Saturday and Sunday nights for most of the season, Thursdays during the first half of the season, Fridays during the second half of the season, and any other time when the other national broadcasters are not airing games.[49] ABC's schedule includes *NBA Saturday Primetime* games on selected Saturdays between December and March (including a tripleheader on January 27), and *NBA Sunday Showcase* games on four selected Sunday afternoons in February and March.[47] On October 2, 2023, it was announced that five January games originally scheduled as part of ESPN's Wednesday doubleheaders would instead air on ABC.[50]\n\n\nFor the NBA in-season tournament, TNT and ESPN will air selected group stage games as part of their regular Tuesday and Friday coverage, respectively. NBA TV will also have two on Friday, November 24.[51] During the knockout stage, TNT will air all four quarterfinals on December 4 and 5. For the semifinals on December 7, ESPN will televise the early game and TNT will have the late game. The championship game on Saturday, December 9 will be on ABC as part of a special *NBA Saturday Primetime*.[52] During these weeks, ESPN and NBA TV will continue to air other regular season games on Wednesdays and other days, including ESPN's coverage of consolation games on December 6 and December 8.[47][53]\n\n\nFive Christmas Day games are scheduled for this season. With Christmas Day falling on a Monday in 2023, the NFL also scheduled a *Monday Night Football* on that day. Because ABC/ESPN holds the broadcast rights to both NBA Christmas games and *Monday Night Football*, it was decided that ESPN will again air all five NBA games, but ABC will only simulcast two of them in favor of exclusively airing the *Monday Night Football* game. This would mark the first time since 2016 that ABC will televise fewer than three NBA Christmas games.[47]\n\n\nFour Martin Luther King Jr. Day games will be televised nationally, with TNT and NBA TV airing two apiece.[2][48][49]\n\n\nOn January 23–27, the league will hold \"NBA Rivals Week\" for the second consecutive season, with every nationally televised game featuring \"classic and budding rivalries between teams and players\".[2]\n\n\nOn the final day of the regular season, Sunday, April 14, two games with playoff implications will be flexed into ESPN's afternoon doubleheader.[2][47]\n\n\n\n#### Streaming[edit]\n\n\nThis is the first regular season that the streaming service Max will have live access to TNT's games on its Bleacher Report Sports Add-on tier.[54]\n\n\nNBA League Pass will continue to offer out-of-market games, live access to NBA TV, and on-demand replays of every game.\n\n\n\n### Local[edit]\n\n\nThe Washington Wizards' broadcaster became Monumental Sports Network prior to the start of the season. In September 2022, Ted Leonsis's Monumental Sports & Entertainment bought out NBCUniversal's ownership stake in what was then its Regional Network brand, NBC Sports Washington.[55][56]\n\n\n\n#### Diamond Sports Group bankruptcy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Diamond Sports Group § Bankruptcy\n\nThe 16 NBA teams who had deals with the Bally Sports regional sports networks may be affected by its operator Diamond Sports Group's March 14, 2023, decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Diamond had initially sought to continue broadcasting regional games while it plans to separate from majority parent Sinclair Broadcast Group as part of the reorganization.[57]\n\n\nOn April 20, 2023, the Phoenix Suns signed a five-year agreement with Gray Television to replace Bally Sports Arizona as their broadcaster. Most Suns games would then be carried on broadcast television by Gray's KTVK, KPHO-TV, or KPHE-LD in Phoenix (as well as Tucson sister station KOLD-DT5, a new Gray station in Flagstaff, KAZF, and a new Gray station in Yuma, KAZS, with the latter two launching before the season starts). The Suns will also operate an over-the-top subscription service called \"Suns Live\", which is created by Kiswe.[58][59][60] After the announcement, Diamond accused the team of breaching its contract and bankruptcy law, stating that the team was making an \"improper effort\" to \"change their broadcasting partner without permitting Diamond to exercise our contractual rights.\" In response, Phoenix Suns CEO Josh Bartelstein stated that \"Diamond's position is totally inaccurate. We are moving forward with this deal and could not be more excited about what it means for our fans and our future.\"[58][59][61] On May 10, 2023, the bankruptcy judge voided the Suns contract with Gray, ruling that the Suns violated Bally Sports Arizona's contractual right of first refusal. He ordered the parties into arbitration.[62] On July 14, 2023, the deal became official when Diamond declined to match Gray's contract offer, going forward with the intended plan of theirs, only removing CBS 5 from the initial list that included 3TV and Arizona's Family Sports.[63] With Bally Sports later losing airing rights to the Arizona Diamondbacks to the MLB itself and the NHL's Arizona Coyotes to Scripps Sports, Bally Sports Arizona ended up shutting down services on October 21, 2023.\n\n\nOn October 1, 2023, Diamond Sports missed a payment to the Orlando Magic. However, on November 6, 2023, Diamond Sports and the NBA reached a one-year agreement that will result in the contracts for teams airing on Diamond expiring after the 2023–24 NBA season, but will result in the Magic being paid in the process. Across the board, all NBA teams airing on Diamond Sports will receive a 16% reduction in the money they receive, but teams will now be able to sell 10 games of their choosing to local over-the-air networks. However, the deal still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court first.[64][65]\n\n\n\n#### AT&T SportsNet closure[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was winding down its AT&T SportsNet regional sports network business, affecting the Houston Rockets and the Utah Jazz's broadcasters, AT&T SportsNet Southwest and AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain, respectively. The Portland Trail Blazers' deal with Root Sports Northwest is not affected because Warner Bros. Discovery only has minority control of that network.[66][67]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Jazz reached an agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group owned stations KJZZ-TV and KUTV to become its new television home. Jazz owner Ryan Smith will start a new in-house production division, SEG Media, to produce the telecasts. While all games will air on KJZZ, Sinclair retains the right to carry select telecasts on KUTV, and KUTV will maintain an \"official station\" relationship with the team, allowing more coverage of the Jazz and its players. The deal will also include a streaming service, which will not involve KJZZ-TV.[68] AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain later rebranded itself to just SportsNet Rocky Mountain before shutting down services on October 21, 2023.\n\n\nThe Houston Rockets and the MLB's Houston Astros took over ownership of AT&T SportsNet Southwest, rebranding it as Space City Home Network on October 3, 2023.[69]\n\n\n\n### Personnel[edit]\n\n\nAs part of a wave of layoffs, ESPN released analysts Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy, and replaced them with Doris Burke and Doc Rivers on the lead announce team with Mike Breen.[70]\n\n\nBoston Celtics television announcer Mike Gorman announced his retirement effective after this season.[71] For this season, Gorman is only calling home games, with Drew Carter taking over for preseason and road games. Carter was also announced as Gorman's successor effective next season.[72]\n\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets added Noah Eagle, son of primary television announcer Ian Eagle, to the broadcast team calling select games. The younger Eagle is expected to call around 10 games in lieu of Ian and secondary announcer Ryan Ruocco.[73]\n\n\n\n## Notable occurrences[edit]\n\n\n* On July 25, 2023, Jaylen Brown signed a five-year, $304 million contract extension with the Boston Celtics, the largest and richest in league history.[74]\n* On October 25, 2023, Victor Wembanyama scored three 3-pointers in his regular season debut, the most by a Spurs rookie in a single game.[75]\n* On October 31, 2023, Kevin Durant passed Hakeem Olajuwon for 12th on the league's all-time scoring list.[76]\n* On November 1, 2023, LeBron James scored 35 points in the Los Angeles Lakers' 130–125 overtime victory against the Los Angeles Clippers. His performance marked his 81st 30-point game since turning 35 years old in December 2019, surpassing Karl Malone for the most 30-point games by any player since turning 35 in NBA history.[77]\n* On November 1, 2023, Stephen Curry became the first player in NBA history to score at least one three-pointer in 250 consecutive regular season games.[78]\n* On November 6, 2023, Nikola Jokić passed LeBron James and Jason Kidd for the 4th place on the NBA all-time triple-double list.[79]\n* For the second consecutive season, the league did not schedule regular season games on Election Day in the United States, which fell on November 7.[2]\n* On November 14, 2023, an altercation occurred during a game between the Golden State Warriors and the Minnesota Timberwolves.[80] As a result of the incident, Draymond Green was suspended for five games.[81] Green was also fined for the same reason, alongside Klay Thompson, Rudy Gobert, and Jaden McDaniels.[82][83]\n* On November 15, 2023, LeBron James passed Jason Kidd for 5th on the all-time triple-doubles list.[84] He also passed Jason Terry for 8th in the career 3-pointers made list.[85] James also became the second-oldest player to record a triple-double, behind only Karl Malone.[86]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Key dates for 2023-24 NBA season\". *NBA.com*.
