Kenney was first elected on November 3, 2015, defeating his Republican rival Melissa Murray Bailey after winning the crowded Democratic primary contest by a landslide on May 19.[1]\n\n\nBefore he became mayor, Kenney was a member of the Philadelphia City Council for 23 years, serving as a Councilman at Large from January 1992 until January 29, 2015, when he resigned to run for mayor.[1][2][3]\n\n\nKenney was re-elected to a second term as mayor on November 5, 2019. His term will expire in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJim Kenney was born on August 7, 1958, in the Whitman neighborhood of South Philadelphia. His father was a firefighter and his mother was a homemaker. His parents both worked second jobs to put Jim and his four siblings through private Catholic schools. In high school, Kenney was a newspaper deliveryman and busboy.[4] Kenney graduated from Saint Joseph's Preparatory School in 1976 and in 1980 received a political science bachelor's degree from La Salle University.[3] He was the first in his family to graduate from college.\n\n\n\n![](image)City Councilman Jim Kenney in 2009\n## Philadelphia City Council[edit]\n\n\nKenney was elected to his first term in 1991 when he was 32 years old. During his time on Philadelphia's City Council, Kenney served as Chairman of the Council Committee on Labor and Civil Service. He was also Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Rules, Committee on the Environment, and Committee on Law and Government, and was a member of the Committee on Public Safety, Technology and Information Services, Public Property and Public Works, Fiscal Stability and Intergovernmental Cooperation, Public Health and Human Services, and the Legislative Oversight Committee.[5]\n\n\nIn 2010, Kenney sided with the local firefighters' union when Mayor Nutter took action to remove the collective bargaining rights of paramedics.[6]\n\n\nIn 2014, Kenney successfully introduced legislation that ended arrests for possession of small amounts of marijuana. The bill replaced incarceration with the requirement to pay a fine. In advocating for the bill, Kenney had cited the disproportionate effect of arrests for small amounts of marijuana on African-Americans.[7] Philadelphia became the largest city in the country to decriminalize marijuana.[8]\n\n\nKenney garnered criticism from local and national economic commentators when he proposed bonus pension payments, distributing funds when pension plans exceed target returns in any given year even though solvency depends on retaining above-average earnings to prepare for years with below-average earnings.[9][10]\n\n\nWhile on the Philadelphia City Council, Kenney worked as a consultant at Vitetta Architects and Engineers, served on the Independence Blue Cross board, and was an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.[11] He gave up these positions when he was elected mayor in 2015.\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2015 Philadelphia mayoral election and 2019 Philadelphia mayoral election\n\nIncumbent Democratic Mayor Michael Nutter could not run for re-election to a third consecutive term due to the home-rule charter's two-term limit. Registered Democrats hold a formidable 7-to-1 ratio over registered Republicans in Philadelphia, giving Democratic candidates a distinct advantage in citywide elections. The mayoral primary elections were held on May 19, 2015. Kenney won the primary in a landslide with 55.83% of the vote, defeating a crowded field of five other Democratic candidates, including Anthony H. Williams and former District Attorney Lynn Abraham. Republican Melissa Murray Bailey, a business executive, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination. Kenney won with 85.1% of the vote.[12] Kenney was inaugurated as the 99th Mayor of Philadelphia on January 4, 2016.\n\n\nKenney was reelected as mayor in 2019. The Democratic primary was held on May 21, 2019, and he defeated former City Controller Alan Butkovitz and Pennsylvania State Senator Anthony Hardy Williams with 67% of the vote.[13] On November 5, 2019, Kenney won re-election by defeating Billy Ciancaglini, a Philadelphia defense attorney and fellow La Salle grad, in the general election[14] with more than 80% of the vote.[15]\n\n\n\n### First term (2016–2020)[edit]\n\n\n#### Education[edit]\n\n\n##### Sugary drinks tax[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sugary drink tax § Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nKenney proposed a citywide soda tax that would raise the price of soda at three cents per ounce, originally with the intent to raise money for universal pre-k.[16] At the time, it was the biggest soda tax proposal in the United States. Kenney promoted using tax revenue to fund universal pre-K, jobs, and development projects, which he expected would raise $400 million over five years, all the while reducing sugar intake by decreasing the demand for sugary beverages[17] Kenney's soda tax proposal was brought to the national spotlight and divided key members of the Democratic Party. The idea of a soda tax quickly became a national issue. Candidates in the 2016 United States presidential election gave their take. Senator Bernie Sanders said that the tax would hurt the poor.[18] Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, said that she was \"very supportive\" of the idea.[19] The lobbying organization American Beverage Association took a stand against Kenney's proposal. The trade organization, funded by soda companies and distributors, ran local television, radio, and newspaper advertisements against the idea, claiming that the tax would disproportionately hurt the poor. The American Heart Association, on the other hand, has supported Kenney's efforts. On June 16, 2016, the soda tax passed with a 13–4 vote from City Council. The initial proposal of three cents per ounce was lowered to 1.5 cents per ounce. The tax was implemented at the start of the 2017 calendar year.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jim Kenney (left) with then Secretary of Labor Tom Perez (right) in a Philadelphia factory\nAfter the tax took effect, Kenney said retailers' price gouging blamed on the tax and charging the tax on items not subject to it was \"wrong\" and \"misleading\".[21] In February 2017, soda manufacturers and retailers announced sales declines of 30–50% in Philadelphia and announced layoffs for March. The city called the predicted layoffs \"fear-mongering\". While the tax was projected to raise about $2.7 million in its first month, far below the estimate of $7.6 million per month, the city expected that figure to rise.[22]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Pepsi announced plans to lay off between 80 and 100 employees, and blamed this on the tax. The city stated the program had created 251 jobs, mostly full-time pre-K teaching positions and said the soda industry was \"holding hostage the jobs of hard-working people in their battle to overturn the tax. Pepsi reported nearly $35 billion in gross income and $6 billion in profit last year.... The idea that they can afford to do that but 'must lay off workers' should make every Philadelphian very skeptical of whether these layoffs are actually due to the tax.\" The layoffs would occur at plants in Philadelphia and Wilmington which are run as independent businesses.[23]\n\n\nIn May 2019, the University of Pennsylvania released a study describing the aftermath of the soda tax, two years later. Total volume sales of taxed beverages in Philadelphia decreased by 1.3 billion ounces (from 2.475 billion to 1.214 billion) or by 51.0% after tax implementation. Volume sales in the Pennsylvania border zip codes, however, increased by 308.2 million ounces (from 713.1 million to 1.021 billion), offsetting 24.4% of the decrease in Philadelphia's sales volume.[24]\n\n\nThe sugary drinks tax became an issue in the 2019 mayoral election, with the American Beverage Association spending $521,196 to run advertisements opposing Kenney's reelection.[25]\n\n\n\n##### Local control[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Mayor Kenney announced that the city was taking back control of its public schools after sixteen years of state control. In an address to City Council, Kenney outlined the end of the state-dominated School Reform Commission and a path to local control of the Philadelphia School District by July 1, 2018.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Opioid epidemic[edit]\n\n\nKenney created *The Mayor's Task Force to Combat the Opioid Epidemic in Philadelphia* in 2016. The committee concluded its work and presented a final proposal in May 2017.[27]\n\n\nIn June of that year, Kenney and U.S. Representative Bob Brady negotiated a deal with Conrail, the company that owns abandoned train tracks in Kensington that became a well-known area for open-air heroin use, to clean up the property.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kenney at an urban national wildlife refuge event in 2016\nKenney has supported opening supervised injection sites within the city. On January 23, 2018, Philadelphia's Public Health Commissioner, Dr. Thomas Farley, announced he wants the city to establish one or more in the city. He cited Vancouver, stating overdose deaths have been reduced, as has the spread of diseases like HIV and hepatitis C.[29]\n\n\nOther city officials differ. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross has publicly stated he is \"totally adamant against\" the idea, but has an open mind and a lot of questions. Kenney has also said he supports the recommendation. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro disagrees that the sites are an effective path to treatment and suggested changes would be needed in both state and federal laws in order for such sites to operate legally.[30][31]\n\n\nThe 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Kenney's efforts to open safe injections sites. The Court relied on a federal law known as the \"Crack House\" statute.[32]\n\n\n\n#### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nKenney has committed the City of Philadelphia to reduce air pollution and city-wide emissions with specific projects aimed at reforming their respective transit and buildings sectors, areas which are typically responsible for 80 percent total of all citywide emissions and over which mayors have significant authority.[33]\n\n\n\n#### Opposition to Donald Trump[edit]\n\n\nBefore and after Donald Trump's election as President in 2016, Kenney has taken a vocal stand against Trump and his policies. Kenney has maintained that Philadelphia will continue to act as a sanctuary city despite threats that cities would stop receiving federal funding.[34] Trump said, \"Here in Philadelphia, murder has been steady—I mean—just terribly increasing.\"[35]\n\n\nKenney, along with Democratic colleagues Representative Dwight Evans, Senator Bob Casey Jr., Councilwoman Helen Gym, and Governor Tom Wolf, joined protesters at Philadelphia International Airport after Trump signed Executive Order 13769 to ban travel from seven majority-Muslim countries.[36]\n\n\nOn October 23, 2019, Kenney endorsed Elizabeth Warren for president in 2020.[37]\n\n\nOn November 6, while the US awaited the final few results of the 2020 election, Kenney gave remarks aimed at Donald Trump: \"What the president needs to do is, frankly, put his big boy pants on, acknowledge that he lost, and congratulate the winner.\" The statement was made in the interest of the nation moving forwards, and Kenney cited several former presidents and presidential candidates, including George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, and Al Gore.[38]\n\n\n\n### Second term (2020–present)[edit]\n\n\n#### COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Kenney declared state of emergency amid the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic has resulted in severe social and economic disruption around the world, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s. In Philadelphia, COVID has led to widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, agricultural disruption, and food shortages, as well as increased gun violence, opioid usage, and housing insecurity. Kenny has referred to COVID as a \"nuclear bomb\" because of the way it affected the city.[39]\n\n\n\n#### 2020 Black Lives Matter protests[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Killing of Walter Wallace\n\nDuring the summer of 2020, Kenney approved the use of CS gas on protestors during a peaceful protest, who were blocking traffic, on Interstate 676.[40]\n\n\nIn response to protests over the murder of George Floyd, Kenney had the Center City statue of Frank Rizzo removed in June 2020.[41]\n\n\n\n## Feuds[edit]\n\n\nKenney was known for his outspoken feuds and reports on public figures or groups who attack his legislative agenda, image, or the city of Philadelphia. Early in his career, Kenney was known as a candid and opinionated councilman and mayor, particularly on social media platforms like Twitter.[42] Since his election as Mayor of Philadelphia, Kenney has taken a much more measured tone with respect to his political opponents.[43]\n\n\n\n### Archdiocese[edit]\n\n\nKenney has engaged in numerous feuds with the leadership of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Kenney mobilized numerous gay rights legislation during his time in the Philadelphia City Council, many of which were criticized by Catholic leaders in the city. Notably, Kenney joined the debate over the abrupt firing of a beloved faculty member at Waldron Mercy Academy in Merion who came out as gay. In a *Philadelphia Inquirer* story, Kenney accused the \"cowardly men\" in the Archdiocese of orchestrating the firing: \"If you're a church official and you feel that strongly that this woman and her partner are such a threat to society, stand up and say so,\" Kenney told the paper.[44] In a 2014 tweet, Kenney stated, \"The Arch *[sic]* don't care about people. It's about image and money. Pope Francis needs to kick some ass here!\"[45]\n\n\n\n### Sports talk radio[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia sports radio host Howard Eskin has used his talk show to blast Kenney and his authorization of the sugary drinks tax. In April 2017, Kenney appeared on Eskin's radio station, 94.1 WIP, to contend his claims and promote the 2017 NFL draft in Philly. Kenney attacked Eskin, saying, \"Here's what I don't understand about Eskin. First of all, he's in that prime spot of 8–10 a.m. on Saturday mornings... I mean like, it's like the show should be called 'The Sound of One Hand Clapping.' Cause no one hears it.\"[46] Kenney also jokingly said that he would handle things differently with Eskin if he weren't mayor. \"If we were regular people sitting at a bar and he was doing that to me, there would be a consequence,\" Kenney said. \"But because I am an elected official, I can't do it.\"[47]\n\n\n\n### Chris Christie[edit]\n\n\nFormer New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a self-proclaimed Dallas Cowboys fan, has frequently slammed the Philadelphia Eagles, one of the Cowboys' biggest rivals. In early 2017, Christie called Philadelphia fans \"angry, awful people\" and said Citizens Bank Park, the home of the Philadelphia Phillies, \"is not safe for civilized people.\" Kenney went on a local sports talk radio program to respond to Christie's claims. \"He's got the biggest 'L' on his forehead of anybody in the country. He ran for president for one hot-mess minute and then when that was over he was moon-dogging Trump thinking he was going to get a big job,\" Kenney said. \"Now I think he's just bitter and has got nowhere to go. Who's going to hire him? I just think he's just done,\" Kenney said. \"Bullies always lose, and he's a bully.\"[48]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKenney has two adult children, Nora and Brendan, with his former wife Maureen. Kenney and Maureen separated in 2010.[49] They formally divorced in 2018.[50]\n\n\nKenney is engaged to Letitia Santarelli.[50] Santarelli was the head coach of the St. John Neumann and Maria Goretti Catholic School girls basketball team, taking the school to the state championship. The couple started dating in 2015.[51]\nKenney first made his relationship with Santarelli public when she accompanied him to Iceland as part of a cultural exchange to mark the first-ever direct flights between Reykjavík and Philadelphia in 2017.[52]\n\n\nKenney has been an annual participant in Philadelphia's Mummers Parade.[53]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the United States\n* List of La Salle University people\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hepp, Chris (May 20, 2015). \"Landslide: Kenney romps in Philly mayor's race\". *Philadelphia Inquirer*.

Kenney was first elected on November 3, 2015, defeating his Republican rival Melissa Murray Bailey after winning the crowded Democratic primary contest by a landslide on May 19.[1]\n\n\nBefore he became mayor, Kenney was a member of the Philadelphia City Council for 23 years, serving as a Councilman at Large from January 1992 until January 29, 2015, when he resigned to run for mayor.[1][2][3]\n\n\nKenney was re-elected to a second term as mayor on November 5, 2019. His term will expire in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJim Kenney was born on August 7, 1958, in the Whitman neighborhood of South Philadelphia. His father was a firefighter and his mother was a homemaker. His parents both worked second jobs to put Jim and his four siblings through private Catholic schools. In high school, Kenney was a newspaper deliveryman and busboy.[4] Kenney graduated from Saint Joseph's Preparatory School in 1976 and in 1980 received a political science bachelor's degree from La Salle University.[3] He was the first in his family to graduate from college.\n\n\n\n![](image)City Councilman Jim Kenney in 2009\n## Philadelphia City Council[edit]\n\n\nKenney was elected to his first term in 1991 when he was 32 years old. During his time on Philadelphia's City Council, Kenney served as Chairman of the Council Committee on Labor and Civil Service. He was also Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Rules, Committee on the Environment, and Committee on Law and Government, and was a member of the Committee on Public Safety, Technology and Information Services, Public Property and Public Works, Fiscal Stability and Intergovernmental Cooperation, Public Health and Human Services, and the Legislative Oversight Committee.[5]\n\n\nIn 2010, Kenney sided with the local firefighters' union when Mayor Nutter took action to remove the collective bargaining rights of paramedics.[6]\n\n\nIn 2014, Kenney successfully introduced legislation that ended arrests for possession of small amounts of marijuana. The bill replaced incarceration with the requirement to pay a fine. In advocating for the bill, Kenney had cited the disproportionate effect of arrests for small amounts of marijuana on African-Americans.[7] Philadelphia became the largest city in the country to decriminalize marijuana.[8]\n\n\nKenney garnered criticism from local and national economic commentators when he proposed bonus pension payments, distributing funds when pension plans exceed target returns in any given year even though solvency depends on retaining above-average earnings to prepare for years with below-average earnings.[9][10]\n\n\nWhile on the Philadelphia City Council, Kenney worked as a consultant at Vitetta Architects and Engineers, served on the Independence Blue Cross board, and was an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.[11] He gave up these positions when he was elected mayor in 2015.\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2015 Philadelphia mayoral election and 2019 Philadelphia mayoral election\n\nIncumbent Democratic Mayor Michael Nutter could not run for re-election to a third consecutive term due to the home-rule charter's two-term limit. Registered Democrats hold a formidable 7-to-1 ratio over registered Republicans in Philadelphia, giving Democratic candidates a distinct advantage in citywide elections. The mayoral primary elections were held on May 19, 2015. Kenney won the primary in a landslide with 55.83% of the vote, defeating a crowded field of five other Democratic candidates, including Anthony H. Williams and former District Attorney Lynn Abraham. Republican Melissa Murray Bailey, a business executive, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination. Kenney won with 85.1% of the vote.[12] Kenney was inaugurated as the 99th Mayor of Philadelphia on January 4, 2016.\n\n\nKenney was reelected as mayor in 2019. The Democratic primary was held on May 21, 2019, and he defeated former City Controller Alan Butkovitz and Pennsylvania State Senator Anthony Hardy Williams with 67% of the vote.[13] On November 5, 2019, Kenney won re-election by defeating Billy Ciancaglini, a Philadelphia defense attorney and fellow La Salle grad, in the general election[14] with more than 80% of the vote.[15]\n\n\n\n### First term (2016–2020)[edit]\n\n\n#### Education[edit]\n\n\n##### Sugary drinks tax[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sugary drink tax § Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nKenney proposed a citywide soda tax that would raise the price of soda at three cents per ounce, originally with the intent to raise money for universal pre-k.[16] At the time, it was the biggest soda tax proposal in the United States. Kenney promoted using tax revenue to fund universal pre-K, jobs, and development projects, which he expected would raise $400 million over five years, all the while reducing sugar intake by decreasing the demand for sugary beverages[17] Kenney's soda tax proposal was brought to the national spotlight and divided key members of the Democratic Party. The idea of a soda tax quickly became a national issue. Candidates in the 2016 United States presidential election gave their take. Senator Bernie Sanders said that the tax would hurt the poor.[18] Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, said that she was \"very supportive\" of the idea.[19] The lobbying organization American Beverage Association took a stand against Kenney's proposal. The trade organization, funded by soda companies and distributors, ran local television, radio, and newspaper advertisements against the idea, claiming that the tax would disproportionately hurt the poor. The American Heart Association, on the other hand, has supported Kenney's efforts. On June 16, 2016, the soda tax passed with a 13–4 vote from City Council. The initial proposal of three cents per ounce was lowered to 1.5 cents per ounce. The tax was implemented at the start of the 2017 calendar year.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jim Kenney (left) with then Secretary of Labor Tom Perez (right) in a Philadelphia factory\nAfter the tax took effect, Kenney said retailers' price gouging blamed on the tax and charging the tax on items not subject to it was \"wrong\" and \"misleading\".[21] In February 2017, soda manufacturers and retailers announced sales declines of 30–50% in Philadelphia and announced layoffs for March. The city called the predicted layoffs \"fear-mongering\". While the tax was projected to raise about $2.7 million in its first month, far below the estimate of $7.6 million per month, the city expected that figure to rise.[22]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Pepsi announced plans to lay off between 80 and 100 employees, and blamed this on the tax. The city stated the program had created 251 jobs, mostly full-time pre-K teaching positions and said the soda industry was \"holding hostage the jobs of hard-working people in their battle to overturn the tax. Pepsi reported nearly $35 billion in gross income and $6 billion in profit last year.... The idea that they can afford to do that but 'must lay off workers' should make every Philadelphian very skeptical of whether these layoffs are actually due to the tax.\" The layoffs would occur at plants in Philadelphia and Wilmington which are run as independent businesses.[23]\n\n\nIn May 2019, the University of Pennsylvania released a study describing the aftermath of the soda tax, two years later. Total volume sales of taxed beverages in Philadelphia decreased by 1.3 billion ounces (from 2.475 billion to 1.214 billion) or by 51.0% after tax implementation. Volume sales in the Pennsylvania border zip codes, however, increased by 308.2 million ounces (from 713.1 million to 1.021 billion), offsetting 24.4% of the decrease in Philadelphia's sales volume.[24]\n\n\nThe sugary drinks tax became an issue in the 2019 mayoral election, with the American Beverage Association spending $521,196 to run advertisements opposing Kenney's reelection.[25]\n\n\n\n##### Local control[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Mayor Kenney announced that the city was taking back control of its public schools after sixteen years of state control. In an address to City Council, Kenney outlined the end of the state-dominated School Reform Commission and a path to local control of the Philadelphia School District by July 1, 2018.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Opioid epidemic[edit]\n\n\nKenney created *The Mayor's Task Force to Combat the Opioid Epidemic in Philadelphia* in 2016. The committee concluded its work and presented a final proposal in May 2017.[27]\n\n\nIn June of that year, Kenney and U.S. Representative Bob Brady negotiated a deal with Conrail, the company that owns abandoned train tracks in Kensington that became a well-known area for open-air heroin use, to clean up the property.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kenney at an urban national wildlife refuge event in 2016\nKenney has supported opening supervised injection sites within the city. On January 23, 2018, Philadelphia's Public Health Commissioner, Dr. Thomas Farley, announced he wants the city to establish one or more in the city. He cited Vancouver, stating overdose deaths have been reduced, as has the spread of diseases like HIV and hepatitis C.[29]\n\n\nOther city officials differ. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross has publicly stated he is \"totally adamant against\" the idea, but has an open mind and a lot of questions. Kenney has also said he supports the recommendation. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro disagrees that the sites are an effective path to treatment and suggested changes would be needed in both state and federal laws in order for such sites to operate legally.[30][31]\n\n\nThe 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Kenney's efforts to open safe injections sites. The Court relied on a federal law known as the \"Crack House\" statute.[32]\n\n\n\n#### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nKenney has committed the City of Philadelphia to reduce air pollution and city-wide emissions with specific projects aimed at reforming their respective transit and buildings sectors, areas which are typically responsible for 80 percent total of all citywide emissions and over which mayors have significant authority.[33]\n\n\n\n#### Opposition to Donald Trump[edit]\n\n\nBefore and after Donald Trump's election as President in 2016, Kenney has taken a vocal stand against Trump and his policies. Kenney has maintained that Philadelphia will continue to act as a sanctuary city despite threats that cities would stop receiving federal funding.[34] Trump said, \"Here in Philadelphia, murder has been steady—I mean—just terribly increasing.\"[35]\n\n\nKenney, along with Democratic colleagues Representative Dwight Evans, Senator Bob Casey Jr., Councilwoman Helen Gym, and Governor Tom Wolf, joined protesters at Philadelphia International Airport after Trump signed Executive Order 13769 to ban travel from seven majority-Muslim countries.[36]\n\n\nOn October 23, 2019, Kenney endorsed Elizabeth Warren for president in 2020.[37]\n\n\nOn November 6, while the US awaited the final few results of the 2020 election, Kenney gave remarks aimed at Donald Trump: \"What the president needs to do is, frankly, put his big boy pants on, acknowledge that he lost, and congratulate the winner.\" The statement was made in the interest of the nation moving forwards, and Kenney cited several former presidents and presidential candidates, including George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, and Al Gore.[38]\n\n\n\n### Second term (2020–present)[edit]\n\n\n#### COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Kenney declared state of emergency amid the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic has resulted in severe social and economic disruption around the world, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s. In Philadelphia, COVID has led to widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, agricultural disruption, and food shortages, as well as increased gun violence, opioid usage, and housing insecurity. Kenny has referred to COVID as a \"nuclear bomb\" because of the way it affected the city.[39]\n\n\n\n#### 2020 Black Lives Matter protests[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Killing of Walter Wallace\n\nDuring the summer of 2020, Kenney approved the use of CS gas on protestors during a peaceful protest, who were blocking traffic, on Interstate 676.[40]\n\n\nIn response to protests over the murder of George Floyd, Kenney had the Center City statue of Frank Rizzo removed in June 2020.[41]\n\n\n\n## Feuds[edit]\n\n\nKenney was known for his outspoken feuds and reports on public figures or groups who attack his legislative agenda, image, or the city of Philadelphia. Early in his career, Kenney was known as a candid and opinionated councilman and mayor, particularly on social media platforms like Twitter.[42] Since his election as Mayor of Philadelphia, Kenney has taken a much more measured tone with respect to his political opponents.[43]\n\n\n\n### Archdiocese[edit]\n\n\nKenney has engaged in numerous feuds with the leadership of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Kenney mobilized numerous gay rights legislation during his time in the Philadelphia City Council, many of which were criticized by Catholic leaders in the city. Notably, Kenney joined the debate over the abrupt firing of a beloved faculty member at Waldron Mercy Academy in Merion who came out as gay. In a *Philadelphia Inquirer* story, Kenney accused the \"cowardly men\" in the Archdiocese of orchestrating the firing: \"If you're a church official and you feel that strongly that this woman and her partner are such a threat to society, stand up and say so,\" Kenney told the paper.[44] In a 2014 tweet, Kenney stated, \"The Arch *[sic]* don't care about people. It's about image and money. Pope Francis needs to kick some ass here!\"[45]\n\n\n\n### Sports talk radio[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia sports radio host Howard Eskin has used his talk show to blast Kenney and his authorization of the sugary drinks tax. In April 2017, Kenney appeared on Eskin's radio station, 94.1 WIP, to contend his claims and promote the 2017 NFL draft in Philly. Kenney attacked Eskin, saying, \"Here's what I don't understand about Eskin. First of all, he's in that prime spot of 8–10 a.m. on Saturday mornings... I mean like, it's like the show should be called 'The Sound of One Hand Clapping.' Cause no one hears it.\"[46] Kenney also jokingly said that he would handle things differently with Eskin if he weren't mayor. \"If we were regular people sitting at a bar and he was doing that to me, there would be a consequence,\" Kenney said. \"But because I am an elected official, I can't do it.\"[47]\n\n\n\n### Chris Christie[edit]\n\n\nFormer New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a self-proclaimed Dallas Cowboys fan, has frequently slammed the Philadelphia Eagles, one of the Cowboys' biggest rivals. In early 2017, Christie called Philadelphia fans \"angry, awful people\" and said Citizens Bank Park, the home of the Philadelphia Phillies, \"is not safe for civilized people.\" Kenney went on a local sports talk radio program to respond to Christie's claims. \"He's got the biggest 'L' on his forehead of anybody in the country. He ran for president for one hot-mess minute and then when that was over he was moon-dogging Trump thinking he was going to get a big job,\" Kenney said. \"Now I think he's just bitter and has got nowhere to go. Who's going to hire him? I just think he's just done,\" Kenney said. \"Bullies always lose, and he's a bully.\"[48]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKenney has two adult children, Nora and Brendan, with his former wife Maureen. Kenney and Maureen separated in 2010.[49] They formally divorced in 2018.[50]\n\n\nKenney is engaged to Letitia Santarelli.[50] Santarelli was the head coach of the St. John Neumann and Maria Goretti Catholic School girls basketball team, taking the school to the state championship. The couple started dating in 2015.[51]\nKenney first made his relationship with Santarelli public when she accompanied him to Iceland as part of a cultural exchange to mark the first-ever direct flights between Reykjavík and Philadelphia in 2017.[52]\n\n\nKenney has been an annual participant in Philadelphia's Mummers Parade.[53]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the United States\n* List of La Salle University people\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hepp, Chris (May 20, 2015). \"Landslide: Kenney romps in Philly mayor's race\". *Philadelphia Inquirer*.

A member of the Democratic Party, he is also a former member of the Philadelphia City Council from the 4th district and had served as the 52nd Ward Democratic Leader until 1990.[1] Nutter also served as the President of the United States Conference of Mayors from 2012 to 2013, and is a former member of the Homeland Security Advisory Council.[2]\n\n\nCurrently, he is the David N. Dinkins Professor of Professional Practice in Urban and Public Affairs at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(August 2012)*\n |\n\n\nNutter was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up in West Philadelphia. Raised Catholic, he attended elementary school at Transfiguration of Our Lord Catholic Elementary School and later St. Joseph's Preparatory School in North Philadelphia.[4][5][6] He graduated from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1979 with a degree in business.[7] During his sophomore year in college, he started working as a DJ at Club Impulse in Philadelphia, where he was known as Mix Master Mike.[8] After graduating from college, Nutter began to work at Xerox, and then at an investment banking firm. While in office, Nutter occasionally worked as DJ and a singer.\n\n\nAs of 2014, Michael Nutter was a member of Mt. Carmel Baptist Church in West Philadelphia.[9]\n\n\n\n## Philadelphia City Council[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nNutter, then-leader of the 52nd ward of Philadelphia, initially challenged Democratic incumbent Ann Land for a seat on the Philadelphia City Council in 1987.[10] Though ultimately unsuccessful in his initial bid, Nutter defeated Land in a rematch four years later.[10]\n\n\nIn February 2003, Nutter was elected chairman of the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority Board.[11]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2002, Nutter introduced a measure requiring college students under 23 years old to register their address, license plate, car registration and insurance with their school, which would then put a sticker on that car as a \"student\" car, subjecting the student to triple the usual fines for traffic or parking tickets or any other offense. The ordinance also forced students in off-campus housing to inform their landlords of their student status.[12]\n\n\nIn September 2004, Nutter introduced legislation creating an independent Ethics Board; in addition, he proposed changes to the city's Ethics Code to provide for routine training and education of all city officers and employees, the issuance of advisory opinions, the adjudication of violations, and the imposition of civil fines. These measures were adopted at the end of 2005. On May 16, 2006, voters approved the Ethics Board ballot question with 81% voting to approve it, and was installed November 27, 2006.[13]\n\n\nNutter sponsored \"The Clean Indoor Air Worker Protection Law,\" expanding the definition of \"public places\" where smoking is not allowed to include restaurants and many bars, which Mayor Street eventually signed into law.[14] Nutter's local bidder preference program, which took effect on July 1, 2004, gives preference to Philadelphia businesses in competitive bidding on City contracts greater than $25,000.[14]\n\n\nIn January 2005, Philadelphia announced a library reorganization plan in which 20 branches would shift from full-day service to half-day service, and that many head librarians would be laid off. Library supporters rejected these changes and petitioned the Mayor and city council to restore service and staffing levels. The City Council rejected the Administration's cut, funding was restored, and by the fall of 2005 all library branches had full-day service, Saturday hours, and a head librarian. As mayor, Nutter sought to close eleven libraries until city council brought a suit that kept the libraries open.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHe supported having the City of Philadelphia declare a \"Crime Emergency\" in selected areas of Philadelphia.[15] This would have stationed more officers in certain areas of Philadelphia, limited the ability to gather on public sidewalks, imposed a curfew for all residents, and limited the ability to travel in certain areas. The proposal included a warrant-less police search technique known as \"stop and frisk.\"[16] Nutter claims that this approach is sufficiently similar to one that was found to be Constitutional by the United States Supreme Court in 1968 in *Terry v. Ohio*, but it still has not been determined if this specific exercise is in violation of Fourth Amendment rights.[17] A version of this plan was later implemented by Nutter and was the target of a lawsuit.[15]\n\n\nNutter has supported the eviction of the Cradle of Liberty Council of the Boy Scouts of America from their headquarters on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, both as a councilman and as mayor. In a televised debate on NBC 10 Live @ Issue he said, \"In my administration, we will not subsidize discrimination.\"[18] The Cradle of Liberty Council of the Boy Scouts of America eventually won their case.\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nutter campaigning in support of Barack Obama.\nMain articles: 2007 Philadelphia mayoral election and 2011 Philadelphia mayoral election\n\nNutter resigned from the city council in 2006 in order to focus on running for mayor the following year;[19] he later resigned as Chairman of the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority Board in April 2007.[20] In his mayoral campaign, he received endorsements from *The Philadelphia Inquirer*,[21] *Philadelphia Daily News*,[22] *Philadelphia* magazine,[23] *Northeast Times*,[24] *Philadelphia City Paper*,[25] *Philadelphia Weekly*,[26] *The Daily Pennsylvanian*,[27] Philly for Change,[28] the Penn Democrats,[29] and Clean Water Action.[30]\n\n\nNutter won the Democratic primary election on May 15 with 37% of the vote;[31] He then went on to win the general election on November 6, 2007, with 83% of the vote against Republican nominee Al Taubenberger's 13%.\n\n\nNutter announced that he would run for reelection on December 22, 2010.[32] He won the primary election against Milton Street with 76% of the vote,[33] and the general election with 75% of the vote.[34]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\n#### PhillyRising[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, Nutter commissioned a pilot project labeled \"Public Service Areas\" to supplement police response with a coordinated effort from other city agencies in areas of the city plagued with chronic issues of crime and disorder. After some initial signs of crime reduction in the Hartranft community of North Philadelphia, the pilot was renamed \"the PhillyRising Collaborative\" and expanded across each of the Philadelphia Police Department's six divisions. Each neighborhood selected for participation in PhillyRising is chosen based on an evaluation data regarding levels of crime, disorder, and other quality of life data.\n\n\nSince its inception in 2010, the PhillyRising Collaborative has supported crime reduction through improved quality of life in some of Philadelphia's most challenged communities. The team has supported active citizens with a variety of strategies, including the creation of three public computer labs (Hartranft, Frankford, & Kensington), and three Citizens' Engagement Academies (Hartranft, Swampoodle/Strawberry Mansion, & Point Breeze) which have produced 65 resident graduates. PhillyRising has also helped re-open the Hartranft Community Pool and brought the Police Athletic League to Hartranft Elementary School. These efforts, and many others, have helped to produce an average reduction of Part 1 Crimes by 4% and Part 2 Crimes by 9.5% after a full year of PhillyRising involvement in the pilot neighborhood. These reductions are significantly greater than those for the surrounding Police District.\n[35]\n\n\n\n#### RISE[edit]\n\n\nThrough Mayoral Executive Order, Nutter created the Mayor's Office of Reintegration Services for Ex-offenders (RISE) prioritizing the needs of returning citizens. Its mission emphasizes and formalizes the commitment of the Nutter Administration to promote safer communities and reduce law enforcement costs, assisting ex-offenders to be constructive individuals who contribute positively to our Philadelphia community, thereby reducing recidivism. As a City department, rather than a contract agency, RISE now has an ability to take lead/coordinator/partner role with grant funding solicitations. There are additional synergies and efficiencies created from the sharing of City resources. RISE has increased reentry activity levels despite a decrease in funding from $3.2 million to $1.4 million. The number of walk-in clients serviced has doubled (944 vs. 2339) and the number of clients enrolled in services has increased (531 vs. 731). In addition, there has been a 31% increase in number of clients employed (180 vs. 253).[35]\n\n\n\n#### Reducing youth violence[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Nutter joined forces with New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu to create Cities United, an initiative committed to reducing African-American male on African-American male violence. Cities United works to prevent violence in a collaborative effort among mayors, foundations, national nonprofits, federal agencies and youth, seeking to place African-American males who are victims and perpetrators of violence at the center of municipal agendas and develop recommendations for a national violence reduction strategy.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nutter speaks to the Knight Foundation in 2012.\nNutter also initiated the Youth Violence Reduction Partnership. The YVRP includes the City Probation & Parole, the Police and the Philadelphia Anti-Drug Anti Violence Network working in targeted police districts to identify youth at risk of becoming involved in crime and providing them support through access to employment, education, mentoring, health care and drug treatment.[35]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Nutter announced *Greenworks*, the city's plan to become the greenest city in America by 2015. *Greenworks* outlines 15 measurable targets and 166 initiatives in five topic areas: energy, environment, equity, economy, and engagement. As of June 21, 2013, 95% of the 166 initiatives were either complete or underway. Four years into the six-year implementation timeline, two-thirds of the targets show trends toward meeting established goals. Some specific highlights of current progress include: reduction of municipal energy use by 7 percent; alternative energy use increase from 2.5 to 14 percent; nearly 90,000 trees planted since 2008; City Council passage of energy bench-marking and disclosure legislation; and 11.6 new miles of trails completed since 2011.[35]\n\n\nIn 2012, Mayor Nutter signed Bill No. 120428 which amends the 'Energy Conservation' portion of the Philadelphia Code to require large commercial buildings to benchmark and report energy and water usage data to the city. The bill's purpose is not only to make organizations aware of their energy use, but also to identify opportunities for improvement and assist in establishing energy consumption baselines that will help set future goals.[35]\n\n\nNutter also implemented the city's first guaranteed energy-savings project at the city's four largest downtown office buildings. In 2011, Nutter began implementing nine energy-conservation measures in the city's largest downtown office buildings.[35]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Nutter established the Mayor's Office of Education to work on the related goals of increasing the high school graduation rate to 80 percent by 2015 and raising the rate of Philadelphia residents with a college degree to 36 percent by 2018. Currently, the on-time high school graduation rate is 64 percent and the percentage of residents with a 4-year college degree or higher is 24.3 percent. Since, 2007, the high school graduation rate has increased by 11 percentage points.[35]\n\n\n\n#### School funding[edit]\n\n\nThe city has increased its annual funding to public education by $155 million since July 2010. [35]\n\n\nOn September 11, 2013, Nutter launched the Philadelphia Education Supplies Fund, a new fundraising campaign to provide funds to schools within the city in order to purchase consumable supplemental classroom supplies, including workbooks, paper, pens, and pencils. This fund was created to alleviate some of the hardships being experienced by high-poverty schools. Under the stated criteria, schools with at least a 50% free and reduced price lunch population were eligible to apply, and those with more than 75% free and reduced-price lunches will receive greater amounts, in each case based on enrollment. The city has contributed $200,000 to the fund, and intends to do the same for at least five years. Over $540,000 was raised for the fund and 255 schools will receive funds, this includes 209 School District of Philadelphia schools, 20 charters, 13 Archdiocesan, and 13 independent/private.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Strengthening K-12 educational systems[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2011, the Great Schools Compact was signed by the city, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the SDP, the Pennsylvania Coalition of Public Charter Schools (PCPCS), the Philadelphia Charters for Excellence (PCE) and the Archdiocese. The agreement is designed to increase cooperation among Philadelphia K-12 education providers, establish and share consistent academic metrics, and expand high-quality educational options available to students. The Great Schools Compact was awarded $2.5 million by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in December 2012 to improve teacher effectiveness, create an Urban Leadership Academy for District and Charter principals, and align benchmark assessments to the Common Core standard, a federal effort to define the knowledge and skills that students receive during their K-12 education careers so that they will graduate high school able to succeed in entry-level jobs, credit bearing academic college courses and in workforce training programs.[35]\n\n\n\n#### College access and success[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2008, Nutter re-constituted the Youth Council as the Philadelphia Council for College and Career Success – composed of leaders from government, K-12 and higher education, employers, foundations and youth-focused community organizations – to organize and lead education improvement efforts. The Mayor's office of Education also convenes the College Completion Committee which includes \"retention officers\" from area colleges and universities and senior leadership from the School District of Philadelphia.[35]\n\n\nThe Mayor's Office of Education is involved with cross-sector collaborations such as the College Prep Roundtable, and the Gates Millennium Scholarship Campaign. Examples of College Prep Roundtable programs include Philadelphia Academies, Inc., GEAR UP, Upward Bound, and College Access Centers. The two signature campaigns focus on issues related to college affordability, financial aid and FAFSA completion, and has resulted in a 21.7% increase in completed Free Applications for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) from 2008 through 2012. The Mayor's office also partners with the national Gates millennium Scholarship Program to offer orientation to competitive scholarship programs to high achieving seniors who commit to completing the application (which includes eight essays). In 2012, close to 500 applications were received, the second highest in the country, and five out of seven Pennsylvania recipients were Philadelphians.[35]\n\n\nIn February 2010, the city launched PhillyGoes2College, a program designed to help Philadelphians go to college. The effort includes a one-stop office in City Hall and a companion website that provides comprehensive guidance and referral information to students of any age who are interested in attending or completing college. Through workshops, school visits and large-scale college-promoting events, PhillyGoes2College has reached over 29,000 citizens since it opened in 2010, including 9,343 in FY13.[35]\n\n\nIn March 2011, the Graduation Coach Campaign was brought under the umbrella of PhillyGoes2College. The campaign focuses on engaging adults in taking on a more robust role in helping the young people in their lives graduate from high school, get into college, and plan for a career. Since September 2010, the campaign has trained over 4,300 Coaches through 315 workshops.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Other educational programs and initiatives[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2011, Nutter signed the Education Accountability Agreement to formalize a request for improved Information sharing and coordination between the city, Commonwealth and the School District of Philadelphia. Through the agreement, the City required the School District of Philadelphia to make data public on various expenditures, placed executive advisers from the state and city inside the School District of Philadelphia and required the School District of Philadelphia to develop and implement a Five-Year Plan.[35]\n\n\nThe Mayor's Returning to Learning Partnership allows City employees to pursue a college education by taking advantage of the tuition discount program offered by 13 area colleges and universities. Employees receive a 25% discount on tuition for each course for which they enroll and in some cases may also receive a full or partial scholarship to attend select institutions. The program is now housed in the city's \"Center of Excellence\".[35]\n\n\n\n### Other initiatives[edit]\n\n\n#### Philly311[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2008, Nutter launched the City of Philadelphia's first 311 service. Philly311 was implemented to provide the public with access to all city services and information. Residents can connect with Philly311 by telephone, email, mail, a walk-in center or through the Philly Mobile App. Philly311 has also extended its service through various social media channels. Since the beginning of 2012, Philly311 has seen a 360% increase in its social media followers.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mayor Nutter speaks with Secretary of State John Kerry.\n#### Sanctuary city status[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2014, Nutter signed an executive order largely ending the agreement that allowed the federal government to detain undocumented immigrants arrested in the city prior to release. The only exemption being if the individual is being released following a first or second degree felony conviction and federal officials obtain a warrant from a judge[37][38] - effectively making Philadelphia a sanctuary city.[39][40] Nutter indicated that the change in policy supports public safety and will help rebuild the trust between police and the immigrant community.[38] The executive order was highlighted in June 2014 after a previously deported undocumented immigrant from Honduras was accused of raping a woman in Rittenhouse Square with the concern that if acquitted, the accused would not be submitted for deportation due to Philadelphia's new policy.[41][42][43]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the largest 50 US cities\n* History of African Americans in Philadelphia\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"New Members Without Files Lame Ducks Cleaned Out Constituent Service Records\" Archived October 25, 2012, at the Wayback Machine, \"Philadelphia Daily News\", January 8, 2005, accessed August 6, 2011\n2. **^** \"Homeland Security Advisory Council Members\".

A member of the Democratic Party, he is also a former member of the Philadelphia City Council from the 4th district and had served as the 52nd Ward Democratic Leader until 1990.[1] Nutter also served as the President of the United States Conference of Mayors from 2012 to 2013, and is a former member of the Homeland Security Advisory Council.[2]\n\n\nCurrently, he is the David N. Dinkins Professor of Professional Practice in Urban and Public Affairs at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(August 2012)*\n |\n\n\nNutter was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up in West Philadelphia. Raised Catholic, he attended elementary school at Transfiguration of Our Lord Catholic Elementary School and later St. Joseph's Preparatory School in North Philadelphia.[4][5][6] He graduated from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1979 with a degree in business.[7] During his sophomore year in college, he started working as a DJ at Club Impulse in Philadelphia, where he was known as Mix Master Mike.[8] After graduating from college, Nutter began to work at Xerox, and then at an investment banking firm. While in office, Nutter occasionally worked as DJ and a singer.\n\n\nAs of 2014, Michael Nutter was a member of Mt. Carmel Baptist Church in West Philadelphia.[9]\n\n\n\n## Philadelphia City Council[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nNutter, then-leader of the 52nd ward of Philadelphia, initially challenged Democratic incumbent Ann Land for a seat on the Philadelphia City Council in 1987.[10] Though ultimately unsuccessful in his initial bid, Nutter defeated Land in a rematch four years later.[10]\n\n\nIn February 2003, Nutter was elected chairman of the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority Board.[11]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2002, Nutter introduced a measure requiring college students under 23 years old to register their address, license plate, car registration and insurance with their school, which would then put a sticker on that car as a \"student\" car, subjecting the student to triple the usual fines for traffic or parking tickets or any other offense. The ordinance also forced students in off-campus housing to inform their landlords of their student status.[12]\n\n\nIn September 2004, Nutter introduced legislation creating an independent Ethics Board; in addition, he proposed changes to the city's Ethics Code to provide for routine training and education of all city officers and employees, the issuance of advisory opinions, the adjudication of violations, and the imposition of civil fines. These measures were adopted at the end of 2005. On May 16, 2006, voters approved the Ethics Board ballot question with 81% voting to approve it, and was installed November 27, 2006.[13]\n\n\nNutter sponsored \"The Clean Indoor Air Worker Protection Law,\" expanding the definition of \"public places\" where smoking is not allowed to include restaurants and many bars, which Mayor Street eventually signed into law.[14] Nutter's local bidder preference program, which took effect on July 1, 2004, gives preference to Philadelphia businesses in competitive bidding on City contracts greater than $25,000.[14]\n\n\nIn January 2005, Philadelphia announced a library reorganization plan in which 20 branches would shift from full-day service to half-day service, and that many head librarians would be laid off. Library supporters rejected these changes and petitioned the Mayor and city council to restore service and staffing levels. The City Council rejected the Administration's cut, funding was restored, and by the fall of 2005 all library branches had full-day service, Saturday hours, and a head librarian. As mayor, Nutter sought to close eleven libraries until city council brought a suit that kept the libraries open.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHe supported having the City of Philadelphia declare a \"Crime Emergency\" in selected areas of Philadelphia.[15] This would have stationed more officers in certain areas of Philadelphia, limited the ability to gather on public sidewalks, imposed a curfew for all residents, and limited the ability to travel in certain areas. The proposal included a warrant-less police search technique known as \"stop and frisk.\"[16] Nutter claims that this approach is sufficiently similar to one that was found to be Constitutional by the United States Supreme Court in 1968 in *Terry v. Ohio*, but it still has not been determined if this specific exercise is in violation of Fourth Amendment rights.[17] A version of this plan was later implemented by Nutter and was the target of a lawsuit.[15]\n\n\nNutter has supported the eviction of the Cradle of Liberty Council of the Boy Scouts of America from their headquarters on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, both as a councilman and as mayor. In a televised debate on NBC 10 Live @ Issue he said, \"In my administration, we will not subsidize discrimination.\"[18] The Cradle of Liberty Council of the Boy Scouts of America eventually won their case.\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nutter campaigning in support of Barack Obama.\nMain articles: 2007 Philadelphia mayoral election and 2011 Philadelphia mayoral election\n\nNutter resigned from the city council in 2006 in order to focus on running for mayor the following year;[19] he later resigned as Chairman of the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority Board in April 2007.[20] In his mayoral campaign, he received endorsements from *The Philadelphia Inquirer*,[21] *Philadelphia Daily News*,[22] *Philadelphia* magazine,[23] *Northeast Times*,[24] *Philadelphia City Paper*,[25] *Philadelphia Weekly*,[26] *The Daily Pennsylvanian*,[27] Philly for Change,[28] the Penn Democrats,[29] and Clean Water Action.[30]\n\n\nNutter won the Democratic primary election on May 15 with 37% of the vote;[31] He then went on to win the general election on November 6, 2007, with 83% of the vote against Republican nominee Al Taubenberger's 13%.\n\n\nNutter announced that he would run for reelection on December 22, 2010.[32] He won the primary election against Milton Street with 76% of the vote,[33] and the general election with 75% of the vote.[34]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\n#### PhillyRising[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, Nutter commissioned a pilot project labeled \"Public Service Areas\" to supplement police response with a coordinated effort from other city agencies in areas of the city plagued with chronic issues of crime and disorder. After some initial signs of crime reduction in the Hartranft community of North Philadelphia, the pilot was renamed \"the PhillyRising Collaborative\" and expanded across each of the Philadelphia Police Department's six divisions. Each neighborhood selected for participation in PhillyRising is chosen based on an evaluation data regarding levels of crime, disorder, and other quality of life data.\n\n\nSince its inception in 2010, the PhillyRising Collaborative has supported crime reduction through improved quality of life in some of Philadelphia's most challenged communities. The team has supported active citizens with a variety of strategies, including the creation of three public computer labs (Hartranft, Frankford, & Kensington), and three Citizens' Engagement Academies (Hartranft, Swampoodle/Strawberry Mansion, & Point Breeze) which have produced 65 resident graduates. PhillyRising has also helped re-open the Hartranft Community Pool and brought the Police Athletic League to Hartranft Elementary School. These efforts, and many others, have helped to produce an average reduction of Part 1 Crimes by 4% and Part 2 Crimes by 9.5% after a full year of PhillyRising involvement in the pilot neighborhood. These reductions are significantly greater than those for the surrounding Police District.\n[35]\n\n\n\n#### RISE[edit]\n\n\nThrough Mayoral Executive Order, Nutter created the Mayor's Office of Reintegration Services for Ex-offenders (RISE) prioritizing the needs of returning citizens. Its mission emphasizes and formalizes the commitment of the Nutter Administration to promote safer communities and reduce law enforcement costs, assisting ex-offenders to be constructive individuals who contribute positively to our Philadelphia community, thereby reducing recidivism. As a City department, rather than a contract agency, RISE now has an ability to take lead/coordinator/partner role with grant funding solicitations. There are additional synergies and efficiencies created from the sharing of City resources. RISE has increased reentry activity levels despite a decrease in funding from $3.2 million to $1.4 million. The number of walk-in clients serviced has doubled (944 vs. 2339) and the number of clients enrolled in services has increased (531 vs. 731). In addition, there has been a 31% increase in number of clients employed (180 vs. 253).[35]\n\n\n\n#### Reducing youth violence[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Nutter joined forces with New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu to create Cities United, an initiative committed to reducing African-American male on African-American male violence. Cities United works to prevent violence in a collaborative effort among mayors, foundations, national nonprofits, federal agencies and youth, seeking to place African-American males who are victims and perpetrators of violence at the center of municipal agendas and develop recommendations for a national violence reduction strategy.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nutter speaks to the Knight Foundation in 2012.\nNutter also initiated the Youth Violence Reduction Partnership. The YVRP includes the City Probation & Parole, the Police and the Philadelphia Anti-Drug Anti Violence Network working in targeted police districts to identify youth at risk of becoming involved in crime and providing them support through access to employment, education, mentoring, health care and drug treatment.[35]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Nutter announced *Greenworks*, the city's plan to become the greenest city in America by 2015. *Greenworks* outlines 15 measurable targets and 166 initiatives in five topic areas: energy, environment, equity, economy, and engagement. As of June 21, 2013, 95% of the 166 initiatives were either complete or underway. Four years into the six-year implementation timeline, two-thirds of the targets show trends toward meeting established goals. Some specific highlights of current progress include: reduction of municipal energy use by 7 percent; alternative energy use increase from 2.5 to 14 percent; nearly 90,000 trees planted since 2008; City Council passage of energy bench-marking and disclosure legislation; and 11.6 new miles of trails completed since 2011.[35]\n\n\nIn 2012, Mayor Nutter signed Bill No. 120428 which amends the 'Energy Conservation' portion of the Philadelphia Code to require large commercial buildings to benchmark and report energy and water usage data to the city. The bill's purpose is not only to make organizations aware of their energy use, but also to identify opportunities for improvement and assist in establishing energy consumption baselines that will help set future goals.[35]\n\n\nNutter also implemented the city's first guaranteed energy-savings project at the city's four largest downtown office buildings. In 2011, Nutter began implementing nine energy-conservation measures in the city's largest downtown office buildings.[35]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Nutter established the Mayor's Office of Education to work on the related goals of increasing the high school graduation rate to 80 percent by 2015 and raising the rate of Philadelphia residents with a college degree to 36 percent by 2018. Currently, the on-time high school graduation rate is 64 percent and the percentage of residents with a 4-year college degree or higher is 24.3 percent. Since, 2007, the high school graduation rate has increased by 11 percentage points.[35]\n\n\n\n#### School funding[edit]\n\n\nThe city has increased its annual funding to public education by $155 million since July 2010. [35]\n\n\nOn September 11, 2013, Nutter launched the Philadelphia Education Supplies Fund, a new fundraising campaign to provide funds to schools within the city in order to purchase consumable supplemental classroom supplies, including workbooks, paper, pens, and pencils. This fund was created to alleviate some of the hardships being experienced by high-poverty schools. Under the stated criteria, schools with at least a 50% free and reduced price lunch population were eligible to apply, and those with more than 75% free and reduced-price lunches will receive greater amounts, in each case based on enrollment. The city has contributed $200,000 to the fund, and intends to do the same for at least five years. Over $540,000 was raised for the fund and 255 schools will receive funds, this includes 209 School District of Philadelphia schools, 20 charters, 13 Archdiocesan, and 13 independent/private.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Strengthening K-12 educational systems[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2011, the Great Schools Compact was signed by the city, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the SDP, the Pennsylvania Coalition of Public Charter Schools (PCPCS), the Philadelphia Charters for Excellence (PCE) and the Archdiocese. The agreement is designed to increase cooperation among Philadelphia K-12 education providers, establish and share consistent academic metrics, and expand high-quality educational options available to students. The Great Schools Compact was awarded $2.5 million by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in December 2012 to improve teacher effectiveness, create an Urban Leadership Academy for District and Charter principals, and align benchmark assessments to the Common Core standard, a federal effort to define the knowledge and skills that students receive during their K-12 education careers so that they will graduate high school able to succeed in entry-level jobs, credit bearing academic college courses and in workforce training programs.[35]\n\n\n\n#### College access and success[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2008, Nutter re-constituted the Youth Council as the Philadelphia Council for College and Career Success – composed of leaders from government, K-12 and higher education, employers, foundations and youth-focused community organizations – to organize and lead education improvement efforts. The Mayor's office of Education also convenes the College Completion Committee which includes \"retention officers\" from area colleges and universities and senior leadership from the School District of Philadelphia.[35]\n\n\nThe Mayor's Office of Education is involved with cross-sector collaborations such as the College Prep Roundtable, and the Gates Millennium Scholarship Campaign. Examples of College Prep Roundtable programs include Philadelphia Academies, Inc., GEAR UP, Upward Bound, and College Access Centers. The two signature campaigns focus on issues related to college affordability, financial aid and FAFSA completion, and has resulted in a 21.7% increase in completed Free Applications for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) from 2008 through 2012. The Mayor's office also partners with the national Gates millennium Scholarship Program to offer orientation to competitive scholarship programs to high achieving seniors who commit to completing the application (which includes eight essays). In 2012, close to 500 applications were received, the second highest in the country, and five out of seven Pennsylvania recipients were Philadelphians.[35]\n\n\nIn February 2010, the city launched PhillyGoes2College, a program designed to help Philadelphians go to college. The effort includes a one-stop office in City Hall and a companion website that provides comprehensive guidance and referral information to students of any age who are interested in attending or completing college. Through workshops, school visits and large-scale college-promoting events, PhillyGoes2College has reached over 29,000 citizens since it opened in 2010, including 9,343 in FY13.[35]\n\n\nIn March 2011, the Graduation Coach Campaign was brought under the umbrella of PhillyGoes2College. The campaign focuses on engaging adults in taking on a more robust role in helping the young people in their lives graduate from high school, get into college, and plan for a career. Since September 2010, the campaign has trained over 4,300 Coaches through 315 workshops.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Other educational programs and initiatives[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2011, Nutter signed the Education Accountability Agreement to formalize a request for improved Information sharing and coordination between the city, Commonwealth and the School District of Philadelphia. Through the agreement, the City required the School District of Philadelphia to make data public on various expenditures, placed executive advisers from the state and city inside the School District of Philadelphia and required the School District of Philadelphia to develop and implement a Five-Year Plan.[35]\n\n\nThe Mayor's Returning to Learning Partnership allows City employees to pursue a college education by taking advantage of the tuition discount program offered by 13 area colleges and universities. Employees receive a 25% discount on tuition for each course for which they enroll and in some cases may also receive a full or partial scholarship to attend select institutions. The program is now housed in the city's \"Center of Excellence\".[35]\n\n\n\n### Other initiatives[edit]\n\n\n#### Philly311[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2008, Nutter launched the City of Philadelphia's first 311 service. Philly311 was implemented to provide the public with access to all city services and information. Residents can connect with Philly311 by telephone, email, mail, a walk-in center or through the Philly Mobile App. Philly311 has also extended its service through various social media channels. Since the beginning of 2012, Philly311 has seen a 360% increase in its social media followers.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mayor Nutter speaks with Secretary of State John Kerry.\n#### Sanctuary city status[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2014, Nutter signed an executive order largely ending the agreement that allowed the federal government to detain undocumented immigrants arrested in the city prior to release. The only exemption being if the individual is being released following a first or second degree felony conviction and federal officials obtain a warrant from a judge[37][38] - effectively making Philadelphia a sanctuary city.[39][40] Nutter indicated that the change in policy supports public safety and will help rebuild the trust between police and the immigrant community.[38] The executive order was highlighted in June 2014 after a previously deported undocumented immigrant from Honduras was accused of raping a woman in Rittenhouse Square with the concern that if acquitted, the accused would not be submitted for deportation due to Philadelphia's new policy.[41][42][43]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the largest 50 US cities\n* History of African Americans in Philadelphia\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"New Members Without Files Lame Ducks Cleaned Out Constituent Service Records\" Archived October 25, 2012, at the Wayback Machine, \"Philadelphia Daily News\", January 8, 2005, accessed August 6, 2011\n2. **^** \"Homeland Security Advisory Council Members\".

He was first elected to a term beginning on January 3, 2000, and was re-elected to a second term beginning in 2004. He is a Democrat and became mayor after having served 19 years in the Philadelphia City Council, including seven years as its president, before resigning as required under the Philadelphia City Charter in order to run for mayor. He followed Ed Rendell as mayor, assuming the post on January 3, 2000. Street was Philadelphia's second black mayor.\n\n\nStreet floated the possibility of being a candidate for statewide office in Pennsylvania. In light of corruption scandals, those prospects never materialized. *Time Magazine* listed him as one of the three worst big-city mayors in the United States in 2005.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography and early career[edit]\n\n\nStreet was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and grew up as a member of a farming household. He graduated from Conshohocken High School, received a B.A. degree in English from Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama, and his J.D. degree from Temple University, which he had to apply to several times before he was accepted. Following his graduation from law school, Street served clerkships with Common Pleas Court Judge Mathew W. Bullock, Jr. and with the United States Department of Justice from which he was quickly terminated for poor performance. In his first professional job Street taught English at an elementary school and, later, at the Philadelphia Opportunities Industrialization Center (OIC). He then practiced law briefly prior to entering into public service. Street is married and has four children, including Sharif Street,[5] and is a practicing Seventh-day Adventist. His deceased brother, Milton, was a former member of the state legislature, and a two-time mayoral candidate.\n\n\nInspired by his brother's successful election in 1978, Street made his initial foray into elected politics in 1979, when he challenged incumbent Fifth District Councilman Cecil B. Moore. Moore was a popular and respected civil rights leader in the city who was active within the NAACP, and Street's decision to challenge him drew the ire of some. Moore, who was in failing health, initially sought to see-off the challenge from Street but died before the May primary. Street won the election, and quelled some of the tensions over his original challenge to Moore by sponsoring a bill to rename the former Columbia Avenue in Moore's honor.[6]\n\n\nStreet was chosen unanimously by members of the Council to serve as President in 1992, after incumbent Joe Coleman retired, and was re-elected in 1996. Street, working closely with former Mayor Ed Rendell, was instrumental in crafting and implementing a financial plan that passed Council unanimously, and turned a $250 million deficit into the largest surplus in city history. Despite decreasing the business and wage tax four years in a row, Philadelphia still has the 10th largest tax burden in the United States. This is due to the financial burden to run the city's prisons, pay debt service, and employee pensions and health benefits.[7]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 1999[edit]\n\n\nStreet was elected in one of the closest elections in Philadelphia history, defeating Republican Sam Katz by a margin of fewer than 7,500.[8]\n\n\nIn an unusual circumstance, the City Council President at the time, Anna Verna, was briefly in the position of running the city before Mayor Street was sworn in, as Rendell resigned the post in December 1999 to become the head of the DNC (per Article III, Chapter 5, Section 3-500 of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter).\nIn 2001, he was named runner up \"Politician of the Year\" by PoliticsPA.[9]\n\n\n\n#### 2003[edit]\n\n\nStreet was once again challenged by Sam Katz in the 2003 mayoral election. Despite an ongoing FBI investigation, Street was aided by Pennsylvania Governor and former Mayor of Philadelphia, Ed Rendell endorsing and campaigning for him.[10] He was named the 2003 Politician of the Year by the political website PoliticsPA, because \"It takes an extremely shrewd and effective politician to turn an FBI bugging of the mayor's office into a positive but that's exactly what Mayor John Street did.\"[11] Street won with 58% of the vote for reelection.[12]\n\n\nThe race was covered in the documentary film *The Shame of a City*.\n\n\n\n### Policy[edit]\n\n\nHis relationship with the City Council was tenuous at best. He and former councilman Michael Nutter, who became the 98th Mayor of Philadelphia, often engaged in public political sparring. Regardless, Street ultimately agreed to a 2005 revision of Nutter's New York-style smoking ban (after much public criticism over his failure to support a smoking ban in Philadelphia).\n\n\n\n![](image)John F. Street with President George W. Bush in Philadelphia during Independence Day in 2001\nDuring Street's first term, much emphasis was placed on the \"Neighborhood Transformation Initiative.\" The Neighborhood Transformation Initiative (NTI), which was unveiled in April 2001 was an unprecedented effort to counter the history of decline in the City of Philadelphia and revitalize its neighborhoods. The program was designed to revitalize and restore communities, to develop or restore quality housing, to clean and secure streets, and to create opportunities for vibrant cultural and recreational facilities.\n\n\nInitially, opponents raised objections to the program's emphasis on demolishing abandoned buildings rather than seeking re-use or restoration of the sometimes historic properties.[*citation needed*] Others hailed the program for bringing much-needed investment to the city's many poor neighborhoods.[*citation needed*] However, initial results have been positive. Since 2000, the average home in Philadelphia has appreciated[*when?*] by approximately 30 percent. The housing market continues to thrive, and developers have created more than 4,880 market-rate apartments and condominiums in the past several years.[*when?*][13]\n\n\nStreet also made children and their welfare a focus of his first term in office. In his first inaugural address in January 2000, Street officially proclaimed the year 2000 \"The Year of the Child\" in Philadelphia. He sought to increase funding for after-school programs, and formed the Philadelphia Children's Commission, a diverse group of government, civic, business, and faith-based leadership, whose job it was to advise Street on policies and programs that would have a positive impact in the lives of Philadelphia's children. He also sought to fight truancy among school aged children.[14][15]\n\n\nThe city's public schools were among the worst in the country when Street took office, and much of his attention early on went into difficult decisions about the schools. In November 2001, a compromise between Street and the Republican-controlled General Assembly allowed for the privatization of the Philadelphia Public Schools. Edison Schools took over day-to-day operations of some of the worst-performing city schools, while a small number were taken over by other institutions, primarily area universities.\n\n\nIn August 2001, the lucrative Philadelphia Parking Authority was taken over by the Pennsylvania government in a compromise designed to help the Philadelphia School District out of its fiscal crisis. Many believed that the Parking Authority's revenues were politically insubstantial in comparison with the high-profile patronage positions on the Parking Authority's board that were transferred from Democratic to Republican hands in the move.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mayor Street celebrating President George W. Bush's 55th birthday in Philadelphia.\nDrawing ire from skateboarders, he banned skateboarding from the internationally famous Love Park after the city had hosted the X-Games in 2001 and 2002 at the Wachovia Center. In 2004, he turned down a $1-million offer from DC Shoes to maintain and renovate the park to allow skating. Instead the city spent $800,000 on adding obstacles to prevent skaters from skating in the park.[16]\n\n\nStreet created the Office of Health and Fitness after the city was named the fattest city in the nation by *Men's Fitness* magazine in 1999. The magazine cited the low number of athletic facilities and high number of fast-food restaurants. Street also signed into law a smoking ban on September 12, 2006.\n\n\nStreet also advocated the construction of a citywide Wi-Fi network. The network is to be run by the non-profit organization Wireless Philadelphia in partnership with the city and commercial internet service providers. Opponents of the plan suggest that government involvement will quash innovation. Supporters hope that the plan will help bring information access to poor Philadelphians and make the city more attractive to young and educated people.\n\n\nIn a 2002 address at a convention of the NAACP, Street said that \"the brothers and sisters are running the city. Oh, yes. The brothers and sisters are running this city. Running it! Don't you let nobody fool you, we are in charge of the City of Brotherly Love. We are in charge! We are in charge!\" This observation attracted some criticism and charges of racial divisiveness.[17]\n\n\nThe murder rate in Philadelphia hit a seven-year high during Street's tenure, but the overall trend was significantly lower than in the 1970s under Frank Rizzo.[*citation needed*] In 2005 there were 380 murders, up from 330 in 2004. Forty-five percent of those murdered were 25 or younger. 2006 saw 406 murders in the city, including a Philadelphia police officer.[18] This murder trend continued to escalate into 2007, with 127 murders occurring by the end of April, 2007, a rate far in excess of the larger cities of New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago.[19] At least one commentator referred to Street as being \"strangely silent\" in his efforts to reduce the city's murder rate.[20]\n\n\nOn July 27, 2006, Street launched the Adolescent Violence Reduction Partnership (AVRP) as a way to prevent high risk youth (target age 10-15) from being victims of combat violence. He also expanded the Youth Violence Reduction Partnership (YVRP) into the 19th Police District in West Philadelphia.[21]\n\n\nOn September 12, 2007, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson, an African-American, supported by Street, called on \"10,000 black men\" to patrol the streets to lessen crime.[22] On Halloween Day, with the 2007 murder total above 335, a Philadelphia police officer was shot and killed for the second time in as many years (he was the third officer to be shot in a four-day period).\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### City Hall corruption scandal[edit]\n\n\nDuring the re-election campaign against Sam Katz, the FBI acknowledged that it had placed listening devices in the Mayor's office as part of a sweeping investigation of municipal corruption.[23] The FBI's investigation uncovered a corruption scheme led by Street's friend and fund raiser Ron White, who died before going to trial.[24] Former city treasurer Corey Kemp, a member of Street's administration, was sentenced to 10 years in jail after being found guilty on 27 corruption-related charges in May 2005.[25] Eventually at least 15 individuals connected to Street were convicted of crimes related to City Hall corruption.[26] One additional prosecution of members of Street's administration took place in the wake of the Kemp conviction and resulted in an acquittal of Mayoral Aide John D. Christmas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn September 2005, a prominent Muslim clergyman, Shamsud-din Ali, in Philadelphia was sentenced to more than seven years in prison on racketeering and other charges. Prosecutors said the cleric, who was once a member of Mayor John F. Street's transition team, used his political connections to obtain dubious loans, donations and city contracts. Ali was sentenced to 87 months in prison.[27] His conviction was affirmed on July 18, 2007, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (493 F.3d 387).\n\n\nLeonard Ross, a lawyer and close advisor of Mayor Street, who led a committee trying to develop a crucial piece of city-owned property, was charged with fraud and conspiracy in December 2005, and later pleaded guilty to the charges.[26]\n\n\nThe 2003 Philadelphia mayoral election was captured in the documentary film *The Shame of a City* by Tigre Hill, which gave viewers an inside look at the campaign and portrayed Street in a negative light.\n\n\nIn November 2006, federal authorities charged that Milton Street, Street's older brother, traded on his last name to obtain lucrative city contracts and failed to pay taxes on more than $2 million in income.[28] It was alleged that soon after Mayor Street took office in 2000, Milton Street began hiring himself out as consultant to companies that thought he could help them get city contracts.[*citation needed*] One company paid Milton Street $30,000 a month consulting fee.[*citation needed*] Milton Street was found guilty on tax charges.[28]\n\n\n\n### Boy Scout controversy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cradle of Liberty Council v. City of Philadelphia\n\nOn July 31, 2006, Mayor Street ordered the local Boy Scouts council, Cradle of Liberty Council, to admit gay scout leaders, vacate the city-owned building that it has occupied since 1928, or pay market rent.[29] Although the city subsidizes rental space for more than 75 community and activist organizations, including 14 other youth organizations and several religious groups that have restrictive membership policies, the Mayor took the position that the Boy Scouts were not in compliance with the city's anti-discrimination ordinance.[29] The Scouts argued that the city's action violated their right to freedom of assembly guaranteed under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The case ended with the court ruling in favor of the Boy Scouts of America.[30][31] The Cradle of Liberty Council was also awarded $877,000 for legal costs arising from the city's unlawful action.[32]\n\n\n\n## Post-mayoral career[edit]\n\n\nJohn Street's mayoral tenure ended on January 7, 2008. Upon leaving office, Street accepted an adjunct faculty position in the Temple University Department of Political Science. That spring, he taught two sections of a class on urban politics. Asked about his transition from public life to academia, the former mayor was quoted as saying, \"You know what? I think I'm really going to like it here!\"\n\n\nStreet was Chairman of the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) board when it came under criticism for poor oversight and mismanagement. The board was accused of improprieties in its legal spending, of failing to oversee president Carl R. Greene before he was fired from the agency, and of other ethical violations.[33][34][35] Control of the PHA was taken from the city of Philadelphia and given to Housing and Urban Development in 2011 to address these issues and was then returned to the city in 2013 under the direction of a new board.[33][34][35]\n\n\nIn 2011, he changed his voter registration from Democrat to Independent. Though Street maintained the switch was only, \"..a means of keeping a variety of options available as a matter of good politics...\", some had speculated that he intended to challenge incumbent Democratic Mayor Michael Nutter in the 2011 mayoral election.[36] He ultimately did not participate in the primary, and instead his brother, Milton Street challenged and lost to Mayor Nutter.[37]\n\n\n\n## Mayoral electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia mayoral election, 1999\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Democratic | John F.

He was first elected to a term beginning on January 3, 2000, and was re-elected to a second term beginning in 2004. He is a Democrat and became mayor after having served 19 years in the Philadelphia City Council, including seven years as its president, before resigning as required under the Philadelphia City Charter in order to run for mayor. He followed Ed Rendell as mayor, assuming the post on January 3, 2000. Street was Philadelphia's second black mayor.\n\n\nStreet floated the possibility of being a candidate for statewide office in Pennsylvania. In light of corruption scandals, those prospects never materialized. *Time Magazine* listed him as one of the three worst big-city mayors in the United States in 2005.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography and early career[edit]\n\n\nStreet was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and grew up as a member of a farming household. He graduated from Conshohocken High School, received a B.A. degree in English from Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama, and his J.D. degree from Temple University, which he had to apply to several times before he was accepted. Following his graduation from law school, Street served clerkships with Common Pleas Court Judge Mathew W. Bullock, Jr. and with the United States Department of Justice from which he was quickly terminated for poor performance. In his first professional job Street taught English at an elementary school and, later, at the Philadelphia Opportunities Industrialization Center (OIC). He then practiced law briefly prior to entering into public service. Street is married and has four children, including Sharif Street,[5] and is a practicing Seventh-day Adventist. His deceased brother, Milton, was a former member of the state legislature, and a two-time mayoral candidate.\n\n\nInspired by his brother's successful election in 1978, Street made his initial foray into elected politics in 1979, when he challenged incumbent Fifth District Councilman Cecil B. Moore. Moore was a popular and respected civil rights leader in the city who was active within the NAACP, and Street's decision to challenge him drew the ire of some. Moore, who was in failing health, initially sought to see-off the challenge from Street but died before the May primary. Street won the election, and quelled some of the tensions over his original challenge to Moore by sponsoring a bill to rename the former Columbia Avenue in Moore's honor.[6]\n\n\nStreet was chosen unanimously by members of the Council to serve as President in 1992, after incumbent Joe Coleman retired, and was re-elected in 1996. Street, working closely with former Mayor Ed Rendell, was instrumental in crafting and implementing a financial plan that passed Council unanimously, and turned a $250 million deficit into the largest surplus in city history. Despite decreasing the business and wage tax four years in a row, Philadelphia still has the 10th largest tax burden in the United States. This is due to the financial burden to run the city's prisons, pay debt service, and employee pensions and health benefits.[7]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 1999[edit]\n\n\nStreet was elected in one of the closest elections in Philadelphia history, defeating Republican Sam Katz by a margin of fewer than 7,500.[8]\n\n\nIn an unusual circumstance, the City Council President at the time, Anna Verna, was briefly in the position of running the city before Mayor Street was sworn in, as Rendell resigned the post in December 1999 to become the head of the DNC (per Article III, Chapter 5, Section 3-500 of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter).\nIn 2001, he was named runner up \"Politician of the Year\" by PoliticsPA.[9]\n\n\n\n#### 2003[edit]\n\n\nStreet was once again challenged by Sam Katz in the 2003 mayoral election. Despite an ongoing FBI investigation, Street was aided by Pennsylvania Governor and former Mayor of Philadelphia, Ed Rendell endorsing and campaigning for him.[10] He was named the 2003 Politician of the Year by the political website PoliticsPA, because \"It takes an extremely shrewd and effective politician to turn an FBI bugging of the mayor's office into a positive but that's exactly what Mayor John Street did.\"[11] Street won with 58% of the vote for reelection.[12]\n\n\nThe race was covered in the documentary film *The Shame of a City*.\n\n\n\n### Policy[edit]\n\n\nHis relationship with the City Council was tenuous at best. He and former councilman Michael Nutter, who became the 98th Mayor of Philadelphia, often engaged in public political sparring. Regardless, Street ultimately agreed to a 2005 revision of Nutter's New York-style smoking ban (after much public criticism over his failure to support a smoking ban in Philadelphia).\n\n\n\n![](image)John F. Street with President George W. Bush in Philadelphia during Independence Day in 2001\nDuring Street's first term, much emphasis was placed on the \"Neighborhood Transformation Initiative.\" The Neighborhood Transformation Initiative (NTI), which was unveiled in April 2001 was an unprecedented effort to counter the history of decline in the City of Philadelphia and revitalize its neighborhoods. The program was designed to revitalize and restore communities, to develop or restore quality housing, to clean and secure streets, and to create opportunities for vibrant cultural and recreational facilities.\n\n\nInitially, opponents raised objections to the program's emphasis on demolishing abandoned buildings rather than seeking re-use or restoration of the sometimes historic properties.[*citation needed*] Others hailed the program for bringing much-needed investment to the city's many poor neighborhoods.[*citation needed*] However, initial results have been positive. Since 2000, the average home in Philadelphia has appreciated[*when?*] by approximately 30 percent. The housing market continues to thrive, and developers have created more than 4,880 market-rate apartments and condominiums in the past several years.[*when?*][13]\n\n\nStreet also made children and their welfare a focus of his first term in office. In his first inaugural address in January 2000, Street officially proclaimed the year 2000 \"The Year of the Child\" in Philadelphia. He sought to increase funding for after-school programs, and formed the Philadelphia Children's Commission, a diverse group of government, civic, business, and faith-based leadership, whose job it was to advise Street on policies and programs that would have a positive impact in the lives of Philadelphia's children. He also sought to fight truancy among school aged children.[14][15]\n\n\nThe city's public schools were among the worst in the country when Street took office, and much of his attention early on went into difficult decisions about the schools. In November 2001, a compromise between Street and the Republican-controlled General Assembly allowed for the privatization of the Philadelphia Public Schools. Edison Schools took over day-to-day operations of some of the worst-performing city schools, while a small number were taken over by other institutions, primarily area universities.\n\n\nIn August 2001, the lucrative Philadelphia Parking Authority was taken over by the Pennsylvania government in a compromise designed to help the Philadelphia School District out of its fiscal crisis. Many believed that the Parking Authority's revenues were politically insubstantial in comparison with the high-profile patronage positions on the Parking Authority's board that were transferred from Democratic to Republican hands in the move.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mayor Street celebrating President George W. Bush's 55th birthday in Philadelphia.\nDrawing ire from skateboarders, he banned skateboarding from the internationally famous Love Park after the city had hosted the X-Games in 2001 and 2002 at the Wachovia Center. In 2004, he turned down a $1-million offer from DC Shoes to maintain and renovate the park to allow skating. Instead the city spent $800,000 on adding obstacles to prevent skaters from skating in the park.[16]\n\n\nStreet created the Office of Health and Fitness after the city was named the fattest city in the nation by *Men's Fitness* magazine in 1999. The magazine cited the low number of athletic facilities and high number of fast-food restaurants. Street also signed into law a smoking ban on September 12, 2006.\n\n\nStreet also advocated the construction of a citywide Wi-Fi network. The network is to be run by the non-profit organization Wireless Philadelphia in partnership with the city and commercial internet service providers. Opponents of the plan suggest that government involvement will quash innovation. Supporters hope that the plan will help bring information access to poor Philadelphians and make the city more attractive to young and educated people.\n\n\nIn a 2002 address at a convention of the NAACP, Street said that \"the brothers and sisters are running the city. Oh, yes. The brothers and sisters are running this city. Running it! Don't you let nobody fool you, we are in charge of the City of Brotherly Love. We are in charge! We are in charge!\" This observation attracted some criticism and charges of racial divisiveness.[17]\n\n\nThe murder rate in Philadelphia hit a seven-year high during Street's tenure, but the overall trend was significantly lower than in the 1970s under Frank Rizzo.[*citation needed*] In 2005 there were 380 murders, up from 330 in 2004. Forty-five percent of those murdered were 25 or younger. 2006 saw 406 murders in the city, including a Philadelphia police officer.[18] This murder trend continued to escalate into 2007, with 127 murders occurring by the end of April, 2007, a rate far in excess of the larger cities of New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago.[19] At least one commentator referred to Street as being \"strangely silent\" in his efforts to reduce the city's murder rate.[20]\n\n\nOn July 27, 2006, Street launched the Adolescent Violence Reduction Partnership (AVRP) as a way to prevent high risk youth (target age 10-15) from being victims of combat violence. He also expanded the Youth Violence Reduction Partnership (YVRP) into the 19th Police District in West Philadelphia.[21]\n\n\nOn September 12, 2007, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson, an African-American, supported by Street, called on \"10,000 black men\" to patrol the streets to lessen crime.[22] On Halloween Day, with the 2007 murder total above 335, a Philadelphia police officer was shot and killed for the second time in as many years (he was the third officer to be shot in a four-day period).\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### City Hall corruption scandal[edit]\n\n\nDuring the re-election campaign against Sam Katz, the FBI acknowledged that it had placed listening devices in the Mayor's office as part of a sweeping investigation of municipal corruption.[23] The FBI's investigation uncovered a corruption scheme led by Street's friend and fund raiser Ron White, who died before going to trial.[24] Former city treasurer Corey Kemp, a member of Street's administration, was sentenced to 10 years in jail after being found guilty on 27 corruption-related charges in May 2005.[25] Eventually at least 15 individuals connected to Street were convicted of crimes related to City Hall corruption.[26] One additional prosecution of members of Street's administration took place in the wake of the Kemp conviction and resulted in an acquittal of Mayoral Aide John D. Christmas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn September 2005, a prominent Muslim clergyman, Shamsud-din Ali, in Philadelphia was sentenced to more than seven years in prison on racketeering and other charges. Prosecutors said the cleric, who was once a member of Mayor John F. Street's transition team, used his political connections to obtain dubious loans, donations and city contracts. Ali was sentenced to 87 months in prison.[27] His conviction was affirmed on July 18, 2007, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (493 F.3d 387).\n\n\nLeonard Ross, a lawyer and close advisor of Mayor Street, who led a committee trying to develop a crucial piece of city-owned property, was charged with fraud and conspiracy in December 2005, and later pleaded guilty to the charges.[26]\n\n\nThe 2003 Philadelphia mayoral election was captured in the documentary film *The Shame of a City* by Tigre Hill, which gave viewers an inside look at the campaign and portrayed Street in a negative light.\n\n\nIn November 2006, federal authorities charged that Milton Street, Street's older brother, traded on his last name to obtain lucrative city contracts and failed to pay taxes on more than $2 million in income.[28] It was alleged that soon after Mayor Street took office in 2000, Milton Street began hiring himself out as consultant to companies that thought he could help them get city contracts.[*citation needed*] One company paid Milton Street $30,000 a month consulting fee.[*citation needed*] Milton Street was found guilty on tax charges.[28]\n\n\n\n### Boy Scout controversy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cradle of Liberty Council v. City of Philadelphia\n\nOn July 31, 2006, Mayor Street ordered the local Boy Scouts council, Cradle of Liberty Council, to admit gay scout leaders, vacate the city-owned building that it has occupied since 1928, or pay market rent.[29] Although the city subsidizes rental space for more than 75 community and activist organizations, including 14 other youth organizations and several religious groups that have restrictive membership policies, the Mayor took the position that the Boy Scouts were not in compliance with the city's anti-discrimination ordinance.[29] The Scouts argued that the city's action violated their right to freedom of assembly guaranteed under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The case ended with the court ruling in favor of the Boy Scouts of America.[30][31] The Cradle of Liberty Council was also awarded $877,000 for legal costs arising from the city's unlawful action.[32]\n\n\n\n## Post-mayoral career[edit]\n\n\nJohn Street's mayoral tenure ended on January 7, 2008. Upon leaving office, Street accepted an adjunct faculty position in the Temple University Department of Political Science. That spring, he taught two sections of a class on urban politics. Asked about his transition from public life to academia, the former mayor was quoted as saying, \"You know what? I think I'm really going to like it here!\"\n\n\nStreet was Chairman of the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) board when it came under criticism for poor oversight and mismanagement. The board was accused of improprieties in its legal spending, of failing to oversee president Carl R. Greene before he was fired from the agency, and of other ethical violations.[33][34][35] Control of the PHA was taken from the city of Philadelphia and given to Housing and Urban Development in 2011 to address these issues and was then returned to the city in 2013 under the direction of a new board.[33][34][35]\n\n\nIn 2011, he changed his voter registration from Democrat to Independent. Though Street maintained the switch was only, \"..a means of keeping a variety of options available as a matter of good politics...\", some had speculated that he intended to challenge incumbent Democratic Mayor Michael Nutter in the 2011 mayoral election.[36] He ultimately did not participate in the primary, and instead his brother, Milton Street challenged and lost to Mayor Nutter.[37]\n\n\n\n## Mayoral electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia mayoral election, 1999\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Democratic | John F.

He served from 1984 to 1992, a period which included the controversial MOVE police action and house bombing in 1985. Goode was also a community activist, chair of the state Public Utility Commission, and managing director for the City of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nGoode was born into a family of tenant farmers near Seaboard, North Carolina.[1] His family arrived in Philadelphia in 1953 and lived in the Paschall neighborhood in Southwest Philadelphia. He was an honors student at John Bartram High School and then he graduated from Morgan State University in 1961. He was a member of the Reserve Officers Training Corps while attending Morgan State and entered the US Army as a First Lieutenant in the military police. He returned to Philadelphia and briefly worked as a manager at a building maintenance firm and as an insurance adjuster before he was hired by the Philadelphia Council for Community Development in 1967. He became executive director of PCCD in 1971. In 1967 he and his wife bought a house in the Paschall neighborhood, where he served as a deacon of Paschall's First Baptist Church. In 1968, he completed his graduate studies at the Fels Institute of Government at the University of Pennsylvania where he earned his master's in Public Administration.[2]\n\n\n\n## Service with the Public Utility Commission[edit]\n\n\nAfter African-American state senators complained that there had never been an African-American member of the state Public Utility Commission (PUC), Governor Milton Shapp began actively searching for one. His aide, Terry Dellmuth, knew Goode from his community and political activities and recommended him.\n\n\nAs a PUC commissioner, Goode met with community groups around the state, studied relevant issues, compiled what was seen as a pro-consumer record, and forged good working relations with his fellow commissioners. He was soon elevated to the chairmanship of the PUC, where he continued his pro-consumer policies but worked to limit PUC expenditures.\n\n\n\n## Work in the Office of the Mayor[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Bill Green, who had been elected in November 1979, had promised to appoint a black managing director after winning a racially divisive Democratic primary against former deputy mayor Charles Bowser. Green kept his promise by appointing Goode as managing director at the urging of key members of the black community. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\nBefore the primary election of 1983, Green decided not to seek reelection. Goode jumped into the race and defeated former Mayor Frank Rizzo in a racially polarized primary election. Goode went on to win the general election over former Green fund-raiser and Philadelphia Stock Exchange Chairman John Egan, the Republican Party nominee.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGoode's tenure as mayor was marred in 1985 by the MOVE Bombing, in which police attempted to clear a building in West Philadelphia inhabited by MOVE, a radical back-to-nature group, whose members, under the leadership of founder John Africa, had long defied city officials by yelling slogans and statements from a megaphone, ignoring city sanitation codes, assaulting neighbors, and resisting law enforcement officers.[3] During the attempt to evacuate the compound, police used tear gas, leading to members of MOVE opening fire on them. During the final assault on the building, the police dropped an improvised bomb made of C-4 plastic explosive and Tovex, an explosive gel used in underwater mining, onto to a bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the building. This caused the house to catch fire, and ignited a massive blaze which eventually consumed almost 4 city blocks, killed 11 people, and left 240 people homeless.[4]\n\n\nIn 1987 Goode ran for reelection, winning the Democratic primary before facing off in the general election against former mayor Frank Rizzo, who had converted to the Republican Party after losing the 1983 Democratic primary to Goode. Goode defeated Rizzo 51%-49% to earn a second term.\n\n\n\n## Post-mayoral life[edit]\n\n\nGoode stayed active after leaving office as mayor by holding a position in the U.S. Department of Education. He earned a Doctor of Ministry at Palmer Theological Seminary,[5] and became a minister and professor at Eastern University, as well as a leader of advocacy for faith-based initiatives. He currently serves as CEO of Amachi, a mentoring program for children of incarcerated parents. He was awarded the Purpose Prize, a $100,000 award given to exceptional individuals over age 60 who are working to address critical social problems.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Holst, Arthur Matthew (2013). \"Goode, W.

Goode defeated Rizzo 51%-49% to earn a second term.\n\n\n\n## Post-mayoral life[edit]\n\n\nGoode stayed active after leaving office as mayor by holding a position in the U.S. Department of Education. He earned a Doctor of Ministry at Palmer Theological Seminary,[5] and became a minister and professor at Eastern University, as well as a leader of advocacy for faith-based initiatives. He currently serves as CEO of Amachi, a mentoring program for children of incarcerated parents. He was awarded the Purpose Prize, a $100,000 award given to exceptional individuals over age 60 who are working to address critical social problems.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Holst, Arthur Matthew (2013). \"Goode, W.
