The *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing songs in the US. Its data is compiled by Luminate Data and published by American music magazine *Billboard*. The chart is based on each song's weekly physical and digital sales collectively, the amount of airplay it receives on American radio stations, and its audio and video streams on online digital music platforms.\n\n\n\"As It Was\", the lead single from English singer Harry Styles' third studio album *Harry's House* (2022), debuted atop the Hot 100 and spent 15 weeks at the top spot—the most for any song in 2022, and the longest reigning number-one song by a soloist in the 64-year history of the chart, surpassing \"Candle in the Wind\" (1997) by Elton John, \"I Will Always Love You\" (1992) by Whitney Houston, and \"We Belong Together\" (2005) by Mariah Carey.[1] \"Heat Waves\" (2020) by English indie pop band Glass Animals topped the *Billboard* Year-End Hot 100,[2] after reaching number-one on the weekly charts in its 59th week, breaking the record for the longest journey to number one, surpassing the 35-week tally of Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" (1994).[3] With 91 total weeks on the chart, the song dethroned The Weeknd's \"Blinding Lights\" (2020) as the longest-charting song in Hot 100 history.[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Anti-Hero\" by Taylor Swift is 2022's best-selling song and longest-reigning chart-topper by a female artist.\"Anti-Hero\", the lead single from American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's tenth studio album *Midnights* (2022), was the best-selling song of 2022.[5] It sold 327,000 digital downloads in its third week on the Hot 100, garnering the biggest sales week for a song in over five years, since Swift’s own \"Look What You Made Me Do\" (2017) sold 353,000 copies in its first week.[6] \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" (2021) by Carolina Gaitán, Mauro Castillo, Adassa, Rhenzy Feliz, Diane Guerrero, Stephanie Beatriz and the cast of *Encanto* broke the all-time Hot 100 record for the most credited artists on a number-one song (seven). It is the second chart-topper from a Disney animated film, after \"A Whole New World\" by Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle from *Aladdin* (1992),[7] and the studio's only song that spent five weeks at number one.[8] English singer Sam Smith and German singer Kim Petras became the first publicly non-binary and transgender artists, respectively, to top the Hot 100, after their 2022 single \"Unholy\" rose to the number-one spot.[9]\n\n\nTwenty-three acts have reached number one in 2022, with twelve—Gaitán, Castillo, Adassa, Feliz, Guerrero, Beatriz, the *Encanto* cast, Glass Animals, Tems, Steve Lacy, Smith and Petras—reaching the top spot for the first time. Canadian rapper Drake is the only act to have garnered two number-one songs this year, with his 2022 singles \"Wait for U\" and \"Jimmy Cooks\".\n\n\n\n\n## Chart history[edit]\n\n\n![Glass Animals performing in 2014](image)\"Heat Waves\", the 2020 single by British indie-pop band Glass Animals, topped the Hot 100 in 2022 for five weeks.

The *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing songs in the US. Its data is compiled by Luminate Data and published by American music magazine *Billboard*. The chart is based on each song's weekly physical and digital sales collectively, the amount of airplay it receives on American radio stations, and its audio and video streams on online digital music platforms.\n\n\n\"As It Was\", the lead single from English singer Harry Styles' third studio album *Harry's House* (2022), debuted atop the Hot 100 and spent 15 weeks at the top spot—the most for any song in 2022, and the longest reigning number-one song by a soloist in the 64-year history of the chart, surpassing \"Candle in the Wind\" (1997) by Elton John, \"I Will Always Love You\" (1992) by Whitney Houston, and \"We Belong Together\" (2005) by Mariah Carey.[1] \"Heat Waves\" (2020) by English indie pop band Glass Animals topped the *Billboard* Year-End Hot 100,[2] after reaching number-one on the weekly charts in its 59th week, breaking the record for the longest journey to number one, surpassing the 35-week tally of Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" (1994).[3] With 91 total weeks on the chart, the song dethroned The Weeknd's \"Blinding Lights\" (2020) as the longest-charting song in Hot 100 history.[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Anti-Hero\" by Taylor Swift is 2022's best-selling song and longest-reigning chart-topper by a female artist.\"Anti-Hero\", the lead single from American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's tenth studio album *Midnights* (2022), was the best-selling song of 2022.[5] It sold 327,000 digital downloads in its third week on the Hot 100, garnering the biggest sales week for a song in over five years, since Swift’s own \"Look What You Made Me Do\" (2017) sold 353,000 copies in its first week.[6] \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" (2021) by Carolina Gaitán, Mauro Castillo, Adassa, Rhenzy Feliz, Diane Guerrero, Stephanie Beatriz and the cast of *Encanto* broke the all-time Hot 100 record for the most credited artists on a number-one song (seven). It is the second chart-topper from a Disney animated film, after \"A Whole New World\" by Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle from *Aladdin* (1992),[7] and the studio's only song that spent five weeks at number one.[8] English singer Sam Smith and German singer Kim Petras became the first publicly non-binary and transgender artists, respectively, to top the Hot 100, after their 2022 single \"Unholy\" rose to the number-one spot.[9]\n\n\nTwenty-three acts have reached number one in 2022, with twelve—Gaitán, Castillo, Adassa, Feliz, Guerrero, Beatriz, the *Encanto* cast, Glass Animals, Tems, Steve Lacy, Smith and Petras—reaching the top spot for the first time. Canadian rapper Drake is the only act to have garnered two number-one songs this year, with his 2022 singles \"Wait for U\" and \"Jimmy Cooks\".\n\n\n\n\n## Chart history[edit]\n\n\n![Glass Animals performing in 2014](image)\"Heat Waves\", the 2020 single by British indie-pop band Glass Animals, topped the Hot 100 in 2022 for five weeks. It became the best-charting song of the year.\n![Miranda at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con International in San Diego, California.](image)American singer-songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\", the first song from a Disney animated film to top the Hot 100 for multiple weeks, spending five weeks at the top.\n![](image)Mariah Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" (1994) returned to spend five weeks atop the chart in 2022.\n\n\nKey\n| †\n | Indicates best-performing song of 2022[2] |\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Issue date\n | Song\n | Artist(s)\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| re\n | January 1\n | \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\"\n | Mariah Carey | [10][11] |\n| January 8\n | [12][13] |\n| re\n | January 15\n | \"Easy on Me\"\n | Adele | [14][15] |\n| January 22\n | [16][17] |\n| January 29\n | [18][19] |\n| 1133\n | February 5\n | \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\"\n | Carolina Gaitán, Mauro Castillo, Adassa,Rhenzy Feliz, Diane Guerrero, Stephanie Beatrizand the *Encanto* cast\n | [20][7] |\n| February 12\n | [21][22] |\n| February 19\n | [23][24] |\n| February 26\n | [25][26] |\n| March 5\n | [27][8] |\n| 1134\n | March 12\n | \"Heat Waves\" †\n | Glass Animals | [28][3] |\n| March 19\n | [29][30] |\n| March 26\n | [31][32] |\n| April 2\n | [33][34] |\n| April 9\n | [35][36] |\n| 1135\n | April 16\n | \"As It Was\"\n | Harry Styles | [37][38] |\n| 1136\n | April 23\n | \"First Class\"\n | Jack Harlow | [39][40] |\n| re\n | April 30\n | \"As It Was\"\n | Harry Styles\n | [41][42] |\n| May 7\n | [43][44] |\n| 1137\n | May 14\n | \"Wait for U\"\n | Future featuring Drake and Tems | [45][46] |\n| re\n | May 21\n | \"First Class\"\n | Jack Harlow\n | [47][48] |\n| May 28\n | [49][50] |\n| re\n | June 4\n | \"As It Was\"\n | Harry Styles\n | [51][52] |\n| June 11\n | [53][54] |\n| June 18\n | [55][56] |\n| June 25\n | [57][58] |\n| 1138\n | July 2\n | \"Jimmy Cooks\"\n | Drake featuring 21 Savage | [59][60] |\n| re\n | July 9\n | \"As It Was\"\n | Harry Styles\n | [61][62] |\n| July 16\n | [63][64] |\n| July 23\n | [65][66] |\n| 1139\n | July 30\n | \"About Damn Time\"\n | Lizzo | [67][68] |\n| August 6\n | [69][70] |\n| 1140\n | August 13\n | \"Break My Soul\"\n | Beyoncé | [71][72] |\n| August 20\n | [73][74] |\n| 1141\n | August 27\n | \"Super Freaky Girl\"\n | Nicki Minaj | [75][76] |\n| re\n | September 3\n | \"As It Was\"\n | Harry Styles\n | [77][78] |\n| September 10\n | [79][80] |\n| September 17\n | [81][82] |\n| September 24\n | [83][84] |\n| October 1\n | [85][1] |\n| 1142\n | October 8\n | \"Bad Habit\"\n | Steve Lacy | [86][87] |\n| October 15\n | [88][89] |\n| October 22\n | [90][91] |\n| 1143\n | October 29\n | \"Unholy\"\n | Sam Smith and Kim Petras | [92][9] |\n| 1144\n | November 5\n | \"Anti-Hero\"\n | Taylor Swift | [93][94] |\n| November 12\n | [95][96] |\n| November 19\n | [97][6] |\n| November 26\n | [98][99] |\n| December 3\n | [100][101] |\n| December 10\n | [102][103] |\n| re\n | December 17\n | \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\"\n | Mariah Carey\n | [104][105] |\n| December 24\n | [106][107] |\n| December 31\n | [108][109] |\n\n\n## Number-one artists[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of number-one artists by total weeks at number one\n| Position\n | Artist\n | Weeks at No. 1\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Harry Styles\n | 15\n |\n| 2\n | Taylor Swift\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | Carolina Gaitán\n | 5\n |\n| Mauro Castillo\n |\n| Adassa\n |\n| Rhenzy Feliz\n |\n| Diane Guerrero\n |\n| Stephanie Beatriz\n |\n| *Encanto* cast\n |\n| Glass Animals\n |\n| Mariah Carey\n |\n| 12\n | Adele\n | 3\n |\n| Jack Harlow\n |\n| Steve Lacy\n |\n| 15\n | Drake\n | 2\n |\n| Lizzo\n |\n| Beyoncé\n |\n| 18\n | Future\n | 1\n |\n| Tems\n |\n| 21 Savage\n |\n| Nicki Minaj\n |\n| Sam Smith\n |\n| Kim Petras\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of *Billboard* 200 number-one albums of 2022\n* List of *Billboard* Global 200 number ones of 2022\n* List of *Billboard* Hot 100 top-ten singles in 2022\n* *Billboard* Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2022\n* 2022 in American music\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Trust, Gary (September 26, 2022). \"Harry Styles' 'As It Was' Tops Hot 100 for 15th Week – Longest Reign Ever for a British Act\". *Billboard*.

A sleeper hit, it is the band's signature song and biggest hit single to date. In addition to reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart and being a top-five hit in several other European countries, it reached number one in Australia, Canada, Lithuania, Switzerland and the United States, where it topped the *Billboard* Hot 100 for five weeks in early 2022 after a record-breaking 59-week climb to number one. At 91 weeks, it is the longest charting song on the Hot 100 of all time, surpassing \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd.[4] By September 2022, the song had accumulated more than two billion streams on Spotify.[5] At the 2022 Brit Awards, \"Heat Waves\" was nominated for Best British Single.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Composition and other versions[edit]\n\n\nBayley stated that \"Heat Waves\" \"is about loss and longing, and ultimately realising you are unable to save something\".[7] He said that \"Also, this song is about memories and it's very nostalgic, and sometimes people feel more of that in the winter. Maybe that's part of the reason this song's hung around for so bloody long – everyone's locked inside and trapped in their own thoughts.\"[8]\n\n\n\"Heat Waves\" starts on a high and then drops into despair before rising again for a cheerful, optimistic finale, much like the crests and troughs of a real wave. Bayley came up with the chords one day while playing around on the guitar. He wrote the lyrics in just an hour, prompted by the death of a close friend whose birthday was in June.[8]\n\n\nIn March 2021, the podcast Song Exploder featured an interview with Dave Bayley that specifically discussed the creation of \"Heat Waves\". He says \"weirdly, Johnny Depp was the first person to hear this song.\" In it, he says that after writing/performing the song late at night alone in the studio, he decided to go home when he realized a stranger was sitting behind him. It was Depp who had been working in another studio.[9]\n\n\n\"Heat Waves\" is an example of *Dreamland*'s incorporation of hip hop and electropop elements into Glass Animals' sound. It and \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" rejects the band's acoustic percussion and marimbas in favor of 808 sounds and skittering hi-hats.[10] *NME*'s Hannah Mylrea categorized the song as \"earnest R&B run through the Glass Animals filter\", and *Pitchfork*'s Ian Cohen argued its guitars \"could be plucked from any number of 'wavy hip-hop' sample packs meant to emulate Frank Ocean's 'Ivy' on a bedroom producer's budget\".[11][12] A major theme on *Dreamland* is the pursuit of brief pleasures to cope with the hardships of life, such as lust for others. On \"Heat Waves\", Bayley sings repeatedly, \"Sometimes all I think about is you/Late nights in the middle of June.\"[10]\n\n\nThe band ran a remix competition for the track, with 19-year-old British producer Shakur Ahmad winning and having his remix issued by the band, alongside a remix by American DJ Diplo in August 2020.[13] Another remix is a collaboration with American rapper Iann Dior. A piano Simlish version was recorded by Bayley for *The Sims 4*, and was featured in a limited-time \"Sims Sessions\" in-game music event in 2021.[14]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\"Heat Waves\" was met with positive reviews upon release, with music critics such as Robin Murray, Owen Richards, and Rob Waters praising the song as a \"stunningly effective\" pop track, \"built on a delicious groove and utilising very conventional lyrical structures\" while containing enough elements unique to Glass Animals to entice more listeners to them.[15][16][17] *No Ripcord*'s Ethan Gordon generally found *Dreamland* \"as momentarily annoying as it is infinitely forgettable\" due to its combination of trap percussion and synthesizers being mostly \"strained and unpleasant\"; however, he considered \"Heat Waves\" to be the \"strongest\" mixture of those sounds.[18]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\nA sleeper hit, \"Heat Waves\" is the group's most successful single to date. It was voted into first place on the Australian Triple J Hottest 100 of 2020, making Glass Animals the first British act to top the countdown since Mumford & Sons won the 2009 poll with \"Little Lion Man\". It then spent seven weeks at the top of the Australian ARIA Singles Chart and was later certified as the number one song for 2021 in Australia. It reached No. 1 in March 2021, stayed there until April 2021, and returned to that position in March 2022.[19] It is the first song ever to stay in the Australian top 10 for more than a year, staying there for 85 weeks. It also reached the top 20 in several territories.\n\n\nIn the United States, \"Heat Waves\" peaked at number one on the *Billboard* Hot 100 chart dated 12 March 2022, completing a record-breaking 59-week climb to the position.[20] It dethroned *Encanto*'s \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" after five consecutive weeks at number one. \"Heat Waves\" previously reached number 10 on the Hot 100 in its 42nd week on the chart, breaking the record for the longest climb to the top 10, surpassing Carrie Underwood's \"Before He Cheats\" (2007).[21] The song also reached the top five in its 51st week on the chart, breaking the record previously set by Gabby Barrett's \"I Hope\" (2020).[22] The song was in the top 10 up to its 80th week on the chart. No other song in the chart's history has reached such longevity.[23][24] This longevity has been attributed to, among other things, a popular fan fiction[25] which shipped Dream and GeorgeNotFound, two YouTubers who play *Minecraft*.[24][26]\n\n\nOn the UK Singles Chart the single originally peaked at number 19 in the first half of 2021. After its inclusion in the EA Sports video game *FIFA 21* and wide usage as backing music in various TikTok videos, the song re-entered at number 18 in September 2021 and continued to climb into the top 5.[27][28][29] The viral video also helped the song climb back up 31 places to number 14 on the Irish Singles Chart in its 41st week on the chart, before peaking at number 5. The track has spent a total of 22 weeks in the top 10 to date, the most among tracks in 2021.[30] The song reached number one on the *Billboard* Global 200 in the issue dated 5 March 2022,[31] and also reached the same peak on the Global Excl. US chart.[32]\n\n\n\n## Music videos[edit]\n\n\nA lyric video heavily based on the vaporwave imagery was released through Glass Animals official YouTube account on 20 July 2020. The video was produced by designer Notnarcs. It gained almost 30 million views during its first year on YouTube. As of June 2023, the lyric video on YouTube has amassed over 126 million views.\n\n\nThe official music video for the song, directed by Colin Read, premiered on 29 June 2020. It shows frontman Dave Bayley walking through the streets of East London[33] pulling a wagon stacked with several TVs, filmed by his neighbours using their phones during the COVID-19 lockdowns, before arriving at a venue, setting the TVs up on a stage that then display his bandmates playing their instruments, and singing the rest of the song. Bayley called it \"a love letter to live music and the culture and togetherness surrounding it\".[34] As of August 2023, the music video has amassed over 600 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n\n## Track

A sleeper hit, it is the band's signature song and biggest hit single to date. In addition to reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart and being a top-five hit in several other European countries, it reached number one in Australia, Canada, Lithuania, Switzerland and the United States, where it topped the *Billboard* Hot 100 for five weeks in early 2022 after a record-breaking 59-week climb to number one. At 91 weeks, it is the longest charting song on the Hot 100 of all time, surpassing \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd.[4] By September 2022, the song had accumulated more than two billion streams on Spotify.[5] At the 2022 Brit Awards, \"Heat Waves\" was nominated for Best British Single.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Composition and other versions[edit]\n\n\nBayley stated that \"Heat Waves\" \"is about loss and longing, and ultimately realising you are unable to save something\".[7] He said that \"Also, this song is about memories and it's very nostalgic, and sometimes people feel more of that in the winter. Maybe that's part of the reason this song's hung around for so bloody long – everyone's locked inside and trapped in their own thoughts.\"[8]\n\n\n\"Heat Waves\" starts on a high and then drops into despair before rising again for a cheerful, optimistic finale, much like the crests and troughs of a real wave. Bayley came up with the chords one day while playing around on the guitar. He wrote the lyrics in just an hour, prompted by the death of a close friend whose birthday was in June.[8]\n\n\nIn March 2021, the podcast Song Exploder featured an interview with Dave Bayley that specifically discussed the creation of \"Heat Waves\". He says \"weirdly, Johnny Depp was the first person to hear this song.\" In it, he says that after writing/performing the song late at night alone in the studio, he decided to go home when he realized a stranger was sitting behind him. It was Depp who had been working in another studio.[9]\n\n\n\"Heat Waves\" is an example of *Dreamland*'s incorporation of hip hop and electropop elements into Glass Animals' sound. It and \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" rejects the band's acoustic percussion and marimbas in favor of 808 sounds and skittering hi-hats.[10] *NME*'s Hannah Mylrea categorized the song as \"earnest R&B run through the Glass Animals filter\", and *Pitchfork*'s Ian Cohen argued its guitars \"could be plucked from any number of 'wavy hip-hop' sample packs meant to emulate Frank Ocean's 'Ivy' on a bedroom producer's budget\".[11][12] A major theme on *Dreamland* is the pursuit of brief pleasures to cope with the hardships of life, such as lust for others. On \"Heat Waves\", Bayley sings repeatedly, \"Sometimes all I think about is you/Late nights in the middle of June.\"[10]\n\n\nThe band ran a remix competition for the track, with 19-year-old British producer Shakur Ahmad winning and having his remix issued by the band, alongside a remix by American DJ Diplo in August 2020.[13] Another remix is a collaboration with American rapper Iann Dior. A piano Simlish version was recorded by Bayley for *The Sims 4*, and was featured in a limited-time \"Sims Sessions\" in-game music event in 2021.[14]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\"Heat Waves\" was met with positive reviews upon release, with music critics such as Robin Murray, Owen Richards, and Rob Waters praising the song as a \"stunningly effective\" pop track, \"built on a delicious groove and utilising very conventional lyrical structures\" while containing enough elements unique to Glass Animals to entice more listeners to them.[15][16][17] *No Ripcord*'s Ethan Gordon generally found *Dreamland* \"as momentarily annoying as it is infinitely forgettable\" due to its combination of trap percussion and synthesizers being mostly \"strained and unpleasant\"; however, he considered \"Heat Waves\" to be the \"strongest\" mixture of those sounds.[18]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\nA sleeper hit, \"Heat Waves\" is the group's most successful single to date. It was voted into first place on the Australian Triple J Hottest 100 of 2020, making Glass Animals the first British act to top the countdown since Mumford & Sons won the 2009 poll with \"Little Lion Man\". It then spent seven weeks at the top of the Australian ARIA Singles Chart and was later certified as the number one song for 2021 in Australia. It reached No. 1 in March 2021, stayed there until April 2021, and returned to that position in March 2022.[19] It is the first song ever to stay in the Australian top 10 for more than a year, staying there for 85 weeks. It also reached the top 20 in several territories.\n\n\nIn the United States, \"Heat Waves\" peaked at number one on the *Billboard* Hot 100 chart dated 12 March 2022, completing a record-breaking 59-week climb to the position.[20] It dethroned *Encanto*'s \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" after five consecutive weeks at number one. \"Heat Waves\" previously reached number 10 on the Hot 100 in its 42nd week on the chart, breaking the record for the longest climb to the top 10, surpassing Carrie Underwood's \"Before He Cheats\" (2007).[21] The song also reached the top five in its 51st week on the chart, breaking the record previously set by Gabby Barrett's \"I Hope\" (2020).[22] The song was in the top 10 up to its 80th week on the chart. No other song in the chart's history has reached such longevity.[23][24] This longevity has been attributed to, among other things, a popular fan fiction[25] which shipped Dream and GeorgeNotFound, two YouTubers who play *Minecraft*.[24][26]\n\n\nOn the UK Singles Chart the single originally peaked at number 19 in the first half of 2021. After its inclusion in the EA Sports video game *FIFA 21* and wide usage as backing music in various TikTok videos, the song re-entered at number 18 in September 2021 and continued to climb into the top 5.[27][28][29] The viral video also helped the song climb back up 31 places to number 14 on the Irish Singles Chart in its 41st week on the chart, before peaking at number 5. The track has spent a total of 22 weeks in the top 10 to date, the most among tracks in 2021.[30] The song reached number one on the *Billboard* Global 200 in the issue dated 5 March 2022,[31] and also reached the same peak on the Global Excl. US chart.[32]\n\n\n\n## Music videos[edit]\n\n\nA lyric video heavily based on the vaporwave imagery was released through Glass Animals official YouTube account on 20 July 2020. The video was produced by designer Notnarcs. It gained almost 30 million views during its first year on YouTube. As of June 2023, the lyric video on YouTube has amassed over 126 million views.\n\n\nThe official music video for the song, directed by Colin Read, premiered on 29 June 2020. It shows frontman Dave Bayley walking through the streets of East London[33] pulling a wagon stacked with several TVs, filmed by his neighbours using their phones during the COVID-19 lockdowns, before arriving at a venue, setting the TVs up on a stage that then display his bandmates playing their instruments, and singing the rest of the song. Bayley called it \"a love letter to live music and the culture and togetherness surrounding it\".[34] As of August 2023, the music video has amassed over 600 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n\n## Track

The song was written by Styles alongside its producers Kid Harpoon and Tyler Johnson.\n\n\n\"As It Was\" was widely acclaimed by music critics and entered at the top of the UK Singles Chart, becoming Styles's second number-one single after \"Sign of the Times\" in April 2017. \"As It Was\" spent ten weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart, becoming the longest-running number-one and best-selling single of 2022 in his home country. It also became his second number one single in the US; the song spent 15 non-consecutive weeks atop the *Billboard* Hot 100, becoming the longest-running US number one by a UK act and the fifth-longest-running number one in the chart's history.\n\n\n\"As It Was\" became a huge worldwide hit topping the charts in 45 countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore and Sweden.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nHarry Styles announced the title of his third studio album as *Harry's House* on 23 March 2022, unveiling its artwork, a 40-second trailer and the album's release date as 20 May 2022.[1][2] Five days later, he announced the title of its lead single as \"As It Was\", along with pictures of him in a \"sequined, sleeveless red outfit\" and its release date as 1 April 2022.[3][4][5] Simultaneously, posters bearing the lyrics \"It's not the same as it was\" and a picture of Styles sitting on a big ball appeared in various cities.[6] He released a teaser of the music video on 30 March, which included an \"energetic drum beat\" and a \"sunny electric guitar riff\", and depicted him in a red jumpsuit spinning in circles atop a motorised turntable.[7]\n\n\n\n## Lyrics and composition[edit]\n\n\nMusic critics described the song as a guitar-driven synth-pop and new wave track, a noticeable shift from Styles's rock-oriented sounds.[8][9][10][11][12] Chris Willman of *Variety* noted that it takes heavy inspiration from Depeche Mode and a-ha, while also suggesting that it adopted a style similar to the Weeknd's 2019 single \"Blinding Lights\".[9] *EUPHORIA* magazine felt that Styles was inspired by James Bay's 2018 single \"Pink Lemonade\", adding that the two songs sound \"eerily similar\".[13] Lyrically, \"As It Was\" is rooted in personal transitions and depicts a feeling of loss and loneliness.[14]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nProfessional ratings| Review scores |\n| --- |\n| Source | Rating |\n| *The Guardian* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[15] |\n| *NME* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[16] |\n\n\n\"As It Was\" received critical acclaim. *NME*'s Rhian Daly gave the song five out of five stars, describing it as \"not a million miles away from where *Fine Line* left off, but hardly retreading old ground.\" According to Daly, the track suggests *Harry's House* will solidify Styles \"as one of the current pop landscapes' greats\".[16] Beau Beaumont-Thomas of *The Guardian* also rated the song five stars and called it \"one of his very best\", writing, \"Many will pore over the gossipy, self-referential lyrics, but Styles's song is for everyone: an effervescent, high-tempo hit to have you clicking your heels.\"[15] In his review for *Rolling Stone*, Rob Sheffield regarded \"As It Was\" as one of Styles's most \"emotionally powerful\" songs, calling it a \"daring change-up\" and a \"straight-from-the-heart cry that's also an irresistible dance-floor challenge.\"[10] Sahar Ghadirian of *Clash* magazine deemed it a \"powerhouse\" and Styles \"at his most vulnerable\". Ghadirian appreciated the \"dream fusion\" of synth-pop with electro rock and commented that the bells end the song on \"a euphoric high\".[17] Thania Garcia of *Variety* magazine described the song as being \"new wave-inspired\".[18]\n\n\n*Evening Standard* reviewer Jochan Embley meanwhile found the track inferior to the singer's previous singles \"Watermelon Sugar\" and \"Adore You\", but wrote that Styles and his collaborators \"still know how to make an instantly enjoyable tune\".[19] Olivia Horn of *Pitchfork* was less impressed and bemoaned that the song \"winds down without any real payoff\", citing the circuitousness of the lyrics as \"a frequent shortcoming in Styles' songwriting.\"[20]\n\n\n*Entertainment Weekly* named \"As It Was\" as the best song of 2022: \"The synths gallop like excitable ponies while his warm-wash vocals swoop and dip, a sweet little slice of life-support disco for the lonely.\"[21] *USA Today* also chose it as the best song of the year: \"At first, it sounds like a generically pretty pop song. But then you understand Styles' longing for the perfect something that was yanked away, his dreamy vocals taking on a sadness as he recalls that blissful bubble and resigns himself with a sigh to his current reality. The giggly opening by his goddaughter, pillowy '80s-rooted synths, tubular bells and urging beat contradict his pensiveness.\"[22] *Billboard* ranked it at number 3 on their \"The 100 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"Coming in at a lean 2:47, \"As It Was\" serves as a broader anthem about how nothing is \"the same as it was\" before the pandemic, but on a micro level, it turns out Styles isn't the same either as he grapples with fame and the realization that \"he's no good alone\" when left to his own devices and pills.\"[23]\n\n\nBBC ranked it at number 3 on their \"25 of the best songs released in 2022\" list: \"As It Was is a vapour trail of a song, silvery and airborne, as Harry Styles searches for meaning amidst break-ups and loneliness and personal turmoil.\"[24] *NME* ranked it at number 3 on their \"The 50 best songs of 2022\" list: \"It's hard not to tumble into the vast emotional depths of 'As It Was' and look beyond everything else that made this song such a triumph. Change is a constant beneath the track's heart-raising BPM and twinkling melodies: here, Harry Styles' empathetic songwriting saw him fight for stability amid breakups and personal upheavals, finding strength in a renewed relationship with himself.\"[25] *The Guardian* ranked it at number 5 on their \"The 20 best songs of 2022\" list: \"Occupying the slim valley between A-ha's Take On Me and Vampire Weekend, As It Was delivers bruised-peach hurt, sophisticated languor from the back seat of a tastefully expensive car. He can sing something as vague as \"In this world, it's just us / You know it's not the same as it was\" and make you feel that he really means it\"[26] *i-D* ranked it at number 10 on their \"The 100 best songs of 2022\" list: \"For an artist reckoning with blinding attention towards his public persona, this infectious, upbeat song about loneliness and change felt like a balm both for the artist and his fans.\"[27]\n\n\n*NPR* ranked it at number 12 on their \"100 Best Songs Of 2022\" list: \"Like a fling who would have never dated you in real life saying arrivederci at summer's end, this song is by turns forlorn, resigned, apologetic and a little caddish. Its slippery nostalgia is grounded in a synth line evoking the New Romantic era of Styles' parents' youth and in the singer's cool, bossa nova-ish croon, which sounds like the way it feels when that departing lover wistfully strokes your hair. The Easter-eggy verses matter to fans, but the chorus is what made \"As It Was\" so sticky in 2022: It renders regret comfortable, a service everyone needs in a time of chronic heartbreak.\"[28] *Complex* ranked it at number 27 on their \"50 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"\"As It Was\" is a beautiful, mesmerizing record that lives up to all the buzz it's generated on TikTok (and everywhere else on the internet and radio). It carries an energetic tone thanks to the uptempo instrumentation, and Harry Styles adds layers of emotion with his soft vocals. \"As It Was\" is a fun and danceable record that continues to demonstrate his power as one of the biggest pop stars in the world.\"[29] *Paste* ranked it at number 29 on their \"The 50 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"Our first glimpse into Harry Styles' newest era, where he is fully immersed in his own flamboyant intricacies, the song is a thoughtful rumination on the exhaustion that stems from not enough love and too much fame.\"[30]\n\n\n*The Fader* ranked it at number 33 on their \"The 100 best songs of 2022\" list: \"On *Harry's House* lead single \"As It Was,\" the singer hits an effervescent pitch both sonically and conceptually, expressing a willingness to embrace introspection while delivering one of the most textured performances in his loaded discography.\"[31] *Pitchfork* ranked it at number 100 on their \"The 100 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"\"As It Was\" is the kind of twinkly little confection that would easily get the indie kids pogoing at any local DIY dance night at any point in the last two decades. It just happens to have been recorded by one of the biggest pop stars in the world in 2022 instead of, say, the Strokes twenty years earlier. \"You know it's not the same as it was,\" Harry Styles sighs, giving a nod to the easy bait of nostalgia. A pointillist synth line tap dances through the song, and all over that nagging pandemic-era malaise we're all desperately trying to shake. Resistance is futile.\"[32]\n\n\n*Associated Press* placed it on their \"Top Songs of 2022\" list: \"The song is deceptively upbeat with a jingly synth-pop beat and a little kid's voice as the intro and wedding bells at the end. But the lyrics are self-referentially melancholic as he accepts the reality of change that even he is not quite ready for.\"[33] *Esquire* placed it on their \"The 45 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"\"As It Was\" was Harry Styles first single this year, and it did not disappoint. This glittering track fuels nostalgia as Styles sings about life which is, of course, always changing.

It will be a music video I will never forget and now I can happily retire.\" Nevertheless, Muino continued her filmmaking work afterwards.[75] On YouTube, the video has received over 630 million views and 7.6 million likes as of November 2023.[78]\n\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Organization\n | Award\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022\n |

The song was written by Styles alongside its producers Kid Harpoon and Tyler Johnson.\n\n\n\"As It Was\" was widely acclaimed by music critics and entered at the top of the UK Singles Chart, becoming Styles's second number-one single after \"Sign of the Times\" in April 2017. \"As It Was\" spent ten weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart, becoming the longest-running number-one and best-selling single of 2022 in his home country. It also became his second number one single in the US; the song spent 15 non-consecutive weeks atop the *Billboard* Hot 100, becoming the longest-running US number one by a UK act and the fifth-longest-running number one in the chart's history.\n\n\n\"As It Was\" became a huge worldwide hit topping the charts in 45 countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore and Sweden.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nHarry Styles announced the title of his third studio album as *Harry's House* on 23 March 2022, unveiling its artwork, a 40-second trailer and the album's release date as 20 May 2022.[1][2] Five days later, he announced the title of its lead single as \"As It Was\", along with pictures of him in a \"sequined, sleeveless red outfit\" and its release date as 1 April 2022.[3][4][5] Simultaneously, posters bearing the lyrics \"It's not the same as it was\" and a picture of Styles sitting on a big ball appeared in various cities.[6] He released a teaser of the music video on 30 March, which included an \"energetic drum beat\" and a \"sunny electric guitar riff\", and depicted him in a red jumpsuit spinning in circles atop a motorised turntable.[7]\n\n\n\n## Lyrics and composition[edit]\n\n\nMusic critics described the song as a guitar-driven synth-pop and new wave track, a noticeable shift from Styles's rock-oriented sounds.[8][9][10][11][12] Chris Willman of *Variety* noted that it takes heavy inspiration from Depeche Mode and a-ha, while also suggesting that it adopted a style similar to the Weeknd's 2019 single \"Blinding Lights\".[9] *EUPHORIA* magazine felt that Styles was inspired by James Bay's 2018 single \"Pink Lemonade\", adding that the two songs sound \"eerily similar\".[13] Lyrically, \"As It Was\" is rooted in personal transitions and depicts a feeling of loss and loneliness.[14]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nProfessional ratings| Review scores |\n| --- |\n| Source | Rating |\n| *The Guardian* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[15] |\n| *NME* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[16] |\n\n\n\"As It Was\" received critical acclaim. *NME*'s Rhian Daly gave the song five out of five stars, describing it as \"not a million miles away from where *Fine Line* left off, but hardly retreading old ground.\" According to Daly, the track suggests *Harry's House* will solidify Styles \"as one of the current pop landscapes' greats\".[16] Beau Beaumont-Thomas of *The Guardian* also rated the song five stars and called it \"one of his very best\", writing, \"Many will pore over the gossipy, self-referential lyrics, but Styles's song is for everyone: an effervescent, high-tempo hit to have you clicking your heels.\"[15] In his review for *Rolling Stone*, Rob Sheffield regarded \"As It Was\" as one of Styles's most \"emotionally powerful\" songs, calling it a \"daring change-up\" and a \"straight-from-the-heart cry that's also an irresistible dance-floor challenge.\"[10] Sahar Ghadirian of *Clash* magazine deemed it a \"powerhouse\" and Styles \"at his most vulnerable\". Ghadirian appreciated the \"dream fusion\" of synth-pop with electro rock and commented that the bells end the song on \"a euphoric high\".[17] Thania Garcia of *Variety* magazine described the song as being \"new wave-inspired\".[18]\n\n\n*Evening Standard* reviewer Jochan Embley meanwhile found the track inferior to the singer's previous singles \"Watermelon Sugar\" and \"Adore You\", but wrote that Styles and his collaborators \"still know how to make an instantly enjoyable tune\".[19] Olivia Horn of *Pitchfork* was less impressed and bemoaned that the song \"winds down without any real payoff\", citing the circuitousness of the lyrics as \"a frequent shortcoming in Styles' songwriting.\"[20]\n\n\n*Entertainment Weekly* named \"As It Was\" as the best song of 2022: \"The synths gallop like excitable ponies while his warm-wash vocals swoop and dip, a sweet little slice of life-support disco for the lonely.\"[21] *USA Today* also chose it as the best song of the year: \"At first, it sounds like a generically pretty pop song. But then you understand Styles' longing for the perfect something that was yanked away, his dreamy vocals taking on a sadness as he recalls that blissful bubble and resigns himself with a sigh to his current reality. The giggly opening by his goddaughter, pillowy '80s-rooted synths, tubular bells and urging beat contradict his pensiveness.\"[22] *Billboard* ranked it at number 3 on their \"The 100 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"Coming in at a lean 2:47, \"As It Was\" serves as a broader anthem about how nothing is \"the same as it was\" before the pandemic, but on a micro level, it turns out Styles isn't the same either as he grapples with fame and the realization that \"he's no good alone\" when left to his own devices and pills.\"[23]\n\n\nBBC ranked it at number 3 on their \"25 of the best songs released in 2022\" list: \"As It Was is a vapour trail of a song, silvery and airborne, as Harry Styles searches for meaning amidst break-ups and loneliness and personal turmoil.\"[24] *NME* ranked it at number 3 on their \"The 50 best songs of 2022\" list: \"It's hard not to tumble into the vast emotional depths of 'As It Was' and look beyond everything else that made this song such a triumph. Change is a constant beneath the track's heart-raising BPM and twinkling melodies: here, Harry Styles' empathetic songwriting saw him fight for stability amid breakups and personal upheavals, finding strength in a renewed relationship with himself.\"[25] *The Guardian* ranked it at number 5 on their \"The 20 best songs of 2022\" list: \"Occupying the slim valley between A-ha's Take On Me and Vampire Weekend, As It Was delivers bruised-peach hurt, sophisticated languor from the back seat of a tastefully expensive car. He can sing something as vague as \"In this world, it's just us / You know it's not the same as it was\" and make you feel that he really means it\"[26] *i-D* ranked it at number 10 on their \"The 100 best songs of 2022\" list: \"For an artist reckoning with blinding attention towards his public persona, this infectious, upbeat song about loneliness and change felt like a balm both for the artist and his fans.\"[27]\n\n\n*NPR* ranked it at number 12 on their \"100 Best Songs Of 2022\" list: \"Like a fling who would have never dated you in real life saying arrivederci at summer's end, this song is by turns forlorn, resigned, apologetic and a little caddish. Its slippery nostalgia is grounded in a synth line evoking the New Romantic era of Styles' parents' youth and in the singer's cool, bossa nova-ish croon, which sounds like the way it feels when that departing lover wistfully strokes your hair. The Easter-eggy verses matter to fans, but the chorus is what made \"As It Was\" so sticky in 2022: It renders regret comfortable, a service everyone needs in a time of chronic heartbreak.\"[28] *Complex* ranked it at number 27 on their \"50 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"\"As It Was\" is a beautiful, mesmerizing record that lives up to all the buzz it's generated on TikTok (and everywhere else on the internet and radio). It carries an energetic tone thanks to the uptempo instrumentation, and Harry Styles adds layers of emotion with his soft vocals. \"As It Was\" is a fun and danceable record that continues to demonstrate his power as one of the biggest pop stars in the world.\"[29] *Paste* ranked it at number 29 on their \"The 50 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"Our first glimpse into Harry Styles' newest era, where he is fully immersed in his own flamboyant intricacies, the song is a thoughtful rumination on the exhaustion that stems from not enough love and too much fame.\"[30]\n\n\n*The Fader* ranked it at number 33 on their \"The 100 best songs of 2022\" list: \"On *Harry's House* lead single \"As It Was,\" the singer hits an effervescent pitch both sonically and conceptually, expressing a willingness to embrace introspection while delivering one of the most textured performances in his loaded discography.\"[31] *Pitchfork* ranked it at number 100 on their \"The 100 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"\"As It Was\" is the kind of twinkly little confection that would easily get the indie kids pogoing at any local DIY dance night at any point in the last two decades. It just happens to have been recorded by one of the biggest pop stars in the world in 2022 instead of, say, the Strokes twenty years earlier. \"You know it's not the same as it was,\" Harry Styles sighs, giving a nod to the easy bait of nostalgia. A pointillist synth line tap dances through the song, and all over that nagging pandemic-era malaise we're all desperately trying to shake. Resistance is futile.\"[32]\n\n\n*Associated Press* placed it on their \"Top Songs of 2022\" list: \"The song is deceptively upbeat with a jingly synth-pop beat and a little kid's voice as the intro and wedding bells at the end. But the lyrics are self-referentially melancholic as he accepts the reality of change that even he is not quite ready for.\"[33] *Esquire* placed it on their \"The 45 Best Songs of 2022\" list: \"\"As It Was\" was Harry Styles first single this year, and it did not disappoint. This glittering track fuels nostalgia as Styles sings about life which is, of course, always changing. (Reality bites!)\"[34]\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect year-end rankings\n| Publication\n | List\n | Rank\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Billboard** | The 100 Best Songs of 2022: Staff List\n | 3\n | [35]\n |\n| *Consequence of Sound* | Top 50 Songs of 2022\n | 9\n | [36]\n |\n| *DIY magazine* | DIY's tracks of 2022\n | 12\n | [37]\n |\n| *Entertainment Weekly* | The 10 best songs of 2022\n | 1\n | [38]\n |\n| *Esquire* | The 45 Best Songs of 2022 (So Far)\n | N/A\n | [39]\n |\n| *Exclaim* | Exclaim!'s 25 Best Songs of 2022\n | 8\n | [40]\n |\n| *NME* | Top 50 Best Songs of 2022\n | 3\n | [41]\n |\n| *Pitchfork* | The 100 Best Songs of 2022\n | 100\n | [42]\n |\n| *Rolling Stone* | The 100 Best Songs of 2022\n | 9\n | [43]\n |\n| *Slate* | Plus the best songs\n | N/A\n | [44]\n |\n| *The Guardian* | The 20 Best Songs of 2022\n | 5\n | [45]\n |\n| *UPROXX* | The Best Songs Of 2022\n | N/A\n | [46]\n |\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\n\"As It Was\" was an immediate success; it earned the Guinness World Records title for the most streamed track on Spotify within 24 hours by a male artist, and broke the Apple Music streaming record for most first-day streams for a 2022 release.[47][48] The song also opened atop the *Billboard* Global 200 with the greatest global streaming week of 2022, becoming Styles's first number-one on the tally.[49]\n\n\nIn the UK, \"As It Was\" became Styles's second solo number-one on the singles chart, debuting with the biggest sales and streaming weeks of any single in 2022.[50] It spent ten weeks at number one on the UK singles chart, becoming the longest-running number one of the year in the UK.[51] It became the most-streamed track (149.6 million streams), most physically purchased (12,000 units), most digitally downloaded (47,000 units) and overall, best-selling (1.3 million equivalent units) track in the UK in 2022, as of October 2022[update].[52]\n\n\n\"As It Was\" entered at number one on the *Billboard* Hot 100, becoming Styles' second number-one single after \"Watermelon Sugar\" (2019).[53] The song garnered the most single-day streams on Spotify in the United States, surpassing Olivia Rodrigo's \"Drivers License\" (2021).[54] After the single's debut at No. 1, \"As It Was\" fell out of the No. 1 position and returned multiple times between April and September 2022; when it returned to No. 1 for the week ending 3 September 2022, it became the first song ever to have five separate runs in the top position.[55] \"As It Was\" spent 15 weeks atop the *Billboard* Hot 100, becoming the longest-running US number one by a UK act, the second longest-running No. 1 with no accompanying artists (i.e. a solo-billed song) and the fifth longest running number-one in the chart's history.[56][57]\n\n\n\"As It Was\" spent 18 weeks at number one on the Canadian Hot 100[58] and peaked at number one in Australia,[59] Austria,[60] Belgium,[61] Croatia,[62] Denmark,[63] Germany,[64] Greece,[65] Ireland,[66] Israel,[67] Lithuania,[68] the Netherlands,[69] New Zealand,[70] Slovakia,[71] Sweden,[72] and Switzerland.[73]\n\n\n\"As It Was\" ranked as the most popular song on Spotify and the second most popular song on Apple Music in 2022.[74]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\nThe music video for \"As It Was\" was released alongside the song.[75] In the clip, Styles joins dancer Mathilde Lin on a turning platform and performs choreography by Yoann Bourgeois[76] in the Barbican to release negative emotions.[8] The video was filmed in London: apart from the Barbican Centre, it was also filmed at Lindley Hall near the Houses of Parliament, and the penguin pool at London Zoo.[77] It was directed by Tanu Muino, who stated that directing for Styles was \"a bucket list dream come true\" but, on the second day of shooting, Muino's home country of Ukraine was invaded by Russia, rendering the process a \"bittersweet\" experience; nevertheless, Muino and her team from Ukraine \"poured so much love into this video and you can see it on screen. It will be a music video I will never forget and now I can happily retire.\" Nevertheless, Muino continued her filmmaking work afterwards.[75] On YouTube, the video has received over 630 million views and 7.6 million likes as of November 2023.[78]\n\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Organization\n | Award\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022\n |

Adele wrote the song with its producer, Greg Kurstin. Columbia Records released it as the album's lead single on 15 October 2021. It is a torch song and ballad which places emphasis on Adele's vocals, set over progressively louder-growing piano instrumentation. In its lyrics, she addresses her divorce and pleads for forgiveness and understanding from her son, ex-husband, and herself.\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" received positive reviews from music critics, who discussed it in relation to Adele's previous music and praised her vocals and the lyrics. At the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, the song won Best Pop Solo Performance from its four nominations. It was nominated for several other awards and won the 2022 Brit Award for Song of the Year. \"Easy on Me\" reached number one on the charts in several countries. It became Adele's longest-running chart topper in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n\nXavier Dolan directed the music video for \"Easy on Me\", which was released on 15 October 2021. It references several previous Adele videos and depicts her moving out of the same house where the \"Hello\" (2015) music video was filmed. She performed the song at the 23rd NRJ Music Awards, on her television specials, and at the concert residency Weekends with Adele. Artists including Kanye West, Chloe Bailey, and Keith Urban sang cover versions of it.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n![Greg Kurstin in a striped t-shirt and jacket](image)Greg Kurstin (*pictured in 2017*) produced and co-wrote \"Easy on Me\".\nGreg Kurstin produced and co-wrote three tracks on Adele's third studio album, *25* (2015),[1] which included the song \"Hello\". It was released as the lead single from the album and reached number one in 36 countries, and its music video broke the Vevo record for most single-day views.[2][3] She kept a low profile after completing the associated concert tour, Adele Live 2016, in 2017.[4] Adele had begun working on the follow-up album by the following year.[5] She filed for divorce from her husband, Simon Konecki, in September 2019,[6] which inspired the album. After experiencing anxiety, Adele undertook therapy sessions and mended her estranged relationship with her father.[7] The divorce's effect on her son plagued Adele during the following years. She decided to have regular conversations with him, which she recorded following advice from her therapist.[7][8] These conversations inspired Adele's return to the studio, and the album took shape as a body of work that would explain to her son why she left his father.[7]\n\n\nAdele wrote \"Easy on Me\" with its producer, Kurstin.[9] She conceived the song's verses while taking a shower. Adele's friends would tell her to \"go easy on yourself, don't beat yourself up too much about your decisions\". The advice resonated with her, and she decided that she had to be more gentle with herself.[10] Adele's friends were unimpressed by an initial snippet of it but she claimed that they appreciated her patience.[11] Three songs were in contention for release as the lead single from *30* (2021). She eventually chose \"Easy on Me\" because it had a \"soaring chorus\" and \"just felt like a me song\"; she saw it as the right song for her return after the hiatus.[12] Adele wanted to avoid releasing something that would propel her to more stardom: \"There isn't a bombastic 'Hello,' But I don't want another song like that. That song catapulted me in fame to another level that I don't want to happen again.\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Composition and lyrics[edit]\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" is three minutes and 44 seconds long.[13] Kurstin produced the song and engineered it with Alex Pasco and Julian Burg. Kurstin plays bass guitar, kick drum, and piano. Tom Elmhirst helmed the song's mixing at Electric Lady Studios in New York, and Randy Merrill handled mastering at Sterling Sound in New Jersey.[9]\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" is a torch song and ballad[14] which places emphasis on Adele's vocals over piano instrumentation.[15] The song opens with a gentle piano, which intensifies as it progresses, leading into the vocals.[16][17] Adele's voice mimics this according to *The Guardian*'s Alexis Petridis, as it \"sounds initially wounded, then soars\".[17] The song almost completely eschews the use of percussion instruments,[14][18] but a bass drum and bass guitar are played during its latter half.[19] In the chorus, Adele delivers the song title in elongated vocal runs and stretches the \"e\" sound through eight different musical notes.[19] Mikael Wood of the *Los Angeles Times* described her performance as \"soaring yet slightly crinkly around the edges\".[20]\n\n\nIn the lyrics, Adele addresses her divorce and asks for forgiveness and understanding from her son,[21][22] ex-husband,[19][23] and herself.[24] She tries to explain to her son why she chose to disassemble the stable life he had during her marriage.[25] Adele acknowledges that she still has a lot of self-discovery to do and compares herself to a child: \"I was still a child / Didn't get the chance to / Feel the world around me.\"[22] According to *Slant Magazine*'s Alexa Camp, the lyric reflects her \"grappling with a form of arrested development\".[26] In the song's bridge, Adele asserts that the divorce was well-intentioned and in the hopes of a better future.[15] Neil McCormick of *The Daily Telegraph* described the song as \"effectively, a huge, abject, shame- and excuse-filled apology\".[19]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n![Chris Stapleton in a hat and black shirt](image)Adele recorded a duet version of \"Easy on Me\" with Chris Stapleton (*pictured in 2019*).\nOn 1 October 2021, the number \"30\" was projected on several buildings and landmarks around the world.[27] Three days later, Adele updated her social media accounts for the first time in months.[28] On 5 October, Adele hinted at the song and its music video by posting a teaser on the accounts. The black-and-white clip played an instrumental track and depicted Adele putting a cassette into the tape deck of a truck.[29][30][31] On 9 October, Adele shared a 40-second preview of it via Instagram Live.[32] \"Easy on Me\" was released on 15 October and marked her first single in nearly five years.[27][33] Sony Music sent it for radio airplay in Italy the same day.[34]\n\n\nIn the United States, Columbia Records released \"Easy on Me\" to adult contemporary and triple A stations on 18 October, and contemporary hit radio the following day.[35][36][37] The song was issued as a CD single in Germany on 22 October.[38] Columbia released a cassette single on 5 November 2021.[39] Adele recorded a duet version of it with Chris Stapleton, which was sent to country radio by In2une Nashville on 19 November.[a][41] With 5.4 million audience impressions,[b] this version became Adele's first entry on the Country Airplay chart at number 25. *Billboard*'s Gary Trust wrote that it made \"unprecedented airplay chart history\".[43] In October 2021, Ocado noted a 26 percent increase in tissue sales in the United Kingdom and connected this to the release of \"Easy on Me\", along with the cool weather: \"We also suspect Adele's new song about heartbreak may have also had something to do with it.\"[44]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nProfessional ratings| Review scores |\n| --- |\n| Source | Rating |\n| *The Daily Telegraph* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[19] |\n| *Evening Standard* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[45] |\n| *The Guardian* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[17] |\n| *i* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[46] |\n| *The Independent* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[25] |\n| *NME* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[15] |\n| *The Times* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[47] |\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" received positive reviews from music critics.[48][49] Some commented on the production. McCormick thought the song was a daring return for Adele and exemplified the sheer crux of \"what music is, and why it means so much to us\".[19] Fiona Sturges of *i* believed it is wholehearted, anthemic, and places emphasis on Adele's voice, but it has a \"slightly over-produced sheen\" which reduces its sadness.[46] Likewise, *The Times*' Will Hodgkinson thought \"Easy on Me\" was fine and seasoned but \"a sheen of thoroughly American professionalism\" prevented its emotional resonance.[47]\n\n\nCritics discussed \"Easy on Me\" in relation to Adele's catalogue. Some thought it was a typical Adele song.[c] The *Evening Standard*'s Jochan Embley believed it did not compare to the sadness of \"Someone Like You\" (2011) or the emotion of \"Hello\" but was equally ardent.[45] Alexandra Pollard of *The Independent* thought it did not have a catchy melody like \"Hello\" but was just as sad and pithy and more intricate.[25] Petridis stated that it would not \"stop the listener in their tracks\" like \"Someone Like You\" but was relatable and more memorable than some tracks on *25*.[17] *Billboard*'s Jason Lipshutz likened several elements of \"Easy on Me\" to prior Adele songs but thought it was distinguished by its different lyrical theme.[52]\n\n\nAdele's vocals were the subject of commentary. Embley believed they were some of her best: \"She's so elegantly controlled, so piercingly poignant\".[45] *NME*'s Nick Levine thought the song delivered to the high expectations due to her prowess in communicating unvarnished emotion through her vocals and lyricism. He added that Adele sounds undoubtedly and magnificently like herself but \"richer and more confident\".[15] Cat Zhang of *Pitchfork* praised her delivery and said it is distinctive at a time when under-singing is popular. She added that despite dealing with a new breakup, Adele provides the same contentment.[50] Writing for *Rolling Stone*, Rob Sheffield thought she sang with more panache and delicacy but did not eschew \"the primal firepower\" that famed her.[53] *PopMatters*'s Peter Piatkowski stated that with her usual pristine performance, she exudes the immense sorrow she experiences and molds her great and pliable voice.[54]\n\n\nSome discussed the lyrics. Chris Willman of *Variety* believed that the theme of asking for forgiveness strayed from Adele's previous releases, portraying her as \"the possible offendee, not the offended\".[55] Writing for *The Line of Best Fit*, David Cobbald thought it was \"the most 'hunny'\" song on *30*. He noted its metaphors about water and opined it conveys a maturity and headway from the time of *25*.[56] Piatkowski believed that the lyrics were foreseeably intense and portrayed \"genuine and elegiac\" pain.[54] Levine opined the lyrics will relate with \"anyone going through a quarter-life crisis, a mid-life crisis, or just a crisis of a hangover\" and were likely to make them cry easily.[15]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" has been included in rankings of Adele's discography. *Rolling Stone* named it her 10th-best song in 2021.[57] *Far Out*'s Tyler Golsen and Jamie Kahn included it at number 17 in 2022.[58] That same year, *American Songwriter*'s Tina Benitez-Eves declared \"Easy on Me\" Adele's best song.[59] It was included on critical lists of the best songs of 2021, by *Billboard* at number 14,[60] *The Forty-Five* and *NME* at number 26,[61][62] and *Consequence* at number 27.[63] The song also appeared in an unranked list by *Vogue*.[64]\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" received several awards and nominations. It won the Brit Award for Song of the Year at the 2022 ceremony.[65] That year, \"Easy on Me\" also received the *Gaffa* Award for Foreign Song of the Year,[66] the Juno Award for Video of the Year,[67] and the New Music Award for Top 40/CHR Song of the Year.[68] At the 65th Annual Grammy Awards in 2023, the song won Best Pop Solo Performance and was nominated for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Music Video.[69] Other nominations include The Song of 2021 and The Music Video of 2021 at the 47th People's Choice Awards,[70] Favourite Pop Song and Favourite Music Video at the American Music Awards of 2022,[71] Song of the Year and Best Lyrics at the 2022 iHeartRadio Music Awards,[72] the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically,[73] and the MTV Video Music Award for Song of the Year.[74]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\nUpon release, \"Easy on Me\" achieved success on streaming platforms. It became the most streamed song on Spotify, both in a day[d] and a single week.[e][77] In the United Kingdom, \"Easy on Me\" opened with 3.2 million Spotify streams, the most received by any song in a day.[77] It also broke the record for the most streamed song in a single week in the country, with 24 million streams.[78] On Amazon Music, it earned the most first-day streams globally and the most first-day Alexa requests for any song in the platform's history.[79] \"Easy on Me\" debuted at number 195 on the *Billboard* Global 200 with just five hours of tracking and became Adele's first song to reach the chart's summit the following week. That week, it sold 136,300 downloads, the third-largest sales week for any song on that chart, and earned 178.2 million streams, the second-largest streaming week. It also became the second number one song in history to double the chart points of the number two.[80]\n\n\nIn the United States, \"Easy on Me\" debuted at number 68 on the *Billboard* Hot 100 with its first five hours of tracking.[81] The following week, it became Adele's fifth chart-topping single. It also debuted at number one on the Digital Song Sales and Streaming Songs charts, and number four on Radio Songs where it earned the highest debut ever.[82] \"Easy on Me\" recorded the most first-week plays among all songs in US radio history and became the first to be most-added on five radio formats in a single week.[83] *Billboard* named it one of the biggest number one singles \"of the last 30 years\".[84] The song reached number one on the *Billboard* Adult Contemporary airplay chart, becoming Adele's sixth leader on the list and had the quickest trajectory to number one for a non-holiday song since \"Hello\".[85] During its sixth week on the Hot 100, Adele earned simultaneous top-five placements with \"Easy on Me\" at number one and \"Oh My God\" debuting at number five.[86] \"Easy on Me\" stayed at number one for ten weeks, tying \"Hello\" as Adele's longest-running number one song on the Hot 100.[87] In its fourteenth week, \"Easy on Me\" became the first song to surpass 100 million in radio reach since the Weeknd's \"Blinding Lights\" (2019) one and a half year earlier.[88] The Recording Industry Association of America certified it 4× Platinum in November 2022.[89]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Easy on Me\" debuted at number one on the Official Singles Chart on the chart issued for 28 October 2021. With 217,300 units, it marked the highest first week sales for any song since 2017.[78] \"Easy on Me\" spent eight nonconsecutive weeks at number one, becoming her longest-running number one single in the UK.[90][91] The British Phonographic Industry certified it 3× Platinum in June 2023.[92] \"Easy on Me\" debuted atop Australia's ARIA Singles Chart, becoming her third song to reach the position.[93] It spent four weeks at the summit and received a 6× Platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association.[94][95] In Canada, \"Easy on Me\" spent eight weeks at number one on the Canadian Hot 100.[96] Music Canada certified it 3× Platinum in January 2022.[97] Elsewhere, \"Easy on Me\" reached number one in Austria,[98] Belgium,[99] Costa Rica,[100] Croatia,[101] Czech Republic,[102] Denmark,[103] Germany,[104] Iceland,[105] Ireland,[106] Israel,[107] Italy,[108] Lithuania,[109] Malaysia,[110] the Netherlands,[111] New Zealand,[112] Norway,[113] Singapore,[114] Slovakia,[115] South Africa,[116] Sweden,[117] and Switzerland.[118] The song was certified 2× Diamond in Brazil,[119] Diamond in France,[120] 3× Platinum in Portugal and Switzerland,[121][122] 2× Platinum in Denmark,[123] Italy,[124] Mexico,[125] New Zealand,[126] Poland,[127] and Sweden,[128] Platinum in Belgium,[129] Germany,[130] Spain,[119] and Greece,[131] and Gold in Austria.[132]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\nXavier Dolan, who had previously directed the music video for \"Hello\", also directed the one for \"Easy on Me\". The latter was filmed in the same house as \"Hello\", at the Chemin Jordan and Domaine Dumont Chapelle Ste-Agnès in Sutton, Quebec, on 15 and 16 September 2021.[133][134][135] The video starts black-and-white before changing to full colour midway. According to Camp, it \"picks up where 'Hello' left off\".[26] Adele gazes across the empty house and outside the window before packing up her belongings, putting on sunglasses, and moving out.[135][136] She talks with someone on a mobile phone[137][138] and inserts a cassette into the tape deck of a furniture truck, which plays \"Easy on Me\".[46][139] Adele mourns the end of her own marriage while driving away and spectating a separate couple's engagement celebration as several pages of sheet music fly out of the car's windows.[46][135][140]\n\n\nThe video was released on 15 October 2021 at midnight UK time to 200,000 viewers during the premiere. It reached 12 million views within 12 hours and 90 million within six days of release.[136][140] Several critics thought it referenced other Adele music videos, including \"Hello\", \"Rolling in the Deep\" (2010), and \"Chasing Pavements\" (2008).[140][138][137] *Parade*'s Rose Maura Lorre described it as a sequel to \"Hello\" and compared a chair in it to the one in the \"Rolling in the Deep\" music video.[138] Sophia McFarland of *The Spokesman-Review* believed it was \"a cinematic masterpiece in itself\".[140] BBC News' Mark Savage opined that the transition from black and white to colours represented \"the sound of a woman who has dismantled her entire world, realising that she needn't feel guilty for putting herself first\".[141] A video of bloopers from the production of the music video was released on 4 November 2021.[139]\n\n\n\n## Live performances and cover versions[edit]\n\n\nAdele performed \"Easy on Me\" live for the first time during her CBS special *Adele One Night Only* (2021).[142] She reprised the song at the 23rd NRJ Music Awards on 20 November 2021.[143] Adele hit an incorrect note during her first attempt at singing it for her ITV special *An Audience with Adele* (2021) and restarted the performance: \"I'm shitting myself.\"[144] She performed \"Easy on Me\" during her British Summer Time concerts on 1 and 2 July 2022.[145] Adele included the song in the set list for Weekends with Adele, her 2022–2023 concert residency.[146][147] She wore a full-length black gown and sang afront a coral green backdrop. Reviewing the show on 18 November 2022, *The New York Times*' Lindsay Zoladz believed Adele seemed nervous and \"relied a bit too heavily on encouraging the crowd to sing her lyrics\", and *Harper's Bazaar*'s Bianca Betancourt thought she \"appeared visibly emotional\" before it.[148][149][150]\n\n\nSeveral artists recorded cover versions of \"Easy on Me\". Kanye West and the Sunday Service Choir performed a cover with changed lyrics, as a tribute to Virgil Abloh after he died on 28 November 2021.[151][152] Chloe Bailey uploaded a cover of the song on 9 December 2021, which included whistle tones and vocal runs; *Uproxx*'s Wongo Okon commented that she sang the challenging song without any problems.[153][154] On 4 January 2022, Travis Barker released a cover, on which he played the drums[155][156] and guitar[157] and transformed it into a rock ballad.[158] The Vitamin String Quartet, whose violin player Leah Zeger had accompanied Adele during the *One Night Only* performance, released a version of \"Easy on Me\" with string instruments on 4 March 2022.[159] Keith Urban introduced his acoustic guitar cover of the song during a March 2022 show: \"I would like to make a special dedication tonight, to somebody I just absolutely adore as a performer, as a songwriter, a trailblazer, [...] We love you Adele, oh yes we do.\"[160][161] In July 2023, 13-year-old musician Nandi Bushell shared her cover of it; she noted in the caption that it was her first video singing and playing piano simultaneously.[162][163][164] \"Easy on Me\" has also been covered by contestants on *The Voice*.[165][166][167]\n\n\n\n## Credits and personnel[edit]\n\n\nCredits are adapted from the liner notes of *30*.[9]\n\n\n\n* Greg Kurstin – producer,

Adele wrote the song with its producer, Greg Kurstin. Columbia Records released it as the album's lead single on 15 October 2021. It is a torch song and ballad which places emphasis on Adele's vocals, set over progressively louder-growing piano instrumentation. In its lyrics, she addresses her divorce and pleads for forgiveness and understanding from her son, ex-husband, and herself.\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" received positive reviews from music critics, who discussed it in relation to Adele's previous music and praised her vocals and the lyrics. At the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, the song won Best Pop Solo Performance from its four nominations. It was nominated for several other awards and won the 2022 Brit Award for Song of the Year. \"Easy on Me\" reached number one on the charts in several countries. It became Adele's longest-running chart topper in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n\nXavier Dolan directed the music video for \"Easy on Me\", which was released on 15 October 2021. It references several previous Adele videos and depicts her moving out of the same house where the \"Hello\" (2015) music video was filmed. She performed the song at the 23rd NRJ Music Awards, on her television specials, and at the concert residency Weekends with Adele. Artists including Kanye West, Chloe Bailey, and Keith Urban sang cover versions of it.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n![Greg Kurstin in a striped t-shirt and jacket](image)Greg Kurstin (*pictured in 2017*) produced and co-wrote \"Easy on Me\".\nGreg Kurstin produced and co-wrote three tracks on Adele's third studio album, *25* (2015),[1] which included the song \"Hello\". It was released as the lead single from the album and reached number one in 36 countries, and its music video broke the Vevo record for most single-day views.[2][3] She kept a low profile after completing the associated concert tour, Adele Live 2016, in 2017.[4] Adele had begun working on the follow-up album by the following year.[5] She filed for divorce from her husband, Simon Konecki, in September 2019,[6] which inspired the album. After experiencing anxiety, Adele undertook therapy sessions and mended her estranged relationship with her father.[7] The divorce's effect on her son plagued Adele during the following years. She decided to have regular conversations with him, which she recorded following advice from her therapist.[7][8] These conversations inspired Adele's return to the studio, and the album took shape as a body of work that would explain to her son why she left his father.[7]\n\n\nAdele wrote \"Easy on Me\" with its producer, Kurstin.[9] She conceived the song's verses while taking a shower. Adele's friends would tell her to \"go easy on yourself, don't beat yourself up too much about your decisions\". The advice resonated with her, and she decided that she had to be more gentle with herself.[10] Adele's friends were unimpressed by an initial snippet of it but she claimed that they appreciated her patience.[11] Three songs were in contention for release as the lead single from *30* (2021). She eventually chose \"Easy on Me\" because it had a \"soaring chorus\" and \"just felt like a me song\"; she saw it as the right song for her return after the hiatus.[12] Adele wanted to avoid releasing something that would propel her to more stardom: \"There isn't a bombastic 'Hello,' But I don't want another song like that. That song catapulted me in fame to another level that I don't want to happen again.\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Composition and lyrics[edit]\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" is three minutes and 44 seconds long.[13] Kurstin produced the song and engineered it with Alex Pasco and Julian Burg. Kurstin plays bass guitar, kick drum, and piano. Tom Elmhirst helmed the song's mixing at Electric Lady Studios in New York, and Randy Merrill handled mastering at Sterling Sound in New Jersey.[9]\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" is a torch song and ballad[14] which places emphasis on Adele's vocals over piano instrumentation.[15] The song opens with a gentle piano, which intensifies as it progresses, leading into the vocals.[16][17] Adele's voice mimics this according to *The Guardian*'s Alexis Petridis, as it \"sounds initially wounded, then soars\".[17] The song almost completely eschews the use of percussion instruments,[14][18] but a bass drum and bass guitar are played during its latter half.[19] In the chorus, Adele delivers the song title in elongated vocal runs and stretches the \"e\" sound through eight different musical notes.[19] Mikael Wood of the *Los Angeles Times* described her performance as \"soaring yet slightly crinkly around the edges\".[20]\n\n\nIn the lyrics, Adele addresses her divorce and asks for forgiveness and understanding from her son,[21][22] ex-husband,[19][23] and herself.[24] She tries to explain to her son why she chose to disassemble the stable life he had during her marriage.[25] Adele acknowledges that she still has a lot of self-discovery to do and compares herself to a child: \"I was still a child / Didn't get the chance to / Feel the world around me.\"[22] According to *Slant Magazine*'s Alexa Camp, the lyric reflects her \"grappling with a form of arrested development\".[26] In the song's bridge, Adele asserts that the divorce was well-intentioned and in the hopes of a better future.[15] Neil McCormick of *The Daily Telegraph* described the song as \"effectively, a huge, abject, shame- and excuse-filled apology\".[19]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n![Chris Stapleton in a hat and black shirt](image)Adele recorded a duet version of \"Easy on Me\" with Chris Stapleton (*pictured in 2019*).\nOn 1 October 2021, the number \"30\" was projected on several buildings and landmarks around the world.[27] Three days later, Adele updated her social media accounts for the first time in months.[28] On 5 October, Adele hinted at the song and its music video by posting a teaser on the accounts. The black-and-white clip played an instrumental track and depicted Adele putting a cassette into the tape deck of a truck.[29][30][31] On 9 October, Adele shared a 40-second preview of it via Instagram Live.[32] \"Easy on Me\" was released on 15 October and marked her first single in nearly five years.[27][33] Sony Music sent it for radio airplay in Italy the same day.[34]\n\n\nIn the United States, Columbia Records released \"Easy on Me\" to adult contemporary and triple A stations on 18 October, and contemporary hit radio the following day.[35][36][37] The song was issued as a CD single in Germany on 22 October.[38] Columbia released a cassette single on 5 November 2021.[39] Adele recorded a duet version of it with Chris Stapleton, which was sent to country radio by In2une Nashville on 19 November.[a][41] With 5.4 million audience impressions,[b] this version became Adele's first entry on the Country Airplay chart at number 25. *Billboard*'s Gary Trust wrote that it made \"unprecedented airplay chart history\".[43] In October 2021, Ocado noted a 26 percent increase in tissue sales in the United Kingdom and connected this to the release of \"Easy on Me\", along with the cool weather: \"We also suspect Adele's new song about heartbreak may have also had something to do with it.\"[44]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nProfessional ratings| Review scores |\n| --- |\n| Source | Rating |\n| *The Daily Telegraph* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[19] |\n| *Evening Standard* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[45] |\n| *The Guardian* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[17] |\n| *i* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[46] |\n| *The Independent* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[25] |\n| *NME* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[15] |\n| *The Times* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[47] |\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" received positive reviews from music critics.[48][49] Some commented on the production. McCormick thought the song was a daring return for Adele and exemplified the sheer crux of \"what music is, and why it means so much to us\".[19] Fiona Sturges of *i* believed it is wholehearted, anthemic, and places emphasis on Adele's voice, but it has a \"slightly over-produced sheen\" which reduces its sadness.[46] Likewise, *The Times*' Will Hodgkinson thought \"Easy on Me\" was fine and seasoned but \"a sheen of thoroughly American professionalism\" prevented its emotional resonance.[47]\n\n\nCritics discussed \"Easy on Me\" in relation to Adele's catalogue. Some thought it was a typical Adele song.[c] The *Evening Standard*'s Jochan Embley believed it did not compare to the sadness of \"Someone Like You\" (2011) or the emotion of \"Hello\" but was equally ardent.[45] Alexandra Pollard of *The Independent* thought it did not have a catchy melody like \"Hello\" but was just as sad and pithy and more intricate.[25] Petridis stated that it would not \"stop the listener in their tracks\" like \"Someone Like You\" but was relatable and more memorable than some tracks on *25*.[17] *Billboard*'s Jason Lipshutz likened several elements of \"Easy on Me\" to prior Adele songs but thought it was distinguished by its different lyrical theme.[52]\n\n\nAdele's vocals were the subject of commentary. Embley believed they were some of her best: \"She's so elegantly controlled, so piercingly poignant\".[45] *NME*'s Nick Levine thought the song delivered to the high expectations due to her prowess in communicating unvarnished emotion through her vocals and lyricism. He added that Adele sounds undoubtedly and magnificently like herself but \"richer and more confident\".[15] Cat Zhang of *Pitchfork* praised her delivery and said it is distinctive at a time when under-singing is popular. She added that despite dealing with a new breakup, Adele provides the same contentment.[50] Writing for *Rolling Stone*, Rob Sheffield thought she sang with more panache and delicacy but did not eschew \"the primal firepower\" that famed her.[53] *PopMatters*'s Peter Piatkowski stated that with her usual pristine performance, she exudes the immense sorrow she experiences and molds her great and pliable voice.[54]\n\n\nSome discussed the lyrics. Chris Willman of *Variety* believed that the theme of asking for forgiveness strayed from Adele's previous releases, portraying her as \"the possible offendee, not the offended\".[55] Writing for *The Line of Best Fit*, David Cobbald thought it was \"the most 'hunny'\" song on *30*. He noted its metaphors about water and opined it conveys a maturity and headway from the time of *25*.[56] Piatkowski believed that the lyrics were foreseeably intense and portrayed \"genuine and elegiac\" pain.[54] Levine opined the lyrics will relate with \"anyone going through a quarter-life crisis, a mid-life crisis, or just a crisis of a hangover\" and were likely to make them cry easily.[15]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" has been included in rankings of Adele's discography. *Rolling Stone* named it her 10th-best song in 2021.[57] *Far Out*'s Tyler Golsen and Jamie Kahn included it at number 17 in 2022.[58] That same year, *American Songwriter*'s Tina Benitez-Eves declared \"Easy on Me\" Adele's best song.[59] It was included on critical lists of the best songs of 2021, by *Billboard* at number 14,[60] *The Forty-Five* and *NME* at number 26,[61][62] and *Consequence* at number 27.[63] The song also appeared in an unranked list by *Vogue*.[64]\n\n\n\"Easy on Me\" received several awards and nominations. It won the Brit Award for Song of the Year at the 2022 ceremony.[65] That year, \"Easy on Me\" also received the *Gaffa* Award for Foreign Song of the Year,[66] the Juno Award for Video of the Year,[67] and the New Music Award for Top 40/CHR Song of the Year.[68] At the 65th Annual Grammy Awards in 2023, the song won Best Pop Solo Performance and was nominated for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Music Video.[69] Other nominations include The Song of 2021 and The Music Video of 2021 at the 47th People's Choice Awards,[70] Favourite Pop Song and Favourite Music Video at the American Music Awards of 2022,[71] Song of the Year and Best Lyrics at the 2022 iHeartRadio Music Awards,[72] the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically,[73] and the MTV Video Music Award for Song of the Year.[74]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\nUpon release, \"Easy on Me\" achieved success on streaming platforms. It became the most streamed song on Spotify, both in a day[d] and a single week.[e][77] In the United Kingdom, \"Easy on Me\" opened with 3.2 million Spotify streams, the most received by any song in a day.[77] It also broke the record for the most streamed song in a single week in the country, with 24 million streams.[78] On Amazon Music, it earned the most first-day streams globally and the most first-day Alexa requests for any song in the platform's history.[79] \"Easy on Me\" debuted at number 195 on the *Billboard* Global 200 with just five hours of tracking and became Adele's first song to reach the chart's summit the following week. That week, it sold 136,300 downloads, the third-largest sales week for any song on that chart, and earned 178.2 million streams, the second-largest streaming week. It also became the second number one song in history to double the chart points of the number two.[80]\n\n\nIn the United States, \"Easy on Me\" debuted at number 68 on the *Billboard* Hot 100 with its first five hours of tracking.[81] The following week, it became Adele's fifth chart-topping single. It also debuted at number one on the Digital Song Sales and Streaming Songs charts, and number four on Radio Songs where it earned the highest debut ever.[82] \"Easy on Me\" recorded the most first-week plays among all songs in US radio history and became the first to be most-added on five radio formats in a single week.[83] *Billboard* named it one of the biggest number one singles \"of the last 30 years\".[84] The song reached number one on the *Billboard* Adult Contemporary airplay chart, becoming Adele's sixth leader on the list and had the quickest trajectory to number one for a non-holiday song since \"Hello\".[85] During its sixth week on the Hot 100, Adele earned simultaneous top-five placements with \"Easy on Me\" at number one and \"Oh My God\" debuting at number five.[86] \"Easy on Me\" stayed at number one for ten weeks, tying \"Hello\" as Adele's longest-running number one song on the Hot 100.[87] In its fourteenth week, \"Easy on Me\" became the first song to surpass 100 million in radio reach since the Weeknd's \"Blinding Lights\" (2019) one and a half year earlier.[88] The Recording Industry Association of America certified it 4× Platinum in November 2022.[89]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Easy on Me\" debuted at number one on the Official Singles Chart on the chart issued for 28 October 2021. With 217,300 units, it marked the highest first week sales for any song since 2017.[78] \"Easy on Me\" spent eight nonconsecutive weeks at number one, becoming her longest-running number one single in the UK.[90][91] The British Phonographic Industry certified it 3× Platinum in June 2023.[92] \"Easy on Me\" debuted atop Australia's ARIA Singles Chart, becoming her third song to reach the position.[93] It spent four weeks at the summit and received a 6× Platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association.[94][95] In Canada, \"Easy on Me\" spent eight weeks at number one on the Canadian Hot 100.[96] Music Canada certified it 3× Platinum in January 2022.[97] Elsewhere, \"Easy on Me\" reached number one in Austria,[98] Belgium,[99] Costa Rica,[100] Croatia,[101] Czech Republic,[102] Denmark,[103] Germany,[104] Iceland,[105] Ireland,[106] Israel,[107] Italy,[108] Lithuania,[109] Malaysia,[110] the Netherlands,[111] New Zealand,[112] Norway,[113] Singapore,[114] Slovakia,[115] South Africa,[116] Sweden,[117] and Switzerland.[118] The song was certified 2× Diamond in Brazil,[119] Diamond in France,[120] 3× Platinum in Portugal and Switzerland,[121][122] 2× Platinum in Denmark,[123] Italy,[124] Mexico,[125] New Zealand,[126] Poland,[127] and Sweden,[128] Platinum in Belgium,[129] Germany,[130] Spain,[119] and Greece,[131] and Gold in Austria.[132]\n\n\n\n## Music video[edit]\n\n\nXavier Dolan, who had previously directed the music video for \"Hello\", also directed the one for \"Easy on Me\". The latter was filmed in the same house as \"Hello\", at the Chemin Jordan and Domaine Dumont Chapelle Ste-Agnès in Sutton, Quebec, on 15 and 16 September 2021.[133][134][135] The video starts black-and-white before changing to full colour midway. According to Camp, it \"picks up where 'Hello' left off\".[26] Adele gazes across the empty house and outside the window before packing up her belongings, putting on sunglasses, and moving out.[135][136] She talks with someone on a mobile phone[137][138] and inserts a cassette into the tape deck of a furniture truck, which plays \"Easy on Me\".[46][139] Adele mourns the end of her own marriage while driving away and spectating a separate couple's engagement celebration as several pages of sheet music fly out of the car's windows.[46][135][140]\n\n\nThe video was released on 15 October 2021 at midnight UK time to 200,000 viewers during the premiere. It reached 12 million views within 12 hours and 90 million within six days of release.[136][140] Several critics thought it referenced other Adele music videos, including \"Hello\", \"Rolling in the Deep\" (2010), and \"Chasing Pavements\" (2008).[140][138][137] *Parade*'s Rose Maura Lorre described it as a sequel to \"Hello\" and compared a chair in it to the one in the \"Rolling in the Deep\" music video.[138] Sophia McFarland of *The Spokesman-Review* believed it was \"a cinematic masterpiece in itself\".[140] BBC News' Mark Savage opined that the transition from black and white to colours represented \"the sound of a woman who has dismantled her entire world, realising that she needn't feel guilty for putting herself first\".[141] A video of bloopers from the production of the music video was released on 4 November 2021.[139]\n\n\n\n## Live performances and cover versions[edit]\n\n\nAdele performed \"Easy on Me\" live for the first time during her CBS special *Adele One Night Only* (2021).[142] She reprised the song at the 23rd NRJ Music Awards on 20 November 2021.[143] Adele hit an incorrect note during her first attempt at singing it for her ITV special *An Audience with Adele* (2021) and restarted the performance: \"I'm shitting myself.\"[144] She performed \"Easy on Me\" during her British Summer Time concerts on 1 and 2 July 2022.[145] Adele included the song in the set list for Weekends with Adele, her 2022–2023 concert residency.[146][147] She wore a full-length black gown and sang afront a coral green backdrop. Reviewing the show on 18 November 2022, *The New York Times*' Lindsay Zoladz believed Adele seemed nervous and \"relied a bit too heavily on encouraging the crowd to sing her lyrics\", and *Harper's Bazaar*'s Bianca Betancourt thought she \"appeared visibly emotional\" before it.[148][149][150]\n\n\nSeveral artists recorded cover versions of \"Easy on Me\". Kanye West and the Sunday Service Choir performed a cover with changed lyrics, as a tribute to Virgil Abloh after he died on 28 November 2021.[151][152] Chloe Bailey uploaded a cover of the song on 9 December 2021, which included whistle tones and vocal runs; *Uproxx*'s Wongo Okon commented that she sang the challenging song without any problems.[153][154] On 4 January 2022, Travis Barker released a cover, on which he played the drums[155][156] and guitar[157] and transformed it into a rock ballad.[158] The Vitamin String Quartet, whose violin player Leah Zeger had accompanied Adele during the *One Night Only* performance, released a version of \"Easy on Me\" with string instruments on 4 March 2022.[159] Keith Urban introduced his acoustic guitar cover of the song during a March 2022 show: \"I would like to make a special dedication tonight, to somebody I just absolutely adore as a performer, as a songwriter, a trailblazer, [...] We love you Adele, oh yes we do.\"[160][161] In July 2023, 13-year-old musician Nandi Bushell shared her cover of it; she noted in the caption that it was her first video singing and playing piano simultaneously.[162][163][164] \"Easy on Me\" has also been covered by contestants on *The Voice*.[165][166][167]\n\n\n\n## Credits and personnel[edit]\n\n\nCredits are adapted from the liner notes of *30*.[9]\n\n\n\n* Greg Kurstin – producer,
