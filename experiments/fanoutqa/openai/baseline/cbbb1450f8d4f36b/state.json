In 2010, vehicle sales in China by GM rose 28.8% to a record 2,351,610 units.[180] The top two markets in 2011 were China, with 2,547,203 units, and the United States, with 2,503,820 vehicles sold. The Chevrolet brand was the main contributor to GM performance, with 4.76 million vehicles sold around the world in 2011, a global sales record.[181]\n\n\nBased on global sales in 2012, General Motors was ranked among the world's largest automakers.[182]\n\n\nIn May 2012, GM recorded an 18.4% market share in the U.S. with stock imported.[183]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nToday, General Motors remains a successful company, ranking 25th by total revenue out of all American companies on the *Fortune 500* and 50th on the *Fortune Global 500*.[13][14] The company is presently heavily pursuing electric vehicles, as GM announced plans in January 2021 to end production and sales of vehicles using internal combustion engines, including hybrid vehicles and plug-in hybrids, by 2035, as part of its plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of General Motors\n\n### Founding and consolidation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Origin\n | Brand[175] | Founded\n | Began manufacturing vehicles\n | Joined GM\n | Markets served today\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Buick | 1899 | 1903 | 1908 | China, North America\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Cadillac | 1902 | 1902 | 1909 | North America, Middle East, China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, Kazakhstan\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | Chevrolet | 1911 | 1911 | 1918 | Americas, China, Middle East, CIS, South Korea, Philippines, Japan, Europe, Australasia.\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0US | GMC | 1912 | 1912 | 1919 | North America, Middle East, South Korea\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CHN | Baojun | 2010 | 2010 | 2010 | China\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0CHN | Wuling | 2002 | 2002 | 2002 | China, Indonesia\n |\n\n\n### Former[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Department of State, Division of Corporations (General Information Name Search)\".

It acquired the remaining 20% in 1931.[35]\n\n\nIn the late-1920s, Charles Kettering embarked on a program to develop a lightweight two-stroke diesel engine for possible usage in automobiles.[40] Soon after, GM acquired Electro-Motive Company and the Winton Engine Co., and in 1941, it expanded EMC's realm to locomotive engine manufacturing.[41]\n\n\nIn 1932, GM acquired Packard Electric[17][42] (not the Packard car company, which merged with Studebaker years later).

An existing GM facility at Brownstown Township was chosen to be upgraded as a battery pack plant.[134] LG Chem's U.S. subsidiary, Compact Power of Troy, Michigan, has been building the prototype packs for the development vehicles and will continue to provide integration support and acting as a liaison for the program.[160]\n\n\n\n### Motorsports history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chevrolet Corvette C8.R in the IMSA SportsCar Championship\nGM participated in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) from 2004 to 2012,[161] and has also participated in other motorsport championships, including 24 Hours of Le Mans,[162] NASCAR,[163] SCCA[164] and Supercars Championship.[165]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1939, the company founded Motors Insurance Corporation and entered the vehicle insurance market.[27] The same year, GM introduced the Hydramatic, the first affordable and successful automatic transmission, for the 1940 Oldsmobile.[47][48]\n\n\n\n* ![1926 Pontiac radiator logo](image)\n\n1926 Pontiac radiator logo\n* ![1928 Pontiac Series 6-28 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan](image)\n\n1928 Pontiac Series 6-28 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan\n* ![1932 Pontiac Series 402 Six 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan](image)\n\n1932 Pontiac Series 402 Six 2-door 5-passenger Coach sedan\n* ![1936 Pontiac Master Six Series 6BB Coupe](image)\n\n1936 Pontiac Master Six Series 6BB Coupe\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGM's engines were successful in the Indy Racing League (IRL) throughout the 1990s, winning many races in the small V8 class. GM has also done much work in the development of electronics for GM auto racing. An unmodified Aurora V8 in the Aerotech captured 47 world records, including the record for speed endurance in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. Recently, the Cadillac V-Series has entered motorsports racing.\n\n\nGM has also designed cars specifically for use in NASCAR auto racing. The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is the only entry in the series.[166] In the past, the Pontiac Grand Prix,[167] Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Malibu, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Chevrolet Impala, and the Chevrolet SS were also used. GM has won many NASCAR Cup Series manufacturer's championships, including 40 with Chevrolet,[168] the most of any make in NASCAR history, 3 with Oldsmobile, 2 with Buick, and 1 with Pontiac. In 2021, Chevrolet became the first brand to reach 800 wins.[169]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ Ignition switch recalls\n\t+ Motors Liquidation Company\n\t+ Motorama\n\t+ Reorganization\n\t+ Streetcar conspiracy\n\t+ 1945\u201346 strike\n\t+ 2007 strike\n\t+ 2019 strike\n* Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle\n* *Concept of the Corporation*\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAutomotive brands of General Motors\n |\n| --- |\n| Wholly owned | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a continuation of its diversification plans, GMAC formed GMAC Mortgage and acquired Colonial Mortgage as well as the servicing arm of Norwest Mortgage in 1985. This acquisition included an $11 billion mortgage portfolio.[75] The same year, GM acquired the Hughes Aircraft Company for $5 billion in cash and stock and merged it into Delco Electronics.[76] The following year, GM acquired 59.7% of Lotus Cars, a British producer of high-performance sports cars.[77]\n\n\nIn 1987, in conjunction with AeroVironment, GM built the Sunraycer, which won the inaugural World Solar Challenge and was a showcase of advanced technology. Much of the technology from Sunraycer found its way into the Impact prototype electric vehicle (also built by Aerovironment) and was the predecessor to the General Motors EV1.[78]\n\n\nIn 1988, GM acquired a 15% stake in AeroVironment.[79]\n\n\nIn 1989, GM acquired half of Saab Automobile's car operations for $600 million.[80]\n\n\n\n### Sales of assets[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The company designs, manufactures, and distributes passenger and commercial vehicles, motorcycles, engines and turbomachinery, as well as offers related services, including financing, leasing, and fleet management. In 2016, it was the world's largest automaker by sales, and keeping this title in 2017, 2018, and 2019, selling 10.9 million vehicles.[7] It has maintained the largest market share in Europe for over two decades.[8] It ranked seventh in the 2020 *Fortune* Global 500 list of the world's largest companies.[9]\n\n\nThe Volkswagen Group sells passenger cars under the Audi, Bentley, Cupra, Jetta, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, \u0160koda and Volkswagen brands, motorcycles under the Ducati name, light commercial vehicles under the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand, and heavy commercial vehicles via the marques of the listed subsidiary Traton (Navistar, MAN, Scania and Volkswagen Truck & Bus). It is divided into two primary divisions: the Automotive Division and the Financial Services Division. As of 2008, it had about 342 subsidiary companies.[10] Volkswagen also has three joint ventures in China, FAW-Volkswagen, SAIC Volkswagen and Volkswagen Anhui.Audi The company has operations in roughly 150 countries, and it has 100 production facilities across 27 countries.\n\n\nVolkswagen was founded in Berlin in 1937 and incorporated in Wolfsburg to manufacture the car that would become known as the Beetle. The company's production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1965, it acquired Auto Union, which subsequently produced the first postwar Audi models. Volkswagen launched a new generation of front-wheel drive vehicles in the 1970s, including the Passat, Polo and Golf; the last became its bestseller. Volkswagen acquired a controlling stake in SEAT in 1986, making it the first non-German marque of the company, and acquired control of \u0160koda in 1994, of Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti in 1998, Scania in 2008 and of Ducati, MAN, and Porsche in 2012. The company's operations in China have grown rapidly in the past decade, with the country becoming its largest market.\n\n\nVolkswagen Aktiengesellschaft is a public company and has a primary listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index, and a secondary listings on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and SIX Swiss Exchange. It has been traded in the United States via American depositary receipts since 1988, currently on the OTC Marketplace. Volkswagen delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2013.[11][12] The government of Lower Saxony holds 12.7% of the company's shares, granting it, by law, 20% of the voting rights.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)26 May 1938: Laying the foundation stone of the first Volkswagen plant by Adolf Hitler: In the front right is Ferdinand Porsche.\n### 1937 to 1945[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen (meaning 'People's car' in German) was founded in Berlin as the *Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH* ('Limited Liability Company for the preparation of the German People's Car', abbreviated to *Gezuvor*) by the National Socialist *Deutsche Arbeitsfront* (German Labour Front) and incorporated on 28 May 1937.[14][15][16] The purpose of the company was to manufacture the Volkswagen car, originally referred to as the Porsche Type 60, then the Volkswagen Type 1, and commonly called the Volkswagen Beetle.[17] This vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Porsche's consulting firm, and the company was backed by the support of Adolf Hitler.[18] On 16 September 1938, Gezuvor was renamed *Volkswagenwerk GmbH* ('Volkswagen Factory GmbH').[14]\n\n\nShortly after the factory near Fallersleben was completed, World War II started, and the plant primarily manufactured the military K\u00fcbelwagen (Porsche Type 82) and the related amphibious Schwimmwagen (Type 166), both of which were derived from the Volkswagen. Only a small number of Type 60 Volkswagens were made during this time. The Fallersleben plant also manufactured the V-1 flying bomb, making the plant a major bombing target for the Allied forces.\n\n\n\n### 1945 to 1970[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1951 Volkswagen Beetle\nAfter the war in Europe, in June 1945, Major Ivan Hirst[17] of the British Army Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) took control of the bomb-shattered factory for use in repairing British Army vehicles, pending the expected disposal of the plant tooling and equipment as war reparations. However, no British car manufacturer was interested. A British report on the car said that \"the vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirement of a motor-car \u2026 it is quite unattractive to the average buyer \u2026 To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise.\"[19] In 1948, the Ford Motor Company of USA was offered Volkswagen, but Ernest Breech, a Ford executive vice president, said he did not think either the plant or the car was \"worth a damn.\"[20] Breech later said that he would have considered merging Ford of Germany and Volkswagen, but after the war, ownership of the company was in such dispute that nobody could possibly hope to be able to take it over. As part of the Industrial plans for Germany, large parts of German industry, including Volkswagen, were to be dismantled. Total German car production was set at a maximum of 10% of the 1936 car production numbers.[21] The company survived by producing cars for the British Army, and in 1948 the British Government handed the company back over to the German state, and it was managed by former Opel chief Heinrich Nordhoff.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Audi F103, in production from 1965 to 1972\nProduction of the Type 60 Volkswagen (re-designated Type 1) started slowly after the war due to the need to rebuild the plant and because of the lack of raw materials, but production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. The company began introducing new models based on the Type 1, all with the same basic air-cooled, rear-engine, rear-drive platform. These included the Volkswagen Type 2 in 1950, the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia in 1955, the Volkswagen Type 3 in 1961, the Volkswagen Type 4 in 1968, and the Volkswagen Type 181 in 1969.\n\n\nIn 1960, upon the flotation of part of the German federal government's stake in the company on the German stock market, its name became *Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft* (usually abbreviated to *Volkswagenwerk AG*).\n\n\nOn 1 January 1965, Volkswagenwerk acquired Auto Union GmbH from its parent company Daimler-Benz. The new subsidiary went on to produce the first post-war Audi models, the Audi F103 series, shortly afterwards.[22]\n\n\nAnother German manufacturer, NSU Motorenwerke AG, was merged into Auto Union on 26 August 1969, creating a new company, Audi NSU Auto Union AG (later renamed AUDI AG in 1985).[22]\n\n\n\n### 1970 to 1999[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Volkswagen Golf Mk1 - the Golf is the third-bestselling car of all time, selling over 30 million up to 2013.\nFrom the late 1970s to 1992, the acronym **V.A.G.** was used by Volkswagen AG as a brand for group-wide activities, such as distribution and leasing. Contrary to popular belief, \"V.A.G.\" had no official meaning, and was never the formal name of the Volkswagen Group.[23]\n\n\nOn 30 September 1982, Volkswagenwerk made its first step expanding outside Germany by signing a co-operation agreement with the Spanish car manufacturer SEAT, S.A.[22]\n\n\nTo reflect the company's increasing global diversification from its headquarters and main plant (the *Volkswagenwerk* in Wolfsburg), on 4 July 1985, the company name was changed again\u2014to *Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft* (Volkswagen AG).\n\n\nOn 18 June 1986, Volkswagen AG acquired a 51% controlling stake in SEAT, making it the first non-German subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group. On 23 December the same year, it became the Spanish company's major shareholder by increasing its share up to 75%.[22]\n\n\nIn 1990\u2014after purchasing its entire equity\u2014Volkswagen AG took over the full ownership of SEAT, making the company a wholly owned subsidiary, and on 28 March 1991, another step to the expansion of the group's activities was made through the signing of a joint-venture partnership agreement with \u0160koda automobilov\u00e1 a.s. of Czechoslovakia, accompanied with the acquisition of a 30% stake in the Czech car manufacturer on 16 April 1991.[22]\n\n\nOn 19 December 1994, the group began the acquisition of \u0160koda Auto by raising its share to 60.3%. Later, on 11 December 1995, it became the Czech company's largest and controlling shareholder by increasing its share up to 70%.[24]\n\n\nThree prestige automotive marques were added to the Volkswagen portfolio in 1998: Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti.[22]\n\n\n\n### 2000 to present[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The \u0160koda Superb B6, in production from 2008 to 2015\nOn 30 May 2000, after having gradually raised its equity share, Volkswagen AG took over the full ownership of \u0160koda Auto, making the company a wholly owned subsidiary.[22]\n\n\nFrom 2002 up to 2007, the Volkswagen Group's automotive division was restructured so that two major Brand Groups with different profile would be formed,[25] the *Audi Brand Group* focused on more sporty values\u00a0\u2013 consisted of Audi, SEAT and Lamborghini\u00a0\u2013 and the *Volkswagen Brand Group* on the field of classic values\u00a0\u2013 consisted of Volkswagen, Skoda, Bentley and Bugatti[26][27]\u00a0\u2013 with each Brand Group's product vehicles and performance being respectively under the higher responsibility of Audi and Volkswagen brands.\n\n\nVolkswagen Group revealed on 24 October 2009 that it had made an offer to acquire long-time partner and German niche automotive manufacturer Wilhelm Karmann GmbH out of bankruptcy protection.[28] In November 2009, the supervisory board of Volkswagen AG approved the acquisition of assets of Karmann, and planned to restart vehicle production at their Osnabr\u00fcck plant in 2012.[29]\n\n\nIn December 2009, Volkswagen AG bought a 49.9% stake in Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG (more commonly known as Porsche AG) in a first step towards an 'integrated automotive group' with Porsche.[30][31][32] The merger of Volkswagen AG and Porsche SE was scheduled to take place during the course of 2011. On 8 September 2011, it was announced that the planned merger \"cannot be implemented within the time frame provided for in the Comprehensive Agreement\". As reasons, unquantifiable legal risks, including a criminal probe into the holding's former management team were given. Both parties \"remain committed to the goal of creating an integrated automotive group with Porsche and are convinced that this will take place\".[33][34]\n\n\nOn 4 July 2012 Volkswagen group announced they would wrap up the remaining half of Porsche shares for 4.46 billion euros (US$5.58 billion) on 1 August 2012 to avoid taxes of as much as 1.5 billion euros, which would have to be paid if the wrap up happened after 31 July 2014.[35] Volkswagen AG purchased the remaining stake in Porsche AG equaling 100% of the shares in Porsche Zwischenholding GmbH, effectively becoming its parent company as of 1 August 2012.[36]\n\n\nVolkswagen AG completed the purchase of 19.9% of Suzuki Motor Corporation's issued shares on 15 January 2010.[37][38] Suzuki invested part of the amount received from Volkswagen into 1.49% percent of Volkswagen.[39] In 2011, Suzuki filed a lawsuit at an arbitration court in London requesting that Volkswagen return the 19.9% stake.[40]\n\n\nOn 25 May 2010, it was announced that Volkswagen Group, through it subsidiary Lamborghini Holding S.p.A., had acquired a 90.1% stake in the Italian automotive design house Italdesign Giugiaro.[41]\nIn less than three months, the transaction had been completed making the Italian firm a member of the Volkswagen Group.[42] Since 2013 the Volkswagen Group has held a 89.7% stake in Traton.\n\n\nIn 2015 research showed a security flaw in the keyless ignition of Volkswagen and other carmakers' vehicles. Volkswagen spent two years trying to keep the research from the public domain.[43][*undue weight? \u2013 discuss*]\n\n\nOn 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of three German automakers\u2014BMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen Group, for \u20ac2.8 billion.[44] This was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars.\n\n\nVolkswagen held a 19.9% non-controlling shareholding in Suzuki between 2009 and 2015. An international arbitration court ordered Volkswagen to sell the stake back to Suzuki.[45] On 17 September 2015, Suzuki paid $3.8bn to complete the stock buy-back just hours prior to a major scandal about emissions violations engulfing Volkswagen. Suzuki had wished to buy Fiat diesel engines.[46]\n\n\nBugatti left the Volkswagen Group in November 2021, when the company became part of Bugatti Rimac, a joint venture between Rimac Group and Porsche AG.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Emissions scandal, 2015[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volkswagen emissions scandal\n\nOn 18 September 2015, the US EPA announced that Volkswagen had installed a \"defeat device\" software code in the diesel models sold in the US from 2009 to 2015.[48] The code was intended to detect when an emissions test was being conducted, and altered emissions controls for better compliance. Off the test stand, the controls were relaxed, and emissions jumped 35 to 40 times regulatory levels according to investigators at West Virginia University and the California Air Resources Board. About 482,000 vehicles are under the recall order, a potential $18 billion ($37,500 per violation) in fines are pending, and news accounts speculate a criminal indictment for the deception is certain.[49][50] The VW Group CEO, Martin Winterkorn, said he was \"deeply sorry\" and ordered an external investigation.[51] The software code was only revealed when the EPA refused to certify VW's 2016 models for sale in the US unless the corporation provided full disclosure.[52] On Sunday, 20 September 2015, VW Group announced it was halting the sale of its four-cylinder diesel models in the US.[53] The US EPA press release on its Notice of Violation,[48] and the California Air Resources Board letter[54] dated 18 September 2015 contain significant chronological detail of the agencies interaction with VW on the issue.\n\n\nOn 22 September 2015, VW AG admitted that 11 million cars worldwide had been fitted with software intended to deceive emissions testing. The company issued a profit warning, saying it had set aside $7 billion to fix the fraud.[55] On 23 September 2015, Martin Winterkorn announced his resignation from the CEO position after a crisis meeting of the company board.[56] On 25 September 2015 Matthias M\u00fcller was named CEO.[57] M\u00fcller was the head of the Porsche marque within the VW corporate umbrella.[58]\n\n\nOn 21 April 2017, a U.S. federal judge ordered Volkswagen \"to pay a $2.8 billion criminal fine for rigging diesel-powered vehicles to cheat on government emissions tests\". The \"unprecedented\" plea deal formalized a punishment that Volkswagen AG agreed to earlier in 2017.[59] In addition, the plea deal includes a $1.5 billion settlement for various environmental, customs and financial violations.[60]\n\n\nOverall, Volkswagen will pay more than $30 billion in penalties and lawsuit settlements related to the scandal.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Electrification strategy 2025[edit]\n\n\n![](image)VW Group has invested in a wide-ranging electrification strategy in Europe, North America and China, with its electric \"MEB\" platform.\nIn 2016, Volkswagen Group announced a corporate \"Strategy 2025\" that focuses on electrification of its portfolio.[62] The VW Group developed the Volkswagen Group MEB platform chassis that will be utilized in a range of various cars and light utility vehicles across several VW Group marques due to its flexibility and floor-mounted battery.[63]\n\n\nAs of May 2018, the VW Group has committed $48 billion in car battery supplies[64] and plans to outfit 16 factories to build electric cars by the end of 2022.[65] According to VW Group CEO Dr. Herbert Diess, the company will offer 25 electric models and 20 plug-in hybrids by 2020.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Production in Xinjiang[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen Group came under pressure for cooperating with the Chinese government in the region of Xinjiang. In that same region, western-funded NGOs accused the Chinese government of having committed human rights abuses against the Uighur minority group, which included mass surveillance, incarceration, and forced labor. After these accusations emerged, Volkswagen responded, \"We do not assume any of our employees are forced laborers.\"[66] *S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung* claimed that Volkswagen was operating a plant in Xinjiang at a loss in order to curry favor with the Chinese government to set up more lucrative plants in other parts of China, which Volkswagen denied, saying that the decision to set up the plant in 2012 was purely based on economics.[66] Volkswagen is still operating a plant in the region as of 2020.[67]\n\n\n\n#### New Auto[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Volkswagen Group released their *New Auto* strategy. The strategy was based on transitioning to electric cars, and building a shared platform, battery systems, software and mobility solutions to use across all their brands.[68][69] This involves creating the Scalable Systems Platform, as well as developing software under a new subsidiary called *CARIAD*.[68][69] Volkswagen Group aims by 2024 to transition to selling mostly electric cars.[70] It aims to have six battery factories in Europe by 2030.[70]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2018, Volkswagen reported earnings of \u20ac13.920 billion, with an annual revenue of \u20ac235.849 billion, an increase of 2.2% over the previous fiscal cycle. Volkswagen's shares traded at over \u20ac148 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at US$73.8 billion in November 2018.[71]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenuein bn.

From July 1998 until December 2002, BMW continued to supply engines for the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph and the Bentley division sold cars under both the Bentley and Rolls-Royce marques, under an agreement with BMW. In January 2022, Bentley became part of the Audi Group.[79]\n\n\n![](image)Porsche headquarters in Stuttgart\n* Dr. Ing. h.c.

Analysts disagreed as to whether the investment was a good fit for Porsche's strategy.[89]\n\n\nOn 26 March 2007, after the European Union moved against the Volkswagen law, Porsche took its holding to 30.9\u00a0percent, triggering a takeover bid under German law. Porsche formally announced in a press statement that it did not intend to take over Volkswagen Group, setting its offer price at the lowest possible legal value, but intended the move to avoid a competitor taking a large stake, or to stop hedge funds dismantling Volkswagen Group, which is Porsche's most important partner.[90]\nOn 16 September 2008, Porsche announced that the company had increased its stake in Volkswagen AG to 35\u00a0percent.[91] By October 2008, Porsche held 42.6\u00a0percent of Volkswagen AG's ordinary shares, and held stock options on another 31.5\u00a0percent.[92] thus, effectively holding over 74\u00a0percent; 42.6\u00a0percent actual shares, and the rest as convertible options.[93] Volkswagen AG briefly became the world's most valuable company, as the stock price rose to over \u20ac1,000 per share as short sellers tried to cover their positions.[94] The substantial investment in Volkswagen left Porsche with huge financial burden with its debts accumulating up to 13 billion euros by 2009.[95] Porsche would get emergency infusion of about a billion dollars from Volkswagen.[96] In July 2012, Volkswagen completed takeover of Porsche ending the 4 year saga and formed an integrated automotive group with Porsche. Porsche AG would become the 10th brand of Volkswagen. The holding company Porsche SE was left with 31 percent of the subscribed capital of Volkswagen AG, and 50.7 percent of the voting rights in the company.[97]\n\n\nAs of 31\u00a0December\u00a02020[update], share ownership of Volkswagen AG is distributed as follows:[98]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nSubscribed capital:\n| Percentage | Shareholder name\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 31.4% | Porsche Automobil Holding SE |\n| 25.9% | Foreign institutional investors |\n| 14.6% | Qatar Holding LLC |\n| 11.8% | State of Lower Saxony |\n| 12.9% | Private shareholders / Others\n |\n| 3.4% | German institutional investors\n |\n\n | \n\nVoting rights:\n| Percentage | Shareholder name\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 53.3% | Porsche Automobil Holding SE |\n| 20.0% | State of Lower Saxony |\n| 17.0% | Qatar Holding LLC |\n| 9.7% | Others\n |\n\n\n |\n\n### Stock market listings[edit]\n\n\nVolkswagen AG shares are primarily traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange,[99] and are listed under the 'VOW' and 'VOW3' stock ticker symbols. First listed in August 1961, the shares were issued at a price of DM\u00a0350 per DM\u00a0100 share,[99] Volkswagen AG shares are now separated into two different types or classes: 'ordinary shares' and 'preference shares'.[99] The ordinary shares are now traded under the WKN\u00a0766400 and ISIN DE0007664005 listings, and the preference shares under the WKN\u00a0766403 and ISIN DE0007664039 listings.[99]\n\n\nVolkswagen AG shares are also listed and traded on other major domestic and worldwide stock exchanges. In Germany's domestic exchanges, since 1961 these include those in Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich and Stuttgart. International exchanges include those in Basel (listed in 1967), Geneva (1967), Z\u00fcrich (1967), Luxembourg (1979), London (1988), and New York (1988).[99]\n\n\nSince the start of trading in 1961, Volkswagen AG shares have been subjected to two stock splits\u00a0\u2013 the first was on 17 March 1969 when they were split at a ratio of 2:1, from a DM\u00a0100 share to a DM\u00a050 share. The second split occurred on 6 July 1998, the DM\u00a050 share being converted into a share of no overall nominal value, at a ratio of 1:10.[99]\n\n\nFrom 23 December 2009, Volkswagen AG preferred shares replaced its ordinary shares in the DAX index.[100]\n\n\n\n### Leadership, sales and market share[edit]\n\n\n\n\nVolkswagen (mbH, GmbH, AG) leaders\n| Tenure | Leader(s)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1937 to 1945 | Bodo Lafferentz, Ferdinand Porsche, Jakob Werlin[101] |\n| June 1945 to December 1947 | Ivan Hirst (Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers)[17] |\n| 1 January 1948 to April 1967 | Heinrich Nordhoff[102] |\n| 1 May 1968 to September 1971 | Kurt Lotz[102] |\n| 1 October 1971 to February 1975 | Rudolf Leiding[102] |\n| 10 February 1975 to December 1980 | Toni Schm\u00fccker[102] |\n| 1 January 1982 to December 1992 | Carl Hahn[102] |\n| 1 January 1993 to 16 April 2002 | Ferdinand K.

That year, Hyundai set a record of selling the most automobiles in its first year of business in the United States compared to any other car brand; total sales in 1986 were 168,882.[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The world's largest automobile manufacturing plant in Ulsan, South Korea, produces over 1.6\u00a0million vehicles annually.In 1998, after a shake-up in the South Korean auto industry caused by overambitious expansion and the Asian financial crisis, Hyundai acquired the majority of rival Kia Motors.[35]\n\n\nIn 2000, the company established a strategic alliance with DaimlerChrysler and severed its partnership with the Hyundai Group. In 2001, the Daimler-Hyundai Truck Corporation was formed. In 2004, however, DaimlerChrysler divested its interest in the company by selling its 10.5% stake for $900\u00a0million.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHyundai operates the world's largest integrated automobile manufacturing facility in Ulsan, South Korea which has an annual production capacity of 1.6\u00a0million units.[9] The company employs about 75,000 people worldwide. Hyundai vehicles are sold in 193 countries through 5,000 dealerships and showrooms.[10] As of 2022, Hyundai is the world's third-largest carmaker in terms of production, behind Toyota and Volkswagen.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Hyundai Motor America headquarters in Fountain Valley, California\nHyundai has invested in manufacturing plants in North America, India, the Czech Republic, Russia, China and Turkey as well as research and development centers in Europe, Asia, North America and the Pacific Rim. In 2004, Hyundai Motor Company had $57.2\u00a0billion in sales in South Korea making it the country's second largest corporation, or chaebol, after Samsung. Worldwide sales in 2005 reached 2,533,695 units, an 11 percent increase over the previous year. In 2011, Hyundai sold 4.05 million cars worldwide and the Hyundai Motor Group was the world's fourth largest automaker behind GM, Volkswagen and Toyota.[36][37] Hyundai vehicles are sold in 193 countries through some 5,000 dealerships.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n115. **^** Siregar, Efrem. \"Di Depan Jokowi, Hyundai Siap Bangun Pabrik Mobil Rp 21 T\". *news* (in Indonesian).

The new plant in Montgomery, Alabama, was completed during 2004, at a cost of $1.7\u00a0billion. Production started in May 2005. It employed more than 3,000 workers in 2012.[52]\n\n\nBy 2004, sales had dramatically increased, and the reputation of Hyundai cars improved. In 2004, Hyundai tied with Honda for initial brand quality in a survey/study from J.D. Power and Associates, for having 102 problems per 1000 vehicles. This made Hyundai second in the industry, only behind Toyota, for initial vehicle quality. The company continued this tradition by placing third overall in J.D.

Power and Associates in North America.[22][23] Hyundai is now one of the top 100 most valuable brands worldwide according to Interbrand.[24] Since 2002, Hyundai has also been one of the worldwide official sponsors of the FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHyundai formed a 50-50 joint venture with Beijing Automotive Group since 2002 to produce cars in China.[77] The joint venture is called Beijing Hyundai, which also manufactures several models which are exclusive to the Chinese market.[78] It began operations in China by producing Sonata in December 2002.[79]\nThe joint venture sold 700,000 passenger cars in 2010, 855,995 car sales in 2012, and 2014 saw the company sell 1,120,000 vehicles.[80][81][82] Currently, the company operates five plants, three which is located in Beijing, one in Hubei, and another in Chongqing.[83]\n\n\n\n##### Hawtai partnership[edit]\n\n\nBetween 2002 and 2010,[84][85] Hawtai Motor had produced Chinese-market versions of the Hyundai Matrix,[86] the Hyundai Santa Fe[84][87] and the Hyundai Terracan.[84][87] The Santa Fe was the fifth most-purchased SUV in China in 2010,[88] and some of Hawtai's versions may greatly differ from those sold in other markets.[89] Hyundai ended its partnership with Hawtai in 2010.[90]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2004, Hyundai America Technical Center completed construction of its Hyundai/Kia proving ground in California City, California. The 4,300-acre (17\u00a0km2) facility is located in the Mojave Desert and features a 6.4-mile (10.3\u00a0km) oval track,[9] a Vehicle Dynamics Area, a vehicle-handling course inside the oval track, a paved hill road, and several special surface roads. A 30,000-square-foot (2,800\u00a0m2) complex featuring offices and indoor testing areas is located on the premises as well. The facility was built at a cost of $50\u00a0million.\n\n\nIn the 2021 review of WIPO's annual World Intellectual Property Indicators Hyundai ranked as 4th in the world for its 141 industrial design registrations being published under the Hague System during 2020.[32] This position is up on their previous 7th-place ranking for 57 industrial design registrations being published in 2019.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Business[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hyundai Motor Group\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Divisions | * Genesis\n* Ioniq\n |\n| Subsidiaries | List\n\n* Hyundai Motor IndiaHyundai Motors IndonesiaHyundai Motor AmericaHyundai of CanadaHyundai Motor of South AmericaHyundai do BrasilHyundai ChinaBeijing HyundaiHyundai JapanHyundai Motor PhilippinesHyundai Motor Europe\n |\n|  |\n| Korean name |\n| Hangul | \ud604\ub300\uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \uc8fc\uc2dd\ud68c\uc0ac\n |\n| Hanja | \u73fe\u4ee3\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca \u682a\u5f0f\u6703\u793e\n |\n| Revised Romanization | *Hyeondae Jadongcha Jusikhoesa* |\n| McCune\u2013Reischauer | *Hy\u014fndae Chadongch'a Chushikhoesa* |\n|  |\n| Website | hyundai.com |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n96. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Brogan, Matt (30 November 2009). \"Hyundai suspends Japanese sales\". *CarAdvice*.

It has been in continuous family control for over 100 years and is one of the largest family-controlled companies in the world.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe first gasoline-powered automobile had been created in 1885 by the German inventor Karl Benz (Benz Patent-Motorwagen). More efficient production methods were needed to make automobiles affordable for the middle class, to which Ford contributed by, for instance, introducing the first moving assembly line in 1913 at the Ford factory in Highland Park.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBritish car industry \u2013 companies and marques\n |\n| --- |\n| | Marque\n | 1900s\n | 1910s\n | 1920s\n | 1930s\n | 1940s\n | 1950s\n | 1960s\n | 1970s\n | 1980s\n | 1990s\n | 2000s\n | 2010s\n | 2020s\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8\n | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8\n | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8\n | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8\n | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8\n | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8\n | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8\n | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8\n | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8\n | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8\n | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8\n | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8\n | 0 | 2 | 4\n |\n| Rolls-Royce |  | Rolls-Royce Limited | Rolls-Royce Limited & Bentley | Rolls-Royce Motors | Rolls-Royce Motors (Vickers)\n | BMW & VW Group | BMW |\n| Bentley |  |  | Bentley | Volkswagen Group |\n| Armstrong Siddeley |  | Siddeley-Deasy | Armstrong Whitworth | Armstrong Siddeley | Bristol Siddeley | Rolls-Royce Limited | Armstrong Siddeley Owners Club |\n| Aston Martin |  |  | Aston Martin | Aston Martin Lagonda | Ford (PAG)\n | Aston Martin Lagonda |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Auto component makers and performance car modders | * Allison\n* American Expedition Vehicles\n* Aptiv\n* BFGoodrich\n* BorgWarner\n* Callaway Cars\n* Caterpillar\n* Cummins\n\t+ Brammo\n* Detroit Diesel\n* Eaton\n* Firestone\n* General Tire\n* Goodyear\n\t+ Cooper Tire & Rubber Company\n* Hennessey\n* Ingersoll Rand\n* Legacy\n* Lingenfelter\n* Nexteer\n* Phoenix Motorcars\n\t+ Proterra (bus manufacturer)\n* Remy International\n* Saleen\n* Shelby American\n* SRT\n* Timken\n* Torrington\n* Visteon\n |\n| Design studios | * Calty Design Research\n* Designworks\n* Rezvani Automotive Designs\n* Wheego Electric Cars\n |\n| By state | * Massachusetts\n |\n| Related topics | * AAA\n* Chicago Auto Show\n* Interstate Highway System\n* List of automobiles manufactured in the United States\n* National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\n* New York International Auto Show\n* North American International Auto Show\n* SAE International\n |\n| * 1 Non-U.S. based parent company that owns subsidiaries headquartered in U.S.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFord introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914, these methods were known around the world as Fordism.

The company has sold vehicles under a number of other marques during its history. The Mercury brand was introduced by Ford in 1939, continuing in production until 2011 when poor sales led to its discontinuation.[149] In 1958, Ford introduced the Edsel brand, but poor sales led to its discontinuation in 1960. In 1985, the Merkur brand was introduced in the United States to market products produced by Ford of Europe; it was discontinued in 1989.\n\n\nFord acquired the British sports car maker Aston Martin in 1989, later selling it on March 12, 2007,[150] although retaining an 8% stake.[151][152] Ford purchased Volvo Cars of Sweden in 1999,[153] selling it to Zhejiang Geely Holding Group in 2010.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Henry Ford Company was Henry Ford's first attempt at a car manufacturing company and was established on November 3, 1901. This became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name.[19] The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 (equivalent to $950,000 in 2023) in cash from twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company). The first president was not Ford, but local banker John S. Gray, who was chosen in order to assuage investors' fears that Ford would leave the new company the way he had left its predecessor. During its early years, the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later at its factory on Piquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** Leggett, Theo (March 6, 2005). \"Ford fighting to keep its shine\".

Hundreds or a few thousand of most of these were sold per year. In 1908, Ford introduced the mass-produced Model T, which totaled millions sold over nearly 20 years. In 1927, Ford replaced the T with the Model A, the first car with safety glass in the windshield.[20] Ford launched the first low-priced car with a V8 engine in 1932.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn an attempt to compete with General Motors' mid-priced Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick, Ford created the Mercury in 1939 as a higher-priced companion car to Ford. Henry Ford purchased the Lincoln Motor Company in 1922, in order to compete with such brands as Cadillac and Packard for the luxury segment of the automobile market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Marcos |  |  |  |  |  |  | Marcos |  | Marcos |  | Marcos |  |  |  |\n| Morgan |  | Morgan |\n| Napier | Napier |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Turner |  |  |  |  |  |  | Turner |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| TVR |  |  |  |  |  | TVR |\n| Westfield |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Westfield | Potenza Sports Cars |\n| GTM |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | GTM |\n| Vulcan |  | Vulcan |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Vauxhall |  | Vauxhall Motors | General Motors | General Motors Europe | Opel | Peugeot (PSA)\n | Stellantis |\n| Hillman |  | Hillman | Humber | Rootes | Chrysler Europe (Chrysler)\n | Peugeot (PSA)\n |\n| Humber | Humber |\n| Sunbeam | Sunbeam | S.T.D.

During the 1980s, Ford began using the advertising slogan, \"Have you driven a Ford, lately?\" to introduce new customers to their brand and make their vehicles appear more modern. In 1990 and 1994, respectively, Ford also acquired Jaguar Cars and Aston Martin.[28] During the mid-to-late 1990s, Ford continued to sell large numbers of vehicles, in a booming American economy with a soaring stock market and low fuel prices.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the dawn of the new century, legacy health care costs, higher fuel prices, and a faltering economy led to falling market shares, declining sales, and diminished profit margins. Most of the corporate profits came from financing consumer automobile loans through Ford Motor Credit Company.[29]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** \"Ford Motor Company / 2008 Annual Report, Operating Highlights\" (PDF). p.\u00a01.
