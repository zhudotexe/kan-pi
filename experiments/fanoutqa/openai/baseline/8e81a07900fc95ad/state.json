Brazil became the only team since Argentina in 1986 to win the trophy without needing to win a penalty shoot-out at some stage during the knockout phase and the total number of penalty shoot-outs (2) was the lowest since the four-round knockout format was introduced in 1986. Brazil also became the first team to win every match at a World Cup since 1970 and set a new record for highest aggregate goal difference (+14) for a World Cup winner. Brazil's captain Cafu, who became the first player to appear in three successive World Cup finals, accepted the trophy on behalf of the team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n40. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The FIFA World Cup Final Draw history\" (PDF).

The only other countries to have been awarded a World Cup without previously having competed in a final tournament are Italy in 1934 and Qatar in 2022 (Uruguay hosted the first World Cup in 1930 so there was no prior tournament; they were defending Olympic champions from 1928).\n\n\nThe unusual choice of host proved an issue for football fans in Europe, used to watching international matches on or close to their time zone.[7] With games taking place in the European morning, some schools and businesses chose to open late on match days or set up communal watching events before the start of work.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the third place play-off match against South Korea, Turkey won 3\u20132, taking third place in only their second ever FIFA World Cup, and scored the fastest goal in the FIFA World Cup history (10.8 seconds after kick-off).[2]\n\n\nThe 2002 World Cup was also the last one to use the golden goal rule and the last one to use the same ball for all matches. Starting in 2006 and continuing to the present, a ball with the same technical specifications but different colors has been used in the final.\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FIFA World Cup hosts\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe tournament had several upsets and surprise results, which included the defending champions France being eliminated in the group stage after earning a single point without scoring a goal and second favourites Argentina also being eliminated in the group stage. South Korea managed to reach the semi-finals, beating Poland, Portugal, Italy and Spain en route. They became the first team from outside of the UEFA, CONMEBOL, and CONCACAF regions and one of the first Asian teams (along with Turkey in this World Cup) to reach the semi-finals of a World Cup. However, the most potent team at the tournament, Brazil, prevailed, winning the final against Germany 2\u20130, making them the first and only country to have won the World Cup five times.[1] The victory qualified Brazil for the 2003 and subsequently 2005 FIFA Confederations Cups, its fourth and fifth Confederations Cup appearance in a row. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAll seven previous World Cup-winning nations (Argentina, Brazil, England, France, Germany, Italy, and Uruguay) qualified, which broke the record of most previous champions at a tournament before the record was broken again in 2014. The highest ranked team not to qualify for the finals was Colombia (ranked 4th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was China PR (ranked 50th).\n\n\n\n### List of qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nThe following 32 teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings,[11] qualified for the final tournament:\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AFC (4)* ![](image)\u00a0China (50) (debut)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Japan (32) (co-hosts)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia (34)\n* ![](image)\u00a0South Korea (40) (co-hosts)\n\nCAF (5)* ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon (17)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Nigeria (27)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Senegal (42) (debut)\n* ![](image)\u00a0South Africa (37)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia (31)\n\nOFC (0)* *None qualified*\n | CONCACAF (3)* ![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica (29)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Mexico (7)\n* ![](image)\u00a0United States (13)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2002 FIFA World Cup| 2002 FIFA \uc6d4\ub4dc\ucef5 \ud55c\uad6d/\uc77c\ubcf8\u00a0(Korean)*2002 FIFA Woldeu Keop Hanguk/Ilbon*2002 FIFA\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30ab\u30c3\u30d7 \u97d3\u56fd/\u65e5\u672c\u00a0(Japanese)*2002 FIFA Waarudo Kappu Kankoku/Nippon* |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Tournament details |\n| Host countries | South KoreaJapan |\n| Dates | 31 May \u2013 30 June |\n| Teams | 32\u00a0(from 5 confederations) |\n| Venue(s) | 20\u00a0(in 20 host cities) |\n| Final positions |\n| Champions | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil (5th title) |\n| Runners-up | ![](image)\u00a0Germany |\n| Third place | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey |\n| Fourth place | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea |\n| Tournament statistics |\n| Matches\u00a0played | 64 |\n| Goals scored | 161\u00a0(2.52 per match) |\n| Attendance | 2,705,198\u00a0(42,269 per match) |\n| Top scorer(s) | ![Brazil](image) Ronaldo (8 goals) |\n| Best player(s) | ![Germany](image) Oliver Kahn |\n| Best young player | ![United States](image) Landon Donovan |\n| Best goalkeeper | ![Germany](image) Oliver Kahn |\n| Fair play award | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium |\n| \u2190 1998\n2006 \u2192\n |\n\nInternational football competition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe two Asian rivals went on a massive and expensive PR blitz around the world, prompting Sultan Ahmad Shah, the head of the Asian Football Confederation, to step in.[3] FIFA boss Jo\u00e3o Havelange had long backed the Japanese bid,[4] but his rival in FIFA, UEFA chief Lennart Johansson, sought to undermine Havelange's plans.[4] UEFA and the AFC viewed co-hosting between the two Asian rivals as the best option.[4] South Korea and Japan were finally faced with a choice of having no World Cup or a shared World Cup and they reluctantly chose to go along with co-hosting.[4] South Korea and Japan were chosen unanimously as co-hosts in preference to Mexico.[5] This was the first World Cup to be hosted by more than one country, the second being the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. This is also the first ever World Cup to be hosted in Asia, the other being the 2022 World Cup, hosted by Qatar, twenty years later. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Pot 1Top-seeded teams(DC + hosts + top 5 seeds) | Pot 2Europe(UEFA) | Pot 3Asia & South America(AFC & CONMEBOL) | Pot 4Africa & North America(CAF & CONCACAF) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * ![](image)\u00a0France (1998 winner, group A1)\n* ![](image)\u00a0South Korea (co-hosts, group D1)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Japan (co-hosts, group H1)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* ![](image)\u00a0Brazil (1)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Argentina (2)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Italy (3)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Germany (4)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Spain (6)\n | * ![](image)\u00a0Belgium\n* ![](image)\u00a0Croatia\n* ![](image)\u00a0Denmark\n* ![](image)\u00a0England\n* ![](image)\u00a0Poland\n* ![](image)\u00a0Portugal\n* ![](image)\u00a0Republic of Ireland\n* ![](image)\u00a0Russia\n* ![](image)\u00a0Slovenia\n* ![](image)\u00a0Sweden\n* ![](image)\u00a0Turkey\n | * ![](image)\u00a0China\n* ![](image)\u00a0Ecuador\n* ![](image)\u00a0Paraguay\n* ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia\n* ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay\n | * ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon\n* ![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica\n* ![](image)\u00a0Mexico\n* ![](image)\u00a0Nigeria\n* ![](image)\u00a0Senegal\n* ![](image)\u00a0South Africa\n* ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia\n* ![](image)\u00a0United States\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n14 places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe), five by CAF teams (Africa), four by CONMEBOL teams (South America), four by AFC teams (Asia) and three by CONCACAF teams (North and Central America and the Caribbean).

Four nations qualified for the finals for the first time: China, Ecuador, Senegal and Slovenia. As of 2022, this was the last occasion on which the Republic of Ireland and Turkey qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals, and the only time that China have qualified, as well as the last time that Australia and Switzerland failed to qualify.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | \u22122\n | 3\n |\n| 25\n | D | ![](image)\u00a0Poland | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 3\n | 7\n | \u22124\n | 3\n |\n| 26\n | A | ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay | 3\n | 0\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n | 5\n | \u22121\n | 2\n |\n| 27\n | F | ![](image)\u00a0Nigeria | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 3\n | \u22122\n | 1\n |\n| 28\n | A | ![](image)\u00a0France | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n | 3\n | \u22123\n | 1\n |\n| 29\n | H | ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 5\n | \u22124\n | 1\n |\n| 30\n | B | ![](image)\u00a0Slovenia | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 2\n | 7\n | \u22125\n | 0\n |\n| 31\n | C | ![](image)\u00a0China | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 0\n | 9\n | \u22129\n | 0\n |\n| 32\n | E | ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 0\n | 12\n | \u221212\n | 0\n |\n\nSource: [*citation needed*]\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nThe sponsors of the 2002 FIFA World Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA World Cup Sponsors and South Korea and Japan Supporters.[58][59]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1Oliver Kahn is the only goalkeeper to have won the Golden Ball in FIFA World Cup history.[56]\n\n\n\n### All-star team[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Goalkeepers\n | Defenders\n | Midfielders\n | Forwards\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Germany](image) Oliver Kahn\n![Turkey](image) R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Re\u00e7ber\n | ![England](image) Sol Campbell\n![Spain](image) Fernando Hierro\n![South Korea](image) Hong Myung-bo\n![Turkey](image) Alpay \u00d6zalan\n![Brazil](image) Roberto Carlos\n | ![Germany](image) Michael Ballack\n![United States](image) Claudio Reyna\n![Brazil](image) Rivaldo\n![Brazil](image) Ronaldinho\n![South Korea](image) Yoo Sang-chul\n | ![Senegal](image) El Hadji Diouf\n![Germany](image) Miroslav Klose\n![Brazil](image) Ronaldo\n![Turkey](image) Hasan \u015ea\u015f\n |\n| Source: USA Today, 29 June 2002\n |\n\n\n### Final standings[edit]\n\n\nAfter the tournament, FIFA published a ranking of all teams that competed in the 2002 World Cup finals based on progress in the competition, overall results and quality of the opposition.[57]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSouth Korea and Japan were selected as hosts by FIFA on 31 May 1996.

The historic tradition to seed the hosts (Japan and South Korea) and holders (France) was upheld; while the remaining five seeds were granted to the other five of the top six teams, ranked by their results in the last three FIFA World Cups (ratio 3:2:1) and their FIFA World Ranking position in the last month of the past three years (equal ratio).[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe World Cup was originally going to be hosted either in Japan or in South Korea, but in the end both rivals had decided to share the hosting duties thus making this World Cup the first to have multiple host nations. However, there were concerns regarding the selection of hosts due to logistical issues caused by fans traveling across two separate sovereign nations as well as whether some of the 20 stadiums to be constructed for the World Cup would be ready in time for it or not. While political and infrastructural problems were eventually overcome, there still remained the issue of East Asia's wet season which could disrupt the play. The timing of the tournament thus had been altered to mitigate as much as possible against such issues, with the tournament kicking off on May 31 and due to run until June 30, the earliest date for a World Cup final since 1986.[83]\n\n\nThe time difference caused issues for fans worldwide especially in Europe, where people had to go to work when matches were played.[84]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe hosts became the first team in the Asian Football Confederation to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, eclipsing the record of their North Korean counterparts who reached the quarter-finals in 1966. They also became the first World Cup semi-final team not from UEFA or CONMEBOL since the United States did it in the first World Cup in 1930. Turkey defeated Senegal 1\u20130 in Osaka, with a golden goal scored by \u0130lhan Mans\u0131z in the 94th minute.\n\n\n\n21 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| England\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Owen ![](image) 23' | Report | Rivaldo ![](image) 45+2'Ronaldinho ![](image) 50' |\n\nStadium Ecopa, Shizuoka\nAttendance: 47,436\nReferee: Felipe Ramos (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n21 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Germany\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0United States |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ballack ![](image) 39' | Report |  |\n\nMunsu Football Stadium, Ulsan\nAttendance: 37,337\nReferee: Hugh Dallas (Scotland)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n22 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Some say Bonn, which did not host a match for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, was only the de facto seat of government of host West Germany but *not* its official *de jure* capital, which was Berlin.

A total of 64 games were played, including the final and a bronze medal game between the two semifinale losers.\n\n\nGroup F was considered the group of death, as it brought together Argentina, England, Nigeria and Sweden.[40]\n\n\nThe fixtures for the Group stage were decided based on the draw results, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup stage schedule\n| Matchday\n | Dates\n | Matches\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Matchday 1\n | 31 May \u2013 5 June 2002\n | 1 v 2, 3 v 4\n |\n| Matchday 2\n | 5\u201310 June 2002\n | 1 v 3, 4 v 2\n |\n| Matchday 3\n | 11\u201314 June 2002\n | 4 v 1, 2 v 3\n |\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJeonju World Cup Stadium, Jeonju\nAttendance: 31,000\nReferee: Hugh Dallas (Scotland)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n14 June 2002\n20:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| Portugal\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | Park Ji-sung ![](image) 70' |\n\nIncheon Munhak Stadium, Incheon\nAttendance: 50,239\nReferee: \u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez (Argentina)\n\n14 June 2002\n20:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| Poland\u00a0![](image) | 3\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0United States |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Olisadebe ![](image) 3'Krysza\u0142owicz ![](image) 5'\u017bew\u0142akow ![](image) 66' | Report | Donovan ![](image) 83' |\n\nDaejeon World Cup Stadium, Daejeon\nAttendance: 26,482\nReferee: Lu Jun (China)\n\n### Group E[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 FIFA World Cup Group E\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Spain\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20130 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| Hierro ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Baraja ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Xavi ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Joaqu\u00edn ![soccer ball with red X](image) | 3\u20135 | ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Hwang Sun-hong![soccer ball with check mark](image) Park Ji-sung![soccer ball with check mark](image) Seol Ki-hyeon![soccer ball with check mark](image) Ahn Jung-hwan![soccer ball with check mark](image) Hong Myung-bo |\n\nGwangju World Cup Stadium, Gwangju\nAttendance: 42,114\nReferee: Gamal Al-Ghandour (Egypt)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n22 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Senegal\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20131 (a.e.t./g.g.) | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | \u0130lhan ![gold-colored soccer ball](image)\u00a094'  |\n\nNagai Stadium, Osaka\nAttendance: 44,233\nReferee: \u00d3scar Ruiz (Colombia)\n\n### Semi-finals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the round of 16, Germany beat Paraguay 1\u20130 with a late goal by Oliver Neuville in Seogwipo.

Sweden and Senegal faced off in \u014cita and finished 1\u20131 in regular time and it took a golden goal from Henri Camara in extra time to settle the game for Senegal 2\u20131, which lead to Senegal becoming only the second African team to reach the last eight (after Cameroon in 1990). Spain and the Republic of Ireland played in Suwon, where Spain led most of the match 1\u20130 until a late penalty kick scored by Robbie Keane made the match go to extra time, where Spain emerged victorious in a penalty shoot-out. The United States beat CONCACAF rivals Mexico 2\u20130 in Jeonju with Brian McBride and Landon Donovan scoring the goals. Brazil defeated Belgium 2\u20130 in Kobe, with an amazing volley by Rivaldo and a splendid counter-attack goal by Ronaldo. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. Pot 1 was used to draw, in alphabetic group order, the remaining five top-seeded teams for the first position of groups B, C, E, F and G; while respecting the restriction that one of the two South American seeds (Brazil and Argentina) had to play in a group played in South Korea (B/C) and the other had to play in a group played in Japan (E/F/G).\n2. Pot 2 was used to draw one European team to each of the eight groups (drawing unrestricted in the alphabetic order from A to H).\n3. As per the FIFA rule of only allowing a maximum of two European teams in each group, the remaining three European teams from Pot 2, was subject to a second draw, to be put in either of the four groups containing a top-seeded South American team or Asian team. This was done by first drawing the European team from Pot 2, and then drawing which seeded opponent the European team should be paired with, from a special bowl with four blue balls containing the names of Brazil, Argentina, Japan and South Korea.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Mexico\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0United States |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | McBride ![](image) 8'Donovan ![](image) 65' |\n\nJeonju World Cup Stadium, Jeonju\nAttendance: 36,380\nReferee: V\u00edtor Melo Pereira (Portugal)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n17 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Brazil\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Rivaldo ![](image) 67'Ronaldo ![](image) 87' | Report |  |\n\nKobe Wing Stadium, Kobe\nAttendance: 40,440\nReferee: Peter Prendergast (Jamaica)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n18 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| Japan\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | \u00dcmit Davala ![](image) 12' |\n\nMiyagi Stadium, Rifu\nAttendance: 45,666\nReferee: Pierluigi Collina (Italy)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n18 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| South Korea\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20131 (a.e.t./g.g.) | ![](image)\u00a0Italy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Seol Ki-Hyeon ![](image) 88'Ahn Jung-Hwan ![gold-colored soccer ball](image)\u00a0117'  | Report | Vieri ![](image) 18' |\n\nDaejeon World Cup Stadium, Daejeon\nAttendance: 38,588\nReferee: Byron Moreno (Ecuador)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| South Africa\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20133 | ![](image)\u00a0Spain |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| McCarthy ![](image) 31'Radebe ![](image) 53' | Report | Ra\u00fal ![](image) 4', 56'Mendieta ![](image) 45+1' |\n\nDaejeon World Cup Stadium, Daejeon\nAttendance: 31,024\nReferee: Saad Mane (Kuwait)\n\n12 June 2002\n20:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| Slovenia\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20133 | ![](image)\u00a0Paraguay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A\u010dimovi\u010d ![](image) 45+1' | Report | Cuevas ![](image) 65', 84'Campos ![](image) 73' |\n\nJeju World Cup Stadium, Seogwipo\nAttendance: 30,176\nReferee: Felipe Ramos (Mexico)\n\n### Group C[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 FIFA World Cup Group C\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUEFA* Kim Milton Nielsen (Denmark)\n* Graham Poll (England)\n* Gilles Veissi\u00e8re (France)\n* Markus Merk (Germany)\n* Kyros Vassaras (Greece)\n* Pierluigi Collina (Italy)\n* Jan Wegereef (Netherlands)\n* Terje Hauge (Norway)\n* V\u00edtor Melo Pereira (Portugal)\n* Hugh Dallas (Scotland)\n* \u013dubo\u0161 Miche\u013e (Slovakia)\n* Antonio L\u00f3pez Nieto (Spain)\n* Anders Frisk (Sweden)\n* Urs Meier (Switzerland)\n\n\n | Assistant referees\nAFC* Komaleeswaran Sankar (India)\n* Awni Hassaouneh (Jordan)\n* Haidar Koleit (Lebanon)\n* Mat Lazim Awang Hamat (Malaysia)\n* Mohamed Saeed (Maldives)\n* Ali Al-Traifi (Saudi Arabia)\n* Visva Krishnan (Singapore)\n\nCAF* Wagih Farag (Egypt)\n* Dramane Dante (Mali)\n* Taoufik Adjengui (Tunisia)\n* Ali Tomusange (Uganda)\n* Brighton Mudzamiri (Zimbabwe)\n\nCONCACAF* Curtis Charles (Antigua and Barbuda)\n* H\u00e9ctor Vergara (Canada)\n* Vladimir Fern\u00e1ndez (El Salvador)\n* Michael Ragoonath (Trinidad and Tobago)\n\nCONMEBOL* Jorge Rattalino (Argentina)\n* Jorge Oliveira (Brazil)\n* Bomer Fierro (Ecuador)\n* Miguel Giacomuzzi (Paraguay)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** \"2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Official Song 'Live It Up' to be performed by all-star line-up\".

The final attracted an estimated audience of 715.1\u00a0million people.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FIFA World Cup hosts\n\nThe vote to choose the hosts of the 2006 tournament was held in July 2000 in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. It involved four bidding nations after Brazil had withdrawn three days earlier: Germany, South Africa, England and Morocco.[2] Three rounds of voting were required, each round eliminating the nation with the fewest votes. The first two rounds were held on 6 July 2000, and the final round was held on 7 July 2000, which Germany won over South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Voting results[3] |\n| --- |\n| Country\n | Round 1\n | Round 2\n | Round 3\n |\n| Germany | **10** | **11** | **12** |\n| South Africa | 6 | **11** | 11\n |\n| England | 5 | 2 | \u2013\n |\n| Morocco | 3 | \u2013 | \u2013\n |\n\n\n### Bribery and corruption allegations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nItaly won the tournament, claiming their fourth World Cup title, defeating France 5\u20133 in a penalty shoot-out in the final after extra time had finished in a 1\u20131 draw. Germany defeated Portugal 3\u20131 to finish in third place. Angola, Ukraine, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Trinidad and Tobago and Togo made their first appearances in the finals. It was also the only appearance of Serbia and Montenegro under that name; they had previously appeared in 1998 as Yugoslavia. In late May 2006, immediately prior to the tournament, Montenegro voted in a referendum to become an independent nation and dissolve the loose confederacy then existing between it and Serbia; Serbia recognised the results of the referendum in early June. Due to time constraints, FIFA had Serbia and Montenegro play in the World Cup tournament as one team, marking the first instance of multiple sovereign nations competing as one team in a major football tournament since UEFA Euro 1992.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"World Cup and Television\" (PDF).

Teams representing 198 national football associations from all six populated continents participated in the qualification process which began in September 2003. Thirty-one teams qualified from this process along with hosts Germany for the finals tournament. It was the second time that Germany staged the competition and the first as a unified country along with the former East Germany with Leipzig as a host city (the other was in 1974 in West Germany), and the 10th time that the tournament was held in Europe.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** \"*Azzurri* prominent in All Star Team\".

No player from the winning Italian squad scored more than two goals, though ten players had scored for the team, tying France's record in 1982 for the most goalscorers from any one team.\n\n\nFor the first time ever in the FIFA World Cup, the first and last goals of the tournament were scored by defenders. German left-back Philipp Lahm scored the opener against Costa Rica after only 5\u00a0minutes of the opening match. In the final, Italian centre-back Marco Materazzi out-jumped Patrick Vieira and headed in the last goal of the 2006 World Cup.

The team was chosen from a shortlist of over 50\u00a0players, and was selected based on performances from the second round onwards.[47][48]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccusations of bribery and corruption had marred the success of Germany's bid from the very beginning. On the very day of the vote, a hoax bribery affair was made public, leading to calls for a re-vote.[4] On the night before the vote, German satirical magazine *Titanic* sent letters to FIFA representatives, offering joke gifts like cuckoo clocks and Black Forest ham in exchange for their vote for Germany. Oceania delegate Charlie Dempsey, who had initially backed England, had then been instructed to support South Africa following England's elimination. He abstained, citing \"intolerable pressure\" on the eve of the vote.[5] Had Dempsey voted as originally instructed, the vote would have resulted with a 12\u201312 tie, and FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who favoured the South African bid,[6] would have had to cast the deciding vote.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Fans in celebratory motorcade\n![](image)Celebrating fans in Olympiapark in Munich during the opening match between Germany and Costa Rica\nFIFA president Sepp Blatter stated the organization of the tournament was the best in history and that Germany had a welcoming public.[102] Through the many fanfests and large-screen broadcasts the feeling of a four-week national festival developed, in which much of the population took part.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 22 March 2016, it was announced that the FIFA Ethics Committee was opening proceedings into the bid.[15][16][17]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\n198 teams attempted to qualify for the 2006 World Cup.[18] Germany, the host nation, was granted automatic qualification, with the remaining 31 finals places divided among the continental confederations. Thirteen places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe), five by CAF teams (Africa), four by CONMEBOL teams (South America), four by AFC teams (Asia), and three by CONCACAF teams (North and Central America and Caribbean). The remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and CONCACAF and between CONMEBOL and OFC (Oceania).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFIFA predetermined that, hosts, Germany would be placed in Group A, thus being assured of the venues of their group matches in advance of the draw. They also announced, in advance, that Brazil (the defending champion) would be allocated to Group F.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite early success by Australia, Ecuador and Ghana, the tournament marked a return to dominance of traditional football powers. Four years after the 2002 tournament, in which teams from North America (the United States), Africa (Senegal) and Asia (South Korea) made it deep into the knockout stages and Turkey finished third, all eight seeded teams progressed to the knockout stages and none of the quarter-finalists were from outside Europe or South America. Six former champions took part in the quarter-finals, with Ukraine and Euro 2004 runners-up Portugal as the only relative outsiders.[41] Argentina and Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals, leaving an all-European final four for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966 and 1982 tournaments).\n\n\n\n### Scoring[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFile:FIFA World Cup 2006 Opening Ceremony.jpg2006 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Munich\nThe finals tournament of the 2006 World Cup began on 9 June. The 32\u00a0teams were divided into eight groups of four teams each, within which the teams competed in a round-robin tournament to determine which two of those four teams would advance to the sixteen-team knock-out stage, which started on 24 June. In total, 64\u00a0games were played.\n\n\n\n### Hosting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* 2006 FIFA World Cup:\n\t+ A time to make friends\n\t+ Broadcasting rights\n\t+ Controversies\n\t+ Disciplinary record\n\t+ Officials\n\t+ Organizing Committee\n\t+ Qualification\n\t+ Seeding\n\t+ Sponsorship\n\t+ Squads\n\t+ FIFA World Cup records\n* Leeuwenhosen controversy\n* *Strangers*, a 2007 film which takes place during the 2006 World Cup\n* *Deutschland.

No two teams from the same group qualified for the quarters, all eight teams were from different groups.\n\n\nEngland struggled against Ecuador but won 1\u20130 thanks to a David Beckham free kick. Brazil won 3\u20130 against Ghana, in a game which included Ronaldo's record 15th World Cup goal. *Der Spiegel* reported that the match may have been influenced by an Asian betting syndicate.[44] Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1\u20130. The only goal came courtesy of a Maniche strike in an acrimonious match, which marked a new World Cup record with 16\u00a0yellow cards (Portugal: 9, the Netherlands: 7) and 4\u00a0players being sent off for a second bookable offence. France came from behind to defeat Spain 3\u20131 thanks to goals from Franck Rib\u00e9ry, Patrick Vieira, and Zinedine Zidane.\n\n\n\n24 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Voting procedure for 2006 FIFA World Cup decision\".

Czech Republic and Ukraine were making their first appearance as independent nations, but had previously been represented as part of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union respectively; Serbia and Montenegro had competed as Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1998, as well as making up part of Yugoslav teams from 1930 to 1990. As of 2022, this was the last time Togo, Angola, Czech Republic, Ukraine and Trinidad and Tobago qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals, and the last time Uruguay failed to qualify.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the original version of the rules for the finals tournament, the ranking criteria were in a different order, with head-to-head results taking precedence over total goal difference. The rules were changed to the above in advance of the tournament, but older versions were still available on the FIFA and UEFA websites, causing some confusion among those trying to identify the correct criteria.[39]\nIn any event, the finals tournament saw only two pairs of teams level on points: Argentina and the Netherlands at 7 points in Group C; Tunisia and Saudi Arabia at 1 point in Group H. Both of these ties were resolved on total goal difference. Also, in both cases the teams had tied their match, so the order of ranking criteria made no difference.\n\n\n\n## Finals tournament[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPictures of football supporters celebrating in front of video walls became a typical illustration of atmosphere in the country, while \"Fanmeile\" was later picked up as the German Word of the Year.[60] In 2007, FIFA and the 12 host cities received the German Marketing Prize for Sports for the innovative nature and marketing concept of Fan Fests.[61] FIFA and the Host Cities succeeded in creating and comfortable environment for foreign fans as 95% of them surveyed at Fan Fests agreed that it was an unequivocal declaration of international nature of World Cup and not a mere event for Germans.[58] A thought-out implementation of public viewing at such a large-scale football event as the 2006 World Cup became set a precedent. Immediately after the World Cup, FIFA announced that it registered the trademark for Fan Fests, taking over the organisation and marketing and making Fan Fests an integral part of future World Cups.[62]\n\n\n\n### Locations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Teams listed by FIFA ranking as of May 2006[19] |\n| --- |\n|  | Country | Confederation | Rank\n |\n| 1 | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | CONMEBOL | 1\n |\n| 2 | ![](image)\u00a0Czech Republic | UEFA | 2\n |\n| 3 | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | UEFA | 3\n |\n| 4 | ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | CONCACAF | 4\n |\n| 5 | ![](image)\u00a0United States | CONCACAF | 5\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Spain | UEFA | 5\n |\n| 7 | ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | UEFA | 7\n |\n| 8 | ![](image)\u00a0France | UEFA | 8\n |\n| 9 | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | CONMEBOL | 9\n |\n| 10 | ![](image)\u00a0England | UEFA | 10\n |\n| 11 | ![](image)\u00a0Italy | UEFA | 13\n |\n| 12 | ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | UEFA | 16\n |\n| 13 | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | AFC | 18\n |\n| 14 | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | UEFA | 19\n |\n| 15 | ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia | CAF | 21\n |\n| 16 | ![](image)\u00a0Iran | AFC | 23\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Croatia | UEFA | 23\n |\n| 18 | ![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica | CONCACAF | 25\n |\n| 19 | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | AFC | 29\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Poland | UEFA | 29\n |\n| 21 | ![](image)\u00a0Ivory Coast | CAF | 32\n |\n| 22 | ![](image)\u00a0Paraguay | CONMEBOL | 33\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Gelsenkirchen, England faced Portugal in a repeat of their Euro 2004 quarter-final.

The team's trainer, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, in February 2007 was furthermore awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz, not least for his reformed methods of modern training and playing methods, in which he persevered despite harsh criticism. Nevertheless, Klinsmann announced after the tournament that he would not extend his contract as trainer of the national team, since he felt completely burned-out and wished to spend more time with his family in California. The German Football Association (DFB) on the same day named as Klinsmann's successor his assistant trainer Joachim L\u00f6w, since in the opinion of the DFB leadership he would best continue Klinsmann's work and training methods.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the opening match of the tournament, Germany and Costa Rica played a game which ended 4\u20132 for the host in the highest scoring opening match in the tournament's history. Germany went on to win the Group A after edging Poland and breezing past Ecuador 3\u20130. Despite the defeat, Ecuador had already joined the host in the Round of 16 having beaten Poland and Costa Rica 2\u20130 and 3\u20130, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0Germany (H) | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 8\n | 2\n | +6\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0Ecuador | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 5\n | 3\n | +2\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Poland | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | \u22122\n | 3\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 3\n | 9\n | \u22126\n | 0\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria  \n(H) Hosts\n\n9 June 2006\n18:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tournament had a record number of yellow and red cards, breaking the previous record set by the 1998 World Cup. Players received a record-breaking 345\u00a0yellow cards and 28\u00a0red cards, with Russian referee Valentin Ivanov handing out 16\u00a0yellow and 4\u00a0red cards in the round of 16 match between Portugal and the Netherlands in a match known as the Battle of Nuremberg. Portugal had two players suspended for each of the quarter-final and semi-final matches respectively. FIFA President Sepp Blatter hinted that he may allow some rule changes for future tournaments so that earlier accumulated bookings will not force players to miss the final, should their teams make it that far. The tournament also saw English referee Graham Poll mistakenly hand out three yellow cards to Croatia's Josip \u0160imuni\u0107 in their match against Australia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 7\n | 1\n | +6\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 5\n | 5\n | 0\n | 4\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Croatia | 3\n | 0\n | 2\n | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | \u22121\n | 2\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 7\n | \u22125\n | 1\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria\n\n12 June 2006\n15:00\n\n\n| Australia\u00a0![](image) | 3\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Japan |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Cahill ![](image) 84', 89'\n* Aloisi ![](image) 90+2'\n | Report | * Nakamura ![](image) 26'\n |\n\nFritz-Walter-Stadion, Kaiserslautern\nAttendance: 46,000\nReferee: Essam Abd El Fatah (Egypt)\n\n13 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Brazil\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Croatia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Kak\u00e1 ![](image) 44'\n | Report |  |\n\nOlympiastadion, Berlin\nAttendance: 72,000\nReferee: Benito Archundia (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Munich](image)\nMunich\n![Stuttgart](image)\nStuttgart\n![Gelsenkirchen](image)\nGelsenkirchen\n![Hamburg](image)\nHamburg\n![Frankfurt](image)\nFrankfurt\n![Cologne](image)\nCologne\n![Hanover](image)\nHanover\n![Leipzig](image)\nLeipzig\n![Kaiserslautern](image)\nKaiserslautern\n![Nuremberg](image)\nNuremberg\n2006 FIFA World Cup (Germany)\n | Hamburg |\n| Arena AufSchalke\u2020**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Gelsenkirchen)** | AOL Arena**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Hamburg)** |\n| 51\u00b033\u203216.21\u2033N 7\u00b04\u20323.32\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff51.5545028\u00b0N 7.0675889\u00b0E\ufeff / 51.5545028; 7.0675889\ufeff (Arena AufSchalke) | 53\u00b035\u203213.77\u2033N 9\u00b053\u203255.02\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff53.5871583\u00b0N 9.8986167\u00b0E\ufeff / 53.5871583; 9.8986167\ufeff (AOL Arena) |\n| Capacity: **52,000**[25] | Capacity: **50,000**[26] |\n|  | ![](image) |\n| Frankfurt, Hesse | Kaiserslautern, Rhineland-Palatinate |\n| Commerzbank-Arena\u2020**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Frankfurt)** | Fritz-Walter-Stadion |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 16 October 2015, German news magazine *Der Spiegel* alleged that a slush fund with money from then-Adidas CEO Robert Louis-Dreyfus was used to influence the vote of four Asian members of the FIFA executive committee.[10] The sum of \u20ac6.7\u00a0million was later demanded back by Dreyfus.

Playing in their first World Cup for 32 years, Australia came from behind to defeat Japan 3\u20131, and, despite losing 0\u20132 to Brazil, a 2\u20132 draw with Croatia was enough to give the Australians a place in the Round of 16 in a game where two players were sent-off for second bookings and one, erroneously, for a third booking by English referee Graham Poll. The Brazilians won all three games to qualify first in the group. Their 1\u20130 win against Croatia was through a goal late in the first-half by Kak\u00e1.

The experience of past World Cups and public viewing was conceptualized in 4-week-long events for football supporters to meet, board, interact, partake in cultural activities and watch all 64 matches on giant video walls. Since 2004, the details on costs, logistics, safety issues, marketing and broadcasting rights were jointly hammered out by FIFA and the host cities.[52] These public viewing events, known as \"Fan Fests\" (German: *Fanmeile*), served an idea to provide football supporters without tickets a legitimate opportunity to partake in the World Cup. Unlike the past tournaments where ticket-less fans were treated as security risks, the World Cup in Germany welcomed all supporters, thus generating positive atmosphere even before the tournament began. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"Dortmund\". *FIFA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association)*.

Zinedine Zidane opened the scoring by converting a controversial seventh-minute penalty kick,[45] which glanced off the underside of the crossbar and bounced beyond the goal line before it spun back up, hit the crossbar again and rebounded out of the goal.[46] Marco Materazzi then levelled the scores in the 19th minute following an Andrea Pirlo corner. Both teams had chances to score the winning goal in normal time: Luca Toni hit the crossbar in the 35th minute for Italy (he later had a header disallowed for offside), while France were not awarded a possible second penalty in the 53rd minute when Florent Malouda went down in the box after a tackle from Gianluca Zambrotta.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSquads for the 2006 World Cup consisted of 23\u00a0players, as in the previous tournament in 2002. Each participating national association had to confirm its 23-player squad by 15 May 2006.[35]\n\n\n\n## Groups[edit]\n\n\n### Seeds[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2006 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAustralia qualified for the first time since 1974. Among the teams who failed to qualify were 2002 third-placed team Turkey, quarter-finalists Senegal, Euro 2004 winners Greece and 2006 Africa Cup of Nations winners Egypt. Additionally, Belgium failed to qualify for the first time since 1978 and Cameroon failed to qualify for the first time since 1986. The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Nigeria, who had made the previous three tournaments, and Denmark and South Africa, who had both qualified for the previous two. France had their first successful qualifying campaign since 1986, as they did not qualify for the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, in 1998 they were automatically qualified as hosts and in 2002 as defending champions.\n\n\nFor the first time since the 1982 World Cup, all six confederations were represented at the finals tournament.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n18 June 2006\n15:00\n\n\n| Japan\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Croatia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nFrankenstadion, Nuremberg\nAttendance: 41,000\nReferee: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium)\n\n18 June 2006\n18:00\n\n\n| Brazil\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Australia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Adriano ![](image) 49'\n* Fred ![](image) 90'\n | Report |  |\n\nFIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich\nAttendance: 66,000\nReferee: Markus Merk (Germany)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n22 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Japan\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20134 | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Tamada ![](image) 34'\n | Report | * Ronaldo ![](image) 45+1', 81'\n* Juninho ![](image) 53'\n* Gilberto ![](image) 59'\n |\n\nWestfalenstadion, Dortmund\nAttendance: 65,000\nReferee: \u00c9ric Poulat (France)\n\n22 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Croatia\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Australia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Srna ![](image) 2'\n* N.

It took place in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July 2010. The bidding process for hosting the tournament finals was open only to African nations. In 2004, the international football federation, FIFA, selected South Africa over Egypt and Morocco to become the first African nation to host the finals.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe winning bid was announced by FIFA president Sepp Blatter at a media conference on 15 May 2004 in Z\u00fcrich; in the first round of voting, South Africa received 14 votes, Morocco received 10 votes and Egypt no votes. South Africa, which had narrowly failed to win the right to host the 2006 event, was thus awarded the right to host the tournament.[12] Campaigning for South Africa to be granted host status, Nelson Mandela had previously spoken of the importance of football in his life, stating that while incarcerated in Robben Island prison playing football \"made us feel alive and triumphant despite the situation we found ourselves in\".[13] With South Africa winning their bid, an emotional Mandela raised the FIFA World Cup Trophy.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** \"Theron, Beckham and Gebrselassie to star at the Final Draw on 4 December\". *FIFA.com*.

Five African nations placed bids to host the 2010 World Cup: Egypt, Morocco, South Africa and a joint bid from Libya and Tunisia.\n\n\nFollowing the decision of the FIFA Executive Committee not to allow co-hosted tournaments, Tunisia withdrew from the bidding process.

Spain became the eighth nation to win the tournament and the first European nation to win a World Cup hosted outside its home continent: all previous World Cups held outside Europe had been won by South American nations. They are also the first national team since 1978 to win a World Cup after losing a game in the group stage. As a result of their win, Spain represented the World in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Host nation South Africa were eliminated in the group stage and both 2006 World Cup finalists Italy and France were also eliminated at the group stage. It was the first time that the hosts had been eliminated in the first stage. New Zealand, with their three draws, were the only undefeated team in the tournament, but they were also eliminated in the group stage.\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Goalkeeper\n | Defenders\n | Midfielders\n | Forwards\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Spain](image) Iker Casillas\n | ![Germany](image) Philipp Lahm ![Spain](image) Sergio Ramos![Spain](image) Carles Puyol![Brazil](image) Maicon\n | ![Spain](image) Xavi![Germany](image) Bastian Schweinsteiger![Netherlands](image) Wesley Sneijder![Spain](image) Andr\u00e9s Iniesta\n | ![Spain](image) David Villa![Uruguay](image) Diego Forl\u00e1n\n |\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Spain shirt from 2014, autographed by members of the 2010 World Cup-winning squad, on display in Madrid\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nThe sponsors of the 2010 World Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA Partners, FIFA World Cup Sponsors and National Supporters.[103][104][105][106]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n177. **^** \"Empty seats concern FIFA but attendances stay high\".

Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome controversies arose during the qualifications. In the second leg of the play-off between France and the Republic of Ireland, French captain Thierry Henry, unseen by the referee, handled the ball in the lead up to a late goal, which enabled France to qualify ahead of Ireland, sparking widespread comment and debate. FIFA rejected a request from the Football Association of Ireland to replay the match,[23] and Ireland later withdrew a request to be included as an unprecedented 33rd World Cup entrant.[24][25] As a result, FIFA announced a review into the use of technology or extra officials at the highest level, but decided against the widely expected fast-tracking of goal-line referee's assistants for the South African tournament.[26]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe FIFA Organising Committee approved the procedure for the final draw on 2 December 2009. The seeding was based on the October 2009 FIFA World Ranking and seven squads joined hosts South Africa as seeded teams for the final draw.

The English said thank you and accepted that you can win some and you lose some and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it.\"[85] Blatter also promised to re-open the discussion regarding devices which monitor possible goals and make that information immediately available to match officials, saying: \"We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and have the first opportunity in July at the business meeting.\"[85] Blatter's call came less than four months after FIFA general secretary J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke said the door was closed on goal-line technology and video replays after a vote by the IFAB.[85]\n\n\n\n26 June 2010\n16:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2010 FIFA World Cup| * isiZulu: *iNdebe Yomhlaba Ye-FIFA ka-2010*\n* Afrikaans: *FIFA Sokker-W\u00eareldbekertoernooi in 2010*\n* isiXhosa: *2010 FIFuRoni da Futboll*\n* Northern Sotho: *Mogopo wa Lefase wa FIFA wa 2010*\n* Sesotho: *Mohope wa lefatse wa FIFA 2010*\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)*Ke Nako* (Tswana and Sotho)*It's time.

In preparation for this, the teams were organised into four pots with the seven highest-ranked teams joining host nation Brazil in the seeded pot.[19] As with the previous tournaments, FIFA aimed to create groups which maximised geographic separation and therefore the unseeded teams were arranged into pots based on geographic considerations.[20][21] The draw took place on 6 December 2013 at the Costa do Sau\u00edpe resort in Bahia, during which the teams were drawn by various past World Cup-winning players.[22][23] Under the draw procedure, one randomly drawn team \u2013 Italy \u2013 was firstly relocated from Pot 4 to Pot 2 to create four equal pots of eight teams.[24]\n\n\n\n### Officials[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup officials\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2014 FIFA World Cup stadiums\n |\n| --- |\n| * Mineir\u00e3o (Belo Horizonte)\n* Est\u00e1dio Nacional Man\u00e9 Garrincha (Bras\u00edlia)\n* Arena Pantanal (Cuiab\u00e1)\n* Arena da Baixada (Curitiba)\n* Castel\u00e3o (Fortaleza)\n* Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia (Manaus)\n* Arena das Dunas (Natal)\n* Beira-Rio (Porto Alegre)\n* Arena Pernambuco (Recife)\n* Maracan\u00e3 (Rio de Janeiro)\n* Arena Fonte Nova (Salvador)\n* Arena Corinthians (S\u00e3o Paulo)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nReferees at the 2014 FIFA World Cup\n |\n| --- |\n| AFC | * Ravshan Irmatov\n* Yuichi Nishimura\n* Nawaf Shukralla\n* Ben Williams\n |\n| CAF | * Noumandiez Dou\u00e9\n* Bakary Gassama\n* Djamel Haimoudi\n |\n| CONCACAF | * Joel Aguilar\n* Mark Geiger\n* Marco Antonio Rodr\u00edguez\n |\n| CONMEBOL | * Enrique Osses\n* N\u00e9stor Pitana\n* Wilmar Rold\u00e1n\n* Sandro Ricci\n* Carlos Vera\n |\n| OFC | * Peter O'Leary\n |\n| UEFA | * Felix Brych\n* C\u00fcneyt \u00c7ak\u0131r\n* Jonas Eriksson\n* Bj\u00f6rn Kuipers\n* Milorad Ma\u017ei\u0107\n* Pedro Proen\u00e7a\n* Nicola Rizzoli\n* Carlos Velasco Carballo\n* Howard Webb\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **2014 FIFA World Cup** was the 20th FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for men's national football teams organised by FIFA. It took place in Brazil from 12 June to 13 July 2014, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2007. It was the second time that Brazil staged the competition, the first being in 1950, and the fifth time that it was held in South America.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the tournament, FIFA received significant criticism for the way head injuries are handled during matches. Two incidents in particular attracted the most attention. First, in a group stage match, after Uruguayan defender \u00c1lvaro Pereira received a blow to the head, he lay unconscious.[156] The Uruguayan doctor signaled for the player to be substituted, but he returned to the match. The incident drew criticism from the professional players' union FIFPro, and from Michel D'Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee.[157]\n\n\nSecond, in the Final, German midfielder Christoph Kramer received a blow to the head from a collision in the 14th minute, but returned to the match before collapsing in the 31st minute. During that time, Kramer was disoriented and confused, and asked the referee Nicola Rizzoli whether the match he was playing in was the World Cup Final.[158]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup\n* FIFA World Cup\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. On 31 January 2014, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team,[32] having earlier circulated a brochure of 84 prospective locations.[35] Most teams opted to stay in the Southeast Region of Brazil, with only eight teams choosing other regions; five teams (Croatia, Germany, Ghana, Greece and Switzerland) opted to stay in the Northeast Region and three teams (Ecuador, South Korea and Spain) opted to stay in the South Region. None opted to stay in the North Region or the Central-West Region.[36] Campo Bahia, the base camp of the eventual champion Germany, attracted much interest.[37]\n\n\n\n\n\n| National squads' base camps\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Passarinho, Nathalia; Matoso, Filipe (14 July 2014). \"Em balan\u00e7o da Copa, Dilma diz que Brasil derrotou progn\u00f3sticos 'terr\u00edveis'\". *G1* (in Portuguese).

Uruguay were eliminated in the round of 16, and France exited in the quarter-finals.

Twenty-four of these teams were returning participants from the 2010 World Cup. Bosnia and Herzegovina were the only team with no previous appearance at the World Cup finals.[nb 1][18] Colombia qualified for the World Cup after 16 years of absence, while Belgium and Russia both returned after 12 years. Paraguay failed to qualify for the first time since 1994. This was also the first World Cup for 32 years that did not feature a representative from the Nordic countries. Iran, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Croatia returned to the tournament after missing the 2010 tournament. The highest ranked team not to qualify was Ukraine (ranked 16th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was Australia (ranked 62nd).[17]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs with the 2010 tournament, each team's squad consisted of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers). Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player squad no later than 10 days before the start of the tournament.[29] Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game.[29] During a match, all remaining squad members not named in the starting team were available to be one of the three permitted substitutions (provided the player was not serving a suspension).[29]\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup venues\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway) / Kim Haglund (Norway)\n |\n| C\u00fcneyt \u00c7ak\u0131r (Turkey)\n | Bahattin Duran (Turkey) | Tar\u0131k Ongun (Turkey)\n |\n| Jonas Eriksson (Sweden)\n | Mathias Klasenius (Sweden) | Daniel W\u00e4rnmark (Sweden)\n |\n| Bj\u00f6rn Kuipers (Netherlands)\n | Sander van Roekel (Netherlands) | Erwin Zeinstra (Netherlands)\n |\n| Milorad Ma\u017ei\u0107 (Serbia)\n | Milovan Risti\u0107 (Serbia) | Dalibor \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107 (Serbia)\n |\n| Pedro Proen\u00e7a (Portugal)\n | Bertino Miranda (Portugal) | Tiago Trigo (Portugal)\n |\n| Nicola Rizzoli (Italy)\n | Renato Faverani (Italy) | Andrea Stefani (Italy)\n |\n| Carlos Velasco Carballo (Spain)\n | Roberto Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez (Spain) | Juan Carlos Yuste Jim\u00e9nez (Spain)\n |\n| Howard Webb (England)\n | Michael Mullarkey (England) | Darren Cann (England)\n |\n\n\n### Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup squads\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2014 FIFA World Cup| *Copa do Mundo da FIFA Brasil 2014*\u00a0(Brazilian Portuguese) |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)*Juntos num s\u00f3 ritmo*(lit.\u2009'Together in a single rhythm')\n |\n| Tournament details |\n| Host country | Brazil |\n| Dates | 12 June \u2013 13 July |\n| Teams | 32\u00a0(from 5 confederations) |\n| Venue(s) | 12\u00a0(in 12 host cities) |\n| Final positions |\n| Champions | ![](image)\u00a0Germany (4th title) |\n| Runners-up | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina |\n| Third place | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands |\n| Fourth place | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil |\n| Tournament statistics |\n| Matches\u00a0played | 64 |\n| Goals scored | 171\u00a0(2.67 per match) |\n| Attendance | 3,429,873\u00a0(53,592 per match) |\n| Top scorer(s) | ![Colombia](image) James Rodr\u00edguez(6 goals)[1] |\n| Best player(s) | ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi[2] |\n| Best young player | ![France](image) Paul Pogba[3] |\n| Best goalkeeper | ![Germany](image) Manuel Neuer[4] |\n| Fair play award | ![](image)\u00a0Colombia[5] |\n| \u2190 2010\n2018 \u2192\n |\n\nInternational football competition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12 July 2014\n17:00 BRT (UTC\u22123)\n\n\n| Brazil\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20133 | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Van Persie ![](image) 3'\u00a0(pen.)\n* Blind ![](image) 17'\n* Wijnaldum ![](image) 90+1'\n |\n\nEst\u00e1dio Nacional Man\u00e9 Garrincha, Bras\u00edlia\nAttendance: 68,034\nReferee: Djamel Haimoudi (Algeria)\n\n### Final[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup final\n\nThe final featured Germany against Argentina for a record third time after 1986 and 1990.\n\n\n\n13 July 2014\n16:00 BRT (UTC\u22123)\n\n\n| Germany\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20130 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| G\u00f6tze ![](image) 113' | Report |  |\n\nMaracan\u00e3 Stadium, Rio de Janeiro\nAttendance: 74,738\nReferee: Nicola Rizzoli (Italy)\n\nThis marked the first time that teams from the same continent had won three consecutive World Cups (following Italy in 2006 and Spain in 2010).

Prominent examples were the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which already held a Fan Fest in 2010, and S\u00e3o Paulo's Vale do Anhangaba\u00fa.[38][39] The first official event took place on Iracema Beach, in Fortaleza, on 8 June 2014.[40]\n\n\n\n## Innovations[edit]\n\n\n### Technologies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first drawn (and goalless) match did not occur until the 13th match of the tournament, between Iran and Nigeria: a drought longer than any World Cup since 1930.[67] The group stage produced a total of 136 goals (an average of 2.83 goals per match), nine fewer than were scored during the entire 2010 tournament.[68] This is the largest number of goals in the group stage since the 32-team system was implemented in 1998[69] and the largest average in a group stage since 1958.[70] World Cup holders Spain were eliminated after only two games, the quickest exit for the defending champions since Italy's from the 1950 tournament.[71] Spain also became the fourth nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown, the first one being Italy in 1950 (and again in 2010), Brazil in 1966, and France in 2002.[72] For the first time, two teams from Africa advanced to the second round, a feat that would be repeated in the 2022 tournament.\n\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe marketing of the 2014 FIFA World Cup included sale of tickets, support from sponsors and promotion through events that utilise the symbols and songs of the tournament. Popular merchandise included items featuring the official mascot as well as an official video game that has been developed by EA Sports.[118] As a partner of the German Football Association, part of German major airline Lufthansa's fleet was branded \"Fanhansa\" for the time being. Branded planes flew the Germany national team, media representatives and football fans to Brazil.[119]\n\n\nThe Sony Xperia Z2 was dubbed the \"official smartphone of the 2014 FIFA World Cup\".[120]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nThe sponsors of the 2014 World Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA Partners, FIFA World Cup Sponsors and National Supporters.[121]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n145. **^** Peck, Brooks (29 May 2013). \"Sepp Blatter, Brazil president Dilma booed at Confederations Cup opening ceremony\". *Sports.yahoo.com*.

The water-based spray, which disappears within minutes of application, can be used to mark a ten-yard line for the defending team during a free kick and also to draw where the ball is to be placed for a free kick.[45]\n\n\nThe Adidas Brazuca was the official match ball of the 2014 FIFA World Cup[46][47][48][49] and was supplied by Forward Sports of Sialkot, Pakistan.[46] Adidas created a new design of ball after criticisms of the Adidas Jabulani used in the previous World Cup. The number of panels was reduced to six, with the panels being thermally bonded. This created a ball with increased consistency and aerodynamics compared to its predecessor. Furthermore, Adidas underwent an extensive testing process lasting more than two years to produce a ball that would meet the approval of football professionals.\n\n\n\n### Cooling breaks[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** Setterlund, Carl (28 June 2014). \"Colombia topples Uruguay to reach first World Cup quarterfinals\".

The least-used venues were in Cuiab\u00e1, Manaus, Natal, and Curitiba, which hosted four matches each; as the four smallest stadiums in use at the tournament, they did not host any knockout round matches.[34]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDue to the relatively high ambient temperatures in Brazil, particularly at the northern venues, cooling breaks for the players were introduced.[50] Breaks could take place at the referee's discretion after the 30th minute of each half if the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature exceeded 32\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F); the breaks would last 3 minutes, with this time made up by an extended period of stoppage time at the end of the half.\n\n\nThe first cooling break in a World Cup play took place during the 32nd minute of the match between the Netherlands and Mexico in the round of 16.[51][52][53][54] At the start of the match, FIFA listed the temperature at 32\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F) with 68% humidity.[55]\n\n\n\n### Anti-doping[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Howells, Richard (11 June 2014). \"World Cup 2014: Adidas \"Brazuca\" Ball Scores With Fans\". *Forbes*.

It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in Eastern Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.[1][2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938. Host nation  Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.

Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa Am\u00e9rica champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.

Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.[37] Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n | **UEFA** (14)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Belgium (3)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Croatia (20)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Denmark (joint 12)\n* ![](image)\u00a0England (joint 12)\n* ![](image)\u00a0France (7)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Germany (1)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Iceland (22)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Poland (8)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Portugal (4)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Russia (70) (hosts)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Serbia (34)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Spain (10)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Sweden (24)\n* ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland (6)\n | ![](image)Qualified\n Did not qualify\n Disqualified\n Not a FIFA member\n\n\n |\n\n### Draw[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\n![](image)Italian World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro in Moscow at the 2018 World Cup draw\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.[63][64] The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n281. **^** \"McDonald's looking ahead to 2018\". *FIFA.com*.

The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8\u00a0billion was spent on hosting the tournament.[89]\n\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.[90] He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".[91]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters. After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup,[252] and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro),[253] the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.[254][255][256]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.\n![](image)The 100-ruble commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
