On the other hand, they have fewer weeks in the academic year than other universities, so the extent to which this is so may be exaggerated by these results.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university has come under criticism for the number of students it accepts from private schools;[132] for instance, Laura Spence's rejection from the university in 2000 led to widespread debate.[133] In 2016, the University of Oxford gave 59% of offers to UK students to students from state schools, while about 93% of all UK pupils and 86% of post-16 UK pupils are educated in state schools.[134][135][136] However, 64% of UK applicants were from state schools and the university notes that state school students apply disproportionately to oversubscribed subjects.[137] The proportion of students coming from state schools has been increasing. From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%.[138] Oxford University spends over \u00a36\u00a0million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.[134]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** \"Oxford's Said Business School\". *The Guardian*. 10 December 2001.

Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[48][49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n139. **^** \"Oxford failing on diversity says Lammy\". *BBC News*. 23 May 2018.

These, to a large extent, remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press, and he made significant contributions to the Bodleian Library, the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to receive the BA degree from the university and \"dissenters\" were only permitted to receive the MA in 1871.[37]\n\n\nThe university was a centre of the Royalist party during the English Civil War (1642\u20131649), while the town favoured the opposing Parliamentarian cause.[38]\n\n\n\n![Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College](image)Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College\nWadham College, founded in 1610, was the undergraduate college of Sir Christopher Wren.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCollegiate university in Oxford, England\n\n\"Oxford University\" redirects here.

It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Map of the University of Oxford\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversities and colleges in South East England\n |\n| --- |\n| Universities | * BPP\n* Brighton\n* Buckingham\n* Buckinghamshire New\n* Canterbury\n* Chichester\n* Creative Arts\n* Kent\n* Law\n* Open\n* Oxford\n* Oxford Brookes\n* Portsmouth\n* Reading\n* Solent\n* Southampton\n* Surrey\n* Sussex\n* Winchester\n |\n| Further education colleges | * Abingdon & Witney\n* Andover\n* Ashford\n* Aylesbury\n* Banbury & Bicester\n* Basingstoke\n* Berkshire\n* Bracknell & Wokingham\n* Brockenhurst\n* Brooklands\n* Canterbury\n* Crawley College\n* Chichester\n* East Kent\n* Eastleigh\n* East Surrey\n* East Sussex College (Lewes, Newhaven, Eastbourne and Hastings)\n* Fareham\n* Farnborough\n* Guildford\n* Hadlow\n* Havant and South Downs\n* Haywards Heath College\n* Henley\n* Highbury\n* Isle of Wight\n* Brighton MET College\n* MidKent\n* Milton Keynes\n* Newbury\n* Northbrook College\n* North East Surrey\n* North Kent\n* Oxford (City)\n* Plumpton\n* Reading\n* Ruskin\n* Southampton\n* Sparsholt\n* Totton\n* West Kent\n* Windsor Forest\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university passed a statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level;[54] for a brief period in the early 1900s, this allowed the \"steamboat ladies\" to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[55] In June 1878, the *Association for the Education of Women* (AEW) was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford.

Stephen Toope, the university's outgoing Vice-Chancellor, said the decision to suspend its collaboration with UAE also was a result of additional revelations about UAE's Pegasus software hacking.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Bonds[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge borrowed \u00a3350\u00a0million in October 2012 by issuing 40-year security bonds,[95] whose interest rate is approximately 0.6 percent higher than the British government's 40-year bond.[96]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs a result of St Hilda's College, Oxford ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining university in the United Kingdom with female-only colleges; the two female-only colleges at the university are Newnham and Murray Edwards.[38][39] As of the 2019\u20132020 academic year, the university's male to female enrollment, including post-graduates, was nearly balanced with its total student population being 53% male and 47% female.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2006, a Thomson Scientific study reported that the University of Cambridge had the highest research paper output of any British university and ranked first in research production as assessed by total paper citation count in ten of 21 major British research fields.[170] An evidence-based study published the same year showed that the University of Cambridge won a larger proportion (6.6%) of total British research grants and contracts than any other university, ranking first in three out of four major measured discipline fields.[171]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Cambridge, List of organisations and institutions associated with the University of Cambridge, and List of social activities at the University of Cambridge\n\n### Formal halls and May balls[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** Grace 2 5 December 2007\n84. **^** \"How the University works: The Senate\".

But since women were not yet admitted to the Bachelor of Arts degree program, they were excluded from the university's governance structure. Since University of Cambridge students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to few university colleges that had been established only for them. Darwin College, the first graduate college of the university, matriculated both male and female students from its inception in 1964 and elected a mixed fellowship. Undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare, and King's Colleges, began admitting women between 1972 and 1988. Among women's colleges at the university, Girton began admitting male students in 1979, and Lucy Cavendish began admitting men in 2021. But the other female-only colleges have remained female-only colleges as of 2023. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 2021, Cambridge created foundation courses for disadvantaged students.[139] While the usual entry requirements are A\\*AA in A-Levels, the one-year foundation course has 50 places for students who achieve BBB.[140] If successful on the course, students receive a recognised CertHE qualification and can progress to degrees in the arts, humanities, and social sciences at the university.[139] Candidates include those who have been in care, who are estranged from their families, who have missed significant periods of learning because of health issues, those from low-income backgrounds, and those from schools with few students attending universities.[139]\n\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge School (intellectual history) and List of professorships at the University of Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Percent of state school students at Cambridge and Oxford[125][126]\nPublic debate in the United Kingdom exists over whether admissions processes used at the University of Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit-based and fair, whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply, and whether these students are offered sufficient admission.

Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople.[10][11] The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*. In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter granted by King Henry III.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2021, Cambridge Students' Union launched a petition opposing the financial collaboration between the university and the government of United Arab Emirates that was worth \u00a3400m. The Union cited a \"values gap\" and threat to \"academic freedom and institutional autonomy\" following the release of internal UAE documents. Citing UAE's history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.[182]\n\n\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university's catering services. The students backed vegan food in response to threats to the climate and biodiversity. The vote is non-binding since the university controls the catering service.[183] After the vote, Darwin College decided to serve only vegan food at its May Ball in 2023.[184]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and academics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Cambridge\n |\n| --- |\n| People | * Chancellor\n\t+ The Lord Sainsbury of Turville\n* Vice-Chancellor\n\t+ Deborah Prentice\n* List of University of Cambridge people\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Colleges | * Christ's\n* Churchill\n* Clare\n* Clare\u00a0Hall\n* Corpus\u00a0Christi\n* Darwin\n* Downing\n* Emmanuel\n* Fitzwilliam\n* Girton\n* Gonville\u00a0and\u00a0Caius\n* Homerton\n* Hughes\u00a0Hall\n* Jesus\n* King\u2019s\n* Lucy\u00a0Cavendish\n* Magdalene\n* Murray\u00a0Edwards\n* Newnham\n* Pembroke\n* Peterhouse\n* Queens\u2019\n* Robinson\n* St\u00a0Catharine\u2019s\n* St\u00a0Edmund\u2019s\n* St\u00a0John\u2019s\n* Selwyn\n* Sidney\u00a0Sussex\n* Trinity\n* Trinity\u00a0Hall\n* Wolfson\n |\n| Faculties anddepartments, by school | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Peterhouse Old Court](image)Peterhouse Old Court\n![](image)Great Court of Trinity College, dating back to the 16th Century\nAdmission to the University of Cambridge is competitive.

The clause can be invoked in the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university. The clause was introduced following a record number of A-level pupils obtained the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of A-level examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.[110][111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| University  of London | * Birkbeck\n* City\n* Courtauld\n* Goldsmiths\n* Institute of Cancer Research\n* King's\n* London Business School\n* LSE\n* LSHTM\n* Queen Mary\n* Royal Academy of Music\n* Royal Central School of Speech and Drama\n* Royal Holloway\n* Royal Veterinary College\n* School of Advanced Study\n* St George's\n* SOAS\n* UCL\n |\n| Other | * Brunel\n* East London\n* Greenwich\n* Imperial\n* Kingston\n* London Met\n* London South Bank\n* Middlesex\n* Northeastern University \u2013 London\n* Ravensbourne\n* Regent's\n* Richmond, The American International University in London\n* Royal College of Art\n* Royal College of Music\n* Roehampton\n* St Mary's\n* University of the Arts London\n* Westminster\n* West London\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Grove at Fitzwilliam College\n* ![Gatehouse at Girton College](image)\n\nGatehouse at Girton College\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United Kingdom portal\n\n\n* Armorial of British universities\n* Cambridge University Constabulary\n* Cambridge University primates\n* Coat of arms of the University of Cambridge\n* List of medieval universities\n* List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Cambridge\n* List of organisations and institutions associated with the University of Cambridge\n* List of organisations with a British royal charter\n* List of professorships at the University of Cambridge\n* List of universities in the United Kingdom\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere were, as of the 2020\u201321 admissions cycle, only two grounds for compulsory pooling.

A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Cambridge's first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, the Bishop of Ely. Multiple additional colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, and colleges continued being established through modern times, though there was a 204-year gap between the founding of Sidney Sussex in 1596 and that of Downing in 1800. The most recent college to be established is Robinson, which was built in the late 1970s. Most recently, in March 2010, Homerton College achieved full university college status, making it technically the university's newest full college.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** \"Trinity Hall's Steamboat Ladies\".

Some of these awards and prizes rank among the world's most estimable academic and intellectual accomplishments. Among the most prominent of them are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Cambridge University Act 1856 formalised the university's organisational structure and introduced the study of many new subjects, including theology, history, and Modern languages.[28] Resources necessary for new courses in the arts, architecture, and archaeology were donated by Viscount Fitzwilliam of Trinity College, who also founded Fitzwilliam Museum in 1816.[29] In 1847, Prince Albert was elected the university's chancellor in a close contest with the Earl of Powis. As chancellor, Albert reformed university curricula beyond its initial focus on mathematics and classics, adding modern era history and the natural sciences. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThroughout its history, the University of Cambridge has frequently been featured in literature, artistic works, television, and film. As of February 2023, IMDb lists 82 films or television shows that feature the University of Cambridge as a filming location.[191][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nCambridge was mentioned as early as the 14th century in Geoffrey Chaucer's *The Canterbury Tales*. In *The Reeve's Tale*, the two main fictional characters are students at a University of Cambridge college called Soler Halle, which is believed to refer to King's Hall and is now part of Trinity College.[192]\n\n\nThe university has been the setting for all or parts of numerous novels, including Douglas Adams' *Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency*, Rose Macaulay's *They Were Defeated*,[193] and Tom Sharpe's *Porterhouse Blue*.[194]\n\n\nOther notable examples of the University of Cambridge in popular culture include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: A Classical Adventure: The Architectural History of Downing College, Cambridge; Cambridge Medical School building; Cambridge Observatory; Cambridge University Library; Cambridge University Real Tennis Club; Fitzwilliam Museum; Goldie Boathouse; Lady Mitchell Hall; Old Schools; Senate House, Cambridge; Scott Polar Research Institute; University of Cambridge Sports Centre; and William Gates Building, Cambridge\n\nThe university occupies a central location within the city of Cambridge. University of Cambridge students represent approximately 20 percent of the town's population, which was 145,674 as of 2021, and contributes on whole to a lower age demographic in the city.[52]\n\n\nMost of the university's older colleges are located near the city centre through which River Cam flows. Students and others traditionally punt on the River Cam, which provides views of the university's buildings and campuses that surround the river.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSee also: Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge was one of only two universities to hold parliamentary seats in the Parliament of England and was later one of 19 represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The constituency was created by a Royal charter of 1603 and returned two members of parliament until 1950 when it was abolished by the Representation of the People Act 1948. The constituency was not a geographical area; rather, its electorate consisted of university graduates. Before 1918, the franchise was restricted to male graduates with a doctorate or MA degree.\n\n\n\n### Women's education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor the first several centuries of its existence, as was the case broadly in England and the world, the University of Cambridge was only open to male students. The first colleges established for women were Girton College, founded by Emily Davies in 1869, Newnham College, founded by Anne Clough and Henry Sidgwick in 1872, Hughes Hall, founded in 1885 by Elizabeth Phillips Hughes as the Cambridge Teaching College for Women, Murray Edwards College, founded in 1954 by Rosemary Murray as New Hall, and Lucy Cavendish College, founded in 1965. Prior to ultimately being permitted admission to the university in 1948, female students were granted the right to take University of Cambridge exams beginning in the late 19th century.[36] Women were also allowed to study courses, take examinations, and have prior exam results recorded retroactively, dating back to 1881; for a brief period after the turn of the 20th century, this allowed the steamboat ladies to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2016[update], athletes who are university graduates or attendees had won 194 Olympic medals, including 88 gold medals.[15][*needs update*] Alumni of the university include Chinese six-time world table tennis champion Deng Yaping; sprinter and athletics hero Harold Abrahams; inventors of the modern game of football, H. de Winton and J.

In 1988, Magdalene became the last all-male college to accept women.[65] Clare Hall and Darwin admit only postgraduates, and Hughes Hall, St Edmund's, and Wolfson admit only mature undergraduate and graduate students who are 21 years or older on the date of their matriculation. Lucy Cavendish, which was previously a women-only mature college, began admitting both men and women in 2021.[66] All other colleges admit both undergraduate and postgraduate students without any age restrictions.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** Refers to operational estate owned by the university, including the 550-hectare (1,400-acre) University Farm[8] but not including college-owned property or investment properties\n2. **^** Includes those who indicate that they identify as Asian, Black, Mixed Heritage, Arab or any other ethnicity except White.\n3. **^** Calculated from the Polar4 measure, using Quintile1, in England and Wales.

The economic growth associated with the university's high tech and biotech growth has been labeled the Cambridge Phenomenon, and has included the addition of 1,500 new companies and as many as 40,000 new jobs added between 1960 and 2010, mostly at Silicon Fen, a business cluster launched by the university in the late 20th century.[48]\n\n\n\n### Myths, legends and traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Cambridge legends\n\nSee also: Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge\n\nFurther information: Nine Lessons and Carols and wooden spoon (award)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Institute of Continuing Education at Madingley Hall\n![](image)Old Schools (left) houses the university's administrative offices.\nIn addition to the 31 colleges, the university maintains over 150 departments, faculties, schools, syndicates, and other academic institutions.[75] Members of these are usually members of one of the colleges, and responsibility for the entire academic programme of the university is divided among them.\n\n\nThe university has a department dedicated to providing continuing education, the Institute of Continuing Education, which is based primarily in Madingley Hall, a 16th-century manor house in Cambridgeshire. Its award-bearing programmes include both undergraduate certificates and part-time master's degrees.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStrong applicants who are not successful in being admitted to their chosen college at the university may be placed in the Winter Pool, where they can be considered for admission to other university colleges, which maintains consistency throughout the colleges, some of which receive more applicants than others.\n\n\nUndergraduate applications are processed through UCAS, and the deadline for their submission currently is mid-October in the year before prior to beginning. Until the 1980s, candidates for all subjects were required to take special entrance examinations,[116] which have since been replaced by additional tests for some subjects, such as the Thinking Skills Assessment and Cambridge Law Test.[117] The university has at times considered reintroducing an admissions exam for all subjects.[118]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. ![Pembroke College heraldic shield](image) Pembroke\n21. ![Peterhouse coat of arms](image) Peterhouse\n22. ![Queens' College heraldic shield](image) Queens'\n23. ![Robinson College heraldic shield](image) Robinson\n24. ![Selwyn College heraldic shield](image) Selwyn\n25. ![Sidney Sussex College heraldic shield](image) Sidney Sussex\n26. ![St Catharine's College heraldic shield](image) St Catharine's\n27. ![](image) St Edmund's\n28. ![St John's College heraldic shield](image) St John's\n29. ![Trinity College coat of arms](image) Trinity\n30. ![Trinity Hall heraldic shield](image) Trinity Hall\n31. ![Wolfson College Crest](image) Wolfson\n\n### Schools, faculties and departments[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge \u00a7\u00a0Schools, Faculties, and Departments\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n184. **^** \"Darwin to hold first ever 'vegan' May Ball\". *Varsity Online*.

Teaching, and the fees it earned, nearly came to a halt during World War I, and severe financial difficulties followed. As a result, the university received its first systematic state support in 1919, and a Royal commission was appointed in 1920 to recommend that the university (but not its colleges) begin receiving an annual grant.[33] Following World War II, the university experienced a rapid expansion in applications and enrollment, partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.[34] This was not without controversies, however. For example, Cambridge researchers were accused in 2023 of helping to develop weapon systems for Iran.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Parliamentary representation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArtists Quentin Blake, Roger Fry, Rose Ferraby, and Julian Trevelyan, sculptors Antony Gormley, Marc Quinn, and Anthony Caro, and photographers Antony Armstrong-Jones, Cecil Beaton, and Mick Rock are each University of Cambridge alumni.\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese terms are shorter than those of many other British universities.[143] Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacation holiday periods, which are referred to by the university as vacations rather than holidays; students vacate the premises during these periods but are still expected to be pursuing studies and assignments.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Emmanuel College Chapel\n![](image)Peterhouse, Cambridge's first college, founded in 1284\nThe colleges at the University of Cambridge were originally an incidental feature of the university; no college within the University of Cambridge is as old as the university itself.

There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels, which were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, and they have left some traces, including the naming of Garret Hostel Lane and Garret Hostel Bridge, a street and bridge in Cambridge.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Midlands | * Aston\n* Birmingham\n* Birmingham City\n* Bishop Grosseteste\n* Coventry\n* De Montfort\n* Derby\n* Harper Adams\n* Keele\n* Leicester\n* Lincoln\n* Loughborough\n* Newman\n* Northampton\n* Nottingham\n* Nottingham Trent\n* Staffordshire\n* University College Birmingham\n* Warwick\n* Wolverhampton\n* Worcester\n |\n| North | * Bolton\n* Bradford\n* Central Lancashire\n* Chester\n* Cumbria\n* Durham\n* Edge Hill\n* Huddersfield\n* Hull\n* Lancaster\n* Leeds\n* Leeds Arts\n* Leeds Beckett\n* Leeds Trinity\n* Liverpool\n* Liverpool Hope\n* Liverpool John Moores\n* LSTM\n* Manchester\n* Manchester Metropolitan\n* Newcastle\n* Northumbria\n* Salford\n* Sheffield\n* Sheffield Hallam\n* Sunderland\n* Teesside\n* York\n* York St. John\n |\n| South | * Arts University Bournemouth\n* Bath\n* Bath Spa\n* Bournemouth\n* Brighton\n* Bristol\n* Buckingham\n* Buckinghamshire New\n* Canterbury Christ Church\n* Chichester\n* Creative Arts\n* Exeter\n* Falmouth\n* Hartpury\n* Gloucestershire\n* Kent\n* Oxford\n* Oxford Brookes\n* Plymouth\n* Plymouth Marjon\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Cambridge Students' Union\n\nAll students at the University of Cambridge are represented by Cambridge Students' Union, which was founded in 2020 as a merger of two student unions, Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU) and the Graduate Union (GU). CUSU previously represented all University students, and GU represented graduate students.[178][179]\n\n\nThe eight most important positions in Cambridge Students' Union are occupied by sabbatical officers.[180] In 2020, the sabbatical officers were elected with a turnout of 20.88% of the whole student body.[181]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university quickly established itself as a global leader in the study of mathematics. The university's examination in mathematics, known as the Mathematical Tripos,[25] was initially compulsory for all undergraduates studying for the Bachelor of Arts degree, the most common degree first offered at Cambridge. From the time of Isaac Newton in the late 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained an especially strong emphasis on applied mathematics, and especially mathematical physics. Students awarded first class honours after completing the mathematics Tripos exam are called wranglers, and the top student among them is known as the Senior Wrangler, a position that has been described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain.\"[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNotable University of Cambridge buildings include King's College Chapel,[54] the history faculty building[55] designed by James Stirling, and the Cripps Building at St John's College.[56] The brickwork of several colleges is notable: Queens' College has some of the earliest patterned brickwork in England[57] and the brick walls of St John's College are examples of English bond, Flemish bond, and Running bond.[58]\n\n\n\n### Sites[edit]\n\n\nThe university is divided into several sites, which house the university's various departments, including:[59]\n\n\n\n* Addenbrooke's Hospital\n* Downing Site\n* Madingley/Gorton\n* New Museums Site\n* North West Cambridge Development\n* Old Addenbrooke's Site\n* Old Schools\n* Silver Street/Mill Lane\n* Sidgwick Site\n* West Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn medieval times, many colleges were founded so that their members could pray for the souls of the founders. University of Cambridge colleges often were associated with chapels or abbeys. The colleges' focus began to shift in 1536, however, with the dissolution of the monasteries and Henry VIII's order that the university disband the canon law that governed the university's faculty[23] and stop teaching scholastic philosophy. In response, colleges changed their curricula from canon law to classics, the Bible, and mathematics.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA school in the University of Cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units. Each has an elected supervisory body known as a Council, composed of representatives of the various constituent bodies. The University of Cambridge maintains six such schools:[77]\n\n\n\n* Arts and Humanities\n* Biological Sciences\n* Clinical Medicine\n* Humanities and Social Sciences\n* Physical Sciences\n* Technology\n\nTeaching and research at the university is organised by faculties. The faculties have varying organisational substructures that partly reflect their respective histories and the university's operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions. A small number of bodies called syndicates hold responsibility for teaching and research, including for the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, the University Press, and the University Library.\n\n\n\n### Central administration[edit]\n\n\n#### Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCambridge's oldest student newspaper is *Varsity*. Established in 1947, notable figures who have edited the newspaper include Jeremy Paxman, BBC media editor Amol Rajan, and *Vogue* international editor Suzy Menkes.

The colleges are charged with giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s, the University of Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues.[147] From 2000 to 2006, the University of Cambridge maintained a research partnership with MIT in the United States, known as the Cambridge\u2013MIT Institute, which was discontinued after evolving into what is now called the CMI Partnership Programme.\n\n\n\n### Graduation tradition and ceremony[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** Vitullo-Martin, J.

The effort was initiated in 2016 by Lord Myners, then chairman of the LSE's Council and Court of Governors. The plan includes working with wealthy alumni of LSE to make large contributions, increasing the annual budget surplus, and launching a new, widescale alumni donor campaign. The plan to grow LSE's endowment to more than \u00a31bn has been continued by Lord Myners' successors at the LSE.[124] The LSE has stated that currently \"limited endowment funding constrains our ability to offer 'needs blind' admission to students\".[122] Between 2015 and 2022, the endowment increased from \u00a3113 million to \u00a3229 million.[125][126]\n\n\n\n### Academic year[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLondon School of Economics and Political Science| ![](image)Coat of arms\n |\n| Motto | Latin: *Rerum cognoscere causas* |\n| Motto in\u00a0English\n | To understand the causes of things |\n| Type | Public research university |\n| Established | 1895\u00a0(1895) |\n| Endowment | \u00a3229.4 million (2022)[1] |\n| Budget | \u00a3436.9 million (2021\u201322)[1] |\n| Chair | Susan Liautaud[2] |\n| Chancellor | The Princess Royal(as Chancellor of the University of London) |\n| Visitor | Penny Mordaunt(as Lord President of the Council *ex officio*) |\n| Academic staff\n | 1,830 (2021/22)[3] |\n| Administrative staff\n | 2,260 (2021/22)[3] |\n| Students | 12,975 (2021/22)[4] |\n| Undergraduates | 5,575 (2021/22)[4] |\n| Postgraduates | 7,400 (2021/22)[4] |\n| Location | London\n, England\n51\u00b030\u203250\u2033N 0\u00b007\u203200\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff51.51389\u00b0N 0.11667\u00b0W\ufeff / 51.51389; -0.11667 |\n| Campus | Urban |\n| President and Vice-Chancellor[a] | Professor Eric Neumayer (interim) |\n| Newspaper | *The Beaver* |\n| Colours | Purple, black and gold[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n145. **^** \"LSE Undergraduate Prospectus\".

The area is historically known as Clare Market. LSE has more than 11,000 students, just under seventy percent of whom come from outside the UK, and 3,300 staff.[9] It had an income of \u00a3436.9\u00a0million in 2021/22, of which \u00a335.5\u00a0million was from research grants.[1] The university has the fifth-largest endowment of any university in the UK.

Its history began with Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria, who developed his vision for a cultural area that included the Royal Albert Hall, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum and several royal colleges.[6][7] In 1907, Imperial College London was established by royal charter, unifying the Royal College of Science, the Royal School of Mines and the City and Guilds of London Institute.[8] In 1988, the Imperial College School of Medicine was formed by merging with St Mary's Hospital Medical School. In 2004, Queen Elizabeth II opened the Imperial College Business School.\n\n\nImperial College London focuses on science, engineering, business, and medicine. The main campus is in South Kensington, where most teaching and research takes place. A second campus in White City provides a platform for innovation and entrepreneurship. Facilities also include teaching hospitals throughout London that form an academic health science centre. The college was previously a member of the University of London and became an independent university in 2007.[9] Imperial has a highly international community, with 59% of students from outside the UK and 140 countries represented on campus.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prince Albert was the main patron of the early Royal Colleges and the development of an area of culture in South Kensington\nMain article: History of Imperial College London\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest college that led to the formation of Imperial was the Royal College of Chemistry, founded in 1845, with the support of Prince Albert and parliament.[7] This was merged in 1853 into what became known as the Royal School of Mines.[12] The medical school has roots in many different schools across London, the oldest of which being Charing Cross Hospital Medical School which can be traced back to 1823, followed by teaching starting at Westminster Hospital in 1834, and St Mary's Hospital in 1851.[13][14][15]\n\n\nIn 1851, the Great Exhibition was organised as an exhibition of culture and industry by Henry Cole and by Prince Albert, husband of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom, Queen Victoria. An enormously popular and financial success, proceeds from the Great Exhibition were designated to develop an area for cultural and scientific advancement in South Kensington.[16] Within the next six years the Victoria and Albert Museum and Science Museum had opened, joined by new facilities in 1871 for the Royal College of Chemistry, and in 1881 the opening of the Royal School of Mines and Natural History Museum.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Imperial Institute, now the site of Queen's Lawn\nIn 1881, the Normal School of Science was established in South Kensington under the leadership of Thomas Huxley, taking over responsibility for the teaching of the natural sciences and agriculture from the Royal School of Mines.[18] The school was renamed the Royal College of Science by royal consent in 1890.[19] The Central Institution of the City and Guilds of London Institute was opened as a technical education school on Exhibition Road by the Prince of Wales in 1884, with courses beginning in 1885.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)Royal College of Science\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, there was a concern that Great Britain was falling behind Germany in scientific and technical education. A departmental committee was set up at the Board of Education in 1904, to look into the future of the Royal College of Science. A report released in 1906 called for the establishment of an institution unifying the Royal College of Science and the Royal School of Mines, as well as \u2013 if an agreement could be reached with the City and Guilds of London Institute \u2013 its Central Technical College.[20][21]\n\n\nOn 8 July 1907, Edward VII granted a Royal Charter establishing the Imperial College of Science and Technology. This incorporated the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Science. It also made provisions for the City and Guilds College to join once conditions regarding its governance were met, as well as for Imperial to become a college of the University of London.[22] The college joined the University of London on 22 July 1908, with the City and Guilds College joining in 1910.[8][23] The main campus of Imperial College was constructed beside the buildings of the Imperial Institute, the new building for the Royal College of Science having opened across from it in 1906, and the foundation stone for the Royal School of Mines building being laid by King Edward VII in July 1909.[20]\n\n\nAs students at Imperial had to study separately for London degrees, in January 1919, students and alumni voted for a petition to make Imperial a university with its own degree awarding powers, independent of the University of London.[24][25] In response, the University of London changed its regulations in 1925 so that the courses taught only at Imperial would be examined by the university, enabling students to gain a BSc.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)Royal School of Mines\nIn October 1945, George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Imperial to commemorate the centenary of the Royal College of Chemistry, which was the oldest of the institutions that united to form Imperial College. \"Commemoration Day\", named after this visit, is held every October as the university's main graduation ceremony.[27][28] The college also acquired a biology field station at Silwood Park near Ascot, Berkshire in 1947[29]\n\n\nFollowing the Second World War, there was again concern that Britain was falling behind in science \u2013 this time to the United States. The Percy Report of 1945 and Barlow Committee in 1946 called for a \"British MIT\"-equivalent, backed by influential scientists as politicians of the time, including Lord Cherwell, Sir Lawrence Bragg and Sir Edward Appleton.[30][31] The University Grants Committee strongly opposed however,[30] and so a compromise was reached in 1953, where Imperial would remain within the university, but double in size over the next ten years.[32][33] The expansion led to a number of new buildings being erected. These included the Hill building in 1957 and the Physics building in 1960, and the completion of the East Quadrangle, built in four stages between 1959 and 1965. The building work also meant the demolition of the City and Guilds College building in 1962\u201363, and the Imperial Institute's building by 1967.[34] Opposition from the Royal Fine Arts Commission and others meant that Queen's Tower was retained, with work carried out between 1966 and 1968 to make it free standing.[35] New laboratories for biochemistry, established with the support of a \u00a3350,000 grant from the Wolfson Foundation, were opened by the Queen in 1965.[36][37]\n\n\nIn 1988, Imperial merged with St Mary's Hospital Medical School under the Imperial College Act 1988. Amendments to the royal charter changed the formal name of the institution to *The Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine* and made St Mary's a constituent college.[38] This was followed by mergers with the National Heart and Lung Institute in 1995 and the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1997, with the Imperial College Act 1997 formally establishing the Imperial College School of Medicine.[39]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Imperial was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right by the Privy Council. In 2004, the Imperial College Business School and a new main college entrance on Exhibition Road were opened.[40][41] The UK Energy Research Centre was also established in 2004 and opened its headquarters at Imperial. On 9 December 2005, Imperial announced that it would commence negotiations to secede from the University of London.[42] Imperial became fully independent of the University of London in July 2007.[9][43][44]\n\n\nIn April 2011, Imperial and King's College London joined the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation as partners with a commitment of \u00a340 million each to the project. The centre was later renamed the Francis Crick Institute and opened on 9 November 2016. It is the largest single biomedical laboratory in Europe. The college began moving into the new White City campus in 2016, with the launching of the Innovation Hub.[45] This was followed by the opening of the Molecular Sciences Research Hub for the Department of Chemistry, officially opened by Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan in 2019.[46]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Imperial College Business School and College Main Entrance\n### South Kensington[edit]\n\n\nThe South Kensington campus is the college's main campus, where most teaching and research takes place. It is home to many notable buildings, such as the Business School, Royal School of Mines, and Royal College of Science. It is also the original site of the Imperial Institute, whose Queen's Tower stands at the heart of the campus overlooking Queen's Lawn. As part of a cultural centre known as Albertopolis the campus is surrounded by many of London's most popular attractions, including the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace, museums including the Natural History Museum, Science Museum, and Victoria and Albert Museum, and institutions such as the Royal College of Art, the Royal College of Music, and the National Art Library.\n\n\nThe campus has many restaurants and caf\u00e9s run by the college, and contains much of the college's student accommodation, including the Prince's Garden Halls, and Beit Hall, home to the college union, which runs student pubs, a nightclub, and a cinema on site. To the north, within easy walking distance of the college, are Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, with green spaces and sports facilities used by many of the student clubs.\n\n\n\n![](image)Many students enjoy Kensington Gardens\n### White City[edit]\n\n\nImperial has a new second major campus in White City providing a platform for innovation and entrepreneurship.[47] The hub houses research facilities, postgraduate accommodation, as well as a commercialisation space.[48][49] The campus is home to the Scale Space and incubator, Invention Rooms, a college hackerspace and community outreach centre.[50] The White City campus also includes another biomedical centre funded by Sir Michael Uren.[51][52][53]\n\n\n\n### Silwood Park[edit]\n\n\nSilwood Park is a postgraduate campus of Imperial in the village of Sunninghill near Ascot in Berkshire. The Silwood Park campus is a centre for research and teaching in ecology, evolution, and conservation. It is set in 100 hectares of parkland used for ecological field experiments.\n\n\n\n### Hospitals[edit]\n\n\nImperial has teaching hospitals across London which are used by the School of Medicine for undergraduate clinical teaching and medical research. All are based around college-affiliated hospitals, and also provide catering and sport facilities. College libraries are located on each campus, including the Fleming library at St Mary's.[54]\n\n\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Faculties and departments[edit]\n\n\nImperial is organised by four faculties: the Faculty of Engineering, the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Natural Sciences, and the Imperial College Business School.[55]\n\n\n\n**Faculty of Engineering**\n\n\n\n* Aeronautical Engineering\n* Bioengineering\n* Chemical Engineering\n* Civil & Environmental Engineering\n* Computing\n* Dyson School of Design Engineering\n* Earth Science & Engineering\n* Electrical & Electronic Engineering\n* Materials\n* Mechanical Engineering\n**Faculty of Medicine**\n\n\n\n* Brain Sciences\n* Immunology & Inflammation\n* Infectious Disease\n* Metabolism, Digestion & Reproduction\n* Surgery and Cancer\n* Institute of Clinical Sciences\n* National Heart and Lung Institute\n* School of Public Health\n**Faculty of Natural Sciences**\n\n\n\n* Chemistry\n* Mathematics\n* Physics\n* Life Sciences\n* Centre for Environmental Policy\n**Imperial College Business School**\n\n\n\n* Analytics & Operations\n* Economics & Public Policy\n* Finance\n* Management & Entrepreneurship\n* Marketing\n\n### Interdisciplinary centres[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis\nImperial hosts centres to promote inter-disciplinary work under the titles of Global Challenge institutes, Imperial Centres of Excellence and Imperial Networks of Excellence. It also participates as a partner in a number of national institutes.[56]\n\n\n\n**Global Challenge institutes:**\n* Data Science Institute\n* Energy Futures Laboratory\n* Grantham Institute for Climate Change\n* Institute for Molecular Science and Engineering\n* Institute for Security Science and Technology\n* Institute of Global Health Innovation\n* Institute of Infection\n**National institutes:**\n- Francis Crick Institute\n\n- Rosalind Franklin Institute\n\n- Alan Turing Institute\n\n- Henry Royce Institute\n\n- Faraday Institution\n\n- UK Dementia Research Institute\n\n### Academic centres[edit]\n\n\nImperial College also houses two academic centres, formerly the Department of Humanities, offering teaching to undergraduate and postgraduate students in modern languages, arts and humanities subjects, social sciences and other subjects which fall outside of the standard remit of science, technology and medicine. The aim of these centres is to provide training in study skills, such as the acquisition of English language proficiency, but also to encourage innovatory and interdisciplinary approaches to science, technology and medicine, which might make use of study of the arts, humanities, languages and social sciences. The academic centres are the:\n\n\n\n* Centre for Academic English\n* Centre for Languages, Culture and Communication\n\n\nThe Centre for Languages, Culture and Communication also operates as Imperial College London's adult education centre, offering evening class courses in the arts, humanities, languages and sciences.[57]\n\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Faculty Building, designed by Norman Foster\nSee also: President of Imperial College London and Provost of Imperial College London\n\nThe council is the governing body of Imperial. The council consists of the Chairman, the President, the Provost, the President of Imperial College Union, 4 senior staff members, and between 9 and 13 lay advisory members (who are not employees of Imperial).\n\n\nThe President is the highest academic official and chief executive of Imperial College London.[58] The position has been held by Hugh Brady, since August 2022[update].[59] The current Provost is Ian Walmsley, and the current Chair is John Allan.[60]\n\n\n\n### Finances and endowment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Graduation ceremonies take place in the Royal Albert Hall\nIn 2020/21, Imperial had a consolidated income of \u00a31,079.3 million. The college's endowment is sub-divided into three distinct portfolios:\n\n\n\n* Unitised Scheme \u2013 a unit trust vehicle for the college, Faculties and Departments to invest endowments and unfettered income to produce returns for the long term\n* Non-Core Property \u2013 a portfolio containing around 120 operational and developmental properties which the college has determined are not core to the academic mission\n* Strategic Asset Investments \u2013 containing the college's shareholding in Imperial Innovations and other restricted equity holdings.[61]\n\n\n### Affiliations and partnerships[edit]\n\n\nImperial is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, European University Association, Global Alliance of Technological Universities, League of European Research Universities and the Russell Group. It is a founding member of the Imperial College academic health sciences centre, the Francis Crick Institute and MedCity.\n\n\nImperial is a long-term partner of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with the first formal large-scale collaboration agreement dating back to 1944 as part of the Second World War scientific effort.[62] The two institutions still share a strong bond with exchange programs for their students and academic staff.[63][64]\n\n\nIn the field of Mathematics, Imperial College London has a joint venture with King's College London and University College London running the London School of Geometry and Number Theory, which offers doctoral training in mathematic aspects of number theory, geometry and topology.[65]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n###

Imperial is ranked 3rd in the world and 1st in Europe.[77]\n\n\nIn the 2019 Reuters World's Most Innovative Universities, Imperial is ranked 1st in innovation in the UK and 2nd in Europe.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Career prospects[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2019 Guardian University Guide and Complete University Guide, Imperial graduates are ranked 1st amongst UK universities in employment prospects.[79][80]\n\n\nA 2018 Department for Education report found that Imperial boosted female graduates earnings 31.3% above the average female graduate, and male graduates similarly saw a 25.3% increase in earnings above the average male graduate.[81]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], *The Guardian* notes that Imperial graduates pick up the highest salaries in the UK in the first year after graduation.[82]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nImperial was ranked 1st in the U.K overall in rankings produced by *Times Higher Education* based upon the Research Excellence Framework results 2021.[83][84]\n\n\nIn the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, 96.6% of Imperial's research is \u201cworld-leading\u201d (66.3% achieved the highest possible 4\\* score) or \u201cinternationally excellent\u201d (30.3% achieved 3\\*).[83][84] The REF found that 93% of Imperial's computer science research was found to be world-leading, achieving the highest possible 4\\* score.[85]\n\n\nThe college promotes research commercialisation, partly through its dedicated technology transfer company, Imperial Innovations, which has given rise to a large number of spin-out companies based on academic research.[86][87] Imperial was a critical contributor of the discovery of penicillin,[88] and the invention of fiber optics.[89]\n\n\n\nThe United States is the college's top collaborating foreign country, with more than 15,000 articles co-authored by Imperial and U.S.-based authors over the last ten years.[90] Imperial College has a long-term partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that dates back from World War II.[62]\n\n![](image)Innovation HubIn January 2018, the mathematics department of Imperial and the French National Center for Scientific Research launched UMI Abraham de Moivre at Imperial, a joint research laboratory of mathematics focused on unsolved problems and bridging British and French scientific communities.[91] In October 2018, Imperial College launched the Imperial Cancer Research UK Center, a research collaboration that aims to find innovative ways to improve the precision of cancer treatments, inaugurated by Joe Biden as part of his Biden Cancer Initiative.[92][93]\n\n\nNeil Ferguson's 16 March 2020 report entitled \"Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce COVID- 19 mortality and healthcare demand\" was described in a *New York Times* article, as the coronavirus \"report that jarred the U.S. and the U.K. to action\".[94][95] Since 18 May, Imperial College's Dr. Samir Bhatt has been advising the state of New York for its reopening plan.[96] The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said at the time that \"the Imperial College model, as we've been following this for weeks, was the best, most accurate model.\"[96]\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- |

Alexander Fleming Building\nIn the academic year 2021/22, Imperial had an admissions rate of 11.1% for undergraduate admissions and 13.0% for postgraduate admissions: The ratio of applicants to admissions was 9:1 for undergraduates and 7.7:1 for postgraduates.[104] \n\n![](image)St Mary's Hospital, London\nThe undergraduate courses with the highest ratios of applicants to admissions were computing (19.2:1), mathematics (14.6:1) and mechanical engineering (11.2:1).[104]\n\n\nThe postgraduate courses with the highest ratios of applicants to admissions were computing (21:1), mathematics (17.9:1), and electrical engineering (14:1).[104]\n\n\nImperial is among the most international universities in the United Kingdom,[105][106] with 50% of students from the UK, 16% of students from the EU, and 34% of students from outside the UK or EU.[105][107][108] The student body is 39% female and 61% male.[108] 36.5% of Imperial's undergraduates are privately educated, the fourth highest proportion amongst mainstream British universities.[106]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nThe college's main library is located next to Queen's Lawn and contains the main corpus of the college's collection. It previously also housed the Science Museum's library until 2014.[109] The Fleming library is located at St Mary's in Paddington, originally the library of St Mary's Hospital Medical School, with other hospital campuses also having college libraries.[110]\n\n\n\n### Medicine[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Imperial College Faculty of Medicine and Imperial College Healthcare\n\nThe Imperial Faculty of Medicine was formed through mergers between Imperial and the St Mary's, Charing Cross and Westminster, and Royal Postgraduate medical schools and has six teaching hospitals. It accepts more than 300 undergraduate medical students per year and has around 321 taught and 700 research full-time equivalent postgraduate students.\n\n\n\n![](image)Imperial College London Diabetes Centre, Abu Dhabi\nImperial College Healthcare NHS Trust was formed on 1 October 2007 by the merger of Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust (Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital and Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital) and St Mary's NHS Trust (St. Mary's Hospital and Western Eye Hospital) with Imperial College London Faculty of Medicine.[111] It is an academic health science centre and manages five hospitals: Charing Cross Hospital, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital, St Mary's Hospital, and Western Eye Hospital. The Trust is currently one of the largest in the UK and in 2012/13 had a turnover of \u00a3971.3 million, employed approximately 9,770 people and treated almost 1.2 million patients.[112]\n\n\nOther (non-academic health science centres) hospitals affiliated with Imperial College include Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Royal Brompton Hospital, West Middlesex University Hospital, Hillingdon Hospital, Mount Vernon Hospital, Harefield Hospital, Ealing Hospital, Central Middlesex Hospital, Northwick Park Hospital, St Mark's Hospital, St Charles' Hospital and St Peter's Hospital.[113]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Accusations of bullying[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, it was reported that one third of female academics \"believe that discrimination or bullying by managers has held back their careers\".[114] Imperial has since won the Athena SWAN Award, which recognises employment practices that are supportive of the careers of women in science, technology, engineering and maths.\n\n\nIn 2007, concerns were raised about the methods that were being used to fire people in the Faculty of Medicine.[115][116] In 2014, Stefan Grimm, of the Department of Medicine, was found dead after being threatened with dismissal for failure to raise enough grant money.[117] His last email before his death accused his employers of bullying by demanding that he should get grants worth at least \u00a3200,000 per year.[118][119] The college announced an internal inquiry into Stefan Grimm's death, and found that the performance metrics for his position were unreasonable, with new metrics for performance being needed.[120]\n\n\nThe issue of bullying within the staff at Imperial resurfaced in November 2020 when Alex Sobel, the Labour MP for Leeds North West asked the Secretary of State for Education in a written question on 24 November what steps the Office for Students had taken in response to a report by Jane McNeill QC dated 25 August which found that bullying had taken place at Imperial under the President (Alice Gast) and the Chief Financial Officer. Michelle Donelan, the Conservative MP for Chippenham, responded for the Department for Education that \"The Office for Students (OfS) is considering the information it has received in relation to this matter, in line with their normal processes. As is standard practice, the OfS cannot comment on individual cases\".[121] The college was accused of a cover-up by the Universities and Colleges Union in December 2020 when it refused to publish McNeill's report, even in redacted form. The Chair of Council said that the report was kept confidential to preserve the anonymity of people who gave evidence, that its recommendations had been accepted by the senior leadership team, and that these recommendations were being implemented in full. A disciplinary panel decided that Gast's dismissal as president was not warranted and spokesperson for the college said that she had \"offered wholehearted apologies to those affected\".[122]\n\n\nOn 14 February 2021, it was announced that the OfS would formally investigate allegations of bullying.[123]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Student body[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2019/20 academic year, Imperial had a total full-time student body of 19,400, consisting of 10,475 undergraduate students and 8,925 postgraduates.[124] 50.7% of the student body is from outside of the UK.[125] 32% of all full-time students came from outside the European Union in 2013\u201314,[126] and around 13% of the International students had Chinese nationality in 2007\u201308.[127]\n\n\nImperial's male to female ratio for undergraduate students is uneven at approximately 64:36 overall[127] and 5:1 or higher in some engineering courses. However, medicine has an approximate 1:1 ratio with biology degrees tending to be higher.[128]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nQueen's Lawn at South Kensington Campus\n\n### Imperial College Union[edit]\n\n\nImperial College Union is the students' union and is run by five full-time sabbatical officers elected from the student body for a tenure of one year, and a number of permanent members of staff. It is split into constituent unions aligned with the faculties of the college, carrying on the association with the original constituent colleges of Imperial, the Royal College of Science Union, City and Guilds College Union, Royal School of Mines Students' Union and Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union. The Union is given a large subvention by the university, much of which is spent on maintaining over 300 clubs, projects and societies.[129] Examples of notable student groups and projects are Project Nepal which sends Imperial College students to work on educational development programmes in rural Nepal[130] and the El Salvador Project, a construction based project in Central America.[131] The Union also hosts sports-related clubs such as Imperial College Boat Club and Imperial College Gliding Club.\n\n\nThe Union operates on two sites, with most events at the Union Building on Beit Quad at South Kensington, with mostly medical school events at the Reynold's bar, Charing Cross.\n\n\n\n### Facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ethos Gym\nSports facilities at Imperial's London campuses include four gyms, including the main Ethos gym at the South Kensington Campus, two swimming pools and two sports halls.[132] Imperial has additional sports facilities at the Heston and Harlington sports grounds.\n\n\nOn the South Kensington campus, there are a total of six music practice rooms which consist of upright pianos for usage by people of any grade, and grand pianos which are exclusively for people who have achieved Grade 8 or above.[133]\n\n\nThere are two student bars on the South Kensington campus, one at the Imperial College Union and one at Eastside.[134]\nThere are a number of pubs and bars on campus and also surrounding the campus, which become a popular social activity for Imperial's students. The Pewter tankard collection at Imperial College Union is the largest in Europe, with the majority of clubs and societies having tankards associated with their clubs.[135]\n\n\n\n![](image)The weekly college farmer's market\n### Student media[edit]\n\n\n#### Imperial College Radio[edit]\n\n\nImperial College Radio (ICRadio) was founded in November 1975 with the intention of broadcasting to the student halls of residence from a studio under Southside, actually commencing broadcasts in late 1976. It now broadcasts from the West Basement of Beit Quad over the internet.[136]\n\n\n\n#### Imperial College TV[edit]\n\n\nImperial College TV (ICTV) is Imperial College Union's TV station, founded in 1969 and operated from a small TV studio in the Electrical Engineering block. The department had bought an early AMPEX Type A 1-inch videotape recorder and this was used to produce an occasional short news programme which was then played to students by simply moving the VTR and a monitor into a common room. A cable link to the Southside halls of residence was laid in a tunnel under Exhibition Road in 1972. Besides the news, early productions included a film of the Queen opening what was then called College Block.\n\n\n\n#### Felix Newspaper[edit]\n\n\n*Felix* is weekly student newspaper, first released on 9 December 1949.[137] In addition to news, Felix also carries comic strips, features, opinions, puzzles and reviews, plus reports of trips and Imperial College sporting events.\n\n![](image)Racing Green Endurance is a student-led project to demonstrate the potential of zero-emission cars.\n### Student societies[edit]\n\n\n#### Imperial College Boat Club[edit]\n\n\nThe Imperial College Boat Club is the rowing club of Imperial and was founded on 12 December 1919. The college's boat house is located in Putney on the Thames, and was recently refurbished, reopening in 2014.[138] The club has a number of notable accolades, such as three alumni of the college in the gold medal-winning GB 8+ at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Sports[edit]\n\n\nImperial College has over 60 sports clubs,[139] of which many participate in the British Universities and Colleges Sport Association leagues such as American Football, Rugby, Badminton, Lacrosse, Football, Ice Hockey, and many others.[139]\n\n\n\n#### Exploration Club[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beit Hall![](image)Prince's Gardens in the snow, surrounded by college halls of residenceImperial's Exploration Board was established in 1957 to assist students with a desire for exploration. Trips have included Afghanistan, Alaska, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Fiji, the Himalayas, Iran, Morocco, Norway, Tanzania, Thailand, Ukraine, and the Yukon.[140]\n\n\n#### Dramatic Society[edit]\n\n\nThe Imperial College Dramatic Society (DramSoc[141]) is one of two major theatrical arts societies, with the other being the Musical Theatre Society, and it was founded in 1912.[142] The society puts on three major plays each year, in addition to several smaller fringe productions. It is additionally one of the London-based dramatic societies to participate in the London Student Drama Festival,[143] and regularly attends the Edinburgh Fringe. DramSoc is responsible for the day-to-day maintenance of the Union's theatrical space, the Union Concert Hall.\n\n\n\n#### The Techtonics[edit]\n\n\nThe Techtonics are an all-male a cappella group from Imperial College London, and are a part of the Imperial College A Cappella Society.[144] The group was formed in 2008, and has since risen to prominence in the world a cappella scene. The group is best known for winning the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella in 2016.[145]\n\n\n\n### Student housing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Imperial College Halls of Residence\n\nImperial College owns and manages twenty-three halls of residence in Inner London, Acton, and Ascot. Over three thousand rooms are available, guaranteeing first year undergraduates a place in College residences.\n\n\nThe majority of halls offer single or twin accommodation with some rooms having en suite facilities. Bedrooms are provided with basic furniture and with access to shared kitchens and bathrooms. All rooms come with internet access and access to the Imperial network.[146] Most of them are considered among the newest student halls at London universities.\n\n\nMost students in college or university accommodation are first-year undergraduates, as they are granted a room once they have selected Imperial as their firm offer with UCAS. The majority of older students and postgraduates find accommodation in the private sector, help for which is provided by the college private housing office. However a handful of students may continue to live in halls in later years if they take the position of a \"hall senior\", and places are available for a small number of returning students in the Evelyn Garden halls.[147] Some students also live in International Students House, London.\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni, faculty and staff[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Imperial College London, List of Imperial College London people, and President of Imperial College London\n\n* ![Sir Cyril Norman Hinshelwood](image)\n\nSir Cyril Norman Hinshelwood\n* ![Rajiv Gandhi, 6th Prime Minister of India[c]](image)\n\nRajiv Gandhi, 6th Prime Minister of India[c]\n* ![Abdus Salam](image)\n\nAbdus Salam\n* ![Sir Alexander Fleming](image)\n\nSir Alexander Fleming\n* ![Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett](image)\n\nPatrick Blackett, Baron Blackett\n* ![Sir William Crookes](image)\n\nSir William Crookes\n* ![Thomas Huxley](image)\n\nThomas Huxley\n* ![Sir John Pendry](image)\n\nSir John Pendry\n* ![H.G.

The scheme came to be known as the 'LLA examination' (Lady Literate in Arts). It required women to pass five subjects at an ordinary level and one at honours level and entitled them to hold a diploma from the university. Not being required to attend the university in person, the women were learning by correspondence, taking as many years as needed to complete the course. They were both examined and assisted in their studies by educationalists in the town or city in which they lived in the UK or abroad.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUniversity of St Andrews| ![Crest of the University of St Andrews](image)Shield of the University of St Andrews\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Sancti Andreae apud Scotos* |\n| Motto | Ancient Greek: \u0391\u1f30\u1f72\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd(Aien aristeuein)[1]\n |\n| Motto in\u00a0English\n | Ever to ExcelorEver to be the Best |\n| Type | Public research university\nAncient university |\n| Established | 1413; 611\u00a0years ago\u00a0(1413)[2] |\n| Academic affiliations\n | EUAEuropaeumUniversities ScotlandUniversities UKWallace Group  Sutton 13  |\n| Endowment | \u00a3113.1 million (2022)[3] |\n| Budget | \u00a3305.7 million (2021\u201322)[3] |\n| Chancellor | The Lord Campbell of Pittenweem |\n| Rector | Stella Maris |\n| Principal | Dame Sally Mapstone |\n| Academic staff\n | 1,355 (2021/22)[4] |\n| Administrative staff\n | 1,700 (2021/22)[4] |\n| Students | 11,820 (2021/22)[5] |\n| Undergraduates | 9,345 (2021/22)[5] |\n| Postgraduates | 2,475 (2021/22)[5] |\n| Location | St Andrews\n, Scotland\n |\n| Campus | College town |\n| Colours | United College, St Andrews\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthe acceptance rate was 8.35% and the offer rate was 22.5% for Scottish/EU applicants where places are capped by the Scottish Government.[110][111] In 2017, the most competitive courses for Scottish/EU applicants were those within the Schools of International Relations, Management, and Economics and Finance with offer rates of 8.0%, 10.9% and 11.5% respectively.[110][112] The university has a higher proportion of female than male students with a female ratio of 59.7% in the undergraduate population.[113]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** \"Literate Ladies \u2013 A fifty year experiment\" (PDF).

As well as losing the right to confer the undergraduate medical degree MBChB, it was also deprived of the right to confer the postgraduate degree MD. St Andrews was eventually able to continue to offer the opportunity to study medicine through a new arrangement with the University of Manchester in England.\n\n\nIn 1972, the College of St Leonard was reconstituted as a postgraduate institute.[38]\n\n\n\n### Links with the United States[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's list of alumni **may not follow Wikipedia's verifiability policy**.

In a particularly acute depression in 1747, severe financial problems triggered the dissolution of St Leonard's College, whose properties and staff were merged into St Salvator's College to form the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard.[15] Throughout this period student numbers were very low; for instance, when Samuel Johnson visited the university in 1773, the university had fewer than 100 students, and was in his opinion in a steady decline. He described it as \"pining in decay and struggling for life\".[24] The poverty of Scotland during this period also damaged St Andrews, as few were able to patronise the university and its colleges, and with state support being improbable, the income they received was scarce.\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Sporting affiliations\n | University of St Andrews Athletic Union |\n| Website | st-andrews.ac.uk ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n\n\nThe **University of St Andrews** (Scots: *University o St Andras*, Scottish Gaelic: *Oilthigh Chill R\u00ecmhinn*;[6] abbreviated as **St And**, from the Latin *Sancti Andreae*, in post-nominals) is a public university in St Andrews, Scotland. It is the oldest of the four ancient universities of Scotland and, following the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the third-oldest university in the English-speaking world. St Andrews was founded in 1413 when the Avignon Antipope Benedict XIII issued a papal bull to a small founding group of Augustinian clergy. Along with the universities of Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh, St Andrews was part of the Scottish Enlightenment during the 18th century.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Arts University Plymouth\n* Portsmouth\n* Reading\n* Royal Agricultural\n* Solent\n* Southampton\n* Surrey\n* Sussex\n* UWE Bristol\n* Winchester\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSt Andrews is made up of a variety of institutions, comprising three colleges\u00a0\u2014 United College (a union of St Salvator's and St Leonard's Colleges), St Mary's College, and St Leonard's College, the last named being a non-statutory revival of St Leonard's as a post-graduate society. There are 18 academic schools organised into four faculties.[7] The university occupies historic and modern buildings located throughout the town. The academic year is divided into two semesters, Martinmas and Candlemas. In term time, over one-third of the town's population are either staff members or students of the university.[8] The student body is known for preserving ancient traditions such as Raisin Weekend, May Dip, and the wearing of distinctive academic dress.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlumni in the fields of academia and education have gone on to found the University of Melbourne Medical School (Anthony Brownless) and the Scottish Church College in Calcutta (Alexander Duff was also the first Scottish missionary to India), become the first Regent and first principal of the University of Edinburgh (Robert Rollock), dean of Harvard Divinity School (David Hempton), the Vice Chancellors of Aberdeen University (Ian Diamond), University of Nottingham (Shearer West), Open University (Walter Perry was also the first vice-chancellor) and Sydney University (Gavin Brown), chancellor of the University of Maine System (James H.

Martinmas, on 11 November, was originally the feast of Saint Martin of Tours, a fourth-century bishop and hermit. Candlemas originally fell on 2 February, the day of the feast of the Purification, or the Presentation of Christ. Martinmas semester runs from early September until mid-December, with examinations taking place just before the Christmas break. There follows an inter-semester period when Martinmas semester business is concluded and preparations are made for the new Candlemas semester, which starts in January and concludes with examinations in April and May. Most Undergraduate graduations are celebrated in mid-June with Postgraduate graduations being celebrated in late November.[72]\n\n\n\n### Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnder a new foundation and erection, confirmed by Parliament in 1579, it was set apart for the study of Theology only, and it has remained a Divinity College ever since.[22][23]\n\n\nSome university buildings that date from this period are still in use today, such as St Salvator's Chapel, St Leonard's College Chapel and St Mary's College quadrangle. At this time, the majority of the teaching was of a religious nature and was conducted by clerics associated with the cathedral.\n\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSt Andrews has many notable alumni and affiliated faculty, including eminent mathematicians, scientists, theologians, philosophers, and politicians. Recent alumni include the former first minister of Scotland Alex Salmond; former Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill; former Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) Alex Younger; Olympic cycling gold medalist Chris Hoy; Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations Dame Barbara Woodward; and royals William, Prince of Wales, and Catherine, Princess of Wales. Five Nobel laureates are among St Andrews' alumni and former staff: three in Chemistry and two in Physiology or Medicine.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the University of St Andrews\n\n### Foundation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSt Andrews is characterised amongst Scottish universities as having a significant number of students who live in university-maintained accommodation. As of 2012, 52% of the student population lives in university halls.[150] The halls vary widely in age and character; the oldest, Deans Court dates from the 12th century, and the newest, Whitehorn Hall, built in 2018.[151] They are built in styles from Gothic revival to brutalist. All are now co-educational and non-smoking, and several are catered.[152] The university guarantees every first-year student a place of accommodation, and many students return to halls in their second, third and final years at St Andrews.[153] From September 2015 onward, students have had the option of living in alcohol-free flats in David Russell Apartments on the grounds of medical conditions that do not allow drinking or for religious reasons.[154]\n\n\n\n![](image)St Salvator's Hall\nHalls of residence include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** \"A brief history of the University\".

In response to the need for modernisation and in order to increase student numbers and alleviate financial problems, the university had, by 1883, established a university college in Dundee which formally merged with St Andrews in 1897.[35] From its inception, the Dundee college had a focus on scientific, and professional subjects; the college's mixed sexes read Classics and English at St Andrews. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**University Blessing:**\n\n\n> *Sit nomen Domini Benedictum per Jesum Christum salvatorem nostrum.
