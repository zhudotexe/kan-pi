The ruling DPP nominated Vice President Lai Ching-te in March 2023, having already secured the party chairmanship by acclamation. New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-ih of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) was selected to be the party’s presidential nominee in May 2023. Despite previously saying he would support Hou’s nomination, businessman Terry Gou declared his own independent bid in September 2023. The Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) has nominated its leader, Ko Wen-je, the former Mayor of Taipei. \n\n\nOn 15 November 2023, leadership of the KMT and the TPP announced that they would field a single joint presidential ticket, with the parties' previously chosen nominees serving as presidential and vice-presidential candidates. The order was to be chosen based on opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November,[3] but the two sides were unable to come to an agreement on that date, leaving the fate of the proposed joint ticket in doubt.[4]\n\n\nDomestic issues, such as energy policy, national defense and economic development have featured as campaign issues in the election, coupled by foreign issues mostly concerning Taiwan’s Cross-Strait relations with Mainland China, and relations with the United States.[5][6]\n\n\nAs of 14 November 2023, four presidential candidates have been nominated by a party or qualified as an independent, making the election the most contested since 2000. The winner of the 2024 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on 20 May 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsai Ing-wen, the incumbent President of the Republic of China is ineligible to seek re-election after serving two consecutive terms.\nPresidential candidates and Vice Presidential running mates are elected on the same ticket, using first-past-the-post voting. This will be the eighth direct election of the president and vice president, the posts having previously been indirectly elected by the National Assembly until 1996.\n\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the constitution, the incumbent President, Tsai Ing-wen, who will finish her second full term, is ineligible for re-election. Under the Article 22 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Act, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwan People's Party (TPP) and New Power Party (NPP), which received more than five per cent of the total vote share in any of the latest general election (presidential or legislative), are eligible to contest the election. Registration with the Central Election Commission as the candidates for President and Vice President is filed by the way of political party recommendation where a letter of recommendation stamped with the political party's seal issued by the Ministry of the Interior shall be submitted together with the application. Under Article 23, independent candidates and smaller parties are also eligible to contest, registering as the candidates for President and Vice President by the way of joint signature shall, within five days after the public notice for election is issued, apply to the Central Election Commission for being the presenter recommended by way of joint signature, receive a list of joint signers and to receive 1.5 per cent of the total electors in the latest election of the members of the Legislative Yuan, and pay the deposit of NT$1,000,000.[7][*original research?*] For the 2024 presidential election, the number of signatures required for independent candidates is approximately 290,000.[8] The complete petition is to be submitted between 13 and 17 September 2023, and the signature collection period follows from 17 September to 2 November 2023.[9] Presidential candidacies are to be formally registered between 20 and 24 November 2023.[10]\n\n\n\n### Timetable[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Key Dates\n |\n| --- |\n| Date\n | Event\n |\n| 15 March 2023\n | The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) officially nominates Vice President Lai Ching-te as the party's presidential nominee.\n |\n| 8 May 2023\n | The Taiwan People's Party (TPP) officially nominates former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je as the party's presidential nominee.\n |\n| 17 May 2023\n | The Kuomintang Party (KMT) officially nominates New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-ih as the party's presidential nominee.\n |\n| 28 August 2023\n | Businessman Terry Gou declares his candidacy for the Presidency as an independent.\n |\n| 12 September-4 December 2023\n | Accepting applications for the election of the President and Vice President and registration of electors who return to the country to exercise their right to vote.\n |\n| 14 September 2023\n | Terry Gou selects actress Lai Pei-hsia as his running mate.\n |\n| 13 November 2023\n | Gou qualifies to run in the presidential election.\n |\n| 13 November 2023\n | The KMT and TPP agree to use polling to determine the formation of a joint-ticket.\n |\n| 14 November 2023\n | Announcement of the signature results of the presidential and vice presidential election.\n |\n| 13 January 2024\n | Voting will be held from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n |\n| 20 May 2024\n | The next President will be inaugurated on 20 May 2024.\n |\n\n\n## Nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

Tsai resigned as DPP Chair in 2022, following the party’s poor performance in the local elections of that year.[11] After Tsai’s resignation, Vice President Lai Ching-te (also known as William Lai) was unanimously elected to succeed her as Chair of the DPP.[12] Lai was previously selected to be Tsai’s running mate after she defeated him in the 2020 primary.[13] No primary was held, and Lai Ching-te, being the only individual to register in the party's presidential primary, is the nominee of the Democratic Progressive Party.[14][15][16]\n\n\nIn November 2023, it was reported that Lai was considering selecting Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan’s envoy to the United States, as his running mate.[17]\n\n\n\n#### Nominees[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)**2024 Democratic Progressive ticket** |\n| Lai Ching-te | TBD |\n| ***for President*** | ***for Vice President*** |\n| ![](image) |  |\n| Vice President of the Republic of China(2020–present) |  |\n\n\n### Kuomintang[edit]\n\n\nHou Yu-ih, the Mayor of New Taipei since 2018, was drafted by the Kuomintang on 17 May 2023 to be its nominee for the presidency.[18] Hou faced opposition from Foxconn founder Terry Gou, who vowed to support him as the KMT’s nominee.[19]\n\n\n\n#### Nominees[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)**2024 Kuomintang ticket** |\n| Hou Yu-ih | TBD |\n| ***for President*** | ***for Vice President*** |\n| ![](image) |  |\n| Mayor of New Taipei(2018–present) |  |\n\n\n### Taiwan People's Party[edit]\n\n\nKo Wen-je, being the only individual to register in the party's presidential primary, is the nominee of the Taiwan People's Party.[20][21]\n\n\n\n#### Nominees[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)**2024 Taiwan People's ticket** |\n| Ko Wen-je | TBD |\n| ***for President*** | ***for Vice President*** |\n| ![](image) |  |\n| Mayor of Taipei(2014–2022) |  |\n\n\n### Other parties and independents[edit]\n\n\nAll independent and minor party candidates need a minimum of 290,000 signatures to register with the Central Election Commision.[22]\n\n\n\n#### Terry Gou[edit]\n\n\nBillionaire businessman Terry Gou, who founded the global technology manufacturing company Foxconn in 1974, declared his own presidential run as an independent candidate on 28 August 2023.[23] This was despite previously stating he would support Kuomintang nominee Hou Yu-ih. The KMT described Gou’s announcement as ‘deeply regrettable’.[24] Lai Ching-te welcomed Gou’s entrance into the race, saying he would be happy to take on the challenge.[25] Gou was the first of the mainstream candidates to announce his running mate; he selected actress Lai Pei-hsia [zh] (otherwise known as Tammy Lai) as his running mate on 14 September.[26] Lai had previously played a fictional Taiwanese presidential candidate on a Chinese-language Netflix series, Wave Makers.[27] Gou’s campaign was mired by allegations that it was buying signatures.[28] By November 2023, at least 20 separate investigations into fraudulent practices and signature forgeries were opened.[29] 7 people were arrested in what was described as a ‘signature-buying scheme’ a few weeks earlier.[30] Gou denied these allegations, and claimed that individuals who were buying signatures were acting on their own accord and were not part of his official campaign. Gou submitted his signatures on 1 November 2023.[31] On 13 November, over 900,000 of Gou’s submitted signatures were validated by the election commission, qualifying him to run the presidential election.[32]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)**2024 Independent politician ticket** |\n| Terry Gou | Lai Pei-hsia |\n| ***for President*** | ***for Vice President*** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Founder and CEO of Foxconn(1974–2019) | Writer, singer, actor\n |\n\n\n#### Withdrawn candidates[edit]\n\n\n* **Wang Chien-shien** (independent), President of Control Yuan (2008–2014)[33]\n* **Su Huan-chih** (Taiwan Renewal Party), Tainan County Magistrate (2001–2010)\n\n\n#### Disqualified candidates[edit]\n\n\nNine of ten third-party or independent presidential tickets did not meet the signature petition requirements set by the Central Election Commission, and were disqualified from the election. Only five presidential candidates and their running mates attempted to submit signatures.[34]\n\n\n\n* **Chen Mei-fei [zh]** and Wu Chao-sheng (巫超勝) 256,773 signatures submitted, 2 valid endorsements\n* **Cheng Tzu-tsai** and Huang Sheng-feng [zh] (Sovereign State for Formosa and Pescadores Party [zh]) 608 signatures submitted, 478 valid endorsements\n* **Lan Hsin-chi [zh]** and Chou Ke-chi (周克琦) 146 signatures submitted, 58 valid endorsements\n* **Fu Yin** (符音) and Hsieh Tsu-hsuan (謝祖鉉) 113 signatures submitted, 91 valid endorsements\n\n\n## Election campaign[edit]\n\n\nThroughout the election campaign, almost all polls have showed Vice President William Lai winning the election by a plurality (~32%), with the rest of the vote being split between the KMT and TPP.[35] Lai’s lead increased in September 2023, when Terry Gou announced his own independent bid for the presidency.[36] In August 2023, amid campaiging, Lai Ching-te went to Paraguay for an official visit in his capacity as Vice President, with two stopovers in the United States.[37] Lai insisted he was not campaigning during the trips.[38] In late October, China opened an investigation into Foxconn, after Chinese tax authorities conducted an audit of the company’s subsidies in the Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces.[39]\n\n\n\n### Possible KMT–TPP joint ticket[edit]\n\n\nIn late 2023, talks of a possible joint ticket between the KMT and TPP began.[40] It was initially unclear if the KMT’s Hou Yu-ih and the TPP’s Ko Wen-je will join as a ticket, let alone who will be the nominee for president and vice president once a joint ticket was announced.[41] The DPP’s Lai stated he would be able to take on the challenge of a joint ticket, and criticised the coalition plans, arguing the two parties do not share enough similarity in ideology.[42] In November, Ko said that deciding who would lead the ticket as the presidential nominee was the ‘only hurdle’ remaining in forming the ticket.[43] On 13 November, the KMT and TPP agreed to use polling to determine the composition of the joint presidential ticket.[44]\n\n\n\n## Opinion

The ruling DPP nominated Vice President Lai Ching-te in March 2023, having already secured the party chairmanship by acclamation. New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-ih of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) was selected to be the party’s presidential nominee in May 2023. Despite previously saying he would support Hou’s nomination, businessman Terry Gou declared his own independent bid in September 2023. The Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) has nominated its leader, Ko Wen-je, the former Mayor of Taipei. \n\n\nOn 15 November 2023, leadership of the KMT and the TPP announced that they would field a single joint presidential ticket, with the parties' previously chosen nominees serving as presidential and vice-presidential candidates. The order was to be chosen based on opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November,[3] but the two sides were unable to come to an agreement on that date, leaving the fate of the proposed joint ticket in doubt.[4]\n\n\nDomestic issues, such as energy policy, national defense and economic development have featured as campaign issues in the election, coupled by foreign issues mostly concerning Taiwan’s Cross-Strait relations with Mainland China, and relations with the United States.[5][6]\n\n\nAs of 14 November 2023, four presidential candidates have been nominated by a party or qualified as an independent, making the election the most contested since 2000. The winner of the 2024 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on 20 May 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsai Ing-wen, the incumbent President of the Republic of China is ineligible to seek re-election after serving two consecutive terms.\nPresidential candidates and Vice Presidential running mates are elected on the same ticket, using first-past-the-post voting. This will be the eighth direct election of the president and vice president, the posts having previously been indirectly elected by the National Assembly until 1996.\n\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the constitution, the incumbent President, Tsai Ing-wen, who will finish her second full term, is ineligible for re-election.

Tsai resigned as DPP Chair in 2022, following the party’s poor performance in the local elections of that year.[11] After Tsai’s resignation, Vice President Lai Ching-te (also known as William Lai) was unanimously elected to succeed her as Chair of the DPP.[12] Lai was previously selected to be Tsai’s running mate after she defeated him in the 2020 primary.[13] No primary was held, and Lai Ching-te, being the only individual to register in the party's presidential primary, is the nominee of the Democratic Progressive Party.[14][15][16]\n\n\nIn November 2023, it was reported that Lai was considering selecting Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan’s envoy to the United States, as his running mate.[17]\n\n\n\n#### Nominees[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)**2024 Democratic Progressive ticket** |\n| Lai Ching-te | TBD |\n| ***for President*** | ***for Vice President*** |\n| ![](image) |  |\n| Vice President of the Republic of China(2020–present) |  |\n\n\n### Kuomintang[edit]\n\n\nHou Yu-ih, the Mayor of New Taipei since 2018, was drafted by the Kuomintang on 17 May 2023 to be its nominee for the presidency.[18] Hou faced opposition from Foxconn founder Terry Gou, who vowed to support him as the KMT’s nominee.[19]\n\n\n\n#### Nominees[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)**2024 Kuomintang ticket** |\n| Hou Yu-ih | TBD |\n| ***for President*** | ***for Vice President*** |\n| ![](image) |  |\n| Mayor of New Taipei(2018–present) |  |\n\n\n### Taiwan People's Party[edit]\n\n\nKo Wen-je, being the only individual to register in the party's presidential primary, is the nominee of the Taiwan People's Party.[20][21]\n\n\n\n#### Nominees[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)**2024 Taiwan People's ticket** |\n| Ko Wen-je | TBD |\n| ***for President*** | ***for Vice President*** |\n| ![](image) |  |\n| Mayor of Taipei(2014–2022) |  |\n\n\n### Other parties and independents[edit]\n\n\nAll independent and minor party candidates need a minimum of 290,000 signatures to register with the Central Election Commision.[22]\n\n\n\n#### Terry Gou[edit]\n\n\nBillionaire businessman Terry Gou, who founded the global technology manufacturing company Foxconn in 1974, declared his own presidential run as an independent candidate on 28 August 2023.[23] This was despite previously stating he would support Kuomintang nominee Hou Yu-ih. The KMT described Gou’s announcement as ‘deeply regrettable’.[24] Lai Ching-te welcomed Gou’s entrance into the race, saying he would be happy to take on the challenge.[25] Gou was the first of the mainstream candidates to announce his running mate; he selected actress Lai Pei-hsia [zh] (otherwise known as Tammy Lai) as his running mate on 14 September.[26] Lai had previously played a fictional Taiwanese presidential candidate on a Chinese-language Netflix series, Wave Makers.[27] Gou’s campaign was mired by allegations that it was buying signatures.[28] By November 2023, at least 20 separate investigations into fraudulent practices and signature forgeries were opened.[29] 7 people were arrested in what was described as a ‘signature-buying scheme’ a few weeks earlier.[30] Gou denied these allegations, and claimed that individuals who were buying signatures were acting on their own accord and were not part of his official campaign. Gou submitted his signatures on 1 November 2023.[31] On 13 November, over 900,000 of Gou’s submitted signatures were validated by the election commission, qualifying him to run the presidential election.[32]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)**2024 Independent politician ticket** |\n| Terry Gou | Lai Pei-hsia |\n| ***for President*** | ***for Vice President*** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Founder and CEO of Foxconn(1974–2019) | Writer, singer, actor\n |\n\n\n#### Withdrawn candidates[edit]\n\n\n* **Wang Chien-shien** (independent), President of Control Yuan (2008–2014)[33]\n* **Su Huan-chih** (Taiwan Renewal Party), Tainan County Magistrate (2001–2010)\n\n\n#### Disqualified candidates[edit]\n\n\nNine of ten third-party or independent presidential tickets did not meet the signature petition requirements set by the Central Election Commission, and were disqualified from the election. Only five presidential candidates and their running mates attempted to submit signatures.[34]\n\n\n\n* **Chen Mei-fei [zh]** and Wu Chao-sheng (巫超勝) 256,773 signatures submitted, 2 valid endorsements\n* **Cheng Tzu-tsai** and Huang Sheng-feng [zh] (Sovereign State for Formosa and Pescadores Party [zh]) 608 signatures submitted, 478 valid endorsements\n* **Lan Hsin-chi [zh]** and Chou Ke-chi (周克琦) 146 signatures submitted, 58 valid endorsements\n* **Fu Yin** (符音) and Hsieh Tsu-hsuan (謝祖鉉) 113 signatures submitted, 91 valid endorsements\n\n\n## Election campaign[edit]\n\n\nThroughout the election campaign, almost all polls have showed Vice President William Lai winning the election by a plurality (~32%), with the rest of the vote being split between the KMT and TPP.[35] Lai’s lead increased in September 2023, when Terry Gou announced his own independent bid for the presidency.[36] In August 2023, amid campaiging, Lai Ching-te went to Paraguay for an official visit in his capacity as Vice President, with two stopovers in the United States.[37] Lai insisted he was not campaigning during the trips.[38] In late October, China opened an investigation into Foxconn, after Chinese tax authorities conducted an audit of the company’s subsidies in the Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces.[39]\n\n\n\n### Possible KMT–TPP joint ticket[edit]\n\n\nIn late 2023, talks of a possible joint ticket between the KMT and TPP began.[40] It was initially unclear if the KMT’s Hou Yu-ih and the TPP’s Ko Wen-je will join as a ticket, let alone who will be the nominee for president and vice president once a joint ticket was announced.[41] The DPP’s Lai stated he would be able to take on the challenge of a joint ticket, and criticised the coalition plans, arguing the two parties do not share enough similarity in ideology.[42] In November, Ko said that deciding who would lead the ticket as the presidential nominee was the ‘only hurdle’ remaining in forming the ticket.[43] On 13 November, the KMT and TPP agreed to use polling to determine the composition of the joint presidential ticket.[44]\n\n\n\n## Opinion

He served as a legislator in the Legislative Yuan from 1999 to 2010, and as Mayor of Tainan from 2010 to 2017, prior to taking office as premier of Taiwan.[5]\n\n\nOn 24 November 2018, he announced his intention to resign from the premiership after the Democratic Progressive Party suffered a major defeat in local elections, and left office on 14 January 2019 after the swearing-in of his successor Su Tseng-chang.[6][7] Lai mounted a challenge against Tsai in the 2019 Democratic Progressive Party presidential primary and after defeat, served as the running mate of President Tsai Ing-wen in the 2020 Taiwan presidential election in which the tandem was victorious.[8][9] In April 2023, Lai was nominated by the DPP as their presidential candidate for the 2024 Taiwan presidential election.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Wanli, a rural coastal town in northern Taipei County (now New Taipei City) on 6 October 1959, Lai underwent schooling in Taipei City and studied at both National Cheng Kung University in Tainan and National Taiwan University in Taipei, where he specialized in rehabilitation.[10] Lai then studied at the Harvard School of Public Health for a Master's degree in Public Health,[10] followed by an internship at National Cheng Kung University Hospital. He became an expert on spinal cord damage and served as a national consultant for such injuries.[10]\n\n\n\n## Legislative career[edit]\n\n\nAfter serving as part of the support team for Chen Ding-nan's unsuccessful electoral bid for Governor of Taiwan Province in 1994,[11] Lai decided to enter politics himself. The next opportunity for election to a national body was the 1996 National Assembly, with Lai winning a seat representing Tainan City. Lai then joined the New Tide faction and stood as a candidate in the 1998 Legislative Yuan election, representing the Democratic Progressive Party in the second ward of Tainan City.[12][10] He was successful in this election, and subsequently was reelected three times in 2001, 2004, and 2008. In total he served 11 years as a legislator, and was selected as Taiwan's \"Best Legislator\" four times in a row by Taipei-based NGO Citizen Congress Watch.[13]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Tainan (2010–2017)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2010 Taiwanese local elections and 2014 Taiwanese local elections\n\n![](image)Lai as Mayor of Tainan, 2017.\nWith the 2010 reorganization of the municipalities in Taiwan, Tainan City and Tainan County were amalgamated into a single municipality, called Tainan. After successfully being selected in the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) primaries in January 2010,[14] Lai stood as the DPP candidate for the mayoral election on 27 November 2010, gaining 60.41% to defeat Kuomintang candidate Kuo Tien-tsai.[15][16] He took office on 25 December 2010.\n\n\nAs a result of his strong showing in the mayoral election coupled with his relative youth and his control of the DPP heartland city of Tainan, Lai was considered to be a potential candidate for a presidential run in 2016.[17] In 2013 an opinion poll ranked Lai as the most popular of the 22 city and county heads in Taiwan, with an approval rating of 87%.[18]\n\n\nLai made on 5 June 2014 a visit to the city of Shanghai to assist an exhibition of art by the late Taiwanese painter Tan Ting-pho and met politicians of the Chinese Communist Party.[19][20]\n\n\nLai stood for reelection on 29 November 2014 against Huang Hsiu-shuang of the Kuomintang. His opponent was considered to have such an uphill task in the DPP stronghold that she rode a black horse through the streets of Tainan as an election stunt; a hopeful allusion to her status as a \"dark horse\".[21] Lai, on the other hand, did not plan many campaign activities, choosing to focus on mayoral duties.[22] He eventually won the election by 45 percentage points,[23][24] the largest margin of victory in any of the municipal races in the election.[25]\n\n\nLai stepped down as Mayor in September 2017, after being appointed to the Premiership.[26] He was succeeded in acting capacity by Lee Meng-yen.[27]\n\n\n\n## Premier (2017–2019)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lai cabinet\n\n![](image)Premier Lai Ching-te led the cabinet during the swearing-in ceremony\n![](image)William Lai (center) with Ethan Tu (left) and Huang Wei-cher (right), in January 2019.\nIn September 2017, Premier Lin Chuan tendered his resignation to President Tsai Ing-wen, which was reluctantly accepted. A recent poll showed Lin's approve rating to be a mere 28.7%, with 6 in 10 respondents dissatisfied with the performance of his cabinet.[28] On 5 September, President Tsai announced at a press conference that Lai would become the country's next head of the Executive Yuan.[29]\n\n\nLai took office on 8 September as the 49th Premier of the Republic of China.[30] Following Lai's appointment as premier, Tsai's approval ratings reached 46%, rebounding by more than 16 points since August.[31] Lai made his first appearance as premier at the Legislative Yuan on 26 September, where he stated \"I am a political worker who advocates Taiwan independence\" but that \"We are already an independent sovereign nation called the Republic of China. We don't need a separate declaration of independence\".[32][33] Lai has appeared to have moderated his position on Taiwanese independence particularly when he proposed the idea of \"being close to China while loving Taiwan\" in June 2017.[34] He also expressed no desire to run against Tsai Ing-wen in the 2020 presidential election.[35] On 28 September, the New Party called on the KMT to join it in filing a formal complaint against the Premier for sedition.[36]\n\n\nIn October 2017, it was reported that Lai had garnered the approval of 68.8 percent of respondents in a survey, while 23 percent expressed dissatisfaction.[37] However, critics say that his popularity may not last, due to his rapid reversal of his position on the issue of Taiwanese independence.[38] However, on 20 October, Lai in response to General Secretary Xi Jinping's comments on the one China policy and the 1992 consensus at the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Lai said that the Taiwanese government, following the directives of Tsai Ing-wen, would fulfill its promise of not changing the status quo between the two neighbors and not ceding before pressure from Beijing, which comes in the form of military intimidation and an international blockade.[39]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Lai tendered his resignation to the president, after the ruling DPP was trounced in local elections.[40] Lai agreed to remain in office to help stabilize the government until the general budget was cleared by the Legislative Yuan in January 2019.[41][42] Lai's cabinet resigned on 11 January 2019 and Su Tseng-chang was appointed as new premier.[43][44]\n\n\n\n## First presidential campaign (2019)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2019 Democratic Progressive Party presidential primary and 2020 Taiwanese presidential election\n\nOn 18 March 2019, Lai Ching-te registered to run in the Democratic Progressive Party presidential primary, saying that he could shoulder the responsibility of leading Taiwan in defending itself from being annexed by China.[45] This is the first time in Taiwanese history where a serious primary challenge has been mounted against a sitting president.[46] The results of the DPP's primary poll released on 13 June shown that Tsai defeated Lai by winning 35.67 percent of the vote over Lai's 27.48 percent, officially becoming the DPP's presidential candidate for the 2020 election.[47]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Lai accepted president Tsai Ing-wen's offer to become her running mate for the 2020 presidential election.[48] Tsai secured over 57% of the ballot, winning a record 8.17 million votes in the election and began her second term in 2020.[49][50]\n\n\n\n## Vice presidency and second presidential campaign (2020–2024)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lai exchanging gifts with Palaun President Surangel Whipps Jr. (left) on an official visit to Palau in November 2022\nDuring his vice presidency, Lai served as president Tsai Ing-wen's special envoy to Honduras for president Xiomara Castro's inauguration in January 2022.[51] After the assassination of former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, he made a private trip to Tokyo to pay his respects and became Taiwan's most senior official to visit Japan in five decades.[52] In November 2022, Lai led representatives of Taiwan's travel agencies and industry associations to Palau to foster collaborations between the two countries.[53]\n\n\nIn November 2022, president Tsai Ing-wen resigned as leader of DPP after the party's heavy losses in local elections.[54] Lai officially registered as a candidate for the DPP chair election in December.[55] Since Lai was the only candidate running, he became the new chairman of the DPP in 2023.[56][57] In March 2023, Lai registered as the only person to run in the DPP's 2024 presidential primary and was officially nominated by the ruling party in April.[58][59]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** Taiwan\n2. **^** \"Lai bids farewell to Tainan, names Lee Meng-yen as acting mayor\". *Focus Taiwan*. 6 September 2017.

He served as a legislator in the Legislative Yuan from 1999 to 2010, and as Mayor of Tainan from 2010 to 2017, prior to taking office as premier of Taiwan.[5]\n\n\nOn 24 November 2018, he announced his intention to resign from the premiership after the Democratic Progressive Party suffered a major defeat in local elections, and left office on 14 January 2019 after the swearing-in of his successor Su Tseng-chang.[6][7] Lai mounted a challenge against Tsai in the 2019 Democratic Progressive Party presidential primary and after defeat, served as the running mate of President Tsai Ing-wen in the 2020 Taiwan presidential election in which the tandem was victorious.[8][9] In April 2023, Lai was nominated by the DPP as their presidential candidate for the 2024 Taiwan presidential election.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Wanli, a rural coastal town in northern Taipei County (now New Taipei City) on 6 October 1959, Lai underwent schooling in Taipei City and studied at both National Cheng Kung University in Tainan and National Taiwan University in Taipei, where he specialized in rehabilitation.[10] Lai then studied at the Harvard School of Public Health for a Master's degree in Public Health,[10] followed by an internship at National Cheng Kung University Hospital. He became an expert on spinal cord damage and served as a national consultant for such injuries.[10]\n\n\n\n## Legislative career[edit]\n\n\nAfter serving as part of the support team for Chen Ding-nan's unsuccessful electoral bid for Governor of Taiwan Province in 1994,[11] Lai decided to enter politics himself. The next opportunity for election to a national body was the 1996 National Assembly, with Lai winning a seat representing Tainan City. Lai then joined the New Tide faction and stood as a candidate in the 1998 Legislative Yuan election, representing the Democratic Progressive Party in the second ward of Tainan City.[12][10] He was successful in this election, and subsequently was reelected three times in 2001, 2004, and 2008. In total he served 11 years as a legislator, and was selected as Taiwan's \"Best Legislator\" four times in a row by Taipei-based NGO Citizen Congress Watch.[13]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Tainan (2010–2017)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2010 Taiwanese local elections and 2014 Taiwanese local elections\n\n![](image)Lai as Mayor of Tainan, 2017.\nWith the 2010 reorganization of the municipalities in Taiwan, Tainan City and Tainan County were amalgamated into a single municipality, called Tainan. After successfully being selected in the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) primaries in January 2010,[14] Lai stood as the DPP candidate for the mayoral election on 27 November 2010, gaining 60.41% to defeat Kuomintang candidate Kuo Tien-tsai.[15][16] He took office on 25 December 2010.\n\n\nAs a result of his strong showing in the mayoral election coupled with his relative youth and his control of the DPP heartland city of Tainan, Lai was considered to be a potential candidate for a presidential run in 2016.[17] In 2013 an opinion poll ranked Lai as the most popular of the 22 city and county heads in Taiwan, with an approval rating of 87%.[18]\n\n\nLai made on 5 June 2014 a visit to the city of Shanghai to assist an exhibition of art by the late Taiwanese painter Tan Ting-pho and met politicians of the Chinese Communist Party.[19][20]\n\n\nLai stood for reelection on 29 November 2014 against Huang Hsiu-shuang of the Kuomintang. His opponent was considered to have such an uphill task in the DPP stronghold that she rode a black horse through the streets of Tainan as an election stunt; a hopeful allusion to her status as a \"dark horse\".[21] Lai, on the other hand, did not plan many campaign activities, choosing to focus on mayoral duties.[22] He eventually won the election by 45 percentage points,[23][24] the largest margin of victory in any of the municipal races in the election.[25]\n\n\nLai stepped down as Mayor in September 2017, after being appointed to the Premiership.[26] He was succeeded in acting capacity by Lee Meng-yen.[27]\n\n\n\n## Premier (2017–2019)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lai cabinet\n\n![](image)Premier Lai Ching-te led the cabinet during the swearing-in ceremony\n![](image)William Lai (center) with Ethan Tu (left) and Huang Wei-cher (right), in January 2019.\nIn September 2017, Premier Lin Chuan tendered his resignation to President Tsai Ing-wen, which was reluctantly accepted. A recent poll showed Lin's approve rating to be a mere 28.7%, with 6 in 10 respondents dissatisfied with the performance of his cabinet.[28] On 5 September, President Tsai announced at a press conference that Lai would become the country's next head of the Executive Yuan.[29]\n\n\nLai took office on 8 September as the 49th Premier of the Republic of China.[30] Following Lai's appointment as premier, Tsai's approval ratings reached 46%, rebounding by more than 16 points since August.[31] Lai made his first appearance as premier at the Legislative Yuan on 26 September, where he stated \"I am a political worker who advocates Taiwan independence\" but that \"We are already an independent sovereign nation called the Republic of China. We don't need a separate declaration of independence\".[32][33] Lai has appeared to have moderated his position on Taiwanese independence particularly when he proposed the idea of \"being close to China while loving Taiwan\" in June 2017.[34] He also expressed no desire to run against Tsai Ing-wen in the 2020 presidential election.[35] On 28 September, the New Party called on the KMT to join it in filing a formal complaint against the Premier for sedition.[36]\n\n\nIn October 2017, it was reported that Lai had garnered the approval of 68.8 percent of respondents in a survey, while 23 percent expressed dissatisfaction.[37] However, critics say that his popularity may not last, due to his rapid reversal of his position on the issue of Taiwanese independence.[38] However, on 20 October, Lai in response to General Secretary Xi Jinping's comments on the one China policy and the 1992 consensus at the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Lai said that the Taiwanese government, following the directives of Tsai Ing-wen, would fulfill its promise of not changing the status quo between the two neighbors and not ceding before pressure from Beijing, which comes in the form of military intimidation and an international blockade.[39]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Lai tendered his resignation to the president, after the ruling DPP was trounced in local elections.[40] Lai agreed to remain in office to help stabilize the government until the general budget was cleared by the Legislative Yuan in January 2019.[41][42] Lai's cabinet resigned on 11 January 2019 and Su Tseng-chang was appointed as new premier.[43][44]\n\n\n\n## First presidential campaign (2019)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2019 Democratic Progressive Party presidential primary and 2020 Taiwanese presidential election\n\nOn 18 March 2019, Lai Ching-te registered to run in the Democratic Progressive Party presidential primary, saying that he could shoulder the responsibility of leading Taiwan in defending itself from being annexed by China.[45] This is the first time in Taiwanese history where a serious primary challenge has been mounted against a sitting president.[46] The results of the DPP's primary poll released on 13 June shown that Tsai defeated Lai by winning 35.67 percent of the vote over Lai's 27.48 percent, officially becoming the DPP's presidential candidate for the 2020 election.[47]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Lai accepted president Tsai Ing-wen's offer to become her running mate for the 2020 presidential election.[48] Tsai secured over 57% of the ballot, winning a record 8.17 million votes in the election and began her second term in 2020.[49][50]\n\n\n\n## Vice presidency and second presidential campaign (2020–2024)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lai exchanging gifts with Palaun President Surangel Whipps Jr. (left) on an official visit to Palau in November 2022\nDuring his vice presidency, Lai served as president Tsai Ing-wen's special envoy to Honduras for president Xiomara Castro's inauguration in January 2022.[51] After the assassination of former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, he made a private trip to Tokyo to pay his respects and became Taiwan's most senior official to visit Japan in five decades.[52] In November 2022, Lai led representatives of Taiwan's travel agencies and industry associations to Palau to foster collaborations between the two countries.[53]\n\n\nIn November 2022, president Tsai Ing-wen resigned as leader of DPP after the party's heavy losses in local elections.[54] Lai officially registered as a candidate for the DPP chair election in December.[55] Since Lai was the only candidate running, he became the new chairman of the DPP in 2023.[56][57] In March 2023, Lai registered as the only person to run in the DPP's 2024 presidential primary and was officially nominated by the ruling party in April.[58][59]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** Taiwan\n2. **^** \"Lai bids farewell to Tainan, names Lee Meng-yen as acting mayor\". *Focus Taiwan*. 6 September 2017.

He has been the incumbent mayor of New Taipei since 25 December 2018.[2] Previously, he served as Director-General of the National Police Agency from 2006 to 2008 and as acting mayor of New Taipei City from October 2015 to January 2016. He is Kuomintang's official candidate for the 2024 Taiwanese presidential elections. He firstly joined the party during the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek.\n\n\n\n\n## Law enforcement career[edit]\n\n\nUpon his graduation from the Central Police University, Hou was sent to the Taipei City Police Department. Hou obtained his first leadership role, as captain of the Taipei criminal police, in 1980.[3] In 1992, he became an inspector at the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB), a division of the National Police Agency (NPA). Five years later, he led the rescue of the Alexander family.[4] In 1998 Hou was named second in command of the CIB. He was given the concurrent post of Taoyuan County police chief in 2001 and promoted within the NPA in 2003, becoming the leader of the CIB.[5] The next year, Hou was tasked with investigating the 3-19 shooting incident,[6] an assassination attempt on President Chen Shui-bian, a longtime friend.[7] He was named the director-general of the NPA in 2006, becoming the youngest leader of the police force at the time of his appointment.[8] During his tenure, the NPA was criticized for its inadequate response to the 2006 protests led by Shih Ming-teh.[9][10] Multiple Kuomintang politicians also wanted Hou to reopen the investigation on the 3-19 shooting incident. Arms dealer Tang Shou-yi, who had fled to Mainland China by August 2006, had recanted his confession, stating that it was coerced and therefore untrue.[11] Hou was named the president of Central Police University in 2008[12] and was replaced at the NPA by Wang Cho-chiun [zh].[13]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nHou originally joined the Kuomintang in 1975, but allowed his membership to lapse during his law enforcement career.[14][15] Hou was recruited to join the Democratic Progressive Party in 2002.[16] Eric Chu asked Hou to serve as deputy mayor of New Taipei in 2010,[17] and Hou rejoined the Kuomintang in 2013.[15] Hou served as deputy mayor alongside Lee Shu-chuan and Hsu Chih-chien who left office on 25 February 2014 and 30 June 2014, respectively.[18][19][20] Later, Chen Shen-hsien was appointed to the deputy mayorship.[21] Hou was promoted from his previous position as deputy mayor on 20 October 2015, as Chu prepared for the 2016 presidential election.[22] Chu lost the election to Tsai Ing-wen, and resumed mayoral duties on 18 January 2016.[23]\n\n\nHou resigned from the deputy mayorship on 28 February 2018, stating that he would contest the Kuomintang mayoral primary.[24][25] On 6 April 2018, the KMT announced that Hou had won the primary.[26][27]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2018 Kuomintang New Taipei City mayoral primary results[28] |\n| --- |\n| Candidates\n | Place\n | Results\n |\n| **Hou Yu-ih** | **Nominated** | **55.596%** |\n| Chou Hsi-wei | 2nd\n | 34.210%\n |\n| Ching Chieh-shou\n | 3rd\n | 10.194%\n |\n\n\n### 2018 New Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2018 New Taipei mayoralty election result\n\n\n| 2018 New Taipei City mayoral results[29][30] |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Su Tseng-chang | Template:DPP | 873,692\n | 42.85%\n |  |\n| 2 | **Hou Yu-ih** | ![](image) Kuomintang | 1,165,130\n | 57.15%\n | ![](image) |\n| **Total voters** | 　3,264,128\n |\n| **Valid votes** | 　2,038,822\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | 　50,305\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | 　62.46%\n |\n\n\n### 2022 New Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, 2022, Hou confirmed that he would run for a second term as mayor of New Taipei.[31]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2022 New Taipei City mayoral results\n |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Lin Chia-lung | Template:DPP | 693,976\n | 37.58%\n |  |\n| 2 | **Hou Yu-ih** | ![](image) Kuomintang | 1,152,555\n | 62.42%\n | ![](image) |\n| **Total voters** | 　3,316,517\n |\n| **Valid votes** | 　1,877,186\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | 　30,655\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | 　56.60%\n |\n\n\n### 2024 presidential elections[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the 2024 presidential election, Hou was considered the favorite for the Kuomintang presidential primary.[32] He was drafted by the Kuomintang on 17 May 2023 to be its nominee for the presidency.[33][34]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2023, KMT and Taiwan People's Party leadership announced that they would field a single joint presidential ticket made up of Hou and TPP chairman Ko Wen-je. The order was to be determined by opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November,[35] but the parties were unable to reach an agreement on that date, leaving the possibility of a joint ticket in doubt.[36]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHou was born on 7 June 1957, in Puzi, Chiayi County, where his family owned a pork stall. As a child Hou aided the family business by catching and butchering wild pigs.[3]\n\n\nHou's firstborn son Hou Ni-wei died on 15 May 1992, in a tour bus fire,[37][38][39] which killed 23 people.[40] He and his wife Jen Mei-ling raised three daughters, Hou Yu-fan, Hou Ni-chia, and Hou Yu-chia.[41][42]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Out of office as Mayor of New Taipei since 24 September 2023 for being the Kuomintang candidate in the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election\n2. **^** \"市長 侯友宜\". *New Taipei City Government* (in Chinese).

Arms dealer Tang Shou-yi, who had fled to Mainland China by August 2006, had recanted his confession, stating that it was coerced and therefore untrue.[11] Hou was named the president of Central Police University in 2008[12] and was replaced at the NPA by Wang Cho-chiun [zh].[13]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nHou originally joined the Kuomintang in 1975, but allowed his membership to lapse during his law enforcement career.[14][15] Hou was recruited to join the Democratic Progressive Party in 2002.[16] Eric Chu asked Hou to serve as deputy mayor of New Taipei in 2010,[17] and Hou rejoined the Kuomintang in 2013.[15] Hou served as deputy mayor alongside Lee Shu-chuan and Hsu Chih-chien who left office on 25 February 2014 and 30 June 2014, respectively.[18][19][20] Later, Chen Shen-hsien was appointed to the deputy mayorship.[21] Hou was promoted from his previous position as deputy mayor on 20 October 2015, as Chu prepared for the 2016 presidential election.[22] Chu lost the election to Tsai Ing-wen, and resumed mayoral duties on 18 January 2016.[23]\n\n\nHou resigned from the deputy mayorship on 28 February 2018, stating that he would contest the Kuomintang mayoral primary.[24][25] On 6 April 2018, the KMT announced that Hou had won the primary.[26][27]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2018 Kuomintang New Taipei City mayoral primary results[28] |\n| --- |\n| Candidates\n | Place\n | Results\n |\n| **Hou Yu-ih** | **Nominated** | **55.596%** |\n| Chou Hsi-wei | 2nd\n | 34.210%\n |\n| Ching Chieh-shou\n | 3rd\n | 10.194%\n |\n\n\n### 2018 New Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2018 New Taipei mayoralty election result\n\n\n| 2018 New Taipei City mayoral results[29][30] |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Su Tseng-chang | Template:DPP | 873,692\n | 42.85%\n |  |\n| 2 | **Hou Yu-ih** | ![](image) Kuomintang | 1,165,130\n | 57.15%\n | ![](image) |\n| **Total voters** | 　3,264,128\n |\n| **Valid votes** | 　2,038,822\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | 　50,305\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | 　62.46%\n |\n\n\n### 2022 New Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, 2022, Hou confirmed that he would run for a second term as mayor of New Taipei.[31]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2022 New Taipei City mayoral results\n |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Lin Chia-lung | Template:DPP | 693,976\n | 37.58%\n |  |\n| 2 | **Hou Yu-ih** | ![](image) Kuomintang | 1,152,555\n | 62.42%\n | ![](image) |\n| **Total voters** | 　3,316,517\n |\n| **Valid votes** | 　1,877,186\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | 　30,655\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | 　56.60%\n |\n\n\n### 2024 presidential elections[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the 2024 presidential election, Hou was considered the favorite for the Kuomintang presidential primary.[32] He was drafted by the Kuomintang on 17 May 2023 to be its nominee for the presidency.[33][34]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2023, KMT and Taiwan People's Party leadership announced that they would field a single joint presidential ticket made up of Hou and TPP chairman Ko Wen-je. The order was to be determined by opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November,[35] but the parties were unable to reach an agreement on that date, leaving the possibility of a joint ticket in doubt.[36]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHou was born on 7 June 1957, in Puzi, Chiayi County, where his family owned a pork stall. As a child Hou aided the family business by catching and butchering wild pigs.[3]\n\n\nHou's firstborn son Hou Ni-wei died on 15 May 1992, in a tour bus fire,[37][38][39] which killed 23 people.[40] He and his wife Jen Mei-ling raised three daughters, Hou Yu-fan, Hou Ni-chia, and Hou Yu-chia.[41][42]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Out of office as Mayor of New Taipei since 24 September 2023 for being the Kuomintang candidate in the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election\n2. **^** \"市長 侯友宜\". *New Taipei City Government* (in Chinese).

He has been the chairman of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) since 2019.[1]\n\n\nBefore becoming mayor, he was a doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital. He was also a professor at National Taiwan University College of Medicine, and specialized in fields including trauma, intensive care, organ transplant, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and artificial organs.[2] Due to his profession, he has been nicknamed Ko P or KP (which stands for Professor Ko, and is how he is customarily referred to within National Taiwan University). Ko was responsible for standardising organ transplant procedures in Taiwan, and was the first physician to bring ECMO to Taiwan. Apart from his practice, Ko is known for his numerous media appearances and interviews as a social and political commentator.\n\n\nIn the 2014 Taipei Mayoral Election, Ko ran as an independent candidate. He beat Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Pasuya Yao in the unofficial primary,[3] gaining support from the DPP and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU). Ko won the election with 853,983 votes, becoming the first physician mayor of the city since the introduction of direct election to the office.\n\n\nOn 20 May 2023, Ko became the official nominee of the TPP for the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election.[4] He is seen as the “third way” between DPP and Kuomintang (KMT), the two parties that have traditionally dominated Taiwan's political landscape.[5] Having been consistently placed at 2nd behind DPP's Lai Ching-te in polls, he is a serious contender for the election, despite mostly receiving inadequate attention in Western discourses.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nKo Wen-je grew up in a modest household. His father, Ko Cheng-fa, had aspirations for Ko, as the eldest son, to become a medical doctor. His mother is Ho Jui-ying. After graduating from National Hsinchu Senior High School, Ko studied medicine for a year at National Yang-Ming University, before being accepted into the Medical School at NTU after resitting his university entrance exams.[6][7][8]\n\n\nBetween August 1986 and September 1988, Ko served in the 269th mechanized infantry division of the Republic of China Army to fulfill his military service obligation. He was a combat medic with the rank of second lieutenant.\n\n\n\n## Medical career[edit]\n\n\nOn graduation, Ko placed first nationwide on the medical license exams and received his medical license. On the advice of his professor, Dr. Chu Shu-hsun, Ko decided to specialize in surgery and critical care within the department of Emergency Medicine, working on the front lines of the emergency room. After working in emergency services for 11 years, Ko traveled to the United States in 1993 for a one-year clinical fellowship program on artificial liver research at the University of Minnesota under Wei-Shou Hu.\n\n\nAfter returning to Taiwan in 1994, Ko continued to work in the emergency room while at the same time beginning his Ph.D. studies at NTU. With an invitation from Dr. Chu Shu-hsun, Ko helped found NTU's first organ transplant team, with the goal of performing heart transplants. Hoping to increase the transplant success rate, Ko introduced ECMO treatment from the US, and improved the transplant success rate from 19% to 51%. On 30 January 2008, Ko set a world record of 117 consecutive days for keeping a patient alive using ECMO.[9] Using US treatment standards as a guide, Ko established a set of standards for organ transplant procedures in Taiwan that was later promulgated throughout Taiwan by the then Department of Health.\n\n\nIn 2002, Ko received his PhD degree in clinical medicine from NTU. Aside from his work improving medical technology in Taiwan, Ko has since the year 2000 participated in many foreign medical conferences in the People's Republic of China (PRC), where he was also responsible for introducing ECMO treatment to the nation.\n\n\nOn 15 July 2006, Ko wrote an article for the *Min Sheng Daily* titled \"Reflections, Errors, and Apologies: Chao Chien-ming\" that received considerable media attention and led to a number of politics-related interviews. On 18 November, Ko used ECMO to save the life of Shirley Shaw, wife of Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, who had fallen into a coma after a car accident.[10][11] This incident in particular and the media attention it drew caused Ko Wen-je to become a household name.\n\n\nIn 2010, Ko introduced the American concept of integrated care to Taiwan, and established the Integrated Care Unit at NTU Hospital with the aim of reducing treatment cost and improving quality of treatment and quality of life for the attendant doctors and nurses. Ko directed the emergency care team that treated Sean Lien (Lien Sheng-wun) for critical wounds after he was shot in the face at close range with a 9mm pistol on 26 November. Lien recovered quickly, which led the media to speculate about the veracity of his story, but Ko quickly came forward to verify his claims.[12]\n\n\nOn 24 August 2011, Ko was held responsible for an organ transplant error and subsequently reprimanded by National Taiwan University Hospital and the Ministry of Health of Taiwan. He was the acting director for a standard organ transplant procedure in which 5 patients received transplants from a coma patient who was HIV-positive. In 2012, the Control Yuan accused Ko of misconduct for violating organ transplant procedures.\n\n\nIn May 2013, the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice suspected Ko of involvement in the misappropriation of National Science Council funds by creating fraudulent receipts, and asked Ko for an itemized list of payment details. Ko was thus drawn into the Accounting Act Amendment scandal, but the Control Yuan never brought charges. In June that year, Ko's emergency trauma care student Dr. Tseng Yue-tsee was hit by a drunk driver and sustained major trauma. She was brought to the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital.[13] Ko went to the hospital as soon as he was notified and oversaw her treatment, but she died. As a result of this incident, Ko started a foundation for the prevention of drunk driving. In August, Ko was invited by Control Yuan member Huang Huang-hsiung to attend a conference in Beijing and to visit Yan'an, Shaanxi Province. Ko became more focused on politics and announced his candidacy for Taipei City Mayor on 6 January 2014.\n\n\n\n## 2014 Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\nOn the evening of 6 January 2014, Ko announced his candidacy for Taipei City Mayor. On 16 January, he set up his campaign office and began bringing in campaign staff and volunteers.[14][15][16] During a symposium in Kaohsiung, Ko revealed that the accusations of misconduct in the AIDS transplant incident were the main cause of his decision to run for Mayor.[17] After announcing his candidacy, Ko was hesitant about whether or not he should join the DPP and run as the DPP candidate.[18][19][20][21][22][23] He ultimately decided to run as an independent, but to retain coordination with the DPP.\n\n\nDuring the DPP primaries, Ko refused to debate DPP candidates Annette Lu and Wellington Koo on numerous occasions.[24][25][26][27] A number of \"slips of the tongue\" made it into the news, for example when Ko said that the \"Lawyer Culture\" of Taiwan should end, when he criticised Koo Lee-hsiung's Facebook posts grieving over the death of Trong Chai as \"too emotional\", and when he possibly unintentionally revealed confidential patient information.[28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38]\n\n\nAfter Pasuya Yao made it through the first round of DPP primaries, Ko agreed to a debate on 12 June, and subsequently won the DPP polls.[39][40] On 16 June, the DPP agreed not to put forward a candidate for the election, and to support Ko as the representative of the Pan-Green Coalition, without forcing Ko to join any political party.\n\n\nOn 10 November, Ko announced his intention to reject further monetary donations to his campaign, as the amount received by 31 October exceeded the NT$87 million cap set for Taipei mayoral elections.[41]\n\n\nKo's campaign was managed by Yao Li-ming (general manager), Lee Ying-yuan (political platform), Chi Cheng (civic organisations), and Chiou Yue-yee (\"We Care\" youth organisation). Ko's advisers included political scientist and politician Julian Kuo, political activist and filmmaker Yang Huei-ju, and former DPP secretary Chang Yee-shan. DPP city councillor Chien Yue-yen, neurologist Pan Cheng-chih, and two recruits from youth outreach efforts were the acting spokespeople for the campaign.[42]\n\n\n\n### Organ harvesting controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2014, reports surfaced that, according to Ethan Gutmann, an investigative writer who testified before the U.S. Congress on forced organ harvesting, Ko reportedly visited China in 2004 and tried to negotiate good prices for organs illegally harvested from newly executed Falun Gong practitioners.[43] Ko denied the accusation, and said he told Gutmann that there were some doctors in Taiwan who had been involved in buying or selling organs for transplant, but that he was not one of them. He added that he did not know whether the organs came from Falun Gong practitioners or not, and that he only stated in the interview with Gutmann that the majority of organ sources in mainland China were unclear.[44] Ko's office alleged that a recording of a conversation between Gutmann and Ko drastically contradicted details provided by Gutmann, however, they never produced the recording they claimed to possess. Ko also engaged an attorney to request Gutmann to correct alleged false allegations in his book. Gutmann responded saying he had not said that Ko was involved in the organ trade, and that he might have been intentionally misinterpreted.[45][46]\n\n\nOn 27 November, Gutmann released a legal response with lawyer Clive Ansley, stating that \"no English speaking reviewer of the book has understood page 255 in the way it has apparently been understood in Taiwan by readers whose first language is Chinese\", meaning that he had never accused Ko of being an organ broker. Instead, readers have praised Ko for his significant contribution to \"the international effort to expose the medical crimes which continue to be perpetrated in China.\" In addition, Gutmann and Ansley stated that \"the book was peer-reviewed by three expert readers and subjected to a lengthy internal editing process by Prometheus. This review included not only the text itself, but also the author's notes, interview tapes, and electronic communications.\"[47] In the endnotes of *The Slaughter*, Gutmann says he gave Ko an advance draft of the section, and that Ko signed off on it, and only a few minor edits were made afterwards.[48] A full explanation, including the actual email correspondence where Ko signed off on the story for publication, was provided by Gutmann in December.[49][50][51]\n\n\n\n### Election result[edit]\n\n\nAfter the Taipei mayoral election on 29 November 2014, Ko emerged the winner.[52] He appointed Teng Chia-chi,[53] Charles Lin [zh],[54] and Chou Li-fang[55] deputy mayors. Chou resigned her post in January 2016 and was replaced by Chen Chin-jun.[56][57]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2014 Taipei mayoral election result\n |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Chen Ju-pin [zh] | Self Help Party | 1,624\n | 0.11%\n |  |\n| 2 | Chao Yen-ching [zh] | Independent | 15,898\n | 1.06%\n |  |\n| 3 | Lee Hung-hsin (李宏信) | Independent | 2,621\n | 0.18%\n |  |\n| 4 | Chen Yung-chang [zh] | Independent | 1,908\n | 0.13%\n |  |\n| 5 | Neil Peng | Independent | 8,080\n | 0.54%\n |  |\n| 6 | Sean Lien | ![](image) Kuomintang | 609,932\n | 40.82%\n |  |\n| 7 | **Ko Wen-je** | Independent | 853,983\n | 57.16%\n | ![](image)\n |\n\n\n## 2018 Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\nKo Wen-je was narrowly reelected mayor of Taipei in 2018 Taiwanese local elections.\n\n\n\n### Election result[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2018 Taipei mayoral election result[58] |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Wu Er-yang [zh] | ![](image) Independent | 5,617\n | 0.40%\n |  |\n| 2 | Ting Shou-chung [zh] | ![](image) Kuomintang | 577,566\n | 40.82%\n |  |\n| 3 | Pasuya Yao | Template:DPP | 244,641\n | 17.29%\n |  |\n| 4 | **Ko Wen-je** | ![](image) Independent | 580,820\n | 41.05%\n | ![](image)\n |\n| 5 | Lee Si-kuen [zh] | ![](image) Independent | 6,172\n | 0.44%\n |  |\n| **Total voters** | 　2,164,155\n |\n| **Valid votes** | 　1,413,870\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | 　13,355\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | 　65.95%\n |\n\n\nIn March 2019, Ko named Tsai Ping-kun a deputy mayor of Taipei.[59]\n\n\n\n## 2024 presidential elections[edit]\n\n\nHe is a candidate for the 2024 Taiwanese presidential elections, for the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), being the only individual to register in the party's presidential primary.[60][61]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2023, TPP and KMT leadership announced a plan to field a single joint presidential ticket consisting of Ko and KMT candidate Hou Yu-ih, with the order to be determined by opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November.[62] However, Ko was unable to come to an agreement with the KMT leadership, and on 19 November he publicly affirmed that he still intended to run as the presidential candidate of the TPP.[63]\n\n\n\n## Political stances[edit]\n\n\nKo provided support from the medical community when Chen Shui-bian was elected as Taipei City Mayor in 1994,[64] as well as during his 2000 Presidential bid, when he ultimately took two weeks off work to support Chen's fundraising efforts.[65] Ko is also a long-time member of the “Friends of A-bian Club”. As President, Chen opened the Ketagalan Institute in 2003, but the school was suspended for 3 years starting in 2008 after Chen stepped down and corruption charges were brought against the former president. In November 2012, the school resumed enrollment and Ko enrolled in a month-long course as a student under the guidance of Legislator Gao Jyh-peng, a long-time friend of Chen's.[66][67][68]\n\n\nOn 20 June 2012, Ko organised a small treatment team for Chen Shui-bian, whose condition had worsened since his imprisonment, and issued a public statement signed by many prominent individuals in the medical community to demand Chen be released for medical treatment.[69] Ko has made numerous statements expressing his view that Chen should be released for treatment, and has also expressed his view that Chen's prosecution was purely political.[70][71][72][73][74][75]\n\n\nKo supported Tsai Ing-wen in her Presidential bid in 2012 and helped fundraising efforts for her campaign. He is also a permanent member of the pro-Tsai “Friends of Ing Club”.[76] Nevertheless, he has criticized Tsai's proposal for a Taiwan Consensus over lack of clarity.[77]\n\n\nKo has mentioned that his strategic goals are the same as those of the DPP.[78] He has expressed his dislike for the KMT on numerous occasions.[79] However, in September 2016, he reiterated that he would not join the DPP, and would remain independent until his mayoral term ended.[80]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKo's wife, Chen Pei-chi, was born in Penghu, Taiwan.[81] She graduated from Makung Senior High School and National Taiwan University's Department of Medicine. She is the director of Pediatrics for Taipei City Hospital, Heping Fuyou Women and Children's Health Branch. Ko and Chen had an arranged marriage, and have three children, one boy and two girls.[82] It is known throughout Taiwan that as a mayor Ko earns less than his wife. He once joked that in order to pay off their home mortgage, his wife still could not retire early.[83] Ko has claimed to have Asperger syndrome,[84][85] but, as of 2014, had not been diagnosed.[86] His son also has the condition.[87]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Independent Is Elected Taipei Mayor as Taiwan's Governing Party Falters\n2. **^** \"Biography at NTUH\".

He has been the chairman of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) since 2019.[1]\n\n\nBefore becoming mayor, he was a doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital. He was also a professor at National Taiwan University College of Medicine, and specialized in fields including trauma, intensive care, organ transplant, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and artificial organs.[2] Due to his profession, he has been nicknamed Ko P or KP (which stands for Professor Ko, and is how he is customarily referred to within National Taiwan University). Ko was responsible for standardising organ transplant procedures in Taiwan, and was the first physician to bring ECMO to Taiwan. Apart from his practice, Ko is known for his numerous media appearances and interviews as a social and political commentator.\n\n\nIn the 2014 Taipei Mayoral Election, Ko ran as an independent candidate. He beat Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Pasuya Yao in the unofficial primary,[3] gaining support from the DPP and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU). Ko won the election with 853,983 votes, becoming the first physician mayor of the city since the introduction of direct election to the office.\n\n\nOn 20 May 2023, Ko became the official nominee of the TPP for the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election.[4] He is seen as the “third way” between DPP and Kuomintang (KMT), the two parties that have traditionally dominated Taiwan's political landscape.[5] Having been consistently placed at 2nd behind DPP's Lai Ching-te in polls, he is a serious contender for the election, despite mostly receiving inadequate attention in Western discourses.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nKo Wen-je grew up in a modest household. His father, Ko Cheng-fa, had aspirations for Ko, as the eldest son, to become a medical doctor. His mother is Ho Jui-ying. After graduating from National Hsinchu Senior High School, Ko studied medicine for a year at National Yang-Ming University, before being accepted into the Medical School at NTU after resitting his university entrance exams.[6][7][8]\n\n\nBetween August 1986 and September 1988, Ko served in the 269th mechanized infantry division of the Republic of China Army to fulfill his military service obligation. He was a combat medic with the rank of second lieutenant.\n\n\n\n## Medical career[edit]\n\n\nOn graduation, Ko placed first nationwide on the medical license exams and received his medical license. On the advice of his professor, Dr. Chu Shu-hsun, Ko decided to specialize in surgery and critical care within the department of Emergency Medicine, working on the front lines of the emergency room. After working in emergency services for 11 years, Ko traveled to the United States in 1993 for a one-year clinical fellowship program on artificial liver research at the University of Minnesota under Wei-Shou Hu.\n\n\nAfter returning to Taiwan in 1994, Ko continued to work in the emergency room while at the same time beginning his Ph.D. studies at NTU. With an invitation from Dr. Chu Shu-hsun, Ko helped found NTU's first organ transplant team, with the goal of performing heart transplants. Hoping to increase the transplant success rate, Ko introduced ECMO treatment from the US, and improved the transplant success rate from 19% to 51%. On 30 January 2008, Ko set a world record of 117 consecutive days for keeping a patient alive using ECMO.[9] Using US treatment standards as a guide, Ko established a set of standards for organ transplant procedures in Taiwan that was later promulgated throughout Taiwan by the then Department of Health.\n\n\nIn 2002, Ko received his PhD degree in clinical medicine from NTU. Aside from his work improving medical technology in Taiwan, Ko has since the year 2000 participated in many foreign medical conferences in the People's Republic of China (PRC), where he was also responsible for introducing ECMO treatment to the nation.\n\n\nOn 15 July 2006, Ko wrote an article for the *Min Sheng Daily* titled \"Reflections, Errors, and Apologies: Chao Chien-ming\" that received considerable media attention and led to a number of politics-related interviews. On 18 November, Ko used ECMO to save the life of Shirley Shaw, wife of Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, who had fallen into a coma after a car accident.[10][11] This incident in particular and the media attention it drew caused Ko Wen-je to become a household name.\n\n\nIn 2010, Ko introduced the American concept of integrated care to Taiwan, and established the Integrated Care Unit at NTU Hospital with the aim of reducing treatment cost and improving quality of treatment and quality of life for the attendant doctors and nurses. Ko directed the emergency care team that treated Sean Lien (Lien Sheng-wun) for critical wounds after he was shot in the face at close range with a 9mm pistol on 26 November. Lien recovered quickly, which led the media to speculate about the veracity of his story, but Ko quickly came forward to verify his claims.[12]\n\n\nOn 24 August 2011, Ko was held responsible for an organ transplant error and subsequently reprimanded by National Taiwan University Hospital and the Ministry of Health of Taiwan. He was the acting director for a standard organ transplant procedure in which 5 patients received transplants from a coma patient who was HIV-positive. In 2012, the Control Yuan accused Ko of misconduct for violating organ transplant procedures.\n\n\nIn May 2013, the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice suspected Ko of involvement in the misappropriation of National Science Council funds by creating fraudulent receipts, and asked Ko for an itemized list of payment details. Ko was thus drawn into the Accounting Act Amendment scandal, but the Control Yuan never brought charges. In June that year, Ko's emergency trauma care student Dr. Tseng Yue-tsee was hit by a drunk driver and sustained major trauma. She was brought to the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital.[13] Ko went to the hospital as soon as he was notified and oversaw her treatment, but she died. As a result of this incident, Ko started a foundation for the prevention of drunk driving. In August, Ko was invited by Control Yuan member Huang Huang-hsiung to attend a conference in Beijing and to visit Yan'an, Shaanxi Province. Ko became more focused on politics and announced his candidacy for Taipei City Mayor on 6 January 2014.\n\n\n\n## 2014 Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\nOn the evening of 6 January 2014, Ko announced his candidacy for Taipei City Mayor. On 16 January, he set up his campaign office and began bringing in campaign staff and volunteers.[14][15][16] During a symposium in Kaohsiung, Ko revealed that the accusations of misconduct in the AIDS transplant incident were the main cause of his decision to run for Mayor.[17] After announcing his candidacy, Ko was hesitant about whether or not he should join the DPP and run as the DPP candidate.[18][19][20][21][22][23] He ultimately decided to run as an independent, but to retain coordination with the DPP.\n\n\nDuring the DPP primaries, Ko refused to debate DPP candidates Annette Lu and Wellington Koo on numerous occasions.[24][25][26][27] A number of \"slips of the tongue\" made it into the news, for example when Ko said that the \"Lawyer Culture\" of Taiwan should end, when he criticised Koo Lee-hsiung's Facebook posts grieving over the death of Trong Chai as \"too emotional\", and when he possibly unintentionally revealed confidential patient information.[28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38]\n\n\nAfter Pasuya Yao made it through the first round of DPP primaries, Ko agreed to a debate on 12 June, and subsequently won the DPP polls.[39][40] On 16 June, the DPP agreed not to put forward a candidate for the election, and to support Ko as the representative of the Pan-Green Coalition, without forcing Ko to join any political party.\n\n\nOn 10 November, Ko announced his intention to reject further monetary donations to his campaign, as the amount received by 31 October exceeded the NT$87 million cap set for Taipei mayoral elections.[41]\n\n\nKo's campaign was managed by Yao Li-ming (general manager), Lee Ying-yuan (political platform), Chi Cheng (civic organisations), and Chiou Yue-yee (\"We Care\" youth organisation). Ko's advisers included political scientist and politician Julian Kuo, political activist and filmmaker Yang Huei-ju, and former DPP secretary Chang Yee-shan. DPP city councillor Chien Yue-yen, neurologist Pan Cheng-chih, and two recruits from youth outreach efforts were the acting spokespeople for the campaign.[42]\n\n\n\n### Organ harvesting controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2014, reports surfaced that, according to Ethan Gutmann, an investigative writer who testified before the U.S. Congress on forced organ harvesting, Ko reportedly visited China in 2004 and tried to negotiate good prices for organs illegally harvested from newly executed Falun Gong practitioners.[43] Ko denied the accusation, and said he told Gutmann that there were some doctors in Taiwan who had been involved in buying or selling organs for transplant, but that he was not one of them. He added that he did not know whether the organs came from Falun Gong practitioners or not, and that he only stated in the interview with Gutmann that the majority of organ sources in mainland China were unclear.[44] Ko's office alleged that a recording of a conversation between Gutmann and Ko drastically contradicted details provided by Gutmann, however, they never produced the recording they claimed to possess. Ko also engaged an attorney to request Gutmann to correct alleged false allegations in his book. Gutmann responded saying he had not said that Ko was involved in the organ trade, and that he might have been intentionally misinterpreted.[45][46]\n\n\nOn 27 November, Gutmann released a legal response with lawyer Clive Ansley, stating that \"no English speaking reviewer of the book has understood page 255 in the way it has apparently been understood in Taiwan by readers whose first language is Chinese\", meaning that he had never accused Ko of being an organ broker. Instead, readers have praised Ko for his significant contribution to \"the international effort to expose the medical crimes which continue to be perpetrated in China.\" In addition, Gutmann and Ansley stated that \"the book was peer-reviewed by three expert readers and subjected to a lengthy internal editing process by Prometheus. This review included not only the text itself, but also the author's notes, interview tapes, and electronic communications.\"[47] In the endnotes of *The Slaughter*, Gutmann says he gave Ko an advance draft of the section, and that Ko signed off on it, and only a few minor edits were made afterwards.[48] A full explanation, including the actual email correspondence where Ko signed off on the story for publication, was provided by Gutmann in December.[49][50][51]\n\n\n\n### Election result[edit]\n\n\nAfter the Taipei mayoral election on 29 November 2014, Ko emerged the winner.[52] He appointed Teng Chia-chi,[53] Charles Lin [zh],[54] and Chou Li-fang[55] deputy mayors. Chou resigned her post in January 2016 and was replaced by Chen Chin-jun.[56][57]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2014 Taipei mayoral election result\n |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Chen Ju-pin [zh] | Self Help Party | 1,624\n | 0.11%\n |  |\n| 2 | Chao Yen-ching [zh] | Independent | 15,898\n | 1.06%\n |  |\n| 3 | Lee Hung-hsin (李宏信) | Independent | 2,621\n | 0.18%\n |  |\n| 4 | Chen Yung-chang [zh] | Independent | 1,908\n | 0.13%\n |  |\n| 5 | Neil Peng | Independent | 8,080\n | 0.54%\n |  |\n| 6 | Sean Lien | ![](image) Kuomintang | 609,932\n | 40.82%\n |  |\n| 7 | **Ko Wen-je** | Independent | 853,983\n | 57.16%\n | ![](image)\n |\n\n\n## 2018 Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\nKo Wen-je was narrowly reelected mayor of Taipei in 2018 Taiwanese local elections.\n\n\n\n### Election result[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2018 Taipei mayoral election result[58] |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Wu Er-yang [zh] | ![](image) Independent | 5,617\n | 0.40%\n |  |\n| 2 | Ting Shou-chung [zh] | ![](image) Kuomintang | 577,566\n | 40.82%\n |  |\n| 3 | Pasuya Yao | Template:DPP | 244,641\n | 17.29%\n |  |\n| 4 | **Ko Wen-je** | ![](image) Independent | 580,820\n | 41.05%\n | ![](image)\n |\n| 5 | Lee Si-kuen [zh] | ![](image) Independent | 6,172\n | 0.44%\n |  |\n| **Total voters** | 　2,164,155\n |\n| **Valid votes** | 　1,413,870\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | 　13,355\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | 　65.95%\n |\n\n\nIn March 2019, Ko named Tsai Ping-kun a deputy mayor of Taipei.[59]\n\n\n\n## 2024 presidential elections[edit]\n\n\nHe is a candidate for the 2024 Taiwanese presidential elections, for the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), being the only individual to register in the party's presidential primary.[60][61]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2023, TPP and KMT leadership announced a plan to field a single joint presidential ticket consisting of Ko and KMT candidate Hou Yu-ih, with the order to be determined by opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November.[62] However, Ko was unable to come to an agreement with the KMT leadership, and on 19 November he publicly affirmed that he still intended to run as the presidential candidate of the TPP.[63]\n\n\n\n## Political stances[edit]\n\n\nKo provided support from the medical community when Chen Shui-bian was elected as Taipei City Mayor in 1994,[64] as well as during his 2000 Presidential bid, when he ultimately took two weeks off work to support Chen's fundraising efforts.[65] Ko is also a long-time member of the “Friends of A-bian Club”. As President, Chen opened the Ketagalan Institute in 2003, but the school was suspended for 3 years starting in 2008 after Chen stepped down and corruption charges were brought against the former president. In November 2012, the school resumed enrollment and Ko enrolled in a month-long course as a student under the guidance of Legislator Gao Jyh-peng, a long-time friend of Chen's.[66][67][68]\n\n\nOn 20 June 2012, Ko organised a small treatment team for Chen Shui-bian, whose condition had worsened since his imprisonment, and issued a public statement signed by many prominent individuals in the medical community to demand Chen be released for medical treatment.[69] Ko has made numerous statements expressing his view that Chen should be released for treatment, and has also expressed his view that Chen's prosecution was purely political.[70][71][72][73][74][75]\n\n\nKo supported Tsai Ing-wen in her Presidential bid in 2012 and helped fundraising efforts for her campaign. He is also a permanent member of the pro-Tsai “Friends of Ing Club”.[76] Nevertheless, he has criticized Tsai's proposal for a Taiwan Consensus over lack of clarity.[77]\n\n\nKo has mentioned that his strategic goals are the same as those of the DPP.[78] He has expressed his dislike for the KMT on numerous occasions.[79] However, in September 2016, he reiterated that he would not join the DPP, and would remain independent until his mayoral term ended.[80]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKo's wife, Chen Pei-chi, was born in Penghu, Taiwan.[81] She graduated from Makung Senior High School and National Taiwan University's Department of Medicine. She is the director of Pediatrics for Taipei City Hospital, Heping Fuyou Women and Children's Health Branch. Ko and Chen had an arranged marriage, and have three children, one boy and two girls.[82] It is known throughout Taiwan that as a mayor Ko earns less than his wife. He once joked that in order to pay off their home mortgage, his wife still could not retire early.[83] Ko has claimed to have Asperger syndrome,[84][85] but, as of 2014, had not been diagnosed.[86] His son also has the condition.[87]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Independent Is Elected Taipei Mayor as Taiwan's Governing Party Falters\n2. **^** \"Biography at NTUH\".

Gou is the founder and former chairman and chief executive officer of Foxconn, the world's largest contract manufacturer of electronics.[1] Founded in 1974, Foxconn grew to become an international business empire, becoming the largest private employer and exporter in mainland China with a workforce of 1.2 million.[2] As of 2022, Gou had a net worth of US$6.8 billion.[3]\n\n\nBeginning in 2016, speculation surrounding Gou's political ambitions arose ahead of the 2020 presidential election.[4][5][6][7] In 2019, Gou resigned from Foxconn and joined the Kuomintang (KMT) to run for president, declaring he was instructed by the sea goddess Mazu in a dream to contest the election.[8] Gou ultimately lost the election, coming in second in the Kuomintang primary.[9] After leaving the party following the 2019 primary, Gou rejoined in 2023 and announced his intention to run for president in the 2024 presidential election.[10] Once described as an \"old friend\" by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Gou has been characterized as friendly to Mainland business interests during his political and business career.[11][12] In December 2022, Gou was credited with helping to successfully lobby the Xi Jinping Administration to ease zero-COVID rules implemented during the pandemic.[13] On foreign policy, Gou has criticized the Taiwan independence movement and has called for a deescalation of Sino–American tensions.[14] Owing to his business background and image as a political outsider, Gou has been compared in international media to former U.S. President Donald Trump.[15][16][17]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nGou was born in Banqiao Township, Taipei County (now Banqiao District, New Taipei). His parents lived in mainland China's Shanxi Province before the Chinese Civil War and fled to Taiwan in 1949.[18] His father was a policeman who fought on behalf of the Kuomintang during the war.[17]\n\n\nAs the second child of his family, Gou received education from elementary school to post college. After graduation, he continued to work in a rubber factory, working at a grinding wheel, and medicine plant until the age of 24. Gou has an older sister and two younger brothers, Gou Tai-chiang and Tony Gou, who have both become successful businesspeople as well.\n\n\nGou fulfilled his national service obligations by joining the Republic of China Air Force as an anti-aircraft artillery officer.[19] As part of the airforce, he was stationed in Kinmen at a time when a potential People's Liberation Army invasion of the island as a stepping stone to invade Taiwan was a real fear.[20] He would be discharged in 1973.[21]\n\n\n\n## Foxconn[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gou with Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff in 2011\n![](image)United States House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, United States President Donald Trump, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, Foxconn founder and CEO Terry Gou and Christopher Murdock at Foxconn's June 2018 groundbreaking ceremony in Wisconsin.Main article: Foxconn\n\nTerry Gou founded Foxconn, established as Hon Hai Precision Industry (鴻海科技集團) in Taiwan in 1974[22] with $7,500 ($44,000 in 2021 US dollars) in startup money and a workforce of ten elderly employees. The company started off making plastic parts for television sets in a rented shed in Tucheng, a suburb of Taipei.[23] A turning point came in 1980 when he received an order from Atari to make the console joystick.[23]\n\n\nHe further expanded his business in the 1980s by embarking on an 11-month trip across the US in search of customers. As an aggressive salesman, Gou arrived uninvited into many companies headquarters and was able to get additional orders, despite having security called on him multiple times.[23]\n\n\nIn 1988 he opened his first factory in mainland China, in Shenzhen, where his largest factory remains today. Operations in China significantly increased in scale when Gou vertically integrated the assembly process and facilities for workers. The manufacturing site became a campus that included housing, dining, medical care and burial for the workers, and even chicken farming to supply the cafeteria.[23]\n\n\nIn 1996, Hon Hai started building chassis for Compaq desktops. This was a breakthrough moment that led to building the bare bones chassis for other high-profile customers, including HP, IBM, and Apple. Within just a few years, Foxconn grew into a consumer electronics giant.[23]\n\n\n\n## Other business ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, Gou argued that Apple should move its manufacturing out of mainland China to Taiwan. The comments came after he confirmed he will step down from his role as Foxconn chairman.[24][25]\n\n\nGou is also the main owner of HMD Global, which is a company founded in 2016 to sell Nokia branded phones. HMD buys the R&D, manufacturing and distribution from FIH Ltd, which is part of Hon Hai group.\n\n\nIn April 2021, Gou became the biggest shareholder in the biotech company Eirgenix.[26] In December 2022, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that a letter from Gou helped convince the Chinese government to ease Zero-COVID restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic.[13]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nGou first joined the Kuomintang in 1970, but allowed his membership to lapse after 2000.[27] In the 2012 Taiwan presidential election, Gou endorsed Ma Ying-jeou,[28][29] stating that Ma was an \"experienced, outstanding helmsman.\"[30] After Donald Trump won the 2016 United States presidential election, Gou was the subject of a spoof open letter in *Bloomberg*, in which author Tim Culpan was severely critical of Trump.[31] The article was mistakenly reported as having been written by Gou himself.[32]\n\n\n\n### Political views[edit]\n\n\nAn opponent of the Taiwan independence movement, Gou claims the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) \"exalts Taiwan independence and hates and opposes China\".[14] His position is that that Taiwan independence is not an issue.[33] Instead, he supports the 1992 Consensus under the one-China framework,[34][35] and has criticized the Democratic Progressive Party for political wordplay in their interpretation of the consensus.[36]\n\n\nIn 2019, Gou expressed misgivings about the legalization of same-sex marriage in Taiwan, arguing that the Legislative Yuan did not respect the results of the 2018 referendum where a majority voted against legalization.[37]\n\n\n\n### 2020 presidential election[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2016, it was widely reported that Gou was considering a 2020 Taiwanese presidential bid,[4][5] and speculation continued into 2017.[6][7] He rejoined the Kuomintang in April 2019.[38] On 17 April 2019, Gou announced his intention to run in the Kuomintang primary for the 2020 presidential election.[39][40]\n\n\nGou declared that he had been instructed by the sea goddess Mazu in a dream to run as a candidate in the 2020 presidential election of the Republic of China.[8] He finished second in the 2019 Kuomintang presidential primary, with 27.7% of the vote. On 12 September 2019, Gou announced his withdrawal from the Kuomintang.[9][41] Four days later, Gou stated that he would not participate in the 2020 presidential election as an independent candidate.[42][43] Gou was offered the top position on the Taiwan People's Party party list for the 2020 legislative election, but declined such a bid.[44]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2019 Kuomintang Republic of China presidential primary results\n |\n| --- |\n| Candidates\n | Place\n | Result\n |\n| Han Kuo-yu | **Nominated** | 44.81%\n |\n| Terry Gou\n | 2nd\n | 27.73%\n |\n| Eric Chu | 3rd\n | 17.90%\n |\n| Chou Hsi-wei | 4th\n | 6.02%\n |\n| Chang Ya-chung | 5th\n | 3.54%\n |\n\n\n### 2024 presidential election[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2023, Gou announced he would run for President in the 2024 election.[10] Polling conducted in January 2023 found him in second place in a hypothetical KMT primary with Hou Yu-ih, the Mayor of New Taipei, receiving 28.6% of the vote versus Hou's 36.7%.[45] Gou formally declared his independent presidential bid on August 28.[46] On September 2, Foxconn announced that Gou had resigned his position on the board of directors for personal reasons.[47]\n\n\nOn 14 September 2023, Gou announced as his running mate the actress and writer Lai Pei-hsia, also known as Tammy Lai.[48]\n\n\nGou officially qualified for the presidential election on 14 November 2023, when the signatures he had collected in order to run as an independent candidate were validated by Taiwan's Central Election Commission.[49]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\nGou's status as a billionaire businessman and relative political outsider, Gou was compared to Trump in international media during his 2019 presidential candidacy.[15][16][17]\n\n\nIn 2007, Gou cited Genghis Khan as a personal hero.[50][51] Gou reportedly wears a beaded bracelet procured at a temple dedicated to the Genghis Khan, which he wears on his right wrist.[52][50]\n\n\n\n### \"Animal\" management comment controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, a controversy arose after Gou compared Foxconn's workforce to animals during a board meeting.[53][54] The *Xinhua News Agency* reported that while speaking on the challenges of presiding over a workforce with over one million employees, Gou stated that as \"human beings are also animals, to manage one million animals gives me a headache.\"[55]\n\n\nFoxconn defended Gou's comments at the conference, stating that \"Mr. Gou did say that, since all humans are members of the animal kingdom, it might be possible to learn from Mr. Chin’s experience as his team looks for lessons that can be applied to business.\" Moreover, Foxconn clarified that Gou's comments were not discriminatory, explaining that \"Mr. Gou’s comments were directed at all humans and not at any specific group\".[56]\n\n\n\n### Anti-Korean comment[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2012, Gou stated that he had \"great esteem for Japanese (businessmen), especially those who are able to disagree with you in person and not stab you in the back, unlike the *Gaoli bangzi*\". *Gaoli bangzi* is a racial slur for Korean people.[57]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGou and his first wife, Serena Lin (林淑如; *Lín Shúrú*; 1950–2005), have a son who works in the film and real estate industries and a daughter who worked in the financial sector.[58] Gou founded an educational charity with Lin in 2000 and intended to eventually give away one third of his wealth to charity.[2] After Gou's wife died, Gou's daughter assumed leadership in the charity.[58]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Gou had an extramarital affair with Chen Chung-mei, a bar girl according to Gou, who had a private investigator videotape her and Gou having sex in order to blackmail Gou for money. While Gou first agreed to pay the money, when they next met he had police arrest Chen and the private investigator, Hsu Ching-wei, and sued them for extortion, stating he knew the affair would become \"exposed one way or another\".[59]\n\n\nIn 2002, he bought a Roztěž [cs] castle near Kutná Hora in the Czech Republic for $30 million.[60]\n\n\nIn 2005, Serena Lin died of breast cancer at the age of 55.[23][61] Gou's younger brother, Tony Gou, died in 2007 of leukemia.[62][63] Also that year, Hsu Ching-wei accused Gou of having an affair during the 1990s.[64] Gou married his second wife, choreographer Delia Tseng [zh] (born 1974) on 26 July 2008.[65] Tseng and Gou have three children.[66] Together, they have decided to give 90% of Gou's wealth away.[58]\n\n\n\n### Wealth[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Gou's net worth was US$5.6 billion.[67] By August 2017, *Forbes* listed his net worth at US$10.6 billion.[68] As of 2022, Gou had a net worth of US$6.8 billion, making him the sixth wealthiest person in Taiwan.[3]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Terry Gou\".

Gou is the founder and former chairman and chief executive officer of Foxconn, the world's largest contract manufacturer of electronics.[1] Founded in 1974, Foxconn grew to become an international business empire, becoming the largest private employer and exporter in mainland China with a workforce of 1.2 million.[2] As of 2022, Gou had a net worth of US$6.8 billion.[3]\n\n\nBeginning in 2016, speculation surrounding Gou's political ambitions arose ahead of the 2020 presidential election.[4][5][6][7] In 2019, Gou resigned from Foxconn and joined the Kuomintang (KMT) to run for president, declaring he was instructed by the sea goddess Mazu in a dream to contest the election.[8] Gou ultimately lost the election, coming in second in the Kuomintang primary.[9] After leaving the party following the 2019 primary, Gou rejoined in 2023 and announced his intention to run for president in the 2024 presidential election.[10] Once described as an \"old friend\" by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Gou has been characterized as friendly to Mainland business interests during his political and business career.[11][12] In December 2022, Gou was credited with helping to successfully lobby the Xi Jinping Administration to ease zero-COVID rules implemented during the pandemic.[13] On foreign policy, Gou has criticized the Taiwan independence movement and has called for a deescalation of Sino–American tensions.[14] Owing to his business background and image as a political outsider, Gou has been compared in international media to former U.S. President Donald Trump.[15][16][17]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nGou was born in Banqiao Township, Taipei County (now Banqiao District, New Taipei). His parents lived in mainland China's Shanxi Province before the Chinese Civil War and fled to Taiwan in 1949.[18] His father was a policeman who fought on behalf of the Kuomintang during the war.[17]\n\n\nAs the second child of his family, Gou received education from elementary school to post college. After graduation, he continued to work in a rubber factory, working at a grinding wheel, and medicine plant until the age of 24. Gou has an older sister and two younger brothers, Gou Tai-chiang and Tony Gou, who have both become successful businesspeople as well.\n\n\nGou fulfilled his national service obligations by joining the Republic of China Air Force as an anti-aircraft artillery officer.[19] As part of the airforce, he was stationed in Kinmen at a time when a potential People's Liberation Army invasion of the island as a stepping stone to invade Taiwan was a real fear.[20] He would be discharged in 1973.[21]\n\n\n\n## Foxconn[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gou with Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff in 2011\n![](image)United States House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, United States President Donald Trump, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, Foxconn founder and CEO Terry Gou and Christopher Murdock at Foxconn's June 2018 groundbreaking ceremony in Wisconsin.Main article: Foxconn\n\nTerry Gou founded Foxconn, established as Hon Hai Precision Industry (鴻海科技集團) in Taiwan in 1974[22] with $7,500 ($44,000 in 2021 US dollars) in startup money and a workforce of ten elderly employees. The company started off making plastic parts for television sets in a rented shed in Tucheng, a suburb of Taipei.[23] A turning point came in 1980 when he received an order from Atari to make the console joystick.[23]\n\n\nHe further expanded his business in the 1980s by embarking on an 11-month trip across the US in search of customers. As an aggressive salesman, Gou arrived uninvited into many companies headquarters and was able to get additional orders, despite having security called on him multiple times.[23]\n\n\nIn 1988 he opened his first factory in mainland China, in Shenzhen, where his largest factory remains today. Operations in China significantly increased in scale when Gou vertically integrated the assembly process and facilities for workers. The manufacturing site became a campus that included housing, dining, medical care and burial for the workers, and even chicken farming to supply the cafeteria.[23]\n\n\nIn 1996, Hon Hai started building chassis for Compaq desktops. This was a breakthrough moment that led to building the bare bones chassis for other high-profile customers, including HP, IBM, and Apple. Within just a few years, Foxconn grew into a consumer electronics giant.[23]\n\n\n\n## Other business ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, Gou argued that Apple should move its manufacturing out of mainland China to Taiwan. The comments came after he confirmed he will step down from his role as Foxconn chairman.[24][25]\n\n\nGou is also the main owner of HMD Global, which is a company founded in 2016 to sell Nokia branded phones. HMD buys the R&D, manufacturing and distribution from FIH Ltd, which is part of Hon Hai group.\n\n\nIn April 2021, Gou became the biggest shareholder in the biotech company Eirgenix.[26] In December 2022, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that a letter from Gou helped convince the Chinese government to ease Zero-COVID restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic.[13]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nGou first joined the Kuomintang in 1970, but allowed his membership to lapse after 2000.[27] In the 2012 Taiwan presidential election, Gou endorsed Ma Ying-jeou,[28][29] stating that Ma was an \"experienced, outstanding helmsman.\"[30] After Donald Trump won the 2016 United States presidential election, Gou was the subject of a spoof open letter in *Bloomberg*, in which author Tim Culpan was severely critical of Trump.[31] The article was mistakenly reported as having been written by Gou himself.[32]\n\n\n\n### Political views[edit]\n\n\nAn opponent of the Taiwan independence movement, Gou claims the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) \"exalts Taiwan independence and hates and opposes China\".[14] His position is that that Taiwan independence is not an issue.[33] Instead, he supports the 1992 Consensus under the one-China framework,[34][35] and has criticized the Democratic Progressive Party for political wordplay in their interpretation of the consensus.[36]\n\n\nIn 2019, Gou expressed misgivings about the legalization of same-sex marriage in Taiwan, arguing that the Legislative Yuan did not respect the results of the 2018 referendum where a majority voted against legalization.[37]\n\n\n\n### 2020 presidential election[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2016, it was widely reported that Gou was considering a 2020 Taiwanese presidential bid,[4][5] and speculation continued into 2017.[6][7] He rejoined the Kuomintang in April 2019.[38] On 17 April 2019, Gou announced his intention to run in the Kuomintang primary for the 2020 presidential election.[39][40]\n\n\nGou declared that he had been instructed by the sea goddess Mazu in a dream to run as a candidate in the 2020 presidential election of the Republic of China.[8] He finished second in the 2019 Kuomintang presidential primary, with 27.7% of the vote. On 12 September 2019, Gou announced his withdrawal from the Kuomintang.[9][41] Four days later, Gou stated that he would not participate in the 2020 presidential election as an independent candidate.[42][43] Gou was offered the top position on the Taiwan People's Party party list for the 2020 legislative election, but declined such a bid.[44]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2019 Kuomintang Republic of China presidential primary results\n |\n| --- |\n| Candidates\n | Place\n | Result\n |\n| Han Kuo-yu | **Nominated** | 44.81%\n |\n| Terry Gou\n | 2nd\n | 27.73%\n |\n| Eric Chu | 3rd\n | 17.90%\n |\n| Chou Hsi-wei | 4th\n | 6.02%\n |\n| Chang Ya-chung | 5th\n | 3.54%\n |\n\n\n### 2024 presidential election[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2023, Gou announced he would run for President in the 2024 election.[10] Polling conducted in January 2023 found him in second place in a hypothetical KMT primary with Hou Yu-ih, the Mayor of New Taipei, receiving 28.6% of the vote versus Hou's 36.7%.[45] Gou formally declared his independent presidential bid on August 28.[46] On September 2, Foxconn announced that Gou had resigned his position on the board of directors for personal reasons.[47]\n\n\nOn 14 September 2023, Gou announced as his running mate the actress and writer Lai Pei-hsia, also known as Tammy Lai.[48]\n\n\nGou officially qualified for the presidential election on 14 November 2023, when the signatures he had collected in order to run as an independent candidate were validated by Taiwan's Central Election Commission.[49]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\nGou's status as a billionaire businessman and relative political outsider, Gou was compared to Trump in international media during his 2019 presidential candidacy.[15][16][17]\n\n\nIn 2007, Gou cited Genghis Khan as a personal hero.[50][51] Gou reportedly wears a beaded bracelet procured at a temple dedicated to the Genghis Khan, which he wears on his right wrist.[52][50]\n\n\n\n### \"Animal\" management comment controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, a controversy arose after Gou compared Foxconn's workforce to animals during a board meeting.[53][54] The *Xinhua News Agency* reported that while speaking on the challenges of presiding over a workforce with over one million employees, Gou stated that as \"human beings are also animals, to manage one million animals gives me a headache.\"[55]\n\n\nFoxconn defended Gou's comments at the conference, stating that \"Mr. Gou did say that, since all humans are members of the animal kingdom, it might be possible to learn from Mr. Chin’s experience as his team looks for lessons that can be applied to business.\" Moreover, Foxconn clarified that Gou's comments were not discriminatory, explaining that \"Mr. Gou’s comments were directed at all humans and not at any specific group\".[56]\n\n\n\n### Anti-Korean comment[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2012, Gou stated that he had \"great esteem for Japanese (businessmen), especially those who are able to disagree with you in person and not stab you in the back, unlike the *Gaoli bangzi*\". *Gaoli bangzi* is a racial slur for Korean people.[57]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGou and his first wife, Serena Lin (林淑如; *Lín Shúrú*; 1950–2005), have a son who works in the film and real estate industries and a daughter who worked in the financial sector.[58] Gou founded an educational charity with Lin in 2000 and intended to eventually give away one third of his wealth to charity.[2] After Gou's wife died, Gou's daughter assumed leadership in the charity.[58]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Gou had an extramarital affair with Chen Chung-mei, a bar girl according to Gou, who had a private investigator videotape her and Gou having sex in order to blackmail Gou for money. While Gou first agreed to pay the money, when they next met he had police arrest Chen and the private investigator, Hsu Ching-wei, and sued them for extortion, stating he knew the affair would become \"exposed one way or another\".[59]\n\n\nIn 2002, he bought a Roztěž [cs] castle near Kutná Hora in the Czech Republic for $30 million.[60]\n\n\nIn 2005, Serena Lin died of breast cancer at the age of 55.[23][61] Gou's younger brother, Tony Gou, died in 2007 of leukemia.[62][63] Also that year, Hsu Ching-wei accused Gou of having an affair during the 1990s.[64] Gou married his second wife, choreographer Delia Tseng [zh] (born 1974) on 26 July 2008.[65] Tseng and Gou have three children.[66] Together, they have decided to give 90% of Gou's wealth away.[58]\n\n\n\n### Wealth[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Gou's net worth was US$5.6 billion.[67] By August 2017, *Forbes* listed his net worth at US$10.6 billion.[68] As of 2022, Gou had a net worth of US$6.8 billion, making him the sixth wealthiest person in Taiwan.[3]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Terry Gou\".
