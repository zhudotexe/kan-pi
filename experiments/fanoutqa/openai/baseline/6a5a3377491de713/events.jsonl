It stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Tomas Arana, Ralf Möller, Oliver Reed (in his final role), Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, Richard Harris, and Tommy Flanagan. Crowe portrays Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when Commodus, the ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator and rises through the ranks of the arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.\n\n\nInspired by Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 book *Those About to Die* (formerly titled *The Way of the Gladiator*), the script, initially written by Franzoni, was acquired by DreamWorks, and Ridley Scott signed-on to direct the film. Principal photography began in January 1999 and wrapped-up in May of that year, after having experienced a range of problems due to the script being unfinished. Several members of the cast complained about the writing quality throughout the nineteen-week shoot in Fort Ricasoli, Malta, forcing many rewrites. Production complications were further exacerbated when Oliver Reed died of a heart attack before production was finished; British post-production company The Mill, whom oversaw the film's CGI effects, were then tasked with creating a digital body double for the remaining scenes involving his character, Proximo.\n\n\nDespite its troubled production, *Gladiator* was anticipated to be one of the year's most successful films; upon its release, the film grossed over $503 million worldwide, becoming the second highest-grossing film of 2000 (behind *Mission: Impossible 2*). Critics praised the acting—particularly Crowe's and Phoenix's performances—Scott's direction, the visuals, screenplay, action sequences, musical score, and the production values, although its somewhat dark and brooding tone was criticised by some. Earning numerous accolades, *Gladiator* won five Academy Awards at the 73rd Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Crowe. *Gladiator* is known for having revitalized (or established) the careers of its cast and crew, elevating Crowe to leading man status, and turning Phoenix into a celebrity.\n\n\nSince its release, *Gladiator* has been critically reevaluated. It is now widely considered one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the greatest historical epic films ever made. It has been credited with reinventing the sword-and-sandal genre, after waning in the public eye during the 1960s; the film rekindled interest in films centered around the cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and other iconic periods throughout world history. Several films have attempted to emulate *Gladiator*'s visuals, style, and tone with varying degrees of success. The film has been analyzed for its themes of revenge, violence, masculinity, and stoicism. In 2021, Scott announced that writing had begun on a sequel,[8] which is scheduled to be released in the US on November 22, 2024.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 180 AD, Hispano-Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return home after he leads the Roman army to victory against Germanic tribes near Vindobona on the Limes Germanicus. Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus, is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to restore the Roman Republic. Marcus Aurelius informs Commodus; in response, Commodus murders his father.\n\n\nCommodus proclaims himself the new emperor and requests loyalty from Maximus, who refuses. Maximus is arrested by the Praetorian Guard and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and, wounded, rides for his home near Turgalium, where he finds his wife and son crucified. Maximus buries them and collapses from his injuries.  Slavers find him and take him to the city of Zucchabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to gladiator trainer Proximo.\n\n\nMaximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He befriends two other gladiators: Hagen, a German; and Juba, a Numidian. In Rome, Commodus organises 150 days of games to commemorate his father's death. Upon hearing this, Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to \"win the crowd\" to win his freedom.\n\n\nProximo takes his gladiators to Rome to fight in the Colosseum. Disguised in a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the Colosseum as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to reveal his identity; Maximus removes his helmet and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let Maximus and the gladiators live. \n\n\nLucilla, Commodus's sister and Maximus's former lover, visits Maximus in his cell and offers her help, but he refuses. Meanwhile, Commodus arranges a duel between Maximus and Tigris of Gaul, an undefeated gladiator. Several tigers are set upon Maximus during the duel, but he prevails. Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his opponent's life. In response, the crowd chants \"Maximus the Merciful\", which angers Commodus. Increasingly paranoid, Commodus instructs his advisor, Falco, to have every senator followed. \n\n\nMaximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. He meets in secret with Lucilla and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to help Maximus escape Rome to join his legions, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. The Praetorians arrest Gracchus, and Commodus learns of the plot when Lucilla's son, Lucius, innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorians attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed.\n\n\nTo win back public approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus in the lung before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms Commodus during the duel. After the Praetorians refuse to aid him, Commodus unsheathes a hidden knife; Maximus overpowers Commodus and drives the knife into his throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wounds, he asks for political reforms, the freedom of his gladiator allies, and the reinstatement of Senator Gracchus. As he dies, Maximus envisions reuniting with his wife and son in the afterlife. His friends and allies honor him as \"a soldier of Rome\", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena.\n\n\nThat night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nRussell Crowe (left) in 2017 and Joaquin Phoenix in 2018\n\n* Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius: A Hispano-Roman legatus forced into becoming a slave who seeks revenge against Commodus. He has earned the favor of Marcus Aurelius and the love and admiration of Lucilla prior to the events of the film. His home is near Trujillo in today's Province of Cáceres, Spain. After the murder of his family he vows vengeance.\n* Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus: The amoral, power-hungry, psychopathic son of Marcus Aurelius.

After gaining power, he seeks to weaken the power of the Senate and establish  absolute rule.\n* Connie Nielsen as Lucilla: Maximus's former lover and the older child of Marcus Aurelius. Lucilla has been recently widowed. She resists her brother's incestuous advances while protecting her son, Lucius, from her brother's corruption and wrath.\n* Oliver Reed as Antonius Proximo: An old, gruff gladiator trainer who buys Maximus in North Africa. A former gladiator himself, he was freed by Marcus Aurelius and becomes a mentor to both Maximus and Juba. This was Reed's final film appearance, as he died during the filming. In the original film script Proximo was supposed to live. Richard Harris, who was later cast as Marcus Aurelius, was considered for the part.\n* Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus: A member of the Roman Senate who opposes Commodus's rule and an ally of Lucilla and Maximus. In the original film script Gracchus was supposed to die.\n* Djimon Hounsou as Juba: A Numidian tribesman who was taken from his home and family by slave traders.

Even as I went east, going through Turkey, I began to think to myself this must have been a hell of a franchise.\" During a stop in Baghdad, Iraq, he stopped reading a book about the Irish Revolution for another one: Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 novel *Those About to Die.* These experiences planted the seeds of inspiration for a story about gladiators set in the Roman Empire.\n\n\nTwenty-five years later, Franzoni wrote the screenplay for Steven Spielberg's *Amistad,* which was the director's first film for DreamWorks Pictures. Though *Amistad* was only a moderate commercial success, DreamWorks was impressed with Franzoni's screenplay and gave him a three-picture deal as writer and co-producer. Remembering his 1972 trip, Franzoni pitched his Roman history idea to Spielberg, who immediately told him to write the script.[10]\n\n\nIn the first draft, dated April 4, 1998, Franzoni chose to base his story on Commodus after reading the ancient Roman text *Historia Augusta*. He later named his protagonist Narcissus, a wrestler who, according to the ancient sources Herodian and Cassius Dio, strangled Emperor Commodus to death.[12]\n\n\n\n![Several dead men and various scattered weapons are located in a large arena.

The man has his right foot on the throat of an injured man who is reaching towards the crowd. Members of the crowd are indicating a \"thumbs down\" gesture. The arena is adorned with marble, columns, flags, and statues.](image)*Pollice Verso (Thumbs Down)* by Jean-Léon Gérôme, the 19th-century painting that inspired Ridley Scott to tackle the project\nRidley Scott was approached by producers Walter F. Parkes and Douglas Wick. They showed him a copy of Jean-Léon Gérôme's 1872 painting entitled *Pollice Verso (Thumbs Down)*.[13] Scott was enticed by the idea of filming the world of Ancient Rome. However, he felt Franzoni's dialogue lacked subtlety and hired John Logan to rewrite the script to his liking. Logan rewrote much of the first act and made the decision to kill off Maximus's family to increase the character's desire for revenge.[14]\n\n\nWhile the script was being revised and the production crew was being assembled, DreamWorks began circling several potential partners to help cover the film's budget and costs. Co-financing between studios became increasingly common during the late-1990s as production and marketing costs and the potential for losses spiralled upward.[15] DreamWorks saw success with its split-rights deals as the studio shared financing and distribution for the 1998 films *Saving Private Ryan* and *Deep Impact* with Paramount Pictures. On November 12, 1998, *Variety* reported that Universal Pictures reached a deal with DreamWorks to help finance the film, as well as obtain international distribution rights and split worldwide proceeds 50–50 with DreamWorks, which would distribute the film in North America.[15]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oliver Reed (pictured in 1968) portrayed Proximo.\nWhile writing the script, Franzoni expressed interest in Antonio Banderas as the lead role, but he declined. Mel Gibson, Tom Sizemore, and Tom Cruise were considered for the film, but the producers and studio had Russell Crowe at the top of their list after his breakout performance in *L.A. Confidential* (1997).[16] Crowe was initially hesitant to join the project due to gaining forty pounds for *The Insider* (1999)*,* but director Michael Mann convinced the actor to take the role.[17] He eventually signed on to play the main character in September 1998.[18] Crowe would later state that he was pitched by Parkes with the script still unfinished. In his interview for *Inside the Actors Studio*: \"They said, 'It's a 100-million-dollar film. You're being directed by Ridley Scott. You play a Roman general.' I've always been a big fan of Ridley's.\"[19]\n\n\nJude Law auditioned for the role of Commodus, but Scott landed his number-one choice, Joaquin Phoenix.[20] Jennifer Lopez reportedly lobbied for the role of Lucilla, but lost out to Connie Nielsen.[20] Crowe initially suggested his *Insider* costar Christopher Plummer prior to Richard Harris being cast in the role of Marcus Aurelius. From there, Ralf Möller, Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, and Tommy Flanagan joined the cast as pre-production was ready to commence.\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nIn preparation for filming, Scott spent several months developing storyboards to develop the framework of the plot.[21] Over six weeks, production members scouted various locations within the extent of the Roman Empire before its collapse, including Italy, France, North Africa, and England.[22] All of the film's props, sets, and costumes were manufactured by crew members due to the high costs and unavailability of the items.[23]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\nScott and Franzoni drew on several influences for Gladiator, including *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*, *La Dolce Vita* and *The Conformist*. The film's plot was influenced by two 1960s Hollywood films of the sword-and-sandal genre, *The Fall of the Roman Empire* and *Spartacus*,[24] and shares several plot points with *The Fall of the Roman Empire*, which tells the story of Livius, who, like Maximus in *Gladiator*, is Marcus Aurelius's intended successor. Livius is in love with Lucilla and seeks to marry her while Maximus, who is happily married, was formerly in love with her. Both films portray the death of Marcus Aurelius as an assassination. In *The Fall of the Roman Empire* a group of conspirators independent of Commodus, hoping to profit from Commodus's accession, arrange for Marcus Aurelius to be poisoned. In *Gladiator,* Commodus himself murders his father by smothering him. \n\n\nIn the course of *The Fall of the Roman Empire,* Commodus unsuccessfully seeks to win Livius over to his vision of empire in contrast to that of his father, but continues to employ him notwithstanding; in *Gladiator*, when Commodus fails to secure Maximus's allegiance, he executes Maximus's wife and son and tries unsuccessfully to execute him, too. Livius and Maximus both kill Commodus in single combat for the greater good of Rome in addition to personal motivations: Livius to save Lucilla and Maximus to avenge the murder of his family.\n\n\nScott cited *Spartacus* and *Ben-Hur* as influences on the film: \"These movies were part of my cinema-going youth. But at the dawn of the new millennium, I thought this might be the ideal time to revisit what may have been the most important period of the last two thousand years – if not all recorded history – the apex and beginning of the decline of the greatest military and political power the world has ever known.\"[25]\n\n\n*Spartacus* provides the film's gladiatorial motif, as well as the character of Senator Gracchus, a fictitious senator, bearing the name of a pair of revolutionary tribunes from the 2nd century BC, who in both films is an elder statesman of ancient Rome attempting to preserve the ancient rights of the Roman Senate in the face of an ambitious autocrat – Marcus Licinius Crassus in *Spartacus* and Commodus in *Gladiator.* Both actors who played Gracchus (in *Spartacus* and *Gladiator*) played Claudius in previous films: Charles Laughton of *Spartacus* played Claudius in the unfinished 1937 film *I, Claudius* and Derek Jacobi of *Gladiator* played Claudius in the 1976 BBC adaptation. Both films also share a specific set piece wherein a gladiator (Maximus here, Woody Strode's Draba in *Spartacus*) throws his weapon into a spectator box at the end of a match, as well as at least one line of dialogue: \"Rome is the mob\", said here by Gracchus and by Julius Caesar (John Gavin) in *Spartacus*.\n\n\n\n## Filming[edit]\n\n\n### Principal photography[edit]\n\n\nThe film was shot in three main locations between January and May 1999. The opening battle scenes set in the forests of Germania were shot in three weeks in the Bourne Woods, near Farnham, Surrey, in England.[26] When Scott learned that the Forestry Commission planned to remove a section of the forest, he persuaded them to allow the battle scene to be shot there and burn it down.[27] Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson used multiple cameras filming at various frame rates and a 45-degree shutter,[7] creating stop motion effects in the action sequences, similar to techniques used for the battle sequences of *Saving Private Ryan* (1998).[28]\n\n\nThe scenes of slavery, desert travel, and the gladiatorial training school were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco, just south of the Atlas Mountains over a further three weeks.[29] To construct the arena where Maximus has his first fights, the crew used basic materials and local building techniques to manufacture the 30,000-seat mud brick arena.[30] The scenes set in Rome were shot over a period of nineteen weeks in Fort Ricasoli, Malta.[31][32]\n\n\nIn Malta, a replica of about one-third of Rome's Colosseum was built to a height of 52 feet (16 meters), mostly from plaster and plywood. The other two-thirds and remaining height were added digitally.[33] The replica took several months to build and cost an estimated $1 million.[34] The reverse side of the complex supplied a rich assortment of Ancient Roman street furniture, colonnades, gates, statuary, and marketplaces for other filming requirements. The complex was serviced by tented \"costume villages\" that had to change rooms, storage, armorers, and other facilities.[31] The rest of the Colosseum was created in computer-generated imagery using set-design blueprints and textures referenced from live action, and rendered in three layers to provide lighting flexibility for compositing in Flame and Inferno software.[35]\n\n\nWhile Crowe and Harris became good friends during filming, the actor did not get along with Reed. In a 2010 interview with *GQ*, Crowe stated that he \"never got on with Ollie. He has visited me in dreams and asked me to talk kindly of him. So I should... but we never had a pleasant conversation.\" Crowe was uncomfortable with Reed's excessive drinking during filming. Phoenix was initially anxious about filming and requested Scott he drop out early in production. To help calm the then 25-year-old Phoenix's nerves, Crowe and Harris decided to get him drunk. \"It was actually Richard Harris' idea,\" Crowe later recalled, \"because Joaquin was very nervous on the set and I went to Richard and said, 'Mate, what are we gonna do with this kid, he's asking me to abuse him before takes.'\"[36]\n\n\n\n### Script revisions and complaints[edit]\n\n\nThroughout filmmaking, the actors complained about problems with the script. William Nicholson was brought to Shepperton Studios to make Maximus a more sensitive character. Nicholson reworked Maximus' friendship with Juba and developed the afterlife thread in the film, saying, \"he did not want to see a film about a man who wanted to kill somebody.\"[14] The screenplay faced many rewrites and revisions, with several actors providing changes.[37] Crowe questioned every aspect of the evolving script and strode off the set when he did not get answers. According to Nicholson, Crowe reportedly told him that his \"lines are garbage, but I'm the greatest actor in the world and I can make even garbage sound good.\"\n\n\nAccording to a DreamWorks executive, Crowe \"tried to rewrite the entire script on the spot. You know the big line in the trailer, 'In this life or the next, I will have my vengeance'? At first he absolutely refused to say it.\"[38] Crowe described the script situation: \"I read the script and it was substantially underdone. Even the character didn't exist on the pages. And that set about a long process, that's probably the first time that I've been in a situation where the script wasn't a complete done deal. We actually started shooting with about 32 pages and went through them in the first couple of weeks.\"[19]\n\n\nCrowe threatened to kill Lustig with his bare hands due to him refusing to pay his assistants.[39]\n\n\nOf the writing and filming process, Crowe added, \"Possibly, a lot of the stuff that I have to deal with now in terms of my 'volatility' has to do with that experience. Here was a situation where we got to Morocco with a crew of 200 and a cast of a 100 or whatever, and I didn't have anything to learn. I actually didn't know what the scenes were gonna be. We had, I think, one American writer working on it, one English writer working on it, and of course a group of producers who were also adding their ideas, and then Ridley himself; and then, on the occasion where Ridley would say, 'Look, this is the structure for it– what are you gonna say in that?' So then I'd be doing my own stuff, as well. And this is how things like, 'Strength and honor,' came up. This is how things like, 'At my signal, unleash hell,' came up. The name Maximus Decimus Meridius, it just flowed well.\"[19]\n\n\nMaximus' habit of rubbing soil before each fight references the attachment and affection to his former life as a farmer.[40] In a conversation with Marcus Aurelius, Maximus says the fecund soil of his farm is \"black like my wife's hair\".[40] Crowe wrote the speech himself, drawing on his feelings of homesickness for his own farm.[40]\n\n\n\n### Injuries[edit]\n\n\nCrowe was injured during principal photography. Detailing the impact filming had on his body during his appearance on *Inside the Actor's Studio,* Crowe described that there was a \"lot of blood, lot of blood, lot of grazes, you know, I mean, I've still got, a lot of little scar[s] here and one under here on this elbow, a discoloration of the skin that is directly to Gladiator\".[41] During filming on the sequence where Maximus fights Tigris of Gaul in the arena with tigers, Crowe narrowly escaped being clawed by a tiger.[42]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nMen in white robes with the Colosseum in the background.Several scenes included extensive use of computer-generated imagery shots for views of Rome.\nBritish post-production company The Mill was responsible for much of the computer-generated imagery effects that were added after filming. The company used such tricks as compositing real tigers filmed on bluescreen into the fight sequences, and adding smoke trails and extending the flight paths of the opening scene's salvo of flaming arrows to get around regulations on how far they could be shot during filming. They also used 2,000 live actors to create a computer-generated crowd of 35,000 virtual actors that had to look believable and react to fight scenes.[33] The Mill accomplished this by shooting live actors at different angles giving various performances, and then mapping them onto cards, with motion-capture tools used to track their movements for three-dimensional compositing.[35] The Mill created over 90 visual effects shots, comprising approximately nine minutes of the film's running time.[43]\n\n\nAn unexpected post-production job was required because of the death of Oliver Reed during the filming in Malta before all his scenes had been shot. The Mill created a digital body double for the remaining scenes involving his character Proximo[35] by photographing a live-action body double in the shadows and by performing digital face replacement by mapping a three-dimensional computer-generated image of Reed's face to the remaining scenes during production at an estimated cost of $3.2 million for two minutes of additional footage.[44][45] Visual effects supervisor John Nelson reflected on the decision to include the additional footage: \"What we did was small compared to our other tasks on the film. What Oliver did was much greater. He gave an inspiring, moving performance. All we did was help him finish it.\"[44] The film is dedicated to Reed's memory.[46]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gladiator (2000 soundtrack)\n\n![](image)\n\nHans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard – \"Now We Are Free\"\n\n\nlisten to a clip from the score of *Gladiator*.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nThe Oscar-nominated score was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, and conducted by Gavin Greenaway. Zimmer was originally planning to use Israeli vocalist Ofra Haza for the score, after his work with her in *The Prince of Egypt*. However, Haza died in late February 2000, before she was able to record, and so Gerrard was chosen instead. Lisa Gerrard's vocals are similar to her own work on *The Insider* score.[47]\n\n\nThe music for many of the battle scenes has been noted as similar to Gustav Holst's \"Mars: The Bringer of War\", and in June 2006, the Holst Foundation sued Hans Zimmer for allegedly copying the late Holst's work.[48][49] The case was settled out of court. [50] Another close musical resemblance occurs in the scene of Commodus's triumphal entry into Rome, accompanied by music clearly evocative of two sections – the Prelude to *Das Rheingold* and Siegfried's Funeral March from *Götterdämmerung* – from Richard Wagner's *Ring of the Nibelung*.\n\n\nOn February 27, 2001, nearly a year after the first soundtrack's release, Decca produced *Gladiator: More Music From the Motion Picture*. Then, on September 5, 2005, Decca produced *Gladiator: Special Anniversary Edition*, a two-CD pack containing both the above-mentioned releases. Some of the music from the film was featured in the NFL playoffs in January 2003 before commercial breaks and before and after half-time.[51] In 2003, Luciano Pavarotti released a recording of himself singing a song from the film and said he regretted turning down an offer to perform on the soundtrack.[52]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Context[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2000 in film\n\n![](image)The logo for *Gladiator*\nThe theatrical year of 1999 achieved a record $7.3 billion at the domestic box office, thanks largely to the success of *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace* and *The Sixth Sense*. Industry executives did not replicate that success with the releases in 2000, however. Increasing production costs and a lack of merchandising forced studios to concentrate marketing on the appeal of popular actors such as Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson, Eddie Murphy, Jim Carrey, and Bruce Willis to help boost ticket sales and draw in potential female audiences for their slates.[53][54][55]\n\n\nThe action sequel *Mission: Impossible 2* was expected to have the biggest success, while anticipated films such as *Dinosaur*, *Gladiator*, *The Patriot*, and *X-Men* were also expected to perform well.[53][56][57] Films such as *Battlefield Earth*, *Gone in 60 Seconds*, *The Kid*, *Me, Myself & Irene*, *Nutty Professor II: The Klumps*, *The Perfect Storm*, and *What Lies Beneath* were heavily marketed and promoted with the appeal of their leading actors that already had a built-in audience.[54][55] *Gladiator* was expected to perform well following test screenings that DreamWorks conducted between October 1999 and February 2000 that were overwhelmingly positive, but some analysts predicted the film could be impacted by the lack of a built-in audience for Crowe.[58][59][60]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Gladiator* was released in the United States and Canada on May 5, 2000.[61] During its opening weekend, *Gladiator* earned $34.8 million across 2,938 theaters—an average of $11,851 per theater—making it the number one film of the weekend, ahead of *U-571* ($7.8 million), in its first weekend, and *The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas* ($7.6 million), in its second weekend.[62][63] The film not only leapt over *Scream 3* to achieve the year's highest opening weekend, but also earned the third-highest opening weekend for an R-rated film ever, trailing only *Air Force One* (1997) and *Interview with the Vampire* (1994).[64] The film's positive word of mouth and the sex appeal of Crowe helped with bringing in a female audience during its opening weekend, with the percentage of women buying tickets increasing from 35% on its opening day to 45% the following day.[65]\n\n\nThe film remained number one in its second weekend with $24.6 million, ahead of the debut of *Battlefield Earth* ($11.5 million).[66] During its third weekend, *Gladiator* fell to second place with $19.7 million, behind the debut of *Dinosaur* ($38.5 million).[67][68] By Memorial Day, it had already earned a total of $127.2 million, surpassing *Erin Brockovich* to become the highest-grossing film of the year.[69] Without regaining the number one spot, *Gladiator* spent ten weeks in the top ten at the box office. The film was in theaters for over a year and finished its theatrical run on May 10, 2001.[70] *Gladiator* grossed $187.7 million in the United States and Canada, finishing as the fourth highest-grossing film of 2000 behind *Mission: Impossible 2* ($215.4 million), *Cast Away* ($233.6 million), and *How The Grinch Stole Christmas* ($260 million).[71]\n\n\nOutside of North America, *Gladiator* is estimated to have grossed over $272.9 million internationally.[70] This gave the film a cumulative gross of over $503.2 million worldwide against a budget of $103 million.[70] It was the second highest-grossing film of 2000 behind *Mission: Impossible 2* ($546.4 million).[70]\n\n\nDue to an increase in ticket prices, 2000 set a new record of $7.7 billion at the domestic box office, exceeding the previous year's $7.31 billion. However, attendance was estimated at being down 2.5% from 1999.[72][73] Industry executives blamed the decrease in attendance on the year's slate for its lack of commercial appeal, a dearth of female-driven films and sleeper hits, as well as several exhibition chains filing for bankruptcy.[74][73] Nevertheless, *Gladiator* was considered to be one of 2000's biggest blockbusters due to strong word of mouth, contributing to its long-lasting box office performance and DreamWorks' improving fortunes.[75][73][74]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nUpon its initial release, *Gladiator* opened to generally positive reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\n\n![](image)Connie Nielsen (pictured here in 2009) was praised by critics, notably the otherwise critical Ebert, for providing depth to the film.\nThe performances and the cast were praised by critics, with Crowe and Phoenix being considered by critics as the main highlights. Kirk Honeycutt of *The Hollywood Reporter* said Crowe \"solidly anchors this epic-scale gladiator movie - the first in nearly four decades - by using his burly frame and expressive face to give dimension to what might otherwise have been comic book heroics.\"[76] In his positive review for *The Wall Street Journal*, Joe Morgensten said that Crowe \"doesn't use tricks in this role to court our approval. He earns it the old-fashioned way, by daring to be quiet, if not silent, and intensely, implacably strong,\" and that the film \"rests on Mr. Crowe's armor-clad shoulders, and he carries it remarkably well.\"[77] *Empire*'s Ian Nathan, giving the film four stars, wrote that Phoenix displayed \"gleeful hamminess\" in his performance.[78]\n\n\nWriting about the film as a whole, Nathan expressed that \"while it's all grand opera, and driven by sweeping gestures and pompous, overwritten dialogue, it is prone to plain silliness - especially in granting us the big showdown at the close. But the sheer dynamism of the action, coupled with Hans Zimmer's lavish score and the forcefield of Crowe, still makes this a fiercesome competitor in the summer movie stakes.\"[78] Geoff Andrew of *Time Out* praised the film, saying that \"the cast is strong (notably Nielsen as Commodus's vacillating sister, and the late Oliver Reed, unusually endearing as a gladiator owner), the pacing lively, and the sets, swordplay and Scud catapults impressive.[79] Roger Ebert, who was otherwise critical in his two-star review, praised Nielsen for having the most depth in the entire film.[80] On the other hand, Camille Paglia, who called the film \"boring, badly shot and suffused with sentimental p.c. rubbish,\" criticized Crowe and Phoenix's performances[81]\n\n\nScott's directing was generally praised by critics, who called it a return to form for the director. In her A- review for *Entertainment Weekly*, Lisa Schwarzbaum praised Scott's directing, particularly during the opening battle sequence. Schwarzbaum writes that with the battle sequence, \"Scott lets loose his own extraordinary assault. It's a bravura sequence of flaming arrows, falling horses, and mortal combat that doesn't copy *Private Ryan's* famous opening tour de force of carnage so much as raise a banner in admiration. It's Scott the visual artist at his most deluxe.\" Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* wrote that \"Scott really scores in his big Rome set-pieces, especially Crowe's combat with men and tigers in a computer-enhanced Colosseum much bigger and more monumental than the original,\" and that \"for all of its implausible silliness and towering high camp, Scott's movie tells an engaging story, and the central arena fight-sequence in which Maximus and his gladiators playing the doomed Carthaginians end up defeating the Romans and reversing history \"to the emperor's horror\" is wittily and adroitly done: a sly demonstration of the confluence of politics and mass entertainment.\"[82] Michael Wilmington of *The Chicago Tribune* gave praise to Scott's direction, comparing the visual style of the film to that of Scott's 1982 film *Blade Runner*.[83]\n\n\nCritics generally praised the production values of the film, with the costumes, production design, and visual effects. Todd McCarthy, praising the film for *Variety*, said *Gladiator* \"revels in both the glory and the horror that were Rome,\" with \"details in Arthur Max's brilliant production design and Janty Yates' highly diversified costume design that offered up in wonderfully offhand fashion,\" while also commanding the \"CGI effects that have allowed numerous sets, notably the Colosseum, to be enhanced in size and spectacle value; the stunts, fights and battles are as forceful and realistic as anyone could want, John Mathieson's widescreen cinematography is magnificent, and the pacing across 2½ hours is well modulated.\" Ebert criticized the film for looking \"muddy, fuzzy and indistinct.\" In his two-star review, Ebert also derided the writing, saying it \"employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.\"[80]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by Gladiator\n\nDespite the critical and commercial success it received during its theatrical run, *Gladiator* was not initially considered a major contender for the Academy Awards. When award season talk came around towards the end of 2000, critics and journalists simply viewed the film as an enjoyable summer film, but not a major Oscar contender.[84][85] *Gladiator* and *Erin Brockovich* were singled out for their releases during the first half of the year, while contenders such as *Almost Famous*, *Billy Elliot*, *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and Traffic* were released during the fall and winter of 2000 and received awards from numerous critics groups and guild organizations.[85] When the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama at the 58th Golden Globes, media outlets began viewing *Gladiator* as the front runner for the Academy Awards.[86] Its subsequent wins for the BAFTA Award for Best Film and Produces Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture solidified *Gladiator*'s front runner status for the Oscars.[87]\n\n\nWhen nominations for the 73rd Academy Awards were announced on February 13, 2001, *Gladiator* received the most nominations with twelve, while *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* had scored ten. On March 25, 2001, the film won five Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor for Russell Crowe, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Costume Design. It was nominated for an additional seven: Best Original Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor for Joaquin Phoenix and Best Director for Ridley Scott, Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Film Editing.[88]\n\n\nIt was the first film to win Best Picture without winning either a directing or screenwriting award since *All the King's Men* at the 22nd Academy Awards in 1950. This was also the second consecutive DreamWorks film to achieve an Oscar for Best Picture after *American Beauty* the previous year.[89] Due to Academy rules, only Hans Zimmer was officially nominated for Best Original Score, and not Lisa Gerrard.[90] However, the pair did win the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score as co-composers.[91] Of its one-hundred and nineteen award nominations, *Gladiator* won a total of forty-eight prizes.[92]\n\n\n\n## Post-release[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

As Ridley Scott wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous film, he hired several historians as advisors. Some deviations from historical facts were made to increase interest, maintain narrative continuity, and for practical or safety reasons. Scott stated that due to the influence of previous films affecting the public perception of what ancient Rome was like, some historical facts were \"too unbelievable\" to include. For instance, in an early version of the script, gladiators would have been carrying out product endorsements in the arena. While this would have been historically accurate, it was not filmed for fear that audiences would think it anachronistic. \n\n\nAt least one historical advisor resigned due to these changes. Another asked not to be mentioned in the credits, though it was stated in the director's commentary that he constantly asked, \"where is the proof that certain things were exactly like they say?\" Historian Allen Ward of the University of Connecticut believed that historical accuracy would not have made *Gladiator* less interesting or exciting, stating, \"creative artists need to be granted some poetic license, but that should not be a permit for the wholesale disregard of facts in historical fiction\".\n\n\n\n### Fictionalization[edit]\n\n\nMarcus Aurelius was not murdered by his son Commodus. He died at Vindobona (modern Vienna) in 180 AD from the Antonine Plague. The epidemic, believed to be either smallpox or measles, swept across the Roman Empire during his reign. There is no indication Marcus Aurelius wished to return the Empire to a republican form of government, as depicted in the film. Moreover, he shared the rule of the Empire with Commodus for three years before his own death. Commodus then ruled alone from that point until his death at the end of 192 AD. The film depicts Marcus as defeating the barbarians in the Marcomannic Wars. In reality, the war was still ongoing when Aurelius died. Commodus secured a peace treaty with the two Germanic tribes allied against Rome, the Marcomanni and the Quadi, immediately after his father's death.\n\n\nAlthough Commodus did engage in show combat in the Colosseum, he was not killed in the arena. He was strangled in his bath by the wrestler Narcissus. Commodus reigned for over twelve years, unlike the shorter period portrayed in the film. In the film, Lucilla is portrayed as a lone widow of Lucius Verus with one son, also named Lucius Verus. While Lucilla was the widow of Verus and also had a son by that name, their son died young, long before the reign of Commodus. \n\n\nLucilla remarried Claudius Pompeianus soon after Verus' death. She had been married to him for 11 years by the time her brother became Emperor. Her only living son during this time was Aurelius Pompeianus. The film omits Lucilla's other two children with Verus, Lucilla Plautia and Aurelia Lucilla. Lucilla was implicated in a plot to assassinate her brother in 182 AD, along with her stepson by Pompeianus and several others. She was first exiled to the island of Capri by her brother, then executed on his orders later in the year.\n\n\nThe character of Maximus is fictional, although in some respects he resembles the following historical figures: Narcissus, Commodus's real-life murderer and the character's name in the first draft of the screenplay; Spartacus, who led a significant slave revolt in 73–71 BC; Cincinnatus (519–430 BC), a farmer who was made dictator, saved Rome from invasion, then resigned his six-month appointment after 15 days; and Marcus Nonius Macrinus, a trusted general, consul in 154 AD, and friend of Marcus Aurelius. \n\n\nMaximus had a similar career, and personality traits as documented by Herodian, to Claudius Pompeianus, a Syrian who married Marcus Aurelius' daughter Lucilla following the death of Lucius Verus. It is believed Aurelius may have wanted Pompeianus to succeed him as caesar, in preference to Commodus, but was turned down. Pompeianus had no part in any of the many plots against Commodus. He was not depicted in the film.\n\n\nIn the film, the character Antonius Proximo claims \"the wise\" Marcus Aurelius banned gladiatorial games in Rome, forcing him to move to Mauretania. The real Aurelius banned games, but only in Antioch as punishment for the city's support of the usurper Avidius Cassius. No games were ever banned in Rome. However, when the Emperor started conscripting gladiators into the legions, the resulting shortage in fighters allowed *lanistae* such as Proximo to make \"windfall\" profits through increased charges for their services.\n\n\nIn real life, the death of Commodus did not result in peace for Rome, nor a return to the Roman Republic. Rather, it ushered in a chaotic and bloody power struggle that culminated in the Year of the Five Emperors of AD 193. According to Herodian, the people of Rome were overjoyed at the news of Commodus dying, although they feared that the praetorians would not accept the new emperor Pertinax.\n\n\n\"Maximus Decimus Meridius\" does not appear to be a usual personal name during ancient Rome. A more accurate name would be \"Decimus Meridius Maximus\", as \"Decimus\" is a *praenomen* and \"Maximus\" is a *cognomen*. \"Proximo\" should be rendered as \"Proximus.\"\n\n\n\n### Anachronisms[edit]\n\n\n![Reconstructed Roman artillery pieces are used to locate the most likely position of Roman artillery during the battle at the Harzhorn by firing marked projectiles into the historical impact zones.](image)Roman field artillery used in open battle was far more compact and transportable than shown by the film. It was capable of creating \"killing zones\" with a low chance of survival, as proven by tightly spaced impacts on a real battlefield.\nCostumes in the film are rarely historically correct. Some soldiers wear fantasy helmets. The bands wrapped around their lower arms were rarely worn. Their appearance is the product of a cinematic stereotype where historical films depict peoples of antiquity wearing such bands. Although the film is set within the 2nd century AD, the Imperial Gallic armor and the helmets worn by the legionaries are from AD 75, a century earlier. This was superseded by new designs in AD 100. The legions' standard bearers (aquiliferi), centurions, mounted forces, and auxiliaries would have worn scale armour, lorica squamata. The Germanic tribes are dressed in clothes from the Stone Age period.\n\n\nRoman field artillery was used in combat extensively by the Romans, though within the film they are also depicted as using  onagers, which was not used by the Roman Empire until the 4th century, hundreds of years after the events of the film. The Roman cavalry are shown using stirrups. This is anachronistic in that the horse-mounted forces of the Roman army used a two-horned saddle, without stirrups. Stirrups were only employed in filming for safety reasons because of the additional training and skill required to ride with a Roman saddle.\n\n\nCatapults and ballistae would not have been used in a forest. They were reserved primarily for sieges and rarely used in open battles. Fire pots fired from catapults were not used in ancient history.\n\n\nThe Praetorian Guards all wear purple uniforms, no historical evidence supports this. On campaign, they usually wore standard legionary equipment with some unique decorative elements.\n\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Gladiator* was first released on DVD and VHS on November 21, 2000.[93] Along with *X-Men*, both films generated $60 million in home video sales each in their first week.[94] By this point, *Gladiator* had already sold 1.8 million DVD units, making it the fastest-selling DVD release at the time.[95] By January 2001, it broke *The Matrix*'s record for becoming the top-selling DVD release, selling 3.5 million copies.[96] In the United Kingdom, 500,000 copies were sold in 2000 alone.[97] With over 5 million copies sold, the film held the record for being the best-selling DVD title of all time until *Shrek* surpassed it later that year.[98]\n\n\nThe DVD has since been released in several different extended and special edition versions. Special features for the Blu-ray Disc and DVDs include deleted scenes, trailers, documentaries, commentaries, storyboards, image galleries, Easter eggs, and cast auditions. The film was released on Blu-ray in September 2009, in a 2-disc edition containing both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film, as part of Paramount's \"Sapphire Series\".[99] Initial reviews of the Blu-ray Disc release criticized poor image quality, leading many to call for it to be remastered, as Sony did with *The Fifth Element* in 2007.[100] A remastered version was later released in 2010.\n\n\nThe DVD editions that have been released since the original two-disc version, include a film-only single-disc edition as well as a three-disc \"extended edition\" DVD which was released in August 2005. The extended edition DVD features approximately fifteen minutes of additional scenes, most of which appear in the previous release as deleted scenes. The original cut, which Scott still calls his director's cut, is also selectable via seamless branching, which is not included on the UK edition. The DVD is notable for having a new commentary track featuring director Scott and star Crowe. The film is on the first disc, the second one has a three-hour documentary into the making of the film by DVD producer Charles de Lauzirika, and the third disc contains supplements. Discs one and two of the three-disc extended edition were repackaged and sold as a two-disc \"special edition\" in the EU in 2005. \n\n\nThe film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray by Paramount Home Media Distribution in May 2018.[101]\n\n\n\n## Thematic analysis[edit]\n\n\n### Revenge[edit]\n\n\nA common theme found in *Gladiator* is that of revenge. Throughout the film, Maximus' character arc revolves around exacting revenge against Commodus for betraying him and arranging the deaths of his wife, his son, and the emperor. Writing in the chapter \"*Gladiator* and Contemporary American Society\" of her book *Big Screen Rome*, Monica S. Cyrino argues that Maximus' revenge arc is driven by the alienation of Roman politics.[102] Cyrino opines that Maximus is introduced as being patriotic and one who \"fights for an ideal Rome because, never having been to the city, he has remained undefiled by the reality that Rome is rightful conqueror and civilizing force over the world.[102] Maximus is soon betrayed by Commodus and \"when he finds his wife and son murdered, it marked the moment of his alienation from everything he once valued.\"[102]\n\n\nThe loss of his family and emperor mentally breaks Maximus, who initially refuses to fight with the other gladiators and eventually cuts out the legion tattoo on his arm. This further solidifies Maximus' alienation from Rome. Cyrino notes that \"Maximus' alienation from a degenerate Rome and his deep-seated ambivalence about his role in restoring Roman government to the people suggests a parallel to post-Cold War America,\" because while there was a \"temporary boost in the rhetoric of national unity and superficial displays of patriotism after September 11, 2001, current political and social commentators remark on the apathy of the American electorate, such as low voter turnout and a persistent lack of interest in political debate.\"[102] When Maximus returns to Rome as a slave, \"he eventually realizes what he has already begun to understand: \"The mob is Rome.\"\"[102] Driven by his anger and isolation, Maximus' resolution is to re-enact his ideal of Rome from within the arena. After killing Commodus, Maximus asks Quintus to reinstate Senator Gracchus in the hope that Gracchus will endeavor to implement Marcus Aurelius' ideals.\n\n\n\n### Violence as spectacle[edit]\n\n\n*Gladiator* comments on the theme of violence in sports and as a spectacle for entertainment. Cyrino writes that \"*Gladiator* evokes the influence of the superstar athlete in a child's wide-eyed worship of celebrity when young Lucius approaches Maximus, his new idol, as he waits in his cell to enter the arena.\"[102] Franzoni himself was inspired by various sports agents and professional sports such as the NFL and WWE when writing the script.[103] Cyrino believes that the film's \"gladiatorial fights are reminiscent of the way in which contemporary sports competitions, especially professional football and wrestling, are filmed for television,\" and that Logan employed a similar tactic in the screenplay for Oliver Stone's *Any Given Sunday* (1999), in which \"the camera watches from a series of vantage points that are easily recognizable to any viewers of Monday Night Football.\"[102] Cyrino argues that the film deconstructs the spectacle of violence through the lens of Maximus. After a victory in Zucchabar, Maximus throws his sword at the local viewing box and spits at the sand after displaying his contempt for the crowd. Cyrino argues that \"the depiction of the Roman mob in Gladiator offers the American audience an unnerving mirror-image of themselves, eager to be entertained at all costs and demanding ever more intricate, dangerous, and realistic spectacles.\"[102]\n\n\n\n### Masculinity and stoicism[edit]\n\n\nThemes of masculinity and stoicism are commentated throughout the film's plot. During the course of the film, Maximus is represented as a strong, fearless figure who is brave, loyal, and honest to those around him. Cyrino writes that Maximus' masculinity is defined through his upbringing as a farmer and a working-class hero.[102] A signature trait of Maximus before he fights is that he picks up dirt from the ground and wipes his hands dirty, signaling his status as a man who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. Cyrino states that Maximus' portrayal as \"a simple man of the soil responds to modern society's idealization of the countryside and its supposed virtue and purity, in stark contrast to the crime-ridden metropolis.\"[102] Maximus gains the support of his fellow gladiators and some of the Senate over the course of the film through the way he behaves and acts.\n\n\nSome philosophers have noted the role stoicism plays in Maximus' masculinity. The real life Marcus Aurelius writes in *Meditations* that stoics must \"concentrate on [their responsibilities] ... without getting stirred up or meeting anger with angers.\" Maximus' drive for vengeance causes him to turn away from his responsibilities of a role model to his son until Lucilla confronts him in his cell, whereby he realizes that his emotions are getting the better of him. When Commodus taunts Maximus about how his son \"squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross,\" stoicism shines a light on Maximus. Instead of giving in to his anger, Maximus slightly bows and refers to Commodus as \"highness\" instead of \"emperor,\" which later becomes a psychological and emotional blow to Commodus' ego. Krysta Larson, writing in \"Mother Knows Best? Evaluating the Roles of Stoic Parents in *Gladiator*,\" believes that \"if it were stoically proper to continue in one's role as a parent to a dead son, then Maximus would fulfill his role as a good Stoic father by pursuing virtuous goals and properly performing the deeds dictated by his roles rather than seeking revenge.\"[104]\n\n\nCommodus, on the other hand, is presented as the antithesis of Maximus. The film portrays Commodus as an immature, cowardly, and unreasonable man who is not fit for the demands of governing the Roman Empire. He openly complains, sobs, has trouble sleeping at night, and struggles to gain respect from the other characters. The film portrays Commodus as having only a single friend in his sister, with even his father openly admitting that his son is not moral. Driven by the lack of love obtained from his father, Commodus is \"keen to acquire the love and respect of the Roman people that his father had enjoyed but criticizes Marcus Aurelius for his intellectualism.\"[102] Cyrino compared Commodus to the presidency of George W. Bush, stating that like Commodus, \"Bush employed rhetoric imbued with overly emotional and sometimes childish tones.\"[102] Both Commodus and Bush, according to Cyrino, are \"contemptuous of guidance from advisory councils and express their scorn by means of anti-intellectual bluster.\"[102]\n\n\nAs it becomes clear Maximus is winning the respect of the crowd, Commodus becomes irritated and frustrated. When he purposefully taunts Maximus about the deaths of his family, Maximus rebukes him by calling him \"highness\" and that his time of honoring his narcissism will come to an end. This leads to him openly complaining and sobbing to Senator Falco later that night. Commodus' amoral personality intensifies when he begins to lust after his own sister and forces her to become his sex slave as punishment for her betrayal. *Gladiator* highlights the distinct personalities of Maximus and Commodus in the final battle. Prior to their duel, Commodus stabs Maximus in an effort to gain the upper hand, demonstrating his cowardly demeanor. Maximus' honor, determination, and discipline eventually overcomes Commodus' vanity, cruelty, and ambition when he stabs him in the neck.\n\n\n\n### Borrowing of Nazi imagery[edit]\n\n\nThe film's depiction of Commodus's entry into Rome borrows imagery from Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda film *Triumph of the Will* (1935), although Scott has pointed out that the iconography of Nazi rallies was itself inspired by the Roman Empire. *Gladiator* reflects back on the film by duplicating similar events that occurred during Adolf Hitler's procession. The Nazi film opens with an aerial view of Hitler arriving in a plane, while Scott shows an aerial view of Rome, quickly followed by a shot of the large crowd of people watching Commodus pass them in a procession with his chariot.[105] The first thing to appear in *Triumph of the Will* is a Nazi eagle, which is alluded to when a statue of an eagle sits atop one of the arches (and then is shortly followed by several more decorative eagles throughout the rest of the scene), leading up to the procession of Commodus. At one point in the Nazi film, a little girl gives flowers to Hitler, while Commodus is met by several girls who all give him bundles of flowers.[106]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Cultural influence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A replica of the mask worn by Maximus in *Gladiator* became the basis for the signature mask for British-American rapper MF Doom.\n*Gladiator* has been considered a cultural phenomenon since its release.[103][107][108] Prior to the release of *Gladiator*, the swords and sandal genre had fallen out of public popularity following a string of expensive box office flops such as *Cleopatra* (1963) and *The Fall of the Roman Empire* (1964).[109] In the 1990s, the historical epic genre saw a revival in popularity following the success of films such as *Dances with Wolves* (1990), *Schindler's List* (1993), *Braveheart* (1995), *Titanic* (1997), and *Saving Private Ryan* (1998).[110][111] *Gladiator* continued these films' realism with more of a focus on Ancient History, which had not been explored extensively since the 1960s.[110]\n\n\nRetrospective reviews and film critics have noted that *Gladiator*'s success spurred a revival of the historical epic genre with films during the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s such as *The Last Samurai* (2003), *Troy* (2004), *The Alamo* (2004), *King Arthur* (2004), *Alexander* (2004), *Kingdom of Heaven* (2005), *300* (2007) and its sequel *300: Rise of an Empire* (2014), *Centurion* (2010), *Robin Hood* (2010), *The Eagle* (2011), *Exodus: Gods and Kings* (2014), *The Last Duel* (2021), *The Northman* (2022), and *Napoleon* (2023).[112] The gladiator arena set piece from *Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones* (2002), which entered production shortly after the release of *Gladiator*, has been compared to the arena setting in the film.[113][114][115]\n\n\nWhile a majority of these films were critically and commercially successful in their own right, *The Guardian*'s Steve Rose argued that the historical epic revival devolved back into parody by 2007, as none of the films have recaptured the impact of *Gladiator*. Rose also argued that after twenty years, the film's story was more relevant now than it was then with its themes of populism and fascism.[116] *Cineramble*'s James Humphreys wrote on the film's twentieth anniversary that the swords and sandal epic revival was short-lived because studios and producers focused more on *Gladiator*'s visuals rather than the quality of its storytelling and characters.[111] Humphreys argued that the film influenced several films in the fantasy and superhero film genres more than the historical epic genre itself, with the film's aesthetics helping influence Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy (2001–2003), the Marvel Cinematic Universe (2008–present), and the DC Extended Universe (2013–2023).[111]\n\n\nThe film's mainstream success was responsible for an increased interest in Roman and classical history in the United States. The Cicero biography *Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician* and Gregory Hays's translation of Marcus Aurelius's *Meditations* received large spikes in sales after the release of the film.[117] According to *The New York Times*, this has been dubbed the \"Gladiator Effect\".\n\n\n\n\n> It's called \"the 'Gladiator' effect\" by writers and publishers. The snob in us likes to believe that it is always books that spin off movies. Yet in this case, it's the movies – most recently *Gladiator* two years ago – that have created the interest in the ancients. And not for more Roman screen colossals, but for writing that is serious or fun or both.[117]\n> \n> \n\n\n*Gladiator'*s effect on culture went beyond cinema. The film influenced numerous television series such as *Rome* (2005–2007) and *Game of Thrones* (2011–2019).[118] Jack Gleeson based his performance of Joffrey Baratheon in *Game of Thrones* on Phoenix's performance as Commodus.[119] British-American underground hip-hop artist MF Doom's signature mask was inspired by the mask worn by Maximus, having picked up one of the replicas that were sold following the film's success[120] Dialogue such as \"Are You Not Entertained,\" \"Am I Not Merciful,\" \"I Will Have My Vengeance,\" and \"Strength and Honor\" are among the most recognizable quotes and have become the subject of numerous internet memes.[121] In 2009, Maximus was featured on a 55c \"Australian Legends\" postage stamp series, with Crowe attending a ceremony to mark the creation of the stamps.[122]\n\n\nThe film became a touchstone for the careers of its cast and crew. After *Thelma & Louise* (1991), Scott faced a string of critical and commercial flops during the 1990s including *1492: Conquest of Paradise* (1992), *White Squall* (1996), and *G.I. Jane* (1997). *Gladiator* became a reversal of fortune for Scott, earning him his best acclaim and interest since *Thelma and Louise*. In the wake of *Gladiator*'s success, Scott followed up by directing *Hannibal* (2001), the highly anticipated sequel to *The Silence of the Lambs* (1991), and *Black Hawk Down* (2001).[123] *Gladiator*, along with *The Insider*, helped elevate Russell Crowe into an established A-lister and worldwide fame. His performance in *Gladiator* landed him top-billing roles in Ron Howard's *A Beautiful Mind* (2001) and Peter Weir's *Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World* (2003).[124]\n\n\n\nScott and Crowe collaborated again for *A Good Year* (2006), *American Gangster* (2007), *Body of Lies* (2008), and *Robin Hood* (2010). *Gladiator* brought fame for Phoenix, who was cast by M. Night Shyamalan for the films *Signs* (2002) and *The Village* (2004) and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as the Joker in *Joker* (2019). Harris' performance in *Gladiator* resulted in his casting as Albus Dumbledore in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (2001).[125] Several members of the cast and crew have commented on the impact the film has had on their careers and its cultural legacy. In a 2020 interview with *Yahoo!*, Möller remarked that he continues to get recognized by many people for his performance as Hagen.[126] Scott considers the film one of the top three favorite films he has directed.[108] Crowe noted that the quality of the film has helped find new fans on television twenty years after its release.[127] When being interviewed by *Den of Geek* in 2020, Wick said this about the film's impact.\n\n\n> I think if you've been around for a while, one of the things you'll learn is that if you look at a hundred years of movies, every cycle repeats, and it's all about someone who will be able to reinvent it. Every 20 years there'll be a vampire movie, and the 20-year-old versions usually start to look kitsch. Luckily with *Gladiator* that's not the case.[107]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Modern reception[edit]\n\n\nToday, *Gladiator* is considered to be one of the greatest action films ever made, one of the greatest historical epic films ever made, and one of the greatest films of both the 2000s decade and 21st Century.\n\n\nOn their *\"*100 Best Movies Of All Time list\"*, Empire* ranked the film as the thirty-ninth best film ever made, and ranked the film as the twenty-second best film of the 21st Century.[128][129] *Gladiator* was named one of the best films of the 21st Century by *The Guardian*, and was included in Rotten Tomatoes \"The 140 Essential 2000 Movies.\"[130][131]\n\n\n*Den of Geek* and *Collider* both named *Gladiator* as the best historical epic ever made, and one of *The Guardian*'s twenty-five best action and war films.[132][133][134] Numerous websites including *Vulture* and /Film named *Gladiator* in the top ten films from Scott.[135][136]\n\n\nThe film is included in the book *1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die*.[137] The American Film Institute included *Gladiator* as one of the four-hundred films nominated for their *AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)* list, while ranking Maximus as the fiftieth greatest hero in film.[138][139] The character of Maximus was placed 12th in the *Total Film* list of 50 best movie heroes and villains[140] and 35th in the *Empire*'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters.[141]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, *Gladiator* has an approval rating of 80% based on 253 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"While not everyone will be entertained by *Gladiator*'s glum revenge story, Russell Crowe thunderously wins the crowd with a star-making turn that provides Ridley Scott's opulent resurrection of Rome a bruised heart.\"[142] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 67 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[143]\n\n\n\n## Sequel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Gladiator 2*\n\nIn June 2001, developments for a *Gladiator* follow-up began in the form of potential for either a prequel or a sequel, with David Franzoni in early negotiations once again to write the script. [144] The following year, a sequel was announced to be moving forward with John Logan serving as screenwriter. The plot, set fifteen years later, included the Praetorian Guards rule of Rome and an older-aged Lucius searching for the truth about his biological father. Franzoni signed on as producer, alongside Douglas Wick and Walter Parkes.[145] In December 2002, the film's plot was announced to include prequel events regarding the parentage of Lucius, as well as sequel events depicting the resurrection of Maximus. Producers and Russell Crowe collaboratively researched extensively, ancient Roman beliefs regarding the afterlife.[146] By September 2003, Scott announced that the script was completed, while confirming that the story would primarily center around the secret son of Maximus, being Lucius.[147]\n\n\nIn May 2006, Scott stated that while development on the project continues, the exact story of the film has yet to be figured out. The filmmaker stated that all the creative minds that were involved with *Gladiator* are working on how to continue from where the story left off. While Crowe favors a fantasy element that would bring Maximus back to life, Scott believes a grounded historical-fiction approach is the better option. Scott confirmed that Lucius will be revealed as the son of Maximus and Lucilla, while stating that the script will be more complex compared to the first movie with the corruption of Rome.[148]\n\n\nDuring this time, Nick Cave was commissioned to write a new draft of the script which he wrote under the working title of \"Christ Killer\". The writer described the plot as a \"deities vs. deity vs. humanity\" story, where the premise involves Maximus being resurrected as an immortal eternal warrior for the Roman gods, after living in purgatory since his death. The story would follow Maximus, who is sent to Earth and tasked with stopping the momentum of Christianity by killing Jesus Christ and His disciples, as their movement was gradually siphoning off the Pagan power and vitality. During this mission, Maximus is tricked into murdering his own son, and cursed to live forever, fighting amongst: the Crusades, WWII, and the Vietnam War. The ending would reveal that in the modern-day, the character now works at The Pentagon. The script was ultimately rejected and scrapped.[149][150][151][152] After experiencing financial difficulties in the 2000s, DreamWorks Pictures was sold to Paramount Pictures in 2006 and any development on the sequel was halted.[153]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Scott stated that his concerns with prior difficulties of developing a script where Maximus is reintroduced after being deceased had been resolved. The filmmaker expressed enthusiasm for the future of the project, while discussions with Russell Crowe to reprise his role were ongoing.[154] In November 2018, it was announced that Paramount was officially green-lighting the development of a sequel, with Scott in early-negotiations to once again serve as director. The project would be a joint-venture production between Paramount, Scott Free Productions, and Parkes/MacDonald Productions with Universal as a co-financing partner.[155]\n\n\nIn June 2019, producers stated that they \"wouldn't touch [*Gladiator*] unless we felt in a way to do it was legitimate\". The script was revealed to take place 25–30 years after the first film.[156] The plot is intended to center around Lucius.[157] In April 2021, Chris Hemsworth approached Crowe with a proposal to become involved with the project. As a fan of the first installment, Hemsworth proposed serving as co-producer in order to see the film realized. While working together on *Thor: Love and Thunder*, the two actors shared additional ideas for where the story for a *Gladiator 2* could go.[158] By September 2021, Scott stated that the script was once again being worked on with his intention being to direct the sequel upon the completion of production on his current project, *Napoleon*.[159]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Paul Mescal was in final talks to star in the upcoming sequel, as Lucius.[160][161][162] Working from a script written by David Scarpa,[7] Scott will produce the film alongside Michael Pruss, Doug Wick and Lucy Fisher. Janty Yates and Arthur Max, the costume designer and production designer, respectively, of the original film are also set to return for the sequel.[162][163] Later that month, Crowe stated that the story will center around Lucius becoming emperor, while stating that he will not be involved in the project.[164] In March 2023, Denzel Washington and Barry Keoghan joined the cast.[165] Joseph Quinn also joined in April while Connie Nielsen was announced to be returning as Lucius' mother. On May 19, 2023, Keoghan has dropped out of the sequel as a result of scheduling conflicts, with Fred Hechinger in talks to replace him. The film is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 22, 2024.[166] [167]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Ancient Rome portal\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* List of films set in ancient Rome\n* Lists of historical films\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Gladiator – Cast, Crew, Director and Awards\". *The New York Times*. 2015.

It stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Tomas Arana, Ralf Möller, Oliver Reed (in his final role), Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, Richard Harris, and Tommy Flanagan. Crowe portrays Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when Commodus, the ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator and rises through the ranks of the arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.\n\n\nInspired by Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 book *Those About to Die* (formerly titled *The Way of the Gladiator*), the script, initially written by Franzoni, was acquired by DreamWorks, and Ridley Scott signed-on to direct the film. Principal photography began in January 1999 and wrapped-up in May of that year, after having experienced a range of problems due to the script being unfinished. Several members of the cast complained about the writing quality throughout the nineteen-week shoot in Fort Ricasoli, Malta, forcing many rewrites. Production complications were further exacerbated when Oliver Reed died of a heart attack before production was finished; British post-production company The Mill, whom oversaw the film's CGI effects, were then tasked with creating a digital body double for the remaining scenes involving his character, Proximo.\n\n\nDespite its troubled production, *Gladiator* was anticipated to be one of the year's most successful films; upon its release, the film grossed over $503 million worldwide, becoming the second highest-grossing film of 2000 (behind *Mission: Impossible 2*). Critics praised the acting—particularly Crowe's and Phoenix's performances—Scott's direction, the visuals, screenplay, action sequences, musical score, and the production values, although its somewhat dark and brooding tone was criticised by some. Earning numerous accolades, *Gladiator* won five Academy Awards at the 73rd Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Crowe. *Gladiator* is known for having revitalized (or established) the careers of its cast and crew, elevating Crowe to leading man status, and turning Phoenix into a celebrity.\n\n\nSince its release, *Gladiator* has been critically reevaluated. It is now widely considered one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the greatest historical epic films ever made. It has been credited with reinventing the sword-and-sandal genre, after waning in the public eye during the 1960s; the film rekindled interest in films centered around the cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and other iconic periods throughout world history. Several films have attempted to emulate *Gladiator*'s visuals, style, and tone with varying degrees of success. The film has been analyzed for its themes of revenge, violence, masculinity, and stoicism. In 2021, Scott announced that writing had begun on a sequel,[8] which is scheduled to be released in the US on November 22, 2024.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 180 AD, Hispano-Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return home after he leads the Roman army to victory against Germanic tribes near Vindobona on the Limes Germanicus. Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus, is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to restore the Roman Republic. Marcus Aurelius informs Commodus; in response, Commodus murders his father.\n\n\nCommodus proclaims himself the new emperor and requests loyalty from Maximus, who refuses. Maximus is arrested by the Praetorian Guard and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and, wounded, rides for his home near Turgalium, where he finds his wife and son crucified. Maximus buries them and collapses from his injuries.  Slavers find him and take him to the city of Zucchabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to gladiator trainer Proximo.\n\n\nMaximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He befriends two other gladiators: Hagen, a German; and Juba, a Numidian. In Rome, Commodus organises 150 days of games to commemorate his father's death. Upon hearing this, Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to \"win the crowd\" to win his freedom.\n\n\nProximo takes his gladiators to Rome to fight in the Colosseum. Disguised in a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the Colosseum as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to reveal his identity; Maximus removes his helmet and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let Maximus and the gladiators live. \n\n\nLucilla, Commodus's sister and Maximus's former lover, visits Maximus in his cell and offers her help, but he refuses. Meanwhile, Commodus arranges a duel between Maximus and Tigris of Gaul, an undefeated gladiator. Several tigers are set upon Maximus during the duel, but he prevails. Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his opponent's life. In response, the crowd chants \"Maximus the Merciful\", which angers Commodus. Increasingly paranoid, Commodus instructs his advisor, Falco, to have every senator followed. \n\n\nMaximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. He meets in secret with Lucilla and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to help Maximus escape Rome to join his legions, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. The Praetorians arrest Gracchus, and Commodus learns of the plot when Lucilla's son, Lucius, innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorians attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed.\n\n\nTo win back public approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus in the lung before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms Commodus during the duel. After the Praetorians refuse to aid him, Commodus unsheathes a hidden knife; Maximus overpowers Commodus and drives the knife into his throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wounds, he asks for political reforms, the freedom of his gladiator allies, and the reinstatement of Senator Gracchus. As he dies, Maximus envisions reuniting with his wife and son in the afterlife. His friends and allies honor him as \"a soldier of Rome\", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena.\n\n\nThat night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nRussell Crowe (left) in 2017 and Joaquin Phoenix in 2018\n\n* Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius: A Hispano-Roman legatus forced into becoming a slave who seeks revenge against Commodus.

Even as I went east, going through Turkey, I began to think to myself this must have been a hell of a franchise.\" During a stop in Baghdad, Iraq, he stopped reading a book about the Irish Revolution for another one: Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 novel *Those About to Die.* These experiences planted the seeds of inspiration for a story about gladiators set in the Roman Empire.\n\n\nTwenty-five years later, Franzoni wrote the screenplay for Steven Spielberg's *Amistad,* which was the director's first film for DreamWorks Pictures. Though *Amistad* was only a moderate commercial success, DreamWorks was impressed with Franzoni's screenplay and gave him a three-picture deal as writer and co-producer. Remembering his 1972 trip, Franzoni pitched his Roman history idea to Spielberg, who immediately told him to write the script.[10]\n\n\nIn the first draft, dated April 4, 1998, Franzoni chose to base his story on Commodus after reading the ancient Roman text *Historia Augusta*. He later named his protagonist Narcissus, a wrestler who, according to the ancient sources Herodian and Cassius Dio, strangled Emperor Commodus to death.[12]\n\n\n\n![Several dead men and various scattered weapons are located in a large arena.

Parkes and Douglas Wick. They showed him a copy of Jean-Léon Gérôme's 1872 painting entitled *Pollice Verso (Thumbs Down)*.[13] Scott was enticed by the idea of filming the world of Ancient Rome. However, he felt Franzoni's dialogue lacked subtlety and hired John Logan to rewrite the script to his liking. Logan rewrote much of the first act and made the decision to kill off Maximus's family to increase the character's desire for revenge.[14]\n\n\nWhile the script was being revised and the production crew was being assembled, DreamWorks began circling several potential partners to help cover the film's budget and costs. Co-financing between studios became increasingly common during the late-1990s as production and marketing costs and the potential for losses spiralled upward.[15] DreamWorks saw success with its split-rights deals as the studio shared financing and distribution for the 1998 films *Saving Private Ryan* and *Deep Impact* with Paramount Pictures. On November 12, 1998, *Variety* reported that Universal Pictures reached a deal with DreamWorks to help finance the film, as well as obtain international distribution rights and split worldwide proceeds 50–50 with DreamWorks, which would distribute the film in North America.[15]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oliver Reed (pictured in 1968) portrayed Proximo.\nWhile writing the script, Franzoni expressed interest in Antonio Banderas as the lead role, but he declined. Mel Gibson, Tom Sizemore, and Tom Cruise were considered for the film, but the producers and studio had Russell Crowe at the top of their list after his breakout performance in *L.A. Confidential* (1997).[16] Crowe was initially hesitant to join the project due to gaining forty pounds for *The Insider* (1999)*,* but director Michael Mann convinced the actor to take the role.[17] He eventually signed on to play the main character in September 1998.[18] Crowe would later state that he was pitched by Parkes with the script still unfinished. In his interview for *Inside the Actors Studio*: \"They said, 'It's a 100-million-dollar film. You're being directed by Ridley Scott. You play a Roman general.' I've always been a big fan of Ridley's.\"[19]\n\n\nJude Law auditioned for the role of Commodus, but Scott landed his number-one choice, Joaquin Phoenix.[20] Jennifer Lopez reportedly lobbied for the role of Lucilla, but lost out to Connie Nielsen.[20] Crowe initially suggested his *Insider* costar Christopher Plummer prior to Richard Harris being cast in the role of Marcus Aurelius. From there, Ralf Möller, Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, and Tommy Flanagan joined the cast as pre-production was ready to commence.\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nIn preparation for filming, Scott spent several months developing storyboards to develop the framework of the plot.[21] Over six weeks, production members scouted various locations within the extent of the Roman Empire before its collapse, including Italy, France, North Africa, and England.[22] All of the film's props, sets, and costumes were manufactured by crew members due to the high costs and unavailability of the items.[23]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\nScott and Franzoni drew on several influences for Gladiator, including *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*, *La Dolce Vita* and *The Conformist*. The film's plot was influenced by two 1960s Hollywood films of the sword-and-sandal genre, *The Fall of the Roman Empire* and *Spartacus*,[24] and shares several plot points with *The Fall of the Roman Empire*, which tells the story of Livius, who, like Maximus in *Gladiator*, is Marcus Aurelius's intended successor. Livius is in love with Lucilla and seeks to marry her while Maximus, who is happily married, was formerly in love with her. Both films portray the death of Marcus Aurelius as an assassination. In *The Fall of the Roman Empire* a group of conspirators independent of Commodus, hoping to profit from Commodus's accession, arrange for Marcus Aurelius to be poisoned. In *Gladiator,* Commodus himself murders his father by smothering him. \n\n\nIn the course of *The Fall of the Roman Empire,* Commodus unsuccessfully seeks to win Livius over to his vision of empire in contrast to that of his father, but continues to employ him notwithstanding; in *Gladiator*, when Commodus fails to secure Maximus's allegiance, he executes Maximus's wife and son and tries unsuccessfully to execute him, too. Livius and Maximus both kill Commodus in single combat for the greater good of Rome in addition to personal motivations: Livius to save Lucilla and Maximus to avenge the murder of his family.\n\n\nScott cited *Spartacus* and *Ben-Hur* as influences on the film: \"These movies were part of my cinema-going youth. But at the dawn of the new millennium, I thought this might be the ideal time to revisit what may have been the most important period of the last two thousand years – if not all recorded history – the apex and beginning of the decline of the greatest military and political power the world has ever known.\"[25]\n\n\n*Spartacus* provides the film's gladiatorial motif, as well as the character of Senator Gracchus, a fictitious senator, bearing the name of a pair of revolutionary tribunes from the 2nd century BC, who in both films is an elder statesman of ancient Rome attempting to preserve the ancient rights of the Roman Senate in the face of an ambitious autocrat – Marcus Licinius Crassus in *Spartacus* and Commodus in *Gladiator.* Both actors who played Gracchus (in *Spartacus* and *Gladiator*) played Claudius in previous films: Charles Laughton of *Spartacus* played Claudius in the unfinished 1937 film *I, Claudius* and Derek Jacobi of *Gladiator* played Claudius in the 1976 BBC adaptation. Both films also share a specific set piece wherein a gladiator (Maximus here, Woody Strode's Draba in *Spartacus*) throws his weapon into a spectator box at the end of a match, as well as at least one line of dialogue: \"Rome is the mob\", said here by Gracchus and by Julius Caesar (John Gavin) in *Spartacus*.\n\n\n\n## Filming[edit]\n\n\n### Principal photography[edit]\n\n\nThe film was shot in three main locations between January and May 1999. The opening battle scenes set in the forests of Germania were shot in three weeks in the Bourne Woods, near Farnham, Surrey, in England.[26] When Scott learned that the Forestry Commission planned to remove a section of the forest, he persuaded them to allow the battle scene to be shot there and burn it down.[27] Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson used multiple cameras filming at various frame rates and a 45-degree shutter,[7] creating stop motion effects in the action sequences, similar to techniques used for the battle sequences of *Saving Private Ryan* (1998).[28]\n\n\nThe scenes of slavery, desert travel, and the gladiatorial training school were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco, just south of the Atlas Mountains over a further three weeks.[29] To construct the arena where Maximus has his first fights, the crew used basic materials and local building techniques to manufacture the 30,000-seat mud brick arena.[30] The scenes set in Rome were shot over a period of nineteen weeks in Fort Ricasoli, Malta.[31][32]\n\n\nIn Malta, a replica of about one-third of Rome's Colosseum was built to a height of 52 feet (16 meters), mostly from plaster and plywood. The other two-thirds and remaining height were added digitally.[33] The replica took several months to build and cost an estimated $1 million.[34] The reverse side of the complex supplied a rich assortment of Ancient Roman street furniture, colonnades, gates, statuary, and marketplaces for other filming requirements. The complex was serviced by tented \"costume villages\" that had to change rooms, storage, armorers, and other facilities.[31] The rest of the Colosseum was created in computer-generated imagery using set-design blueprints and textures referenced from live action, and rendered in three layers to provide lighting flexibility for compositing in Flame and Inferno software.[35]\n\n\nWhile Crowe and Harris became good friends during filming, the actor did not get along with Reed. In a 2010 interview with *GQ*, Crowe stated that he \"never got on with Ollie. He has visited me in dreams and asked me to talk kindly of him. So I should... but we never had a pleasant conversation.\" Crowe was uncomfortable with Reed's excessive drinking during filming. Phoenix was initially anxious about filming and requested Scott he drop out early in production. To help calm the then 25-year-old Phoenix's nerves, Crowe and Harris decided to get him drunk. \"It was actually Richard Harris' idea,\" Crowe later recalled, \"because Joaquin was very nervous on the set and I went to Richard and said, 'Mate, what are we gonna do with this kid, he's asking me to abuse him before takes.'\"[36]\n\n\n\n### Script revisions and complaints[edit]\n\n\nThroughout filmmaking, the actors complained about problems with the script. William Nicholson was brought to Shepperton Studios to make Maximus a more sensitive character. Nicholson reworked Maximus' friendship with Juba and developed the afterlife thread in the film, saying, \"he did not want to see a film about a man who wanted to kill somebody.\"[14] The screenplay faced many rewrites and revisions, with several actors providing changes.[37] Crowe questioned every aspect of the evolving script and strode off the set when he did not get answers. According to Nicholson, Crowe reportedly told him that his \"lines are garbage, but I'm the greatest actor in the world and I can make even garbage sound good.\"\n\n\nAccording to a DreamWorks executive, Crowe \"tried to rewrite the entire script on the spot. You know the big line in the trailer, 'In this life or the next, I will have my vengeance'? At first he absolutely refused to say it.\"[38] Crowe described the script situation: \"I read the script and it was substantially underdone. Even the character didn't exist on the pages. And that set about a long process, that's probably the first time that I've been in a situation where the script wasn't a complete done deal. We actually started shooting with about 32 pages and went through them in the first couple of weeks.\"[19]\n\n\nCrowe threatened to kill Lustig with his bare hands due to him refusing to pay his assistants.[39]\n\n\nOf the writing and filming process, Crowe added, \"Possibly, a lot of the stuff that I have to deal with now in terms of my 'volatility' has to do with that experience. Here was a situation where we got to Morocco with a crew of 200 and a cast of a 100 or whatever, and I didn't have anything to learn. I actually didn't know what the scenes were gonna be. We had, I think, one American writer working on it, one English writer working on it, and of course a group of producers who were also adding their ideas, and then Ridley himself; and then, on the occasion where Ridley would say, 'Look, this is the structure for it– what are you gonna say in that?' So then I'd be doing my own stuff, as well. And this is how things like, 'Strength and honor,' came up. This is how things like, 'At my signal, unleash hell,' came up. The name Maximus Decimus Meridius, it just flowed well.\"[19]\n\n\nMaximus' habit of rubbing soil before each fight references the attachment and affection to his former life as a farmer.[40] In a conversation with Marcus Aurelius, Maximus says the fecund soil of his farm is \"black like my wife's hair\".[40] Crowe wrote the speech himself, drawing on his feelings of homesickness for his own farm.[40]\n\n\n\n### Injuries[edit]\n\n\nCrowe was injured during principal photography. Detailing the impact filming had on his body during his appearance on *Inside the Actor's Studio,* Crowe described that there was a \"lot of blood, lot of blood, lot of grazes, you know, I mean, I've still got, a lot of little scar[s] here and one under here on this elbow, a discoloration of the skin that is directly to Gladiator\".[41] During filming on the sequence where Maximus fights Tigris of Gaul in the arena with tigers, Crowe narrowly escaped being clawed by a tiger.[42]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nMen in white robes with the Colosseum in the background.Several scenes included extensive use of computer-generated imagery shots for views of Rome.\nBritish post-production company The Mill was responsible for much of the computer-generated imagery effects that were added after filming. The company used such tricks as compositing real tigers filmed on bluescreen into the fight sequences, and adding smoke trails and extending the flight paths of the opening scene's salvo of flaming arrows to get around regulations on how far they could be shot during filming. They also used 2,000 live actors to create a computer-generated crowd of 35,000 virtual actors that had to look believable and react to fight scenes.[33] The Mill accomplished this by shooting live actors at different angles giving various performances, and then mapping them onto cards, with motion-capture tools used to track their movements for three-dimensional compositing.[35] The Mill created over 90 visual effects shots, comprising approximately nine minutes of the film's running time.[43]\n\n\nAn unexpected post-production job was required because of the death of Oliver Reed during the filming in Malta before all his scenes had been shot. The Mill created a digital body double for the remaining scenes involving his character Proximo[35] by photographing a live-action body double in the shadows and by performing digital face replacement by mapping a three-dimensional computer-generated image of Reed's face to the remaining scenes during production at an estimated cost of $3.2 million for two minutes of additional footage.[44][45] Visual effects supervisor John Nelson reflected on the decision to include the additional footage: \"What we did was small compared to our other tasks on the film. What Oliver did was much greater. He gave an inspiring, moving performance. All we did was help him finish it.\"[44] The film is dedicated to Reed's memory.[46]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gladiator (2000 soundtrack)\n\n![](image)\n\nHans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard – \"Now We Are Free\"\n\n\nlisten to a clip from the score of *Gladiator*.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nThe Oscar-nominated score was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, and conducted by Gavin Greenaway. Zimmer was originally planning to use Israeli vocalist Ofra Haza for the score, after his work with her in *The Prince of Egypt*. However, Haza died in late February 2000, before she was able to record, and so Gerrard was chosen instead. Lisa Gerrard's vocals are similar to her own work on *The Insider* score.[47]\n\n\nThe music for many of the battle scenes has been noted as similar to Gustav Holst's \"Mars: The Bringer of War\", and in June 2006, the Holst Foundation sued Hans Zimmer for allegedly copying the late Holst's work.[48][49] The case was settled out of court. [50] Another close musical resemblance occurs in the scene of Commodus's triumphal entry into Rome, accompanied by music clearly evocative of two sections – the Prelude to *Das Rheingold* and Siegfried's Funeral March from *Götterdämmerung* – from Richard Wagner's *Ring of the Nibelung*.\n\n\nOn February 27, 2001, nearly a year after the first soundtrack's release, Decca produced *Gladiator: More Music From the Motion Picture*. Then, on September 5, 2005, Decca produced *Gladiator: Special Anniversary Edition*, a two-CD pack containing both the above-mentioned releases. Some of the music from the film was featured in the NFL playoffs in January 2003 before commercial breaks and before and after half-time.[51] In 2003, Luciano Pavarotti released a recording of himself singing a song from the film and said he regretted turning down an offer to perform on the soundtrack.[52]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Context[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2000 in film\n\n![](image)The logo for *Gladiator*\nThe theatrical year of 1999 achieved a record $7.3 billion at the domestic box office, thanks largely to the success of *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace* and *The Sixth Sense*. Industry executives did not replicate that success with the releases in 2000, however. Increasing production costs and a lack of merchandising forced studios to concentrate marketing on the appeal of popular actors such as Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson, Eddie Murphy, Jim Carrey, and Bruce Willis to help boost ticket sales and draw in potential female audiences for their slates.[53][54][55]\n\n\nThe action sequel *Mission: Impossible 2* was expected to have the biggest success, while anticipated films such as *Dinosaur*, *Gladiator*, *The Patriot*, and *X-Men* were also expected to perform well.[53][56][57] Films such as *Battlefield Earth*, *Gone in 60 Seconds*, *The Kid*, *Me, Myself & Irene*, *Nutty Professor II: The Klumps*, *The Perfect Storm*, and *What Lies Beneath* were heavily marketed and promoted with the appeal of their leading actors that already had a built-in audience.[54][55] *Gladiator* was expected to perform well following test screenings that DreamWorks conducted between October 1999 and February 2000 that were overwhelmingly positive, but some analysts predicted the film could be impacted by the lack of a built-in audience for Crowe.[58][59][60]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Gladiator* was released in the United States and Canada on May 5, 2000.[61] During its opening weekend, *Gladiator* earned $34.8 million across 2,938 theaters—an average of $11,851 per theater—making it the number one film of the weekend, ahead of *U-571* ($7.8 million), in its first weekend, and *The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas* ($7.6 million), in its second weekend.[62][63] The film not only leapt over *Scream 3* to achieve the year's highest opening weekend, but also earned the third-highest opening weekend for an R-rated film ever, trailing only *Air Force One* (1997) and *Interview with the Vampire* (1994).[64] The film's positive word of mouth and the sex appeal of Crowe helped with bringing in a female audience during its opening weekend, with the percentage of women buying tickets increasing from 35% on its opening day to 45% the following day.[65]\n\n\nThe film remained number one in its second weekend with $24.6 million, ahead of the debut of *Battlefield Earth* ($11.5 million).[66] During its third weekend, *Gladiator* fell to second place with $19.7 million, behind the debut of *Dinosaur* ($38.5 million).[67][68] By Memorial Day, it had already earned a total of $127.2 million, surpassing *Erin Brockovich* to become the highest-grossing film of the year.[69] Without regaining the number one spot, *Gladiator* spent ten weeks in the top ten at the box office. The film was in theaters for over a year and finished its theatrical run on May 10, 2001.[70] *Gladiator* grossed $187.7 million in the United States and Canada, finishing as the fourth highest-grossing film of 2000 behind *Mission: Impossible 2* ($215.4 million), *Cast Away* ($233.6 million), and *How The Grinch Stole Christmas* ($260 million).[71]\n\n\nOutside of North America, *Gladiator* is estimated to have grossed over $272.9 million internationally.[70] This gave the film a cumulative gross of over $503.2 million worldwide against a budget of $103 million.[70] It was the second highest-grossing film of 2000 behind *Mission: Impossible 2* ($546.4 million).[70]\n\n\nDue to an increase in ticket prices, 2000 set a new record of $7.7 billion at the domestic box office, exceeding the previous year's $7.31 billion. However, attendance was estimated at being down 2.5% from 1999.[72][73] Industry executives blamed the decrease in attendance on the year's slate for its lack of commercial appeal, a dearth of female-driven films and sleeper hits, as well as several exhibition chains filing for bankruptcy.[74][73] Nevertheless, *Gladiator* was considered to be one of 2000's biggest blockbusters due to strong word of mouth, contributing to its long-lasting box office performance and DreamWorks' improving fortunes.[75][73][74]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nUpon its initial release, *Gladiator* opened to generally positive reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\n\n![](image)Connie Nielsen (pictured here in 2009) was praised by critics, notably the otherwise critical Ebert, for providing depth to the film.\nThe performances and the cast were praised by critics, with Crowe and Phoenix being considered by critics as the main highlights. Kirk Honeycutt of *The Hollywood Reporter* said Crowe \"solidly anchors this epic-scale gladiator movie - the first in nearly four decades - by using his burly frame and expressive face to give dimension to what might otherwise have been comic book heroics.\"[76] In his positive review for *The Wall Street Journal*, Joe Morgensten said that Crowe \"doesn't use tricks in this role to court our approval. He earns it the old-fashioned way, by daring to be quiet, if not silent, and intensely, implacably strong,\" and that the film \"rests on Mr. Crowe's armor-clad shoulders, and he carries it remarkably well.\"[77] *Empire*'s Ian Nathan, giving the film four stars, wrote that Phoenix displayed \"gleeful hamminess\" in his performance.[78]\n\n\nWriting about the film as a whole, Nathan expressed that \"while it's all grand opera, and driven by sweeping gestures and pompous, overwritten dialogue, it is prone to plain silliness - especially in granting us the big showdown at the close. But the sheer dynamism of the action, coupled with Hans Zimmer's lavish score and the forcefield of Crowe, still makes this a fiercesome competitor in the summer movie stakes.\"[78] Geoff Andrew of *Time Out* praised the film, saying that \"the cast is strong (notably Nielsen as Commodus's vacillating sister, and the late Oliver Reed, unusually endearing as a gladiator owner), the pacing lively, and the sets, swordplay and Scud catapults impressive.[79] Roger Ebert, who was otherwise critical in his two-star review, praised Nielsen for having the most depth in the entire film.[80] On the other hand, Camille Paglia, who called the film \"boring, badly shot and suffused with sentimental p.c. rubbish,\" criticized Crowe and Phoenix's performances[81]\n\n\nScott's directing was generally praised by critics, who called it a return to form for the director. In her A- review for *Entertainment Weekly*, Lisa Schwarzbaum praised Scott's directing, particularly during the opening battle sequence. Schwarzbaum writes that with the battle sequence, \"Scott lets loose his own extraordinary assault. It's a bravura sequence of flaming arrows, falling horses, and mortal combat that doesn't copy *Private Ryan's* famous opening tour de force of carnage so much as raise a banner in admiration. It's Scott the visual artist at his most deluxe.\" Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* wrote that \"Scott really scores in his big Rome set-pieces, especially Crowe's combat with men and tigers in a computer-enhanced Colosseum much bigger and more monumental than the original,\" and that \"for all of its implausible silliness and towering high camp, Scott's movie tells an engaging story, and the central arena fight-sequence in which Maximus and his gladiators playing the doomed Carthaginians end up defeating the Romans and reversing history \"to the emperor's horror\" is wittily and adroitly done: a sly demonstration of the confluence of politics and mass entertainment.\"[82] Michael Wilmington of *The Chicago Tribune* gave praise to Scott's direction, comparing the visual style of the film to that of Scott's 1982 film *Blade Runner*.[83]\n\n\nCritics generally praised the production values of the film, with the costumes, production design, and visual effects. Todd McCarthy, praising the film for *Variety*, said *Gladiator* \"revels in both the glory and the horror that were Rome,\" with \"details in Arthur Max's brilliant production design and Janty Yates' highly diversified costume design that offered up in wonderfully offhand fashion,\" while also commanding the \"CGI effects that have allowed numerous sets, notably the Colosseum, to be enhanced in size and spectacle value; the stunts, fights and battles are as forceful and realistic as anyone could want, John Mathieson's widescreen cinematography is magnificent, and the pacing across 2½ hours is well modulated.\" Ebert criticized the film for looking \"muddy, fuzzy and indistinct.\" In his two-star review, Ebert also derided the writing, saying it \"employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.\"[80]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by Gladiator\n\nDespite the critical and commercial success it received during its theatrical run, *Gladiator* was not initially considered a major contender for the Academy Awards. When award season talk came around towards the end of 2000, critics and journalists simply viewed the film as an enjoyable summer film, but not a major Oscar contender.[84][85] *Gladiator* and *Erin Brockovich* were singled out for their releases during the first half of the year, while contenders such as *Almost Famous*, *Billy Elliot*, *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and Traffic* were released during the fall and winter of 2000 and received awards from numerous critics groups and guild organizations.[85] When the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama at the 58th Golden Globes, media outlets began viewing *Gladiator* as the front runner for the Academy Awards.[86] Its subsequent wins for the BAFTA Award for Best Film and Produces Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture solidified *Gladiator*'s front runner status for the Oscars.[87]\n\n\nWhen nominations for the 73rd Academy Awards were announced on February 13, 2001, *Gladiator* received the most nominations with twelve, while *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* had scored ten. On March 25, 2001, the film won five Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor for Russell Crowe, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Costume Design. It was nominated for an additional seven: Best Original Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor for Joaquin Phoenix and Best Director for Ridley Scott, Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Film Editing.[88]\n\n\nIt was the first film to win Best Picture without winning either a directing or screenwriting award since *All the King's Men* at the 22nd Academy Awards in 1950. This was also the second consecutive DreamWorks film to achieve an Oscar for Best Picture after *American Beauty* the previous year.[89] Due to Academy rules, only Hans Zimmer was officially nominated for Best Original Score, and not Lisa Gerrard.[90] However, the pair did win the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score as co-composers.[91] Of its one-hundred and nineteen award nominations, *Gladiator* won a total of forty-eight prizes.[92]\n\n\n\n## Post-release[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

As Ridley Scott wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous film, he hired several historians as advisors. Some deviations from historical facts were made to increase interest, maintain narrative continuity, and for practical or safety reasons. Scott stated that due to the influence of previous films affecting the public perception of what ancient Rome was like, some historical facts were \"too unbelievable\" to include. For instance, in an early version of the script, gladiators would have been carrying out product endorsements in the arena. While this would have been historically accurate, it was not filmed for fear that audiences would think it anachronistic. \n\n\nAt least one historical advisor resigned due to these changes. Another asked not to be mentioned in the credits, though it was stated in the director's commentary that he constantly asked, \"where is the proof that certain things were exactly like they say?\" Historian Allen Ward of the University of Connecticut believed that historical accuracy would not have made *Gladiator* less interesting or exciting, stating, \"creative artists need to be granted some poetic license, but that should not be a permit for the wholesale disregard of facts in historical fiction\".\n\n\n\n### Fictionalization[edit]\n\n\nMarcus Aurelius was not murdered by his son Commodus. He died at Vindobona (modern Vienna) in 180 AD from the Antonine Plague. The epidemic, believed to be either smallpox or measles, swept across the Roman Empire during his reign. There is no indication Marcus Aurelius wished to return the Empire to a republican form of government, as depicted in the film. Moreover, he shared the rule of the Empire with Commodus for three years before his own death. Commodus then ruled alone from that point until his death at the end of 192 AD. The film depicts Marcus as defeating the barbarians in the Marcomannic Wars. In reality, the war was still ongoing when Aurelius died. Commodus secured a peace treaty with the two Germanic tribes allied against Rome, the Marcomanni and the Quadi, immediately after his father's death.\n\n\nAlthough Commodus did engage in show combat in the Colosseum, he was not killed in the arena. He was strangled in his bath by the wrestler Narcissus. Commodus reigned for over twelve years, unlike the shorter period portrayed in the film. In the film, Lucilla is portrayed as a lone widow of Lucius Verus with one son, also named Lucius Verus. While Lucilla was the widow of Verus and also had a son by that name, their son died young, long before the reign of Commodus. \n\n\nLucilla remarried Claudius Pompeianus soon after Verus' death. She had been married to him for 11 years by the time her brother became Emperor. Her only living son during this time was Aurelius Pompeianus. The film omits Lucilla's other two children with Verus, Lucilla Plautia and Aurelia Lucilla. Lucilla was implicated in a plot to assassinate her brother in 182 AD, along with her stepson by Pompeianus and several others. She was first exiled to the island of Capri by her brother, then executed on his orders later in the year.\n\n\nThe character of Maximus is fictional, although in some respects he resembles the following historical figures: Narcissus, Commodus's real-life murderer and the character's name in the first draft of the screenplay; Spartacus, who led a significant slave revolt in 73–71 BC; Cincinnatus (519–430 BC), a farmer who was made dictator, saved Rome from invasion, then resigned his six-month appointment after 15 days; and Marcus Nonius Macrinus, a trusted general, consul in 154 AD, and friend of Marcus Aurelius. \n\n\nMaximus had a similar career, and personality traits as documented by Herodian, to Claudius Pompeianus, a Syrian who married Marcus Aurelius' daughter Lucilla following the death of Lucius Verus. It is believed Aurelius may have wanted Pompeianus to succeed him as caesar, in preference to Commodus, but was turned down. Pompeianus had no part in any of the many plots against Commodus. He was not depicted in the film.\n\n\nIn the film, the character Antonius Proximo claims \"the wise\" Marcus Aurelius banned gladiatorial games in Rome, forcing him to move to Mauretania. The real Aurelius banned games, but only in Antioch as punishment for the city's support of the usurper Avidius Cassius. No games were ever banned in Rome. However, when the Emperor started conscripting gladiators into the legions, the resulting shortage in fighters allowed *lanistae* such as Proximo to make \"windfall\" profits through increased charges for their services.\n\n\nIn real life, the death of Commodus did not result in peace for Rome, nor a return to the Roman Republic. Rather, it ushered in a chaotic and bloody power struggle that culminated in the Year of the Five Emperors of AD 193. According to Herodian, the people of Rome were overjoyed at the news of Commodus dying, although they feared that the praetorians would not accept the new emperor Pertinax.\n\n\n\"Maximus Decimus Meridius\" does not appear to be a usual personal name during ancient Rome. A more accurate name would be \"Decimus Meridius Maximus\", as \"Decimus\" is a *praenomen* and \"Maximus\" is a *cognomen*. \"Proximo\" should be rendered as \"Proximus.\"\n\n\n\n### Anachronisms[edit]\n\n\n![Reconstructed Roman artillery pieces are used to locate the most likely position of Roman artillery during the battle at the Harzhorn by firing marked projectiles into the historical impact zones.](image)Roman field artillery used in open battle was far more compact and transportable than shown by the film. It was capable of creating \"killing zones\" with a low chance of survival, as proven by tightly spaced impacts on a real battlefield.\nCostumes in the film are rarely historically correct. Some soldiers wear fantasy helmets. The bands wrapped around their lower arms were rarely worn. Their appearance is the product of a cinematic stereotype where historical films depict peoples of antiquity wearing such bands. Although the film is set within the 2nd century AD, the Imperial Gallic armor and the helmets worn by the legionaries are from AD 75, a century earlier. This was superseded by new designs in AD 100. The legions' standard bearers (aquiliferi), centurions, mounted forces, and auxiliaries would have worn scale armour, lorica squamata. The Germanic tribes are dressed in clothes from the Stone Age period.\n\n\nRoman field artillery was used in combat extensively by the Romans, though within the film they are also depicted as using  onagers, which was not used by the Roman Empire until the 4th century, hundreds of years after the events of the film. The Roman cavalry are shown using stirrups. This is anachronistic in that the horse-mounted forces of the Roman army used a two-horned saddle, without stirrups. Stirrups were only employed in filming for safety reasons because of the additional training and skill required to ride with a Roman saddle.\n\n\nCatapults and ballistae would not have been used in a forest. They were reserved primarily for sieges and rarely used in open battles. Fire pots fired from catapults were not used in ancient history.\n\n\nThe Praetorian Guards all wear purple uniforms, no historical evidence supports this. On campaign, they usually wore standard legionary equipment with some unique decorative elements.\n\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Gladiator* was first released on DVD and VHS on November 21, 2000.[93] Along with *X-Men*, both films generated $60 million in home video sales each in their first week.[94] By this point, *Gladiator* had already sold 1.8 million DVD units, making it the fastest-selling DVD release at the time.[95] By January 2001, it broke *The Matrix*'s record for becoming the top-selling DVD release, selling 3.5 million copies.[96] In the United Kingdom, 500,000 copies were sold in 2000 alone.[97] With over 5 million copies sold, the film held the record for being the best-selling DVD title of all time until *Shrek* surpassed it later that year.[98]\n\n\nThe DVD has since been released in several different extended and special edition versions. Special features for the Blu-ray Disc and DVDs include deleted scenes, trailers, documentaries, commentaries, storyboards, image galleries, Easter eggs, and cast auditions. The film was released on Blu-ray in September 2009, in a 2-disc edition containing both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film, as part of Paramount's \"Sapphire Series\".[99] Initial reviews of the Blu-ray Disc release criticized poor image quality, leading many to call for it to be remastered, as Sony did with *The Fifth Element* in 2007.[100] A remastered version was later released in 2010.\n\n\nThe DVD editions that have been released since the original two-disc version, include a film-only single-disc edition as well as a three-disc \"extended edition\" DVD which was released in August 2005. The extended edition DVD features approximately fifteen minutes of additional scenes, most of which appear in the previous release as deleted scenes. The original cut, which Scott still calls his director's cut, is also selectable via seamless branching, which is not included on the UK edition. The DVD is notable for having a new commentary track featuring director Scott and star Crowe. The film is on the first disc, the second one has a three-hour documentary into the making of the film by DVD producer Charles de Lauzirika, and the third disc contains supplements. Discs one and two of the three-disc extended edition were repackaged and sold as a two-disc \"special edition\" in the EU in 2005. \n\n\nThe film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray by Paramount Home Media Distribution in May 2018.[101]\n\n\n\n## Thematic analysis[edit]\n\n\n### Revenge[edit]\n\n\nA common theme found in *Gladiator* is that of revenge. Throughout the film, Maximus' character arc revolves around exacting revenge against Commodus for betraying him and arranging the deaths of his wife, his son, and the emperor. Writing in the chapter \"*Gladiator* and Contemporary American Society\" of her book *Big Screen Rome*, Monica S. Cyrino argues that Maximus' revenge arc is driven by the alienation of Roman politics.[102] Cyrino opines that Maximus is introduced as being patriotic and one who \"fights for an ideal Rome because, never having been to the city, he has remained undefiled by the reality that Rome is rightful conqueror and civilizing force over the world.[102] Maximus is soon betrayed by Commodus and \"when he finds his wife and son murdered, it marked the moment of his alienation from everything he once valued.\"[102]\n\n\nThe loss of his family and emperor mentally breaks Maximus, who initially refuses to fight with the other gladiators and eventually cuts out the legion tattoo on his arm. This further solidifies Maximus' alienation from Rome. Cyrino notes that \"Maximus' alienation from a degenerate Rome and his deep-seated ambivalence about his role in restoring Roman government to the people suggests a parallel to post-Cold War America,\" because while there was a \"temporary boost in the rhetoric of national unity and superficial displays of patriotism after September 11, 2001, current political and social commentators remark on the apathy of the American electorate, such as low voter turnout and a persistent lack of interest in political debate.\"[102] When Maximus returns to Rome as a slave, \"he eventually realizes what he has already begun to understand: \"The mob is Rome.\"\"[102] Driven by his anger and isolation, Maximus' resolution is to re-enact his ideal of Rome from within the arena. After killing Commodus, Maximus asks Quintus to reinstate Senator Gracchus in the hope that Gracchus will endeavor to implement Marcus Aurelius' ideals.\n\n\n\n### Violence as spectacle[edit]\n\n\n*Gladiator* comments on the theme of violence in sports and as a spectacle for entertainment. Cyrino writes that \"*Gladiator* evokes the influence of the superstar athlete in a child's wide-eyed worship of celebrity when young Lucius approaches Maximus, his new idol, as he waits in his cell to enter the arena.\"[102] Franzoni himself was inspired by various sports agents and professional sports such as the NFL and WWE when writing the script.[103] Cyrino believes that the film's \"gladiatorial fights are reminiscent of the way in which contemporary sports competitions, especially professional football and wrestling, are filmed for television,\" and that Logan employed a similar tactic in the screenplay for Oliver Stone's *Any Given Sunday* (1999), in which \"the camera watches from a series of vantage points that are easily recognizable to any viewers of Monday Night Football.\"[102] Cyrino argues that the film deconstructs the spectacle of violence through the lens of Maximus. After a victory in Zucchabar, Maximus throws his sword at the local viewing box and spits at the sand after displaying his contempt for the crowd. Cyrino argues that \"the depiction of the Roman mob in Gladiator offers the American audience an unnerving mirror-image of themselves, eager to be entertained at all costs and demanding ever more intricate, dangerous, and realistic spectacles.\"[102]\n\n\n\n### Masculinity and stoicism[edit]\n\n\nThemes of masculinity and stoicism are commentated throughout the film's plot. During the course of the film, Maximus is represented as a strong, fearless figure who is brave, loyal, and honest to those around him. Cyrino writes that Maximus' masculinity is defined through his upbringing as a farmer and a working-class hero.[102] A signature trait of Maximus before he fights is that he picks up dirt from the ground and wipes his hands dirty, signaling his status as a man who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. Cyrino states that Maximus' portrayal as \"a simple man of the soil responds to modern society's idealization of the countryside and its supposed virtue and purity, in stark contrast to the crime-ridden metropolis.\"[102] Maximus gains the support of his fellow gladiators and some of the Senate over the course of the film through the way he behaves and acts.\n\n\nSome philosophers have noted the role stoicism plays in Maximus' masculinity. The real life Marcus Aurelius writes in *Meditations* that stoics must \"concentrate on [their responsibilities] ... without getting stirred up or meeting anger with angers.\" Maximus' drive for vengeance causes him to turn away from his responsibilities of a role model to his son until Lucilla confronts him in his cell, whereby he realizes that his emotions are getting the better of him. When Commodus taunts Maximus about how his son \"squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross,\" stoicism shines a light on Maximus. Instead of giving in to his anger, Maximus slightly bows and refers to Commodus as \"highness\" instead of \"emperor,\" which later becomes a psychological and emotional blow to Commodus' ego. Krysta Larson, writing in \"Mother Knows Best? Evaluating the Roles of Stoic Parents in *Gladiator*,\" believes that \"if it were stoically proper to continue in one's role as a parent to a dead son, then Maximus would fulfill his role as a good Stoic father by pursuing virtuous goals and properly performing the deeds dictated by his roles rather than seeking revenge.\"[104]\n\n\nCommodus, on the other hand, is presented as the antithesis of Maximus. The film portrays Commodus as an immature, cowardly, and unreasonable man who is not fit for the demands of governing the Roman Empire. He openly complains, sobs, has trouble sleeping at night, and struggles to gain respect from the other characters. The film portrays Commodus as having only a single friend in his sister, with even his father openly admitting that his son is not moral. Driven by the lack of love obtained from his father, Commodus is \"keen to acquire the love and respect of the Roman people that his father had enjoyed but criticizes Marcus Aurelius for his intellectualism.\"[102] Cyrino compared Commodus to the presidency of George W. Bush, stating that like Commodus, \"Bush employed rhetoric imbued with overly emotional and sometimes childish tones.\"[102] Both Commodus and Bush, according to Cyrino, are \"contemptuous of guidance from advisory councils and express their scorn by means of anti-intellectual bluster.\"[102]\n\n\nAs it becomes clear Maximus is winning the respect of the crowd, Commodus becomes irritated and frustrated. When he purposefully taunts Maximus about the deaths of his family, Maximus rebukes him by calling him \"highness\" and that his time of honoring his narcissism will come to an end. This leads to him openly complaining and sobbing to Senator Falco later that night. Commodus' amoral personality intensifies when he begins to lust after his own sister and forces her to become his sex slave as punishment for her betrayal. *Gladiator* highlights the distinct personalities of Maximus and Commodus in the final battle. Prior to their duel, Commodus stabs Maximus in an effort to gain the upper hand, demonstrating his cowardly demeanor. Maximus' honor, determination, and discipline eventually overcomes Commodus' vanity, cruelty, and ambition when he stabs him in the neck.\n\n\n\n### Borrowing of Nazi imagery[edit]\n\n\nThe film's depiction of Commodus's entry into Rome borrows imagery from Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda film *Triumph of the Will* (1935), although Scott has pointed out that the iconography of Nazi rallies was itself inspired by the Roman Empire. *Gladiator* reflects back on the film by duplicating similar events that occurred during Adolf Hitler's procession. The Nazi film opens with an aerial view of Hitler arriving in a plane, while Scott shows an aerial view of Rome, quickly followed by a shot of the large crowd of people watching Commodus pass them in a procession with his chariot.[105] The first thing to appear in *Triumph of the Will* is a Nazi eagle, which is alluded to when a statue of an eagle sits atop one of the arches (and then is shortly followed by several more decorative eagles throughout the rest of the scene), leading up to the procession of Commodus. At one point in the Nazi film, a little girl gives flowers to Hitler, while Commodus is met by several girls who all give him bundles of flowers.[106]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Cultural influence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A replica of the mask worn by Maximus in *Gladiator* became the basis for the signature mask for British-American rapper MF Doom.\n*Gladiator* has been considered a cultural phenomenon since its release.[103][107][108] Prior to the release of *Gladiator*, the swords and sandal genre had fallen out of public popularity following a string of expensive box office flops such as *Cleopatra* (1963) and *The Fall of the Roman Empire* (1964).[109] In the 1990s, the historical epic genre saw a revival in popularity following the success of films such as *Dances with Wolves* (1990), *Schindler's List* (1993), *Braveheart* (1995), *Titanic* (1997), and *Saving Private Ryan* (1998).[110][111] *Gladiator* continued these films' realism with more of a focus on Ancient History, which had not been explored extensively since the 1960s.[110]\n\n\nRetrospective reviews and film critics have noted that *Gladiator*'s success spurred a revival of the historical epic genre with films during the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s such as *The Last Samurai* (2003), *Troy* (2004), *The Alamo* (2004), *King Arthur* (2004), *Alexander* (2004), *Kingdom of Heaven* (2005), *300* (2007) and its sequel *300: Rise of an Empire* (2014), *Centurion* (2010), *Robin Hood* (2010), *The Eagle* (2011), *Exodus: Gods and Kings* (2014), *The Last Duel* (2021), *The Northman* (2022), and *Napoleon* (2023).[112] The gladiator arena set piece from *Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones* (2002), which entered production shortly after the release of *Gladiator*, has been compared to the arena setting in the film.[113][114][115]\n\n\nWhile a majority of these films were critically and commercially successful in their own right, *The Guardian*'s Steve Rose argued that the historical epic revival devolved back into parody by 2007, as none of the films have recaptured the impact of *Gladiator*. Rose also argued that after twenty years, the film's story was more relevant now than it was then with its themes of populism and fascism.[116] *Cineramble*'s James Humphreys wrote on the film's twentieth anniversary that the swords and sandal epic revival was short-lived because studios and producers focused more on *Gladiator*'s visuals rather than the quality of its storytelling and characters.[111] Humphreys argued that the film influenced several films in the fantasy and superhero film genres more than the historical epic genre itself, with the film's aesthetics helping influence Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy (2001–2003), the Marvel Cinematic Universe (2008–present), and the DC Extended Universe (2013–2023).[111]\n\n\nThe film's mainstream success was responsible for an increased interest in Roman and classical history in the United States. The Cicero biography *Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician* and Gregory Hays's translation of Marcus Aurelius's *Meditations* received large spikes in sales after the release of the film.[117] According to *The New York Times*, this has been dubbed the \"Gladiator Effect\".\n\n\n\n\n> It's called \"the 'Gladiator' effect\" by writers and publishers. The snob in us likes to believe that it is always books that spin off movies. Yet in this case, it's the movies – most recently *Gladiator* two years ago – that have created the interest in the ancients. And not for more Roman screen colossals, but for writing that is serious or fun or both.[117]\n> \n> \n\n\n*Gladiator'*s effect on culture went beyond cinema. The film influenced numerous television series such as *Rome* (2005–2007) and *Game of Thrones* (2011–2019).[118] Jack Gleeson based his performance of Joffrey Baratheon in *Game of Thrones* on Phoenix's performance as Commodus.[119] British-American underground hip-hop artist MF Doom's signature mask was inspired by the mask worn by Maximus, having picked up one of the replicas that were sold following the film's success[120] Dialogue such as \"Are You Not Entertained,\" \"Am I Not Merciful,\" \"I Will Have My Vengeance,\" and \"Strength and Honor\" are among the most recognizable quotes and have become the subject of numerous internet memes.[121] In 2009, Maximus was featured on a 55c \"Australian Legends\" postage stamp series, with Crowe attending a ceremony to mark the creation of the stamps.[122]\n\n\nThe film became a touchstone for the careers of its cast and crew. After *Thelma & Louise* (1991), Scott faced a string of critical and commercial flops during the 1990s including *1492: Conquest of Paradise* (1992), *White Squall* (1996), and *G.I. Jane* (1997). *Gladiator* became a reversal of fortune for Scott, earning him his best acclaim and interest since *Thelma and Louise*. In the wake of *Gladiator*'s success, Scott followed up by directing *Hannibal* (2001), the highly anticipated sequel to *The Silence of the Lambs* (1991), and *Black Hawk Down* (2001).[123] *Gladiator*, along with *The Insider*, helped elevate Russell Crowe into an established A-lister and worldwide fame. His performance in *Gladiator* landed him top-billing roles in Ron Howard's *A Beautiful Mind* (2001) and Peter Weir's *Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World* (2003).[124]\n\n\n\nScott and Crowe collaborated again for *A Good Year* (2006), *American Gangster* (2007), *Body of Lies* (2008), and *Robin Hood* (2010). *Gladiator* brought fame for Phoenix, who was cast by M. Night Shyamalan for the films *Signs* (2002) and *The Village* (2004) and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as the Joker in *Joker* (2019). Harris' performance in *Gladiator* resulted in his casting as Albus Dumbledore in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (2001).[125] Several members of the cast and crew have commented on the impact the film has had on their careers and its cultural legacy. In a 2020 interview with *Yahoo!*, Möller remarked that he continues to get recognized by many people for his performance as Hagen.[126] Scott considers the film one of the top three favorite films he has directed.[108] Crowe noted that the quality of the film has helped find new fans on television twenty years after its release.[127] When being interviewed by *Den of Geek* in 2020, Wick said this about the film's impact.\n\n\n> I think if you've been around for a while, one of the things you'll learn is that if you look at a hundred years of movies, every cycle repeats, and it's all about someone who will be able to reinvent it. Every 20 years there'll be a vampire movie, and the 20-year-old versions usually start to look kitsch. Luckily with *Gladiator* that's not the case.[107]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Modern reception[edit]\n\n\nToday, *Gladiator* is considered to be one of the greatest action films ever made, one of the greatest historical epic films ever made, and one of the greatest films of both the 2000s decade and 21st Century.\n\n\nOn their *\"*100 Best Movies Of All Time list\"*, Empire* ranked the film as the thirty-ninth best film ever made, and ranked the film as the twenty-second best film of the 21st Century.[128][129] *Gladiator* was named one of the best films of the 21st Century by *The Guardian*, and was included in Rotten Tomatoes \"The 140 Essential 2000 Movies.\"[130][131]\n\n\n*Den of Geek* and *Collider* both named *Gladiator* as the best historical epic ever made, and one of *The Guardian*'s twenty-five best action and war films.[132][133][134] Numerous websites including *Vulture* and /Film named *Gladiator* in the top ten films from Scott.[135][136]\n\n\nThe film is included in the book *1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die*.[137] The American Film Institute included *Gladiator* as one of the four-hundred films nominated for their *AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)* list, while ranking Maximus as the fiftieth greatest hero in film.[138][139] The character of Maximus was placed 12th in the *Total Film* list of 50 best movie heroes and villains[140] and 35th in the *Empire*'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters.[141]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, *Gladiator* has an approval rating of 80% based on 253 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"While not everyone will be entertained by *Gladiator*'s glum revenge story, Russell Crowe thunderously wins the crowd with a star-making turn that provides Ridley Scott's opulent resurrection of Rome a bruised heart.\"[142] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 67 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[143]\n\n\n\n## Sequel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Gladiator 2*\n\nIn June 2001, developments for a *Gladiator* follow-up began in the form of potential for either a prequel or a sequel, with David Franzoni in early negotiations once again to write the script. [144] The following year, a sequel was announced to be moving forward with John Logan serving as screenwriter. The plot, set fifteen years later, included the Praetorian Guards rule of Rome and an older-aged Lucius searching for the truth about his biological father. Franzoni signed on as producer, alongside Douglas Wick and Walter Parkes.[145] In December 2002, the film's plot was announced to include prequel events regarding the parentage of Lucius, as well as sequel events depicting the resurrection of Maximus. Producers and Russell Crowe collaboratively researched extensively, ancient Roman beliefs regarding the afterlife.[146] By September 2003, Scott announced that the script was completed, while confirming that the story would primarily center around the secret son of Maximus, being Lucius.[147]\n\n\nIn May 2006, Scott stated that while development on the project continues, the exact story of the film has yet to be figured out. The filmmaker stated that all the creative minds that were involved with *Gladiator* are working on how to continue from where the story left off. While Crowe favors a fantasy element that would bring Maximus back to life, Scott believes a grounded historical-fiction approach is the better option. Scott confirmed that Lucius will be revealed as the son of Maximus and Lucilla, while stating that the script will be more complex compared to the first movie with the corruption of Rome.[148]\n\n\nDuring this time, Nick Cave was commissioned to write a new draft of the script which he wrote under the working title of \"Christ Killer\". The writer described the plot as a \"deities vs. deity vs. humanity\" story, where the premise involves Maximus being resurrected as an immortal eternal warrior for the Roman gods, after living in purgatory since his death. The story would follow Maximus, who is sent to Earth and tasked with stopping the momentum of Christianity by killing Jesus Christ and His disciples, as their movement was gradually siphoning off the Pagan power and vitality. During this mission, Maximus is tricked into murdering his own son, and cursed to live forever, fighting amongst: the Crusades, WWII, and the Vietnam War. The ending would reveal that in the modern-day, the character now works at The Pentagon. The script was ultimately rejected and scrapped.[149][150][151][152] After experiencing financial difficulties in the 2000s, DreamWorks Pictures was sold to Paramount Pictures in 2006 and any development on the sequel was halted.[153]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Scott stated that his concerns with prior difficulties of developing a script where Maximus is reintroduced after being deceased had been resolved. The filmmaker expressed enthusiasm for the future of the project, while discussions with Russell Crowe to reprise his role were ongoing.[154] In November 2018, it was announced that Paramount was officially green-lighting the development of a sequel, with Scott in early-negotiations to once again serve as director. The project would be a joint-venture production between Paramount, Scott Free Productions, and Parkes/MacDonald Productions with Universal as a co-financing partner.[155]\n\n\nIn June 2019, producers stated that they \"wouldn't touch [*Gladiator*] unless we felt in a way to do it was legitimate\". The script was revealed to take place 25–30 years after the first film.[156] The plot is intended to center around Lucius.[157] In April 2021, Chris Hemsworth approached Crowe with a proposal to become involved with the project. As a fan of the first installment, Hemsworth proposed serving as co-producer in order to see the film realized. While working together on *Thor: Love and Thunder*, the two actors shared additional ideas for where the story for a *Gladiator 2* could go.[158] By September 2021, Scott stated that the script was once again being worked on with his intention being to direct the sequel upon the completion of production on his current project, *Napoleon*.[159]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Paul Mescal was in final talks to star in the upcoming sequel, as Lucius.[160][161][162] Working from a script written by David Scarpa,[7] Scott will produce the film alongside Michael Pruss, Doug Wick and Lucy Fisher. Janty Yates and Arthur Max, the costume designer and production designer, respectively, of the original film are also set to return for the sequel.[162][163] Later that month, Crowe stated that the story will center around Lucius becoming emperor, while stating that he will not be involved in the project.[164] In March 2023, Denzel Washington and Barry Keoghan joined the cast.[165] Joseph Quinn also joined in April while Connie Nielsen was announced to be returning as Lucius' mother. On May 19, 2023, Keoghan has dropped out of the sequel as a result of scheduling conflicts, with Fred Hechinger in talks to replace him. The film is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 22, 2024.[166] [167]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Ancient Rome portal\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* List of films set in ancient Rome\n* Lists of historical films\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Gladiator – Cast, Crew, Director and Awards\". *The New York Times*. 2015.

A self-described \"passion piece\" for Haggis, the film features racial and social tensions in Los Angeles and was inspired by a real-life incident in which Haggis's Porsche was carjacked in 1991 outside a video store on Wilshire Boulevard.[3] The film features an ensemble cast, including Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle (who also worked as a producer on the film), Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, William Fichtner, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Thandiwe Newton, Michael Peña, Larenz Tate and Ryan Phillippe.\n\n\n*Crash* premiered at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2004, before it was released in theaters on May 6, 2005, by Lions Gate Films. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction and performances (particularly Dillon's) but criticized the portrayal of race relations as simplistic and unsubtle. The film was a success at the box office, earning $98.4 million worldwide against its $6.5 million budget.\n\n\nThe film earned several accolades and nominations. Dillon received nominations for Best Supporting Actor from the Academy Awards, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild. Additionally, the cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The film received six Academy Award nominations and controversially won three for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Film Editing at the 78th Academy Awards. It was also nominated for nine BAFTA Awards and won two, for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Newton.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn Los Angeles, Detective Graham Waters and his partner Ria are involved in a minor collision with a car being driven by Kim Lee. Ria and Kim Lee exchange racially charged insults. Waters later arrives at a crime scene, where the body of an unnamed dead child has been discovered. The film then backtracks 48 hours to trace the preceding chain of events.\n\n\nAnthony and Peter, two young Black men, carjack district attorney Rick Cabot and his wife Jean. As the men drive away in the SUV, Peter puts a figurine of St. Christopher, the patron saint of travelers, on the dashboard. They pass by Waters and Ria, who are investigating a homicide in a San Fernando Valley parking lot. The pair learn that a White undercover cop, Detective Conklin, shot a Black undercover cop, Detective Lewis, with neither knowing the other was a policeman.\n\n\nAt home, Cabot rails that the carjacking incident could cost him re-election, because no matter whom he sides with, he will lose either the black vote or the law and order vote. Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz overhears Jean, who suspects that Daniel is a gangster, demanding that the locks be changed again.\n\n\nWhile searching for the Cabots' stolen vehicle, Sergeant John Ryan pulls over an SUV driven by a wealthy Black couple, TV director Cameron Thayer and his wife, Christine. Though Ryan knows the vehicle is not the one he's searching for, he accosts the couple on his claim he saw Christine performing fellatio on Cameron while he was driving. During the traffic stop, Ryan performs a body search on Christine and molests her in front of Cameron. Ryan's younger partner, Officer Tom Hansen, looks on in horror but does not intervene.\n\n\nHansen goes to his superior Lieutenant Dixon to report Ryan's conduct and requests a transfer. Dixon, a Black man, tells Hansen that a racism complaint would hurt his own career and allows the transfer on the condition that Ryan's conduct not be mentioned. Ryan is shown living with his ill father, who cannot get health insurance. On the phone, Ryan takes out his frustrations on the Black HMO administrator he speaks with. When the insurance adjuster does not respond quickly enough, Ryan insults her competency by saying that more qualified White men didn't get her job because of affirmative action.\n\n\nIn the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit a man of Asian descent while passing a parked van. They take the injured man's body and leave him in front of a hospital. Meanwhile, Waters, who is in a relationship with Ria, gets into an argument with her when he makes a casual remark about Mexico being her country of origin. Ria angrily reminds him that her father is actually from Puerto Rico and her mother is from El Salvador. Waters later visits his mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother.\n\n\nRyan later comes across a car crash and an overturned vehicle. In his attempt to rescue the passenger, Ryan sees it is Christine, who recognizes the officer from their earlier incident and frantically resists his assistance. Ryan manages to pull her out of the car just before it is engulfed by a fireball. As Christine is being helped by paramedics, she stares at Ryan, her molester.\n\n\nWaters is summoned to a meeting with DA worker Flanagan, who tells Waters that Internal Affairs wants Conklin imprisoned. Waters has evidence that Lewis was possibly involved in a drug deal, but Flanagan promises Waters a job as Cabot's chief investigator, as well as the clearing of his brother's criminal record, in exchange for his cooperation. At a press conference, Waters reluctantly confirms the homicide was racially motivated.\n\n\nAnthony and Peter carjack another Navigator, which happens to belong to Cameron. Cameron fights back and Peter flees the scene before a police car approaches. Cameron and Anthony drive away and a police chase ensues, with Hansen as one of the pursuing officers. When police catch the SUV, Hansen recognizes Cameron, and out of remorse for the earlier traffic stop, he vouches for Cameron to be let off with a warning. Anthony, who was hiding during the exchange, is dropped off at a bus stop by Cameron.\n\n\nLater that night as Hansen is off the clock, he picks up a hitchhiking Peter. During the drive, Peter reaches into his pocket and Hansen, thinking he is reaching for a gun, shoots him. Peter collapses dead, revealing he was only reaching for his Saint Christopher statuette. Hansen hides the body in some bushes and burns his car. Waters and Ria later arrive at the scene, and it is revealed that the dead body is Waters's brother Peter. Waters's mother disowns him over Peter's death.\n\n\nAnthony comes across the white van from earlier with its keys still in the ignition. He steals the van and takes it to a chop shop, where it is discovered there are Cambodian immigrants chained in the back. The van had belonged to Kim Lee and her husband (the man Anthony and Peter accidentally hit), meaning they were involved in human trafficking.

It was quickly purchased by Lions Gate Films for $3.5 million.[7][10] *Crash* had a wide release on May 6, 2005, and was a box office success in the late spring of 2005.[13]\n\n\nThe film grossed $53.4 million domestically, making back more than seven times its estimated $6.5 million-budget.[1] Despite its success in relation to its cost, *Crash* was the lowest-grossing film at the domestic box office to win Best Picture since *The Last Emperor* in 1987.[14]\n\n\n\n## Critical response and legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Initial[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 242 reviews, with an average score of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A raw and unsettling morality piece on modern angst and urban disconnect, *Crash* examines the dangers of bigotry and xenophobia in the lives of interconnected Angelenos.\"[15] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 66 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[16] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[17]\n\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and described it as \"a movie of intense fascination\",[18] listing it as the best film of 2005.[19] Ebert concluded his review with the sentiment \"not many films have the possibility of making their audiences better people. I don't expect *Crash* to work any miracles, but I believe anyone seeing it is likely to be moved to have a little more sympathy for people not like themselves.\"[18] Steve Davis of the *Austin Chronicle* called it the \"most compelling American movie to come around in a long time\" and said it succeeds in inviting audiences to make preconceived notions about the characters and then complicates those notions.[20] Ella Taylor of *LA Weekly* described it as \"not just one of the best Hollywood movies about race, but along with *Collateral*, one of the finest portrayals of contemporary LA life period.\"[21]\n\n\nThe performances of Dillon, Cheadle, Bridges, Peña, and Howard were singled out.[22][23][24][25] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* wrote, \"Specific scenes, especially those involving Dillon as the racially resentful cop who, like everyone else, has his reasons, bristle with tension as the character continuously pushes past conventional limits in abusing his authority and, redeemingly, in his display of uncommon valor.\"[26][20] Peter Bradshaw of the *Guardian* gave the film three out of five stars, writing, \"*Crash* is a very watchable and well-constructed piece of work...but its daringly supercharged fantasies of racial paranoia and humanist redemption are not to be taken too seriously.\"[27] Joanne Kaufman of the *Wall Street Journal* opined, \"Ultimately, *Crash* succeeds in spite of itself,\" noting that at a certain point, it \"starts to feel obvious and schematic\" but remains \"a complex blend of compassion and sorrow\".[28]\n\n\nThe film's plot elements, such as the means through which all the characters are connected, were derided by critics as contrived and unconvincing.[29][30][23][31] Ty Burr of the *Boston Globe* wrote that the film \"is one of those multi-character, something-is-rotten-in-Los Angeles barnburners that grab you by the lapels and try desperately to shake you up. It's more artful than *Grand Canyon*, less artsy than *Magnolia* (LA gets dusted with snow instead of frogs), and much less of a mess than *Falling Down*.\"[24] Burr lamented how \"its characters come straight from the assembly line of screenwriting archetypes, and too often they act in ways that archetypes, rather than human beings, do. You can feel its creator shuttling them here and there on the grid of greater LA, pausing portentously between each move.\"[24]\n\n\nAnother criticism centered on the storytelling as didactic and heavy-handed. Writing for *Slate*, David Edelstein commented *Crash* \"might even have been a landmark film about race relations had its aura of blunt realism not been dispelled by a toxic cloud of dramaturgical pixie dust.\"[32] Others noted how the film had nothing new or insightful to say on racism, with Stephanie Zacharek of *Salon* writing that *Crash* \"only confirms what we already know about racism: It's inside every one of us. That should be a starting point, not a startling revelation.\"[33][34] A.O. Scott of the *New York Times* described it as \"a frustrating movie: full of heart and devoid of life; crudely manipulative when it tries hardest to be subtle; and profoundly complacent in spite of its intention to unsettle and disturb.\"[35]\n\n\nMuch criticism focused on how the film presents racism and its origins, with many noting its depiction of race relations as too simplistic and tidy. The redemption arcs of the white characters, particularly Sergeant Ryan, drew controversy for their execution.[36][37][26] Many opined that Ryan's redemption by way of his heroic rescue of Christine felt unearned.[37][36][38][32][25] Others pointed out the implausibility of Jean Cabot softening her racist attitudes because of an ankle sprain and the care of her Latina housemaid.[37] Clarisse Loughrey of the *Independent* wrote, \"By presenting racism as nothing more than a personality issue in need of a fix, *Crash* absolves its white audience of any sense of collective responsibility.\"[36]\n\n\n\n### Retrospective[edit]\n\n\nIn the years since the film's release, criticism and debate about the film have grown alongside ongoing cultural dialogues about race and social movements in the United States.[39][40] In 2009, cultural critic Ta-Nehisi Coates criticized the film as shallow and \"unthinking\", naming *Crash* \"the worst film of the decade\".[41] The film has been described as using multicultural and sentimentalist imagery to cover over material and \"historically sedimented inequalities\" that continue to affect various racial groups in Los Angeles.[42]\n\n\nIn a retrospective review, Tim Grierson of *The New Republic* opined, \"Haggis has characters hurl nasty epithets at one another, as if that's the most corrosive aspect of discrimination, failing to acknowledge that what's most destructive aren't the shouts but, rather, the whispers—the private jokes and long-held prejudices shared by likeminded people behind closed doors and far from public view.\"[43] The film was also criticized for depicting the Persian shopkeeper as a \"deranged, paranoid individual who is only redeemed by what he believes is a mystical act of God\".[44]\n\n\nThe film ranks at #460 in *Empire*'s 2008 poll of the \"500 Greatest Films of All Time\".[45]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Independent Film & Television Alliance selected *Crash* as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years.[46]\n\n\n\n### Top ten lists[edit]\n\n\n*Crash* was listed on many critics' top ten lists.[47]\n\n\n\n* 1st – Roger Ebert, *Chicago Sun-Times*\n* 1st – Steve Davis, *Austin Chronicle*\n* 3rd – Kevin Thomas, *Los Angeles Times*\n* 3rd – Richard Roeper, *Ebert & Roeper*[48]\n* 3rd – Ella Taylor, *L.A. Weekly*\n* 4th – Stephen Hunter, *The Washington Post*\n* 6th – Christy Lemire, Associated Press[49]\n* 7th – Claudia Puig, *USA Today*\n* 8th – Richard Schickel, *Time*\n* 8th – Lisa Schwarzbaum, *Entertainment Weekly*\n* 9th – Peter Travers, *Rolling Stone*\n\n### Oscar controversy[edit]\n\n\nAt the 78th Academy Awards, *Crash* won the Oscar for Best Picture, triumphing over the heavily favored *Brokeback Mountain* in what is considered as one of the most notable Oscars upsets.[50][51] After announcing the award, presenter Jack Nicholson was caught on camera mouthing the word \"whoa\" out of apparent surprise at the result.[52] The film's use of moral quandary as a storytelling medium was widely reported as ironic since many saw it as the \"safe\" alternative to *Brokeback Mountain*, which is about a gay relationship (the other nominees, *Good Night and Good Luck*, *Capote*, and *Munich* also tackle heavy subjects of McCarthyism, homosexuality, and terrorism).[53] Critic Kenneth Turan suggested that *Crash* benefited from homophobia among Academy members,[54][55] some of whom openly voiced their discomfort with *Brokeback Mountain* due to its subject matter.[56][57][58] After the Oscars telecast, critic Roger Ebert insisted in his column that the better film won the award.[59][60]\n\n\n*Film Comment* magazine placed *Crash* first on its list of \"Worst Winners of Best Picture Oscars\", followed by *Slumdog Millionaire* at #2 and *Chicago* at #3.[61] Similarly, a 2014 survey of film critics by *The Atlantic* identified the film's victory as among the most glaring mistakes made by the Academy Awards.[62] In 2017, David Ehrlich and Eric Kohn of *IndieWire* ranked *Crash* as the worst on its list of \"Best Picture Winners of the 21st Century, Ranked from Worst to Best\".[63]\n\n\nIn 2015, *The Hollywood Reporter* polled hundreds of Academy members, asking them to re-vote on past controversial decisions. For the 2005 Best Picture winner, *Brokeback Mountain* beat *Crash* and the other nominees.[64][65]\n\n\nIn a 2015 interview, Haggis commented, \"Was [*Crash*] the best film of the year? I don't think so. There were great films that year. *Good Night, and Good Luck* – amazing film. *Capote* – terrific film. Ang Lee's *Brokeback Mountain*, great film. And Spielberg's *Munich*. I mean please, what a year. *Crash*, for some reason, affected people, it touched people. And you can't judge these films like that. I'm very glad to have those Oscars. They're lovely things. But you shouldn't ask me what the best film of the year was because I wouldn't be voting for *Crash*, only because I saw the artistry that was in the other films. Now however, for some reason that's the film that touched people the most that year. So I guess that's what they voted for, something that really touched them. And I'm very proud of the fact that *Crash* does touch you. People still come up to me more than any of my films and say: 'That film just changed my life.' I've heard that dozens and dozens and dozens of times. So it did its job there. I mean, I knew it was the social experiment that I wanted, so I think it's a really good social experiment. Is it a great film? I don't know.\"[66][67]\n\n\nIn a 2020 retrospective about the film and its Oscars win, K. Austin Collins of *Vanity Fair* wrote the film \"is a throwback to a familiar strain of Oscar-friendly, liberal message movie—in which the 'message,' often, is that people are complicated, goodness is relative, and evil is not a terminal condition. It dramatizes racism the same way that classical Hollywood storytelling has long dramatized things: through a sense of character and intention and a guise of psychological realism, through arcs and archetypes, through a slow climb toward third-act revelations about who people really are as evinced by the things they've achieved, the changes they've undergone by film's end.\"[39]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Crash* (2004 film)\n\n*Crash* received several awards and nominations, and was named one of the top ten films of the year by both the American Film Institute[68] and the National Board of Review.[69] The film was nominated for six awards at the 78th Academy Awards and won three, for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Film Editing.[70] It was also nominated for nine British Academy Film Awards and won two, for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Newton.[71] Dillon received nominations for best supporting actor at the Academy Awards,[70] British Academy Film Awards,[71] Golden Globe Awards,[72] and Screen Actors Guild Awards[73] for his performance. Additionally, the cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture,[74] and Harris and Moresco won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay.[75]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Crash (soundtrack)\nThe original score was released by Superb Records through Lionsgate Films in 2005.[76][77] All songs were written and composed by Mark Isham, except where noted.[76] The iTunes release is the complete score released through Yari Music Group, and has the cues isolated and in film order (unlike the commercial score CD which is edited, incomplete, in a different order, and in suite form).[78] A second volume of tracks, titled *Crash: Music from and Inspired by the Film,* was released featuring songs that appear in the film.[79][80]\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Crash* was released on DVD on September 6, 2005, in widescreen and fullscreen one-disc versions.[81] Bonus features included a music video by KansasCali (now known as the Rocturnals) for the song \"If I...\" from the soundtrack. The director's cut of the film was released in a two-disc special edition DVD on April 4, 2006, with more bonus content than the one-disc set. The director's cut is three minutes longer than the theatrical cut. The scene where Daniel is talking with his daughter under her bed is extended and a new scene is added with officer Hansen in the police station locker room.[82]\n\n\n*Crash* was the first Best Picture winner to be released on Blu-ray Disc in the US, on June 27, 2006.[83]\n\n\n\n## Television series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Crash* (2008 TV series)\n\nA 13-episode series premiered on the Starz network on October 17, 2008. The series features Dennis Hopper as a record producer in Los Angeles, California, and how his life is connected to other characters in the city, including a police officer (Ross McCall) and his partner, actress-turned-police officer, Arlene Tur. The cast consists of a Brentwood mother (Clare Carey), her real-estate developer husband (D. B. Sweeney), a former gang member-turned-EMT (Brian Tee), a street-smart driver (Jocko Sims), an undocumented Guatemalan immigrant (Luis Chavez), and a detective (Nick Tarabay).[84]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Greater Los Angeles portal\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* *Grand Canyon* (1991 film)\n* *Magnolia* (1999 film)\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Crash (2005)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

A self-described \"passion piece\" for Haggis, the film features racial and social tensions in Los Angeles and was inspired by a real-life incident in which Haggis's Porsche was carjacked in 1991 outside a video store on Wilshire Boulevard.[3] The film features an ensemble cast, including Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle (who also worked as a producer on the film), Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, William Fichtner, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Thandiwe Newton, Michael Peña, Larenz Tate and Ryan Phillippe.\n\n\n*Crash* premiered at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2004, before it was released in theaters on May 6, 2005, by Lions Gate Films. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction and performances (particularly Dillon's) but criticized the portrayal of race relations as simplistic and unsubtle. The film was a success at the box office, earning $98.4 million worldwide against its $6.5 million budget.\n\n\nThe film earned several accolades and nominations. Dillon received nominations for Best Supporting Actor from the Academy Awards, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild. Additionally, the cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The film received six Academy Award nominations and controversially won three for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Film Editing at the 78th Academy Awards. It was also nominated for nine BAFTA Awards and won two, for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Newton.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn Los Angeles, Detective Graham Waters and his partner Ria are involved in a minor collision with a car being driven by Kim Lee. Ria and Kim Lee exchange racially charged insults. Waters later arrives at a crime scene, where the body of an unnamed dead child has been discovered. The film then backtracks 48 hours to trace the preceding chain of events.\n\n\nAnthony and Peter, two young Black men, carjack district attorney Rick Cabot and his wife Jean. As the men drive away in the SUV, Peter puts a figurine of St. Christopher, the patron saint of travelers, on the dashboard. They pass by Waters and Ria, who are investigating a homicide in a San Fernando Valley parking lot. The pair learn that a White undercover cop, Detective Conklin, shot a Black undercover cop, Detective Lewis, with neither knowing the other was a policeman.\n\n\nAt home, Cabot rails that the carjacking incident could cost him re-election, because no matter whom he sides with, he will lose either the black vote or the law and order vote. Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz overhears Jean, who suspects that Daniel is a gangster, demanding that the locks be changed again.\n\n\nWhile searching for the Cabots' stolen vehicle, Sergeant John Ryan pulls over an SUV driven by a wealthy Black couple, TV director Cameron Thayer and his wife, Christine. Though Ryan knows the vehicle is not the one he's searching for, he accosts the couple on his claim he saw Christine performing fellatio on Cameron while he was driving. During the traffic stop, Ryan performs a body search on Christine and molests her in front of Cameron. Ryan's younger partner, Officer Tom Hansen, looks on in horror but does not intervene.\n\n\nHansen goes to his superior Lieutenant Dixon to report Ryan's conduct and requests a transfer. Dixon, a Black man, tells Hansen that a racism complaint would hurt his own career and allows the transfer on the condition that Ryan's conduct not be mentioned. Ryan is shown living with his ill father, who cannot get health insurance. On the phone, Ryan takes out his frustrations on the Black HMO administrator he speaks with. When the insurance adjuster does not respond quickly enough, Ryan insults her competency by saying that more qualified White men didn't get her job because of affirmative action.\n\n\nIn the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit a man of Asian descent while passing a parked van. They take the injured man's body and leave him in front of a hospital. Meanwhile, Waters, who is in a relationship with Ria, gets into an argument with her when he makes a casual remark about Mexico being her country of origin. Ria angrily reminds him that her father is actually from Puerto Rico and her mother is from El Salvador. Waters later visits his mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother.\n\n\nRyan later comes across a car crash and an overturned vehicle. In his attempt to rescue the passenger, Ryan sees it is Christine, who recognizes the officer from their earlier incident and frantically resists his assistance. Ryan manages to pull her out of the car just before it is engulfed by a fireball. As Christine is being helped by paramedics, she stares at Ryan, her molester.\n\n\nWaters is summoned to a meeting with DA worker Flanagan, who tells Waters that Internal Affairs wants Conklin imprisoned. Waters has evidence that Lewis was possibly involved in a drug deal, but Flanagan promises Waters a job as Cabot's chief investigator, as well as the clearing of his brother's criminal record, in exchange for his cooperation. At a press conference, Waters reluctantly confirms the homicide was racially motivated.\n\n\nAnthony and Peter carjack another Navigator, which happens to belong to Cameron. Cameron fights back and Peter flees the scene before a police car approaches. Cameron and Anthony drive away and a police chase ensues, with Hansen as one of the pursuing officers. When police catch the SUV, Hansen recognizes Cameron, and out of remorse for the earlier traffic stop, he vouches for Cameron to be let off with a warning. Anthony, who was hiding during the exchange, is dropped off at a bus stop by Cameron.\n\n\nLater that night as Hansen is off the clock, he picks up a hitchhiking Peter. During the drive, Peter reaches into his pocket and Hansen, thinking he is reaching for a gun, shoots him. Peter collapses dead, revealing he was only reaching for his Saint Christopher statuette. Hansen hides the body in some bushes and burns his car. Waters and Ria later arrive at the scene, and it is revealed that the dead body is Waters's brother Peter. Waters's mother disowns him over Peter's death.\n\n\nAnthony comes across the white van from earlier with its keys still in the ignition. He steals the van and takes it to a chop shop, where it is discovered there are Cambodian immigrants chained in the back. The van had belonged to Kim Lee and her husband (the man Anthony and Peter accidentally hit), meaning they were involved in human trafficking. The chop shop owner offers Anthony $500 per immigrant, but Anthony refuses. After driving the Cambodians to Chinatown and freeing them, he passes by a fender-bender. One driver turns out to be the insurance adjuster Ryan had previously argued with, and the other is an Asian man. An exchange of racially charged insults erupts between the drivers.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Sandra Bullock as Jean Cabot, Rick's wife\n* Don Cheadle as Detective Graham Waters, a black officer investigating recent murders based on racial tensions\n* Matt Dillon as Sergeant John Ryan, a bigoted police officer\n* Jennifer Esposito as Ria, Graham's Hispanic partner\n* Brendan Fraser as District Attorney Rick Cabot, Jean's husband\n* Terrence Howard as Cameron Thayer, a television director and Christine's husband\n* Ludacris as Anthony, a violent carjacker and Peter's partner\n* Thandiwe Newton (credited as Thandie Newton) as Christine Thayer, Cameron's wife\n* Michael Peña as Daniel Ruiz, a Hispanic locksmith\n* Ryan Phillippe as Officer Tom Hansen, a rookie policeman and Ryan's partner\n* Larenz Tate as Peter, a laid back carjacker, and Anthony's partner\n* Shaun Toub as Farhad, a Persian shop owner\n* Bahar Soomekh as Dorri, Farhad's daughter\n* Ashlyn Sanchez as Lara Ruiz, Daniel's daughter\n* Karina Arroyave as Elizabeth Ruiz, Daniel's wife\n* Loretta Devine as Shaniqua Johnson, a HMO administrator\n* Beverly Todd as Mrs. Waters\n* William Fichtner as Jake Flanagan, Rick's campaign manager\n* Keith David as Lieutenant Dixon, Tom's superior officer\n* Jack McGee as Gun Store Owner\n* Greg Joung Paik as Choi Chin Gui, a human trafficker\n* Alexis Rhee as Kim Lee, Choi Chin Gui's wife\n* Daniel Dae Kim as Park\n* Nona Gaye as Karen\n* Bruce Kirby as \"Pop\" Ryan\n* Tony Danza as Fred\n* Kathleen York as Officer Johnson\n* Sylva Kelegian as Nurse Hodges\n* Marina Sirtis as Shereen, Farhad's wife\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nWriter and director Paul Haggis was inspired to make the film after being carjacked by two African-American men at a Blockbuster Video on Wilshire Boulevard while driving home from the premiere of *The Silence of the Lambs* in February 1991.[4][5] Afterwards he began thinking more about the impact of race, ethnicity, and class in American society.[6][7] He later stated that he wrote *Crash* not simply to criticize racists but to \"bust liberals\" for the idea that the United States had become a post-racial society.[8] Haggis cowrote the first draft of *Crash* with Robert Moresco in 2001 after being fired from *Family Law*.[9][4]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nHaggis initially tried to sell the script to television producers before it gained the attention of producers Cathy Schulman and Bob Yari.[9] Yari offered Haggis $7.5 million to produce the script as a film, on the condition he could assemble an ensemble cast of major stars.[9] Don Cheadle was the first actor to be cast and also came on board as a producer, which helped attract other big names to the production.[10][4] Forest Whitaker was originally attached to play Terrence Howard's role but dropped out.[9] The casting of Brendan Fraser as the district attorney, which came last, was pivotal in getting the film green-lit.[9]\n\n\nHeath Ledger and John Cusack were also attached to the roles of Tom Hanson and John Ryan, respectively, but dropped out after production delays.[9] At one point, Don Cheadle also considered leaving the production to perform in *Hotel Rwanda*.[7] According to Yari, the departure of Ledger from the cast reduced the film's international value and the budget was brought down by $1 million.[9]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nFilming began in Los Angeles for a 32-day shoot in December 2003.[9] Haggis made up for the reduced budget by taking out three mortgages on his house, cutting back on exterior shots, and reusing locations.[9] Principal cast members also agreed to pay cuts and deferred their salaries.[11] Production was delayed for a week when Haggis suffered from cardiac arrest while filming a scene, although he defied medical advice to hire a new director.[7][9][4]\n\n\nIn a 2020 interview with *Vulture*, Thandiwe Newton stated that Haggis ensured she was wearing special protective underwear for the police sexual assault scene, because he wanted it to look \"real\" from the camera's perspective for Matt Dillon \"to go there\".[12]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nAfter a rough cut was shown at 2004 Toronto International Film Festival, the film premiered at the Elgin Theatre in Toronto in September 2004. It was quickly purchased by Lions Gate Films for $3.5 million.[7][10] *Crash* had a wide release on May 6, 2005, and was a box office success in the late spring of 2005.[13]\n\n\nThe film grossed $53.4 million domestically, making back more than seven times its estimated $6.5 million-budget.[1] Despite its success in relation to its cost, *Crash* was the lowest-grossing film at the domestic box office to win Best Picture since *The Last Emperor* in 1987.[14]\n\n\n\n## Critical response and legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Initial[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 242 reviews, with an average score of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A raw and unsettling morality piece on modern angst and urban disconnect, *Crash* examines the dangers of bigotry and xenophobia in the lives of interconnected Angelenos.\"[15] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 66 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[16] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[17]\n\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and described it as \"a movie of intense fascination\",[18] listing it as the best film of 2005.[19] Ebert concluded his review with the sentiment \"not many films have the possibility of making their audiences better people. I don't expect *Crash* to work any miracles, but I believe anyone seeing it is likely to be moved to have a little more sympathy for people not like themselves.\"[18] Steve Davis of the *Austin Chronicle* called it the \"most compelling American movie to come around in a long time\" and said it succeeds in inviting audiences to make preconceived notions about the characters and then complicates those notions.[20] Ella Taylor of *LA Weekly* described it as \"not just one of the best Hollywood movies about race, but along with *Collateral*, one of the finest portrayals of contemporary LA life period.\"[21]\n\n\nThe performances of Dillon, Cheadle, Bridges, Peña, and Howard were singled out.[22][23][24][25] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* wrote, \"Specific scenes, especially those involving Dillon as the racially resentful cop who, like everyone else, has his reasons, bristle with tension as the character continuously pushes past conventional limits in abusing his authority and, redeemingly, in his display of uncommon valor.\"[26][20] Peter Bradshaw of the *Guardian* gave the film three out of five stars, writing, \"*Crash* is a very watchable and well-constructed piece of work...but its daringly supercharged fantasies of racial paranoia and humanist redemption are not to be taken too seriously.\"[27] Joanne Kaufman of the *Wall Street Journal* opined, \"Ultimately, *Crash* succeeds in spite of itself,\" noting that at a certain point, it \"starts to feel obvious and schematic\" but remains \"a complex blend of compassion and sorrow\".[28]\n\n\nThe film's plot elements, such as the means through which all the characters are connected, were derided by critics as contrived and unconvincing.[29][30][23][31] Ty Burr of the *Boston Globe* wrote that the film \"is one of those multi-character, something-is-rotten-in-Los Angeles barnburners that grab you by the lapels and try desperately to shake you up. It's more artful than *Grand Canyon*, less artsy than *Magnolia* (LA gets dusted with snow instead of frogs), and much less of a mess than *Falling Down*.\"[24] Burr lamented how \"its characters come straight from the assembly line of screenwriting archetypes, and too often they act in ways that archetypes, rather than human beings, do. You can feel its creator shuttling them here and there on the grid of greater LA, pausing portentously between each move.\"[24]\n\n\nAnother criticism centered on the storytelling as didactic and heavy-handed. Writing for *Slate*, David Edelstein commented *Crash* \"might even have been a landmark film about race relations had its aura of blunt realism not been dispelled by a toxic cloud of dramaturgical pixie dust.\"[32] Others noted how the film had nothing new or insightful to say on racism, with Stephanie Zacharek of *Salon* writing that *Crash* \"only confirms what we already know about racism: It's inside every one of us. That should be a starting point, not a startling revelation.\"[33][34] A.O. Scott of the *New York Times* described it as \"a frustrating movie: full of heart and devoid of life; crudely manipulative when it tries hardest to be subtle; and profoundly complacent in spite of its intention to unsettle and disturb.\"[35]\n\n\nMuch criticism focused on how the film presents racism and its origins, with many noting its depiction of race relations as too simplistic and tidy. The redemption arcs of the white characters, particularly Sergeant Ryan, drew controversy for their execution.[36][37][26] Many opined that Ryan's redemption by way of his heroic rescue of Christine felt unearned.[37][36][38][32][25] Others pointed out the implausibility of Jean Cabot softening her racist attitudes because of an ankle sprain and the care of her Latina housemaid.[37] Clarisse Loughrey of the *Independent* wrote, \"By presenting racism as nothing more than a personality issue in need of a fix, *Crash* absolves its white audience of any sense of collective responsibility.\"[36]\n\n\n\n### Retrospective[edit]\n\n\nIn the years since the film's release, criticism and debate about the film have grown alongside ongoing cultural dialogues about race and social movements in the United States.[39][40] In 2009, cultural critic Ta-Nehisi Coates criticized the film as shallow and \"unthinking\", naming *Crash* \"the worst film of the decade\".[41] The film has been described as using multicultural and sentimentalist imagery to cover over material and \"historically sedimented inequalities\" that continue to affect various racial groups in Los Angeles.[42]\n\n\nIn a retrospective review, Tim Grierson of *The New Republic* opined, \"Haggis has characters hurl nasty epithets at one another, as if that's the most corrosive aspect of discrimination, failing to acknowledge that what's most destructive aren't the shouts but, rather, the whispers—the private jokes and long-held prejudices shared by likeminded people behind closed doors and far from public view.\"[43] The film was also criticized for depicting the Persian shopkeeper as a \"deranged, paranoid individual who is only redeemed by what he believes is a mystical act of God\".[44]\n\n\nThe film ranks at #460 in *Empire*'s 2008 poll of the \"500 Greatest Films of All Time\".[45]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Independent Film & Television Alliance selected *Crash* as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years.[46]\n\n\n\n### Top ten lists[edit]\n\n\n*Crash* was listed on many critics' top ten lists.[47]\n\n\n\n* 1st – Roger Ebert, *Chicago Sun-Times*\n* 1st – Steve Davis, *Austin Chronicle*\n* 3rd – Kevin Thomas, *Los Angeles Times*\n* 3rd – Richard Roeper, *Ebert & Roeper*[48]\n* 3rd – Ella Taylor, *L.A. Weekly*\n* 4th – Stephen Hunter, *The Washington Post*\n* 6th – Christy Lemire, Associated Press[49]\n* 7th – Claudia Puig, *USA Today*\n* 8th – Richard Schickel, *Time*\n* 8th – Lisa Schwarzbaum, *Entertainment Weekly*\n* 9th – Peter Travers, *Rolling Stone*\n\n### Oscar controversy[edit]\n\n\nAt the 78th Academy Awards, *Crash* won the Oscar for Best Picture, triumphing over the heavily favored *Brokeback Mountain* in what is considered as one of the most notable Oscars upsets.[50][51] After announcing the award, presenter Jack Nicholson was caught on camera mouthing the word \"whoa\" out of apparent surprise at the result.[52] The film's use of moral quandary as a storytelling medium was widely reported as ironic since many saw it as the \"safe\" alternative to *Brokeback Mountain*, which is about a gay relationship (the other nominees, *Good Night and Good Luck*, *Capote*, and *Munich* also tackle heavy subjects of McCarthyism, homosexuality, and terrorism).[53] Critic Kenneth Turan suggested that *Crash* benefited from homophobia among Academy members,[54][55] some of whom openly voiced their discomfort with *Brokeback Mountain* due to its subject matter.[56][57][58] After the Oscars telecast, critic Roger Ebert insisted in his column that the better film won the award.[59][60]\n\n\n*Film Comment* magazine placed *Crash* first on its list of \"Worst Winners of Best Picture Oscars\", followed by *Slumdog Millionaire* at #2 and *Chicago* at #3.[61] Similarly, a 2014 survey of film critics by *The Atlantic* identified the film's victory as among the most glaring mistakes made by the Academy Awards.[62] In 2017, David Ehrlich and Eric Kohn of *IndieWire* ranked *Crash* as the worst on its list of \"Best Picture Winners of the 21st Century, Ranked from Worst to Best\".[63]\n\n\nIn 2015, *The Hollywood Reporter* polled hundreds of Academy members, asking them to re-vote on past controversial decisions. For the 2005 Best Picture winner, *Brokeback Mountain* beat *Crash* and the other nominees.[64][65]\n\n\nIn a 2015 interview, Haggis commented, \"Was [*Crash*] the best film of the year? I don't think so. There were great films that year. *Good Night, and Good Luck* – amazing film. *Capote* – terrific film. Ang Lee's *Brokeback Mountain*, great film. And Spielberg's *Munich*. I mean please, what a year. *Crash*, for some reason, affected people, it touched people. And you can't judge these films like that. I'm very glad to have those Oscars. They're lovely things. But you shouldn't ask me what the best film of the year was because I wouldn't be voting for *Crash*, only because I saw the artistry that was in the other films. Now however, for some reason that's the film that touched people the most that year. So I guess that's what they voted for, something that really touched them. And I'm very proud of the fact that *Crash* does touch you. People still come up to me more than any of my films and say: 'That film just changed my life.' I've heard that dozens and dozens and dozens of times. So it did its job there. I mean, I knew it was the social experiment that I wanted, so I think it's a really good social experiment. Is it a great film? I don't know.\"[66][67]\n\n\nIn a 2020 retrospective about the film and its Oscars win, K. Austin Collins of *Vanity Fair* wrote the film \"is a throwback to a familiar strain of Oscar-friendly, liberal message movie—in which the 'message,' often, is that people are complicated, goodness is relative, and evil is not a terminal condition. It dramatizes racism the same way that classical Hollywood storytelling has long dramatized things: through a sense of character and intention and a guise of psychological realism, through arcs and archetypes, through a slow climb toward third-act revelations about who people really are as evinced by the things they've achieved, the changes they've undergone by film's end.\"[39]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Crash* (2004 film)\n\n*Crash* received several awards and nominations, and was named one of the top ten films of the year by both the American Film Institute[68] and the National Board of Review.[69] The film was nominated for six awards at the 78th Academy Awards and won three, for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Film Editing.[70] It was also nominated for nine British Academy Film Awards and won two, for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Newton.[71] Dillon received nominations for best supporting actor at the Academy Awards,[70] British Academy Film Awards,[71] Golden Globe Awards,[72] and Screen Actors Guild Awards[73] for his performance. Additionally, the cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture,[74] and Harris and Moresco won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay.[75]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Crash (soundtrack)\nThe original score was released by Superb Records through Lionsgate Films in 2005.[76][77] All songs were written and composed by Mark Isham, except where noted.[76] The iTunes release is the complete score released through Yari Music Group, and has the cues isolated and in film order (unlike the commercial score CD which is edited, incomplete, in a different order, and in suite form).[78] A second volume of tracks, titled *Crash: Music from and Inspired by the Film,* was released featuring songs that appear in the film.[79][80]\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Crash* was released on DVD on September 6, 2005, in widescreen and fullscreen one-disc versions.[81] Bonus features included a music video by KansasCali (now known as the Rocturnals) for the song \"If I...\" from the soundtrack. The director's cut of the film was released in a two-disc special edition DVD on April 4, 2006, with more bonus content than the one-disc set. The director's cut is three minutes longer than the theatrical cut. The scene where Daniel is talking with his daughter under her bed is extended and a new scene is added with officer Hansen in the police station locker room.[82]\n\n\n*Crash* was the first Best Picture winner to be released on Blu-ray Disc in the US, on June 27, 2006.[83]\n\n\n\n## Television series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Crash* (2008 TV series)\n\nA 13-episode series premiered on the Starz network on October 17, 2008. The series features Dennis Hopper as a record producer in Los Angeles, California, and how his life is connected to other characters in the city, including a police officer (Ross McCall) and his partner, actress-turned-police officer, Arlene Tur. The cast consists of a Brentwood mother (Clare Carey), her real-estate developer husband (D. B. Sweeney), a former gang member-turned-EMT (Brian Tee), a street-smart driver (Jocko Sims), an undocumented Guatemalan immigrant (Luis Chavez), and a detective (Nick Tarabay).[84]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Greater Los Angeles portal\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* *Grand Canyon* (1991 film)\n* *Magnolia* (1999 film)\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Crash (2005)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

It stars Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty, Christian Camargo, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, and Guy Pearce. The film follows an Iraq War Explosive Ordnance Disposal team who are targeted by insurgents and shows their psychological reactions to the stress of combat. Boal drew on his experience during embedded access to write the screenplay.\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* premiered at the 2008 Venice International Film Festival before it was released in the United States on June 26, 2009, by Summit Entertainment. The film earned acclaim from critics, who praised Bigelow's directing, Renner's performance, Boal's screenplay, editing, musical score, cinematography, sound design and action sequences. The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won six, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. It was the first Best Picture winner to have been directed by a woman. The film grossed $49.2 million worldwide.\n\n\nIt is now considered to be one of the best war films of the 2000s and the 21st century.[2][3][4] In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nDuring the second year of the Iraq War, a U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team with Bravo Company identifies and attempts to destroy an improvised explosive device with a robot, but the wagon carrying the trigger charge breaks. Team leader Staff Sergeant Matthew Thompson places the charge by hand, but is killed when a man with a cell phone detonates the charge. Squad mate Specialist Owen Eldridge feels guilty for failing to kill the man with the phone.\n\n\nSergeant First Class William James replaces Staff Sergeant Thompson. He is often at odds with Sergeant J. T. Sanborn because he prefers to defuse devices by hand and does not communicate his plans. He blocks Sanborn's view with smoke grenades as he approaches an IED and defuses it only moments before a man attempts to detonate it with a 9-volt battery. In another incident, James insists on disarming a complex car bomb despite Sanborn's protests that it is taking too long; James responds by taking off his headset and \"flipping off\" Sanborn. Sanborn is so worried by his conduct that he openly suggests fragging James to Eldridge while they are exploding unused ordnance outside of base.\n\n\nOn their return to base, they encounter five armed men in Arab garb by an SUV which has a flat tire. After a tense encounter, James learns they are friendly British private military contractors. While fixing the tire, they come under sniper fire. Three of the contractors are killed before James and Sanborn take over counter-sniping, killing three insurgents. Eldridge kills the fourth who attempts to flank their position.\n\n\nDuring a raid on a warehouse, James discovers a \"body bomb\" he believes is Beckham, an Iraqi boy who sells DVDs and plays soccer outside of base. During the evacuation, Lieutenant Colonel John Cambridge, the camp's psychiatrist and Eldridge's counselor, is killed in an explosion; Eldridge is further traumatized. James sneaks off base with Beckham's apparent associate at gunpoint, telling him to take him to Beckham's home. He is left at the home of an unrelated Iraqi professor, and James flees.\n\n\nCalled to a petrol tanker detonation, James decides to hunt for the insurgents responsible nearby. Sanborn protests, but when James begins a pursuit, he and Eldridge follow. After they split up, insurgents capture Eldridge. James and Sanborn rescue him, although Eldridge is shot in the leg. The following morning, James is approached by Beckham, alive and well, whom James ignores and walks by silently. Before being airlifted for surgery, Eldridge angrily blames James for his injury.\n\n\nThe day before their deployment ends, they are called to disarm a suicide bomb strapped to a man against his will. James cannot cut the locks off before the timer expires, and they are forced to abandon the man. Sanborn is distraught at the near death experience, and lamenting that no one other than his parents would've been sad at his death, tells James that he wishes to leave the service in order to have a son.\n\n\nAfter Bravo Company's rotation ends, James returns to his ex-wife Connie and their infant son. However, he is bored by routine civilian life at home. James confesses to his son there is only one thing he knows he loves. He starts another year-long tour of duty with Delta Company.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Jeremy Renner as Sergeant First Class William James\n* Anthony Mackie as Sergeant J. T.

The screenplay was written by Mark Boal, a freelance writer who was embedded as a journalist in 2004 with a U.S. Army EOD team in Iraq.\n\n\nThe film premiered at the Venice Film Festival in Italy during 2008. After being shown at the Toronto International Film Festival, it was picked up for distribution in the United States by Summit Entertainment. In May 2009, it was the Closing Night selection for Maryland Film Festival. The film was released in the United States on June 26, 2009, but received a more widespread theatrical release on July 24, 2009.\n\n\nThe film was nominated for nine Oscars at the 82nd Academy Awards in 2010, although the film had not yet recovered its budget by the time of the ceremony.[6] It won six Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director for Bigelow (the first woman to win this award), and Best Original Screenplay for Boal.\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* is based on accounts of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad in the war in Iraq for two weeks in 2004.[7] Director Bigelow was familiar with Boal's work before his experiences, having adapted one of his *Playboy* articles as the short-lived television series *The Inside* in 2002. When Boal was embedded with the squad, he accompanied its members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks, and kept in touch with Bigelow via email about his experiences.[8] Boal used his experiences as the basis of a fictional drama based on real events.\n\n\nHe said of the film's goal, \"The idea is that it's the first movie about the Iraq War that purports to show the experience of the soldiers. We wanted to show the kinds of things that soldiers go through that you can't see on CNN, and I don't mean that in a censorship-conspiracy way. I just mean the news doesn't actually put photographers in with units that are this elite.\"[9] Bigelow was fascinated with exploring \"the psychology behind the type of soldier who volunteers for this particular conflict and then, because of [their] aptitude, is chosen and given the opportunity to go into bomb disarmament and goes *toward* what everybody else is running from.\"[10]\n\n\nWhile working with Boal in 2005 on the script, originally titled *The Something Jacket,* Bigelow began to do some preliminary, rough storyboards to get an idea of the specific location needed. Bomb disarmament protocol requires a containment area. She wanted to make the film as authentic as possible and \"put the audience into the Humvee, into a boots-on-the-ground experience.\"[10]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nJeremy Renner\n![](image)\nAnthony Mackie\n![](image)\nBrian Geraghty\n\nFor the main characters, Bigelow made a point of casting relatively unknown actors: \"it underscored the tension because with the lack of familiarity also comes a sense of unpredictability.\"[10] Renner's character, Sergeant First Class William James, is a composite character, with qualities based on individuals whom screenwriter Boal knew when embedded with the bomb squad.[8] Bigelow cast Renner based on his work in *Dahmer*, a film about Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious serial killer whose victims were boys.[11] To prepare for the film, Renner spent a week living and training at Fort Irwin, a U.S. military reservation in the Mojave Desert in California. He was taught to use C4 explosives, learned how to render safe improvised explosive devices, and how to wear a bomb suit.[11]\n\n\nMackie plays Sergeant J. T. Sanborn. Describing the experience of filming in Jordan in the summer, he said, \"It was so desperately hot, and we were so easily agitated. But that movie was like doing a play. We really looked out for each other, and it was a great experience. It made me believe in film.\"[12]\n\n\nSeveral hundred thousand Iraqi refugees live in Jordan. Bigelow cast refugees who had theatrical backgrounds, such as Suhail Dabbach who plays the innocent man used as a suicide bomber at the film's end.[8]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nThe film was shot in Jordan, within miles of the Iraqi border, to achieve Bigelow's goal of authenticity. Iraqi refugees were used for extras and the cast worked in the intense heat of the Middle East. The filmmakers had scouted for locations in Morocco, but Bigelow felt its cities did not resemble Baghdad. In addition, she wanted to get as close to the war zone as possible. Some of the locations were less than three miles from the Iraqi border.[13] Bigelow had wanted to film in Iraq, but the production security team could not guarantee their safety from snipers.[10]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began in July 2007 in Jordan and Kuwait. Temperatures averaged 120 °F (49 °C) over the 44 days of shooting.[9][10][11] Often four or more camera crews filmed simultaneously, which resulted in nearly 200 hours of footage.[13][14] The producer Greg Shapiro spoke about security concerns of filming in Jordan, \"It was interesting telling people we were going to make the movie in Jordan because the first question everybody asked was about the security situation here.\"\n\n\nBigelow's choice to film in Jordan met some resistance. In discussion, she found that her cast and crew shared stereotypes of the region from American culture. \"Sadly people in America and Los Angeles have these perceptions\", she said. \"But once you get off the plane you realize it's like Manhattan without the trees\", she continued. As Iraq dominated discourse in America and around the world, Bigelow believed that filmmakers would continue to explore the conflict, making Jordan the natural place to film.[15]\n\n\n\nAccording to producer Tony Mark, the blood, sweat and heat captured on-camera in the production was mirrored behind the scenes. \n\n\n> \"It's a tough, tough movie about a tough, tough subject\", Mark said in an interview, \"There was a palpable tension throughout on the set. It was just like the onscreen story of three guys who fight with each other, but when the time comes to do the work, they come together to get the job done.\"[16]\n> \n> \n\n Renner remembered, \"I got food bugs. Then I got food poisoning: lost 15 lbs in three days\".[11] In addition to the burden of the heat, the bomb suit he had to wear all day weighed 80–100 lb (36–45 kg).[17] In a scene in which his character carries a dead Iraqi boy, Renner fell down some stairs and twisted his ankle, which delayed filming because he could not walk. At that point, \"people wanted to quit. All the departments were struggling to get their job done, none of them were communicating\".[11] A week later, filming resumed.[11]\n\n\nTony Mark recalled the armorer David Fencl's finishing a 12-hour day. He found he had to stay up all night to make proper ammunition for a sniper rifle, as the supplies did not clear Jordanian customs in time for the scheduled shoot.[16] Due to import restrictions on military props, the film's special effects artist Richard Stutsman used Chinese fireworks for gunpowder. One day, he was assembling a prop, and the heat and friction caused the fireworks to blow up in his face. Two days later, he returned to work.[11] The film shoot had few of the normal Hollywood perks; nobody on the set got an air-conditioned trailer or a private bathroom.[16] Renner said that great care was taken to ensure the film's authenticity.[18] According to Renner, shooting the film in the Middle East contributed to this. \"There were two-by-fours with nails being dropped from two-story buildings that hit me in the helmet, and they were throwing rocks.... We got shot at a few times while we were filming\", Renner said. \"When you see it, you're gonna feel like you've been in war.\"[19]\n\n\n\n\n> \"You can't fake that amount of heat\", Mackie says, adding, \"When you are on set and all of the extras are Iraqi refugees, it really informs the movie that you're making. When you start hearing the stories from a true perspective ... of people who were actually there, it gives you a clear viewpoint of where you are as an artist and the story you would like to tell. It was a great experience to be there.\"[20]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Cinematography[edit]\n\n\nFor the film, director Bigelow sought to immerse audiences \"into something that was raw, immediate and visceral\". Impressed with cinematographer Barry Ackroyd's work on *United 93* and *The Wind That Shakes the Barley,* Bigelow invited him to work on her film. While the film was independently produced and filmed on a low budget, Bigelow used four Super 16 mm cameras to capture multiple perspectives, saying, \n\n\n\n\n> \"That's how we experience reality, by looking at the microcosm and the macrocosm simultaneously. The eye sees differently than the lens, but with multiple focal lengths and a muscular editorial style, the lens can give you that microcosm/macrocosm perspective and that contributes to the feeling of total immersion.\"[21]\n> \n> \n\n In staging the film's action sequences, Bigelow did not want to lose a sense of the geography and used multiple cameras to allow her to \"look at any particular set-piece from every possible perspective.\"[10]\n\n\n### Editing[edit]\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* was edited by Chris Innis and Bob Murawski.[22][23] The two editors worked with almost 200 hours of footage from the multiple hand-held cameras in use during the shoot.[23] Adding to the challenge, Boal's screenplay had a non-traditional, asymmetrical, episodic structure. There was no traditional \"villain\", and tension was derived from the characters' internal conflicts and the suspense from the explosives and snipers.[23]\n\n\n\n\n> \"This movie is kind of like a horror film where you're unable to see the killer,\" says Innis. \"You know a bomb could go off at any minute, but you never know just when it's going to happen, so the ideas of [Alfred] Hitchcock—about making your audience anxious—were influential for us when we did the editing.\"[24]\n> \n> \n\nThe raw footage was described as a \"hodge-podge of disconnected, nausea-inducing motion that was constantly crossing the 180-degree line\".[23]\n\n\nInnis spent the first eight weeks editing the film on location in Jordan, before returning to Los Angeles, where Murawski joined her. The process took over eight months to complete.[22][25] The goal was to edit a brutally realistic portrayal of the realities of war, using minimal special effects or technical enhancement.[22][23] Innis stated that they \"really wanted the film to retain that 'newsreel' documentary quality... Too many stage-y effects would have been distracting. The editing in this film was all about restraint\".[22]\n\n\nEditing on location led to additional complications in post-production. The production was unwilling to risk sending undeveloped film through high-security airports where the cans could be opened, X-rayed, or damaged. Accordingly, film was hand-carried on a flight by a production assistant from Amman to London. After the Super 16mm film was transferred to DVcam at a lab in London, the video dailies were transported by plane back to the Middle East to be imported into the editing system. The whole journey would take anywhere from three days to a week and was described by Innis as the \"modern-day equivalent of shipping via donkey cart.\"[23] The low production budget and the lack of a developed film infrastructure in the area hampered the process, according to Innis. \"We were working with grainy Super 16mm film, editing in standard definition. We tried doing FTP downloads, but at the time, the facilities in Jordan simply couldn't handle it.\"[22][23] Producer Tony Mark later negotiated the use of a local radio station late at night to receive low-grade QuickTime clips over the Internet so the crew would not be shooting blindly.[23]\n\n\n\n### Musical score and sound[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Hurt Locker (soundtrack)\n\nMarco Beltrami and Buck Sanders composed the score. Bigelow wanted Beltrami to score for the film, as she liked his critically acclaimed work in *3:10 to Yuma* (2007). Paul N. J. Ottosson worked on the film's sound design.[26] The score was released in June 2009 through Lakeshore Records.\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Festival screenings[edit]\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* had its world premiere at the Venice International Film Festival on September 4, 2008, and the film received a 10-minute standing ovation at the end of its screening.[27] At the festival, the film won the SIGNIS award,[28] the Arca Cinemagiovani Award (Arca Young Cinema Award) for \"Best Film Venezia 65\" (chosen by an international youth jury); the Human Rights Film Network Award; and the Venezia Cinema Award known as the \"Navicella\".[29] The film also screened at the 33rd Annual Toronto International Film Festival on September 8,[27] where it generated \"keen interest\", though distributors were reluctant to buy it since previous films about the Iraq War performed poorly at the box office.[30] Summit Entertainment purchased the film for distribution in the United States in what was perceived as \"a skittish climate for pic sales\".[31]\n\n\nIn the rest of 2008, *The Hurt Locker* screened at the 3rd Zurich Film Festival,[32] the 37th Festival du Nouveau Cinéma, the 21st Mar del Plata Film Festival,[33] the 5th Dubai International Film Festival, and the 12th Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival.[34] In 2009, *The Hurt Locker* screened at the Göteborg International Film Festival,[35] the 10th *Film Comment* Selects festival,[36] and the South by Southwest film festival.[37] It was the closing night film at Maryland Film Festival 2009, with Bigelow presenting. It had a centerpiece screening at the 3rd AFI Dallas International Film Festival, where director Kathryn Bigelow received the Dallas Star Award.[38] Other 2009 festivals included the Human Rights Nights International Film Festival,[39] the Seattle International Film Festival,[40] and the Philadelphia Film Festival.[41]\n\n\n\n### Theatrical run[edit]\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* was first publicly released in Italy by Warner Bros. on October 10, 2008.[27] Summit Entertainment picked the film up for distribution in the United States for $1.5 million after it was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival.[42]\n*The Hurt Locker* was released in the United States on June 26, 2009, with a limited release at four theaters in Los Angeles and New York City.[43] Over its first weekend the film grossed $145,352, averaging $36,338 per theater. The following weekend, beginning July 3, the film grossed $131,202 at nine theaters, averaging $14,578 per theater.[44] \nIt held the highest per-screen average of any film playing theatrically in the United States for the first two weeks of its release,[1] gradually moving into the top 20 chart with much wider-released, bigger budget studio films.[45] It held around number 13 or number 14 on box office charts for an additional four weeks. Summit Entertainment took *The Hurt Locker* wider to more than 200 screens on July 24, 2009, and more than 500 screens on July 31, 2009.\n\n\nThe film's final gross was $17,017,811 in the United States and Canada, and $32,212,961 in other countries, bringing its worldwide total to $49,230,772. It was a success against its budget of $15 million.[1]\n\n\nAccording to the *Los Angeles Times*, *The Hurt Locker* performed better than most recent dramas about Middle East conflict. The film outperformed all other Iraq-war-themed films such as *In the Valley of Elah* (2007), *Stop-Loss* (2008) and Afghanistan-themed *Lions for Lambs* (2007).[42]\n\n\nIn the United States, *The Hurt Locker* is one of only five Best Picture winners (*The English Patient*, *Amadeus*, *The Artist*, and *The Shape of Water* being the other four) to never enter the weekend box office top 5 since top 10 rankings were first recorded in 1982. It is also one of the only two Best Picture winners on record never to have entered the weekend box office top 10 (*The Artist* being the other).\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* opened in the top ten in the United Kingdom in 103 theaters, scoring the fourth-highest per-screen average of $3,607, ranking between *G-Force* and *G.I. Joe* in overall grosses. The film garnered half a million dollars in its opening weekend in the United Kingdom of August 28 through August 30, 2009,[46] and grossed over a million dollars in the UK, Japan, Spain, and France through March.[47]\n\n\n\n### Distribution: Independent film print shortage[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an article in the Springfield, Illinois *State Journal-Register*, as of August 2009, there was a shortage of film prints of *The Hurt Locker*, as well as other hit independent films such as *Food, Inc.*[48] Distributors told theater owners that they would have to wait weeks or months past the initial U.S. release date to get the few available prints that were already in distribution. \"Sometimes the distributors goof up,\" said a film buyer for one theater. \"They misjudge how wide they should go.\"[48] One theory is that the independent films have a hard time competing for screen space during the summer against blockbuster tent-pole films that take up as much as half the screens in any given city, flooding the United States market with thousands of prints. Theater owners have also complained about distributors \"bunching too many movies too close together\".[48][49] It is also thought that independent film distributors are trying to cut their losses on prints by recycling them. Given the popularity of some of the films that are \"hard to come by\", this strategy may be leaving box office money on the table.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* was released on DVD and Blu-ray in North America on January 12, 2010. This disc includes an added audio commentary featuring director Kathryn Bigelow, writer Mark Boal, and other members of the production crew; an image gallery of photos from shooting; and a 15-minute EPK featurette highlighting the filming experience in Jordan and the film's production. The UK DVD and Blu-ray have no commentary.\n\n\nOn February 22, 2022, two years after getting a digital 4K release, Lionsgate and Best Buy released a steelbook of the movie, marking the first time it came to 4K resolution.\nU.S. sales of the DVD topped $30 million by mid-August 2010.[50]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* received widespread acclaim, with Renner's performance receiving praise from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 97%, based on 290 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 8.5/10. It was the second highest-rated film of 2009, behind Pixar's *Up*. The critics' consensus reads, \"A well-acted, intensely shot, action filled war epic, Kathryn Bigelow's *The Hurt Locker* is thus far the best of the recent dramatizations of the Iraq War.\"[51] Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score, gave the film an average score of 95 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[52]\n\n\nRoger Ebert of *The Chicago Sun Times* rated the film as the best of 2009, writing, \"*The Hurt Locker* is a great film, an intelligent film, a film shot clearly so that we know exactly who everybody is and where they are and what they're doing and why.\" He applauded how the suspense was built, calling the film \"spellbinding\". Ebert considered Renner \"a leading contender for Academy Awards\", writing, \"His performance is not built on complex speeches but on a visceral projection of who this man is and what he feels. He is not a hero in a conventional sense.\"[53] He eventually ranked it the second-best film of the decade, behind only *Synecdoche, New York*.[54]\n\n\nRichard Corliss of *Time* magazine also spoke highly of Renner's performance, calling it a highlight of the film. Corliss wrote,\n\n\n\n\n> \"He's ordinary, pudgy-faced, quiet, and at first seems to lack the screen charisma to carry a film. That supposition vanishes in a few minutes, as Renner slowly reveals the strength, confidence and unpredictability of a young Russell Crowe. The merging of actor and character is one of the big things to love about this movie... It's a creepy marvel to watch James in action. He has the cool aplomb, analytical acumen and attention to detail of a great athlete, or a master psychopath, maybe both.\"[55]\n> \n> \n\nCorliss praised the film's \"steely calm\" tone, reflective of its main character. Corliss summarized, \"*The Hurt Locker* is a near-perfect movie about men in war, men at work. Through sturdy imagery and violent action, it says that even Hell needs heroes.\"[55]\n\n\nA. O. Scott of *The New York Times* called *The Hurt Locker* the best American feature film yet made about the war in Iraq: \n\n\n\n\n> \"You may emerge from *The Hurt Locker* shaken, exhilarated and drained, but you will also be thinking ... The movie is a viscerally exciting, adrenaline-soaked tour de force of suspense and surprise, full of explosions and hectic scenes of combat, but it blows a hole in the condescending assumption that such effects are just empty spectacle or mindless noise.\"[56]\n> \n> \n\nScott noticed that the film reserved criticism of the war but wrote of how the director handled the film's limits, \"Ms. Bigelow, practicing a kind of hyperbolic realism, distills the psychological essence and moral complications of modern warfare into a series of brilliant, agonizing set pieces.\" He also applauded the convergence of the characters in the film, saying that it \"focuses on three men whose contrasting temperaments knit this episodic exploration of peril and bravery into a coherent and satisfying story.\"[56] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that the performances of Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty would raise their profiles considerably, and said their characters reveal their \"unlooked-for aspects,\" such as Renner's character being playful with an Iraqi boy. Turan applauded Boal's \"lean and compelling\" script and said of Bigelow's direction, \"Bigelow and her team bring an awesome ferocity to re-creating the unhinged mania of bomb removal in an alien, culturally unfathomable atmosphere.\"[57]\n\n\nGuy Westwell of *Sight & Sound* wrote that the cinematographer Barry Ackroyd provided \"sharp handheld coverage\" and that Paul N.J. Ottosson's sound design \"uses the barely perceptible ringing of tinnitus to amp up the tension.\"[58] Westwell praised the director's skill:\n\n\n\n\n> \"The careful mapping of the subtle differences between each bomb, the play with point of view ... and the attenuation of key action sequences ... lends the film a distinctive quality that can only be attributed to Bigelow's clever, confident direction.\"[58]\n> \n> \n\nThe critic noted the film's different take on the Iraq War, writing that \"it confronts the fact that men often take great pleasure in war.\"[58] He concluded,\n\n\n\n> \"This unapologetic celebration of a testosterone-fuelled lust for war may gall. Yet there is something original and distinctive about the film's willingness to admit that for some men (and many moviegoers) war carries an intrinsic dramatic charge.\"[58]\n> \n> \n\n\nAmy Taubin of *Film Comment* described *The Hurt Locker* as \"a structuralist war movie\" and \"a totally immersive, off-the-charts high-anxiety experience from beginning to end.\" Taubin praised Ackroyd's \"brilliant\" cinematography with multiple viewpoints. She said of the film's editing, \"Bob Murawski and Chris Innis's editing is similarly quick and nervous; the rapid changes in POV as they cut from one camera's coverage to another's, makes you feel as if you, like the characters, are under threat from all sides.\"[59]\n\n\nJoe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* called it \"A first-rate action thriller, a vivid evocation of urban warfare in Iraq, a penetrating study of heroism and a showcase for austere technique, terse writing and a trio of brilliant performances.\"[60] The *Toronto Star* critic Peter Howell said, \"Just when you think the battle of Iraq war dramas has been fought and lost, along comes one that demands to be seen... If you can sit through *The Hurt Locker* without your heart nearly pounding through your chest, you must be made of granite.\"[61] *Entertainment Weekly'*s film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film the rare \"A\" rating, calling it, \"an intense, action-driven war pic, a muscular, efficient standout that simultaneously conveys the feeling of combat from within as well as what it looks like on the ground. This ain't no war videogame.\"[62]\n\n\nDerek Elley of *Variety* found *The Hurt Locker* to be \"gripping\" as a thriller but felt that the film was weakened by, \"its fuzzy (and hardly original) psychology.\" Elley wrote that it was unclear to know where the drama lay: \"These guys get by on old-fashioned guts and instinct rather than sissy hardware—but it's not a pure men-under-stress drama either.\" The critic also felt that the script showed \"signs of artificially straining for character depth.\"[63] Anne Thompson, also writing for *Variety*, believed *The Hurt Locker* to be a contender for Best Picture, particularly based on the unique subject matter pursued by a female director and on being an exception to other films about the Iraq War, which had performed poorly.[64]\n\n\nTara McKelvey from *The American Prospect* wrote that the film is pro-U.S. Army propaganda, although it suggests it is anti-war with the opening statement: \"War is a drug.\" She continues,\n\n\n\n\n> \"You feel empathy for the soldiers when they shoot. And in this way, the full impact of the Iraq war—at least as it was fought in 2004—becomes clear: American soldiers shot at Iraqi civilians even when, for example, they just happened to be holding a cell phone and standing near an IED.\" She concludes, \"For all the graphic violence, bloody explosions and, literally, human butchery that is shown in the film, *The Hurt Locker* is one of the most effective recruiting vehicles for the U.S. Army that I have seen.\"[65]\n> \n> \n\n\nJohn Pilger, journalist and documentarian, criticized the film in the *New Statesman*, writing that it \"offers a vicarious thrill via yet another standard-issue psychopath high on violence in somebody else's country where the deaths of a million people are consigned to cinematic oblivion.\"[66]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Independent Film & Television Alliance selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years.[67]\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* was named the tenth \"Best Film of the 21st Century So Far\" in 2017 by *The New York Times* chief film critics A. O. Scott and Manohla Dargis.[68]\n\n\n\n### Response among veterans[edit]\n\n\nThe film was criticized by some Iraq veterans and embedded reporters for inaccurately portraying wartime conditions.[69] Writing for *The Huffington Post*, Iraq veteran Kate Hoit said that *The Hurt Locker* is \"Hollywood's version of the Iraq war and of the soldiers who fight it, and their version is inaccurate.\" She described the film as being \"better than a lot of the recent war movies that have been released\" but expressed concerns that several errors—among them wrong uniforms, lack of radio communication, or misbehavior of the soldiers—would alienate service members from enjoying the film.[70]\n\n\nAuthor Brandon Friedman, also a combat veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, shared a similar view at *VetVoice*: \"*The Hurt Locker* is a high-tension, well-made, action movie that will certainly keep most viewers on the edges of their seats. But if you know anything about the Army, or about operations or life in Iraq, you'll be so distracted by the nonsensical sequences and plot twists that it will ruin the movie for you. It certainly did for me.\" Friedman criticized the inaccuracy of the film's representation of combat, saying, \"in real life, EOD techs don't conduct dangerous missions as autonomous three-man teams without communications gear ... Another thing you'll rarely hear in combat is an EOD E-7 suggesting to two or three of his guys that they leave the scene of an explosion in an Iraqi city by saying: 'C'mon, let's split up. We can cover more ground that way.'\"[71]\n\n\nAt the blog *Army of Dude*, infantryman and Iraq veteran Alex Horton noted that \"the way the team goes about their missions is completely absurd.\" He still generally enjoyed it and called it \"the best Iraq movie to date.\"[72]\n\n\nTroy Steward, another combat veteran, wrote on the blog *Bouhammer* that while the film accurately depicted the scale of bomb violence and the relations between Iraqis and troops, \"just about everything else wasn't realistic.\" Steward went on to say: \"I was amazed that a movie so bad could get any kind of accolades from anyone.\"[73]\n\n\nA review published March 8, 2010, in the *Air Force Times* cited overall negative reviews from bomb experts in Iraq attached to the 4th Brigade, 1st Armored Division, quoting a bomb disposal team leader who called the film's portrayal of a bomb expert \"grossly exaggerated and not appropriate,\" and describing the lead character as \"more of a run and gun cowboy type … exactly the kind of person that we're not looking for.\"[74] Another bomb disposal team member said that the lead character's \"swagger would put a whole team at risk. Our team leaders don't have that kind of invincibility complex, and if they do, they aren't allowed to operate. A team leader's first priority is getting his team home in one piece.\"[74]\n\n\nOn the embedded side, former correspondent for *The Politico* and *Military Times* Christian Lowe (who embedded with U.S. military units each year from 2002 to 2005) explained at *DefenseTech*: \"Some of the scenes are so disconnected with reality to be almost parody.\"[75]\n\n\nFormer British bomb disposal officer Guy Marot said, \"James makes us look like hot-headed, irrational adrenaline junkies with no self-discipline. It’s immensely disrespectful to the many officers who have lost their lives.\"[76]\n\n\nOn the other hand, Henry Engelhardt, an adjutant with the National Explosive Ordnance Disposal Association having twenty years' experience in bomb defusal, complimented the film's atmosphere and depiction of the difficulties of the job, saying, \"Of course, no film is realistic in all its details, but the important things were done very well.\"[77]\n\n\n\n### Top ten lists[edit]\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* was listed on many critics' top ten lists.[78]\n\n\n\n* 1st – David Ansen, *Newsweek*\n* 1st – J.

It also ranked on more film critics' top 10 lists than any other film of 2009. It was nominated in nine categories at the 82nd Academy Awards and won in six: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Film Editing. It lost the award for Best Actor to *Crazy Heart*, Best Original Score to *Up*, and Best Cinematography to *Avatar*.[81] Bigelow became the first woman to win an Oscar for Best Director.[82]\n\n\nKathryn Bigelow was awarded the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Achievement in Feature Film for the film, being only one of three women to do so along with Chloe Zhao for *Nomadland* and Jane Campion for *The Power of the Dog*.[83] The film won six awards at the BAFTAs held on February 21, 2010, including Best Film and Best Director for Bigelow. *The Hurt Locker* was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards.[84]\n\n\nThe Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association Award for Best Director was given to Kathryn Bigelow, the first time the honor has gone to a woman. The film swept most critics groups awards for Best Director and Best Picture, including Chicago, Boston, and Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York' film critics group associations. *The Hurt Locker* is one of only six films that have won all three major U.S. critics group prizes (LA, NY, NSFC), together with *Goodfellas*, *Schindler's List*, *L.A. Confidential*, *The Social Network,* and *Drive My Car*; and also the second to win Best Picture after *Schindler's List*.\n\n\nThe five awards from the Boston Society of Film Critics were the most by that organization to a single film in the group's 30-year history.[85]\n\n\nIn February 2010, the film's producer Nicolas Chartier emailed a group of Academy Award voters in an attempt to sway them to vote for *The Hurt Locker* instead of \"a $500M film\" (referring to *Avatar*) for the Best Picture award. He later issued a public apology, saying that it was \"out of line and not in the spirit of the celebration of cinema that this acknowledgment is\".[86] The Academy banned him from attending the award ceremony, the first time the academy has ever banned an individual nominee.[87]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits[edit]\n\n\n### Sarver lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn early March 2010, U.S. Army bomb disposal expert Master Sergeant Jeffrey Sarver filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against *The Hurt Locker*. Sarver's lawsuit claimed he used the term \"hurt locker\" and the phrase \"war is a drug\" around Boal, that his likeness was used to create the character William James, and that the portrayal of James defames Sarver.[88] Sarver said he felt \"just a little bit hurt, a little bit felt left out\" and cheated out of \"financial participation\" in the film.[89] Sarver claimed he originated the title of the film; however, according to the film's website, the title is a decades-old colloquialism for being injured, as in \"they sent him to the hurt locker.\"[90] It dates back to the Vietnam War where it was one of several phrases meaning \"in trouble or at a disadvantage; in bad shape.\"[91]\n\n\nBoal defended himself to the press, saying \"the film is a work of fiction inspired by many people's stories.\"[89] He said he talked to more than 100 soldiers during his research.[92] Jody Simon, a Los Angeles-based entertainment lawyer, noted that \"soldiers don't have privacy,\" and that when the military embedded Boal they gave him full permission to use his observations as he saw fit. Summit Entertainment, the producers of the film, said in early March that they hoped for a quick resolution to the suit.[89] In the December 8, 2011, issue of *The Hollywood Reporter*, it was announced that the court threw out Sarver's lawsuit. A federal judge ordered him to pay more than $180,000 in attorney fees.[93]\n\n\n\n### Copyright infringement lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nOn May 12, 2010, Voltage Pictures, the production company behind *The Hurt Locker*, announced that it would attempt to sue \"potentially tens of thousands\" of online computer users who downloaded unlicensed copies of the film using the BitTorrent and P2P networks. It would be the largest lawsuit of its kind.[94][95] On May 28, 2010, it filed a complaint against 5,000 unidentified BitTorrent users in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia; Voltage announced its intention to demand $1,500 from each defendant to release him or her from the suit.[96] Several people, however, refused to settle with the studio.[97] The US Copyright Group (USCG) has since dropped all cases against the alleged *Hurt Locker* downloaders.[98]\n\n\nOn August 29, 2011, the Federal Court of Canada ordered three Canadian ISPs—Bell Canada, Cogeco, and Vidéotron—to disclose the names and addresses of the subscribers whose IP addresses were suspected of having downloaded a copy of the film. The ISPs were given two weeks to comply with the order.[99]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"*The Hurt Locker* (2009)\". Box Office Mojo.

It stars Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty, Christian Camargo, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, and Guy Pearce. The film follows an Iraq War Explosive Ordnance Disposal team who are targeted by insurgents and shows their psychological reactions to the stress of combat. Boal drew on his experience during embedded access to write the screenplay.\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* premiered at the 2008 Venice International Film Festival before it was released in the United States on June 26, 2009, by Summit Entertainment. The film earned acclaim from critics, who praised Bigelow's directing, Renner's performance, Boal's screenplay, editing, musical score, cinematography, sound design and action sequences. The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won six, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. It was the first Best Picture winner to have been directed by a woman. The film grossed $49.2 million worldwide.\n\n\nIt is now considered to be one of the best war films of the 2000s and the 21st century.[2][3][4] In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nDuring the second year of the Iraq War, a U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team with Bravo Company identifies and attempts to destroy an improvised explosive device with a robot, but the wagon carrying the trigger charge breaks. Team leader Staff Sergeant Matthew Thompson places the charge by hand, but is killed when a man with a cell phone detonates the charge. Squad mate Specialist Owen Eldridge feels guilty for failing to kill the man with the phone.\n\n\nSergeant First Class William James replaces Staff Sergeant Thompson. He is often at odds with Sergeant J. T. Sanborn because he prefers to defuse devices by hand and does not communicate his plans. He blocks Sanborn's view with smoke grenades as he approaches an IED and defuses it only moments before a man attempts to detonate it with a 9-volt battery. In another incident, James insists on disarming a complex car bomb despite Sanborn's protests that it is taking too long; James responds by taking off his headset and \"flipping off\" Sanborn. Sanborn is so worried by his conduct that he openly suggests fragging James to Eldridge while they are exploding unused ordnance outside of base.\n\n\nOn their return to base, they encounter five armed men in Arab garb by an SUV which has a flat tire. After a tense encounter, James learns they are friendly British private military contractors. While fixing the tire, they come under sniper fire. Three of the contractors are killed before James and Sanborn take over counter-sniping, killing three insurgents. Eldridge kills the fourth who attempts to flank their position.\n\n\nDuring a raid on a warehouse, James discovers a \"body bomb\" he believes is Beckham, an Iraqi boy who sells DVDs and plays soccer outside of base. During the evacuation, Lieutenant Colonel John Cambridge, the camp's psychiatrist and Eldridge's counselor, is killed in an explosion; Eldridge is further traumatized. James sneaks off base with Beckham's apparent associate at gunpoint, telling him to take him to Beckham's home. He is left at the home of an unrelated Iraqi professor, and James flees.\n\n\nCalled to a petrol tanker detonation, James decides to hunt for the insurgents responsible nearby. Sanborn protests, but when James begins a pursuit, he and Eldridge follow. After they split up, insurgents capture Eldridge. James and Sanborn rescue him, although Eldridge is shot in the leg. The following morning, James is approached by Beckham, alive and well, whom James ignores and walks by silently. Before being airlifted for surgery, Eldridge angrily blames James for his injury.\n\n\nThe day before their deployment ends, they are called to disarm a suicide bomb strapped to a man against his will. James cannot cut the locks off before the timer expires, and they are forced to abandon the man. Sanborn is distraught at the near death experience, and lamenting that no one other than his parents would've been sad at his death, tells James that he wishes to leave the service in order to have a son.\n\n\nAfter Bravo Company's rotation ends, James returns to his ex-wife Connie and their infant son. However, he is bored by routine civilian life at home. James confesses to his son there is only one thing he knows he loves. He starts another year-long tour of duty with Delta Company.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Jeremy Renner as Sergeant First Class William James\n* Anthony Mackie as Sergeant J. T.

The screenplay was written by Mark Boal, a freelance writer who was embedded as a journalist in 2004 with a U.S. Army EOD team in Iraq.\n\n\nThe film premiered at the Venice Film Festival in Italy during 2008. After being shown at the Toronto International Film Festival, it was picked up for distribution in the United States by Summit Entertainment. In May 2009, it was the Closing Night selection for Maryland Film Festival. The film was released in the United States on June 26, 2009, but received a more widespread theatrical release on July 24, 2009.\n\n\nThe film was nominated for nine Oscars at the 82nd Academy Awards in 2010, although the film had not yet recovered its budget by the time of the ceremony.[6] It won six Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director for Bigelow (the first woman to win this award), and Best Original Screenplay for Boal.\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* is based on accounts of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad in the war in Iraq for two weeks in 2004.[7] Director Bigelow was familiar with Boal's work before his experiences, having adapted one of his *Playboy* articles as the short-lived television series *The Inside* in 2002. When Boal was embedded with the squad, he accompanied its members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks, and kept in touch with Bigelow via email about his experiences.[8] Boal used his experiences as the basis of a fictional drama based on real events.\n\n\nHe said of the film's goal, \"The idea is that it's the first movie about the Iraq War that purports to show the experience of the soldiers. We wanted to show the kinds of things that soldiers go through that you can't see on CNN, and I don't mean that in a censorship-conspiracy way. I just mean the news doesn't actually put photographers in with units that are this elite.\"[9] Bigelow was fascinated with exploring \"the psychology behind the type of soldier who volunteers for this particular conflict and then, because of [their] aptitude, is chosen and given the opportunity to go into bomb disarmament and goes *toward* what everybody else is running from.\"[10]\n\n\nWhile working with Boal in 2005 on the script, originally titled *The Something Jacket,* Bigelow began to do some preliminary, rough storyboards to get an idea of the specific location needed. Bomb disarmament protocol requires a containment area. She wanted to make the film as authentic as possible and \"put the audience into the Humvee, into a boots-on-the-ground experience.\"[10]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nJeremy Renner\n![](image)\nAnthony Mackie\n![](image)\nBrian Geraghty\n\nFor the main characters, Bigelow made a point of casting relatively unknown actors: \"it underscored the tension because with the lack of familiarity also comes a sense of unpredictability.\"[10] Renner's character, Sergeant First Class William James, is a composite character, with qualities based on individuals whom screenwriter Boal knew when embedded with the bomb squad.[8] Bigelow cast Renner based on his work in *Dahmer*, a film about Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious serial killer whose victims were boys.[11] To prepare for the film, Renner spent a week living and training at Fort Irwin, a U.S. military reservation in the Mojave Desert in California. He was taught to use C4 explosives, learned how to render safe improvised explosive devices, and how to wear a bomb suit.[11]\n\n\nMackie plays Sergeant J. T. Sanborn. Describing the experience of filming in Jordan in the summer, he said, \"It was so desperately hot, and we were so easily agitated. But that movie was like doing a play. We really looked out for each other, and it was a great experience. It made me believe in film.\"[12]\n\n\nSeveral hundred thousand Iraqi refugees live in Jordan. Bigelow cast refugees who had theatrical backgrounds, such as Suhail Dabbach who plays the innocent man used as a suicide bomber at the film's end.[8]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nThe film was shot in Jordan, within miles of the Iraqi border, to achieve Bigelow's goal of authenticity. Iraqi refugees were used for extras and the cast worked in the intense heat of the Middle East. The filmmakers had scouted for locations in Morocco, but Bigelow felt its cities did not resemble Baghdad. In addition, she wanted to get as close to the war zone as possible. Some of the locations were less than three miles from the Iraqi border.[13] Bigelow had wanted to film in Iraq, but the production security team could not guarantee their safety from snipers.[10]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began in July 2007 in Jordan and Kuwait. Temperatures averaged 120 °F (49 °C) over the 44 days of shooting.[9][10][11] Often four or more camera crews filmed simultaneously, which resulted in nearly 200 hours of footage.[13][14] The producer Greg Shapiro spoke about security concerns of filming in Jordan, \"It was interesting telling people we were going to make the movie in Jordan because the first question everybody asked was about the security situation here.\"\n\n\nBigelow's choice to film in Jordan met some resistance. In discussion, she found that her cast and crew shared stereotypes of the region from American culture. \"Sadly people in America and Los Angeles have these perceptions\", she said. \"But once you get off the plane you realize it's like Manhattan without the trees\", she continued. As Iraq dominated discourse in America and around the world, Bigelow believed that filmmakers would continue to explore the conflict, making Jordan the natural place to film.[15]\n\n\n\nAccording to producer Tony Mark, the blood, sweat and heat captured on-camera in the production was mirrored behind the scenes. \n\n\n> \"It's a tough, tough movie about a tough, tough subject\", Mark said in an interview, \"There was a palpable tension throughout on the set. It was just like the onscreen story of three guys who fight with each other, but when the time comes to do the work, they come together to get the job done.\"[16]\n> \n> \n\n Renner remembered, \"I got food bugs. Then I got food poisoning: lost 15 lbs in three days\".[11] In addition to the burden of the heat, the bomb suit he had to wear all day weighed 80–100 lb (36–45 kg).[17] In a scene in which his character carries a dead Iraqi boy, Renner fell down some stairs and twisted his ankle, which delayed filming because he could not walk. At that point, \"people wanted to quit. All the departments were struggling to get their job done, none of them were communicating\".[11] A week later, filming resumed.[11]\n\n\nTony Mark recalled the armorer David Fencl's finishing a 12-hour day. He found he had to stay up all night to make proper ammunition for a sniper rifle, as the supplies did not clear Jordanian customs in time for the scheduled shoot.[16] Due to import restrictions on military props, the film's special effects artist Richard Stutsman used Chinese fireworks for gunpowder. One day, he was assembling a prop, and the heat and friction caused the fireworks to blow up in his face. Two days later, he returned to work.[11] The film shoot had few of the normal Hollywood perks; nobody on the set got an air-conditioned trailer or a private bathroom.[16] Renner said that great care was taken to ensure the film's authenticity.[18] According to Renner, shooting the film in the Middle East contributed to this. \"There were two-by-fours with nails being dropped from two-story buildings that hit me in the helmet, and they were throwing rocks.... We got shot at a few times while we were filming\", Renner said. \"When you see it, you're gonna feel like you've been in war.\"[19]\n\n\n\n\n> \"You can't fake that amount of heat\", Mackie says, adding, \"When you are on set and all of the extras are Iraqi refugees, it really informs the movie that you're making. When you start hearing the stories from a true perspective ... of people who were actually there, it gives you a clear viewpoint of where you are as an artist and the story you would like to tell. It was a great experience to be there.\"[20]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Cinematography[edit]\n\n\nFor the film, director Bigelow sought to immerse audiences \"into something that was raw, immediate and visceral\". Impressed with cinematographer Barry Ackroyd's work on *United 93* and *The Wind That Shakes the Barley,* Bigelow invited him to work on her film. While the film was independently produced and filmed on a low budget, Bigelow used four Super 16 mm cameras to capture multiple perspectives, saying, \n\n\n\n\n> \"That's how we experience reality, by looking at the microcosm and the macrocosm simultaneously. The eye sees differently than the lens, but with multiple focal lengths and a muscular editorial style, the lens can give you that microcosm/macrocosm perspective and that contributes to the feeling of total immersion.\"[21]\n> \n> \n\n In staging the film's action sequences, Bigelow did not want to lose a sense of the geography and used multiple cameras to allow her to \"look at any particular set-piece from every possible perspective.\"[10]\n\n\n### Editing[edit]\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* was edited by Chris Innis and Bob Murawski.[22][23] The two editors worked with almost 200 hours of footage from the multiple hand-held cameras in use during the shoot.[23] Adding to the challenge, Boal's screenplay had a non-traditional, asymmetrical, episodic structure. There was no traditional \"villain\", and tension was derived from the characters' internal conflicts and the suspense from the explosives and snipers.[23]\n\n\n\n\n> \"This movie is kind of like a horror film where you're unable to see the killer,\" says Innis. \"You know a bomb could go off at any minute, but you never know just when it's going to happen, so the ideas of [Alfred] Hitchcock—about making your audience anxious—were influential for us when we did the editing.\"[24]\n> \n> \n\nThe raw footage was described as a \"hodge-podge of disconnected, nausea-inducing motion that was constantly crossing the 180-degree line\".[23]\n\n\nInnis spent the first eight weeks editing the film on location in Jordan, before returning to Los Angeles, where Murawski joined her. The process took over eight months to complete.[22][25] The goal was to edit a brutally realistic portrayal of the realities of war, using minimal special effects or technical enhancement.[22][23] Innis stated that they \"really wanted the film to retain that 'newsreel' documentary quality... Too many stage-y effects would have been distracting. The editing in this film was all about restraint\".[22]\n\n\nEditing on location led to additional complications in post-production. The production was unwilling to risk sending undeveloped film through high-security airports where the cans could be opened, X-rayed, or damaged. Accordingly, film was hand-carried on a flight by a production assistant from Amman to London. After the Super 16mm film was transferred to DVcam at a lab in London, the video dailies were transported by plane back to the Middle East to be imported into the editing system. The whole journey would take anywhere from three days to a week and was described by Innis as the \"modern-day equivalent of shipping via donkey cart.\"[23] The low production budget and the lack of a developed film infrastructure in the area hampered the process, according to Innis. \"We were working with grainy Super 16mm film, editing in standard definition. We tried doing FTP downloads, but at the time, the facilities in Jordan simply couldn't handle it.\"[22][23] Producer Tony Mark later negotiated the use of a local radio station late at night to receive low-grade QuickTime clips over the Internet so the crew would not be shooting blindly.[23]\n\n\n\n### Musical score and sound[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Hurt Locker (soundtrack)\n\nMarco Beltrami and Buck Sanders composed the score. Bigelow wanted Beltrami to score for the film, as she liked his critically acclaimed work in *3:10 to Yuma* (2007). Paul N. J. Ottosson worked on the film's sound design.[26] The score was released in June 2009 through Lakeshore Records.\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Festival screenings[edit]\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* had its world premiere at the Venice International Film Festival on September 4, 2008, and the film received a 10-minute standing ovation at the end of its screening.[27] At the festival, the film won the SIGNIS award,[28] the Arca Cinemagiovani Award (Arca Young Cinema Award) for \"Best Film Venezia 65\" (chosen by an international youth jury); the Human Rights Film Network Award; and the Venezia Cinema Award known as the \"Navicella\".[29] The film also screened at the 33rd Annual Toronto International Film Festival on September 8,[27] where it generated \"keen interest\", though distributors were reluctant to buy it since previous films about the Iraq War performed poorly at the box office.[30] Summit Entertainment purchased the film for distribution in the United States in what was perceived as \"a skittish climate for pic sales\".[31]\n\n\nIn the rest of 2008, *The Hurt Locker* screened at the 3rd Zurich Film Festival,[32] the 37th Festival du Nouveau Cinéma, the 21st Mar del Plata Film Festival,[33] the 5th Dubai International Film Festival, and the 12th Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival.[34] In 2009, *The Hurt Locker* screened at the Göteborg International Film Festival,[35] the 10th *Film Comment* Selects festival,[36] and the South by Southwest film festival.[37] It was the closing night film at Maryland Film Festival 2009, with Bigelow presenting. It had a centerpiece screening at the 3rd AFI Dallas International Film Festival, where director Kathryn Bigelow received the Dallas Star Award.[38] Other 2009 festivals included the Human Rights Nights International Film Festival,[39] the Seattle International Film Festival,[40] and the Philadelphia Film Festival.[41]\n\n\n\n### Theatrical run[edit]\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* was first publicly released in Italy by Warner Bros. on October 10, 2008.[27] Summit Entertainment picked the film up for distribution in the United States for $1.5 million after it was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival.[42]\n*The Hurt Locker* was released in the United States on June 26, 2009, with a limited release at four theaters in Los Angeles and New York City.[43] Over its first weekend the film grossed $145,352, averaging $36,338 per theater. The following weekend, beginning July 3, the film grossed $131,202 at nine theaters, averaging $14,578 per theater.[44] \nIt held the highest per-screen average of any film playing theatrically in the United States for the first two weeks of its release,[1] gradually moving into the top 20 chart with much wider-released, bigger budget studio films.[45] It held around number 13 or number 14 on box office charts for an additional four weeks. Summit Entertainment took *The Hurt Locker* wider to more than 200 screens on July 24, 2009, and more than 500 screens on July 31, 2009.\n\n\nThe film's final gross was $17,017,811 in the United States and Canada, and $32,212,961 in other countries, bringing its worldwide total to $49,230,772. It was a success against its budget of $15 million.[1]\n\n\nAccording to the *Los Angeles Times*, *The Hurt Locker* performed better than most recent dramas about Middle East conflict. The film outperformed all other Iraq-war-themed films such as *In the Valley of Elah* (2007), *Stop-Loss* (2008) and Afghanistan-themed *Lions for Lambs* (2007).[42]\n\n\nIn the United States, *The Hurt Locker* is one of only five Best Picture winners (*The English Patient*, *Amadeus*, *The Artist*, and *The Shape of Water* being the other four) to never enter the weekend box office top 5 since top 10 rankings were first recorded in 1982. It is also one of the only two Best Picture winners on record never to have entered the weekend box office top 10 (*The Artist* being the other).\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* opened in the top ten in the United Kingdom in 103 theaters, scoring the fourth-highest per-screen average of $3,607, ranking between *G-Force* and *G.I. Joe* in overall grosses. The film garnered half a million dollars in its opening weekend in the United Kingdom of August 28 through August 30, 2009,[46] and grossed over a million dollars in the UK, Japan, Spain, and France through March.[47]\n\n\n\n### Distribution: Independent film print shortage[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an article in the Springfield, Illinois *State Journal-Register*, as of August 2009, there was a shortage of film prints of *The Hurt Locker*, as well as other hit independent films such as *Food, Inc.*[48] Distributors told theater owners that they would have to wait weeks or months past the initial U.S. release date to get the few available prints that were already in distribution. \"Sometimes the distributors goof up,\" said a film buyer for one theater. \"They misjudge how wide they should go.\"[48] One theory is that the independent films have a hard time competing for screen space during the summer against blockbuster tent-pole films that take up as much as half the screens in any given city, flooding the United States market with thousands of prints. Theater owners have also complained about distributors \"bunching too many movies too close together\".[48][49] It is also thought that independent film distributors are trying to cut their losses on prints by recycling them. Given the popularity of some of the films that are \"hard to come by\", this strategy may be leaving box office money on the table.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* was released on DVD and Blu-ray in North America on January 12, 2010. This disc includes an added audio commentary featuring director Kathryn Bigelow, writer Mark Boal, and other members of the production crew; an image gallery of photos from shooting; and a 15-minute EPK featurette highlighting the filming experience in Jordan and the film's production. The UK DVD and Blu-ray have no commentary.\n\n\nOn February 22, 2022, two years after getting a digital 4K release, Lionsgate and Best Buy released a steelbook of the movie, marking the first time it came to 4K resolution.\nU.S. sales of the DVD topped $30 million by mid-August 2010.[50]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* received widespread acclaim, with Renner's performance receiving praise from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 97%, based on 290 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 8.5/10. It was the second highest-rated film of 2009, behind Pixar's *Up*. The critics' consensus reads, \"A well-acted, intensely shot, action filled war epic, Kathryn Bigelow's *The Hurt Locker* is thus far the best of the recent dramatizations of the Iraq War.\"[51] Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score, gave the film an average score of 95 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[52]\n\n\nRoger Ebert of *The Chicago Sun Times* rated the film as the best of 2009, writing, \"*The Hurt Locker* is a great film, an intelligent film, a film shot clearly so that we know exactly who everybody is and where they are and what they're doing and why.\" He applauded how the suspense was built, calling the film \"spellbinding\". Ebert considered Renner \"a leading contender for Academy Awards\", writing, \"His performance is not built on complex speeches but on a visceral projection of who this man is and what he feels. He is not a hero in a conventional sense.\"[53] He eventually ranked it the second-best film of the decade, behind only *Synecdoche, New York*.[54]\n\n\nRichard Corliss of *Time* magazine also spoke highly of Renner's performance, calling it a highlight of the film. Corliss wrote,\n\n\n\n\n> \"He's ordinary, pudgy-faced, quiet, and at first seems to lack the screen charisma to carry a film. That supposition vanishes in a few minutes, as Renner slowly reveals the strength, confidence and unpredictability of a young Russell Crowe. The merging of actor and character is one of the big things to love about this movie... It's a creepy marvel to watch James in action. He has the cool aplomb, analytical acumen and attention to detail of a great athlete, or a master psychopath, maybe both.\"[55]\n> \n> \n\nCorliss praised the film's \"steely calm\" tone, reflective of its main character. Corliss summarized, \"*The Hurt Locker* is a near-perfect movie about men in war, men at work. Through sturdy imagery and violent action, it says that even Hell needs heroes.\"[55]\n\n\nA. O. Scott of *The New York Times* called *The Hurt Locker* the best American feature film yet made about the war in Iraq: \n\n\n\n\n> \"You may emerge from *The Hurt Locker* shaken, exhilarated and drained, but you will also be thinking ... The movie is a viscerally exciting, adrenaline-soaked tour de force of suspense and surprise, full of explosions and hectic scenes of combat, but it blows a hole in the condescending assumption that such effects are just empty spectacle or mindless noise.\"[56]\n> \n> \n\nScott noticed that the film reserved criticism of the war but wrote of how the director handled the film's limits, \"Ms. Bigelow, practicing a kind of hyperbolic realism, distills the psychological essence and moral complications of modern warfare into a series of brilliant, agonizing set pieces.\" He also applauded the convergence of the characters in the film, saying that it \"focuses on three men whose contrasting temperaments knit this episodic exploration of peril and bravery into a coherent and satisfying story.\"[56] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that the performances of Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty would raise their profiles considerably, and said their characters reveal their \"unlooked-for aspects,\" such as Renner's character being playful with an Iraqi boy. Turan applauded Boal's \"lean and compelling\" script and said of Bigelow's direction, \"Bigelow and her team bring an awesome ferocity to re-creating the unhinged mania of bomb removal in an alien, culturally unfathomable atmosphere.\"[57]\n\n\nGuy Westwell of *Sight & Sound* wrote that the cinematographer Barry Ackroyd provided \"sharp handheld coverage\" and that Paul N.J. Ottosson's sound design \"uses the barely perceptible ringing of tinnitus to amp up the tension.\"[58] Westwell praised the director's skill:\n\n\n\n\n> \"The careful mapping of the subtle differences between each bomb, the play with point of view ... and the attenuation of key action sequences ... lends the film a distinctive quality that can only be attributed to Bigelow's clever, confident direction.\"[58]\n> \n> \n\nThe critic noted the film's different take on the Iraq War, writing that \"it confronts the fact that men often take great pleasure in war.\"[58] He concluded,\n\n\n\n> \"This unapologetic celebration of a testosterone-fuelled lust for war may gall. Yet there is something original and distinctive about the film's willingness to admit that for some men (and many moviegoers) war carries an intrinsic dramatic charge.\"[58]\n> \n> \n\n\nAmy Taubin of *Film Comment* described *The Hurt Locker* as \"a structuralist war movie\" and \"a totally immersive, off-the-charts high-anxiety experience from beginning to end.\" Taubin praised Ackroyd's \"brilliant\" cinematography with multiple viewpoints. She said of the film's editing, \"Bob Murawski and Chris Innis's editing is similarly quick and nervous; the rapid changes in POV as they cut from one camera's coverage to another's, makes you feel as if you, like the characters, are under threat from all sides.\"[59]\n\n\nJoe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* called it \"A first-rate action thriller, a vivid evocation of urban warfare in Iraq, a penetrating study of heroism and a showcase for austere technique, terse writing and a trio of brilliant performances.\"[60] The *Toronto Star* critic Peter Howell said, \"Just when you think the battle of Iraq war dramas has been fought and lost, along comes one that demands to be seen... If you can sit through *The Hurt Locker* without your heart nearly pounding through your chest, you must be made of granite.\"[61] *Entertainment Weekly'*s film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film the rare \"A\" rating, calling it, \"an intense, action-driven war pic, a muscular, efficient standout that simultaneously conveys the feeling of combat from within as well as what it looks like on the ground. This ain't no war videogame.\"[62]\n\n\nDerek Elley of *Variety* found *The Hurt Locker* to be \"gripping\" as a thriller but felt that the film was weakened by, \"its fuzzy (and hardly original) psychology.\" Elley wrote that it was unclear to know where the drama lay: \"These guys get by on old-fashioned guts and instinct rather than sissy hardware—but it's not a pure men-under-stress drama either.\" The critic also felt that the script showed \"signs of artificially straining for character depth.\"[63] Anne Thompson, also writing for *Variety*, believed *The Hurt Locker* to be a contender for Best Picture, particularly based on the unique subject matter pursued by a female director and on being an exception to other films about the Iraq War, which had performed poorly.[64]\n\n\nTara McKelvey from *The American Prospect* wrote that the film is pro-U.S. Army propaganda, although it suggests it is anti-war with the opening statement: \"War is a drug.\" She continues,\n\n\n\n\n> \"You feel empathy for the soldiers when they shoot. And in this way, the full impact of the Iraq war—at least as it was fought in 2004—becomes clear: American soldiers shot at Iraqi civilians even when, for example, they just happened to be holding a cell phone and standing near an IED.\" She concludes, \"For all the graphic violence, bloody explosions and, literally, human butchery that is shown in the film, *The Hurt Locker* is one of the most effective recruiting vehicles for the U.S. Army that I have seen.\"[65]\n> \n> \n\n\nJohn Pilger, journalist and documentarian, criticized the film in the *New Statesman*, writing that it \"offers a vicarious thrill via yet another standard-issue psychopath high on violence in somebody else's country where the deaths of a million people are consigned to cinematic oblivion.\"[66]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Independent Film & Television Alliance selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years.[67]\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* was named the tenth \"Best Film of the 21st Century So Far\" in 2017 by *The New York Times* chief film critics A. O. Scott and Manohla Dargis.[68]\n\n\n\n### Response among veterans[edit]\n\n\nThe film was criticized by some Iraq veterans and embedded reporters for inaccurately portraying wartime conditions.[69] Writing for *The Huffington Post*, Iraq veteran Kate Hoit said that *The Hurt Locker* is \"Hollywood's version of the Iraq war and of the soldiers who fight it, and their version is inaccurate.\" She described the film as being \"better than a lot of the recent war movies that have been released\" but expressed concerns that several errors—among them wrong uniforms, lack of radio communication, or misbehavior of the soldiers—would alienate service members from enjoying the film.[70]\n\n\nAuthor Brandon Friedman, also a combat veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, shared a similar view at *VetVoice*: \"*The Hurt Locker* is a high-tension, well-made, action movie that will certainly keep most viewers on the edges of their seats. But if you know anything about the Army, or about operations or life in Iraq, you'll be so distracted by the nonsensical sequences and plot twists that it will ruin the movie for you. It certainly did for me.\" Friedman criticized the inaccuracy of the film's representation of combat, saying, \"in real life, EOD techs don't conduct dangerous missions as autonomous three-man teams without communications gear ... Another thing you'll rarely hear in combat is an EOD E-7 suggesting to two or three of his guys that they leave the scene of an explosion in an Iraqi city by saying: 'C'mon, let's split up. We can cover more ground that way.'\"[71]\n\n\nAt the blog *Army of Dude*, infantryman and Iraq veteran Alex Horton noted that \"the way the team goes about their missions is completely absurd.\" He still generally enjoyed it and called it \"the best Iraq movie to date.\"[72]\n\n\nTroy Steward, another combat veteran, wrote on the blog *Bouhammer* that while the film accurately depicted the scale of bomb violence and the relations between Iraqis and troops, \"just about everything else wasn't realistic.\" Steward went on to say: \"I was amazed that a movie so bad could get any kind of accolades from anyone.\"[73]\n\n\nA review published March 8, 2010, in the *Air Force Times* cited overall negative reviews from bomb experts in Iraq attached to the 4th Brigade, 1st Armored Division, quoting a bomb disposal team leader who called the film's portrayal of a bomb expert \"grossly exaggerated and not appropriate,\" and describing the lead character as \"more of a run and gun cowboy type … exactly the kind of person that we're not looking for.\"[74] Another bomb disposal team member said that the lead character's \"swagger would put a whole team at risk. Our team leaders don't have that kind of invincibility complex, and if they do, they aren't allowed to operate. A team leader's first priority is getting his team home in one piece.\"[74]\n\n\nOn the embedded side, former correspondent for *The Politico* and *Military Times* Christian Lowe (who embedded with U.S. military units each year from 2002 to 2005) explained at *DefenseTech*: \"Some of the scenes are so disconnected with reality to be almost parody.\"[75]\n\n\nFormer British bomb disposal officer Guy Marot said, \"James makes us look like hot-headed, irrational adrenaline junkies with no self-discipline. It’s immensely disrespectful to the many officers who have lost their lives.\"[76]\n\n\nOn the other hand, Henry Engelhardt, an adjutant with the National Explosive Ordnance Disposal Association having twenty years' experience in bomb defusal, complimented the film's atmosphere and depiction of the difficulties of the job, saying, \"Of course, no film is realistic in all its details, but the important things were done very well.\"[77]\n\n\n\n### Top ten lists[edit]\n\n\n*The Hurt Locker* was listed on many critics' top ten lists.[78]\n\n\n\n* 1st – David Ansen, *Newsweek*\n* 1st – J.

It also ranked on more film critics' top 10 lists than any other film of 2009. It was nominated in nine categories at the 82nd Academy Awards and won in six: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Film Editing. It lost the award for Best Actor to *Crazy Heart*, Best Original Score to *Up*, and Best Cinematography to *Avatar*.[81] Bigelow became the first woman to win an Oscar for Best Director.[82]\n\n\nKathryn Bigelow was awarded the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Achievement in Feature Film for the film, being only one of three women to do so along with Chloe Zhao for *Nomadland* and Jane Campion for *The Power of the Dog*.[83] The film won six awards at the BAFTAs held on February 21, 2010, including Best Film and Best Director for Bigelow. *The Hurt Locker* was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards.[84]\n\n\nThe Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association Award for Best Director was given to Kathryn Bigelow, the first time the honor has gone to a woman. The film swept most critics groups awards for Best Director and Best Picture, including Chicago, Boston, and Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York' film critics group associations. *The Hurt Locker* is one of only six films that have won all three major U.S. critics group prizes (LA, NY, NSFC), together with *Goodfellas*, *Schindler's List*, *L.A. Confidential*, *The Social Network,* and *Drive My Car*; and also the second to win Best Picture after *Schindler's List*.\n\n\nThe five awards from the Boston Society of Film Critics were the most by that organization to a single film in the group's 30-year history.[85]\n\n\nIn February 2010, the film's producer Nicolas Chartier emailed a group of Academy Award voters in an attempt to sway them to vote for *The Hurt Locker* instead of \"a $500M film\" (referring to *Avatar*) for the Best Picture award. He later issued a public apology, saying that it was \"out of line and not in the spirit of the celebration of cinema that this acknowledgment is\".[86] The Academy banned him from attending the award ceremony, the first time the academy has ever banned an individual nominee.[87]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits[edit]\n\n\n### Sarver lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn early March 2010, U.S. Army bomb disposal expert Master Sergeant Jeffrey Sarver filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against *The Hurt Locker*. Sarver's lawsuit claimed he used the term \"hurt locker\" and the phrase \"war is a drug\" around Boal, that his likeness was used to create the character William James, and that the portrayal of James defames Sarver.[88] Sarver said he felt \"just a little bit hurt, a little bit felt left out\" and cheated out of \"financial participation\" in the film.[89] Sarver claimed he originated the title of the film; however, according to the film's website, the title is a decades-old colloquialism for being injured, as in \"they sent him to the hurt locker.\"[90] It dates back to the Vietnam War where it was one of several phrases meaning \"in trouble or at a disadvantage; in bad shape.\"[91]\n\n\nBoal defended himself to the press, saying \"the film is a work of fiction inspired by many people's stories.\"[89] He said he talked to more than 100 soldiers during his research.[92] Jody Simon, a Los Angeles-based entertainment lawyer, noted that \"soldiers don't have privacy,\" and that when the military embedded Boal they gave him full permission to use his observations as he saw fit. Summit Entertainment, the producers of the film, said in early March that they hoped for a quick resolution to the suit.[89] In the December 8, 2011, issue of *The Hollywood Reporter*, it was announced that the court threw out Sarver's lawsuit. A federal judge ordered him to pay more than $180,000 in attorney fees.[93]\n\n\n\n### Copyright infringement lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nOn May 12, 2010, Voltage Pictures, the production company behind *The Hurt Locker*, announced that it would attempt to sue \"potentially tens of thousands\" of online computer users who downloaded unlicensed copies of the film using the BitTorrent and P2P networks. It would be the largest lawsuit of its kind.[94][95] On May 28, 2010, it filed a complaint against 5,000 unidentified BitTorrent users in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia; Voltage announced its intention to demand $1,500 from each defendant to release him or her from the suit.[96] Several people, however, refused to settle with the studio.[97] The US Copyright Group (USCG) has since dropped all cases against the alleged *Hurt Locker* downloaders.[98]\n\n\nOn August 29, 2011, the Federal Court of Canada ordered three Canadian ISPs—Bell Canada, Cogeco, and Vidéotron—to disclose the names and addresses of the subscribers whose IP addresses were suspected of having downloaded a copy of the film. The ISPs were given two weeks to comply with the order.[99]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"*The Hurt Locker* (2009)\". Box Office Mojo.

It was written by Iñárritu, Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris Jr., and Armando Bó. The film stars Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson, a faded Hollywood actor best known for playing the superhero \"Birdman\", as he struggles to mount a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story, \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\". The film's supporting cast includes Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts.\n\n\nThe film covers the period of previews leading to the play's opening. With a brief exception, it appears as if it was filmed in a single shot, an idea Iñárritu had from the film's conception. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki believed that the recording time necessary for the long take approach could not have been made with older technology. The film was shot in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million, jointly financed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, Regency Enterprises and Worldview Entertainment. It premiered the following year in August, when it opened the 71st Venice International Film Festival.\n\n\n*Birdman* had a limited theatrical release in the United States on October 17, 2014, followed by a wide release on November 14. Grossing more than $103 million worldwide, the film received critical acclaim, with praise for its screenplay, direction, cinematography, and the performances of the cast (particularly Keaton, Norton, and Stone). *Birdman* won the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography from a total of nine nominations, tying it with *The Grand Budapest Hotel* for the most nominated and awarded film at the 87th Academy Awards. It also won Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Keaton and Best Screenplay at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nRiggan Thomson is a faded actor famous for playing a superhero named Birdman in a film trilogy from 1989 to 1992. He is tormented by the mocking and critical internal voice of his past self as Birdman and frequently visualizes himself performing feats of levitation and telekinesis. Riggan is trying to regain recognition by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story, \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\" However, the Birdman voice wants Riggan to return to blockbuster cinema and insists that he is essential to Riggan's identity.\n\n\nJake, Riggan's best friend and lawyer, is producing the play, which co-stars Riggan's girlfriend, Laura, and Broadway débutante Lesley. Riggan's daughter Sam, a recovering drug addict with whom he is trying to reconnect, is working as his assistant. The day before the first preview, a light fixture falls onto Riggan's hapless co-star, Ralph. At Lesley's suggestion, Riggan replaces Ralph with her boyfriend, the brilliant but volatile and self-absorbed method actor Mike Shiner.\n\n\nThe first previews are disastrous: Mike breaks character over replacing his gin with water, attempts to rape Lesley during a sex scene, and complains that the prop gun does not look natural. Riggan clashes continually with Mike, culminating in a brawl after Riggan reads a *New York Times* interview with Mike in which he steals Riggan's personal reason for doing a Raymond Carver play. Jake persuades Riggan to continue with the play. When Riggan berates Sam after finding her using marijuana, she insultingly rebukes and chastises him, telling him he is irrelevant, and the play is for his own vanity.\n\n\nDuring the final preview, after seeing Mike and Sam kissing backstage, Riggan accidentally locks himself outside with his robe stuck in the fire escape door. He is forced to walk through Times Square in his briefs and enter through the audience to do the final scene. A concerned Sam is waiting in his dressing room after the show, and she thinks the performance was very unusual but interesting. She shows him that the Times Square footage is going viral and explains how this actually helps him.\n\n\nRiggan goes to a bar for a drink and approaches Tabitha Dickinson, a cynical and highly influential theater critic. She promises to \"kill\" his play with a deprecating review without seeing it. On the way back, Riggan buys a pint of whiskey, drinks it, and passes out on a stoop. The next day, walking to the theater with a severe hangover, he visualizes Birdman trying to convince him to abandon the play and make a fourth Birdman film. Riggan then imagines himself flying through the streets of Manhattan before arriving at the theater.\n\n\nOn opening night, the play goes very well. In his dressing room, a strangely calm Riggan confesses to his ex-wife, Sylvia, that several years ago, he attempted to drown himself in the ocean after she caught him having an affair. He also tells her about the Birdman voice, which she ignores. After Sylvia leaves, Riggan picks up a real gun for the final scene in which his character commits suicide. At the climax, Riggan shoots himself in the head on stage. The play receives a standing ovation.\n\n\nRiggan wakes up in a hospital—the suicide attempt merely blew off his nose, which has been surgically reconstructed. Tabitha has published a glowing review of the play, mistaking the suicide attempt for a new acting technique. Sam visits with flowers and takes a picture of him to share with the skyrocketing number of followers on the Twitter account she has created for him.\n\n\nWhile she steps outside to find a vase, Riggan goes into the bathroom, removes the bandages revealing his swollen new nose, and says goodbye to Birdman, seen seated on the toilet. Fascinated by the birds flying outside his room, he opens the window, peers up at them, and then climbs out onto the ledge. Sam returns to an empty room and frantically runs to the open window, scanning the ground before slowly looking up into the sky and smiling at what she sees.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson\n\t+ Benjamin Kanes as Young Riggan / Birdman\n* Zach Galifianakis as Jake\n* Edward Norton as Mike Shiner\n* Andrea Riseborough as Laura Alburn\n* Amy Ryan as Sylvia Thomson\n* Emma Stone as Sam Thomson\n* Naomi Watts as Lesley Truman\n* Lindsay Duncan as Tabitha Dickinson\n* Merritt Wever as Annie\n* Jeremy Shamos as Ralph\n* Bill Camp as Crazy Man\n* Damian Young as Gabriel\n* Michael Siberry as Larry\n* Clark Middleton as Sydney\n* Paula Pell as Lady in Bar\n* David Fierro as Man in Bar\n* Donna Lynne Champlin as Broadway Lady\n* Craig muMs Grant as Broadway Man\n* Jackie Hoffman as Mary Lady on Balcony\n* Susan Blackwell as Intermission Woman\n* Stephen Adly Guirgis as Good Neighbor\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n*Birdman* director Alejandro G. Iñárritu originally conceived the film as a comedy filmed in a single shot set in a theatre. The original choice behind the film's genre, which was subsequently re-adapted to concentrate on Riggan's final emotional tailspin, came from the director wanting to see a change in his approach. All his previous films were dramas, and after directing *Biutiful*, he did not want to approach his new film in the same tragic manner again.[4] The decision to make the film appear as a single shot came from his realization that \"we live our lives with no editing\". By presenting the film as a continuous shot, he could \"submerge the protagonist in an 'inescapable reality' and take the audience with him\".[5] Iñárritu shared his idea with the Argentine screenwriters/cousins Nicolás Giacobone and Armando Bo, as well as playwright Alexander Dinelaris, Jr., who had all worked with him on his previous film.[6][a] Their first reaction was to tell him the continuous-shot idea could not work.[4] According to Dinelaris and Giacobone, \"huge\" and \"important\" people told him to not even try the project for the same reason.[6] Iñárritu himself described the technique as \"almost suicidal\", worrying that it would be distracting, instead of immersive.[8] Dinelaris later said that had they truly paused and considered the idea, they might have talked Iñárritu out of it.[4]\n\n\nThe personal and vocational experiences of the four co-writers were central to writing the script. Dinelaris' exposure to Broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage, though he admitted exaggerating these. He also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film \"were really more like play scenes\".[6] Iñárritu's own experiences influenced many of *Birdman*'s themes. \"What this film talks about, I have been through\", Iñárritu recalled. \"I have seen and experienced all of it; it's what I have been living through the last years of my life.\"[4] Dinelaris described this aspect as \"a laughing look at oneself\", but said it had to be done in a comedic way; otherwise, \"it would have been the most unbelievably self-absorbed look at the subject\".[4] Themes from Raymond Carver's short story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\", which Riggan adapts for stage in the story, also influenced the script. Iñárritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in Riggan's story and those of Carver's.[6] Because of this, it was important to the director that Carver's story be the subject of the play depicted within the film. Therefore, Iñárritu stated that his desire to use Carver's work was \"terrifying\" because the rights to using the Carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film, but no issues arose. Carver's widow, writer Tess Gallagher, loved the script and permitted the adaptation, saying that Carver would be laughing about the film.[4]\n\n\nWhile some aspects of the film – the first frame with Riggan, for instance – went unchanged from *Birdman's* conception to release,[4] others went through several iterations. One of these was the sequence in which alter ego Birdman takes complete control over Riggan's thoughts. The writers knew it would occur at Riggan's lowest point, so at one stage planned for it to happen after Riggan hears the initial negative press coverage and destroys his dressing room. In another discarded version, Riggan tries to drown himself in Central Park and flies out to save himself.[6]\n\n\nThe film's ending also changed, the final version being written halfway through filming.[9] The original intended to depict Johnny Depp in Riggan's dressing room with a *Pirates of the Caribbean* poster in the back. Iñárritu grew to strongly dislike this ending, calling it \"so embarrassing\", and rewrote it with Dinelaris and Giacobone after a new ending came to him in a dream.[9][10] Iñárritu was reluctant to describe the original ending, but it was leaked by Dinelaris. He said the original ending was set in the theatre, instead of the hospital, and involved Depp putting on Riggan Thomson's wig, and in Jack Sparrow's voice, \"... the poster asks Depp, 'What the fuck are we doing here, mate?', and it was going to be the satire of the endless loop of that.\"[11] The director and co-authors ruled out the satirical ending, and favored the new, more ambiguous, ending.[10][11][12]\n\n\nThe project of co-writing was expedited by the collaboration between the four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails.[4] Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in *Birdman* came from Skype sessions at two in the morning where he and Giacobone were \"cracking each other up\". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said: \"We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting\". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be \"very, very sure about what was on the page\".[6] As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft.[13] As Dinelaris summarized: \"You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot. You have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. *Birdman* looks like a good idea now, but [at the time of production] we did not know how we would land.\"[6]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Keaton was Iñárritu's first choice to play Riggan Thomson.\nIñárritu cast several of the leading roles before the film was financed.[2] Among these was the lead role. Early in script development, Iñárritu did not have Keaton in mind,[5] but he had changed his mind by the end: \"When I finished the script, I knew that Michael was not the choice or option, he was the guy\".[14] Iñárritu cast Keaton for his depth in a variety of acting styles: He could handle the demands of the stage, up-close work, and comedy and empathy \"with a profound depth to both\".[15]\n\n\nKeaton knew about *Birdman* before Iñárritu contacted him. He was in the middle of production of another project when he learned that Iñárritu was making another film. Keaton, a fan of his work, flew home to find out more.[16] Iñárritu sent him the script and they discussed it over dinner. The first thing Keaton asked the director was whether he was making fun of him (regarding his role in Tim Burton's *Batman* films), but after Iñárritu explained the role, its technicalities, and the film's production, Keaton agreed to play Riggan. Despite this, the final film contains numerous references to Burton's *Batman* films, including the year Riggan is mentioned to have last played Birdman being 1992.[5]\n\n\nIñárritu called his decision behind casting Galifianakis as Jake \"a bet\". Galifianakis met the director's criteria of being lovable and funny, but Iñárritu also considered him sensitive, which scored him the role.[17] Emma Stone already knew she wanted to work with Iñárritu before she was offered the role of Sam. The script that Iñárritu gave her and the rest of the cast came with the photo *Man on Wire*, which featured Philippe Petit crossing the Twin Towers on a tightrope. Iñárritu told the cast, \"We are doing that\".[10][18]\n\n\nOnce these actors were committed, Iñárritu sought funding. He first invited Fox Searchlight Pictures to finance the project, but they turned his offer down because they felt his asking budget was too high.[2] At one stage Megan Ellison of Annapurna Pictures wanted to be involved in the project, but decided against it because, unlike her other films, she had not been involved since the beginning.[19] Iñárritu approached Brad Weston, president of New Regency, who accepted the offer.[20] When executive Claudia Lewis of Searchlight heard about the deal, she reconsidered and asked to be included in the deal. Searchlight and New Regency had previously worked together to finance *12 Years a Slave*, and they decided to join together for *Birdman*, financing a budget of $16.5 million.[2]\n\n\nWeston and Lewis developed a close relationship with Iñárritu, editing the script with him and switching some of the actors. When they joined production, Josh Brolin was set to play the role of Mike Shiner, but the financiers decided to switch him for Norton because of scheduling conflicts.[2]\n\n\nHe said Norton's experience as a theatre actor, combined with his self-confidence, meant that \"in a way, there was some kind of mental reality to Edward\",[17] but Norton believes he was the one who convinced Iñárritu to take him on. Norton was a fan of the director's work and impressed with his ability to push outside film-making boundaries.[21] Norton heard about Iñárritu's project from a friend. Once he got the script, he read it straight through until 3:00 am. Norton said, \"I laughed so hard I woke people up.\"[22] Norton wanted to meet Iñárritu the next day, and once they met, Norton told him he could not cast someone who was the \"embodiment\" of what the script was taking aim at. Instead, the director needed to cast someone \"who has at least a little bit of authentic depth of experience, in this world\". Iñárritu agreed.[23]\n\n\nAmy Ryan, one of the last actors to be cast,[24] was invited because Iñárritu had seen her in the play *Detroit*.[25] Lindsay Duncan had vast experience in the theatre world too, and decided to accept the offer to play the critic because of the quality of the script. \"It's delicious because of the writing.\"[26] But like Shiner's character, Iñárritu found casting Laura difficult. Riseborough met him on a street corner for a cup of tea, and recalling the event, said, \"I told him that I would crawl across hot coals to work with him\".[27] Iñárritu described Laura as \"a very wacky, quirky role\", but said, \"when [Andrea Riseborough] did it, I knew that it was her, because she did it right in the tone, and she understood who she was – she was not judging\".[17]\n\n\n\n### Rehearsal and filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Keaton rehearsing an action-sequence of the film.\nOnce the writing was finished, Iñárritu contacted friend and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki to discuss his idea for the film.[28] After reading the script, Lubezki was worried that Iñárritu would offer him the job since *Birdman* \"had all of the elements of a movie that I did not want to do at all\" – comedy, studio work and long takes – but changed his mind after further discussion with the director.[29] The pair had worked together on commercials and a short film in the anthology *To Each His Own Cinema*,[30] but not on any feature films. Lubezki wanted to be sure that this was a decision Rodrigo Prieto, cinematographer of all four of Iñárritu's feature films, was comfortable with, but after receiving his blessing, the two headed into pre-production.[29]\n\n\nLubezki was concerned that no film had been shot in the way Iñárritu envisioned, meaning there would be no reference material to look up. The two decided the only way to learn how to shoot it would be to shoot it themselves, so they built a proxy stage at Sony Studios in Los Angeles.[28][31] The setup was minimal. Canvas and C-stands were used for walls, while tape and a few pieces of furniture marked out areas.[28][32] Using a camera and some stand-ins, the duo worked through the movie to see if it was possible.[28] Realizing no theatre could accommodate the intricate camerawork they needed, they hired Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York.[33] Still, Iñárritu wanted to shoot at a Broadway theater, but would have to wait until several weeks into rehearsals before securing St. James Theatre.[34] They then spent a few months designing and making \"blueprints\" of the shots and blocking the scenes, using the stand-ins to read and walk through the script.[29] The planning was precise. Iñárritu said: \"There was no room to improvise at all. Every movement, every line, every door opening, absolutely everything was rehearsed.\"[31] The actors started rehearsing once this preliminary work was completed: According to Lubezki, they did the scenes with the actors \"once we kind of knew what the rhythm of the scenes were\". He described the atypical approach \"like an upside down movie where you do post-production before the production\".[28]\n\n\n\n\n> I know Alejandro is very adamant about kind of keeping the rabbit in the hat and not being super specific about how it was shot, but I will say it took a lot of rehearsal and it was very specific... There was no luxury of cutting away or editing around anything. You knew that every scene was staying in the movie, and like theater, this was it, this was your chance to live this scene.\n> \n> — Emma Stone[35]\n> \n\n\nEditors Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione were involved in the project by this stage. When Iñárritu told Mirrione that he planned for Lubezki to record table readings and the rehearsals, he suggested they edit them immediately to discover what was and was not working early on.[36] The editing also allowed the editors to discuss pacing issues with the director,[37][38] such as the position of the night-day transitions and other moments of rest in the film.[36] Production designer Kevin Thompson was on hand too, and mapped out the scenes.[34] The camerawork required many elements of the set to be built in a certain way. For example, Riggan's makeup mirror and desk were constructed so that the camera would see his reflection.[32] Thompson also took into consideration the needs of the crew, for instance designing the stairs a little wider for Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff's footsize.[39]\nHe then constructed a template of the set they would build when in New York.[34] The writers were also involved in the rehearsals, fine-tuning the script to \"make sure the film was fluid and never stopped\".[13]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSt. James Theatre and Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York were used to film the stage and backstage scenes of *Birdman*, respectively.\n\nOnce the logistics of the scenes were worked out and they had the timing down, the team headed to Kaufman Studios for more rehearsals, followed by principal photography based exclusively in New York during the spring of 2013.[40] The studios were used to film the backstage areas of the film, including Riggan's dressing room and the theatre corridors. St. James Theatre was used for two weeks; it was the location for the stage scenes.[41] The bar segments were shot in The Rum House on 47th Street,[42] and 43rd Street was used for the action-sequence.[43] The film was unable to be shot chronologically because of scheduling with the theatre.[44] Throughout the locations, including the studio, the scenes were lit with natural light,[b] since Lubezki wanted the movie \"to look as naturalistic as possible\". The night-time scenes were possible to film in this way due to the brightness of New York.[29] Lubezki found lighting the scenes to be the hardest part of his work on the film. Not only did the lighting need to look realistic, but also had to be designed so that the continuous movements of the camera did not project the crew's shadows onto the actors.[28]\n\n\nThroughout shooting, Arri Alexa cameras were used; an Alexa M was used for handheld sequences, and an Alexa XT was attached to the Steadicam. Neither used matte boxes, however. Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff explained this decision: \"We didn't want this big black thing gliding into their eyeline. This way we could get very close and get the light past the lens and onto the actor's face.\"[39] Lubezki – who did all the handheld camerawork[28] – had chosen the Alexa M because the camera was very small and allowed him to get into tiny spaces and close to the actors,[29] sometimes filming two inches (5 cm) away from Keaton's face.[32] The camera also allowed recording for such a long period – necessary for the long takes of the movie – that Lubezki went so far as to say the movie would have been impossible to do years before.[29] The cameras were lensed with Leica Summilux-C or Zeiss Master Primes.[39] Lubezki stated that these gave clean images, saying \"You can have all these lights in the frame and they are not really causing bad flare or things like that\".[29] In terms of sizes, they initially trialled a 21mm, but this did not give Iñárritu the \"intimacy\" he wanted. The crew instead went to an 18mm Leica, which was used for the majority of the film. Only when emphasis was needed did they switch the lens to a 14mm, but this was rare.[39]\n\n\nDespite all the preparation, a typical shooting day would begin with rehearsals. These usually lasted most of the morning, after which photography followed.[44] The meticulous timing for the scenes meant that takes were cancelled because of the slightest mishaps. Emma Stone, in an interview with Jimmy Fallon, recalled how a six-minute take of the scene where Riggan first meets Mike was ruined after she walked around a corner too quickly.[45] Takes were also repeated if a scene's rhythm did not feel right to Iñárritu, or if he and Lubezki were not satisfied with a shot's framing.[28] As shooting progressed, lines of dialog would also be dropped, giving Iñárritu more options during post-production.[36] Because of this, the number of takes for a given scene was high, usually 20 for the shorter scenes,[28] the takes running smoothly around the fifteenth.[39] Chris Haarhoff described it as \"a type of dance where everyone would hopefully try to peak all at the same moment\". The locations sometimes placed restrictions on the takes too; the live Times Square sequence was shot only twice since they did not want to attract the attention of tourists.[28]\n\n\nWhenever shooting was taking place there was pressure on everyone involved, but the cast had a positive experience. Norton said that normally in movie production half the people can \"check out\" due to repetitive aspects, but during the shooting of *Birdman*, \"everybody's on, the whole thing, and you're all on pins and needles because you're all relying on forty other people not to drop the ball\". Because of this, Stone said the director was able to get the best out of the cast, saying Iñárritu's process \"creates this sort of fury in you, and then you end up realizing that he just got so much out of you that you didn't even know you had\".[18] Naomi Watts commented that the atmosphere \"felt emblematic of how it feels onstage – at least my long-time memories from long ago\".[46] Andrea Riseborough, meanwhile, described the process as \"wonderful\", mentioning how it was possible to hear the filming of a sequence from far away before the camera arrived, and then \"the magic happens with you, and then everything leaves you, and everything's silent\".[35] Once they successfully completed a take though, it was obvious to everybody involved. Norton said: \"I've never, ever been on a set where every day ended with an enormous, authentic sort of cheer at having made it. You're waiting for the scream from [Iñárritu], and everybody was genuinely excited.\"[21]\n\n\n\n### Music and soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Birdman (soundtrack)\n\nThe film's original music segments are a drum score consisting entirely of solo jazz percussion performances by Antonio Sánchez. The score is offset by a number of well-known classical music pieces, including Mahler and Tchaikovsky. Iñárritu did not regard the particular choice of classical pieces as important.[47] Nonetheless, the choice of classical music was strongly oriented to highly melodic scores taken predominantly from the 19th century classical repertoire (Mahler, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Ravel). Iñárritu stated that the classical components come from the world of the play, citing the radio in Riggan's room and the show itself as two sources of the music.[48] The classical music segments also included two compositions by American composer John Adams. Several jazz compositions by Victor Hernández Stumpfhauser and Joan Valent counterbalance the original music composition by Sánchez. The drum sections comprise the majority of the score, however, and were composed by Sánchez. Iñárritu explained the choice by saying they helped to structure scenes, and that \"The drums, for me, was a great way to find the rhythm of the film... In comedy, rhythm is king, and not having the tools of editing to determine time and space, I knew I needed something to help me find the internal rhythm of the film.\"[49][50]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jazz drummer Antonio Sánchez composed and recorded the score for the film.\nIñárritu contacted friend and jazz drummer Antonio Sánchez in January 2013, inviting him to compose the score for the film.[51] His reaction to writing a soundtrack using only drums was similar to Lubezki's thoughts of shooting the movie like a single shot: \"It was a scary proposition because I had no point of reference of how to achieve this. There's no other movie I know that has a score like this.\"[52] Sánchez had also not worked on a film before,[51] nevertheless, after receiving the script, he composed \"rhythmic themes\" for each of the characters.[53] Iñárritu was looking for the opposite approach, however, preferring spontaneity and improvisation.[54] Sánchez then waited until production moved to New York before composing more,[53] where he visited the set for a couple of days to get a better idea of the film.[54] Following this, a week before principal photography, he and Iñárritu went to a studio to record some demos.[48][55] During these sessions the director would first talk him through the scene, then while Sánchez was improvising guide him by raising his hand to indicate an event – such as a character opening a door – or by describing the rhythm with verbal sounds.[55][56] They recorded around seventy demos,[53] which Iñárritu used to inform the pacing of the scenes on set,[28] and once filming was complete, spliced them into the rough cut.[55] Sánchez summarized the process by saying, \"The movie fed on the drums, and the drums fed on the imagery\".[54] The official soundtrack was released as a CD (77 min) in October 2014, and as an LP (69 min) in April 2015.[57]\nWhen the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences released their longlist for the Academy Award for Best Original Score in December 2014, *Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)* was absent from the list. The previous day, Sánchez received a note from the award committee explaining the decision, quoting rule fifteen of the 87th Academy Award Rules, noting \"the fact that the film also contains over a half an hour of non-original (mostly classical) music cues that are featured very prominently in numerous pivotal moments in the film made it difficult for the committee to accept your submission\". Sánchez launched an appeal, and along with Iñárritu and the executive vice-president of Fox Music, they sent letters to Charles Fox, the chair of the Academy's music branch executive committee, asking that the committee reconsider their decision.[58] One of the points they raised was that the committee incorrectly calculated the ratio of classical to original music, which after being clarified Sánchez thought he was \"on really solid ground\".[59] A response from Fox on December 19, however, explained that a special meeting of the music committee was held, and although its members had \"great respect\" for the score and considered it \"superb\", they thought that the classical music \"was also used as scoring\", \"equally contributes to the effectiveness of the film\", and that the musical identity of the film was created by both the drums and classical music. Ultimately, they did not overturn their decision.[58] Sánchez said that he and Iñárritu were not satisfied with the explanation.[59]\n\n\n\n### Post-production and visual effects[edit]\n\n\n*Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)* was edited by Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione, who had both worked with the director before on *21 Grams* and *Babel*. Stitching shots together was, of course, a crucial component of the editing, but Crise and Mirrione already had experience doing this. The director had included takes that were joined together in previous films, but in these if the editors didn't think the stitching worked, they had the ability to introduce cuts. Mirrione said that in *Birdman* Iñárritu had \"let go of that safety net\".[38] Because of this the editors needed to be involved in the project early on,[37] and during principal photography Crise was on set every day. (Mirrione was busy and unable to be in New York.)[36] Crise was not used to being on set and providing feedback, but said he was happy Iñárritu \"dragged it out\" of him, knowing that they wouldn't have much room to fix scenes later so they needed to get them right.[36] For stitching, aside from the director, Crise also discussed strategies with Lubezki and Thompson, and techniques for gluing takes together included panning on walls and actors' bodies.[60] The editors were used to being able to adjust the rhythm of a scene by the positioning of cuts, so without this tool used Sánchez's music instead. The director gave the New York recordings to Crise early on to help with pacing, asking him to cut the music to the film. Still, in terms of the editing workflow, Crise described it as \"pretty traditional\". The editors cut the film together back in Los Angeles.[36] A few weeks after shooting, they were quite far along the cut itself, and transitioned into visual-effects mode, where they fine-tuned the shots.[44]\n\n\n\n\n> They always talk about how when you're cutting a dance scene, a choreographer wouldn't want any cuts because she's designing something to see the whole movement, and that's what Alejandro was doing here.\n> \n> — Stephen Mirrione[37]\n> \n\n\nThe visual effects for the film were created by Montreal based studio Rodeo FX. They spent four months working on the film,[61] and according to visual effects supervisor Ara Khanikian \"visual effects touched 90% of the frames in the movie\".[62] A lot of the work was subtle, such as stitching shots together, or creating the background for the windows in the hospital scene.[62] Many shots in the film feature mirrors, and much work was spent removing the reflections of the crew from these. To accomplish this the studio created a 2.5D digital matte painting of the reflected environment. They then rotoscoped out the parts of the mirror not containing the foreground actors and their reflections, and replaced these with the digital environment.[62][63] Some of the original shots captured smudges and dirt on the mirrors, so the studio developed a way to extract them so they could paste them back into the film. A matte-painting was constructed for the night-day time lapses in the film too, created by matchmoving and reprojecting shots of the buildings it features, captured at different times of the day, together.[62] Rodeo FX also adjusted the pace of scenes. Iñárritu demanded a \"very precise rhythm and flow\" to the film, so the studio had to re-speed much of it with timewarp curves to fit the pacing the director desired.[62]\n\n\nUnlike some of the smaller adjustments though, the flying sequence required extensive preparation. Iñárritu spent three weeks with Halon Entertainment to previsualize the sequence.[64] In New York, Lubezki then used the choreography of the previsualization to shoot background plates for the sequence,[62] using a camera crane on a truck.[61] When these were shot, Lubezki had mounted four GoPro cameras to the lens of the film camera to capture the light environment around him. Later, on a greenstage in Montreal, using a technique he had developed on *Gravity*, Lubezki lit Keaton with LED panels featuring high-dynamic-range images of the surrounding New York footage. The panels then realistically lit Keaton. Khanikian described the effect of the process, saying, \"Instead of using standard lighting on greenscreen, [we were getting] the proper red bounce from the red bricks, and the same color of the sky reflected on Michael's head. It worked so well.\" Rodeo FX then completed the final shots.[62] The sequence was the last piece the editors inserted into the film. Mirrione commented that before the sequence was finished, they \"had only imagined what it was going to feel like\", but once it was completed, \"it took the movie to this ecstatic level that absolutely blew me away\".[36]\n\n\nSound design for the film was handled by Martín Hernández, who has worked on all the director's feature films. The production sound his team was given was \"surprisingly perfect and clean\", so they didn't need to spend much time tidying it.[65] The lack of visual cuts in the film meant a departure from the usual way Hernández edited sound though. \"Normally, Alejandro likes, as he calls it, 'the clashing of the sounds'. The camera changes angle within the scene and there is a change of everything – backgrounds, texture, dialog. Obviously, that would not work on *Birdman* because here, everything is flowing.\"[65] Additionally, the sound of objects in the film needed to be coordinated with their position onscreen, a non-trivial task, since the camera was nearly always moving.[65] Hernández also helped to cut Sánchez's tracks, selecting and editing moments from the New York recordings against the film.[66] When the tracks were re-recording in Los Angeles, in order \"to have distance, and closeness and resonance\" the team used thirty-two microphones for each take. Hernández described the job as \"crazy\".[65] A large challenge of the post-production soundwork was designing the sound of the theatre audience, particularly in the scene when Mike is drunk and comes out of character. Iñárritu knew how he wanted the audience to respond, but figuring out the sound of their reaction took four months of work from five sound designers.[66] Hernández said he thought, for a film in general, that the narrative created by sound \"provokes more 'explosions'\" than that created by images, and that in *Birdman*, \"Alejandro has sound exploding all throughout the film\".[66]\n\n\nThe digital intermediate was completed by a team at Technicolor led by Steven Scott. They had previously collaborated with Lubezki on *Gravity*,[67] but needed to approach *Birdman* differently because of the continuous-shot approach. According to Scott, \"we have never done anything like it before\".[68] The color timing had to be done in such a way that the transitions between color-corrected environments were invisible, in contrast to a usual film where the transitions coincide with visible cuts. To do this, the team inserted their own cuts whenever the camera was stationary, and in the middle of pans and other camera movements. They then devised a way to color correct the stationary cuts and turn the moving cuts into a form of dissolve, allowing them to \"do all these independent, crazy, complicated, color corrections that would flow organically from one to another\". Inserting the dissolves required rotoscoping methods which the software Scott and his team were using did not have, but an enterprise agreement between Technicolor and the software's developer led to the creation of a tool Scott required. For the color timing itself, one of the priorities of the team was making the faces as dimensional and readable as possible. This required, amongst other things, that faces be highlighted, but the moving camerawork meant that the mattes used in this process had to be animated by hand. Lubezki would provide notes on the areas he wanted tracked, then the team would carry out the animations. Of the whole process, Iñárritu remarked that \"everyone was out of their comfort zone\", while Scott said it was the most challenging DI project of his career.[69]\n\n\n\n## Analysis and themes[edit]\n\n\nThe director has emphasized and defended the various ambiguities intentionally included in the film: \"At the ending of the film, [it] can be interpreted as many ways as there are seats in the theater.\"[70] Many aspects of film theory were debated concerning the film by critical reviews which included, among other subjects, (a) film genre; (b) intended and unresolved ambiguities of plot; and (c) the complex interaction of Riggan's personal life with his professional life as an actor. A short list of the diverse forms of film genre associated with the film has included it being referred to alternatively as a black-humor film, a mental health film, a realism/​surrealism/​magical realism film, a dark-humor parody film, a film of psychological realism, a failed domestic reconciliation drama, or a film concerning theatrical realism and naturalism. Iñárritu has maintained his penchant, well-known to followers of his previous films, for deliberately including multiple plot lines in this film which are intentionally left unresolved at the ending.[71] Separate reviews in the press have also summarized the film as closely associated with the theme of the final tailspin of a late mid-life crisis in the life of a has-been actor seeking closure and resolution in his public and private life.[72]\n\n\nThe father-daughter themes in the film, portrayed through the relationship of Riggan and Samantha, were the \"most difficult\" and important parts of the film to depict for co-writers Dinelaris and Giacobone, as they both had similar experiences within their families involving their own relationships with their daughters. When the writers were asked about the meaning of the ambiguous ending which the director refused to comment upon, they stated that any comedic ending was completely ruled out. The writers also stated that reflections about the conclusion to the film were not directly concentrated upon Riggan or the character of Birdman as much as upon the lives of the surviving characters portrayed in the film, in particular the portrayal of Riggan's daughter Samantha.[73][74]\n\n\nNoting the thematic pull between Riggan's insanity or actual superpowers, Travis LaCouter of *First Things* writes that \"the importance of these powers – real or imagined – is apparent: They are for Riggan the thing beyond the labels, the kernel of his genius and, because he sees drawing upon them as selling out, the source of his great angst.\" LaCouter concludes that \"the quirky profundity of this film is in how it dares the viewer to consider the everyday magic that we tend to ignore, repress, or resent\".[75]\n\n\nCritics Barbara Schweizerhof and Matthew Pejkovici see the film's central theme as a satirical critique of contemporary theatrical realism, with Pejkovici comparing it favorably to Fellini's film *8½* (1963). As Pejkovici states: \"Much like Fellini's 1960[sic] classic *8½*, Iñárritu's *Birdman* is a very intimate film about an artist's malaise, yet is epic, innovative, and ambitious in approach. Iñárritu captures the artist's battle between ambition, admiration, and celebrity with stunning scope and skill in the form of a one-take format, as his camera sweeps through the backstage corridors, across the stage, out on the busy NYC streets, and back again in breathtaking fashion.\"[76]\n\n\nThematically, Richard Brody also compared it to *Opening Night* (1977) by John Cassavetes.[77] Brody said that the actors played in \"the sort of modern naturalism, without eccentricity of gesture, excess of expression, or heightened and formalistic precision, that is the business-casual of contemporary cinema\".[77] *The Wall Street Journal*'s Caryn James compared the story to that of *Don Quixote* (who believes himself to be a knight), as the main character believes he is a superhero (the equivalent to a knight in the 21st century).[78] This relationship was also highlighted by the scholarly literature.[79]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Birdman* was selected as the opening film of the 71st Venice International Film Festival along with Mohsen Makhmalbaf's new film.[80] A limited release began in four North American theatres on October 17, 2014,[81][82] followed by a nationwide release in 857 theatres on November 14, 2014.[83]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Birdman* grossed $42.3 million in North America and $60.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $103.2 million, against a budget of about $17 million.[3]\n\n\nThe film earned $424,397 during its limited North America opening in four theatres in New York and Los Angeles on the weekend of October 17, 2014, a per-theater average of $106,099, making it the 18th all-time earner (eighth among live-action movies) and ranking No. 20.[84] In the second weekend of October 24, 2014, *Birdman* expanded to 50 theaters and earned $1.38 million, which translates to a $27,593 per-theater average.[85] The film expanded nationwide to 857 theaters in the weekend of November 14, 2014, grossing $2,471,471, with a per theatre average of $2,884, and ranking No. 10. In the same weekend, *Birdman* grossed $11.6 million.[86]\n\n\nThe film opened in Mexico on November 13, 2014, grossing $628,915 in its opening weekend, and opened in the United Kingdom on January 2, 2015, grossing $2,337,407 over the weekend.[87] In the United Kingdom, Australia, and Italy, the film grossed $7.6 million, $3.97 million, and $1.97 million, respectively.[88]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91%, based on 351 reviews, and an average rating of 8.50/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"A thrilling leap forward for director Alejandro González Iñárritu, *Birdman* is an ambitious technical showcase powered by a layered story and outstanding performances from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton.\"[89] On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 87 out of 100, based on 58 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[90] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[91] In 2015, the film was named as one of the top 50 films of the decade so far by *The Guardian*.[92]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of (left to right) Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone were all lauded by critics and nominated for Academy Awards.\n\nMargaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from *At the Movies* praised the film's writing, direction, performances and cinematography. Stratton also described the implementation of the percussion score as \"really exciting\", while Pomeranz summarised: \"It's just really beautifully written and stunningly performed and beautifully made.\" The pair both gave the film five stars, making *Birdman* the only film to receive such a rating from the hosts in 2014.[93][94] In *The New York Times*, Manohla Dargis compared the main character to Icarus,[95] the Greek mythological figure who crashed to his death after flying too close to the sun. She also noted a reference to Susan Sontag's *Against Interpretation* in the dressing-room mirror.[95]\n\n\nRichard Kolker compared the film to both Alfred Hitchcock's *Rope* (1948) and Alexander Sokurov's *Russian Ark* (2002). Kolker concludes that *Birdman* is \"a film about acting, identity, transformation, and the mysterious effects of superheroes, (and) is filmed to create the illusion of being made in one continuous take. As with *Rope*, the edits are hidden, and the result is a rhythmic slide through the life of an actor in search of his self, a search doomed from the start.\"[96] Ollie Cochran called the film \"an amalgam of technical prowess, hypnotising visuals and pragmatically perceptive dialogue\", believing it to be \"a thought-provoking, energetic perspective of a fading actor looking to revitalise his career.\"[97]\n\n\nInternational reception of the film was also at a high level of praise. In Germany, a film aggregate rating at EPD Film gave the film a 3.4 out of 5 rating, based on seven critiques. The German critic Barbara Schweizerhof gave the film a 4 out of 5 possible stars, complimenting the director's satirical virtuosity in making the film. In her review, Schweizerhof spoke of the film as inviting the viewer to re-watch it \"a second and third time\", and praised the technical achievement of representing a storyline depicting \"the feverish stream of consciousness\" of its main character throughout the film.[98]\n\n\nThe camerawork, which depicts most of the film as one continuous take, was met with extensive acclaim for its execution and usage. The acting was widely praised, particularly Keaton's,[99][100] with Peter Debruge of *Variety* calling the performance the \"comeback of the century\".[101] Debruge described the film as \"a self-aware showbiz satire\", and called it \"a triumph on every creative level\".[102] Robbie Collin of *The Daily Telegraph* rated the film 5/5 and gave particular praise to the use of long takes by Emmanuel Lubezki, director of photography.[103] Richard Roeper gave the film an \"A\" and wrote that Keaton made a serious case for an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination (which Keaton later achieved).[99]\n\n\nWriting for *The New Yorker*, Richard Brody called the film \"Godardian\", comparing it to *Pierrot le Fou* (1965), *Every Man for Himself* (1980), *Alphaville* (1965), and *Germany Year 90 Nine Zero* (1991), four classic films by French director Jean-Luc Godard.[77] However, he suggested the film fell short of reaching the same cinematic mastery, adding, \"it's not a good idea for a filmmaker to get in the ring with Mr. Godard\".[77] In his critical comments on the film, he concluded that the film \"trade[d] on facile, casual dichotomies of theatre versus cinema and art versus commerce\" and \"deliver[ed] a work of utterly familiar and unoriginal drama\".[77] In another review in *The New Yorker* separately supplementing the review by Brody, Anthony Lane rejected the film's suggestion that film critics are out to destroy films, explaining, \"Someone could have told Iñárritu that critics, though often mean, are not preemptively so, and that anybody who'd say, as Tabitha does, 'I'm going to destroy your play', before actually seeing it, would not stay long in the job.\"[104]\n\n\nSome reviews were negative. Richard Lawson of *Vanity Fair*, called the film \"hoary\" and \"deceptively simple\".[105] Scott Tobias, writing for The Dissolve, gave the film 1.5 stars. He commends Lubezki's cinematography as succeeding at \"trapping viewers in a pressure-cooker atmosphere as Riggan and his players struggle to keep it together\", but suggests that Iñárritu is \"incapable of modulation\", and that there exists \"a sourness to *Birdman* that Iñárritu can't turn into wit\".[106]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by Birdman (film)\n\nAt the 87th Academy Awards, *Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)* won four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography. Michael Keaton was nominated for Best Actor, Edward Norton and Emma Stone were nominated in Best Supporting Acting categories, and it also received nominations for Sound Editing and Sound Mixing.[107]\n\n\nKeaton received his first Golden Globe Award, winning for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards. The film also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay.\n\n\n\n#### Top ten lists[edit]\n\n\n*Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)* was listed on many critics' top ten lists.[108]\n\n\n\n* 1st – Anne Thompson, *Indiewire*\n* 1st – Garry Arnot, *Cinema Perspective*\n* 1st – Steve Persall, *Tampa Bay Times*\n* 1st – Christy Lemire, RogerEbert.com\n* 1st – Lisa Kennedy, *Denver Post*\n* 1st – Kristopher Tapley, *HitFix*\n* 1st – Steven Rea, *The Philadelphia Inquirer*\n* 1st – James Verniere, *Boston Herald*\n* 2nd – Bob Mondello, *NPR*\n* 2nd – Rafer Guzmán, *Newsday*\n* 2nd – Gregory Ellwood, *HitFix*\n* 2nd – Peter Travers, *Rolling Stone*\n* 2nd – Jocelyn Noveck, Associated Press\n* 2nd – Ann Hornaday, *The Washington Post*\n* 2nd – Bill Goodykoontz, *Arizona Republic*\n* 2nd – Barbara Vancheri, *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette*\n* 2nd – Mick LaSalle & Leba Hertz, *San Francisco Chronicle*\n* 2nd – Jeffrey M.

It was written by Iñárritu, Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris Jr., and Armando Bó. The film stars Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson, a faded Hollywood actor best known for playing the superhero \"Birdman\", as he struggles to mount a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story, \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\". The film's supporting cast includes Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts.\n\n\nThe film covers the period of previews leading to the play's opening. With a brief exception, it appears as if it was filmed in a single shot, an idea Iñárritu had from the film's conception. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki believed that the recording time necessary for the long take approach could not have been made with older technology. The film was shot in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million, jointly financed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, Regency Enterprises and Worldview Entertainment. It premiered the following year in August, when it opened the 71st Venice International Film Festival.\n\n\n*Birdman* had a limited theatrical release in the United States on October 17, 2014, followed by a wide release on November 14. Grossing more than $103 million worldwide, the film received critical acclaim, with praise for its screenplay, direction, cinematography, and the performances of the cast (particularly Keaton, Norton, and Stone). *Birdman* won the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography from a total of nine nominations, tying it with *The Grand Budapest Hotel* for the most nominated and awarded film at the 87th Academy Awards. It also won Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Keaton and Best Screenplay at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nRiggan Thomson is a faded actor famous for playing a superhero named Birdman in a film trilogy from 1989 to 1992. He is tormented by the mocking and critical internal voice of his past self as Birdman and frequently visualizes himself performing feats of levitation and telekinesis. Riggan is trying to regain recognition by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story, \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\" However, the Birdman voice wants Riggan to return to blockbuster cinema and insists that he is essential to Riggan's identity.\n\n\nJake, Riggan's best friend and lawyer, is producing the play, which co-stars Riggan's girlfriend, Laura, and Broadway débutante Lesley. Riggan's daughter Sam, a recovering drug addict with whom he is trying to reconnect, is working as his assistant. The day before the first preview, a light fixture falls onto Riggan's hapless co-star, Ralph. At Lesley's suggestion, Riggan replaces Ralph with her boyfriend, the brilliant but volatile and self-absorbed method actor Mike Shiner.\n\n\nThe first previews are disastrous: Mike breaks character over replacing his gin with water, attempts to rape Lesley during a sex scene, and complains that the prop gun does not look natural. Riggan clashes continually with Mike, culminating in a brawl after Riggan reads a *New York Times* interview with Mike in which he steals Riggan's personal reason for doing a Raymond Carver play. Jake persuades Riggan to continue with the play. When Riggan berates Sam after finding her using marijuana, she insultingly rebukes and chastises him, telling him he is irrelevant, and the play is for his own vanity.\n\n\nDuring the final preview, after seeing Mike and Sam kissing backstage, Riggan accidentally locks himself outside with his robe stuck in the fire escape door. He is forced to walk through Times Square in his briefs and enter through the audience to do the final scene. A concerned Sam is waiting in his dressing room after the show, and she thinks the performance was very unusual but interesting. She shows him that the Times Square footage is going viral and explains how this actually helps him.\n\n\nRiggan goes to a bar for a drink and approaches Tabitha Dickinson, a cynical and highly influential theater critic. She promises to \"kill\" his play with a deprecating review without seeing it. On the way back, Riggan buys a pint of whiskey, drinks it, and passes out on a stoop. The next day, walking to the theater with a severe hangover, he visualizes Birdman trying to convince him to abandon the play and make a fourth Birdman film. Riggan then imagines himself flying through the streets of Manhattan before arriving at the theater.\n\n\nOn opening night, the play goes very well. In his dressing room, a strangely calm Riggan confesses to his ex-wife, Sylvia, that several years ago, he attempted to drown himself in the ocean after she caught him having an affair. He also tells her about the Birdman voice, which she ignores. After Sylvia leaves, Riggan picks up a real gun for the final scene in which his character commits suicide. At the climax, Riggan shoots himself in the head on stage. The play receives a standing ovation.\n\n\nRiggan wakes up in a hospital—the suicide attempt merely blew off his nose, which has been surgically reconstructed. Tabitha has published a glowing review of the play, mistaking the suicide attempt for a new acting technique. Sam visits with flowers and takes a picture of him to share with the skyrocketing number of followers on the Twitter account she has created for him.\n\n\nWhile she steps outside to find a vase, Riggan goes into the bathroom, removes the bandages revealing his swollen new nose, and says goodbye to Birdman, seen seated on the toilet. Fascinated by the birds flying outside his room, he opens the window, peers up at them, and then climbs out onto the ledge. Sam returns to an empty room and frantically runs to the open window, scanning the ground before slowly looking up into the sky and smiling at what she sees.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson\n\t+ Benjamin Kanes as Young Riggan / Birdman\n* Zach Galifianakis as Jake\n* Edward Norton as Mike Shiner\n* Andrea Riseborough as Laura Alburn\n* Amy Ryan as Sylvia Thomson\n* Emma Stone as Sam Thomson\n* Naomi Watts as Lesley Truman\n* Lindsay Duncan as Tabitha Dickinson\n* Merritt Wever as Annie\n* Jeremy Shamos as Ralph\n* Bill Camp as Crazy Man\n* Damian Young as Gabriel\n* Michael Siberry as Larry\n* Clark Middleton as Sydney\n* Paula Pell as Lady in Bar\n* David Fierro as Man in Bar\n* Donna Lynne Champlin as Broadway Lady\n* Craig muMs Grant as Broadway Man\n* Jackie Hoffman as Mary Lady on Balcony\n* Susan Blackwell as Intermission Woman\n* Stephen Adly Guirgis as Good Neighbor\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n*Birdman* director Alejandro G. Iñárritu originally conceived the film as a comedy filmed in a single shot set in a theatre. The original choice behind the film's genre, which was subsequently re-adapted to concentrate on Riggan's final emotional tailspin, came from the director wanting to see a change in his approach. All his previous films were dramas, and after directing *Biutiful*, he did not want to approach his new film in the same tragic manner again.[4] The decision to make the film appear as a single shot came from his realization that \"we live our lives with no editing\". By presenting the film as a continuous shot, he could \"submerge the protagonist in an 'inescapable reality' and take the audience with him\".[5] Iñárritu shared his idea with the Argentine screenwriters/cousins Nicolás Giacobone and Armando Bo, as well as playwright Alexander Dinelaris, Jr., who had all worked with him on his previous film.[6][a] Their first reaction was to tell him the continuous-shot idea could not work.[4] According to Dinelaris and Giacobone, \"huge\" and \"important\" people told him to not even try the project for the same reason.[6] Iñárritu himself described the technique as \"almost suicidal\", worrying that it would be distracting, instead of immersive.[8] Dinelaris later said that had they truly paused and considered the idea, they might have talked Iñárritu out of it.[4]\n\n\nThe personal and vocational experiences of the four co-writers were central to writing the script. Dinelaris' exposure to Broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage, though he admitted exaggerating these. He also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film \"were really more like play scenes\".[6] Iñárritu's own experiences influenced many of *Birdman*'s themes. \"What this film talks about, I have been through\", Iñárritu recalled. \"I have seen and experienced all of it; it's what I have been living through the last years of my life.\"[4] Dinelaris described this aspect as \"a laughing look at oneself\", but said it had to be done in a comedic way; otherwise, \"it would have been the most unbelievably self-absorbed look at the subject\".[4] Themes from Raymond Carver's short story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\", which Riggan adapts for stage in the story, also influenced the script. Iñárritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in Riggan's story and those of Carver's.[6] Because of this, it was important to the director that Carver's story be the subject of the play depicted within the film. Therefore, Iñárritu stated that his desire to use Carver's work was \"terrifying\" because the rights to using the Carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film, but no issues arose. Carver's widow, writer Tess Gallagher, loved the script and permitted the adaptation, saying that Carver would be laughing about the film.[4]\n\n\nWhile some aspects of the film – the first frame with Riggan, for instance – went unchanged from *Birdman's* conception to release,[4] others went through several iterations. One of these was the sequence in which alter ego Birdman takes complete control over Riggan's thoughts. The writers knew it would occur at Riggan's lowest point, so at one stage planned for it to happen after Riggan hears the initial negative press coverage and destroys his dressing room. In another discarded version, Riggan tries to drown himself in Central Park and flies out to save himself.[6]\n\n\nThe film's ending also changed, the final version being written halfway through filming.[9] The original intended to depict Johnny Depp in Riggan's dressing room with a *Pirates of the Caribbean* poster in the back. Iñárritu grew to strongly dislike this ending, calling it \"so embarrassing\", and rewrote it with Dinelaris and Giacobone after a new ending came to him in a dream.[9][10] Iñárritu was reluctant to describe the original ending, but it was leaked by Dinelaris. He said the original ending was set in the theatre, instead of the hospital, and involved Depp putting on Riggan Thomson's wig, and in Jack Sparrow's voice, \"... the poster asks Depp, 'What the fuck are we doing here, mate?', and it was going to be the satire of the endless loop of that.\"[11] The director and co-authors ruled out the satirical ending, and favored the new, more ambiguous, ending.[10][11][12]\n\n\nThe project of co-writing was expedited by the collaboration between the four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails.[4] Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in *Birdman* came from Skype sessions at two in the morning where he and Giacobone were \"cracking each other up\". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said: \"We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting\". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be \"very, very sure about what was on the page\".[6] As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft.[13] As Dinelaris summarized: \"You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot. You have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. *Birdman* looks like a good idea now, but [at the time of production] we did not know how we would land.\"[6]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Keaton was Iñárritu's first choice to play Riggan Thomson.\nIñárritu cast several of the leading roles before the film was financed.[2] Among these was the lead role. Early in script development, Iñárritu did not have Keaton in mind,[5] but he had changed his mind by the end: \"When I finished the script, I knew that Michael was not the choice or option, he was the guy\".[14] Iñárritu cast Keaton for his depth in a variety of acting styles: He could handle the demands of the stage, up-close work, and comedy and empathy \"with a profound depth to both\".[15]\n\n\nKeaton knew about *Birdman* before Iñárritu contacted him. He was in the middle of production of another project when he learned that Iñárritu was making another film. Keaton, a fan of his work, flew home to find out more.[16] Iñárritu sent him the script and they discussed it over dinner. The first thing Keaton asked the director was whether he was making fun of him (regarding his role in Tim Burton's *Batman* films), but after Iñárritu explained the role, its technicalities, and the film's production, Keaton agreed to play Riggan. Despite this, the final film contains numerous references to Burton's *Batman* films, including the year Riggan is mentioned to have last played Birdman being 1992.[5]\n\n\nIñárritu called his decision behind casting Galifianakis as Jake \"a bet\". Galifianakis met the director's criteria of being lovable and funny, but Iñárritu also considered him sensitive, which scored him the role.[17] Emma Stone already knew she wanted to work with Iñárritu before she was offered the role of Sam. The script that Iñárritu gave her and the rest of the cast came with the photo *Man on Wire*, which featured Philippe Petit crossing the Twin Towers on a tightrope. Iñárritu told the cast, \"We are doing that\".[10][18]\n\n\nOnce these actors were committed, Iñárritu sought funding. He first invited Fox Searchlight Pictures to finance the project, but they turned his offer down because they felt his asking budget was too high.[2] At one stage Megan Ellison of Annapurna Pictures wanted to be involved in the project, but decided against it because, unlike her other films, she had not been involved since the beginning.[19] Iñárritu approached Brad Weston, president of New Regency, who accepted the offer.[20] When executive Claudia Lewis of Searchlight heard about the deal, she reconsidered and asked to be included in the deal. Searchlight and New Regency had previously worked together to finance *12 Years a Slave*, and they decided to join together for *Birdman*, financing a budget of $16.5 million.[2]\n\n\nWeston and Lewis developed a close relationship with Iñárritu, editing the script with him and switching some of the actors. When they joined production, Josh Brolin was set to play the role of Mike Shiner, but the financiers decided to switch him for Norton because of scheduling conflicts.[2]\n\n\nHe said Norton's experience as a theatre actor, combined with his self-confidence, meant that \"in a way, there was some kind of mental reality to Edward\",[17] but Norton believes he was the one who convinced Iñárritu to take him on. Norton was a fan of the director's work and impressed with his ability to push outside film-making boundaries.[21] Norton heard about Iñárritu's project from a friend. Once he got the script, he read it straight through until 3:00 am. Norton said, \"I laughed so hard I woke people up.\"[22] Norton wanted to meet Iñárritu the next day, and once they met, Norton told him he could not cast someone who was the \"embodiment\" of what the script was taking aim at. Instead, the director needed to cast someone \"who has at least a little bit of authentic depth of experience, in this world\". Iñárritu agreed.[23]\n\n\nAmy Ryan, one of the last actors to be cast,[24] was invited because Iñárritu had seen her in the play *Detroit*.[25] Lindsay Duncan had vast experience in the theatre world too, and decided to accept the offer to play the critic because of the quality of the script. \"It's delicious because of the writing.\"[26] But like Shiner's character, Iñárritu found casting Laura difficult. Riseborough met him on a street corner for a cup of tea, and recalling the event, said, \"I told him that I would crawl across hot coals to work with him\".[27] Iñárritu described Laura as \"a very wacky, quirky role\", but said, \"when [Andrea Riseborough] did it, I knew that it was her, because she did it right in the tone, and she understood who she was – she was not judging\".[17]\n\n\n\n### Rehearsal and filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Keaton rehearsing an action-sequence of the film.\nOnce the writing was finished, Iñárritu contacted friend and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki to discuss his idea for the film.[28] After reading the script, Lubezki was worried that Iñárritu would offer him the job since *Birdman* \"had all of the elements of a movie that I did not want to do at all\" – comedy, studio work and long takes – but changed his mind after further discussion with the director.[29] The pair had worked together on commercials and a short film in the anthology *To Each His Own Cinema*,[30] but not on any feature films. Lubezki wanted to be sure that this was a decision Rodrigo Prieto, cinematographer of all four of Iñárritu's feature films, was comfortable with, but after receiving his blessing, the two headed into pre-production.[29]\n\n\nLubezki was concerned that no film had been shot in the way Iñárritu envisioned, meaning there would be no reference material to look up. The two decided the only way to learn how to shoot it would be to shoot it themselves, so they built a proxy stage at Sony Studios in Los Angeles.[28][31] The setup was minimal. Canvas and C-stands were used for walls, while tape and a few pieces of furniture marked out areas.[28][32] Using a camera and some stand-ins, the duo worked through the movie to see if it was possible.[28] Realizing no theatre could accommodate the intricate camerawork they needed, they hired Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York.[33] Still, Iñárritu wanted to shoot at a Broadway theater, but would have to wait until several weeks into rehearsals before securing St. James Theatre.[34] They then spent a few months designing and making \"blueprints\" of the shots and blocking the scenes, using the stand-ins to read and walk through the script.[29] The planning was precise. Iñárritu said: \"There was no room to improvise at all. Every movement, every line, every door opening, absolutely everything was rehearsed.\"[31] The actors started rehearsing once this preliminary work was completed: According to Lubezki, they did the scenes with the actors \"once we kind of knew what the rhythm of the scenes were\". He described the atypical approach \"like an upside down movie where you do post-production before the production\".[28]\n\n\n\n\n> I know Alejandro is very adamant about kind of keeping the rabbit in the hat and not being super specific about how it was shot, but I will say it took a lot of rehearsal and it was very specific... There was no luxury of cutting away or editing around anything. You knew that every scene was staying in the movie, and like theater, this was it, this was your chance to live this scene.\n> \n> — Emma Stone[35]\n> \n\n\nEditors Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione were involved in the project by this stage. When Iñárritu told Mirrione that he planned for Lubezki to record table readings and the rehearsals, he suggested they edit them immediately to discover what was and was not working early on.[36] The editing also allowed the editors to discuss pacing issues with the director,[37][38] such as the position of the night-day transitions and other moments of rest in the film.[36] Production designer Kevin Thompson was on hand too, and mapped out the scenes.[34] The camerawork required many elements of the set to be built in a certain way. For example, Riggan's makeup mirror and desk were constructed so that the camera would see his reflection.[32] Thompson also took into consideration the needs of the crew, for instance designing the stairs a little wider for Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff's footsize.[39]\nHe then constructed a template of the set they would build when in New York.[34] The writers were also involved in the rehearsals, fine-tuning the script to \"make sure the film was fluid and never stopped\".[13]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSt. James Theatre and Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York were used to film the stage and backstage scenes of *Birdman*, respectively.\n\nOnce the logistics of the scenes were worked out and they had the timing down, the team headed to Kaufman Studios for more rehearsals, followed by principal photography based exclusively in New York during the spring of 2013.[40] The studios were used to film the backstage areas of the film, including Riggan's dressing room and the theatre corridors. St. James Theatre was used for two weeks; it was the location for the stage scenes.[41] The bar segments were shot in The Rum House on 47th Street,[42] and 43rd Street was used for the action-sequence.[43] The film was unable to be shot chronologically because of scheduling with the theatre.[44] Throughout the locations, including the studio, the scenes were lit with natural light,[b] since Lubezki wanted the movie \"to look as naturalistic as possible\". The night-time scenes were possible to film in this way due to the brightness of New York.[29] Lubezki found lighting the scenes to be the hardest part of his work on the film. Not only did the lighting need to look realistic, but also had to be designed so that the continuous movements of the camera did not project the crew's shadows onto the actors.[28]\n\n\nThroughout shooting, Arri Alexa cameras were used; an Alexa M was used for handheld sequences, and an Alexa XT was attached to the Steadicam. Neither used matte boxes, however. Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff explained this decision: \"We didn't want this big black thing gliding into their eyeline. This way we could get very close and get the light past the lens and onto the actor's face.\"[39] Lubezki – who did all the handheld camerawork[28] – had chosen the Alexa M because the camera was very small and allowed him to get into tiny spaces and close to the actors,[29] sometimes filming two inches (5 cm) away from Keaton's face.[32] The camera also allowed recording for such a long period – necessary for the long takes of the movie – that Lubezki went so far as to say the movie would have been impossible to do years before.[29] The cameras were lensed with Leica Summilux-C or Zeiss Master Primes.[39] Lubezki stated that these gave clean images, saying \"You can have all these lights in the frame and they are not really causing bad flare or things like that\".[29] In terms of sizes, they initially trialled a 21mm, but this did not give Iñárritu the \"intimacy\" he wanted. The crew instead went to an 18mm Leica, which was used for the majority of the film. Only when emphasis was needed did they switch the lens to a 14mm, but this was rare.[39]\n\n\nDespite all the preparation, a typical shooting day would begin with rehearsals. These usually lasted most of the morning, after which photography followed.[44] The meticulous timing for the scenes meant that takes were cancelled because of the slightest mishaps. Emma Stone, in an interview with Jimmy Fallon, recalled how a six-minute take of the scene where Riggan first meets Mike was ruined after she walked around a corner too quickly.[45] Takes were also repeated if a scene's rhythm did not feel right to Iñárritu, or if he and Lubezki were not satisfied with a shot's framing.[28] As shooting progressed, lines of dialog would also be dropped, giving Iñárritu more options during post-production.[36] Because of this, the number of takes for a given scene was high, usually 20 for the shorter scenes,[28] the takes running smoothly around the fifteenth.[39] Chris Haarhoff described it as \"a type of dance where everyone would hopefully try to peak all at the same moment\". The locations sometimes placed restrictions on the takes too; the live Times Square sequence was shot only twice since they did not want to attract the attention of tourists.[28]\n\n\nWhenever shooting was taking place there was pressure on everyone involved, but the cast had a positive experience. Norton said that normally in movie production half the people can \"check out\" due to repetitive aspects, but during the shooting of *Birdman*, \"everybody's on, the whole thing, and you're all on pins and needles because you're all relying on forty other people not to drop the ball\". Because of this, Stone said the director was able to get the best out of the cast, saying Iñárritu's process \"creates this sort of fury in you, and then you end up realizing that he just got so much out of you that you didn't even know you had\".[18] Naomi Watts commented that the atmosphere \"felt emblematic of how it feels onstage – at least my long-time memories from long ago\".[46] Andrea Riseborough, meanwhile, described the process as \"wonderful\", mentioning how it was possible to hear the filming of a sequence from far away before the camera arrived, and then \"the magic happens with you, and then everything leaves you, and everything's silent\".[35] Once they successfully completed a take though, it was obvious to everybody involved. Norton said: \"I've never, ever been on a set where every day ended with an enormous, authentic sort of cheer at having made it. You're waiting for the scream from [Iñárritu], and everybody was genuinely excited.\"[21]\n\n\n\n### Music and soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Birdman (soundtrack)\n\nThe film's original music segments are a drum score consisting entirely of solo jazz percussion performances by Antonio Sánchez. The score is offset by a number of well-known classical music pieces, including Mahler and Tchaikovsky. Iñárritu did not regard the particular choice of classical pieces as important.[47] Nonetheless, the choice of classical music was strongly oriented to highly melodic scores taken predominantly from the 19th century classical repertoire (Mahler, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Ravel). Iñárritu stated that the classical components come from the world of the play, citing the radio in Riggan's room and the show itself as two sources of the music.[48] The classical music segments also included two compositions by American composer John Adams. Several jazz compositions by Victor Hernández Stumpfhauser and Joan Valent counterbalance the original music composition by Sánchez. The drum sections comprise the majority of the score, however, and were composed by Sánchez. Iñárritu explained the choice by saying they helped to structure scenes, and that \"The drums, for me, was a great way to find the rhythm of the film... In comedy, rhythm is king, and not having the tools of editing to determine time and space, I knew I needed something to help me find the internal rhythm of the film.\"[49][50]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jazz drummer Antonio Sánchez composed and recorded the score for the film.\nIñárritu contacted friend and jazz drummer Antonio Sánchez in January 2013, inviting him to compose the score for the film.[51] His reaction to writing a soundtrack using only drums was similar to Lubezki's thoughts of shooting the movie like a single shot: \"It was a scary proposition because I had no point of reference of how to achieve this. There's no other movie I know that has a score like this.\"[52] Sánchez had also not worked on a film before,[51] nevertheless, after receiving the script, he composed \"rhythmic themes\" for each of the characters.[53] Iñárritu was looking for the opposite approach, however, preferring spontaneity and improvisation.[54] Sánchez then waited until production moved to New York before composing more,[53] where he visited the set for a couple of days to get a better idea of the film.[54] Following this, a week before principal photography, he and Iñárritu went to a studio to record some demos.[48][55] During these sessions the director would first talk him through the scene, then while Sánchez was improvising guide him by raising his hand to indicate an event – such as a character opening a door – or by describing the rhythm with verbal sounds.[55][56] They recorded around seventy demos,[53] which Iñárritu used to inform the pacing of the scenes on set,[28] and once filming was complete, spliced them into the rough cut.[55] Sánchez summarized the process by saying, \"The movie fed on the drums, and the drums fed on the imagery\".[54] The official soundtrack was released as a CD (77 min) in October 2014, and as an LP (69 min) in April 2015.[57]\nWhen the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences released their longlist for the Academy Award for Best Original Score in December 2014, *Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)* was absent from the list. The previous day, Sánchez received a note from the award committee explaining the decision, quoting rule fifteen of the 87th Academy Award Rules, noting \"the fact that the film also contains over a half an hour of non-original (mostly classical) music cues that are featured very prominently in numerous pivotal moments in the film made it difficult for the committee to accept your submission\". Sánchez launched an appeal, and along with Iñárritu and the executive vice-president of Fox Music, they sent letters to Charles Fox, the chair of the Academy's music branch executive committee, asking that the committee reconsider their decision.[58] One of the points they raised was that the committee incorrectly calculated the ratio of classical to original music, which after being clarified Sánchez thought he was \"on really solid ground\".[59] A response from Fox on December 19, however, explained that a special meeting of the music committee was held, and although its members had \"great respect\" for the score and considered it \"superb\", they thought that the classical music \"was also used as scoring\", \"equally contributes to the effectiveness of the film\", and that the musical identity of the film was created by both the drums and classical music. Ultimately, they did not overturn their decision.[58] Sánchez said that he and Iñárritu were not satisfied with the explanation.[59]\n\n\n\n### Post-production and visual effects[edit]\n\n\n*Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)* was edited by Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione, who had both worked with the director before on *21 Grams* and *Babel*. Stitching shots together was, of course, a crucial component of the editing, but Crise and Mirrione already had experience doing this. The director had included takes that were joined together in previous films, but in these if the editors didn't think the stitching worked, they had the ability to introduce cuts. Mirrione said that in *Birdman* Iñárritu had \"let go of that safety net\".[38] Because of this the editors needed to be involved in the project early on,[37] and during principal photography Crise was on set every day. (Mirrione was busy and unable to be in New York.)[36] Crise was not used to being on set and providing feedback, but said he was happy Iñárritu \"dragged it out\" of him, knowing that they wouldn't have much room to fix scenes later so they needed to get them right.[36] For stitching, aside from the director, Crise also discussed strategies with Lubezki and Thompson, and techniques for gluing takes together included panning on walls and actors' bodies.[60] The editors were used to being able to adjust the rhythm of a scene by the positioning of cuts, so without this tool used Sánchez's music instead. The director gave the New York recordings to Crise early on to help with pacing, asking him to cut the music to the film. Still, in terms of the editing workflow, Crise described it as \"pretty traditional\". The editors cut the film together back in Los Angeles.[36] A few weeks after shooting, they were quite far along the cut itself, and transitioned into visual-effects mode, where they fine-tuned the shots.[44]\n\n\n\n\n> They always talk about how when you're cutting a dance scene, a choreographer wouldn't want any cuts because she's designing something to see the whole movement, and that's what Alejandro was doing here.\n> \n> — Stephen Mirrione[37]\n> \n\n\nThe visual effects for the film were created by Montreal based studio Rodeo FX. They spent four months working on the film,[61] and according to visual effects supervisor Ara Khanikian \"visual effects touched 90% of the frames in the movie\".[62] A lot of the work was subtle, such as stitching shots together, or creating the background for the windows in the hospital scene.[62] Many shots in the film feature mirrors, and much work was spent removing the reflections of the crew from these. To accomplish this the studio created a 2.5D digital matte painting of the reflected environment. They then rotoscoped out the parts of the mirror not containing the foreground actors and their reflections, and replaced these with the digital environment.[62][63] Some of the original shots captured smudges and dirt on the mirrors, so the studio developed a way to extract them so they could paste them back into the film. A matte-painting was constructed for the night-day time lapses in the film too, created by matchmoving and reprojecting shots of the buildings it features, captured at different times of the day, together.[62] Rodeo FX also adjusted the pace of scenes. Iñárritu demanded a \"very precise rhythm and flow\" to the film, so the studio had to re-speed much of it with timewarp curves to fit the pacing the director desired.[62]\n\n\nUnlike some of the smaller adjustments though, the flying sequence required extensive preparation. Iñárritu spent three weeks with Halon Entertainment to previsualize the sequence.[64] In New York, Lubezki then used the choreography of the previsualization to shoot background plates for the sequence,[62] using a camera crane on a truck.[61] When these were shot, Lubezki had mounted four GoPro cameras to the lens of the film camera to capture the light environment around him. Later, on a greenstage in Montreal, using a technique he had developed on *Gravity*, Lubezki lit Keaton with LED panels featuring high-dynamic-range images of the surrounding New York footage. The panels then realistically lit Keaton. Khanikian described the effect of the process, saying, \"Instead of using standard lighting on greenscreen, [we were getting] the proper red bounce from the red bricks, and the same color of the sky reflected on Michael's head. It worked so well.\" Rodeo FX then completed the final shots.[62] The sequence was the last piece the editors inserted into the film. Mirrione commented that before the sequence was finished, they \"had only imagined what it was going to feel like\", but once it was completed, \"it took the movie to this ecstatic level that absolutely blew me away\".[36]\n\n\nSound design for the film was handled by Martín Hernández, who has worked on all the director's feature films. The production sound his team was given was \"surprisingly perfect and clean\", so they didn't need to spend much time tidying it.[65] The lack of visual cuts in the film meant a departure from the usual way Hernández edited sound though. \"Normally, Alejandro likes, as he calls it, 'the clashing of the sounds'. The camera changes angle within the scene and there is a change of everything – backgrounds, texture, dialog. Obviously, that would not work on *Birdman* because here, everything is flowing.\"[65] Additionally, the sound of objects in the film needed to be coordinated with their position onscreen, a non-trivial task, since the camera was nearly always moving.[65] Hernández also helped to cut Sánchez's tracks, selecting and editing moments from the New York recordings against the film.[66] When the tracks were re-recording in Los Angeles, in order \"to have distance, and closeness and resonance\" the team used thirty-two microphones for each take. Hernández described the job as \"crazy\".[65] A large challenge of the post-production soundwork was designing the sound of the theatre audience, particularly in the scene when Mike is drunk and comes out of character. Iñárritu knew how he wanted the audience to respond, but figuring out the sound of their reaction took four months of work from five sound designers.[66] Hernández said he thought, for a film in general, that the narrative created by sound \"provokes more 'explosions'\" than that created by images, and that in *Birdman*, \"Alejandro has sound exploding all throughout the film\".[66]\n\n\nThe digital intermediate was completed by a team at Technicolor led by Steven Scott. They had previously collaborated with Lubezki on *Gravity*,[67] but needed to approach *Birdman* differently because of the continuous-shot approach. According to Scott, \"we have never done anything like it before\".[68] The color timing had to be done in such a way that the transitions between color-corrected environments were invisible, in contrast to a usual film where the transitions coincide with visible cuts. To do this, the team inserted their own cuts whenever the camera was stationary, and in the middle of pans and other camera movements. They then devised a way to color correct the stationary cuts and turn the moving cuts into a form of dissolve, allowing them to \"do all these independent, crazy, complicated, color corrections that would flow organically from one to another\". Inserting the dissolves required rotoscoping methods which the software Scott and his team were using did not have, but an enterprise agreement between Technicolor and the software's developer led to the creation of a tool Scott required. For the color timing itself, one of the priorities of the team was making the faces as dimensional and readable as possible. This required, amongst other things, that faces be highlighted, but the moving camerawork meant that the mattes used in this process had to be animated by hand. Lubezki would provide notes on the areas he wanted tracked, then the team would carry out the animations. Of the whole process, Iñárritu remarked that \"everyone was out of their comfort zone\", while Scott said it was the most challenging DI project of his career.[69]\n\n\n\n## Analysis and themes[edit]\n\n\nThe director has emphasized and defended the various ambiguities intentionally included in the film: \"At the ending of the film, [it] can be interpreted as many ways as there are seats in the theater.\"[70] Many aspects of film theory were debated concerning the film by critical reviews which included, among other subjects, (a) film genre; (b) intended and unresolved ambiguities of plot; and (c) the complex interaction of Riggan's personal life with his professional life as an actor. A short list of the diverse forms of film genre associated with the film has included it being referred to alternatively as a black-humor film, a mental health film, a realism/​surrealism/​magical realism film, a dark-humor parody film, a film of psychological realism, a failed domestic reconciliation drama, or a film concerning theatrical realism and naturalism. Iñárritu has maintained his penchant, well-known to followers of his previous films, for deliberately including multiple plot lines in this film which are intentionally left unresolved at the ending.[71] Separate reviews in the press have also summarized the film as closely associated with the theme of the final tailspin of a late mid-life crisis in the life of a has-been actor seeking closure and resolution in his public and private life.[72]\n\n\nThe father-daughter themes in the film, portrayed through the relationship of Riggan and Samantha, were the \"most difficult\" and important parts of the film to depict for co-writers Dinelaris and Giacobone, as they both had similar experiences within their families involving their own relationships with their daughters. When the writers were asked about the meaning of the ambiguous ending which the director refused to comment upon, they stated that any comedic ending was completely ruled out. The writers also stated that reflections about the conclusion to the film were not directly concentrated upon Riggan or the character of Birdman as much as upon the lives of the surviving characters portrayed in the film, in particular the portrayal of Riggan's daughter Samantha.[73][74]\n\n\nNoting the thematic pull between Riggan's insanity or actual superpowers, Travis LaCouter of *First Things* writes that \"the importance of these powers – real or imagined – is apparent: They are for Riggan the thing beyond the labels, the kernel of his genius and, because he sees drawing upon them as selling out, the source of his great angst.\" LaCouter concludes that \"the quirky profundity of this film is in how it dares the viewer to consider the everyday magic that we tend to ignore, repress, or resent\".[75]\n\n\nCritics Barbara Schweizerhof and Matthew Pejkovici see the film's central theme as a satirical critique of contemporary theatrical realism, with Pejkovici comparing it favorably to Fellini's film *8½* (1963). As Pejkovici states: \"Much like Fellini's 1960[sic] classic *8½*, Iñárritu's *Birdman* is a very intimate film about an artist's malaise, yet is epic, innovative, and ambitious in approach. Iñárritu captures the artist's battle between ambition, admiration, and celebrity with stunning scope and skill in the form of a one-take format, as his camera sweeps through the backstage corridors, across the stage, out on the busy NYC streets, and back again in breathtaking fashion.\"[76]\n\n\nThematically, Richard Brody also compared it to *Opening Night* (1977) by John Cassavetes.[77] Brody said that the actors played in \"the sort of modern naturalism, without eccentricity of gesture, excess of expression, or heightened and formalistic precision, that is the business-casual of contemporary cinema\".[77] *The Wall Street Journal*'s Caryn James compared the story to that of *Don Quixote* (who believes himself to be a knight), as the main character believes he is a superhero (the equivalent to a knight in the 21st century).[78] This relationship was also highlighted by the scholarly literature.[79]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Birdman* was selected as the opening film of the 71st Venice International Film Festival along with Mohsen Makhmalbaf's new film.[80] A limited release began in four North American theatres on October 17, 2014,[81][82] followed by a nationwide release in 857 theatres on November 14, 2014.[83]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Birdman* grossed $42.3 million in North America and $60.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $103.2 million, against a budget of about $17 million.[3]\n\n\nThe film earned $424,397 during its limited North America opening in four theatres in New York and Los Angeles on the weekend of October 17, 2014, a per-theater average of $106,099, making it the 18th all-time earner (eighth among live-action movies) and ranking No. 20.[84] In the second weekend of October 24, 2014, *Birdman* expanded to 50 theaters and earned $1.38 million, which translates to a $27,593 per-theater average.[85] The film expanded nationwide to 857 theaters in the weekend of November 14, 2014, grossing $2,471,471, with a per theatre average of $2,884, and ranking No. 10. In the same weekend, *Birdman* grossed $11.6 million.[86]\n\n\nThe film opened in Mexico on November 13, 2014, grossing $628,915 in its opening weekend, and opened in the United Kingdom on January 2, 2015, grossing $2,337,407 over the weekend.[87] In the United Kingdom, Australia, and Italy, the film grossed $7.6 million, $3.97 million, and $1.97 million, respectively.[88]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91%, based on 351 reviews, and an average rating of 8.50/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"A thrilling leap forward for director Alejandro González Iñárritu, *Birdman* is an ambitious technical showcase powered by a layered story and outstanding performances from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton.\"[89] On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 87 out of 100, based on 58 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[90] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[91] In 2015, the film was named as one of the top 50 films of the decade so far by *The Guardian*.[92]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of (left to right) Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone were all lauded by critics and nominated for Academy Awards.\n\nMargaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from *At the Movies* praised the film's writing, direction, performances and cinematography. Stratton also described the implementation of the percussion score as \"really exciting\", while Pomeranz summarised: \"It's just really beautifully written and stunningly performed and beautifully made.\" The pair both gave the film five stars, making *Birdman* the only film to receive such a rating from the hosts in 2014.[93][94] In *The New York Times*, Manohla Dargis compared the main character to Icarus,[95] the Greek mythological figure who crashed to his death after flying too close to the sun. She also noted a reference to Susan Sontag's *Against Interpretation* in the dressing-room mirror.[95]\n\n\nRichard Kolker compared the film to both Alfred Hitchcock's *Rope* (1948) and Alexander Sokurov's *Russian Ark* (2002). Kolker concludes that *Birdman* is \"a film about acting, identity, transformation, and the mysterious effects of superheroes, (and) is filmed to create the illusion of being made in one continuous take. As with *Rope*, the edits are hidden, and the result is a rhythmic slide through the life of an actor in search of his self, a search doomed from the start.\"[96] Ollie Cochran called the film \"an amalgam of technical prowess, hypnotising visuals and pragmatically perceptive dialogue\", believing it to be \"a thought-provoking, energetic perspective of a fading actor looking to revitalise his career.\"[97]\n\n\nInternational reception of the film was also at a high level of praise. In Germany, a film aggregate rating at EPD Film gave the film a 3.4 out of 5 rating, based on seven critiques. The German critic Barbara Schweizerhof gave the film a 4 out of 5 possible stars, complimenting the director's satirical virtuosity in making the film. In her review, Schweizerhof spoke of the film as inviting the viewer to re-watch it \"a second and third time\", and praised the technical achievement of representing a storyline depicting \"the feverish stream of consciousness\" of its main character throughout the film.[98]\n\n\nThe camerawork, which depicts most of the film as one continuous take, was met with extensive acclaim for its execution and usage. The acting was widely praised, particularly Keaton's,[99][100] with Peter Debruge of *Variety* calling the performance the \"comeback of the century\".[101] Debruge described the film as \"a self-aware showbiz satire\", and called it \"a triumph on every creative level\".[102] Robbie Collin of *The Daily Telegraph* rated the film 5/5 and gave particular praise to the use of long takes by Emmanuel Lubezki, director of photography.[103] Richard Roeper gave the film an \"A\" and wrote that Keaton made a serious case for an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination (which Keaton later achieved).[99]\n\n\nWriting for *The New Yorker*, Richard Brody called the film \"Godardian\", comparing it to *Pierrot le Fou* (1965), *Every Man for Himself* (1980), *Alphaville* (1965), and *Germany Year 90 Nine Zero* (1991), four classic films by French director Jean-Luc Godard.[77] However, he suggested the film fell short of reaching the same cinematic mastery, adding, \"it's not a good idea for a filmmaker to get in the ring with Mr. Godard\".[77] In his critical comments on the film, he concluded that the film \"trade[d] on facile, casual dichotomies of theatre versus cinema and art versus commerce\" and \"deliver[ed] a work of utterly familiar and unoriginal drama\".[77] In another review in *The New Yorker* separately supplementing the review by Brody, Anthony Lane rejected the film's suggestion that film critics are out to destroy films, explaining, \"Someone could have told Iñárritu that critics, though often mean, are not preemptively so, and that anybody who'd say, as Tabitha does, 'I'm going to destroy your play', before actually seeing it, would not stay long in the job.\"[104]\n\n\nSome reviews were negative. Richard Lawson of *Vanity Fair*, called the film \"hoary\" and \"deceptively simple\".[105] Scott Tobias, writing for The Dissolve, gave the film 1.5 stars. He commends Lubezki's cinematography as succeeding at \"trapping viewers in a pressure-cooker atmosphere as Riggan and his players struggle to keep it together\", but suggests that Iñárritu is \"incapable of modulation\", and that there exists \"a sourness to *Birdman* that Iñárritu can't turn into wit\".[106]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by Birdman (film)\n\nAt the 87th Academy Awards, *Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)* won four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography. Michael Keaton was nominated for Best Actor, Edward Norton and Emma Stone were nominated in Best Supporting Acting categories, and it also received nominations for Sound Editing and Sound Mixing.[107]\n\n\nKeaton received his first Golden Globe Award, winning for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards. The film also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay.\n\n\n\n#### Top ten lists[edit]\n\n\n*Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)* was listed on many critics' top ten lists.[108]\n\n\n\n* 1st – Anne Thompson, *Indiewire*\n* 1st – Garry Arnot, *Cinema Perspective*\n* 1st – Steve Persall, *Tampa Bay Times*\n* 1st – Christy Lemire, RogerEbert.com\n* 1st – Lisa Kennedy, *Denver Post*\n* 1st – Kristopher Tapley, *HitFix*\n* 1st – Steven Rea, *The Philadelphia Inquirer*\n* 1st – James Verniere, *Boston Herald*\n* 2nd – Bob Mondello, *NPR*\n* 2nd – Rafer Guzmán, *Newsday*\n* 2nd – Gregory Ellwood, *HitFix*\n* 2nd – Peter Travers, *Rolling Stone*\n* 2nd – Jocelyn Noveck, Associated Press\n* 2nd – Ann Hornaday, *The Washington Post*\n* 2nd – Bill Goodykoontz, *Arizona Republic*\n* 2nd – Barbara Vancheri, *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette*\n* 2nd – Mick LaSalle & Leba Hertz, *San Francisco Chronicle*\n* 2nd – Jeffrey M.
