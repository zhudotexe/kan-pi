ministers.[1] Generally, the title is held by multiple individuals at any given time, with each vice-premier holding a broad portfolio of responsibilities. The first vice-premier takes over duties of the premier at the time of the latter's incapacity. The incumbent vice premiers, in order of rank, are Ding Xuexiang, He Lifeng, Zhang Guoqing and Liu Guozhong.\n\n\nThe highest-ranked office holder is informally called the **Senior Vice Premier** or **First Vice Premier** (Chinese: \u7b2c\u4e00\u526f\u603b\u7406) or **Executive Vice Premier** (Chinese: \u5e38\u52a1\u526f\u603b\u7406), a most prominent case being Deng Xiaoping in the mid-to-late 1970s.[2][3] In irregular instances, the position of a senior vice premier has been named either to indicate degree of power, nominal power, or when the premier is incapacitated and requires a full-time deputy to carry out his regular duties.\n\n\n\n\n## Selection[edit]\n\n\nOfficially, the vice premiers are appointed by the National People's Congress (NPC) upon the nomination of the premier.[4] The NPC also has the power to remove the vice premiers and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote.[4] In practice, the vice premiers are chosen within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership, including the Politburo Standing Committee.[5]\n\n\nThe length of the vice premier's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years, and the vice premiers are restricted to two consecutive terms.[4] Immediately after the election, the president signs the presidential order formalizing the appointment of the vice premiers. Since 2018, the vice premiers are required to collectively recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.[5]\n\n\n\n## Powers and authority[edit]\n\n\nVice premiers are the deputies to the premier, with each vice premier overseeing a certain area of administration.[6] Vice premiers are members of the executive meetings of the State Council, along with the premier, secretary-general and state councillors.[4] Additionally, all vice premiers have been members of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party in recent decades, with the executive vice premier being a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.[7]\n\n\n\n## Current vice premiers[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of vice premiers of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n\n| Vice Premiers of the People's Republic of China |\n| --- |\n| Portrait\n | Information\n | Posts\n |\n| ![Ding Xuexiang](image)Ding Xuexiang | Rank\n | 1st\n | Member of the Politburo Standing Committee (6th Ranked)\n\n\n---\n\n\nDevelopment and reform, education, science and technology, finance, ecology and environment, statistics, and intellectual property\n |\n| Name\n | Ding Xuexiang |\n| Constituency\n | Liaoning At-large\n |\n| Birthplace\n | Nantong, Jiangsu |\n| Took office\n | 12 March 2023\n |\n|  |\n| ![He Lifeng](image)He Lifeng | Rank\n | 2nd\n | Member of the Politburo\n\n\n---\n\n\nPublic finance, natural resource management, housing and urban development, transportation, commerce\n |\n| Name\n | He Lifeng |\n| Constituency\n | Inner Mongolia At-large\n |\n| Birthplace\n | Xingning, Guangdong |\n| Took office\n | 12 March 2023\n |\n|  |\n| ![Zhang Guoqing](image)Zhang Guoqing | Rank\n | 3rd\n | Member of the Politburo\n\n\n---\n\n\nIndustry and information technology, emergency management, and state-owned enterprises\n |\n| Name\n | Zhang Guoqing |\n| Constituency\n | Tibet At-large\n |\n| Birthplace\n | Luoshan County, Henan |\n| Took office\n | 12 March 2023\n |\n|  |\n| ![Liu Guozhong](image)Liu Guozhong | Rank\n | 4th\n | Member of the Politburo\n\n\n---\n\n\nAgriculture and rural affairs, health, poverty alleviation, and meteorology\n |\n| Name\n | Liu Guozhong |\n| Constituency\n | Henan At-large\n |\n| Birthplace\n | Wangkui County, Heilongjiang |\n| Took office\n | 12 March 2023\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Organic Law of the State Council of the People's Republic of China\". *National People's Congress*.

national cabinet of China. It is constitutionally the executive organ of the National People's Congress, the highest organ of state power, and the highest administrative organ of the country. It is composed of the premier, vice premiers, state councilors, ministers of ministries, directors of committees, the auditor general, and the secretary-general.\n\n\nThe premier is responsible for the State Council and exercises overall leadership of its work. The secretary-general of the State Council, under the leadership of the premier, is responsible for handling the daily work of the State Council and heads the General Office of the State Council. The executive meeting of the State Council, consisting of the premier, vice premiers, state councillors and the secretary-general, meets two to three times a month, while the plenary session, consisting of all members of the State Council, meets every six months\n\n\nThe State Council directly oversees provincial-level People's Governments, and in practice maintains membership with the top levels of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Aside from a few, members of the State Council are also members of the CCP's Central Committee.\n\n\n\n\n## Organization[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Constituent departments of the State Council\n\nThe State Council is described by the Chinese constitution as the executive organ of the National People's Congress (NPC), as well as the \"highest state administrative organ\".[3] Constitutionally, the main functions of the State Council are to formulate administrative measures, issue decisions and orders, and monitor their implementation; draft legislative bills for submission to the NPC or its Standing Committee; and prepare the economic plan and the state budget for deliberation and approval by the NPC.[3] The State Council is under authority of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), with the ultimate decisions being made by the Politburo.[4]\n\n\nCurrently, the State Council work rules state that it \"adheres to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\" and \"resolutely safeguards the authority of the Party Central Committee\"[5]\n\n\n\n### Composition[edit]\n\n\nThe State Council is composed of the premier, several vice premiers, several state councillors, ministers of ministries, directors of committees, the auditor general, and the secretary-general. The premier leads the State Council,[3][6] and is appointed by the NPC upon the nomination by the president,[3] though in practice the premier is chosen within the CCP leadership, including the Politburo Standing Committee.[7] The vice premiers (one executive and generally three others), state councillors, and a secretary-general (who normally also serves as a state councillor) all assist the premier.[3]\n\n\nEach vice premier oversees certain areas of administration in support of the premier.[8] In practice, the vice premiers and State Councillors assume responsibility for one or more sectors or issues, and remain in contact with the various bodies responsible for policy related to that area. This allows the Standing Committee to oversee a wide range of government functions. [9] Each State Councillor performs duties as designated by the Premier. The secretary-general heads the General Office which handles the day-to-day work of the State Council.[10][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\nThe State Council includes 26 constituent departments, and oversees the province-level governments throughout China.[4] Each ministry supervises one sector. Commissions outrank ministries and set policies for and coordinate the related activities of different administrative organs. Offices deal with matters of ongoing concern. Bureaus and administrations rank below ministries. In addition to the ministries, there are 38 centrally administered government organizations that report directly to the state council. The heads of these organizations attend full meetings of the state committee on an irregular basis.\n\n\nThe State Council controls the Ministry for National Defense but does not control the People's Liberation Army, which is instead controlled by the Central Military Commission (CMC).[11] The State Council previously had joint command over the People's Armed Police (PAP) together with the CMC, principally through the Ministry of Public Security, though 2018 reforms placed the PAP solely under CMC command.[12]:\u200a15\n\n\n\n### Meetings[edit]\n\n\nThe plenary session of the State Council meets every six months, composed of all members of the State Council. Between meetings it is guided by a Executive Meeting of the State Council\u00a0[zh] which is held two to three times a month, and can be called at the discretion of the premier.[13] The Executive Meeting is composed of the premier, vice premiers, state councilors, and the secretary-general.[3][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n## Members[edit]\n\n\n### Executive Meeting[edit]\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the Executive Meeting of the 14th State Council (March 2023 \u2013 March 2028)\n| # | Office\n | Portrait\n | Name\n | Party\n | Party memberships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Premier | ![](image) | Li Qiang\u674e\u5f3a\n |  | CCP | Politburo Standing CommitteeSecretary, State Council Party Group\u00a0[zh] |\n| 2\n | Vice Premier\n(first-ranked)\n | ![](image) | Ding Xuexiang\u4e01\u859b\u7965\n |  | CCP | Politburo Standing CommitteeDeputy Secretary, State Council Party Group\u00a0[zh] |\n| 3\n | Vice Premier | ![](image) | He Lifeng\u4f55\u7acb\u5cf0\n |  | CCP | PolitburoState Council Party Group\u00a0[zh] |\n| 4\n | Vice Premier | ![](image) | Zhang Guoqing\u5f20\u56fd\u6e05\n |  | CCP | PolitburoState Council Party Group\u00a0[zh] |\n| 5\n | Vice Premier | ![](image) | Liu Guozhong\u5218\u56fd\u4e2d\n |  | CCP | PolitburoState Council Party Group\u00a0[zh] |\n| 6\n | State CouncillorMinister of Public Security | ![](image) | Wang Xiaohong\u738b\u5c0f\u6d2a\n |  | CCP | SecretariatDeputy Secretary, Central Political and Legal Affairs CommissionState Council Party Group\u00a0[zh] |\n| 7\n | State CouncillorSecretary-General of the State Council |  | Wu Zhenglong\u5434\u653f\u9686\n |  | CCP | State Council Party Group\u00a0[zh]Secretary, State Council Organs Party Group\u00a0[zh] |\n| 8\n | State Councillor |  | Shen Yiqin\u8c0c\u8d3b\u7434\n |  | CCP | State Council Party Group\u00a0[zh] |\n\n\n### Plenary Meeting[edit]\n\n\nThe Plenary Meeting of the State Council is hosted by the Premier, joined by Vice Premiers, State Councillors, Ministers in charge of Ministries and Commissions, the Governor of the People's Bank, the Auditor-General, and the Secretary-General.
