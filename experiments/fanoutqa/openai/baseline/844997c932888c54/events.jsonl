Pritzker and his wife Cindy, the award is funded by the Pritzker family and sponsored by the Hyatt Foundation. It is considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes, and is often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nThe Pritzker Architecture Prize claims to be awarded \"irrespective of nationality, race, creed, or ideology\".[6] The recipients receive US$100,000, a citation certificate, and, since 1987, a bronze medallion.[1] The designs on the medal are inspired by the work of architect Louis Sullivan, while the Latin inspired inscription on the reverse of the medallion—*firmitas, utilitas, venustas* (English: firmness, commodity and delight)—is from Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius. Before 1987, a limited edition Henry Moore sculpture accompanied the monetary prize.[1]\n\n\nThe Executive Director of the prize, Manuela Lucá-Dazio,[7] solicits nominations from a range of people, including past Laureates, academics, critics and others \"with expertise and interest in the field of architecture.\" Lucá-Dazio explains the mission of Pritzker Prize, to acknowledge a living architect or architects for a body of built work that has produced a consistent and significant contribution to humanity and to the built environment through the art of architecture.[8]\n\n\nAny licensed architect can also make a personal application for the prize before November 1 every year. (In 1988 Gordon Bunshaft nominated himself for the award and eventually won it.)[9] The jury, consisting of five to nine \"experts ... recognized professionals in their own fields of architecture, business, education, publishing, and culture\", deliberates and early in the following year announce the winner.[6] The prize Chair is the 2016 Pritzker laureate Alejandro Aravena; earlier chairs were J. Carter Brown (1979–2002), the Lord Rothschild (2003–2004), the Lord Palumbo (2005–2015), Glenn Murcutt (2016–2018) and Stephen Breyer (2019–2020).[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\nInaugural winner Philip Johnson was cited \"for 50 years of imagination and vitality embodied in a myriad of museums, theaters, libraries, houses, gardens and corporate structures\".[11] The 2004 laureate Zaha Hadid was the first female prize winner.[12] Ryue Nishizawa became the youngest winner in 2010 at age 44.[13] Partners in architecture (in 2001, Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, in 2010, Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, in 2020, Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara, and in 2021, Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal) have shared the award.[14] In 1988, Gordon Bunshaft and Oscar Niemeyer were both separately honored with the award.[15] The 2017 winners, architects Rafael Aranda, Carme Pigem, and Ramón Vilalta were the first group of three to share the prize.[16][17]\n\n\n\n\n\nPritzker

Pritzker and his wife Cindy, the award is funded by the Pritzker family and sponsored by the Hyatt Foundation. It is considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes, and is often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nThe Pritzker Architecture Prize claims to be awarded \"irrespective of nationality, race, creed, or ideology\".[6] The recipients receive US$100,000, a citation certificate, and, since 1987, a bronze medallion.[1] The designs on the medal are inspired by the work of architect Louis Sullivan, while the Latin inspired inscription on the reverse of the medallion—*firmitas, utilitas, venustas* (English: firmness, commodity and delight)—is from Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius. Before 1987, a limited edition Henry Moore sculpture accompanied the monetary prize.[1]\n\n\nThe Executive Director of the prize, Manuela Lucá-Dazio,[7] solicits nominations from a range of people, including past Laureates, academics, critics and others \"with expertise and interest in the field of architecture.\" Lucá-Dazio explains the mission of Pritzker Prize, to acknowledge a living architect or architects for a body of built work that has produced a consistent and significant contribution to humanity and to the built environment through the art of architecture.[8]\n\n\nAny licensed architect can also make a personal application for the prize before November 1 every year. (In 1988 Gordon Bunshaft nominated himself for the award and eventually won it.)[9] The jury, consisting of five to nine \"experts ... recognized professionals in their own fields of architecture, business, education, publishing, and culture\", deliberates and early in the following year announce the winner.[6] The prize Chair is the 2016 Pritzker laureate Alejandro Aravena; earlier chairs were J. Carter Brown (1979–2002), the Lord Rothschild (2003–2004), the Lord Palumbo (2005–2015), Glenn Murcutt (2016–2018) and Stephen Breyer (2019–2020).[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\nInaugural winner Philip Johnson was cited \"for 50 years of imagination and vitality embodied in a myriad of museums, theaters, libraries, houses, gardens and corporate structures\".[11] The 2004 laureate Zaha Hadid was the first female prize winner.[12] Ryue Nishizawa became the youngest winner in 2010 at age 44.[13] Partners in architecture (in 2001, Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, in 2010, Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, in 2020, Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara, and in 2021, Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal) have shared the award.[14] In 1988, Gordon Bunshaft and Oscar Niemeyer were both separately honored with the award.[15] The 2017 winners, architects Rafael Aranda, Carme Pigem, and Ramón Vilalta were the first group of three to share the prize.[16][17]\n\n\n\n\n\nPritzker
