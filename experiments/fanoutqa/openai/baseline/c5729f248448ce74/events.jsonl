Its first and earliest edition was published in collaboration with *Times Higher Education* (*THE*) magazine as Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings, inaugurated in 2004 to provide an independent source of comparative data about university performance. In 2009, the two organizations parted ways to produce independent university rankings, the QS World University Rankings and THE World University Rankings. \n\n\nQS’ rankings portfolio have since been expanded to consist of the QS World University Rankings, the QS World University Rankings by Subject, four regional rankings tables including: Asia, Latin America, Europe, Central Asia, the Arab Region, several MBA rankings, and the QS Best Student Cities rankings. \n\n\nIn 2022, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Sustainability.[1]\n\n\nThe rankings are regarded as one of the most-widely read university rankings in the world, along with *Academic Ranking of World Universities* and *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*.[2]\n\n\nAccording to Alexa Internet, it is the most widely viewed university ranking worldwide.[3]\n\n\nThe ranking has been criticized for its overreliance on subjective indicators and reputation surveys, which tend to fluctuate over time and form a feedback loop.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\n\nConcerns also exist regarding the global consistency and integrity of the data used to generate the QS rankings.[5][9][10][11]\n\n\nThe development and production of the rankings is overseen by QS Senior Vice President Ben Sowter, who in 2016 was ranked in 40th position in Wonkhe's 2016 \"Higher Education Power List\", a list of what the organisation believed to be the 50 most influential figures in UK (United Kingdom) higher education.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nQS was founded by Nunzio Quacquarelli in 1990 to provide information and advice to students looking to study abroad. Since then, the company expanded to include a wider range of higher education-focused products and services before partnering with THE in 2004 to create the THE-QS World University Rankings. \n\n\nA perceived need for an international ranking of universities for UK purposes was highlighted in December 2003 in Richard Lambert's review of university-industry collaboration in Great Britain[13] for HM Treasury, the finance ministry of the United Kingdom. Amongst its recommendations were world university rankings, which Lambert said would help the UK gauge the global standing of its universities.\n\n\nBetween 2004 and 2009, QS produced the rankings in partnership with *THE*. In 2009, *THE* announced they would produce their own rankings, the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*, in partnership with Thomson Reuters. *THE* cited an asserted weakness in the methodology of the original rankings,[14] as well as a perceived favoritism in the existing methodology for science over the humanities,[15] as two of the key reasons for the decision to split with QS.\n\n\nQS retained intellectual property in the prior rankings and the methodology used to compile them,[*citation needed*] which it continued to develop and refine over subsequent iterations.[16]\n\n\n*THE* created a new methodology with Thomson Reuters, and published the first *Times Higher Education World University Rankings* in September 2010.\n\n\nQS publishes the rankings results in the world's media and has entered into partnerships with a number of outlets, including *The Guardian* in the United Kingdom, and *Chosun Ilbo* in South Korea. The first rankings produced by QS independently of *THE*, and using QS's methodology, were released in September 2010; the second rankings were released a year later, in September 2011.\n\n\nQS designed its rankings to assess performance according to what it believes to be key aspects of a university's mission: teaching, research, nurturing employability, and internationalisation.[17]\n\n\nQS has a global presence with offices in Europe, Asia, and the Americas and provides products and services related to student recruitment, events, and consulting services. In 2022, the firm's founder, Nunzio Quacquarelli, was appointed as the company's president. Jessica Turner serves as the company's chief executive officer, responsible for the firm's operations and strategy.[18]\n\n\n\n## Rankings[edit]\n\n\n### QS World University Rankings[edit]\n\n\nThe QS World University Rankings are released annually, typically in June. The 2023 edition featured 1418 institutions across 100 locations. The rankings are based on a methodology that considers a range of factors, including academic reputation, employer reputation, research impact, and internationalization. The methodology is reviewed annually to ensure that it remains relevant and up-to-date. The most recent methodology used by QS to calculate the rankings includes the following indicators:[19]\n\n\n\n#### Academic reputation[edit]\n\n\nAccounting for 40% of the overall score, academic reputation relates to academic excellence and the scholarly esteem in which the world’s universities are held. It collates more than 150,000 responses from academics in more than 140 countries and locations.[20][21] QS has previously published the job titles and geographical distribution of the participants in this survey.[21]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty/student ratio[edit]\n\n\nThis indicator accounts for 15% of a university's score in the rankings. It is a classic measure used in various ranking systems as an indication of staff resources afforded to students, including teaching capacity, class size, curriculum development, lab and seminar delivery, pastoral care, teaching capacity and class size. QS has admitted that it is a limited metric, particularly in the face of modern enhancements in online teaching methods and content distribution.[22]\n\n\n\n#### Citations/faculty[edit]\n\n\nCitations of published research are among the most widely used inputs to national and global university rankings. The QS World University Rankings used citation data from Thomson (now Thomson Reuters) from 2004 to 2007, and since then has used data from Scopus, part of Elsevier. The total number of citations for a five-year period is divided by the number of academics in a university to yield the score for this measure, which accounts for 20% of a university's score in the rankings. \n\n\nQS has explained that it uses this approach, rather than the citations per paper preferred for in other rankings systems because it reduces the impact of biomedical science on the overall picture – biomedicine has a ferocious \"publish or perish\" culture. Instead, QS attempts to measure the density of research-active staff at each institution, but issues remain about the use of citations in ranking systems, especially the fact that the arts and humanities generate comparatively few citations.[23]\n\n\nSince 2015, QS has made methodological enhancements designed to remove the advantage institutions specializing in the Natural Sciences or Medicine previously received. This enhancement is termed faculty area normalization and ensures that an institution's citations count in each of QS's five key Faculty Areas is weighted to account for 20% of the final citations score.[24]\n\n\nQS has conceded the presence of some data-collection errors regarding citations per faculty in previous years' rankings.[25]\n\n\nOne concern is the differences between the Scopus and Thomson Reuters databases. For major world universities, the two systems capture largely the same publications and citations. For less prominent institutions, Scopus has more non-English language and smaller-circulation journals in its database leading some critics to suggest that citation averages are skewed towards English-speaking universities.[23] This area has been criticized for undermining universities that do not use English as their primary language.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Employer reputation[edit]\n\n\nQS’ Employer Reputation indicator is obtained using another survey, like Academic Reputation, and accounts for 15% of an institution’s overall score. The most recent edition surveyed some 99,000 employers at companies and organisations that hire graduates on a significant or global scale. \n\n\nThis survey was introduced in 2005 in the belief that employers track graduate quality, making this a barometer of teaching quality and the level of work readiness acquired by students, a famously problematic factor to measure. University standing here is of special interest to potential students, and acknowledging this was the impetus behind the inaugural QS Graduate Employability Rankings, published in November 2015.[27][28] However, these rankings were subsequently discontinued in 2021, with its data rolled into the QS World University Rankings methodology.\n\n\n\n#### Internationalization[edit]\n\n\nThe final 10% of a university's score is derived from measures intended to capture their internationalization: half from their percentage of international students, and the other half from their percentage of international staff. This is of interest partly because it shows whether a university is putting effort into global collaboration and diversity, but also because it indicates global appeal for students and researchers around the world.[29]\n\n\nQS recently began distinguishing between International Faculty Ratio and International Student Ratio', both of which account for 5% of the total weightage. While the former evaluates the ratio of international faculty staff to overall staff, the latter assumes that Institutions that have a large number of international students should have better networking, cultural exchanges, a more diverse learning experience and alumni diversity. [30]\n\n\n\n#### Others factors[edit]\n\n\nBeginning with its 2024 rankings, QS implemented three new indicators to reflect the shifts in higher education, each of which accounts for 5% of the total weightage:\n\n\n\n* International Research Network, primarily referencing an institution's ability to create and sustain research partnerships and worldwide collaboration networks.\n\n\n* Employment Outcomes, reflecting an institution's ability to ensure a high level of employability for their graduates.\n\n\n* Sustainability, reflecting an institution's ability to demonstrate a sustainable existence.\n\n\n\n\nQS World University Rankings: Global Top 10\n| Institution | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![United States](image)Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University of Cambridge | 2 | 2 | 3 | 7 | 7 | 6 | 5\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University of Oxford | 3 | 4 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 6\n |\n| ![United States](image)Harvard University | 4 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3\n |\n| ![United States](image)Stanford University | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)Imperial College London | 6 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 8\n |\n| ![Switzerland](image)ETH Zurich | 7 | 9 | 8 | 6 | 6 | 7 | 10\n |\n| ![Singapore](image) National University of Singapore | 8 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 15\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University College London | 9 | 8 | 8 | 10 | 8 | 10 | 7\n |\n| ![United States](image)University of California, Berkeley | 10 | 27 | 32 | 30 | 28 | 27 | 27\n |\n\n\n### QS World University Rankings: Regional Rankings[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the World University Rankings, QS produces four regional rankings, including the Arab Region, Asia, Emerging Europe and Central Asia (discontinued), and Latin America. In 2023, QS will launch the QS World University Rankings: Europe. These editions include an expanded roster of ranked universities for each region than those featured in the QS World University Rankings which only feature the very best in location. \n\n\nWhile the same methodological indicators tend to be used for the regional rankings, the weightings are modified and additional lenses are included to account for the unique characteristics of each region. Additional metrics include incoming and outgoing exchange students, academic staff with a PhD, and web visibility. Accordingly, the performance of institutions within their respective regional rankings can differ significantly from the QS World University Rankings released in the same academic year.[31]\n\n\n\n#### Arab region[edit]\n\n\nFirst published in 2014, the annual *QS Arab Region University Rankings* highlights 199 leading universities across 18 countries in the Arab Region. The methodology for this ranking has been developed with the aim of reflecting specific challenges and priorities for institutions in the region, drawing on 10 indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\nQS World University Rankings: Arab Region: Top 10\n| Institution | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Saudi Arabia](image)King Abdulaziz University (KAU) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 4\n |\n| ![Qatar](image)Qatar University | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 7\n |\n| ![Saudi Arabia](image)King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 2\n |\n| ![Saudi Arabia](image)King Saud University | 4 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 4 | 3\n |\n| ![Lebanon](image)American University of Beirut (AUB) | 5 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1\n |\n| ![United Arab Emirates](image)United Arab Emirates University | 6 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5\n |\n| ![United Arab Emirates](image)Khalifa University | 7 | 9 | 9 | 12 | 15 | =21\n |\n| ![Oman](image)Sultan Qaboos University | 8 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 10 | 10\n |\n| ![United Arab Emirates](image)American University of Sharjah | 9 | 15 | 16 | 7 | 7 | =21\n |\n| ![Jordan](image)University of Jordan | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 9 | 9\n |\n\n\n#### Asia[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Asia in partnership with The Chosun Ilbo newspaper in Korea to rank universities in Asia independently. The 15th edition, released in 2022, ranked 760 universities, with inclusion based on the United Nations' M49 Standard.\n\n\n\n\n\nQS World University Rankings: Asia: Top 10\n| Institution | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![China](image)Peking University | 1 | 2 | 7 | 5 | 5 | 9\n |\n| ![Singapore](image)National University of Singapore (NUS) | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2\n |\n| ![China](image)Tsinghua University | 3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 6\n |\n| ![Hong Kong](image)The University of Hong Kong | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 5\n |\n| ![Singapore](image)Nanyang Technological University (NTU) | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 1\n |\n| ![China](image)Fudan University | 6 | 7 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 7\n |\n| ![China](image)Zhejiang University | 7 | 6 | 5 | 6 | 13 | 21\n |\n| ![South Korea](image)Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) | 8 | 14 | 12 | 9 | 8 | 4\n |\n| ![Malaysia](image)Universiti Malaya (UM) | 9 | 8 | 9 | 13 | 19 | 24\n |\n| ![China](image)Shanghai Jiao Tong University | 10 | 10 | 10 | 17 | 19 | 22\n |\n\n\n#### Emerging Europe and Central Asia (discontinued)[edit]\n\n\nFirst published in 2015, QS Emerging Europe and Central Asia Rankings included universities from mostly Eastern Europe and Central Asia, with Russia's Lomonosov Moscow State University in the top spot since its first publication. These rankings were discontinued in 2022.\n\n\n\n#### Latin America[edit]\n\n\nThe QS World University Rankings: Latin America were launched in 2011. The 2023 edition of the rankings features the top 428 universities in the region, accounting for 20 countries. The 2024 edition will expand these rankings to include Caribbean universities.\n\n\n\n\n\nQS World University Rankings: Latin America: Top 10\n| Institution | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Chile](image)Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (UC) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1\n |\n| ![Brazil](image)Universidade de São Paulo | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3\n |\n| ![Chile](image)Universidad de Chile | 3 | 3 | 4 | 7 | 7 | 6\n |\n| ![Mexico](image)Tecnológico de Monterrey | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 6 | 5\n |\n| ![Brazil](image)Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp) | 5 | 7 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 2\n |\n| ![Colombia](image)Universidad de los Andes | 6 | 5 | 6 | 4 | 5 | 8\n |\n| ![Mexico](image)Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) | 7 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 4 | 4\n |\n| ![Brazil](image)Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro | 8 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 7\n |\n| ![Argentina](image)Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA) | 9 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 9\n |\n| ![Colombia](image)Universidad Nacional de Colombia | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | =11\n |\n\n\n### QS World University Rankings by Subject[edit]\n\n\nTypically, QS’ first rankings release of the year is the QS World University Rankings by Subject which are usually published in March or April. \n\n\nThe rankings provide a detailed evaluation of universities based on their performance in more than 50 specific academic disciplines (Business, Mathematics, Medicine, Law, among others), as well as their performance in five broad faculty areas (Arts & Humanities, Engineering & Technology, Life Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences). \n\n\nThe QS World University Rankings by Subject was first introduced in 2011 and initially covered only five subject areas. Since then, the number of subjects has increased more than tenfold and is now considered one of the most comprehensive subject-focused rankings. \n\n\nWay before 2024 updates of core indicators used in the World University Rankings, the QS World University Rankings by Subject was already using International Research Network. In addition, Rankings by Subject also use H-Index, which assesses research productivity and impact within specific fields.\n\n\n\n\n\nCategories of QS World University Rankings by Faculty and Subject\n| Arts & Humanities | Engineering & Technology | Life Sciences & Medicine | Natural Sciences | Social Sciences\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Art & Design | Computer Science | Agriculture & Forestry | Biological Sciences | Accounting\n |\n| Architecture | Data Science | Anatomy | Chemistry | Business\n |\n| Archaeology | Engineering – Chemical | Anthropology | Earth & Marine Sciences | Communication\n |\n| Classics | Engineering – Civil | Dentistry | Environmental Sciences | Development Studies\n |\n| English Language | Engineering – Electrical | Medicine | Geography | Economics & Econometrics\n |\n| History | Engineering – Mechanical | Nursing | Geology | Education\n |\n| Performing Arts | Engineering – Mineral | Pharmacy | Geophysics | Hospitality & Leisure Management\n |\n| History of Art | Petroleum Engineering | Veterinary Science | Mathematics | Law\n |\n| Linguistics |  |  | Materials Science | Library Management\n |\n| Modern Languages |  |  | Physics | Marketing\n |\n| Philosophy |  |  |  | Politics\n |\n| Theology |  |  |  | Psychology\n |\n|  |  |  |  | Social Policy\n |\n|  |  |  |  | Sociology\n |\n|  |  |  |  | Sports-related Subjects\n |\n|  |  |  |  | Statistics\n |\n\n\n### QS Best Student Cities[edit]\n\n\nThe QS Best Student Cities rankings are an annual comparison of cities around the world based on their appeal and benefits to students who study there. \n\n\nLaunched in 2012, the rankings are based on a range of indicators that are designed to capture the experience of students living and studying in a particular city. \n\n\nThe methodology for QS Best Student Cities is based on five indicators:[32]\n\n\n\n* University Rankings – based on the performance of universities in a particular city, as measured by the QS World University Rankings.\n* Student Mix – looking at the student population's diversity as well as social and cultural activities.\n* Desirability – concerning factors such as safety, pollution and infrastructure.\n* Employer Activity – assessing employment opportunities for students in a particular city and the number of international companies based there.\n* Affordability – based on factors such as the cost of living, tuition fees and the availability of scholarships and financial support.\n\n\n\n\nQS Best Student Cities: Top 10\n| City | 2023 | 2022 | NA | NA | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)London | 1 | 1 |  |  | 1 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 2\n |\n| ![Germany](image)Munich | =2 | 2 |  |  | 4 | 6 | 9 | 11 | 14 | 10\n |\n| ![South Korea](image)Seoul | =2 | =3 |  |  | 10 | 10 | 4 | 10 | 10 | 14\n |\n| ![Switzerland](image)Zurich | 4 | 7 |  |  | 8 | 8 | 15 | 12 | 11 | =5\n |\n| ![Australia](image)Melbourne | 5 | 6 |  |  | 3 | 3 | 5 | 2 | 2 | =5\n |\n| ![Germany](image)Berlin | 6 | 5 |  |  | 5 | 7 | 6 | 9 | 16 | 11\n |\n| ![Japan](image)Tokyo | 7 | =3 |  |  | 2 | 2 | 7 | 3 | 7 | 17\n |\n| ![France](image)Paris | 8 | =9 |  |  | 7 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1\n |\n| ![Australia](image)Sydney | 9 | 8 |  |  | 9 | 9 | 13 | 4 | 4 | 4\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)Edinburgh | 10 | 12 |  |  | 15 | 16 | 18 | 33 | 26 | 32\n |\n\n\n### QS World University Rankings: Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Sustainability in response to the growing importance of sustainability in higher education and society at large. \n\n\nThe rankings are compiled using data collected through surveys as well as external sources such as the World Bank and the United Nations to provide a resource for students, academics and policymakers to assess universities’ sustainability performance and identify best practices for achieving sustainability goals. \n\n\nThe rank of the universities featured is determined by the sum of their scores in two categories: Environmental Impact and Social Impact, which are subdivided into eight indicators. These include: \n\n\n\n#### Environmental Impact (50%)[edit]\n\n\n* Sustainable Institutions (17.5% overall) – Concerns institutional strategy and operations directed towards an environmentally sustainable future.\n* Sustainable Education (20% overall) – This indicator assesses the extent to which institutions are educating students to both understand and make a difference to the environment.\n* Sustainable Research (12.5% overall) – Analyses the impact of an institution’s research in areas aligned to specific United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n\n#### Social Impact (50%)[edit]\n\n\n* Equality (15% overall) – Focuses on research output aligned to SDGs 5 and 10 (gender equality and reducing inequalities) as well as a range of diversity and measurable inclusivity elements.\n* Knowledge Exchange (10% overall) – Measures domestic and international collaboration in research to advance worldwide knowledge and academic standards.\n* Impact of Education (10% overall) – Concerns research output aligned to SDG 4, QS Academic and Alumni surveys, Academic Freedom Index, and the net flow of internationally mobile students and gross graduation ratio.\n* Employability and Opportunities (10% overall) – Assesses alumni outcomes and graduate employability.\n* Quality of Life (5% overall) – This indicator considers data pertaining to – among others – research output in specific SDGs (1,2,3, and 6), health options on campus, Air Quality Index, and Subjective Wellbeing Score, according to the OECD.\n\n\n\n\nQS World University Rankings: Sustainability: Top 10\n| University | 2023\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![United States](image)University of California, Berkeley | 1\n |\n| ![Canada](image)University of Toronto | 2\n |\n| ![Canada](image)University of British Columbia | 3\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University of Edinburgh | 4\n |\n| ![Australia](image)University of New South Wales (UNSW Sydney) | =5\n |\n| ![Australia](image)University of Sydney | =5\n |\n| ![Japan](image)University of Tokyo | 7\n |\n| ![United States](image)University of Pennsylvania | 8\n |\n| ![United States](image)Yale University | 9\n |\n| ![New Zealand](image)University of Auckland | 10\n |\n\n\n### QS Global MBA and Business Master’s Rankings[edit]\n\n\nOver the last three decades, QS has expanded its rankings portfolio to include business schools, MBAs and business master’s degrees. It launched QS Global MBA Rankings to provide students with a comprehensive list of the best MBA programmes worldwide, based on factors such as reputation, employability, and course content. \n\n\nThe QS Global MBA Rankings is now an annual publication released alongside its sister rankings, the QS Business Master’s Rankings and until 2023 the QS MBA by Career Specialisation Rankings (discontinued) These lists the world’s best master’s programmes for business-related subjects and MBAs for specific career options including Finance, Business Management, Business Analytics, Marketing and Supply Chain Management. \n\n\nCurrently, QS’ methodology for ranking MBAs and business master’s degrees is based on six indicators: \n\n\n\n* Employability (35% – 30% in Finance and Business Analytics)\n* Alumni Outcomes (15% – 20% in Finance and Business Analytics)\n* Return on Investment (20%)\n* Thought Leadership (15%)\n* Class and Faculty Diversity (10%)\n\n\nIn addition, QS produces two other annual MBA comparisons, the Online MBA Rankings[33] and the Executive MBA Rankings.[34]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2015, *The Guardian* referred to the QS World University Rankings as \"the most authoritative of their kind\".[35][36]\n\n\nIn September 2012, *The Independent* described the QS World University Rankings as being \"widely recognised throughout higher education as the most trusted international tables\".[37]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Angel Calderon, principal advisor for planning and research at RMIT University and a member of the QS Advisory Board, said, \"QS Latin American University Rankings has [sic] become the annual international benchmark universities use to ascertain their relative standing in the region\". He further stated that the 2016/17 edition of this ranking demonstrated improved stability.[38]\n\n\n\n## Criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe reputation surveys have received severe criticism. QS do not reveal the response rates for the survey, but statements from QS indicate that they are very low (2–8 %),[39] which would make the results highly unreliable. Other commentators have pointed at the low validity of the survey, since few people know much about the quality of teaching and research at other institutions but their own.[40][41][42][43][44]\n\n\n\nThe QS World University Rankings have been criticised by many for placing too much emphasis on reputation, which receives 50% of the overall score. Some people have expressed concern about the manner in which the academic reputation survey has been carried out.[45] In a report,[46] Peter Wills from the University of Auckland wrote of the *THE*-QS World University Rankings:\n\n\n> But we note also that this survey establishes its rankings by appealing to university staff, even offering financial enticements to participate (see Appendix II). Staff are likely to feel it is in their greatest interest to rank their own institution more highly than others. This means the results of the survey and any apparent change in ranking are highly questionable, and that a high ranking has no real intrinsic value in any case. We are vehemently opposed to the evaluation of the University according to the outcome of such PR competitions.\n> \n> \n\n\nLike many other international university rankings, QS uses a citation database to calculate some of its indicators. The use of these citations databases have been criticised, since they do not include research output from the humanities and social sciences to the same degree as the natural sciences, engineering and medicine.[40]\n\n\nIt has also been pointed out that the indicator 'faculty/student ratio' does not measure commitment to teaching, but rather research intensity, since a large share of the faculty typically spends most or all of their time doing research rather than teaching.[9]\n\n\nSince the split from *Times Higher Education* in 2009, further concerns about the methodology QS uses for its rankings have been brought up by several experts.\n\n\n\nIn October 2010, criticism of the old system came from Fred L. Bookstein, Horst Seidler, Martin Fieder, and Georg Winckler in the journal *Scientomentrics* for the unreliability of QS's methods: \n\n\n> Several individual indicators from the Times Higher Education Survey (THES) data base—the overall score, the reported staff-to-student ratio, and the peer ratings—demonstrate unacceptably high fluctuation from year to year. The inappropriateness of the summary tabulations for assessing the majority of the \"top 200\" universities would be apparent purely for reason of this obvious statistical instability regardless of other grounds of criticism. There are far too many anomalies in the change scores of the various indices for them to be of use in the course of university management.[6]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn September 2011, the *New Statesman* labeled the rankings \"The QS World University Rankings are a load of old baloney\" in a headline for an article by David Blanchflower, a labour economist, who wrote that, \"This ranking is complete rubbish and nobody should place any credence in it. The results are based on an entirely flawed methodology that underweights the quality of research and overweights fluff... The QS is a flawed index and should be ignored.\"[47]\n\n\nThe QS Subject Rankings have been dismissed as unreliable by Brian Leiter, who points out that programmes that are known to be high quality, and which rank highly in the Blackwell rankings (e.g., the University of Pittsburgh) fare poorly in the QS ranking for reasons that are not at all clear.[48]\n\n\nIn an article titled *The Globalisation of College and University Rankings* and appearing in the January/February 2012 issue of *Change*, Philip Altbach, professor of higher education at Boston College and also a member of the THE editorial board, said: \"The QS World University Rankings are the most problematical. From the beginning, the QS has relied on reputational indicators for half of its analysis … it probably accounts for the significant variability in the QS rankings over the years. In addition, QS queries employers, introducing even more variability and unreliability into the mix. Whether the QS rankings should be taken seriously by the higher education community is questionable.\"[49]\n\n\nIn June 2012, Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at the University of Melbourne and a member of the THE editorial board, said, \"I will not discuss the QS ranking because the methodology is not sufficiently robust to provide data valid as social science\".[50] On the QS website, QS's Intelligence Unit counter these criticisms by stating in the section on \"Statistical Validity\", reproduced here in completeness: \"Over 62,000 academic respondents contributed to our 2013 academic results, four times more than in 2010. Independent academic reviews have confirmed these results to be more than 99% reliable.\"[51]\n\n\nIn 2021, research published by the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, Berkeley raised the possibility that institutions that employ QS's consulting services are rewarded with improved rankings. QS denied the possibility and stated that it had firm policies and practices to minimize potential conflicts of interest.[52]\n\n\nDzulkifli Abdul Razak, former International Association of Universities president, questioned the reliability and relevance of the QS World University Rankings following release of an independent report from the United Nations University's International Institute for Global Health, which criticised its ranking system and discouraged governments from using these ranking systems in policy and decision making.[53]\n\n\nThe Independent Expert Group (IEG) convened by UNU-IIGH in November 2023 proved how universities that buy products and services from QS have better chances of moving up in those rankings.[54][55] Dzulkifli's statement sparked a lot of discussions within the academic sector in Malaysia, with some supporting his notion while others criticising it as being irrelevant itself.[56][57][58]\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nQS Quacquarelli Symonds organizes a range of international student recruitment events throughout the year. These are generally oriented towards introducing prospective students to university admissions staff, while also facilitating access to admissions advice and scholarships. In 2019, over 360 events were hosted, attended by 265,000 candidates, in 100 cities across 50 countries.\nSeparated into 'tours', QS' event offerings typically comprise a series of university and business school fairs.\n\n\n\n### World MBA Tour[edit]\n\n\nThe QS World MBA Tour is the world's largest series of international business school fairs, attended by more than 60,000 candidates in 100 cities across 50 countries.\n\n\n\n### World MBA Tour Premium[edit]\n\n\nQS World MBA Premium also focuses on MBA student recruitment, but invites only business schools ranked in the top 200 internationally, according to the QS World University Rankings. The event aims to provide a more holistic overview of an MBA degree, with enhanced focus on pre- and post-study processes and insights.\n\n\n\n### World Grad School Tour[edit]\n\n\nThe QS World Grad School Tour focuses on international postgraduate programs, particularly specialised master's degrees and PhDs in FAME (Finance, Accounting, Management and Economics) and STEM disciplines.\n\n\n\n### World University Tour[edit]\n\n\nThe QS World University Tour has an emphasis on undergraduate student recruitment, inviting undergraduate programs only.\n\n\n\n### Connect Events[edit]\n\n\nQS Connect MBA and QS Connect Masters differ from other event series' in that an open fair format is not followed. Instead, candidates take part in pre-arranged 1-to-1 interviews with admissions staff, based on pre-submitted CVs and academic profiles.\n\n\n\n## QS Stars[edit]\n\n\nQS also offers universities an auditing service that provides in-depth information about institutional strengths and weaknesses. Called QS Stars, this service is separate from the QS World University Rankings. It involves a detailed look at a range of functions which mark out a modern, global university. The minimum result that a university can receive is zero Stars, while truly exceptional, world-leading universities can receive '5\\*+', or 'Five Star Plus', status. The QS Stars audit process evaluates universities according to about 50 different indicators. By 2018, about 20 different universities worldwide had been awarded the maximum possible Five Star Plus rating.[59]\n\n\nQS Stars[60] ratings are derived from scores on in eight out of 12 categories. Four categories are mandatory, while institutions must choose the remaining four optional categories.[61] They are:\n\n\n\n* Teaching\n* Employability\n* Research\n* Internationalization\n* Facilities\n* Online/Distance Learning\n* Arts & Culture\n* Innovation\n* Inclusiveness\n* Social Responsibility\n* Subject Ranking\n* Program Strength[62]\n\n\nStars is an evaluation system, not a ranking. About 400 institutions had opted for the Stars evaluation as of early 2018. In 2012, fees to participate in this program were $9,850 for the initial audit and an annual license fee of $6,850.[63]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Academic Ranking of World Universities\n* Times Higher Education World University Rankings\n* U.S. News & World Report Best Global Universities Ranking\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Asian University Rankings – QS Asian University Rankings vs. QS World University Rankings™\".

Its first and earliest edition was published in collaboration with *Times Higher Education* (*THE*) magazine as Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings, inaugurated in 2004 to provide an independent source of comparative data about university performance. In 2009, the two organizations parted ways to produce independent university rankings, the QS World University Rankings and THE World University Rankings. \n\n\nQS’ rankings portfolio have since been expanded to consist of the QS World University Rankings, the QS World University Rankings by Subject, four regional rankings tables including: Asia, Latin America, Europe, Central Asia, the Arab Region, several MBA rankings, and the QS Best Student Cities rankings. \n\n\nIn 2022, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Sustainability.[1]\n\n\nThe rankings are regarded as one of the most-widely read university rankings in the world, along with *Academic Ranking of World Universities* and *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*.[2]\n\n\nAccording to Alexa Internet, it is the most widely viewed university ranking worldwide.[3]\n\n\nThe ranking has been criticized for its overreliance on subjective indicators and reputation surveys, which tend to fluctuate over time and form a feedback loop.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\n\nConcerns also exist regarding the global consistency and integrity of the data used to generate the QS rankings.[5][9][10][11]\n\n\nThe development and production of the rankings is overseen by QS Senior Vice President Ben Sowter, who in 2016 was ranked in 40th position in Wonkhe's 2016 \"Higher Education Power List\", a list of what the organisation believed to be the 50 most influential figures in UK (United Kingdom) higher education.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nQS was founded by Nunzio Quacquarelli in 1990 to provide information and advice to students looking to study abroad. Since then, the company expanded to include a wider range of higher education-focused products and services before partnering with THE in 2004 to create the THE-QS World University Rankings. \n\n\nA perceived need for an international ranking of universities for UK purposes was highlighted in December 2003 in Richard Lambert's review of university-industry collaboration in Great Britain[13] for HM Treasury, the finance ministry of the United Kingdom. Amongst its recommendations were world university rankings, which Lambert said would help the UK gauge the global standing of its universities.\n\n\nBetween 2004 and 2009, QS produced the rankings in partnership with *THE*. In 2009, *THE* announced they would produce their own rankings, the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*, in partnership with Thomson Reuters. *THE* cited an asserted weakness in the methodology of the original rankings,[14] as well as a perceived favoritism in the existing methodology for science over the humanities,[15] as two of the key reasons for the decision to split with QS.\n\n\nQS retained intellectual property in the prior rankings and the methodology used to compile them,[*citation needed*] which it continued to develop and refine over subsequent iterations.[16]\n\n\n*THE* created a new methodology with Thomson Reuters, and published the first *Times Higher Education World University Rankings* in September 2010.\n\n\nQS publishes the rankings results in the world's media and has entered into partnerships with a number of outlets, including *The Guardian* in the United Kingdom, and *Chosun Ilbo* in South Korea. The first rankings produced by QS independently of *THE*, and using QS's methodology, were released in September 2010; the second rankings were released a year later, in September 2011.\n\n\nQS designed its rankings to assess performance according to what it believes to be key aspects of a university's mission: teaching, research, nurturing employability, and internationalisation.[17]\n\n\nQS has a global presence with offices in Europe, Asia, and the Americas and provides products and services related to student recruitment, events, and consulting services. In 2022, the firm's founder, Nunzio Quacquarelli, was appointed as the company's president. Jessica Turner serves as the company's chief executive officer, responsible for the firm's operations and strategy.[18]\n\n\n\n## Rankings[edit]\n\n\n### QS World University Rankings[edit]\n\n\nThe QS World University Rankings are released annually, typically in June. The 2023 edition featured 1418 institutions across 100 locations. The rankings are based on a methodology that considers a range of factors, including academic reputation, employer reputation, research impact, and internationalization. The methodology is reviewed annually to ensure that it remains relevant and up-to-date. The most recent methodology used by QS to calculate the rankings includes the following indicators:[19]\n\n\n\n#### Academic reputation[edit]\n\n\nAccounting for 40% of the overall score, academic reputation relates to academic excellence and the scholarly esteem in which the world’s universities are held. It collates more than 150,000 responses from academics in more than 140 countries and locations.[20][21] QS has previously published the job titles and geographical distribution of the participants in this survey.[21]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty/student ratio[edit]\n\n\nThis indicator accounts for 15% of a university's score in the rankings. It is a classic measure used in various ranking systems as an indication of staff resources afforded to students, including teaching capacity, class size, curriculum development, lab and seminar delivery, pastoral care, teaching capacity and class size. QS has admitted that it is a limited metric, particularly in the face of modern enhancements in online teaching methods and content distribution.[22]\n\n\n\n#### Citations/faculty[edit]\n\n\nCitations of published research are among the most widely used inputs to national and global university rankings. The QS World University Rankings used citation data from Thomson (now Thomson Reuters) from 2004 to 2007, and since then has used data from Scopus, part of Elsevier. The total number of citations for a five-year period is divided by the number of academics in a university to yield the score for this measure, which accounts for 20% of a university's score in the rankings. \n\n\nQS has explained that it uses this approach, rather than the citations per paper preferred for in other rankings systems because it reduces the impact of biomedical science on the overall picture – biomedicine has a ferocious \"publish or perish\" culture. Instead, QS attempts to measure the density of research-active staff at each institution, but issues remain about the use of citations in ranking systems, especially the fact that the arts and humanities generate comparatively few citations.[23]\n\n\nSince 2015, QS has made methodological enhancements designed to remove the advantage institutions specializing in the Natural Sciences or Medicine previously received. This enhancement is termed faculty area normalization and ensures that an institution's citations count in each of QS's five key Faculty Areas is weighted to account for 20% of the final citations score.[24]\n\n\nQS has conceded the presence of some data-collection errors regarding citations per faculty in previous years' rankings.[25]\n\n\nOne concern is the differences between the Scopus and Thomson Reuters databases. For major world universities, the two systems capture largely the same publications and citations. For less prominent institutions, Scopus has more non-English language and smaller-circulation journals in its database leading some critics to suggest that citation averages are skewed towards English-speaking universities.[23] This area has been criticized for undermining universities that do not use English as their primary language.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Employer reputation[edit]\n\n\nQS’ Employer Reputation indicator is obtained using another survey, like Academic Reputation, and accounts for 15% of an institution’s overall score. The most recent edition surveyed some 99,000 employers at companies and organisations that hire graduates on a significant or global scale. \n\n\nThis survey was introduced in 2005 in the belief that employers track graduate quality, making this a barometer of teaching quality and the level of work readiness acquired by students, a famously problematic factor to measure. University standing here is of special interest to potential students, and acknowledging this was the impetus behind the inaugural QS Graduate Employability Rankings, published in November 2015.[27][28] However, these rankings were subsequently discontinued in 2021, with its data rolled into the QS World University Rankings methodology.\n\n\n\n#### Internationalization[edit]\n\n\nThe final 10% of a university's score is derived from measures intended to capture their internationalization: half from their percentage of international students, and the other half from their percentage of international staff. This is of interest partly because it shows whether a university is putting effort into global collaboration and diversity, but also because it indicates global appeal for students and researchers around the world.[29]\n\n\nQS recently began distinguishing between International Faculty Ratio and International Student Ratio', both of which account for 5% of the total weightage. While the former evaluates the ratio of international faculty staff to overall staff, the latter assumes that Institutions that have a large number of international students should have better networking, cultural exchanges, a more diverse learning experience and alumni diversity. [30]\n\n\n\n#### Others factors[edit]\n\n\nBeginning with its 2024 rankings, QS implemented three new indicators to reflect the shifts in higher education, each of which accounts for 5% of the total weightage:\n\n\n\n* International Research Network, primarily referencing an institution's ability to create and sustain research partnerships and worldwide collaboration networks.\n\n\n* Employment Outcomes, reflecting an institution's ability to ensure a high level of employability for their graduates.\n\n\n* Sustainability, reflecting an institution's ability to demonstrate a sustainable existence.\n\n\n\n\nQS World University Rankings: Global Top 10\n| Institution | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![United States](image)Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University of Cambridge | 2 | 2 | 3 | 7 | 7 | 6 | 5\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University of Oxford | 3 | 4 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 6\n |\n| ![United States](image)Harvard University | 4 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3\n |\n| ![United States](image)Stanford University | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)Imperial College London | 6 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 8\n |\n| ![Switzerland](image)ETH Zurich | 7 | 9 | 8 | 6 | 6 | 7 | 10\n |\n| ![Singapore](image) National University of Singapore | 8 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 11 | 15\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University College London | 9 | 8 | 8 | 10 | 8 | 10 | 7\n |\n| ![United States](image)University of California, Berkeley | 10 | 27 | 32 | 30 | 28 | 27 | 27\n |\n\n\n### QS World University Rankings: Regional Rankings[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the World University Rankings, QS produces four regional rankings, including the Arab Region, Asia, Emerging Europe and Central Asia (discontinued), and Latin America. In 2023, QS will launch the QS World University Rankings: Europe. These editions include an expanded roster of ranked universities for each region than those featured in the QS World University Rankings which only feature the very best in location. \n\n\nWhile the same methodological indicators tend to be used for the regional rankings, the weightings are modified and additional lenses are included to account for the unique characteristics of each region. Additional metrics include incoming and outgoing exchange students, academic staff with a PhD, and web visibility. Accordingly, the performance of institutions within their respective regional rankings can differ significantly from the QS World University Rankings released in the same academic year.[31]\n\n\n\n#### Arab region[edit]\n\n\nFirst published in 2014, the annual *QS Arab Region University Rankings* highlights 199 leading universities across 18 countries in the Arab Region. The methodology for this ranking has been developed with the aim of reflecting specific challenges and priorities for institutions in the region, drawing on 10 indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\nQS World University Rankings: Arab Region: Top 10\n| Institution | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Saudi Arabia](image)King Abdulaziz University (KAU) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 4\n |\n| ![Qatar](image)Qatar University | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 7\n |\n| ![Saudi Arabia](image)King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 2\n |\n| ![Saudi Arabia](image)King Saud University | 4 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 4 | 3\n |\n| ![Lebanon](image)American University of Beirut (AUB) | 5 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1\n |\n| ![United Arab Emirates](image)United Arab Emirates University | 6 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5\n |\n| ![United Arab Emirates](image)Khalifa University | 7 | 9 | 9 | 12 | 15 | =21\n |\n| ![Oman](image)Sultan Qaboos University | 8 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 10 | 10\n |\n| ![United Arab Emirates](image)American University of Sharjah | 9 | 15 | 16 | 7 | 7 | =21\n |\n| ![Jordan](image)University of Jordan | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 9 | 9\n |\n\n\n#### Asia[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Asia in partnership with The Chosun Ilbo newspaper in Korea to rank universities in Asia independently. The 15th edition, released in 2022, ranked 760 universities, with inclusion based on the United Nations' M49 Standard.\n\n\n\n\n\nQS World University Rankings: Asia: Top 10\n| Institution | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![China](image)Peking University | 1 | 2 | 7 | 5 | 5 | 9\n |\n| ![Singapore](image)National University of Singapore (NUS) | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2\n |\n| ![China](image)Tsinghua University | 3 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 6\n |\n| ![Hong Kong](image)The University of Hong Kong | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 5\n |\n| ![Singapore](image)Nanyang Technological University (NTU) | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 1\n |\n| ![China](image)Fudan University | 6 | 7 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 7\n |\n| ![China](image)Zhejiang University | 7 | 6 | 5 | 6 | 13 | 21\n |\n| ![South Korea](image)Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) | 8 | 14 | 12 | 9 | 8 | 4\n |\n| ![Malaysia](image)Universiti Malaya (UM) | 9 | 8 | 9 | 13 | 19 | 24\n |\n| ![China](image)Shanghai Jiao Tong University | 10 | 10 | 10 | 17 | 19 | 22\n |\n\n\n#### Emerging Europe and Central Asia (discontinued)[edit]\n\n\nFirst published in 2015, QS Emerging Europe and Central Asia Rankings included universities from mostly Eastern Europe and Central Asia, with Russia's Lomonosov Moscow State University in the top spot since its first publication. These rankings were discontinued in 2022.\n\n\n\n#### Latin America[edit]\n\n\nThe QS World University Rankings: Latin America were launched in 2011. The 2023 edition of the rankings features the top 428 universities in the region, accounting for 20 countries. The 2024 edition will expand these rankings to include Caribbean universities.\n\n\n\n\n\nQS World University Rankings: Latin America: Top 10\n| Institution | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Chile](image)Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (UC) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1\n |\n| ![Brazil](image)Universidade de São Paulo | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3\n |\n| ![Chile](image)Universidad de Chile | 3 | 3 | 4 | 7 | 7 | 6\n |\n| ![Mexico](image)Tecnológico de Monterrey | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 6 | 5\n |\n| ![Brazil](image)Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp) | 5 | 7 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 2\n |\n| ![Colombia](image)Universidad de los Andes | 6 | 5 | 6 | 4 | 5 | 8\n |\n| ![Mexico](image)Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) | 7 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 4 | 4\n |\n| ![Brazil](image)Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro | 8 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 7\n |\n| ![Argentina](image)Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA) | 9 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 9\n |\n| ![Colombia](image)Universidad Nacional de Colombia | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | =11\n |\n\n\n### QS World University Rankings by Subject[edit]\n\n\nTypically, QS’ first rankings release of the year is the QS World University Rankings by Subject which are usually published in March or April. \n\n\nThe rankings provide a detailed evaluation of universities based on their performance in more than 50 specific academic disciplines (Business, Mathematics, Medicine, Law, among others), as well as their performance in five broad faculty areas (Arts & Humanities, Engineering & Technology, Life Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences). \n\n\nThe QS World University Rankings by Subject was first introduced in 2011 and initially covered only five subject areas. Since then, the number of subjects has increased more than tenfold and is now considered one of the most comprehensive subject-focused rankings. \n\n\nWay before 2024 updates of core indicators used in the World University Rankings, the QS World University Rankings by Subject was already using International Research Network. In addition, Rankings by Subject also use H-Index, which assesses research productivity and impact within specific fields.\n\n\n\n\n\nCategories of QS World University Rankings by Faculty and Subject\n| Arts & Humanities | Engineering & Technology | Life Sciences & Medicine | Natural Sciences | Social Sciences\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Art & Design | Computer Science | Agriculture & Forestry | Biological Sciences | Accounting\n |\n| Architecture | Data Science | Anatomy | Chemistry | Business\n |\n| Archaeology | Engineering – Chemical | Anthropology | Earth & Marine Sciences | Communication\n |\n| Classics | Engineering – Civil | Dentistry | Environmental Sciences | Development Studies\n |\n| English Language | Engineering – Electrical | Medicine | Geography | Economics & Econometrics\n |\n| History | Engineering – Mechanical | Nursing | Geology | Education\n |\n| Performing Arts | Engineering – Mineral | Pharmacy | Geophysics | Hospitality & Leisure Management\n |\n| History of Art | Petroleum Engineering | Veterinary Science | Mathematics | Law\n |\n| Linguistics |  |  | Materials Science | Library Management\n |\n| Modern Languages |  |  | Physics | Marketing\n |\n| Philosophy |  |  |  | Politics\n |\n| Theology |  |  |  | Psychology\n |\n|  |  |  |  | Social Policy\n |\n|  |  |  |  | Sociology\n |\n|  |  |  |  | Sports-related Subjects\n |\n|  |  |  |  | Statistics\n |\n\n\n### QS Best Student Cities[edit]\n\n\nThe QS Best Student Cities rankings are an annual comparison of cities around the world based on their appeal and benefits to students who study there. \n\n\nLaunched in 2012, the rankings are based on a range of indicators that are designed to capture the experience of students living and studying in a particular city. \n\n\nThe methodology for QS Best Student Cities is based on five indicators:[32]\n\n\n\n* University Rankings – based on the performance of universities in a particular city, as measured by the QS World University Rankings.\n* Student Mix – looking at the student population's diversity as well as social and cultural activities.\n* Desirability – concerning factors such as safety, pollution and infrastructure.\n* Employer Activity – assessing employment opportunities for students in a particular city and the number of international companies based there.\n* Affordability – based on factors such as the cost of living, tuition fees and the availability of scholarships and financial support.\n\n\n\n\nQS Best Student Cities: Top 10\n| City | 2023 | 2022 | NA | NA | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)London | 1 | 1 |  |  | 1 | 1 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 2\n |\n| ![Germany](image)Munich | =2 | 2 |  |  | 4 | 6 | 9 | 11 | 14 | 10\n |\n| ![South Korea](image)Seoul | =2 | =3 |  |  | 10 | 10 | 4 | 10 | 10 | 14\n |\n| ![Switzerland](image)Zurich | 4 | 7 |  |  | 8 | 8 | 15 | 12 | 11 | =5\n |\n| ![Australia](image)Melbourne | 5 | 6 |  |  | 3 | 3 | 5 | 2 | 2 | =5\n |\n| ![Germany](image)Berlin | 6 | 5 |  |  | 5 | 7 | 6 | 9 | 16 | 11\n |\n| ![Japan](image)Tokyo | 7 | =3 |  |  | 2 | 2 | 7 | 3 | 7 | 17\n |\n| ![France](image)Paris | 8 | =9 |  |  | 7 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1\n |\n| ![Australia](image)Sydney | 9 | 8 |  |  | 9 | 9 | 13 | 4 | 4 | 4\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)Edinburgh | 10 | 12 |  |  | 15 | 16 | 18 | 33 | 26 | 32\n |\n\n\n### QS World University Rankings: Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Sustainability in response to the growing importance of sustainability in higher education and society at large. \n\n\nThe rankings are compiled using data collected through surveys as well as external sources such as the World Bank and the United Nations to provide a resource for students, academics and policymakers to assess universities’ sustainability performance and identify best practices for achieving sustainability goals. \n\n\nThe rank of the universities featured is determined by the sum of their scores in two categories: Environmental Impact and Social Impact, which are subdivided into eight indicators. These include: \n\n\n\n#### Environmental Impact (50%)[edit]\n\n\n* Sustainable Institutions (17.5% overall) – Concerns institutional strategy and operations directed towards an environmentally sustainable future.\n* Sustainable Education (20% overall) – This indicator assesses the extent to which institutions are educating students to both understand and make a difference to the environment.\n* Sustainable Research (12.5% overall) – Analyses the impact of an institution’s research in areas aligned to specific United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n\n#### Social Impact (50%)[edit]\n\n\n* Equality (15% overall) – Focuses on research output aligned to SDGs 5 and 10 (gender equality and reducing inequalities) as well as a range of diversity and measurable inclusivity elements.\n* Knowledge Exchange (10% overall) – Measures domestic and international collaboration in research to advance worldwide knowledge and academic standards.\n* Impact of Education (10% overall) – Concerns research output aligned to SDG 4, QS Academic and Alumni surveys, Academic Freedom Index, and the net flow of internationally mobile students and gross graduation ratio.\n* Employability and Opportunities (10% overall) – Assesses alumni outcomes and graduate employability.\n* Quality of Life (5% overall) – This indicator considers data pertaining to – among others – research output in specific SDGs (1,2,3, and 6), health options on campus, Air Quality Index, and Subjective Wellbeing Score, according to the OECD.\n\n\n\n\nQS World University Rankings: Sustainability: Top 10\n| University | 2023\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![United States](image)University of California, Berkeley | 1\n |\n| ![Canada](image)University of Toronto | 2\n |\n| ![Canada](image)University of British Columbia | 3\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University of Edinburgh | 4\n |\n| ![Australia](image)University of New South Wales (UNSW Sydney) | =5\n |\n| ![Australia](image)University of Sydney | =5\n |\n| ![Japan](image)University of Tokyo | 7\n |\n| ![United States](image)University of Pennsylvania | 8\n |\n| ![United States](image)Yale University | 9\n |\n| ![New Zealand](image)University of Auckland | 10\n |\n\n\n### QS Global MBA and Business Master’s Rankings[edit]\n\n\nOver the last three decades, QS has expanded its rankings portfolio to include business schools, MBAs and business master’s degrees. It launched QS Global MBA Rankings to provide students with a comprehensive list of the best MBA programmes worldwide, based on factors such as reputation, employability, and course content. \n\n\nThe QS Global MBA Rankings is now an annual publication released alongside its sister rankings, the QS Business Master’s Rankings and until 2023 the QS MBA by Career Specialisation Rankings (discontinued) These lists the world’s best master’s programmes for business-related subjects and MBAs for specific career options including Finance, Business Management, Business Analytics, Marketing and Supply Chain Management. \n\n\nCurrently, QS’ methodology for ranking MBAs and business master’s degrees is based on six indicators: \n\n\n\n* Employability (35% – 30% in Finance and Business Analytics)\n* Alumni Outcomes (15% – 20% in Finance and Business Analytics)\n* Return on Investment (20%)\n* Thought Leadership (15%)\n* Class and Faculty Diversity (10%)\n\n\nIn addition, QS produces two other annual MBA comparisons, the Online MBA Rankings[33] and the Executive MBA Rankings.[34]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2015, *The Guardian* referred to the QS World University Rankings as \"the most authoritative of their kind\".[35][36]\n\n\nIn September 2012, *The Independent* described the QS World University Rankings as being \"widely recognised throughout higher education as the most trusted international tables\".[37]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Angel Calderon, principal advisor for planning and research at RMIT University and a member of the QS Advisory Board, said, \"QS Latin American University Rankings has [sic] become the annual international benchmark universities use to ascertain their relative standing in the region\". He further stated that the 2016/17 edition of this ranking demonstrated improved stability.[38]\n\n\n\n## Criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe reputation surveys have received severe criticism. QS do not reveal the response rates for the survey, but statements from QS indicate that they are very low (2–8 %),[39] which would make the results highly unreliable. Other commentators have pointed at the low validity of the survey, since few people know much about the quality of teaching and research at other institutions but their own.[40][41][42][43][44]\n\n\n\nThe QS World University Rankings have been criticised by many for placing too much emphasis on reputation, which receives 50% of the overall score. Some people have expressed concern about the manner in which the academic reputation survey has been carried out.[45] In a report,[46] Peter Wills from the University of Auckland wrote of the *THE*-QS World University Rankings:\n\n\n> But we note also that this survey establishes its rankings by appealing to university staff, even offering financial enticements to participate (see Appendix II). Staff are likely to feel it is in their greatest interest to rank their own institution more highly than others. This means the results of the survey and any apparent change in ranking are highly questionable, and that a high ranking has no real intrinsic value in any case. We are vehemently opposed to the evaluation of the University according to the outcome of such PR competitions.\n> \n> \n\n\nLike many other international university rankings, QS uses a citation database to calculate some of its indicators. The use of these citations databases have been criticised, since they do not include research output from the humanities and social sciences to the same degree as the natural sciences, engineering and medicine.[40]\n\n\nIt has also been pointed out that the indicator 'faculty/student ratio' does not measure commitment to teaching, but rather research intensity, since a large share of the faculty typically spends most or all of their time doing research rather than teaching.[9]\n\n\nSince the split from *Times Higher Education* in 2009, further concerns about the methodology QS uses for its rankings have been brought up by several experts.\n\n\n\nIn October 2010, criticism of the old system came from Fred L. Bookstein, Horst Seidler, Martin Fieder, and Georg Winckler in the journal *Scientomentrics* for the unreliability of QS's methods: \n\n\n> Several individual indicators from the Times Higher Education Survey (THES) data base—the overall score, the reported staff-to-student ratio, and the peer ratings—demonstrate unacceptably high fluctuation from year to year. The inappropriateness of the summary tabulations for assessing the majority of the \"top 200\" universities would be apparent purely for reason of this obvious statistical instability regardless of other grounds of criticism. There are far too many anomalies in the change scores of the various indices for them to be of use in the course of university management.[6]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn September 2011, the *New Statesman* labeled the rankings \"The QS World University Rankings are a load of old baloney\" in a headline for an article by David Blanchflower, a labour economist, who wrote that, \"This ranking is complete rubbish and nobody should place any credence in it. The results are based on an entirely flawed methodology that underweights the quality of research and overweights fluff... The QS is a flawed index and should be ignored.\"[47]\n\n\nThe QS Subject Rankings have been dismissed as unreliable by Brian Leiter, who points out that programmes that are known to be high quality, and which rank highly in the Blackwell rankings (e.g., the University of Pittsburgh) fare poorly in the QS ranking for reasons that are not at all clear.[48]\n\n\nIn an article titled *The Globalisation of College and University Rankings* and appearing in the January/February 2012 issue of *Change*, Philip Altbach, professor of higher education at Boston College and also a member of the THE editorial board, said: \"The QS World University Rankings are the most problematical. From the beginning, the QS has relied on reputational indicators for half of its analysis … it probably accounts for the significant variability in the QS rankings over the years. In addition, QS queries employers, introducing even more variability and unreliability into the mix. Whether the QS rankings should be taken seriously by the higher education community is questionable.\"[49]\n\n\nIn June 2012, Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at the University of Melbourne and a member of the THE editorial board, said, \"I will not discuss the QS ranking because the methodology is not sufficiently robust to provide data valid as social science\".[50] On the QS website, QS's Intelligence Unit counter these criticisms by stating in the section on \"Statistical Validity\", reproduced here in completeness: \"Over 62,000 academic respondents contributed to our 2013 academic results, four times more than in 2010. Independent academic reviews have confirmed these results to be more than 99% reliable.\"[51]\n\n\nIn 2021, research published by the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, Berkeley raised the possibility that institutions that employ QS's consulting services are rewarded with improved rankings. QS denied the possibility and stated that it had firm policies and practices to minimize potential conflicts of interest.[52]\n\n\nDzulkifli Abdul Razak, former International Association of Universities president, questioned the reliability and relevance of the QS World University Rankings following release of an independent report from the United Nations University's International Institute for Global Health, which criticised its ranking system and discouraged governments from using these ranking systems in policy and decision making.[53]\n\n\nThe Independent Expert Group (IEG) convened by UNU-IIGH in November 2023 proved how universities that buy products and services from QS have better chances of moving up in those rankings.[54][55] Dzulkifli's statement sparked a lot of discussions within the academic sector in Malaysia, with some supporting his notion while others criticising it as being irrelevant itself.[56][57][58]\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nQS Quacquarelli Symonds organizes a range of international student recruitment events throughout the year. These are generally oriented towards introducing prospective students to university admissions staff, while also facilitating access to admissions advice and scholarships. In 2019, over 360 events were hosted, attended by 265,000 candidates, in 100 cities across 50 countries.\nSeparated into 'tours', QS' event offerings typically comprise a series of university and business school fairs.\n\n\n\n### World MBA Tour[edit]\n\n\nThe QS World MBA Tour is the world's largest series of international business school fairs, attended by more than 60,000 candidates in 100 cities across 50 countries.\n\n\n\n### World MBA Tour Premium[edit]\n\n\nQS World MBA Premium also focuses on MBA student recruitment, but invites only business schools ranked in the top 200 internationally, according to the QS World University Rankings. The event aims to provide a more holistic overview of an MBA degree, with enhanced focus on pre- and post-study processes and insights.\n\n\n\n### World Grad School Tour[edit]\n\n\nThe QS World Grad School Tour focuses on international postgraduate programs, particularly specialised master's degrees and PhDs in FAME (Finance, Accounting, Management and Economics) and STEM disciplines.\n\n\n\n### World University Tour[edit]\n\n\nThe QS World University Tour has an emphasis on undergraduate student recruitment, inviting undergraduate programs only.\n\n\n\n### Connect Events[edit]\n\n\nQS Connect MBA and QS Connect Masters differ from other event series' in that an open fair format is not followed. Instead, candidates take part in pre-arranged 1-to-1 interviews with admissions staff, based on pre-submitted CVs and academic profiles.\n\n\n\n## QS Stars[edit]\n\n\nQS also offers universities an auditing service that provides in-depth information about institutional strengths and weaknesses. Called QS Stars, this service is separate from the QS World University Rankings. It involves a detailed look at a range of functions which mark out a modern, global university. The minimum result that a university can receive is zero Stars, while truly exceptional, world-leading universities can receive '5\\*+', or 'Five Star Plus', status. The QS Stars audit process evaluates universities according to about 50 different indicators. By 2018, about 20 different universities worldwide had been awarded the maximum possible Five Star Plus rating.[59]\n\n\nQS Stars[60] ratings are derived from scores on in eight out of 12 categories. Four categories are mandatory, while institutions must choose the remaining four optional categories.[61] They are:\n\n\n\n* Teaching\n* Employability\n* Research\n* Internationalization\n* Facilities\n* Online/Distance Learning\n* Arts & Culture\n* Innovation\n* Inclusiveness\n* Social Responsibility\n* Subject Ranking\n* Program Strength[62]\n\n\nStars is an evaluation system, not a ranking. About 400 institutions had opted for the Stars evaluation as of early 2018. In 2012, fees to participate in this program were $9,850 for the initial audit and an annual license fee of $6,850.[63]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Academic Ranking of World Universities\n* Times Higher Education World University Rankings\n* U.S. News & World Report Best Global Universities Ranking\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Asian University Rankings – QS Asian University Rankings vs. QS World University Rankings™\".

Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science.\n\n\nFounded in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. MIT is one of three private land grant universities in the United States, the others being Cornell University and Tuskegee University. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMIT students refer to both their majors and classes using numbers or acronyms alone.[181] Departments and their corresponding majors are numbered in the approximate order of their foundation; for example, Civil and Environmental Engineering is Course 1, while Linguistics and Philosophy is Course 24.[182] Students majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), the most popular department, collectively identify themselves as \"Course 6\". MIT students use a combination of the department's course number and the number assigned to the class to identify their subjects; for instance, the introductory calculus-based classical mechanics course is simply \"8.01\" (pronounced *eight-oh-one*) at MIT.[183][c]\n\n\n\n### Undergraduate program[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n199. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"MIT Course Catalog: Freshman Year\".

MIT offers a comprehensive doctoral program with degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields as well as professional degrees, including the Master of Business Administration (MBA).[178] The Institute offers graduate programs leading to academic degrees such as the Master of Science (which is abbreviated as MS at MIT), various Engineer's Degrees, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), and Doctor of Science (DSc) and interdisciplinary graduate programs such as the MD-PhD (with Harvard Medical School) and a joint program in oceanography with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.[208][209][210][211]\n\n\nAdmission to graduate programs is decentralized; applicants apply directly to the department or degree program.

Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, an interview process was introduced as a component of consideration for admission. Interviews are performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors including potential for original thinking and creativity.[114] For exceptional candidates, a matriculation offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above.

The Union cited a \"values gap\" and threat to \"academic freedom and institutional autonomy\" following the release of internal UAE documents. Citing UAE's history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.[182]\n\n\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university's catering services.

Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople.[10][11] The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*. In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter granted by King Henry III.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics\n|  | 2022[98] | 2021[99] | 2020[100] | 2019[101] | 2018[102] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 22,470\n | 22,795\n | 20,426\n | 19,359\n | 18,378\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 18.9\n | 18.7\n | 23.1\n | 24.3\n | 24.8\n |\n| **Enrols** | 3,544\n | 3,660\n | 3,997\n | 3,528\n | 3,465\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 83.6\n | 85.9\n | 84.9\n | 75.2\n | 76.0\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 6.34\n | 6.23\n | 5.11\n | 5.49\n | 5.30\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[103] | —\n | 209\n | 207\n | 205\n | 212\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition\n| Domicile[104] and Ethnicity[105] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 47%\n | 47 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[b] | 21%\n | 21 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 23%\n | 23 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[106][107] |\n| Female | 50%\n | 50 |\n| Private School | 30%\n | 30 |\n| Low Participation Areas[c] | 5%\n | 5 |\n\n\n#### Process[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** \"About the Schools, Faculties & Departments\".

UAE also was behind the leak of over 50,000 phone numbers, including hundreds belonging to British citizens. Stephen Toope, the university's outgoing Vice-Chancellor, said the decision to suspend its collaboration with UAE also was a result of additional revelations about UAE's Pegasus software hacking.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Bonds[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge borrowed £350 million in October 2012 by issuing 40-year security bonds,[95] whose interest rate is approximately 0.6 percent higher than the British government's 40-year bond.[96]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Peterhouse Old Court](image)Peterhouse Old Court\n![](image)Great Court of Trinity College, dating back to the 16th Century\nAdmission to the University of Cambridge is competitive. In 2018–2019, for instance, 18.8% of applicants were admitted.[108][109] In 2021, Cambridge introduced an over-subscription clause to its offers of admission, which also permits the university to withdraw acceptances if too many students meet its selective entrance criteria. The clause can be invoked in the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university. The clause was introduced following a record number of A-level pupils obtained the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of A-level examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.[110][111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand took this into account when assessing university applicants.[133]\n\n\nWith the release of admissions figures, *The Guardian* reported in 2013 that ethnic minority candidates had lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white applicants. The university was criticised for what was seen as institutional discrimination against ethnic minority applicants in favour of white applicants. The university denied the claims of institutional discrimination, stating the figures did not take into account other variables.[134] A subsequent article reported that, in the years 2010 to 2012, ethnic minority applicants to medicine with 3 A\\* grades or higher were 20% less likely to gain admission than white applicants with similar grades. The university refused to provide figures for a wider range of subjects, claiming that assembling and releasing such information was excessively costly.[135]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSuch conflicts between Cambridge's residents and university students have largely disappeared since the 16th century, and the university has grown as a source of enormous employment and expanded wealth in Cambridge and the region.[47] The university also has proven a source of extraordinary growth in high tech and biotech start-ups and established companies and associated providers of services to these companies. The economic growth associated with the university's high tech and biotech growth has been labeled the Cambridge Phenomenon, and has included the addition of 1,500 new companies and as many as 40,000 new jobs added between 1960 and 2010, mostly at Silicon Fen, a business cluster launched by the university in the late 20th century.[48]\n\n\n\n### Myths, legends and traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Cambridge legends\n\nSee also: Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge\n\nFurther information: Nine Lessons and Carols and wooden spoon (award)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arts andHumanities | * English\n\t+ Anglo-Saxon Norse and Celtic\n* Architecture\n* CRASSH\n\t+ Existential Risk\n* Classics\n* Divinity\n* Music\n* Philosophy\n |\n| Biological sciences | * Genetics\n* Gurdon Institute\n* Physiology, Development and Neuroscience\n* Plant Sciences\n\t+ Botanic Garden\n* Sainsbury Laboratory\n* Stem Cell Institute\n |\n| Clinical Medicine | * Autism Research Centre\n* Cancer Unit\n* Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit\n* Mitochondrial Biology Unit\n* Oncology\n* Brain Imaging Centre\n |\n| Humanities and Social sciences | * Economics\n* Education\n* History\n* History and Philosophy of Science\n* Human, Social, and Political Science\n\t+ Archaeological Research\n\t+ Politics and International Studies\n* Law\n\t+ Criminology\n |\n| Physical sciences | * Astronomy\n* Chemistry\n* Earth Sciences\n\t+ Palaeoclimate Research\n* Geography\n\t+ Scott Polar Research Institute\n* Mathematical Sciences\n* Mathematics\n\t+ Theoretical Cosmology\n* Materials Science and Metallurgy\n* Physics\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA school in the University of Cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units. Each has an elected supervisory body known as a Council, composed of representatives of the various constituent bodies. The University of Cambridge maintains six such schools:[77]\n\n\n\n* Arts and Humanities\n* Biological Sciences\n* Clinical Medicine\n* Humanities and Social Sciences\n* Physical Sciences\n* Technology\n\nTeaching and research at the university is organised by faculties. The faculties have varying organisational substructures that partly reflect their respective histories and the university's operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions. A small number of bodies called syndicates hold responsibility for teaching and research, including for the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, the University Press, and the University Library.\n\n\n\n### Central administration[edit]\n\n\n#### Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university's School of Clinical Medicine is based in Addenbrooke's Hospital, where medical students undergo their three-year clinical placement period after obtaining their BA degree.[60] The West Cambridge site is undergoing a major expansion and will host new buildings and fields for university sports.[61] Since 1990, Cambridge Judge Business School, on Trumpington Street, provides management education courses and is consistently ranked among the top 20 business schools in the world by *Financial Times*.[62]\n\n\nGiven that the sites are in relative proximity and the area around Cambridge is reasonably flat, one of the favourite modes of transport for students is the bicycle; an estimated one-fifth of journeys in the city are made by bike, a figure enhanced by the fact that students are not permitted to hold car park permits except under special circumstances.[63]\n\n\n\n### Notable locations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university established its Local Examination Syndicate in 1858, now known as Cambridge University Press & Assessment after its merger with Cambridge University Press. It is the largest assessment agency in Europe. Cambridge University Press & Assessment plays a leading role in researching, developing, and delivering assessments around the world.[156]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Awards and prizes of the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge issues a number of prestigious awards and prizes annually to accomplished University of Cambridge faculty and students. It also issues some awards to those of varying global academic accomplishment regardless of whether their recipient is affiliated with the University of Cambridge.

Some claim they can improve chances for admission, though these claims have never been independently verified. None of these companies are affiliated with or endorsed by the University of Cambridge. The university informs applicants that all necessary information regarding the application process is publicly available through the university and none of these services is providing any insight not already publicly available to applicants.[136]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe college faculties are responsible for giving lectures, arranging seminars, performing research, and determining the syllabi for teaching, all of which is overseen by the university's general board. Together with the central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor, the college faculties make up the University of Cambridge. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels by the university. The Cambridge University Library is the university's largest and primary library. Squire Law Library is the primary library for the university's students of law. Individual colleges each maintain a multi-discipline library designed for each college's respective undergraduates.\n\n\nThe university is legally structured as an exempt charity and a common law corporation. Its corporate titles include the Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge.[64]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere were, as of the 2020–21 admissions cycle, only two grounds for compulsory pooling. For post-qualified applicants, their achieved grades at A level or equivalent and, for applicants with overseas interviews, an interview score of at least eight is achieved in all interviews. The second criterion does not apply to medicine applicants.[123] Previously, AS-Level UMS have been used as pooling criteria, but after A-levels became linear this was discontinued.[123]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese terms are shorter than those of many other British universities.[143] Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacation holiday periods, which are referred to by the university as vacations rather than holidays; students vacate the premises during these periods but are still expected to be pursuing studies and assignments.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: A Classical Adventure: The Architectural History of Downing College, Cambridge; Cambridge Medical School building; Cambridge Observatory; Cambridge University Library; Cambridge University Real Tennis Club; Fitzwilliam Museum; Goldie Boathouse; Lady Mitchell Hall; Old Schools; Senate House, Cambridge; Scott Polar Research Institute; University of Cambridge Sports Centre; and William Gates Building, Cambridge\n\nThe university occupies a central location within the city of Cambridge. University of Cambridge students represent approximately 20 percent of the town's population, which was 145,674 as of 2021, and contributes on whole to a lower age demographic in the city.[52]\n\n\nMost of the university's older colleges are located near the city centre through which River Cam flows. Students and others traditionally punt on the River Cam, which provides views of the university's buildings and campuses that surround the river.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** \"Trinity Hall's Steamboat Ladies\".

Until the 1980s, candidates for all subjects were required to take special entrance examinations,[116] which have since been replaced by additional tests for some subjects, such as the Thinking Skills Assessment and Cambridge Law Test.[117] The university has at times considered reintroducing an admissions exam for all subjects.[118]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2018 and later years, the university has come under some criticism and faced legal challenges over alleged sexual harassment at the university.[41][42] In 2019, for example, former student Danielle Bradford, represented by sexual harassment lawyer Ann Olivarius, sued the university for its handling of her sexual misconduct complaint. \"I was told that I should think about it very carefully because making a complaint could affect my place in my department,\" Bradford alleged in 2019.[43] In 2020, hundreds of current and former students accused the university in a letter, citing \"a complete failure\" to deal with sexual misconduct complaints.[44]\n\n\n\n### Town and gown[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Town and gown\n\nFurther information: Away with the learning of clerks, away with it! and Silicon Fen\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCritics have argued that the relative lower percent of state school applicants with the required grades for admission to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on Oxford and Cambridge's collective reputation, though both universities have encouraged pupils from state schools to apply to help redress the perceived imbalance.[129] Others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate social engineering.[130][131] The proportion of undergraduates drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, constituting, as of 2020, 26% of total admissions among the university's 3,436 applicants from independent schools compared to 23% of the 9,237 applications from state schools.[132] Cambridge, together with Oxford and Durham, was among those universities that adopted formulae in 2009 to rate the GCSE performance of schools, using data from the Department for Children, Schools and Families, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther student publications include *The Cambridge Student*, which is funded by Cambridge Students' Union and is published fortnightly, *The Tab*, and *The Mays* Founded by two University of Cambridge students in 2009, *The Tab* is an online media outlet featuring light-hearted features content. *The Mays* is a literary anthology including student prose, poetry, and visual art from both University of Cambridge and Oxford students. Founded in 1992 by three Cambridge students, the anthology publishes once a year and is overseen by Varsity Publications Ltd., the same body responsible for *Varsity*. Another literary journal, *Notes*, is published roughly twice per term. Additionally, many colleges have their own student-run publications.\n\n\nThe student radio station, Cam FM, is run jointly by University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University students. The station holds an FM licence (frequency 97.2 MHz), and hosts a mixture of music, talk, and sports shows.\n\n\n\n### Student Union[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEach year, approximately 3,500 applicants receive offers from their preference college and a further 1,000 to 1,100 applicants are offered admission by another college through the pool. On average, one in five applicants is pooled and around one in four pooled applicants receives an offer of admission.[121]\n\n\nStatistics released by the university show that some colleges regularly receive particularly high numbers of applicants, and these colleges tend to take fewer applicants from the pool. Other colleges regularly draw a greater proportion of their undergraduate intake from the pool.[124]\n\n\n\n#### Access[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOther museums include the Museum of Classical Archaeology, Whipple Museum of the History of Science, Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences, the university's geology museum, which displays some of Darwin's geological specimens and equipment (Darwin had studied under Adam Sedgwick, and wrote \"I a geologist\" in a notebook in 1838), and Polar Museum, part of the Scott Polar Research Institute, which is dedicated to Captain Scott and his men and focuses on the exploration of the Polar Regions.\n\n\nCambridge University Botanic Garden, created in 1831, is the university's botanical garden.\n\n\n\n### Publishing and assessments[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge University Press\n\nThe university's publishing arm, Cambridge University Press & Assessment, is the oldest printer and publisher in the world and the second largest university press in the world.[153] [154] It is also the largest department of the university by financial income, reporting income above £800 million.

The university's examination in mathematics, known as the Mathematical Tripos,[25] was initially compulsory for all undergraduates studying for the Bachelor of Arts degree, the most common degree first offered at Cambridge. From the time of Isaac Newton in the late 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained an especially strong emphasis on applied mathematics, and especially mathematical physics. Students awarded first class honours after completing the mathematics Tripos exam are called wranglers, and the top student among them is known as the Senior Wrangler, a position that has been described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain.\"[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Cambridge Students' Union\n\nAll students at the University of Cambridge are represented by Cambridge Students' Union, which was founded in 2020 as a merger of two student unions, Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU) and the Graduate Union (GU). CUSU previously represented all University students, and GU represented graduate students.[178][179]\n\n\nThe eight most important positions in Cambridge Students' Union are occupied by sabbatical officers.[180] In 2020, the sabbatical officers were elected with a turnout of 20.88% of the whole student body.[181]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther significant university alumni in science include Henry Cavendish, who discovered hydrogen; Frank Whittle, co-inventor of the jet engine; William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), who formulated the original Laws of Thermodynamics; William Fox Talbot, who invented the camera, Alfred North Whitehead, Einstein's major opponent; Jagadish Chandra Bose, one of the fathers of radio science; Lord Rayleigh, who made extensive contributions to both theoretical and experimental physics in the 20th century; and Georges Lemaître, who first proposed the Big Bang theory.\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge has a strong reputation in the field of politics, having educated:[188]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** Vitullo-Martin, J.

Teaching, and the fees it earned, nearly came to a halt during World War I, and severe financial difficulties followed. As a result, the university received its first systematic state support in 1919, and a Royal commission was appointed in 1920 to recommend that the university (but not its colleges) begin receiving an annual grant.[33] Following World War II, the university experienced a rapid expansion in applications and enrollment, partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.[34] This was not without controversies, however. For example, Cambridge researchers were accused in 2023 of helping to develop weapon systems for Iran.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Parliamentary representation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter presentation, the graduate is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor, who clasps them and then confers the degree through the following Latin statement, known as the Trinitarian formula (*in nomine Patris*), which may be omitted at the request of the graduand:\n\n\n\"*Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum \\_\\_\\_\\_, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti*, which translates in English as: \"By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of \\_\\_\\_\\_, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\"\n\n\nThe new graduate then rises, bows, and leaves the Senate House through the Doctor's door in Senate House Passage, where they receive their degree certificate.[148]\n\n\nFor the Cambridge Master of Arts, the degree is not awarded by merit of study, but by right following six years and one term after matriculation.\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Libraries of the University of Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCompulsory pooling criteria for post-qualified candidates\n| Qualification Type\n | Minimum grades\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A-Levels | A\\*A\\*A\\*\n | For science applicants, at least three A\\*s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| International Baccalaureate | 43 points overall with 776 at higher level or\n42 points overall with 777 at higher level\n | For science applicants, at least two 7s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| Scottish Advanced Highers | A1A1A1\n | For science applicants, at least 3 A1s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Cambridge Sports Centre opened in August 2013.

In *The Reeve's Tale*, the two main fictional characters are students at a University of Cambridge college called Soler Halle, which is believed to refer to King's Hall and is now part of Trinity College.[192]\n\n\nThe university has been the setting for all or parts of numerous novels, including Douglas Adams' *Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency*, Rose Macaulay's *They Were Defeated*,[193] and Tom Sharpe's *Porterhouse Blue*.[194]\n\n\nOther notable examples of the University of Cambridge in popular culture include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEnough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university's formation.[16][17][18]\n\n\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set *secundum consuetudinem universitatis*, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNotable University of Cambridge buildings include King's College Chapel,[54] the history faculty building[55] designed by James Stirling, and the Cripps Building at St John's College.[56] The brickwork of several colleges is notable: Queens' College has some of the earliest patterned brickwork in England[57] and the brick walls of St John's College are examples of English bond, Flemish bond, and Running bond.[58]\n\n\n\n### Sites[edit]\n\n\nThe university is divided into several sites, which house the university's various departments, including:[59]\n\n\n\n* Addenbrooke's Hospital\n* Downing Site\n* Madingley/Gorton\n* New Museums Site\n* North West Cambridge Development\n* Old Addenbrooke's Site\n* Old Schools\n* Silver Street/Mill Lane\n* Sidgwick Site\n* West Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCosts to students for room and board vary considerably from college to college.[70][71] Similarly, the investment in student education by each college at the university varies widely between the colleges.[72]\n\n\nThree theological colleges at the university, Westcott House, Westminster College, and Ridley Hall Theological College, are members of the Cambridge Theological Federation and associated in partnership with university.[73]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's 31 colleges are:[74]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHughes Hall and Fenner's\n* ![Bredon House at Wolfson College](image)\n\nBredon House at Wolfson College\n* ![St Edmund's College](image)\n\nSt Edmund's College\n* ![West Lodge Garden at Downing College](image)\n\nWest Lodge Garden at Downing College\n* ![Old Gatehouse at Queen's College](image)\n\nOld Gatehouse at Queen's College\n* ![Dining Hall at Magdalene College](image)\n\nDining Hall at Magdalene College\n* ![Chapel Court at Jesus College](image)\n\nChapel Court at Jesus College\n* ![Second Court at St John's College](image)\n\nSecond Court at St John's College\n* ![Trinity Hall](image)\n\nTrinity Hall\n* ![The Cavendish Building at Homerton College](image)\n\nThe Cavendish Building at Homerton College\n* ![Darwin College](image)\n\nDarwin College\n* ![The chapel at Sidney Sussex College](image)\n\nThe chapel at Sidney Sussex College\n* ![The interior of Judge Business School](image)\n\nThe interior of Judge Business School\n* ![The Grove at Fitzwilliam College](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_LmUPGuCKXX7D9U344FigYYjh","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

On the other hand, they have fewer weeks in the academic year than other universities, so the extent to which this is so may be exaggerated by these results.\n144. **^** \"Undergraduate Study – How will I be taught\".

Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, an interview process was introduced as a component of consideration for admission. Interviews are performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors including potential for original thinking and creativity.[114] For exceptional candidates, a matriculation offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above.

The Union cited a \"values gap\" and threat to \"academic freedom and institutional autonomy\" following the release of internal UAE documents. Citing UAE's history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.[182]\n\n\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university's catering services. The students backed vegan food in response to threats to the climate and biodiversity. The vote is non-binding since the university controls the catering service.[183] After the vote, Darwin College decided to serve only vegan food at its May Ball in 2023.[184]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and academics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. **^** \"Trinity College Accommodation Guide\".

In 2018–2019, for instance, 18.8% of applicants were admitted.[108][109] In 2021, Cambridge introduced an over-subscription clause to its offers of admission, which also permits the university to withdraw acceptances if too many students meet its selective entrance criteria. The clause can be invoked in the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university. The clause was introduced following a record number of A-level pupils obtained the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of A-level examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.[110][111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand took this into account when assessing university applicants.[133]\n\n\nWith the release of admissions figures, *The Guardian* reported in 2013 that ethnic minority candidates had lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white applicants. The university was criticised for what was seen as institutional discrimination against ethnic minority applicants in favour of white applicants. The university denied the claims of institutional discrimination, stating the figures did not take into account other variables.[134] A subsequent article reported that, in the years 2010 to 2012, ethnic minority applicants to medicine with 3 A\\* grades or higher were 20% less likely to gain admission than white applicants with similar grades. The university refused to provide figures for a wider range of subjects, claiming that assembling and releasing such information was excessively costly.[135]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSuch conflicts between Cambridge's residents and university students have largely disappeared since the 16th century, and the university has grown as a source of enormous employment and expanded wealth in Cambridge and the region.[47] The university also has proven a source of extraordinary growth in high tech and biotech start-ups and established companies and associated providers of services to these companies. The economic growth associated with the university's high tech and biotech growth has been labeled the Cambridge Phenomenon, and has included the addition of 1,500 new companies and as many as 40,000 new jobs added between 1960 and 2010, mostly at Silicon Fen, a business cluster launched by the university in the late 20th century.[48]\n\n\n\n### Myths, legends and traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Cambridge legends\n\nSee also: Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge\n\nFurther information: Nine Lessons and Carols and wooden spoon (award)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arts andHumanities | * English\n\t+ Anglo-Saxon Norse and Celtic\n* Architecture\n* CRASSH\n\t+ Existential Risk\n* Classics\n* Divinity\n* Music\n* Philosophy\n |\n| Biological sciences | * Genetics\n* Gurdon Institute\n* Physiology, Development and Neuroscience\n* Plant Sciences\n\t+ Botanic Garden\n* Sainsbury Laboratory\n* Stem Cell Institute\n |\n| Clinical Medicine | * Autism Research Centre\n* Cancer Unit\n* Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit\n* Mitochondrial Biology Unit\n* Oncology\n* Brain Imaging Centre\n |\n| Humanities and Social sciences | * Economics\n* Education\n* History\n* History and Philosophy of Science\n* Human, Social, and Political Science\n\t+ Archaeological Research\n\t+ Politics and International Studies\n* Law\n\t+ Criminology\n |\n| Physical sciences | * Astronomy\n* Chemistry\n* Earth Sciences\n\t+ Palaeoclimate Research\n* Geography\n\t+ Scott Polar Research Institute\n* Mathematical Sciences\n* Mathematics\n\t+ Theoretical Cosmology\n* Materials Science and Metallurgy\n* Physics\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA school in the University of Cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units.

The faculties have varying organisational substructures that partly reflect their respective histories and the university's operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions. A small number of bodies called syndicates hold responsibility for teaching and research, including for the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, the University Press, and the University Library.\n\n\n\n### Central administration[edit]\n\n\n#### Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university's School of Clinical Medicine is based in Addenbrooke's Hospital, where medical students undergo their three-year clinical placement period after obtaining their BA degree.[60] The West Cambridge site is undergoing a major expansion and will host new buildings and fields for university sports.[61] Since 1990, Cambridge Judge Business School, on Trumpington Street, provides management education courses and is consistently ranked among the top 20 business schools in the world by *Financial Times*.[62]\n\n\nGiven that the sites are in relative proximity and the area around Cambridge is reasonably flat, one of the favourite modes of transport for students is the bicycle; an estimated one-fifth of journeys in the city are made by bike, a figure enhanced by the fact that students are not permitted to hold car park permits except under special circumstances.[63]\n\n\n\n### Notable locations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university established its Local Examination Syndicate in 1858, now known as Cambridge University Press & Assessment after its merger with Cambridge University Press. It is the largest assessment agency in Europe. Cambridge University Press & Assessment plays a leading role in researching, developing, and delivering assessments around the world.[156]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Awards and prizes of the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge issues a number of prestigious awards and prizes annually to accomplished University of Cambridge faculty and students. It also issues some awards to those of varying global academic accomplishment regardless of whether their recipient is affiliated with the University of Cambridge. Some of these awards and prizes rank among the world's most estimable academic and intellectual accomplishments.

Some claim they can improve chances for admission, though these claims have never been independently verified. None of these companies are affiliated with or endorsed by the University of Cambridge. The university informs applicants that all necessary information regarding the application process is publicly available through the university and none of these services is providing any insight not already publicly available to applicants.[136]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe college faculties are responsible for giving lectures, arranging seminars, performing research, and determining the syllabi for teaching, all of which is overseen by the university's general board. Together with the central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor, the college faculties make up the University of Cambridge. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels by the university. The Cambridge University Library is the university's largest and primary library. Squire Law Library is the primary library for the university's students of law. Individual colleges each maintain a multi-discipline library designed for each college's respective undergraduates.\n\n\nThe university is legally structured as an exempt charity and a common law corporation. Its corporate titles include the Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge.[64]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere were, as of the 2020–21 admissions cycle, only two grounds for compulsory pooling. For post-qualified applicants, their achieved grades at A level or equivalent and, for applicants with overseas interviews, an interview score of at least eight is achieved in all interviews. The second criterion does not apply to medicine applicants.[123] Previously, AS-Level UMS have been used as pooling criteria, but after A-levels became linear this was discontinued.[123]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese terms are shorter than those of many other British universities.[143] Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacation holiday periods, which are referred to by the university as vacations rather than holidays; students vacate the premises during these periods but are still expected to be pursuing studies and assignments.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: A Classical Adventure: The Architectural History of Downing College, Cambridge; Cambridge Medical School building; Cambridge Observatory; Cambridge University Library; Cambridge University Real Tennis Club; Fitzwilliam Museum; Goldie Boathouse; Lady Mitchell Hall; Old Schools; Senate House, Cambridge; Scott Polar Research Institute; University of Cambridge Sports Centre; and William Gates Building, Cambridge\n\nThe university occupies a central location within the city of Cambridge. University of Cambridge students represent approximately 20 percent of the town's population, which was 145,674 as of 2021, and contributes on whole to a lower age demographic in the city.[52]\n\n\nMost of the university's older colleges are located near the city centre through which River Cam flows. Students and others traditionally punt on the River Cam, which provides views of the university's buildings and campuses that surround the river.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** \"Trinity Hall's Steamboat Ladies\".

Additionally, many colleges have their own student-run publications.\n\n\nThe student radio station, Cam FM, is run jointly by University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University students. The station holds an FM licence (frequency 97.2 MHz), and hosts a mixture of music, talk, and sports shows.\n\n\n\n### Student Union[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEach year, approximately 3,500 applicants receive offers from their preference college and a further 1,000 to 1,100 applicants are offered admission by another college through the pool. On average, one in five applicants is pooled and around one in four pooled applicants receives an offer of admission.[121]\n\n\nStatistics released by the university show that some colleges regularly receive particularly high numbers of applicants, and these colleges tend to take fewer applicants from the pool. Other colleges regularly draw a greater proportion of their undergraduate intake from the pool.[124]\n\n\n\n#### Access[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOther museums include the Museum of Classical Archaeology, Whipple Museum of the History of Science, Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences, the university's geology museum, which displays some of Darwin's geological specimens and equipment (Darwin had studied under Adam Sedgwick, and wrote \"I a geologist\" in a notebook in 1838), and Polar Museum, part of the Scott Polar Research Institute, which is dedicated to Captain Scott and his men and focuses on the exploration of the Polar Regions.\n\n\nCambridge University Botanic Garden, created in 1831, is the university's botanical garden.\n\n\n\n### Publishing and assessments[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge University Press\n\nThe university's publishing arm, Cambridge University Press & Assessment, is the oldest printer and publisher in the world and the second largest university press in the world.[153] [154] It is also the largest department of the university by financial income, reporting income above £800 million.

The University of Cambridge's rowing competition against Oxford is known as Boat Race. Varsity matches against Oxford also exist in other sports, including cricket, rugby, chess, and tiddlywinks. Athletes who representing the university in a varsity match are entitled to a Blue or a Half Blue, depending on the sport and other criteria.[176]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the exam period, May Week is held during which it is customary to celebrate by attending May Balls, which are all-night lavish parties held in the colleges where food, drinks, and entertainment are provided. So-called Suicide Sunday, the first day of May Week, is a popular date for garden parties.[173]\n\n\n\n### JCR and MCR[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to university-wide representation, students can participate in their own college student unions, which are known as Junior Combination Room (JCR) for undergraduates and Middle Combination Room (MCR) for post-graduates. These serve as a link between college staff and members and include officers elected annually between the fellow students; individual JCR and MCRs also report to Cambridge Students' Union, which offers training courses for some of the positions within the body.[174]\n\n\n\n### Societies[edit]\n\n\nMain page: Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Cambridge Union and Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe University of Cambridge has research departments and teaching faculties in nearly every academic discipline, and ll research and lectures are conducted by university departments. The colleges are charged with giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s, the University of Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues.[147] From 2000 to 2006, the University of Cambridge maintained a research partnership with MIT in the United States, known as the Cambridge–MIT Institute, which was discontinued after evolving into what is now called the CMI Partnership Programme.\n\n\n\n### Graduation tradition and ceremony[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Stephen Fry at Cambridge Union, the world's oldest continuing running debate society\nNumerous student-run societies exist at the University of Cambridge designed to encourage students who share common passions or interests to periodically meet or discuss these interests. As of 2010[update], there were 751 registered societies at the university.[175] In addition to these, individual colleges often promote their own societies and sports teams.\n\n\nAlthough technically independent from the university, Cambridge Union, a globally-renowned debate organization and the oldest debate organization in the world, offers students high-level debate and public speaking experience. Drama societies include the Amateur Dramatic Club (ADC) and the comedy club Footlights, whose alumni include many well-known show business personalities. The university's Chamber Orchestra, composed entirely of university students, offers a range of orchestra programs, including symphonies.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Zutshi, Patrick (2012). \"The Dispersal of Scholars from Oxford and the Beginnings of a University at Cambridge: A Study of the Sources\". *The English Historical Review*. **127** (528): 1041–1062. doi:10.1093/ehr/ces209.

The university's examination in mathematics, known as the Mathematical Tripos,[25] was initially compulsory for all undergraduates studying for the Bachelor of Arts degree, the most common degree first offered at Cambridge. From the time of Isaac Newton in the late 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained an especially strong emphasis on applied mathematics, and especially mathematical physics. Students awarded first class honours after completing the mathematics Tripos exam are called wranglers, and the top student among them is known as the Senior Wrangler, a position that has been described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain.\"[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Cambridge Students' Union\n\nAll students at the University of Cambridge are represented by Cambridge Students' Union, which was founded in 2020 as a merger of two student unions, Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU) and the Graduate Union (GU). CUSU previously represented all University students, and GU represented graduate students.[178][179]\n\n\nThe eight most important positions in Cambridge Students' Union are occupied by sabbatical officers.[180] In 2020, the sabbatical officers were elected with a turnout of 20.88% of the whole student body.[181]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther significant university alumni in science include Henry Cavendish, who discovered hydrogen; Frank Whittle, co-inventor of the jet engine; William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), who formulated the original Laws of Thermodynamics; William Fox Talbot, who invented the camera, Alfred North Whitehead, Einstein's major opponent; Jagadish Chandra Bose, one of the fathers of radio science; Lord Rayleigh, who made extensive contributions to both theoretical and experimental physics in the 20th century; and Georges Lemaître, who first proposed the Big Bang theory.\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge has a strong reputation in the field of politics, having educated:[188]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** Vitullo-Martin, J.

Teaching, and the fees it earned, nearly came to a halt during World War I, and severe financial difficulties followed. As a result, the university received its first systematic state support in 1919, and a Royal commission was appointed in 1920 to recommend that the university (but not its colleges) begin receiving an annual grant.[33] Following World War II, the university experienced a rapid expansion in applications and enrollment, partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.[34] This was not without controversies, however. For example, Cambridge researchers were accused in 2023 of helping to develop weapon systems for Iran.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Parliamentary representation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter presentation, the graduate is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor, who clasps them and then confers the degree through the following Latin statement, known as the Trinitarian formula (*in nomine Patris*), which may be omitted at the request of the graduand:\n\n\n\"*Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum \\_\\_\\_\\_, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti*, which translates in English as: \"By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of \\_\\_\\_\\_, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\"\n\n\nThe new graduate then rises, bows, and leaves the Senate House through the Doctor's door in Senate House Passage, where they receive their degree certificate.[148]\n\n\nFor the Cambridge Master of Arts, the degree is not awarded by merit of study, but by right following six years and one term after matriculation.\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Libraries of the University of Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCompulsory pooling criteria for post-qualified candidates\n| Qualification Type\n | Minimum grades\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A-Levels | A\\*A\\*A\\*\n | For science applicants, at least three A\\*s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| International Baccalaureate | 43 points overall with 776 at higher level or\n42 points overall with 777 at higher level\n | For science applicants, at least two 7s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| Scottish Advanced Highers | A1A1A1\n | For science applicants, at least 3 A1s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Cambridge Sports Centre opened in August 2013.

In *The Reeve's Tale*, the two main fictional characters are students at a University of Cambridge college called Soler Halle, which is believed to refer to King's Hall and is now part of Trinity College.[192]\n\n\nThe university has been the setting for all or parts of numerous novels, including Douglas Adams' *Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency*, Rose Macaulay's *They Were Defeated*,[193] and Tom Sharpe's *Porterhouse Blue*.[194]\n\n\nOther notable examples of the University of Cambridge in popular culture include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEnough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university's formation.[16][17][18]\n\n\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set *secundum consuetudinem universitatis*, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNotable University of Cambridge buildings include King's College Chapel,[54] the history faculty building[55] designed by James Stirling, and the Cripps Building at St John's College.[56] The brickwork of several colleges is notable: Queens' College has some of the earliest patterned brickwork in England[57] and the brick walls of St John's College are examples of English bond, Flemish bond, and Running bond.[58]\n\n\n\n### Sites[edit]\n\n\nThe university is divided into several sites, which house the university's various departments, including:[59]\n\n\n\n* Addenbrooke's Hospital\n* Downing Site\n* Madingley/Gorton\n* New Museums Site\n* North West Cambridge Development\n* Old Addenbrooke's Site\n* Old Schools\n* Silver Street/Mill Lane\n* Sidgwick Site\n* West Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCosts to students for room and board vary considerably from college to college.[70][71] Similarly, the investment in student education by each college at the university varies widely between the colleges.[72]\n\n\nThree theological colleges at the university, Westcott House, Westminster College, and Ridley Hall Theological College, are members of the Cambridge Theological Federation and associated in partnership with university.[73]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's 31 colleges are:[74]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHughes Hall and Fenner's\n* ![Bredon House at Wolfson College](image)\n\nBredon House at Wolfson College\n* ![St Edmund's College](image)\n\nSt Edmund's College\n* ![West Lodge Garden at Downing College](image)\n\nWest Lodge Garden at Downing College\n* ![Old Gatehouse at Queen's College](image)\n\nOld Gatehouse at Queen's College\n* ![Dining Hall at Magdalene College](image)\n\nDining Hall at Magdalene College\n* ![Chapel Court at Jesus College](image)\n\nChapel Court at Jesus College\n* ![Second Court at St John's College](image)\n\nSecond Court at St John's College\n* ![Trinity Hall](image)\n\nTrinity Hall\n* ![The Cavendish Building at Homerton College](image)\n\nThe Cavendish Building at Homerton College\n* ![Darwin College](image)\n\nDarwin College\n* ![The chapel at Sidney Sussex College](image)\n\nThe chapel at Sidney Sussex College\n* ![The interior of Judge Business School](image)\n\nThe interior of Judge Business School\n* ![The Grove at Fitzwilliam College](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_LmUPGuCKXX7D9U344FigYYjh","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][11][12] It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[13] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university was one of the first in the UK to raise money through a major public fundraising campaign, the Campaign for Oxford. The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled \"Oxford Thinking – The Campaign for the University of Oxford\".[97] This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure;[98] having passed its original target of £1.25 billion in March 2012, the target was raised to £3 billion.[99] The campaign had raised a total of £2.8 billion by July 2018.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Funding criticisms[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFour Oxford mathematicians, Michael Atiyah, Daniel Quillen, Simon Donaldson and James Maynard, have won Fields Medals, often called the \"Nobel Prize for mathematics\". Andrew Wiles, who proved Fermat's Last Theorem, was educated at Oxford and is currently the Regius Professor and Royal Society Research Professor in Mathematics at Oxford.[246] Marcus du Sautoy and Roger Penrose are both currently mathematics professors, and Jackie Stedall was a professor of the university. Stephen Wolfram, chief designer of Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha studied at the university, along with Tim Berners-Lee,[17] inventor of the World Wide Web,[247] Edgar F. Codd, inventor of the relational model of data,[248] and Tony Hoare, programming languages pioneer and inventor of Quicksort.\n\n\nThe university is associated with eleven winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, six in physics and sixteen in medicine.[249]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThese teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities,[146] and their total duration amounts to less than half the year.

Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[48][49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* List by date of foundation (Ancient; Third-oldest in England; Redbrick; Plate glass; Post-1992)\n* List by endowment\n* List by enrolment\n* Colleges within universities\n* Degree abbreviations\n* HEFCW\n* Office for Students (HEFCE)\n* Rankings\n* Scottish Funding Council\n* Student loans and grants in the United Kingdom\n* Student Radio Association\n* Student television in the United Kingdom\n* Student unionism in the United Kingdom\n* Tuition fees in the United Kingdom\n* Undergraduate degree classification\n* UCAS\n* University and College Union\n* Polytechnic\\_(United\\_Kingdom)\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) List\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![inline](image) - College (illustrative)\n | ![inline](image) - Permanent Private Hall\n |\n\n |\n\n\n\n### Main sites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Atrium of the Chemistry Research Laboratory; the university has invested heavily in new facilities at the laboratory in recent years.\n![](image)Sheldonian Theatre, built by Christopher Wren between 1664 and 1668, hosts the university's Congregation and its concerts and degree ceremonies.\nThe university is a \"city university\" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre.

The sprayed student stays in the academic dress worn to the exam. The custom began in the 1970s when friends of students taking their finals waited outside Oxford's Examination Schools where exams for most degrees are taken.[200]\n\n\nOther traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally, or even not at all. \n\n\n*Balls* are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in ninth week of Trinity Term, are called commemoration balls; the dress code is usually white tie.

Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars).

It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Oxford University Student Union, formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU,[207] exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Oxford Movement (1833–1846) was closely associated with the Oriel fellows John Henry Newman, Edward Bouverie Pusey and John Keble. Other religious figures were Mirza Nasir Ahmad, the third Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Shoghi Effendi, one of the appointed leaders of the Baháʼí Faith, and Joseph Cordeiro, the first Pakistani Catholic cardinal.[282]\n\n\n\n### Philosophy[edit]\n\n\nPhilosophers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nJohn Locke, Christ Church\n![](image)\nMary Midgley, Somerville College\n![](image)\nThomas Hobbes, Hertford College\n\nOxford's philosophical tradition started in the medieval era, with Robert Grosseteste[283] and William of Ockham,[283] commonly known for Occam's razor, among those teaching at the university. Thomas Hobbes,[284][285] Jeremy Bentham and the empiricist John Locke received degrees from Oxford.

A referendum held among the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations – 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum.[197] This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote not so much on making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, on abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.[198] In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.[199]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* All Souls College\n* Balliol College\n* Brasenose College\n* Christ Church\n* Corpus Christi College\n* Exeter College\n* Green Templeton College\n* Harris Manchester College\n* Hertford College\n* Jesus College\n* Keble College\n* Kellogg College\n* Lady Margaret Hall\n* Linacre College\n* Lincoln College\n* Magdalen College\n* Mansfield College\n* Merton College\n* New College\n* Nuffield College\n* Oriel College\n* Pembroke College\n* The Queen's College\n* Reuben College\n* St Anne's College\n* St Antony's College\n* St Catherine's College\n* St Cross College\n* St Edmund Hall\n* St Hilda's College\n* St Hugh's College\n* St John's College\n* St Peter's College\n* Somerville College\n* Trinity College\n* University College\n* Wadham College\n* Wolfson College\n* Worcester College\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the start of 1914, the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students.

By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total.[46] The University Roll of Service records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed.[47] Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, 'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914–1918'.

There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][11][12] It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[13] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university was one of the first in the UK to raise money through a major public fundraising campaign, the Campaign for Oxford. The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled \"Oxford Thinking – The Campaign for the University of Oxford\".[97] This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure;[98] having passed its original target of £1.25 billion in March 2012, the target was raised to £3 billion.[99] The campaign had raised a total of £2.8 billion by July 2018.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Funding criticisms[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFour Oxford mathematicians, Michael Atiyah, Daniel Quillen, Simon Donaldson and James Maynard, have won Fields Medals, often called the \"Nobel Prize for mathematics\". Andrew Wiles, who proved Fermat's Last Theorem, was educated at Oxford and is currently the Regius Professor and Royal Society Research Professor in Mathematics at Oxford.[246] Marcus du Sautoy and Roger Penrose are both currently mathematics professors, and Jackie Stedall was a professor of the university. Stephen Wolfram, chief designer of Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha studied at the university, along with Tim Berners-Lee,[17] inventor of the World Wide Web,[247] Edgar F. Codd, inventor of the relational model of data,[248] and Tony Hoare, programming languages pioneer and inventor of Quicksort.\n\n\nThe university is associated with eleven winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, six in physics and sixteen in medicine.[249]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThese teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities,[146] and their total duration amounts to less than half the year.

From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%.[138] Oxford University spends over £6 million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.[134]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Humanities | * Asian and Middle Eastern Studies\n* American Institute\n* Art\n* Classics\n* History\n* Linguistics, Philology & Phonetics\n* Medieval and Modern Languages\n* Music\n* Philosophy\n* Theology and Religion\n |\n| Medical Sciences | * Biochemistry\n* Human Genetics\n* Medical School\n* Pathology\n* Population Health\n |\n| Mathematical, Physicaland Life Sciences | * Biology\n* Chemistry\n* Computer Science\n* Earth Sciences\n* Engineering Science\n* Materials\n* Mathematical Institute\n* Physics\n |\n| Social Sciences | * Archaeology\n* Business\n* Continuing Education\n* Economics\n* Government\n* International Development\n* Law\n* Politics & International Relations\n* Social Policy and Intervention\n |\n| Gardens, Libraries& Museums | * Ashmolean Museum\n* Bodleian Libraries\n* Botanic Garden\n* History of Science\n* Natural History\n* Pitt Rivers\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Tom Quad, Christ Church\n![](image)Main Quad, Worcester College\nTo be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall.

Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[48][49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* List by date of foundation (Ancient; Third-oldest in England; Redbrick; Plate glass; Post-1992)\n* List by endowment\n* List by enrolment\n* Colleges within universities\n* Degree abbreviations\n* HEFCW\n* Office for Students (HEFCE)\n* Rankings\n* Scottish Funding Council\n* Student loans and grants in the United Kingdom\n* Student Radio Association\n* Student television in the United Kingdom\n* Student unionism in the United Kingdom\n* Tuition fees in the United Kingdom\n* Undergraduate degree classification\n* UCAS\n* University and College Union\n* Polytechnic\\_(United\\_Kingdom)\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) List\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![inline](image) - College (illustrative)\n | ![inline](image) - Permanent Private Hall\n |\n\n |\n\n\n\n### Main sites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Atrium of the Chemistry Research Laboratory; the university has invested heavily in new facilities at the laboratory in recent years.\n![](image)Sheldonian Theatre, built by Christopher Wren between 1664 and 1668, hosts the university's Congregation and its concerts and degree ceremonies.\nThe university is a \"city university\" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre.

Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Oxford Movement (1833–1846) was closely associated with the Oriel fellows John Henry Newman, Edward Bouverie Pusey and John Keble. Other religious figures were Mirza Nasir Ahmad, the third Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Shoghi Effendi, one of the appointed leaders of the Baháʼí Faith, and Joseph Cordeiro, the first Pakistani Catholic cardinal.[282]\n\n\n\n### Philosophy[edit]\n\n\nPhilosophers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nJohn Locke, Christ Church\n![](image)\nMary Midgley, Somerville College\n![](image)\nThomas Hobbes, Hertford College\n\nOxford's philosophical tradition started in the medieval era, with Robert Grosseteste[283] and William of Ockham,[283] commonly known for Occam's razor, among those teaching at the university. Thomas Hobbes,[284][285] Jeremy Bentham and the empiricist John Locke received degrees from Oxford. Though the latter's main works were written after leaving Oxford, Locke was heavily influenced by his twelve years at the university.[283]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)An undergraduate student at the University of Oxford in subfusc for matriculation\nAcademic dress is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held among the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations – 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum.[197] This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote not so much on making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, on abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.[198] In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.[199]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* All Souls College\n* Balliol College\n* Brasenose College\n* Christ Church\n* Corpus Christi College\n* Exeter College\n* Green Templeton College\n* Harris Manchester College\n* Hertford College\n* Jesus College\n* Keble College\n* Kellogg College\n* Lady Margaret Hall\n* Linacre College\n* Lincoln College\n* Magdalen College\n* Mansfield College\n* Merton College\n* New College\n* Nuffield College\n* Oriel College\n* Pembroke College\n* The Queen's College\n* Reuben College\n* St Anne's College\n* St Antony's College\n* St Catherine's College\n* St Cross College\n* St Edmund Hall\n* St Hilda's College\n* St Hugh's College\n* St John's College\n* St Peter's College\n* Somerville College\n* Trinity College\n* University College\n* Wadham College\n* Wolfson College\n* Worcester College\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the start of 1914, the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War, many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total.[46] The University Roll of Service records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed.[47] Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, 'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914–1918'.

This swift rise to performance [was] understood at the time as related directly to the university's defense contracts...\"[74] Stanford was once considered a school for \"the wealthy\",[75] but controversies in later decades damaged its reputation. The 1971 Stanford prison experiment was criticized as unethical,[76] and the misuse of government funds from 1981 resulted in severe penalties for the school's research funding[77][78] and the resignation of Stanford President Donald Kennedy in 1992.[79]\n\n\n\n## Land[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n55. **^** Edith R., Mirrielees (1959). *Stanford: The Story of a University*.

As of 2012, Lake Lagunita was often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it.[85] Heavy rains in January 2023 refilled Lake Lagunita (colloquially known as Lake Lag) to up to 8 feet of depth.[86] Two other reservoirs, Searsville Lake on San Francisquito Creek and Felt Lake,[87] are on more remote sections of the founding grant.\n\n\n\n### Central campus[edit]\n\n\nThe central academic campus is adjacent to Palo Alto,[88] bounded by El Camino Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Blvd, and Sand Hill Road.

The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Jane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great Eastern universities, specifically Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Stanford was referred to as the \"Cornell of the West\" in 1891 due to a majority of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates, including its first president, David Starr Jordan, and second president, John Casper Branner. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to make higher education accessible, non-sectarian, and open to women as well as men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt that radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStanford is a private, non-profit university administered as a corporate trust governed by a privately appointed board of trustees with a maximum membership of 38.[112][note 3] Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet five times annually.[115] A new trustee is chosen by the current trustees by ballot.[113] The Stanford trustees also oversee the Stanford Research Park, the Stanford Shopping Center, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University Medical Center, and many associated medical facilities (including the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital).[116]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n306. **^** \"About StartX\". *StartX*.\n307. **^** \"StartX Demo Day attracts Stanford-connected start-ups, Silicon Valley investors\". *The Stanford Daily*.

Berry College with over 26,000 acres (40.6 sq mi; 105.2 km2), Paul Smith's College with 14,200 acres (22.2 sq mi; 57.5 km2), and the United States Air Force Academy with 18,500 acres (7,500 ha) are larger but are not usually classified as universities. Duke University at 8,610 acres (13.5 sq mi; 34.8 km2) does have more land, but it is not contiguous.

The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Jane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great Eastern universities, specifically Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Stanford was referred to as the \"Cornell of the West\" in 1891 due to a majority of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates, including its first president, David Starr Jordan, and second president, John Casper Branner. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to make higher education accessible, non-sectarian, and open to women as well as men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt that radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStanford is a private, non-profit university administered as a corporate trust governed by a privately appointed board of trustees with a maximum membership of 38.[112][note 3] Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet five times annually.[115] A new trustee is chosen by the current trustees by ballot.[113] The Stanford trustees also oversee the Stanford Research Park, the Stanford Shopping Center, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University Medical Center, and many associated medical facilities (including the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital).[116]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n306. **^** \"About StartX\". *StartX*.\n307. **^** \"StartX Demo Day attracts Stanford-connected start-ups, Silicon Valley investors\". *The Stanford Daily*.
