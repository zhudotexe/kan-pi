Apple's core product lines are the iPhone smartphone, iPad tablet computer, and the Macintosh personal computer. The company offers its products online and has a chain of retail stores known as Apple Stores. Founders Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne created Apple Computer Co. on April 1, 1976, to market Wozniak's Apple I desktop computer,[2] and Jobs and Wozniak incorporated the company on January 3, 1977,[3] in Cupertino, California.\n\n\nFor more than three decades, Apple Computer was predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and Power Mac lines, but it faced rocky sales and low market share during the 1990s. Jobs, who had been ousted from the company in 1985, returned to Apple in 1997 after his company NeXT was bought by Apple.[4] The following year he became the company's interim CEO,[5] which later became permanent.[6] Jobs subsequently instilled a new corporate philosophy of recognizable products and simple design, starting with the original iMac in 1998.\n\n\nWith the introduction of the successful iPod music player in 2001 and iTunes Music Store in 2003, Apple established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics and media sales industries, leading it to drop \"Computer\" from the company's name in 2007. The company is also known for its iOS range of smart phone, media player, and tablet computer products that began with the iPhone, followed by the iPod Touch and then iPad. As of June 30, 2015, Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization,[7] with an estimated value of US$1 trillion as of August 2, 2018.[8] Apple's worldwide annual revenue in 2010 totaled US$65 billion, growing to US$127.8 billion in 2011[9] and $156 billion in 2012.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## 1971–1985: Jobs and Wozniak[edit]\n\n\n### Pre-foundation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steve Wozniak's \"blue box\" at the Computer History Museum\nSteve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, referred to collectively as \"the two Steves\", first met in mid-1971, when their mutual friend Bill Fernandez introduced then 21-year-old Wozniak to 16-year-old Jobs.[11][12] Their first business partnership began in the fall of that year when Wozniak, a self-educated electronics engineer, read an article in *Esquire* magazine that described a device that could place free long-distance phone calls by emitting specific tone chirps. Wozniak started to build his original “blue boxes”, which he tested by calling the Vatican City pretending to be Henry Kissinger wanting to speak to the pope.[13] Jobs managed to sell some two hundred blue boxes for $150 each, and split the profit with Wozniak.[11][12] Jobs later told his biographer that if it hadn't been for Wozniak's blue boxes, \"there wouldn't have been an Apple.\"[14]\n\n\nBy 1972, Jobs had withdrawn from Reed College and Wozniak from UC Berkeley. Wozniak designed a video terminal that he could use to log on to the minicomputers at Call Computer. Alex Kamradt commissioned the design and sold a small number of them through his firm. Aside from their interest in up-to-date technology, the impetus for the two Steves seems to have had another source. In his essay *From Satori to Silicon Valley* (published 1986), cultural historian Theodore Roszak made the point that Apple Computer emerged from within the West Coast counterculture and the need to produce print-outs, letter labels, and databases. Roszak offers a bit of background on the development of the two Steves' prototype models.\n\n\nIn 1975, the two Steves started attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club.[15] New microcomputers such as the Altair 8800 and the IMSAI 8080 inspired Wozniak to build a microprocessor into his video terminal circuit to make a complete computer. At the time the only microcomputer CPUs generally available were the $179 Intel 8080 (equivalent to $1,014 in 2023), and the $170 Motorola 6800 (equivalent to $963 in 2023). Wozniak preferred the 6800, but both were out of his price range. So he watched, and learned, and designed computers on paper, waiting for the day he could afford a CPU.\n\n\nWhen MOS Technology released its $20 (equivalent to $107 in 2023) 6502 chip in 1976, Wozniak wrote a version of BASIC for it, then began to design a computer for it to run on. The 6502 was designed by the same people who designed the 6800, as many in Silicon Valley left employers to form their own companies. Wozniak's earlier 6800 paper-computer needed only minor changes to run on the new chip.\n\n\nBy March 1, 1976, Wozniak completed the machine and took it to a Homebrew Computer Club meeting to show it off.[16] When Jobs saw Wozniak's computer, which later became the Apple I, he was immediately interested in its commercial potential.[17] Initially, Wozniak intended to share schematics of the machine for free, but Jobs insisted that they should instead build and sell bare printed circuit boards for the computer.[18] Wozniak originally offered the design to Hewlett-Packard (HP), where he worked at the time, but was denied by the company on five occasions.[19] Jobs eventually convinced Wozniak to go into business together and start a new company of their own.[20] In order to raise the money they needed to produce the first batch of printed circuit boards, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Type 2 minibus for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak his HP-65 programmable calculator for $500.[18][16][21][22]\n\n\n\n### Apple I and company formation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steve Jobs' parents' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, where Apple started its operation.[23] Initial work took place in his bedroom and later moved to the home's garage.[15]\n![](image)Wozniak's Apple I design was sold as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case.\n![](image)\nThe first Apple logo, drawn by Ronald Wayne, depicts Isaac Newton under an apple tree.\n![](image)\nCreated by Rob Janoff in 1977, the Apple logo with the rainbow scheme was used from April of that year[24] until August 26, 1999.[*citation needed*]\n\nOn April 1, 1976, Apple Computer Company was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne.[25][20] The company was registered as a California business partnership.[26]\nWayne, who worked at Atari as a chief draftsman, became a co-founder in return for a 10% stake.[27][20][2] Wayne was gun-shy due to the failure of his own venture four years earlier. On April 12, less than two weeks after the company's formation, Wayne left Apple, selling his 10% share back to the two Steves for $800.[28][29]\n\n\nAccording to Wozniak, Jobs proposed the name “Apple Computer” when he had just come back from Robert Friedland's All-One Farm in Oregon.[29] Jobs told Walter Isaacson that he was \"on one of my fruitarian diets,\" when he conceived of the name and thought \"it sounded fun, spirited and not intimidating ... plus, it would get us ahead of Atari in the phone book.\"[30]\n\n\nThe two Steves made a last trip to the Homebrew Computer Club and demonstrated the Apple I (AKA: The Apple Computer).[31] Paul Terrell, who operated the computer store chain *Byte Shop*, was impressed,[27] and gave the two Steves his card, asking them to keep in touch.[32] The next day, Jobs visited Terrell at the Mountain View Byte Shop store, and tried to sell him the bare circuit boards for the Apple I.[29] Terrell said he was only interested in purchasing the machine fully assembled, and that he would order 50 assembled computers and pay US$500 each on delivery (equivalent to $2,700 in 2023).[33][34][27] Jobs took the purchase order from the Byte Shop to national electronic parts distributor Cramer Electronics, and ordered the components needed. When asked by the credit manager how he would pay for the parts, Jobs replied, \"I have this purchase order from the Byte Shop chain of computer stores for 50 of my computers and the payment terms are COD. If you give me the parts on net 30-day terms I can build and deliver the computers in that time frame, collect my money from Terrell at the Byte Shop and pay you.\"[35][36]\n\n\nTo verify the purchase order, the credit manager called Paul Terrell, who assured him if the computers showed up, Jobs would have more than enough money for the parts order. The two Steves and their small crew spent day and night building and testing the computers, and delivered to Terrell on time. Terrell was surprised to receive a batch of assembled circuit boards, as he had expected complete computers with a case, monitor and keyboard.[37][38] Nonetheless, he kept his word and paid the two Steves the money promised.[39][37][38][40]\n\n\nThe Apple I went on sale in July 1976 as an assembled circuit board with a retail price of $666.66.[41][42][43] Wozniak later said he had had no idea about the relation between the number and the mark of the beast, and that he came up with the price because he liked repeating digits.[39] About 200 units of the Apple I were eventually sold.[44]\n\n\nThe Apple I computer had some notable features, including the use of a TV display, whereas many machines had no display at all. This was not like the displays of later machines; the text was displayed at 60 characters per second – still faster than the teleprinters of contemporary machines of that era. The machine had bootstrap code on ROM, making it easier to start up. At the insistence of Paul Terrell, Wozniak designed a cassette interface for loading and saving programs, at the then-rapid pace of 1200 bit/s. The simple machine was a masterpiece of design using far fewer parts than anything in its class, and earned Wozniak his reputation as a designer.\n\n\nJobs looked for investments to expand the business,[38] but banks were reluctant to lend him money; the idea of a computer for ordinary people seemed absurd at the time. In August 1976, Jobs approached his former boss at Atari, Nolan Bushnell, who recommended that he meet with Don Valentine, the founder of Sequoia Capital.[38] Valentine was not interested in funding Apple, but in turn introduced Jobs to Mike Markkula, a millionaire who had worked under him at Fairchild Semiconductor.[38] Markkula saw great potential in the two Steves, and became an angel investor of their company.[45] He invested $92,000 in Apple out of his own property while securing a $250,000 (equivalent to $1,340,000 in 2023) line of credit from Bank of America.[45][38] In return, Markkula received a one-third stake in Apple.[45] Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977.[38] The new corporation bought out the partnership the two Steves had formed nine months earlier.[46]\n\n\nIn February 1977, Markkula recruited Michael Scott from National Semiconductor to serve as the first president and CEO of Apple Computer, as the two Steves were both insufficiently experienced and he was not interested in taking that position himself.[47][48]\nThat same month, Wozniak resigned from his job at Hewlett-Packard to work full-time for Apple.[46][49]\n\n\n\n### Apple II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple II series\n\n![](image)\nApple II Plus, designed primarily by Wozniak\n![](image)\nDisk II, also designed by Wozniak\n\nAlmost as soon as Apple had started selling its first computers, Wozniak moved on from the Apple I and began designing a greatly improved computer: the Apple II.[45] Wozniak completed a working prototype of the new machine by August 1976.[38][50] The two Steves presented the Apple II computer to the public at the first West Coast Computer Faire on April 16 and 17, 1977. On the first day of the exhibition, Jobs introduced the Apple II to a Japanese chemist named Toshio Mizushima, who became the first authorized Apple dealer in Japan. In the May 1977 issue of *Byte*, Wozniak said of the Apple II design, \"To me, a personal computer should be small, reliable, convenient to use, and inexpensive.\"[51]\n\n\nThe Apple II went on sale on June 10, 1977, with a retail price of $1,298.[52] The computer's main internal difference from its predecessor was a completely redesigned TV interface, which held the display in memory. Now not only useful for simple text display, the Apple II included graphics and, eventually, color. During the development of the Apple II, Jobs pressed for a well-designed plastic case and built-in keyboard, with the idea that the machine should be fully packaged and ready to run out of the box.[53] This was almost the case for the Apple I computers, but one still needed to plug various parts together and type in the code to run BASIC. Jobs wanted the Apple II case to be \"simple and elegant\", and hired an industrial designer named Jerry Manock to produce such a case design.[53] Apple employee #5 Rod Holt developed the switching power supply.[54]\n\n\nWhile early Apple II models use ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded in 1978 by the introduction of a 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II.[55][56] The Disk II system was designed by Wozniak and released with a retail price of $495.[55]\n\n\nIn 1979, the Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first \"killer application\" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet.[55] So important that the Apple II became what John Markoff described as a \"VisiCalc accessory\",[57] the application created a business market for the computer and gave home users an additional reason to buy it: compatibility with the office.[55] Before VisiCalc, Apple had been a distant third place competitor to Commodore and Tandy.[58][59]\n\n\nThe Apple II was one of the three \"1977 Trinity\" computers generally credited with creating the home computer market (the other two being the Commodore PET and the Tandy Corporation TRS-80).[60] A number of different models of the Apple II were built thereafter, including the Apple IIe and Apple IIGS,[61] which continued in public use for nearly two decades. The Apple II series went on to sell about six million units in total before it was discontinued in 1993.[62][63]\n\n\n\n### Apple III[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple III\n\n![](image)Apple III with Apple Monitor III\nWhile the Apple II was already established as a successful business-ready platform because of VisiCalc, Apple management was not content. The Apple III was designed to take on the business environment in an attempt to compete with IBM in the business and corporate computing market.[64] The development of the Apple III started in late 1978 under the guidance of Wendell Sander,[65] and was subsequently developed by a committee headed by Jobs.[66] The Apple III was first announced on May 19, 1980, with a retail price ranging from $4,340\nto $7,800, and released in November 1980.[66]\n\n\nThe Apple III was a conservative design for the era, however Jobs wanted the heat generated by the electronics to be dissipated through the chassis of the machine rather than by the more usual cooling fan. The case was not sufficient to cool the components and the Apple III was prone to overheating, causing the integrated circuit chips to disconnect from the motherboard. Customers who contacted Apple customer service were told to \"raise the computers six inches in the air, and then let go\", which would cause the integrated circuits to fall back into place.\n\n\nThousands of Apple III computers were recalled. A new model was introduced in 1983 to try to rectify the problems, but the damage was already done.\n\n\n\n### Apple IPO[edit]\n\n\nIn the July 1980 issue of *Kilobaud Microcomputing*, publisher Wayne Green stated that \"the best consumer ads I've seen have been those by Apple. They are attention-getting, and they must be prompting sale.\"[67] In August, the *Financial Times* reported that\n\n\n\n\n> Apple Computer, the fast growing Californian manufacturer of small computers for the consumer, business and educational markets, is planning to go public later this year. [It] is the largest private manufacturer in the U.S. of small computers. Founded about five years ago as a small workshop business, it has become the second largest manufacturer of small computers, after the Radio Shack division of the Tandy company.[68]\n> \n> \n\n\nOn December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol \"AAPL\") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of November 30, 2020[update]),[69] generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[70] Several venture capitalists cashed out, reaping billions in long-term capital gains. By the end of the day, the stock rose to $29 per share and 300 millionaires were created, including the two Steves.[71][72] Around this time Wozniak offered $10 million of his own stock to early Apple employees, something Jobs refused to do.[71] Apple's market cap was $1.778 billion at the end of its first day of trading.[70][72]\n\n\nIn January 1981, Apple held its first shareholders meeting as a public company in the Flint Center, a large auditorium at nearby De Anza College (which is often used for symphony concerts) to handle the larger numbers of shareholders post-IPO. The business of the meeting had been planned so that the voting could be staged in 15 minutes or less. In most cases, voting proxies are collected by mail and counted days or months before a meeting. In this case, after the IPO, many shares were in new hands.\n\n\nJobs started his prepared speech, but after being interrupted by voting several times, he dropped his prepared speech and delivered a long, emotionally charged talk about betrayal, lack of respect, and related topics.[73]\n\n\n\n### Competition from the IBM PC[edit]\n\n\nBy August 1981 Apple was among the three largest microcomputer companies, perhaps having replaced Radio Shack as the leader;[74] revenue in the first half of the year had already exceeded 1980's $118 million, and *InfoWorld* reported that lack of production capacity was constraining growth.[75] Because of VisiCalc businesses purchased 90% of Apple II computers;[76][77] large customers especially preferred Apple.[78]\n\n\nIBM entered the personal computer market that month with the IBM PC[79][80] in part because it did not want products without IBM logos on customers' desks,[81] but Apple had many advantages. While IBM began with one microcomputer, little available hardware or software, and a couple of hundred dealers, Apple had five times as many dealers in the US and an established international distribution network. The Apple II had an installed base of more than 250,000 customers, and hundreds of independent developers offered software and peripherals; at least ten databases and ten word processors were available, while the PC had no databases and one word processor.[82]\n\n\nThe company's customers gained a reputation for devotion and loyalty. *BYTE* in 1984 stated that[83]\n\n\n\n\n> There are two kinds of people in the world: people who say Apple isn't just a company, it's a cause; and people who say Apple isn't a cause, it's just a company. Both groups are right. Nature has suspended the principle of noncontradiction where Apple is concerned.\n> Apple is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth ... Apple is two guys in a garage undertaking the mission of bringing computing power, once reserved for big corporations, to ordinary individuals with ordinary budgets. The company's growth from two guys to a billion-dollar corporation exemplifies the American Dream. Even as a large corporation, Apple plays David to IBM's Goliath, and thus has the sympathetic role in that myth.\n> \n> \n\n\nThe magazine noted that the loyalty was not entirely positive for Apple; customers were willing to overlook real flaws in its products, even while holding the company to a higher standard than for competitors.[83] The Apple III was an example of its autocratic reputation among dealers[78] that one described as \"Apple arrogance\".[84] After examining a PC and finding it unimpressive, Apple confidently purchased a full-page advertisement in *The Wall Street Journal* with the headline \"Welcome, IBM. Seriously\".[85][80] The company prioritized the III for three years, spending what Wozniak estimated as $100 million on marketing and R&D while not improving the Apple II to compete with the PC, as doing so could hurt III sales.[77]\n\n\nMicrosoft head Bill Gates was at Apple headquarters the day of IBM's announcement and later said \"They didn't seem to care. It took them a full year to realize what had happened\".[80] The PC almost completely ended sales of the III, the company's most comparable product. The II still sold well,[81] with Apple being the leading computer manufacturer in the United States where 7 million units were sold between 1978 and 1982.[86] But by 1983, the PC surpassed the Apple II as the best-selling personal computer.[87] IBM recruited the best Apple dealers while avoiding the discount grey market they disliked.[81] The head of a retail chain said \"It appears that IBM had a better understanding of why the Apple II was successful than had Apple\".[78] Gene Amdahl predicted that Apple would be another of the many \"brash young companies\" that IBM had defeated.[88]\n\n\nBy 1984 the press called the two companies archrivals,[89] but IBM had $4 billion in annual PC revenue, more than twice that of Apple and as much as the sales of it and the next three companies combined.[90] A *Fortune* survey found that 56% of American companies with personal computers used IBM PCs, compared to 16% for Apple.[91] Small businesses, schools, and some homes became the II's primary market.[76]\n\n\n\n### Xerox PARC and the Lisa[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Lisa\n\n![](image)Apple Lisa\nApple Computer's business division was focused on the Apple III, another iteration of the text-based computer. Simultaneously the Lisa group worked on a new machine that would feature a completely different interface and introduce the words *mouse*, *icon*, and *desktop* into the lexicon of the computing public. In return for the right to buy US$1,000,000 of pre-IPO stock, Xerox granted Apple Computer three days access to the PARC facilities. After visiting PARC, they came away with new ideas that would complete the foundation for Apple Computer's first GUI computer, the Apple Lisa.[92][93][94][95]\n\n\nThe first iteration of Apple's WIMP interface was a floppy disk where files could be spatially moved around. After months of usability testing, Apple designed the Lisa interface of windows and icons.\n\n\nThe Lisa was introduced in 1983 at a cost of US$9,995 (equivalent to $30,600 in 2023). Because of the high price, Lisa failed to penetrate the business market.\n\n\n\n### Macintosh and the \"1984\" commercial[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the Macintosh and 1984 (advertisement)\n\n![](image)Macintosh 128K\nBy 1984 computer dealers saw Apple as the only clear alternative to IBM's influence;[96] some even promoted its products to reduce dependence on the PC.[81] The company announced the Macintosh 128K to the press in October 1983, followed by an 18-page brochure included with magazines in December.[97] Its debut was announced by a single national broadcast of a US$1.5 million television commercial, \"1984\" (equivalent to $4,400,000 in 2023). Directed by Ridley Scott and aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984,[98] it is considered a \"watershed event\"[99] and a \"masterpiece.\"[100] The commercial alludes to George Orwell's novel *Nineteen Eighty-Four* which describes a dystopian future of enforced conformity. In the commercial a heroine represents the coming of the Macintosh to save humanity,[101] and ends with the words: \"On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984.”[102]\n\n\nOn January 24, 1984, the Macintosh went on sale with a retail price of $2,495.[103][104] It came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface: MacWrite and MacPaint. On the same day, an emotional Jobs introduced the computer to a wildly enthusiastic audience at Apple's annual shareholders meeting held in the Flint Auditorium;[105][106] Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld described the scene as \"pandemonium\".[107] Jobs had directed the development of the Macintosh since 1981, when he took over the project from early Apple employee Jef Raskin, who conceived the computer,[108][109] and Wozniak, who led the initial design and development with Raskin but was on leave during this time due to an airplane crash earlier that year, making it easier for Jobs to take over the program.[110][111] The Macintosh was based on The Lisa (and Xerox PARC's mouse-driven graphical user interface),[112][113] and it was widely acclaimed by the media with strong initial sales supporting it.[114][115] However, the slow processing speed and limited software led to a rapid sales decline in the second half of 1984.[114][115][116]\n\n\nThe Macintosh was too radical for some, who labeled it a mere \"toy\". Because the machine was entirely designed around the GUI, existing text-mode and command-driven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten; this was a challenging undertaking that many software developers shied away from, and resulted in an initial lack of software for the new system. In April 1984 Microsoft's Multiplan migrated over from MS-DOS, followed by Microsoft Word in January 1985.[117] In 1985, Lotus Software introduced Lotus Jazz after the success of Lotus 1-2-3 for the IBM PC, although it was largely a flop.[118] Apple introduced Macintosh Office the same year with the lemmings ad, infamous for insulting potential customers. It was not successful.[119]\n\n\nFor a special post-election edition of *Newsweek* in November 1984, Apple spent more than US$2.5 million to buy all 39 of the advertising pages in the issue.[120] Apple also ran a \"Test Drive a Macintosh\" promotion, in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards. While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad shape that they could no longer be sold. This marketing campaign caused CEO John Sculley to raise the price from US$1,995 (equivalent to $5,900 in 2023) to US$2,495 (equivalent to $7,300 in 2023).[119] The Macintosh spawned the concept of Mac evangelism, which was pioneered by Apple employee, and later Apple Fellow, Guy Kawasaki.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Jobs and Wozniak leave Apple[edit]\n\n\nBy early 1985, the Macintosh's failure to defeat the IBM PC[114][115] triggered a power struggle between Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired two years earlier by Jobs[121][122] using the famous line, \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\"[123] Sculley and Jobs' visions for the company greatly differed. The former favored open architecture computers like the Apple II, sold to education, small business, and home markets less vulnerable to IBM. Jobs wanted the company to focus on the closed architecture Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC. President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the Board Jobs' Macintosh division; it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies, duplicating services.[124] Although its products provided 85% of Apple's sales in early 1985, the company's January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or employees. This frustrated Wozniak, who left active employment at Apple in the spring of that year to pursue other ventures, stating that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\" and sold most of his stock.[125][126][127] Despite these grievances, Wozniak left the company amicably and as of January 2018 continues to represent Apple at events or in interviews,[126] receiving a stipend over the years for this role estimated in 2006 to be $120,000 per year.[128] Wozniak also remained an Apple shareholder following his departure.[129]\n\n\nWozniak's first venture after leaving Apple was founding CL 9 in 1985 and creating the first programmable universal remote control two years later, called the \"CORE\", stating that \"I never felt like I was turning my back on my own company [Apple].\" He told Apple's director of engineering Wayne Rosing about his decision to step away from the company, but not his longtime business partner and friend Steve Jobs. Wozniak guessed that Jobs first heard the news from an article in *The Wall Street Journal* where he mentioned that he wasn't leaving because he was disgruntled with Apple, but that he was excited to build a new remote control. The article nevertheless included some of Wozniak's criticisms of Apple, and Wozniak later said \"it was an accident, but it's been picked up by every book and every bit of history [since].\"[128]: 289\n\n\nIn April 1985, Sculley decided to remove Jobs as the general manager of the Macintosh division, and gained unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[130][121] Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple.[131] Informed by Jean-Louis Gassée, Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called an emergency executive meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.[131]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pixar headquarters in Emeryville, California\nJobs, while taking the position of Chairman of the firm, had no influence over Apple's direction and resigned in September 1985, taking a number of Apple employees with him to found NeXT Inc.[132] In a show of defiance at being set aside by Apple Computer, Jobs sold all but one of his 6.5 million shares in the company for $70 million. Jobs then acquired the visual effects house, Pixar for $5M (equivalent to $13,900,000 in 2023). NeXT Inc. built computers with futuristic designs and the UNIX-derived NEXTSTEP operating system. NeXTSTEP eventually developed into Mac OS X. While not a commercial success, due in part to its high price, the NeXT computer introduced important concepts to the history of the personal computer, including serving as the initial platform for Tim Berners-Lee as he was developing the World Wide Web.[133]\n\n\nSculley reorganized the company, unifying sales and marketing in one division and product operations and development in another.[134][124] Despite initial marketing difficulties, the Macintosh brand was eventually a success for Apple, due to its introduction of desktop publishing (and later computer animation) through Apple's partnership with Adobe Systems, which introduced the laser printer and Adobe PageMaker. The Macintosh became the default platform for many arts industries including cinema, music, advertising, and publishing.\n\n\n\n## 1985–1997: Sculley, Spindler, Amelio[edit]\n\n\n### Corporate performance[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple\n\n![](image)Macintosh SE (1987)\nUnder leadership of John Sculley, Apple issued its first corporate stock dividend on May 11, 1987. A month later on June 16, Apple stock split for the first time in a 2:1 split. Apple kept a quarterly dividend with about 0.3% yield until November 21, 1995.[*citation needed*] Between March 1988 and January 1989, Apple undertook five acquisitions, including software companies Network Innovations,[135] Styleware,[136] Nashoba Systems,[137] and Coral Software,[138] as well as satellite communications company Orion Network Systems.[139]\n\n\nApple continued to sell both lines of its computers, the Apple II and the Macintosh. A few months after introducing the Mac, Apple released a compact version of the Apple II called the Apple IIc. And in 1986 Apple introduced the Apple IIGS, an Apple II positioned as something of a hybrid product with a mouse-driven, Mac-like operating environment. Even with the release of the first Macintosh, Apple II computers remained the main source of income for Apple for years.[140]\n\n\n\n### The Mac family[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Macintosh models\n\n![](image)PowerBook 100 (1991)\nAt the same time, the Mac was becoming a product family of its own. The original model evolved into the Mac Plus in 1986 and spawned the Mac SE and the Mac II in 1987 and the Mac Classic and Mac LC in 1990. Meanwhile, Apple attempted its first portable Macs: the failed Macintosh Portable in 1989 and then the more popular PowerBook in 1991, a landmark product that established the modern form and ergonomic layout of the laptop. Popular products and increasing revenues made this a good time for Apple. MacAddict magazine has called 1989 to 1991 the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh.\n\n\nOn February 19, 1987, Apple registered the \"Apple.com\" domain name, making it one of the first hundred companies to register a .com address on the nascent Internet.[141]\n\n\n\n### Early-mid-1990s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Apple Newton MessagePad (1993)\nIn the late 1980s, Apple's fiercest technological rivals were the Amiga and Atari ST platforms. But computers based on the IBM PC were far more popular than all three, and by the 1990s, they finally had a comparable GUI thanks to Windows 3.0, and were out-competing Apple.\n\n\nApple's response to the PC threat was a profusion of new Macintosh lines including Quadra, Centris, and Performa. These new lines were marketed poorly by what was now \"arguably one of the worst-managed companies in the industry\".[142] There were too many models, differentiated by very minor graduations in technical specifications. The profusion of arbitrary model numbers confused consumers and hurt Apple's reputation for simplicity. Resellers like Sears and CompUSA often failed to sell or even competently display these Macs. Inventory grew as Apple consistently underestimated demand for popular models and overestimated demand for others.[142]\n\n\nIn 1991, Apple partnered with long-time competitor IBM and Motorola to form the AIM alliance, with the ultimate goal to create a revolutionary new computing platform, known as PReP, using IBM and Motorola hardware and Apple software. As the first step, Apple started the Power Macintosh line in 1994, using PowerPC processors from Motorola and IBM. The RISC architecture of these processors differed substantially from the Motorola 680X0 series used by previous Macs. Parts of Apple's operating system were rewritten to allow some older Mac software to run in emulation on the PowerPC series.[*citation needed*] Apple refused IBM's offer to purchase the company, but later unsuccessfully sought another offer from IBM,[143] and at one point was \"hours away\" from an acquisition by Sun Microsystems.[142][144]\n\n\nIn 1993, Apple released the Newton, an early personal digital assistant (PDA).\n\n\n\n### Need for a new OS[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

It was shut down in 1996.\n\n\nIn 1995, to achieve deeper market penetration and extra revenue, Apple officially began licensing the Mac OS and Macintosh ROMs to 3rd party manufacturers. The \"Clonintoshes\" competed with Apple's own Mac's and reduced Apple's sales. Apple had market share of over 10% until Jobs was re-hired in 1997 as interim CEO to replace Gil Amelio, and found a loophole to terminate the Macintosh OS licensing program. Macintosh's market share fell to around 3%.\n\n\nDuring the 90's, \"project *Pink*\" had Apple and IBM collaborating to develop a new operating system, named *Taligent* to replace *System 7*. Infighting resulted in Apple leaving the project and IBM finishing it. Apple started project *Copland*, but it was affected by Feature creep then Development hell due to software planned for Taligent being reworked for Copland. Ultimately Copland was scrapped.\n\n\nWith the Copland project in disarray, Apple decided it needed to acquire another company's operating system. Candidates considered were Sun's Solaris and Windows NT. Hancock was in favor of Solaris, while Amelio preferred Windows. Amelio called Bill Gates, and Gates promised Microsoft engineers would port QuickDraw to NT.[145]\n\n\n\n### Acquisition of NeXT[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

On December 20, 1996, Apple announced it would purchase NeXT, and its NeXTstep operating system, for $429 million and 1.5 million shares of Apple stock. This brought Jobs back to Apple's management for the first time since 1985, and NeXT technology became the foundation of the Mac OS X operating system.\n\n\n## 1997–2001: Apple's comeback[edit]\n\n\n### Return of Steve Jobs[edit]\n\n\nOn July 9, 1997, Gil Amelio was ousted as CEO of Apple by the board of directors. Fred D. Anderson was the head of the directors in short term and obtained short-term working capital from the banks in July 1997.[146][147] In August 1997, Jobs stepped in as the interim CEO to begin a critical restructuring of the company's product line.[5] He eventually became CEO and served in that position from January 2000 to August 2011.[6] On August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned his position as chief executive officer of Apple before his long battle with pancreatic cancer took his life on October 5, 2011.[148]\n\n\nOn November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the Apple Store, an online retail store based upon the WebObjects application server the company had acquired in its purchase of NeXT. The new direct sales outlet was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing strategy.[149][150]\n\n\n\n### Microsoft deal[edit]\n\n\nAt the 1997 Macworld Expo, Jobs announced that Apple would begin a partnership with Microsoft, with terms including a five-year commitment from Microsoft to release Microsoft Office for Macintosh, and a US$150 million investment in Apple. The long-standing dispute over whether Windows infringed Apple patents was settled,[151] and Internet Explorer would ship as the Macintosh's default browser, with the user able to have a preference. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates appeared on-screen explaining plans for developing Mac software, and expressing excitement to be helping Apple return to success. Jobs addressed the audience:\n\n\n\n\n> If we want to move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again, we have to let go of a few things here. We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose. We have to embrace a notion that for Apple to win, Apple has to do a really good job. And if others are going to help us that's great, because we need all the help we can get, and if we screw up and we don't do a good job, it's not somebody else's fault, it's our fault. So I think that is a very important perspective. If we want Microsoft Office on the Mac, we better treat the company that puts it out with a little bit of gratitude; we'd like their software.\n> So, the era of setting this up as a competition between Apple and Microsoft is over as far as I'm concerned. This is about getting Apple healthy, this is about Apple being able to make incredibly great contributions to the industry and to get healthy and prosper again.[152]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe day before the announcement Apple had a market cap of $2.46 billion,[153] and had ended its previous quarter with quarterly revenues of US$1.7 billion and cash reserves of US$1.2 billion,[154] making the US$150 million amount of the investment largely symbolic. Apple CFO Fred Anderson stated that Apple would use the additional funds to invest in its core markets of education and creative content.[151]\n\n\n\n### iMac, iBook, and Power Mac G4[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The original iMac (iMac G3) released in 1998\nWhile discontinuing Apple's licensing of its operating system to third-party computer manufacturers, one of Jobs's first moves as new acting CEO was to develop the iMac, which bought Apple time to restructure. The original iMac integrated a CRT display and CPU into a streamlined, translucent plastic body. The line became a sales smash, moving about one million units each year. It helped re-introduce Apple to the media and public and announced the company's new emphasis on the design and aesthetics of its products.\n\n\nIn 1999, Apple introduced the Power Mac G4, which utilized the Motorola-made PowerPC 7400 containing a 128-bit instruction unit known as AltiVec, its flagship processor line. Apple unveiled the iBook that year, its first consumer-oriented laptop, the first Macintosh to support the use of Wireless LAN via the optional AirPort card. Based on the 802.11b standard, it helped popularize Wireless LAN technology to connect computers to networks.\n\n\n\n### Mac OS X[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac OS X\n\n![](image)Company headquarters on Infinite Loop in Cupertino, California\nIn 2001, Apple introduced Mac OS X, an operating system based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP and incorporating parts of the FreeBSD kernel.[155] Aimed at consumers and professionals alike, Mac OS X married the stability, reliability and security of Unix with the ease of a completely overhauled user interface. To help users transition, the new operating system allowed the use of Mac OS 9 applications through the Classic environment. Apple's Carbon API allowed developers to adapt Mac OS 9 software to use Mac OS X's features.\n\n\n\n### Retail stores[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Store\n\nIn May 2001, after much speculation, Apple announced the opening of a line of Apple retail stores, to be located throughout the major U.S. computer buying markets. The stores were designed for two primary purposes: to stem the tide of Apple's declining share of the computer market and to respond to poor marketing of Apple products at third-party retail outlets.\n\n\n\n## 2001–2007: iPods, iTunes Store, Intel transition[edit]\n\n\n### iPod[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iPod\n\n![](image)A 1st-generation iPod (2001)\n![](image)iPod Mini with the UI (user interface) set to German\nIn October 2001, Apple introduced its first iPod portable digital audio player. Then iPod started as a 5 gigabyte player capable of storing around 1000 songs. Since then it has evolved into an array of products including the Mini (discontinued), the iPod Touch (discontinued), the Shuffle (discontinued), the iPod Classic (discontinued), the Nano (discontinued), the iPhone and the iPad. Since March 2011, the largest storage capacity for an iPod has been 160 gigabytes.[156] Speaking to software developers on June 6, 2005, Jobs said the company's share of the entire portable music device market stood at 76%.[157]\n\n\nThe iPod gave an enormous lift to Apple's financial results.[158] In the quarter ending March 26, 2005, Apple earned US$290 million, or 34¢ a share, on sales of US$3.24 billion. The year before in the same quarter, Apple earned just US$46 million, or 6¢ a share, on revenue of US$1.91 billion.\n\n\n\n### Moving on from colored plastics and the PowerPC G3[edit]\n\n\n![](image)iMac G4 (2002)\nIn early 2002, Apple unveiled a completely redesigned iMac, using the G4 processor and LCD display. The new iMac G4 design had a white hemispherical base and a flat panel all-digital display supported by a swiveling chrome neck. After several iterations increasing the processing speed and screen sizes from 15\" to 17\" to 20\" the iMac G4 was discontinued and replaced by the iMac G5 in the summer of 2004.\n\n\nLater in 2002, Apple released the Xserve 1U rack mounted server. Originally featuring two G4 chips, the Xserve was unusual for Apple in two ways. It represented an earnest effort to enter the enterprise computer market, and it was cheaper than competitors' similar machines. This was largely due to Fast ATA drives as opposed to the SCSI hard drives used in traditional rack-mounted servers. Apple later released the Xserve RAID, a 14 drive RAID that was again cheaper than competing systems.\n\n\nIn mid-2003, Jobs launched the Power Mac G5, based on IBM's G5 processor. Its all-metal anodized aluminum chassis finished Apple's transition away from colored plastics in their computers. Apple claims this was the first 64-bit computer sold to the general public. The Power Mac G5 was used by Virginia Tech to build its prototype System X supercomputing cluster, which at the time was considered the third-fastest supercomputer in the world. It cost only US$5.2 million to build, far less than the previous No. 3 and other ranking supercomputers. Apple's Xserves were updated to use the G5 as well. They replaced the Power Mac G5 machines as the main building block of Virginia Tech's System X, which was ranked in November 2004 as the world's seventh-fastest supercomputer.[159]\n\n\n\n![](image)iMac G5 (2004)\nA new iMac based on the G5 processor was unveiled August 31, 2004, and was made available in mid-September. This model dispensed with the base altogether, placing the CPU and the rest of the computing hardware behind the flat-panel screen, which is suspended from a streamlined aluminum foot. This new iMac, dubbed the iMac G5, was the \"world's thinnest desktop computer\",[160] measuring in at around two inches (around 5 centimeters).[161]\n\n\n2004 was a turning point for Apple. After creating a sizable financial base to work with, the company began experimenting with new parts from new suppliers. Apple could produce new designs quickly, and released the iPod Video, then the iPod Classic, and eventually the iPod touch and iPhone.\n\n\nOn April 29, 2005, Apple released Mac OS X v10.4 \"Tiger\".\n\n\nApple's successful PowerBook and iBook relied on previous generation G4 architecture produced by Freescale Semiconductor, a spin-off from Motorola. IBM engineers had some success in making their PowerPC G5 processor consume less power and run cooler, but not enough to run in iBook or PowerBook formats. In October 2005, Apple released the Power Mac G5 Dual featuring a Dual-Core processor – two cores in one rather than two separate processors. The Power Mac G5 Quad uses two Dual-Core processors. The Power Mac G5 Dual cores run individually at 2.0 GHz or 2.3 GHz. The Power Mac G5 Quad cores run individually at 2.5 GHz, and all variations have a graphics processor with 256-bit memory bandwidth.[162]\n\n\n\n### Retail store expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Apple Store in Ginza district, Tokyo\nInitially, Apple Stores were only in the United States, but in late 2003, Apple opened its first Apple Store abroad, in Tokyo's Ginza district. It was followed by a store in Osaka, Japan in August 2004. In 2005, Apple opened stores in Nagoya, the Shibuya district of Tokyo, Fukuoka, and Sendai. A store opened in Sapporo in 2006. Apple's first European store opened in London, on Regent Street, in November 2004. A store in the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham opened in April 2005, and the Bluewater shopping centre in Dartford, Kent opened in July 2005. Apple opened its first store in Canada in the middle of 2005 at the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in North York, Toronto. Later in 2005 Apple opened the Meadowhall Store in Sheffield and the Trafford Centre Store in Manchester, UK. Later additions in the London area include Brent Cross (January 2006), Westfield in Shepherd's Bush (September 2008), and Covent Garden (August 2010), which at 40,000 square feet (3,700 m2) was, as of 2015, the largest Apple Store in the world.[163]\n\n\nApple opened several \"mini\" stores in October 2004 to capture markets where demand does not necessarily dictate a full-scale store. The first of these stores was opened at Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto, California. These stores are only one half the square footage of the smallest normal store.\n\n\n\n### Apple and \"i\" Web services[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Apple introduced iTools, a set of free web-based tools that included an email account, internet greeting cards called iCards, a Web site review service called iReview, and \"KidSafe\", to prevent children browsing inappropriate websites. The latter two services were canceled because of lack of success. iCards and email were integrated into Apple's .Mac subscription-based service introduced in 2002 and discontinued in mid-2008 to make way for MobileMe, coinciding with the iPhone 3G release. MobileMe, at the same US$99.00 annual subscription as its dotMac predecessor, featured \"push\" services to instantly and automatically send emails, contacts and calendar updates directly to users' iPhones. Controversy around the release of MobileMe resulted in downtime and a significantly longer release window. Apple extended existing MobileMe subscriptions by 30 days free-of-charge.[164] At the WWDC event in June 2011, Apple announced iCloud, keeping most MobileMe services but dropping iDisk, Gallery, and iWeb. It added Find my Mac, iTunes Match, Photo Stream, Documents & Data Backup, and iCloud backup for iOS devices. The service requires iOS 5 and OS X 10.7 Lion.\n\n\n\n### iTunes Store[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iTunes Store\n\nThe iTunes Music Store was launched in April 2003, with 2 million downloads in the first 16 days. Music was purchased through the iTunes application, which was initially Macintosh-only; in October 2003, support for Windows was added. Initially, the music store was only available in the United States due to licensing restrictions.\n\n\nIn June 2004 Apple opened its iTunes Music Store in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. A version for the European Union version opened October 2004, but it was not initially available in the Republic of Ireland due to the intransigence of the Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA) but was opened there a few months later on Thursday, January 6, 2005. A version for Canada opened in December 2004. On May 10, 2005, the iTunes Music Store was expanded to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\n\nOn December 16, 2004, Apple sold its 200 millionth song on the iTunes Music Store to Ryan Alekman from Belchertown, Massachusetts. The download was *The Complete U2*, by U2.[165] Just under three months later Apple sold its 300 millionth song on March 2, 2005.[166] On July 17, 2005, the iTunes Music Store sold its 500 millionth song.[167] At that point, songs were selling at an accelerating annualized rate of more than 500 million.\n\n\nOn October 25, 2005, the iTunes Store went live in Australia, with songs selling for A$1.69 each, albums at (generally) A$16.99 and music videos and Pixar short films at A$3.39. Before the loophole was closed, people in New Zealand were briefly able to buy music from the Australian store\n\n\nOn February 23, 2006, the iTunes Music Store sold its 1 billionth song.[168]\n\n\nThe iTunes Music Store changed its name to iTunes Store on September 12, 2006, when it began offering video content (TV shows and movies) for sale. Since iTunes' inception, it has sold over 2 billion songs, 1.2 billion of which were sold in 2006. Since downloadable TV and movie content was added 50 million TV episodes and 1.3 million movies have been downloaded.\n\n\nIn early 2010, Apple celebrated the 10 billionth song downloaded from the iTunes Music Store.[169]\n\n\n\n### Intel transition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac transition to Intel processors\n\n![](image)MacBook Pro Intel-based (2006)\nIn a keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would produce Intel-based Macintosh computers beginning in 2006.[170] Jobs confirmed rumors that the company had been secretly producing versions of Mac OS X for both PowerPC and Intel processors over the past 5 years, and that the transition to Intel processor systems would last until the end of 2007. Rumors of cross-platform compatibility had been spurred by the fact that Mac OS X is based on OPENSTEP, an operating system that was available for many platforms. Apple's own Darwin, the open source underpinnings of Mac OS X, was also available for Intel's x86 architecture.[171][172][173]\n\n\nOn January 10, 2006, the Intel-based iMac and MacBook Pro were introduced,[174][175] based on the Intel Core Duo platform. They came alongside news that Apple would complete the transition to Intel processors on all hardware by the end of 2006, a year ahead of the originally quoted schedule.\n\n\n\n## 2007–2011: Apple Inc., iPhone, iOS, iPad[edit]\n\n\nOn January 9, 2007, Apple Computer, Inc. shortened its name to simply Apple Inc. In his Macworld Expo keynote address, Jobs explained that with their current product mix consisting of the iPod and Apple TV as well as their Macintosh brand, Apple really wasn't just a computer company anymore. At the same address, Jobs revealed a product that would revolutionize an industry in which Apple had never previously competed: the Apple iPhone. The iPhone combined Apple's first widescreen iPod with the world's first mobile device boasting visual voicemail, and an internet communicator able to run a fully-functional version of Apple's web browser, Safari, on the then-named iPhone OS (later renamed iOS).\n\n\n\n### iOS evolution: iPhone and iPad[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: iOS, iPhone, and iPad\n\n![](image)The original iPhone (2007)\nThe first version of the iPhone became publicly available on June 29, 2007, in selected countries/markets. It was another 12 months before the iPhone 3G became available on July 11, 2008. Apple announced the iPhone 3GS on June 8, 2009, along with plans to release it later in June, July, and August, starting with the U.S., Canada, and major European countries on June 19. This 12-month iteration cycle has continued with the iPhone 4 model arriving in similar fashion in 2010, a Verizon model was released in February 2011, and a Sprint model in October 2011, shortly after Jobs' death.\n\n\nOn February 10, 2011, the iPhone 4 was made available on both Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Now two iPod types are multi-touch: the iPod nano and the iPod touch, a big advance in technology. Apple TV currently has a 2nd-generation model, which is 4 times smaller than the original Apple TV. Apple has also gone wireless, selling a wireless trackpad, keyboard, mouse, and external hard drive. Wired accessories are still available.\n\n\nThe Apple iPad was announced on January 27, 2010, with retail availability commencing in April and systematically growing in markets throughout 2010. The iPad fits into Apple's iOS product line, being twice the screen size of an iPhone without the phone abilities. While there were initial fears of product cannibalization the FY2010 financial results released in Jan 2011 included commentary of a reverse 'halo' effect, where iPad sales were leading to increased sales of iMacs and MacBooks.[176]\n\n\n\n### Resurgence compared to Microsoft[edit]\n\n\nSince 2005, Apple's revenues, profits, and stock price have grown significantly. On May 26, 2010, Apple's stock market value overtook Microsoft's,[177][178][179] and Apple's revenues surpassed those of Microsoft in the third quarter of 2010.[180][181] After giving their results for the first quarter of 2011, Microsoft's net profits of $5.2 billion were lower for the quarter than those of Apple, which earned $6 billion in net profit for the quarter.[182][183] The late April announcement of profits by the companies marked the first time in 20 years that Microsoft's profits had been lower than Apple's,[184] a situation described by *Ars Technica* as \"unimaginable a decade ago\".[182]\n\n\n*The Guardian* reported that one of the reasons for the change was because PC software, where Microsoft dominates, has become less important compared to the tablet and smartphone markets, where Apple has a strong presence.[184] One reason for this was a surprise drop in PC sales in the quarter.[184] Another issue for Microsoft was that its online search business had lost a lot of money, with a loss of $700 million in the first quarter of 2010.[184]\n\n\n\n## 2011–2020: Restructuring and Apple Watch[edit]\n\n\nOn March 2, 2011, Apple unveiled the iPad's second-generation model, the iPad 2. Like the 4th-generation iPod Touch and iPhone, the iPad 2 comes with a front-facing camera as well as a rear-facing camera, along with three new apps that utilize these new features: Camera, FaceTime, and Photo Booth.\n\n\nOn August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned from his position as CEO[185] with Tim Cook taking his place. On October 29, 2012, Apple announced structural changes to increase collaboration between hardware, software, and services.[186] This involved the departure of Scott Forstall, responsible for the launch of iOS (iPhone OS at the time of launch), who was replaced with Craig Federighi as head of iOS and OS X teams. Jony Ive became head of HI (Human Interface), whilst Eddy Cue was announced as head of online services including Siri and Maps. The most notable short term difference of this restructuring was the launch of iOS 7, the first version of the operating system to use a drastically different design to its predecessors, headed by Jony Ive,[187] followed by OS X Yosemite a year later with a similar design.\n\n\nDuring this time, Apple released the iPhone 5, the first iPhone to have a screen larger than 3.5\",[188] the iPod Touch 5 with a 4\" screen, the iPhone 5S with fingerprint scanning technology in the form of Touch ID, and iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, with screens at 4.7\" and 5.5\". They released the 3rd-generation iPad with Retina Display, followed by the 4th-generation iPad just half a year later. The iPad Mini was announced alongside the iPad 4th gen, and was the first to feature a smaller screen than 9.7\". This was followed by the iPad Mini 2 with Retina Display in 2013, alongside the iPad Air, a continuation of the original 9.7\" range of iPads, which was subsequently followed by the iPad Air 2 with Touch ID in 2014. Apple released various major Mac updates, including the MacBook Pro with Retina Display,[189] whilst discontinuing the original MacBook range for a short period, before reintroducing it in 2015 with various new features, a Retina Display and a new design that implemented USB-C, while removing all other ports.[190] The Mac Pro and iMac were updated with more power and a drastically smaller and thinner profile.\n\n\nOn November 25, 2013, Apple acquired a company called PrimeSense.[191] On May 28, 2014, Apple acquired Beats Electronics, producers of the popular Beats by Dre headphone and speaker range, as well as streaming service Beats Music.\n\n\n\n![](image)Apple Watch first generation (2015)\nOn September 9, 2014, Apple announced the Apple Watch, the first new product range since the departure of Jobs.[192] The product cannot function beyond basic features without being within Bluetooth or WiFi range to an iPhone and contains basic applications (many acting as a remote for other devices, such as a music remote, or a control for an Apple TV) and fitness tracking. The Apple Watch received mixed reviews, with critics suggesting that whilst the device showed promise, it lacked a clear purpose, similar to many of the devices already on the market.[193] The Apple Watch was released on April 24, 2015.[194]\n\n\nOn September 9, 2015, Apple announced the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus with 3D Touch, the iPad Pro, and the fourth-generation Apple TV, along with the fourth-generation iPad Mini.\nOn March 21, 2016, Apple announced the first-generation iPhone SE and the smaller iPad Pro.\n\n\nOn September 7, 2016, Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with an improved camera and a faster processor than the previous generation. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have high storage options.\nOn October 27, 2016, Apple announced the new 13 and 15 inch MacBook Pro with a retina Touch Bar.\nOn March 21, 2017, Apple announced the iPad (2017). This is the iPad Air 2 successor, equipped with a faster processor, and starts at $329. Apple also announced the (Product)RED iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.\n\n\nOn June 5, 2017, Apple announced iOS 11 as well as new versions of macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Updated versions of the iMac, MacBook Pro, and MacBook were released, along with the 10.5 and 12.9 inch iPad Pro, and \"HomePod\", a Siri speaker similar to the Amazon Echo.\n\n\nOn September 12, 2017, at the Steve Jobs Theater, Apple introduced the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus with better camera features, more improvements in product design, user experience, performance and more, and announced the iPhone X with facial recognition technology and wireless charging. Apple announced the 4K Apple TV with 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision experience, and the Apple Watch Series 3, supporting a cellular connection, running watchOS 4.\n\n\nOn September 12, 2018, at the Steve Jobs Theater, Apple introduced the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR, running iOS 12, with improved facial recognition and HDR in the display as well as better cameras for all 3 phones. They also announced the Apple Watch Series 4, running watchOS 5, with an all-new design and larger display as well as many more health-related features.\n\n\nIn 2018, Bloomberg News reported that, as early as 2015, a specialized unit of China's People's Liberation Army began inserting chips into Supermicro servers that allowed for backdoor access to them.[195] Approximately 30 companies reportedly had their servers compromised via the chips, including Apple Inc.[195]\n\n\nOn September 20, 2019, the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max were introduced. The iPhone 11 Pro was the first iPhone to feature three cameras.\n\n\n\n## 2020–present: 5G and Apple silicon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)MacBook Air M1 (2020)\nIn June 2020, at the first ever virtual WWDC, CEO Tim Cook announced the transition from Intel processors to Apple silicon in Macs.\n\n\nIn September 2020, the iPhone 12, 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max were introduced, being the first iPhones to support 5G.\n\n\nIn November 2020, the first Mac's with Apple silicon were launched. The Mac mini, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro all featured Apple's M1 chip, itself based on the previous A14 Bionic chip.\n\n\nIn April 2021, the M1-powered iPad was launched, along with a new M1-powered iMac offered in 7 colors, recalling the iMacs offered in 5 colors announced in 1999. Apple launched an iPhone 12 in purple and a GPS tracking device called AirTag that uses the Apple's Find My device network.\n\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Apple repeated its pattern of introducing four new iPhones in September, with 2021's iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro lines and 2022's iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro lines, with the iPhone 14 Pro ditching the notch containing the sensors for a \"dynamic island\" which allows for space between the top edge of the screen and the sensors for Face ID. 2022 saw Apple announce the first Macs with Apple's M2 chip and a new sub-series of Apple Watch with increased performance for outdoor activities named Apple Watch Ultra.\n\n\nApple launched a buy now, pay later service called 'Apple Pay Later' for its Apple Wallet users in March 2023. The program allows its users to apply for loans between $50 and $1,000 to make online or in-app purchases and then repaying them through four installments spread over six weeks without any interest or fees.[196][197]\n\n\n\n## Financial history[edit]\n\n\nAs cash reserves increased significantly in 2006, Apple created Braeburn Capital on April 6, 2006, to manage its assets.[198]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Financial period\n | Net sales (million USD)\n | Net profits (million USD)\n | Revenue growth\n | Return on net sales\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FY 1977[199] | 0.773\n | n/a\n | ---\n | ---\n |\n| FY 1978\n | 7.856\n | 0.793\n | 920%\n | 10%\n |\n| FY 1979\n | 47.867\n | 5.073\n | 508%\n | 11%\n |\n| FY 1980\n | 117.126\n | 11.698\n | 146%\n | 10%\n |\n| FY 1981[200] | 335\n | 39.420\n | 184%\n | 12%\n |\n| FY 1982\n | 583\n | 61\n | 74%\n | 10%\n |\n| FY 1983\n | 983\n | 77\n | 69%\n | 8%\n |\n| FY 1984\n | 1,516\n | 64\n | 54%\n | 4%\n |\n| FY 1985\n | 1,918\n | 61\n | 27%\n | 3%\n |\n| FY 1986\n | 1,902\n | 154\n | -1%\n | 8%\n |\n| FY 1987\n | 2,661\n | 218\n | 40%\n | 8%\n |\n| FY 1988\n | 4,071\n | 400\n | 53%\n | 10%\n |\n| FY 1989\n | 5,284\n | 454\n | 30%\n | 9%\n |\n| FY 1990\n | 5,558\n | 475\n | 5%\n | 9%\n |\n| FY 1991\n | 6,309\n | 310\n | 12%\n | 5%\n |\n| FY 1992\n | 7,087\n | 530\n | 12%\n | 7%\n |\n| FY 1993\n | 7,977\n | 87\n | 13%\n | 1%\n |\n| FY 1994\n | 9,189\n | 310\n | 15%\n | 3%\n |\n| FY 1995\n | 11,062\n | 424\n | 20%\n | 4%\n |\n| FY 1996\n | 9,833\n | −816\n | −11%\n | −8%\n |\n| FY 1997\n | 7,081\n | −1,045\n | −28%\n | −15%\n |\n| FY 1998\n | 5,941\n | 309\n | −16%\n | 5%\n |\n| FY 1999\n | 6,134\n | 601\n | 3%\n | 10%\n |\n| FY 2000\n | 7,983\n | 786\n | 30%\n | 10%\n |\n| FY 2001\n | 5,363\n | −37\n | −33%\n | −1%\n |\n| FY 2002\n | 5,724\n | 65\n | 7%\n | 1%\n |\n| FY 2003\n | 6,207\n | 57\n | 8%\n | 1%\n |\n| FY 2004\n | 8,279\n | 266\n | 33%\n | 3%\n |\n| FY 2005\n | 13,931\n | 1,328\n | 68%\n | 10%\n |\n| FY 2006\n | 19,315\n | 1,989\n | 39%\n | 10%\n |\n| FY 2007\n | 24,006\n | 3,496\n | 24%\n | 15%\n |\n| FY 2008\n | 32,479\n | 4,834\n | 35%\n | 15%\n |\n| FY 2009[201] | 42,905\n | 8,235\n | 32%\n | 19%\n |\n| FY 2010\n | 65,225\n | 14,013\n | 52%\n | 21%\n |\n| FY 2011\n | 108,249\n | 25,922\n | 66%\n | 24%\n |\n| FY 2012\n | 156,508\n | 41,733\n | 45%\n | 27%\n |\n| FY 2013\n | 170,910\n | 37,037\n | 9%\n | 22%\n |\n| FY 2014\n | 182,795\n | 39,510\n | 7%\n | 22%\n |\n| FY 2015\n | 233,715\n | 53,394\n | 28%\n | 23%\n |\n| FY 2016\n | 215,639\n | 45,687\n | −8%\n | 21%\n |\n| FY 2017\n | 229,234\n |  |  |  |\n| FY 2018\n | 265,595\n | 59,531\n | 15%\n | \\_\n |\n\n\n### Stock[edit]\n\n\n'AAPL' is the stock symbol under which Apple Inc. trades on the NASDAQ stock market. Apple originally went public on December 12, 1980, with an initial public offering at US$22.00[202] per share. The stock has split 2 for 1 three times on June 15, 1987, June 21, 2000, and February 28, 2005. Apple initially paid dividends from June 15, 1987, to December 15, 1995. On March 19, 2012, Apple announced that it would again start paying a dividend of $2.65 per quarter (beginning in the quarter that starts in July 2012) along a $10 billion share buyback that would commence September 30, 2012, the start of its fiscal 2013 year.\n\n\nGene Munster and Michael Olson of Piper Jaffray are the main analysts who track Apple stock. Piper Jaffray estimates future stock and revenue of Apple annually, and have been doing so for several years.[203]\n\n\n\n## Timeline of Apple Inc. products[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Timeline of Apple Inc. products * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n\nSee also: Timeline of the Apple II series and List of Mac models\n\n*Products on this timeline indicate introduction dates only and not necessarily discontinued dates, as new products begin on a contiguous product line.* |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Anisimova, Milena (March 8, 2022). \"Apple Logo History: All About Apple Logo Evolution\". *The Designest*.

Apple's core product lines are the iPhone smartphone, iPad tablet computer, and the Macintosh personal computer. The company offers its products online and has a chain of retail stores known as Apple Stores. Founders Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne created Apple Computer Co. on April 1, 1976, to market Wozniak's Apple I desktop computer,[2] and Jobs and Wozniak incorporated the company on January 3, 1977,[3] in Cupertino, California.\n\n\nFor more than three decades, Apple Computer was predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and Power Mac lines, but it faced rocky sales and low market share during the 1990s. Jobs, who had been ousted from the company in 1985, returned to Apple in 1997 after his company NeXT was bought by Apple.[4] The following year he became the company's interim CEO,[5] which later became permanent.[6] Jobs subsequently instilled a new corporate philosophy of recognizable products and simple design, starting with the original iMac in 1998.\n\n\nWith the introduction of the successful iPod music player in 2001 and iTunes Music Store in 2003, Apple established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics and media sales industries, leading it to drop \"Computer\" from the company's name in 2007. The company is also known for its iOS range of smart phone, media player, and tablet computer products that began with the iPhone, followed by the iPod Touch and then iPad. As of June 30, 2015, Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization,[7] with an estimated value of US$1 trillion as of August 2, 2018.[8] Apple's worldwide annual revenue in 2010 totaled US$65 billion, growing to US$127.8 billion in 2011[9] and $156 billion in 2012.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## 1971–1985: Jobs and Wozniak[edit]\n\n\n### Pre-foundation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steve Wozniak's \"blue box\" at the Computer History Museum\nSteve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, referred to collectively as \"the two Steves\", first met in mid-1971, when their mutual friend Bill Fernandez introduced then 21-year-old Wozniak to 16-year-old Jobs.[11][12] Their first business partnership began in the fall of that year when Wozniak, a self-educated electronics engineer, read an article in *Esquire* magazine that described a device that could place free long-distance phone calls by emitting specific tone chirps. Wozniak started to build his original “blue boxes”, which he tested by calling the Vatican City pretending to be Henry Kissinger wanting to speak to the pope.[13] Jobs managed to sell some two hundred blue boxes for $150 each, and split the profit with Wozniak.[11][12] Jobs later told his biographer that if it hadn't been for Wozniak's blue boxes, \"there wouldn't have been an Apple.\"[14]\n\n\nBy 1972, Jobs had withdrawn from Reed College and Wozniak from UC Berkeley. Wozniak designed a video terminal that he could use to log on to the minicomputers at Call Computer. Alex Kamradt commissioned the design and sold a small number of them through his firm. Aside from their interest in up-to-date technology, the impetus for the two Steves seems to have had another source. In his essay *From Satori to Silicon Valley* (published 1986), cultural historian Theodore Roszak made the point that Apple Computer emerged from within the West Coast counterculture and the need to produce print-outs, letter labels, and databases. Roszak offers a bit of background on the development of the two Steves' prototype models.\n\n\nIn 1975, the two Steves started attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club.[15] New microcomputers such as the Altair 8800 and the IMSAI 8080 inspired Wozniak to build a microprocessor into his video terminal circuit to make a complete computer. At the time the only microcomputer CPUs generally available were the $179 Intel 8080 (equivalent to $1,014 in 2023), and the $170 Motorola 6800 (equivalent to $963 in 2023). Wozniak preferred the 6800, but both were out of his price range. So he watched, and learned, and designed computers on paper, waiting for the day he could afford a CPU.\n\n\nWhen MOS Technology released its $20 (equivalent to $107 in 2023) 6502 chip in 1976, Wozniak wrote a version of BASIC for it, then began to design a computer for it to run on. The 6502 was designed by the same people who designed the 6800, as many in Silicon Valley left employers to form their own companies. Wozniak's earlier 6800 paper-computer needed only minor changes to run on the new chip.\n\n\nBy March 1, 1976, Wozniak completed the machine and took it to a Homebrew Computer Club meeting to show it off.[16] When Jobs saw Wozniak's computer, which later became the Apple I, he was immediately interested in its commercial potential.[17] Initially, Wozniak intended to share schematics of the machine for free, but Jobs insisted that they should instead build and sell bare printed circuit boards for the computer.[18] Wozniak originally offered the design to Hewlett-Packard (HP), where he worked at the time, but was denied by the company on five occasions.[19] Jobs eventually convinced Wozniak to go into business together and start a new company of their own.[20] In order to raise the money they needed to produce the first batch of printed circuit boards, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Type 2 minibus for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak his HP-65 programmable calculator for $500.[18][16][21][22]\n\n\n\n### Apple I and company formation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steve Jobs' parents' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, where Apple started its operation.[23] Initial work took place in his bedroom and later moved to the home's garage.[15]\n![](image)Wozniak's Apple I design was sold as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case.\n![](image)\nThe first Apple logo, drawn by Ronald Wayne, depicts Isaac Newton under an apple tree.\n![](image)\nCreated by Rob Janoff in 1977, the Apple logo with the rainbow scheme was used from April of that year[24] until August 26, 1999.[*citation needed*]\n\nOn April 1, 1976, Apple Computer Company was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne.[25][20] The company was registered as a California business partnership.[26]\nWayne, who worked at Atari as a chief draftsman, became a co-founder in return for a 10% stake.[27][20][2] Wayne was gun-shy due to the failure of his own venture four years earlier. On April 12, less than two weeks after the company's formation, Wayne left Apple, selling his 10% share back to the two Steves for $800.[28][29]\n\n\nAccording to Wozniak, Jobs proposed the name “Apple Computer” when he had just come back from Robert Friedland's All-One Farm in Oregon.[29] Jobs told Walter Isaacson that he was \"on one of my fruitarian diets,\" when he conceived of the name and thought \"it sounded fun, spirited and not intimidating ... plus, it would get us ahead of Atari in the phone book.\"[30]\n\n\nThe two Steves made a last trip to the Homebrew Computer Club and demonstrated the Apple I (AKA: The Apple Computer).[31] Paul Terrell, who operated the computer store chain *Byte Shop*, was impressed,[27] and gave the two Steves his card, asking them to keep in touch.[32] The next day, Jobs visited Terrell at the Mountain View Byte Shop store, and tried to sell him the bare circuit boards for the Apple I.[29] Terrell said he was only interested in purchasing the machine fully assembled, and that he would order 50 assembled computers and pay US$500 each on delivery (equivalent to $2,700 in 2023).[33][34][27] Jobs took the purchase order from the Byte Shop to national electronic parts distributor Cramer Electronics, and ordered the components needed. When asked by the credit manager how he would pay for the parts, Jobs replied, \"I have this purchase order from the Byte Shop chain of computer stores for 50 of my computers and the payment terms are COD. If you give me the parts on net 30-day terms I can build and deliver the computers in that time frame, collect my money from Terrell at the Byte Shop and pay you.\"[35][36]\n\n\nTo verify the purchase order, the credit manager called Paul Terrell, who assured him if the computers showed up, Jobs would have more than enough money for the parts order. The two Steves and their small crew spent day and night building and testing the computers, and delivered to Terrell on time. Terrell was surprised to receive a batch of assembled circuit boards, as he had expected complete computers with a case, monitor and keyboard.[37][38] Nonetheless, he kept his word and paid the two Steves the money promised.[39][37][38][40]\n\n\nThe Apple I went on sale in July 1976 as an assembled circuit board with a retail price of $666.66.[41][42][43] Wozniak later said he had had no idea about the relation between the number and the mark of the beast, and that he came up with the price because he liked repeating digits.[39] About 200 units of the Apple I were eventually sold.[44]\n\n\nThe Apple I computer had some notable features, including the use of a TV display, whereas many machines had no display at all. This was not like the displays of later machines; the text was displayed at 60 characters per second – still faster than the teleprinters of contemporary machines of that era. The machine had bootstrap code on ROM, making it easier to start up. At the insistence of Paul Terrell, Wozniak designed a cassette interface for loading and saving programs, at the then-rapid pace of 1200 bit/s. The simple machine was a masterpiece of design using far fewer parts than anything in its class, and earned Wozniak his reputation as a designer.\n\n\nJobs looked for investments to expand the business,[38] but banks were reluctant to lend him money; the idea of a computer for ordinary people seemed absurd at the time. In August 1976, Jobs approached his former boss at Atari, Nolan Bushnell, who recommended that he meet with Don Valentine, the founder of Sequoia Capital.[38] Valentine was not interested in funding Apple, but in turn introduced Jobs to Mike Markkula, a millionaire who had worked under him at Fairchild Semiconductor.[38] Markkula saw great potential in the two Steves, and became an angel investor of their company.[45] He invested $92,000 in Apple out of his own property while securing a $250,000 (equivalent to $1,340,000 in 2023) line of credit from Bank of America.[45][38] In return, Markkula received a one-third stake in Apple.[45] Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977.[38] The new corporation bought out the partnership the two Steves had formed nine months earlier.[46]\n\n\nIn February 1977, Markkula recruited Michael Scott from National Semiconductor to serve as the first president and CEO of Apple Computer, as the two Steves were both insufficiently experienced and he was not interested in taking that position himself.[47][48]\nThat same month, Wozniak resigned from his job at Hewlett-Packard to work full-time for Apple.[46][49]\n\n\n\n### Apple II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple II series\n\n![](image)\nApple II Plus, designed primarily by Wozniak\n![](image)\nDisk II, also designed by Wozniak\n\nAlmost as soon as Apple had started selling its first computers, Wozniak moved on from the Apple I and began designing a greatly improved computer: the Apple II.[45] Wozniak completed a working prototype of the new machine by August 1976.[38][50] The two Steves presented the Apple II computer to the public at the first West Coast Computer Faire on April 16 and 17, 1977. On the first day of the exhibition, Jobs introduced the Apple II to a Japanese chemist named Toshio Mizushima, who became the first authorized Apple dealer in Japan. In the May 1977 issue of *Byte*, Wozniak said of the Apple II design, \"To me, a personal computer should be small, reliable, convenient to use, and inexpensive.\"[51]\n\n\nThe Apple II went on sale on June 10, 1977, with a retail price of $1,298.[52] The computer's main internal difference from its predecessor was a completely redesigned TV interface, which held the display in memory. Now not only useful for simple text display, the Apple II included graphics and, eventually, color. During the development of the Apple II, Jobs pressed for a well-designed plastic case and built-in keyboard, with the idea that the machine should be fully packaged and ready to run out of the box.[53] This was almost the case for the Apple I computers, but one still needed to plug various parts together and type in the code to run BASIC. Jobs wanted the Apple II case to be \"simple and elegant\", and hired an industrial designer named Jerry Manock to produce such a case design.[53] Apple employee #5 Rod Holt developed the switching power supply.[54]\n\n\nWhile early Apple II models use ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded in 1978 by the introduction of a 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II.[55][56] The Disk II system was designed by Wozniak and released with a retail price of $495.[55]\n\n\nIn 1979, the Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first \"killer application\" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet.[55] So important that the Apple II became what John Markoff described as a \"VisiCalc accessory\",[57] the application created a business market for the computer and gave home users an additional reason to buy it: compatibility with the office.[55] Before VisiCalc, Apple had been a distant third place competitor to Commodore and Tandy.[58][59]\n\n\nThe Apple II was one of the three \"1977 Trinity\" computers generally credited with creating the home computer market (the other two being the Commodore PET and the Tandy Corporation TRS-80).[60] A number of different models of the Apple II were built thereafter, including the Apple IIe and Apple IIGS,[61] which continued in public use for nearly two decades. The Apple II series went on to sell about six million units in total before it was discontinued in 1993.[62][63]\n\n\n\n### Apple III[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple III\n\n![](image)Apple III with Apple Monitor III\nWhile the Apple II was already established as a successful business-ready platform because of VisiCalc, Apple management was not content. The Apple III was designed to take on the business environment in an attempt to compete with IBM in the business and corporate computing market.[64] The development of the Apple III started in late 1978 under the guidance of Wendell Sander,[65] and was subsequently developed by a committee headed by Jobs.[66] The Apple III was first announced on May 19, 1980, with a retail price ranging from $4,340\nto $7,800, and released in November 1980.[66]\n\n\nThe Apple III was a conservative design for the era, however Jobs wanted the heat generated by the electronics to be dissipated through the chassis of the machine rather than by the more usual cooling fan. The case was not sufficient to cool the components and the Apple III was prone to overheating, causing the integrated circuit chips to disconnect from the motherboard. Customers who contacted Apple customer service were told to \"raise the computers six inches in the air, and then let go\", which would cause the integrated circuits to fall back into place.\n\n\nThousands of Apple III computers were recalled. A new model was introduced in 1983 to try to rectify the problems, but the damage was already done.\n\n\n\n### Apple IPO[edit]\n\n\nIn the July 1980 issue of *Kilobaud Microcomputing*, publisher Wayne Green stated that \"the best consumer ads I've seen have been those by Apple. They are attention-getting, and they must be prompting sale.\"[67] In August, the *Financial Times* reported that\n\n\n\n\n> Apple Computer, the fast growing Californian manufacturer of small computers for the consumer, business and educational markets, is planning to go public later this year. [It] is the largest private manufacturer in the U.S. of small computers. Founded about five years ago as a small workshop business, it has become the second largest manufacturer of small computers, after the Radio Shack division of the Tandy company.[68]\n> \n> \n\n\nOn December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol \"AAPL\") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of November 30, 2020[update]),[69] generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[70] Several venture capitalists cashed out, reaping billions in long-term capital gains. By the end of the day, the stock rose to $29 per share and 300 millionaires were created, including the two Steves.[71][72] Around this time Wozniak offered $10 million of his own stock to early Apple employees, something Jobs refused to do.[71] Apple's market cap was $1.778 billion at the end of its first day of trading.[70][72]\n\n\nIn January 1981, Apple held its first shareholders meeting as a public company in the Flint Center, a large auditorium at nearby De Anza College (which is often used for symphony concerts) to handle the larger numbers of shareholders post-IPO. The business of the meeting had been planned so that the voting could be staged in 15 minutes or less. In most cases, voting proxies are collected by mail and counted days or months before a meeting. In this case, after the IPO, many shares were in new hands.\n\n\nJobs started his prepared speech, but after being interrupted by voting several times, he dropped his prepared speech and delivered a long, emotionally charged talk about betrayal, lack of respect, and related topics.[73]\n\n\n\n### Competition from the IBM PC[edit]\n\n\nBy August 1981 Apple was among the three largest microcomputer companies, perhaps having replaced Radio Shack as the leader;[74] revenue in the first half of the year had already exceeded 1980's $118 million, and *InfoWorld* reported that lack of production capacity was constraining growth.[75] Because of VisiCalc businesses purchased 90% of Apple II computers;[76][77] large customers especially preferred Apple.[78]\n\n\nIBM entered the personal computer market that month with the IBM PC[79][80] in part because it did not want products without IBM logos on customers' desks,[81] but Apple had many advantages. While IBM began with one microcomputer, little available hardware or software, and a couple of hundred dealers, Apple had five times as many dealers in the US and an established international distribution network. The Apple II had an installed base of more than 250,000 customers, and hundreds of independent developers offered software and peripherals; at least ten databases and ten word processors were available, while the PC had no databases and one word processor.[82]\n\n\nThe company's customers gained a reputation for devotion and loyalty. *BYTE* in 1984 stated that[83]\n\n\n\n\n> There are two kinds of people in the world: people who say Apple isn't just a company, it's a cause; and people who say Apple isn't a cause, it's just a company. Both groups are right. Nature has suspended the principle of noncontradiction where Apple is concerned.\n> Apple is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth ... Apple is two guys in a garage undertaking the mission of bringing computing power, once reserved for big corporations, to ordinary individuals with ordinary budgets. The company's growth from two guys to a billion-dollar corporation exemplifies the American Dream. Even as a large corporation, Apple plays David to IBM's Goliath, and thus has the sympathetic role in that myth.\n> \n> \n\n\nThe magazine noted that the loyalty was not entirely positive for Apple; customers were willing to overlook real flaws in its products, even while holding the company to a higher standard than for competitors.[83] The Apple III was an example of its autocratic reputation among dealers[78] that one described as \"Apple arrogance\".[84] After examining a PC and finding it unimpressive, Apple confidently purchased a full-page advertisement in *The Wall Street Journal* with the headline \"Welcome, IBM. Seriously\".[85][80] The company prioritized the III for three years, spending what Wozniak estimated as $100 million on marketing and R&D while not improving the Apple II to compete with the PC, as doing so could hurt III sales.[77]\n\n\nMicrosoft head Bill Gates was at Apple headquarters the day of IBM's announcement and later said \"They didn't seem to care. It took them a full year to realize what had happened\".[80] The PC almost completely ended sales of the III, the company's most comparable product. The II still sold well,[81] with Apple being the leading computer manufacturer in the United States where 7 million units were sold between 1978 and 1982.[86] But by 1983, the PC surpassed the Apple II as the best-selling personal computer.[87] IBM recruited the best Apple dealers while avoiding the discount grey market they disliked.[81] The head of a retail chain said \"It appears that IBM had a better understanding of why the Apple II was successful than had Apple\".[78] Gene Amdahl predicted that Apple would be another of the many \"brash young companies\" that IBM had defeated.[88]\n\n\nBy 1984 the press called the two companies archrivals,[89] but IBM had $4 billion in annual PC revenue, more than twice that of Apple and as much as the sales of it and the next three companies combined.[90] A *Fortune* survey found that 56% of American companies with personal computers used IBM PCs, compared to 16% for Apple.[91] Small businesses, schools, and some homes became the II's primary market.[76]\n\n\n\n### Xerox PARC and the Lisa[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Lisa\n\n![](image)Apple Lisa\nApple Computer's business division was focused on the Apple III, another iteration of the text-based computer. Simultaneously the Lisa group worked on a new machine that would feature a completely different interface and introduce the words *mouse*, *icon*, and *desktop* into the lexicon of the computing public. In return for the right to buy US$1,000,000 of pre-IPO stock, Xerox granted Apple Computer three days access to the PARC facilities. After visiting PARC, they came away with new ideas that would complete the foundation for Apple Computer's first GUI computer, the Apple Lisa.[92][93][94][95]\n\n\nThe first iteration of Apple's WIMP interface was a floppy disk where files could be spatially moved around. After months of usability testing, Apple designed the Lisa interface of windows and icons.\n\n\nThe Lisa was introduced in 1983 at a cost of US$9,995 (equivalent to $30,600 in 2023). Because of the high price, Lisa failed to penetrate the business market.\n\n\n\n### Macintosh and the \"1984\" commercial[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the Macintosh and 1984 (advertisement)\n\n![](image)Macintosh 128K\nBy 1984 computer dealers saw Apple as the only clear alternative to IBM's influence;[96] some even promoted its products to reduce dependence on the PC.[81] The company announced the Macintosh 128K to the press in October 1983, followed by an 18-page brochure included with magazines in December.[97] Its debut was announced by a single national broadcast of a US$1.5 million television commercial, \"1984\" (equivalent to $4,400,000 in 2023). Directed by Ridley Scott and aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984,[98] it is considered a \"watershed event\"[99] and a \"masterpiece.\"[100] The commercial alludes to George Orwell's novel *Nineteen Eighty-Four* which describes a dystopian future of enforced conformity. In the commercial a heroine represents the coming of the Macintosh to save humanity,[101] and ends with the words: \"On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984.”[102]\n\n\nOn January 24, 1984, the Macintosh went on sale with a retail price of $2,495.[103][104] It came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface: MacWrite and MacPaint. On the same day, an emotional Jobs introduced the computer to a wildly enthusiastic audience at Apple's annual shareholders meeting held in the Flint Auditorium;[105][106] Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld described the scene as \"pandemonium\".[107] Jobs had directed the development of the Macintosh since 1981, when he took over the project from early Apple employee Jef Raskin, who conceived the computer,[108][109] and Wozniak, who led the initial design and development with Raskin but was on leave during this time due to an airplane crash earlier that year, making it easier for Jobs to take over the program.[110][111] The Macintosh was based on The Lisa (and Xerox PARC's mouse-driven graphical user interface),[112][113] and it was widely acclaimed by the media with strong initial sales supporting it.[114][115] However, the slow processing speed and limited software led to a rapid sales decline in the second half of 1984.[114][115][116]\n\n\nThe Macintosh was too radical for some, who labeled it a mere \"toy\". Because the machine was entirely designed around the GUI, existing text-mode and command-driven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten; this was a challenging undertaking that many software developers shied away from, and resulted in an initial lack of software for the new system. In April 1984 Microsoft's Multiplan migrated over from MS-DOS, followed by Microsoft Word in January 1985.[117] In 1985, Lotus Software introduced Lotus Jazz after the success of Lotus 1-2-3 for the IBM PC, although it was largely a flop.[118] Apple introduced Macintosh Office the same year with the lemmings ad, infamous for insulting potential customers. It was not successful.[119]\n\n\nFor a special post-election edition of *Newsweek* in November 1984, Apple spent more than US$2.5 million to buy all 39 of the advertising pages in the issue.[120] Apple also ran a \"Test Drive a Macintosh\" promotion, in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards. While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad shape that they could no longer be sold. This marketing campaign caused CEO John Sculley to raise the price from US$1,995 (equivalent to $5,900 in 2023) to US$2,495 (equivalent to $7,300 in 2023).[119] The Macintosh spawned the concept of Mac evangelism, which was pioneered by Apple employee, and later Apple Fellow, Guy Kawasaki.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Jobs and Wozniak leave Apple[edit]\n\n\nBy early 1985, the Macintosh's failure to defeat the IBM PC[114][115] triggered a power struggle between Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired two years earlier by Jobs[121][122] using the famous line, \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\"[123] Sculley and Jobs' visions for the company greatly differed. The former favored open architecture computers like the Apple II, sold to education, small business, and home markets less vulnerable to IBM. Jobs wanted the company to focus on the closed architecture Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC. President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the Board Jobs' Macintosh division; it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies, duplicating services.[124] Although its products provided 85% of Apple's sales in early 1985, the company's January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or employees. This frustrated Wozniak, who left active employment at Apple in the spring of that year to pursue other ventures, stating that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\" and sold most of his stock.[125][126][127] Despite these grievances, Wozniak left the company amicably and as of January 2018 continues to represent Apple at events or in interviews,[126] receiving a stipend over the years for this role estimated in 2006 to be $120,000 per year.[128] Wozniak also remained an Apple shareholder following his departure.[129]\n\n\nWozniak's first venture after leaving Apple was founding CL 9 in 1985 and creating the first programmable universal remote control two years later, called the \"CORE\", stating that \"I never felt like I was turning my back on my own company [Apple].\" He told Apple's director of engineering Wayne Rosing about his decision to step away from the company, but not his longtime business partner and friend Steve Jobs. Wozniak guessed that Jobs first heard the news from an article in *The Wall Street Journal* where he mentioned that he wasn't leaving because he was disgruntled with Apple, but that he was excited to build a new remote control. The article nevertheless included some of Wozniak's criticisms of Apple, and Wozniak later said \"it was an accident, but it's been picked up by every book and every bit of history [since].\"[128]: 289\n\n\nIn April 1985, Sculley decided to remove Jobs as the general manager of the Macintosh division, and gained unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[130][121] Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple.[131] Informed by Jean-Louis Gassée, Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called an emergency executive meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.[131]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pixar headquarters in Emeryville, California\nJobs, while taking the position of Chairman of the firm, had no influence over Apple's direction and resigned in September 1985, taking a number of Apple employees with him to found NeXT Inc.[132] In a show of defiance at being set aside by Apple Computer, Jobs sold all but one of his 6.5 million shares in the company for $70 million. Jobs then acquired the visual effects house, Pixar for $5M (equivalent to $13,900,000 in 2023). NeXT Inc. built computers with futuristic designs and the UNIX-derived NEXTSTEP operating system. NeXTSTEP eventually developed into Mac OS X. While not a commercial success, due in part to its high price, the NeXT computer introduced important concepts to the history of the personal computer, including serving as the initial platform for Tim Berners-Lee as he was developing the World Wide Web.[133]\n\n\nSculley reorganized the company, unifying sales and marketing in one division and product operations and development in another.[134][124] Despite initial marketing difficulties, the Macintosh brand was eventually a success for Apple, due to its introduction of desktop publishing (and later computer animation) through Apple's partnership with Adobe Systems, which introduced the laser printer and Adobe PageMaker. The Macintosh became the default platform for many arts industries including cinema, music, advertising, and publishing.\n\n\n\n## 1985–1997: Sculley, Spindler, Amelio[edit]\n\n\n### Corporate performance[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple\n\n![](image)Macintosh SE (1987)\nUnder leadership of John Sculley, Apple issued its first corporate stock dividend on May 11, 1987. A month later on June 16, Apple stock split for the first time in a 2:1 split. Apple kept a quarterly dividend with about 0.3% yield until November 21, 1995.[*citation needed*] Between March 1988 and January 1989, Apple undertook five acquisitions, including software companies Network Innovations,[135] Styleware,[136] Nashoba Systems,[137] and Coral Software,[138] as well as satellite communications company Orion Network Systems.[139]\n\n\nApple continued to sell both lines of its computers, the Apple II and the Macintosh. A few months after introducing the Mac, Apple released a compact version of the Apple II called the Apple IIc. And in 1986 Apple introduced the Apple IIGS, an Apple II positioned as something of a hybrid product with a mouse-driven, Mac-like operating environment. Even with the release of the first Macintosh, Apple II computers remained the main source of income for Apple for years.[140]\n\n\n\n### The Mac family[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Macintosh models\n\n![](image)PowerBook 100 (1991)\nAt the same time, the Mac was becoming a product family of its own. The original model evolved into the Mac Plus in 1986 and spawned the Mac SE and the Mac II in 1987 and the Mac Classic and Mac LC in 1990. Meanwhile, Apple attempted its first portable Macs: the failed Macintosh Portable in 1989 and then the more popular PowerBook in 1991, a landmark product that established the modern form and ergonomic layout of the laptop. Popular products and increasing revenues made this a good time for Apple. MacAddict magazine has called 1989 to 1991 the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh.\n\n\nOn February 19, 1987, Apple registered the \"Apple.com\" domain name, making it one of the first hundred companies to register a .com address on the nascent Internet.[141]\n\n\n\n### Early-mid-1990s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Apple Newton MessagePad (1993)\nIn the late 1980s, Apple's fiercest technological rivals were the Amiga and Atari ST platforms. But computers based on the IBM PC were far more popular than all three, and by the 1990s, they finally had a comparable GUI thanks to Windows 3.0, and were out-competing Apple.\n\n\nApple's response to the PC threat was a profusion of new Macintosh lines including Quadra, Centris, and Performa. These new lines were marketed poorly by what was now \"arguably one of the worst-managed companies in the industry\".[142] There were too many models, differentiated by very minor graduations in technical specifications. The profusion of arbitrary model numbers confused consumers and hurt Apple's reputation for simplicity. Resellers like Sears and CompUSA often failed to sell or even competently display these Macs. Inventory grew as Apple consistently underestimated demand for popular models and overestimated demand for others.[142]\n\n\nIn 1991, Apple partnered with long-time competitor IBM and Motorola to form the AIM alliance, with the ultimate goal to create a revolutionary new computing platform, known as PReP, using IBM and Motorola hardware and Apple software. As the first step, Apple started the Power Macintosh line in 1994, using PowerPC processors from Motorola and IBM. The RISC architecture of these processors differed substantially from the Motorola 680X0 series used by previous Macs. Parts of Apple's operating system were rewritten to allow some older Mac software to run in emulation on the PowerPC series.[*citation needed*] Apple refused IBM's offer to purchase the company, but later unsuccessfully sought another offer from IBM,[143] and at one point was \"hours away\" from an acquisition by Sun Microsystems.[142][144]\n\n\nIn 1993, Apple released the Newton, an early personal digital assistant (PDA).\n\n\n\n### Need for a new OS[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

It was shut down in 1996.\n\n\nIn 1995, to achieve deeper market penetration and extra revenue, Apple officially began licensing the Mac OS and Macintosh ROMs to 3rd party manufacturers. The \"Clonintoshes\" competed with Apple's own Mac's and reduced Apple's sales. Apple had market share of over 10% until Jobs was re-hired in 1997 as interim CEO to replace Gil Amelio, and found a loophole to terminate the Macintosh OS licensing program. Macintosh's market share fell to around 3%.\n\n\nDuring the 90's, \"project *Pink*\" had Apple and IBM collaborating to develop a new operating system, named *Taligent* to replace *System 7*. Infighting resulted in Apple leaving the project and IBM finishing it. Apple started project *Copland*, but it was affected by Feature creep then Development hell due to software planned for Taligent being reworked for Copland. Ultimately Copland was scrapped.\n\n\nWith the Copland project in disarray, Apple decided it needed to acquire another company's operating system. Candidates considered were Sun's Solaris and Windows NT. Hancock was in favor of Solaris, while Amelio preferred Windows. Amelio called Bill Gates, and Gates promised Microsoft engineers would port QuickDraw to NT.[145]\n\n\n\n### Acquisition of NeXT[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(October 2021)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\nIn 1996, the struggling NeXT company beat Be Inc.'s BeOS bid to sell its operating system to Apple. On December 20, 1996, Apple announced it would purchase NeXT, and its NeXTstep operating system, for $429 million and 1.5 million shares of Apple stock. This brought Jobs back to Apple's management for the first time since 1985, and NeXT technology became the foundation of the Mac OS X operating system.\n\n\n## 1997–2001: Apple's comeback[edit]\n\n\n### Return of Steve Jobs[edit]\n\n\nOn July 9, 1997, Gil Amelio was ousted as CEO of Apple by the board of directors. Fred D. Anderson was the head of the directors in short term and obtained short-term working capital from the banks in July 1997.[146][147] In August 1997, Jobs stepped in as the interim CEO to begin a critical restructuring of the company's product line.[5] He eventually became CEO and served in that position from January 2000 to August 2011.[6] On August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned his position as chief executive officer of Apple before his long battle with pancreatic cancer took his life on October 5, 2011.[148]\n\n\nOn November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the Apple Store, an online retail store based upon the WebObjects application server the company had acquired in its purchase of NeXT. The new direct sales outlet was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing strategy.[149][150]\n\n\n\n### Microsoft deal[edit]\n\n\nAt the 1997 Macworld Expo, Jobs announced that Apple would begin a partnership with Microsoft, with terms including a five-year commitment from Microsoft to release Microsoft Office for Macintosh, and a US$150 million investment in Apple. The long-standing dispute over whether Windows infringed Apple patents was settled,[151] and Internet Explorer would ship as the Macintosh's default browser, with the user able to have a preference. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates appeared on-screen explaining plans for developing Mac software, and expressing excitement to be helping Apple return to success. Jobs addressed the audience:\n\n\n\n\n> If we want to move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again, we have to let go of a few things here. We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose. We have to embrace a notion that for Apple to win, Apple has to do a really good job. And if others are going to help us that's great, because we need all the help we can get, and if we screw up and we don't do a good job, it's not somebody else's fault, it's our fault. So I think that is a very important perspective. If we want Microsoft Office on the Mac, we better treat the company that puts it out with a little bit of gratitude; we'd like their software.\n> So, the era of setting this up as a competition between Apple and Microsoft is over as far as I'm concerned. This is about getting Apple healthy, this is about Apple being able to make incredibly great contributions to the industry and to get healthy and prosper again.[152]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe day before the announcement Apple had a market cap of $2.46 billion,[153] and had ended its previous quarter with quarterly revenues of US$1.7 billion and cash reserves of US$1.2 billion,[154] making the US$150 million amount of the investment largely symbolic. Apple CFO Fred Anderson stated that Apple would use the additional funds to invest in its core markets of education and creative content.[151]\n\n\n\n### iMac, iBook, and Power Mac G4[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The original iMac (iMac G3) released in 1998\nWhile discontinuing Apple's licensing of its operating system to third-party computer manufacturers, one of Jobs's first moves as new acting CEO was to develop the iMac, which bought Apple time to restructure. The original iMac integrated a CRT display and CPU into a streamlined, translucent plastic body. The line became a sales smash, moving about one million units each year. It helped re-introduce Apple to the media and public and announced the company's new emphasis on the design and aesthetics of its products.\n\n\nIn 1999, Apple introduced the Power Mac G4, which utilized the Motorola-made PowerPC 7400 containing a 128-bit instruction unit known as AltiVec, its flagship processor line. Apple unveiled the iBook that year, its first consumer-oriented laptop, the first Macintosh to support the use of Wireless LAN via the optional AirPort card. Based on the 802.11b standard, it helped popularize Wireless LAN technology to connect computers to networks.\n\n\n\n### Mac OS X[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac OS X\n\n![](image)Company headquarters on Infinite Loop in Cupertino, California\nIn 2001, Apple introduced Mac OS X, an operating system based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP and incorporating parts of the FreeBSD kernel.[155] Aimed at consumers and professionals alike, Mac OS X married the stability, reliability and security of Unix with the ease of a completely overhauled user interface. To help users transition, the new operating system allowed the use of Mac OS 9 applications through the Classic environment. Apple's Carbon API allowed developers to adapt Mac OS 9 software to use Mac OS X's features.\n\n\n\n### Retail stores[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple Store\n\nIn May 2001, after much speculation, Apple announced the opening of a line of Apple retail stores, to be located throughout the major U.S. computer buying markets. The stores were designed for two primary purposes: to stem the tide of Apple's declining share of the computer market and to respond to poor marketing of Apple products at third-party retail outlets.\n\n\n\n## 2001–2007: iPods, iTunes Store, Intel transition[edit]\n\n\n### iPod[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iPod\n\n![](image)A 1st-generation iPod (2001)\n![](image)iPod Mini with the UI (user interface) set to German\nIn October 2001, Apple introduced its first iPod portable digital audio player. Then iPod started as a 5 gigabyte player capable of storing around 1000 songs. Since then it has evolved into an array of products including the Mini (discontinued), the iPod Touch (discontinued), the Shuffle (discontinued), the iPod Classic (discontinued), the Nano (discontinued), the iPhone and the iPad. Since March 2011, the largest storage capacity for an iPod has been 160 gigabytes.[156] Speaking to software developers on June 6, 2005, Jobs said the company's share of the entire portable music device market stood at 76%.[157]\n\n\nThe iPod gave an enormous lift to Apple's financial results.[158] In the quarter ending March 26, 2005, Apple earned US$290 million, or 34¢ a share, on sales of US$3.24 billion. The year before in the same quarter, Apple earned just US$46 million, or 6¢ a share, on revenue of US$1.91 billion.\n\n\n\n### Moving on from colored plastics and the PowerPC G3[edit]\n\n\n![](image)iMac G4 (2002)\nIn early 2002, Apple unveiled a completely redesigned iMac, using the G4 processor and LCD display. The new iMac G4 design had a white hemispherical base and a flat panel all-digital display supported by a swiveling chrome neck. After several iterations increasing the processing speed and screen sizes from 15\" to 17\" to 20\" the iMac G4 was discontinued and replaced by the iMac G5 in the summer of 2004.\n\n\nLater in 2002, Apple released the Xserve 1U rack mounted server. Originally featuring two G4 chips, the Xserve was unusual for Apple in two ways. It represented an earnest effort to enter the enterprise computer market, and it was cheaper than competitors' similar machines. This was largely due to Fast ATA drives as opposed to the SCSI hard drives used in traditional rack-mounted servers. Apple later released the Xserve RAID, a 14 drive RAID that was again cheaper than competing systems.\n\n\nIn mid-2003, Jobs launched the Power Mac G5, based on IBM's G5 processor. Its all-metal anodized aluminum chassis finished Apple's transition away from colored plastics in their computers. Apple claims this was the first 64-bit computer sold to the general public. The Power Mac G5 was used by Virginia Tech to build its prototype System X supercomputing cluster, which at the time was considered the third-fastest supercomputer in the world. It cost only US$5.2 million to build, far less than the previous No. 3 and other ranking supercomputers. Apple's Xserves were updated to use the G5 as well. They replaced the Power Mac G5 machines as the main building block of Virginia Tech's System X, which was ranked in November 2004 as the world's seventh-fastest supercomputer.[159]\n\n\n\n![](image)iMac G5 (2004)\nA new iMac based on the G5 processor was unveiled August 31, 2004, and was made available in mid-September. This model dispensed with the base altogether, placing the CPU and the rest of the computing hardware behind the flat-panel screen, which is suspended from a streamlined aluminum foot. This new iMac, dubbed the iMac G5, was the \"world's thinnest desktop computer\",[160] measuring in at around two inches (around 5 centimeters).[161]\n\n\n2004 was a turning point for Apple. After creating a sizable financial base to work with, the company began experimenting with new parts from new suppliers. Apple could produce new designs quickly, and released the iPod Video, then the iPod Classic, and eventually the iPod touch and iPhone.\n\n\nOn April 29, 2005, Apple released Mac OS X v10.4 \"Tiger\".\n\n\nApple's successful PowerBook and iBook relied on previous generation G4 architecture produced by Freescale Semiconductor, a spin-off from Motorola. IBM engineers had some success in making their PowerPC G5 processor consume less power and run cooler, but not enough to run in iBook or PowerBook formats. In October 2005, Apple released the Power Mac G5 Dual featuring a Dual-Core processor – two cores in one rather than two separate processors. The Power Mac G5 Quad uses two Dual-Core processors. The Power Mac G5 Dual cores run individually at 2.0 GHz or 2.3 GHz. The Power Mac G5 Quad cores run individually at 2.5 GHz, and all variations have a graphics processor with 256-bit memory bandwidth.[162]\n\n\n\n### Retail store expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Apple Store in Ginza district, Tokyo\nInitially, Apple Stores were only in the United States, but in late 2003, Apple opened its first Apple Store abroad, in Tokyo's Ginza district. It was followed by a store in Osaka, Japan in August 2004. In 2005, Apple opened stores in Nagoya, the Shibuya district of Tokyo, Fukuoka, and Sendai. A store opened in Sapporo in 2006. Apple's first European store opened in London, on Regent Street, in November 2004. A store in the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham opened in April 2005, and the Bluewater shopping centre in Dartford, Kent opened in July 2005. Apple opened its first store in Canada in the middle of 2005 at the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in North York, Toronto. Later in 2005 Apple opened the Meadowhall Store in Sheffield and the Trafford Centre Store in Manchester, UK. Later additions in the London area include Brent Cross (January 2006), Westfield in Shepherd's Bush (September 2008), and Covent Garden (August 2010), which at 40,000 square feet (3,700 m2) was, as of 2015, the largest Apple Store in the world.[163]\n\n\nApple opened several \"mini\" stores in October 2004 to capture markets where demand does not necessarily dictate a full-scale store. The first of these stores was opened at Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto, California. These stores are only one half the square footage of the smallest normal store.\n\n\n\n### Apple and \"i\" Web services[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Apple introduced iTools, a set of free web-based tools that included an email account, internet greeting cards called iCards, a Web site review service called iReview, and \"KidSafe\", to prevent children browsing inappropriate websites. The latter two services were canceled because of lack of success. iCards and email were integrated into Apple's .Mac subscription-based service introduced in 2002 and discontinued in mid-2008 to make way for MobileMe, coinciding with the iPhone 3G release. MobileMe, at the same US$99.00 annual subscription as its dotMac predecessor, featured \"push\" services to instantly and automatically send emails, contacts and calendar updates directly to users' iPhones. Controversy around the release of MobileMe resulted in downtime and a significantly longer release window. Apple extended existing MobileMe subscriptions by 30 days free-of-charge.[164] At the WWDC event in June 2011, Apple announced iCloud, keeping most MobileMe services but dropping iDisk, Gallery, and iWeb. It added Find my Mac, iTunes Match, Photo Stream, Documents & Data Backup, and iCloud backup for iOS devices. The service requires iOS 5 and OS X 10.7 Lion.\n\n\n\n### iTunes Store[edit]\n\n\nMain article: iTunes Store\n\nThe iTunes Music Store was launched in April 2003, with 2 million downloads in the first 16 days. Music was purchased through the iTunes application, which was initially Macintosh-only; in October 2003, support for Windows was added. Initially, the music store was only available in the United States due to licensing restrictions.\n\n\nIn June 2004 Apple opened its iTunes Music Store in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. A version for the European Union version opened October 2004, but it was not initially available in the Republic of Ireland due to the intransigence of the Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA) but was opened there a few months later on Thursday, January 6, 2005. A version for Canada opened in December 2004. On May 10, 2005, the iTunes Music Store was expanded to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\n\nOn December 16, 2004, Apple sold its 200 millionth song on the iTunes Music Store to Ryan Alekman from Belchertown, Massachusetts. The download was *The Complete U2*, by U2.[165] Just under three months later Apple sold its 300 millionth song on March 2, 2005.[166] On July 17, 2005, the iTunes Music Store sold its 500 millionth song.[167] At that point, songs were selling at an accelerating annualized rate of more than 500 million.\n\n\nOn October 25, 2005, the iTunes Store went live in Australia, with songs selling for A$1.69 each, albums at (generally) A$16.99 and music videos and Pixar short films at A$3.39. Before the loophole was closed, people in New Zealand were briefly able to buy music from the Australian store\n\n\nOn February 23, 2006, the iTunes Music Store sold its 1 billionth song.[168]\n\n\nThe iTunes Music Store changed its name to iTunes Store on September 12, 2006, when it began offering video content (TV shows and movies) for sale. Since iTunes' inception, it has sold over 2 billion songs, 1.2 billion of which were sold in 2006. Since downloadable TV and movie content was added 50 million TV episodes and 1.3 million movies have been downloaded.\n\n\nIn early 2010, Apple celebrated the 10 billionth song downloaded from the iTunes Music Store.[169]\n\n\n\n### Intel transition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mac transition to Intel processors\n\n![](image)MacBook Pro Intel-based (2006)\nIn a keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would produce Intel-based Macintosh computers beginning in 2006.[170] Jobs confirmed rumors that the company had been secretly producing versions of Mac OS X for both PowerPC and Intel processors over the past 5 years, and that the transition to Intel processor systems would last until the end of 2007. Rumors of cross-platform compatibility had been spurred by the fact that Mac OS X is based on OPENSTEP, an operating system that was available for many platforms. Apple's own Darwin, the open source underpinnings of Mac OS X, was also available for Intel's x86 architecture.[171][172][173]\n\n\nOn January 10, 2006, the Intel-based iMac and MacBook Pro were introduced,[174][175] based on the Intel Core Duo platform. They came alongside news that Apple would complete the transition to Intel processors on all hardware by the end of 2006, a year ahead of the originally quoted schedule.\n\n\n\n## 2007–2011: Apple Inc., iPhone, iOS, iPad[edit]\n\n\nOn January 9, 2007, Apple Computer, Inc. shortened its name to simply Apple Inc. In his Macworld Expo keynote address, Jobs explained that with their current product mix consisting of the iPod and Apple TV as well as their Macintosh brand, Apple really wasn't just a computer company anymore. At the same address, Jobs revealed a product that would revolutionize an industry in which Apple had never previously competed: the Apple iPhone. The iPhone combined Apple's first widescreen iPod with the world's first mobile device boasting visual voicemail, and an internet communicator able to run a fully-functional version of Apple's web browser, Safari, on the then-named iPhone OS (later renamed iOS).\n\n\n\n### iOS evolution: iPhone and iPad[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: iOS, iPhone, and iPad\n\n![](image)The original iPhone (2007)\nThe first version of the iPhone became publicly available on June 29, 2007, in selected countries/markets. It was another 12 months before the iPhone 3G became available on July 11, 2008. Apple announced the iPhone 3GS on June 8, 2009, along with plans to release it later in June, July, and August, starting with the U.S., Canada, and major European countries on June 19. This 12-month iteration cycle has continued with the iPhone 4 model arriving in similar fashion in 2010, a Verizon model was released in February 2011, and a Sprint model in October 2011, shortly after Jobs' death.\n\n\nOn February 10, 2011, the iPhone 4 was made available on both Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Now two iPod types are multi-touch: the iPod nano and the iPod touch, a big advance in technology. Apple TV currently has a 2nd-generation model, which is 4 times smaller than the original Apple TV. Apple has also gone wireless, selling a wireless trackpad, keyboard, mouse, and external hard drive. Wired accessories are still available.\n\n\nThe Apple iPad was announced on January 27, 2010, with retail availability commencing in April and systematically growing in markets throughout 2010. The iPad fits into Apple's iOS product line, being twice the screen size of an iPhone without the phone abilities. While there were initial fears of product cannibalization the FY2010 financial results released in Jan 2011 included commentary of a reverse 'halo' effect, where iPad sales were leading to increased sales of iMacs and MacBooks.[176]\n\n\n\n### Resurgence compared to Microsoft[edit]\n\n\nSince 2005, Apple's revenues, profits, and stock price have grown significantly. On May 26, 2010, Apple's stock market value overtook Microsoft's,[177][178][179] and Apple's revenues surpassed those of Microsoft in the third quarter of 2010.[180][181] After giving their results for the first quarter of 2011, Microsoft's net profits of $5.2 billion were lower for the quarter than those of Apple, which earned $6 billion in net profit for the quarter.[182][183] The late April announcement of profits by the companies marked the first time in 20 years that Microsoft's profits had been lower than Apple's,[184] a situation described by *Ars Technica* as \"unimaginable a decade ago\".[182]\n\n\n*The Guardian* reported that one of the reasons for the change was because PC software, where Microsoft dominates, has become less important compared to the tablet and smartphone markets, where Apple has a strong presence.[184] One reason for this was a surprise drop in PC sales in the quarter.[184] Another issue for Microsoft was that its online search business had lost a lot of money, with a loss of $700 million in the first quarter of 2010.[184]\n\n\n\n## 2011–2020: Restructuring and Apple Watch[edit]\n\n\nOn March 2, 2011, Apple unveiled the iPad's second-generation model, the iPad 2. Like the 4th-generation iPod Touch and iPhone, the iPad 2 comes with a front-facing camera as well as a rear-facing camera, along with three new apps that utilize these new features: Camera, FaceTime, and Photo Booth.\n\n\nOn August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned from his position as CEO[185] with Tim Cook taking his place. On October 29, 2012, Apple announced structural changes to increase collaboration between hardware, software, and services.[186] This involved the departure of Scott Forstall, responsible for the launch of iOS (iPhone OS at the time of launch), who was replaced with Craig Federighi as head of iOS and OS X teams. Jony Ive became head of HI (Human Interface), whilst Eddy Cue was announced as head of online services including Siri and Maps. The most notable short term difference of this restructuring was the launch of iOS 7, the first version of the operating system to use a drastically different design to its predecessors, headed by Jony Ive,[187] followed by OS X Yosemite a year later with a similar design.\n\n\nDuring this time, Apple released the iPhone 5, the first iPhone to have a screen larger than 3.5\",[188] the iPod Touch 5 with a 4\" screen, the iPhone 5S with fingerprint scanning technology in the form of Touch ID, and iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, with screens at 4.7\" and 5.5\". They released the 3rd-generation iPad with Retina Display, followed by the 4th-generation iPad just half a year later. The iPad Mini was announced alongside the iPad 4th gen, and was the first to feature a smaller screen than 9.7\".

Apple released various major Mac updates, including the MacBook Pro with Retina Display,[189] whilst discontinuing the original MacBook range for a short period, before reintroducing it in 2015 with various new features, a Retina Display and a new design that implemented USB-C, while removing all other ports.[190] The Mac Pro and iMac were updated with more power and a drastically smaller and thinner profile.\n\n\nOn November 25, 2013, Apple acquired a company called PrimeSense.[191] On May 28, 2014, Apple acquired Beats Electronics, producers of the popular Beats by Dre headphone and speaker range, as well as streaming service Beats Music.\n\n\n\n![](image)Apple Watch first generation (2015)\nOn September 9, 2014, Apple announced the Apple Watch, the first new product range since the departure of Jobs.[192] The product cannot function beyond basic features without being within Bluetooth or WiFi range to an iPhone and contains basic applications (many acting as a remote for other devices, such as a music remote, or a control for an Apple TV) and fitness tracking. The Apple Watch received mixed reviews, with critics suggesting that whilst the device showed promise, it lacked a clear purpose, similar to many of the devices already on the market.[193] The Apple Watch was released on April 24, 2015.[194]\n\n\nOn September 9, 2015, Apple announced the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus with 3D Touch, the iPad Pro, and the fourth-generation Apple TV, along with the fourth-generation iPad Mini.\nOn March 21, 2016, Apple announced the first-generation iPhone SE and the smaller iPad Pro.\n\n\nOn September 7, 2016, Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with an improved camera and a faster processor than the previous generation.

Apple launched an iPhone 12 in purple and a GPS tracking device called AirTag that uses the Apple's Find My device network.\n\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Apple repeated its pattern of introducing four new iPhones in September, with 2021's iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro lines and 2022's iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro lines, with the iPhone 14 Pro ditching the notch containing the sensors for a \"dynamic island\" which allows for space between the top edge of the screen and the sensors for Face ID. 2022 saw Apple announce the first Macs with Apple's M2 chip and a new sub-series of Apple Watch with increased performance for outdoor activities named Apple Watch Ultra.\n\n\nApple launched a buy now, pay later service called 'Apple Pay Later' for its Apple Wallet users in March 2023.

It has been referred to as \"the most powerful company in the world\"[10] and as one of the world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the field of artificial intelligence.[11][12][13] Alongside Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta, and Microsoft, Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. is one of the five Big Tech companies.\n\n\nGoogle was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14]\n\n\nThe company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail), navigation (Waze & Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), video calling (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch & Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), artificial intelligence (Google Assistant & Bard), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.[15][16]\n\n\nGoogle's other ventures outside of Internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google Deepmind).[17]\n\n\nGoogle and YouTube are the two most visited websites worldwide followed by Facebook and X (formerly known as Twitter). Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite, video sharing platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, ML framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes[18] and fourth by Interbrand.[19] It has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse of its monopoly position.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Google and List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet\n\nSee also: Alphabet Inc.\n\n### Early years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2003\nGoogle began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California.[20][21][22] The project initially involved an unofficial \"third founder\", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[23][24] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.[25][26]\n\n\nWhile conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[27] They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[28][29] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.[23]\n\n\nPage and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine \"BackRub\", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.[20][30][31] Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeff Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project.[32] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.[33][34]\n\n\nEventually, they changed the name to *Google*; the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the word *googol*,[20][35][36] a very large number written **10100** (1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[37]\n\n\n\n![Google's homepage in 1998](image)Google's original homepage had a simple design because the company founders had little experience in HTML, the markup language used for designing web pages.[38]\nGoogle was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,[20] co-founder of Sun Microsystems. This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company to be able to use the funds.[39][40] Page and Brin initially approached David Cheriton for advice because he had a nearby office in Stanford, and they knew he had startup experience, having recently sold the company he co-founded, Granite Systems, to Cisco for $220 million. David arranged a meeting with Page and Brin and his Granite co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The meeting was set for 8 a.m. at the front porch of David's home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at Cisco, where he now worked after the acquisition, at 9 a.m. Andy briefly tested a demo of the website, liked what he saw, and then went back to his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also joined in with a $250,000 investment.[41][42]\n\n\nGoogle received money from two other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram.[43] Page and Brin had first approached Shriram, who was a venture capitalist, for funding and counsel, and Shriram invested $250,000 in Google in February 1998. Shriram knew Bezos because Amazon had acquired Junglee, at which Shriram was the president. It was Shriram who told Bezos about Google. Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google's founders and they met six months after Shriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area. Google's initial funding round had already formally closed but Bezos' status as CEO of Amazon was enough to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment.[44][45]\n\n\nBetween these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around $1,000,000, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California.[46]\nCraig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.[22][47][48]\n\n\nAfter some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[43] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[49] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.[40] Both firms were initially reticent about investing jointly in Google, as each wanted to retain a larger percentage of control over the company to themselves. Larry and Sergey however insisted in taking investments from both. Both venture companies finally agreed to investing jointly $12.5 million each due to their belief in Google's great potential and through the mediation of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in the venture companies.[50]\n\n\n\n### Growth[edit]\n\n\nIn March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,[51] which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.[52] The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.[53][22] To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[54] In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.[55][56]\n\n\n\n![Google's first servers, showing lots of exposed wiring and circuit boards](image)Google's first production server[57]\nIn 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California.[58] The complex became known as the Googleplex, a play on the word googolplex, the number one followed by a googol of zeroes. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million.[59] By that time, the name \"Google\" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb \"google\" to be added to the *Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary* and the *Oxford English Dictionary*, denoted as: \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet\".[60][61] The first use of the verb on television appeared in an October 2002 episode of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*.[62]\n\n\nAdditionally, in 2001 Google's investors felt the need to have a strong internal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the chairman and CEO of Google.[46] Eric was proposed by John Doerr from Kleiner Perkins. He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey and Larry would accept for several months, but they rejected several candidates because they wanted to retain control over the company. Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay back Sequoia's $12.5m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer, which had been made verbally during investment negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about joining Google either, as the company's full potential had not yet been widely recognized at the time, and as he was occupied with his responsibilities at Novell where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric agreed to buy $1 million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide funds Google needed.[63]\n\n\n\n### Initial public offering[edit]\n\n\nOn August 19, 2004, Google became a public company via an initial public offering. At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.[64] The company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[65][66] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[67][68] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[69]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011\nOn November 13, 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock,[70][71][72][73] On March 11, 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, transferring to Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies.[74][75]\n\n\nBy 2011, Google was handling approximately 3 billion searches per day. To handle this workload, Google built 11 data centers around the world with several thousand servers in each. These data centers allowed Google to handle the ever-changing workload more efficiently.[46]\n\n\nIn May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time.[76][77]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in its largest acquisition to date.[78][79][80] This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[81] mainly Apple and Microsoft,[82] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android.[83]\n\n\n\n### 2012 onward[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2013, Google acquired Waze, a $966 million deal.[84] While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable integrations between Waze and Google Maps, Google's own mapping service.[85]\n\n\nGoogle announced the launch of a new company, called Calico, on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple Inc. chairman Arthur Levinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the \"health and well-being\" company would focus on \"the challenge of ageing and associated diseases\".[86]\n\n\n\n![](image)Entrance of building where Google and its subsidiary Deep Mind are located at 6 Pancras Square, London\nOn January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquire DeepMind Technologies, a privately held artificial intelligence company from London.[87] Technology news website *Recode* reported that the company was purchased for $400 million, yet the source of the information was not disclosed. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the price.[88][89] The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google's recent growth in the artificial intelligence and robotics community.[90]/ In 2015, DeepMind's AlphaGo became the first computer program to defeat a top human pro at the game of Go.\n\n\nAccording to Interbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple Inc.) in 2013,[91] 2014,[92] 2015,[93] and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.[94]\n\n\nOn August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate named Alphabet Inc. Google became Alphabet's largest subsidiary and the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructuring, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.[95][96][97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Current Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, with Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi\nOn August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed a memo throughout the company that argued bias and \"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber\" clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions.[98] Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore of violating company policy by \"advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace\", and he was fired on the same day.[99][100][101]\n\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, tensions between the company's leadership and its workers escalated as staff protested company decisions on internal sexual harassment, Dragonfly, a censored Chinese search engine, and Project Maven, a military drone artificial intelligence, which had been seen as areas of revenue growth for the company.[102][103] On October 25, 2018, *The New York Times* published the *exposé*, \"How Google Protected Andy Rubin, the 'Father of Android'\". The company subsequently announced that \"48 employees have been fired over the last two years\" for sexual misconduct.[104] On November 1, 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-out to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment complaints.[105][106] CEO Sundar Pichai was reported to be in support of the protests.[107] Later in 2019, some workers accused the company of retaliating against internal activists.[103]\n\n\nOn March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market, launching a cloud gaming platform called Google Stadia.[108]\n\n\nOn June 3, 2019, the United States Department of Justice reported that it would investigate Google for antitrust violations.[109] This led to the filing of an antitrust lawsuit in October 2020, on the grounds the company had abused a monopoly position in the search and search advertising markets.[110]\n\n\nIn December 2019, former PayPal chief operating officer Bill Ready became Google's new commerce chief. Ready's role will not be directly involved with Google Pay.[111]\n\n\nIn April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google announced several cost-cutting measures. Such measures included slowing down hiring for the remainder of 2020, except for a small number of strategic areas, recalibrating the focus and pace of investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-business essential marketing and travel.[112] Most employees were also working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the success of it even led to Google announcing that they would be permanently converting some of their jobs to work from home [113]\n\n\nThe 2020 Google services outages disrupted Google services: one in August that affected Google Drive among others, another in November affecting YouTube, and a third in December affecting the entire suite of Google applications. All three outages were resolved within hours.[114][115][116]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union was founded, composed mostly of Google employees.[117]\n\n\nIn January 2021, the Australian Government proposed legislation that would require Google and Facebook to pay media companies for the right to use their content. In response, Google threatened to close off access to its search engine in Australia.[118]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Google reportedly paid $20 million for Ubisoft ports on Google Stadia.[119] Google spent \"tens of millions of dollars\" on getting major publishers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two to bring some of their biggest games to Stadia.[120]\n\n\nIn April 2021, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Google ran a years-long program called \"Project Bernanke\" that used data from past advertising bids to gain an advantage over competing for ad services. This was revealed in documents concerning the antitrust lawsuit filed by ten US states against Google in December.[121]\n\n\nIn September 2021, the Australian government announced plans to curb Google's capability to sell targeted ads, claiming that the company has a monopoly on the market harming publishers, advertisers, and consumers.[122]\n\n\nIn 2022, Google began accepting requests for the removal of phone numbers, physical addresses and email addresses from its search results. It had previously accepted requests for removing confidential data only, such as Social Security numbers, bank account and credit card numbers, personal signatures, and medical records. Even with the new policy, Google may remove information from only certain but not all search queries. It would not remove content that is \"broadly useful\", such as news articles, or already part of the public record.[123]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Google announced that the company had acquired California based, MicroLED display technology development and manufacturing Start-up Raxium. Raxium is set to join Google's Devices and Services team to aid in the development of micro-optics, monolithic integration, and system integration.[124][125]\n\n\nIn early 2023, following the success of ChatGPT and concerns that Google was falling behind in the AI race, Google's senior management issued a \"code red\" and a \"directive that all of its most important products—those with more than a billion users—must incorporate generative AI within months\".[126]\n\n\nIn early May 2023, Google announced its plans to build two additional data centers in Ohio. These centers, which will be built in Columbus and Lancaster, will power up the company’s tools, including AI technology. The said data hub will add to the already operational center near Columbus, bringing Google's total investment in Ohio to over $2 billion.[127]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Google products\n\n### Search engine[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Google Search and Google Images\n\nGoogle indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators.[128] According to comScore market research from November 2009, Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of 65.6%.[129] In May 2017, Google enabled a new \"Personal\" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from Google Photos.[130][131]\n\n\nGoogle launched its Google News service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles from various websites.[132] Google also hosts Google Books, a service which searches the text found in books in its database and shows limited previews or and the full book where allowed.[133]\n\n\nGoogle expanded its search services to include shopping (launched originally as Froogle in 2002),[134] finance (launched 2006),[135] and flights (launched 2011).[136]\n\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Google on ad-tech London, 2010\nGoogle generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on Google and YouTube, Android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Forty-six percent of this profit was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namely AdMob, AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.[137]\n\n\nIn addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology its acquisition of DoubleClick, to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history.[138][139]\n\n\nIn 2007, Google launched \"AdSense for Mobile\", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market.[140]\n\n\nGoogle Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.[141] Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google Ads allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.[142] The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.[143] One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.[144] Google Search Console (rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security issues of their websites, as well as optimize their website's visibility.\n\n\n\n### Consumer services[edit]\n\n\n#### Web-based services[edit]\n\n\nGoogle offers Gmail for email,[145] Google Calendar for time-management and scheduling,[146] Google Maps for mapping, navigation and satellite imagery,[147] Google Drive for cloud storage of files,[148] Google Docs, Sheets and Slides for productivity,[148] Google Photos for photo storage and sharing,[149] Google Keep for note-taking,[150] Google Translate for language translation,[151] YouTube for video viewing and sharing,[152] Google My Business for managing public business information,[153] and Duo for social interaction.[154] In March 2019, Google unveiled a cloud gaming service named Stadia.[108] A job search product has also existed since before 2017,[155][156][157] Google for Jobs is an enhanced search feature that aggregates listings from job boards and career sites.[158]\n\n\nSome Google services are not web-based. Google Earth, launched in 2005, allowed users to see high-definition satellite pictures from all over the world for free through a client software downloaded to their computers.[159]\n\n\n\n#### Software[edit]\n\n\nGoogle develops the Android mobile operating system,[160] as well as its smartwatch,[161] television,[162] car,[163] and Internet of things-enabled smart devices variations.[164]\n\n\nIt also develops the Google Chrome web browser,[165] and ChromeOS, an operating system based on Chrome.[166]\n\n\n\n#### Hardware[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Google Pixel smartphones on display in a store\nIn January 2010, Google released Nexus One, the first Android phone under its own brand.[167] It spawned a number of phones and tablets under the \"Nexus\" branding[168] until its eventual discontinuation in 2016, replaced by a new brand called Pixel.[169]\n\n\nIn 2011, the Chromebook was introduced, which runs on ChromeOS.[170]\n\n\nIn July 2013, Google introduced the Chromecast dongle, which allows users to stream content from their smartphones to televisions.[171][172]\n\n\nIn June 2014, Google announced Google Cardboard, a simple cardboard viewer that lets the user place their smartphone in a special front compartment to view virtual reality (VR) media.[173]\n\n\nOther hardware products include:\n\n\n\n* Nest, a series of voice assistant smart speakers that can answer voice queries, play music, find information from apps (calendar, weather etc.), and control third-party smart home appliances (users can tell it to turn on the lights, for example). The Google Nest line includes the original Google Home[174] (later succeeded by the Nest Audio), the Google Home Mini (later succeeded by the Nest Mini), the Google Home Max, the Google Home Hub (later rebranded as the Nest Hub), and the Nest Hub Max.\n* Nest Wifi (originally Google Wifi), a connected set of Wi-Fi routers to simplify and extend coverage of home Wi-Fi.[175]\n\n\n### Enterprise services[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform\n\nGoogle Workspace (formerly G Suite until October 2020[176]) is a monthly subscription offering for organizations and businesses to get access to a collection of Google's services, including Gmail, Google Drive and Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides, with additional administrative tools, unique domain names, and 24/7 support.[177]\n\n\nOn September 24, 2012,[178] Google launched Google for Entrepreneurs, a largely not-for-profit business incubator providing startups with co-working spaces known as Campuses, with assistance to startup founders that may include workshops, conferences, and mentorships.[179] Presently, there are seven Campus locations: Berlin, London, Madrid, Seoul, São Paulo, Tel Aviv, and Warsaw.\n\n\nOn March 15, 2016, Google announced the introduction of Google Analytics 360 Suite, \"a set of integrated data and marketing analytics products, designed specifically for the needs of enterprise-class marketers\" which can be integrated with BigQuery on the Google Cloud Platform. Among other things, the suite is designed to help \"enterprise class marketers\" \"see the complete customer journey\", generate \"useful insights\", and \"deliver engaging experiences to the right people\".[180] Jack Marshall of *The Wall Street Journal* wrote that the suite competes with existing marketing cloud offerings by companies including Adobe, Oracle, Salesforce, and IBM.[181]\n\n\n\n### Internet services[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2010, Google announced the Google Fiber project, with experimental plans to build an ultra-high-speed broadband network for 50,000 to 500,000 customers in one or more American cities.[182][183] Following Google's corporate restructure to make Alphabet Inc. its parent company, Google Fiber was moved to Alphabet's Access division.[184][185]\n\n\nIn April 2015, Google announced Project Fi, a mobile virtual network operator, that combines Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different telecommunication providers in an effort to enable seamless connectivity and fast Internet signal.[186][187]\n\n\n\n### Financial services[edit]\n\n\nAs a more mature company, Google has made many moves into financial services.\n\n\nIn August 2023, it became the first major tech company to join the OpenWallet Foundation, launched earlier in the year, whose goal was creating open-source software for interoperable digital wallets.[188]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n### Stock price performance and quarterly earnings[edit]\n\n\nGoogle's initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004. At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[65][66] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[69] The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,[189] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market.[190] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds.[190] GOOG shares split into GOOG class C shares and GOOGL class A shares.[191] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google's holding company, since the fourth quarter of 2015.[update][192]\n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profit, largely due to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.[193][194][195]\n\n\nFor the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only $112 million in licensing and other revenues.[196] In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs.[197]\n\n\nGoogle generated $50 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2012, generating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, \"We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half.\"[198]\n\n\nGoogle's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.[199] Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on advertisements.[200] By January 2014, Google's market capitalization had grown to $397 billion.[201]\n\n\n\n### Tax avoidance strategies[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland § Multinational tax schemes, and Google tax\n\nGoogle uses various tax avoidance strategies. On the list of largest technology companies by revenue, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through Ireland and the Netherlands and then to Bermuda. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in, for instance, the UK is 28 per cent.[202] This reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's transfer pricing practices in 2012.[203]\n\n\nIn 2020, Google said it had overhauled its controversial global tax structure and consolidated all of its intellectual property holdings back to the US.[204]\n\n\nGoogle Vice-president Matt Brittin testified to the Public Accounts Committee of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.[205] In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.[206] In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax bill.[207]\n\n\nIn 2013, Google ranked 5th in lobbying spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.[208]\n\n\n\n### Corporate identity[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of Google § Name, Google (verb), Google logo, Google Doodle, List of Google April Fools' Day jokes, and List of Google Easter eggs\n\n![](image)Google's logo from 2013 to 2015\nThe name \"Google\" originated from a misspelling of \"googol\",[209][210] which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original paper on PageRank:[32] \"We chose our system name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100[,] and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines.\" Having found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb \"google\" was added to the *Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary* and the *Oxford English Dictionary* in 2006, meaning \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.\"[211][212] Google's mission statement, from the outset, was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\",[213] and its unofficial slogan is \"Don't be evil\".[214] In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: \"Do the right thing\".[215] The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet.\n\n\nThe original Google logo was designed by Sergey Brin.[216] Since 1998,[update] Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays, events, achievements and people. The first Google Doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival of 1998.[217][218] The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed \"Doodlers\".[219]\n\n\nGoogle has a tradition of creating April Fools' Day jokes. Its first on April 1, 2000, was Google MentalPlex which allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.[220] In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called TiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a fiber-optic cable down their toilet.[221]\n\n\nGoogle's services contain easter eggs, such as the Swedish Chef's \"Bork bork bork,\" Pig Latin, \"Hacker\" or leetspeak, Elmer Fudd, Pirate, and Klingon as language selections for its search engine.[222] When searching for the word \"anagram,\" meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google's suggestion feature displays \"Did you mean: nag a ram?\"[223] Since 2019, Google runs free online courses to help engineers learn how to plan and author technical documentation better.[224]\n\n\n\n### Workplace culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Google employees marching in the Pride in London parade in 2016\nOn *Fortune* magazine's list of the best companies to work for, Google ranked first in 2007, 2008 and 2012,[225][226][227] and fourth in 2009 and 2010.[228][229] Google was also nominated in 2010 to be the world's most attractive employer to graduating students in the Universum Communications talent attraction index.[230] Google's corporate philosophy includes principles such as \"you can make money without doing evil,\" \"you can be serious without a suit,\" and \"work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun.\"[231]\n\n\nAs of September 30, 2020,[update] Alphabet Inc. had 132,121 employees,[232] of which more than 100,000 worked for Google.[8] Google's 2020[update] diversity report states that 32 percent of its workforce are women and 68 percent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being predominantly white (51.7%) and Asian (41.9%).[233] Within tech roles, 23.6 percent were women; and 26.7 percent of leadership roles were held by women.[234] In addition to its 100,000+ full-time employees, Google used about 121,000 temporary workers and contractors, as of March 2019.[update][8]\n\n\nGoogle's employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are split into six hierarchies based on experience and can range \"from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and experienced engineers at level six.\"[235] As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them. Some of Google's services, such as Gmail, Google News, Orkut, and AdSense originated from these independent endeavors.[236] In a talk at Stanford University, Marissa Mayer, Google's vice-president of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.[237]\n\n\nIn 2005, articles in *The New York Times*[238] and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy.[239][240][241] In an effort to maintain the company's unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer whose purpose was to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on.[242] Google has also faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees.[243][244] In 2013, a class action against several Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged \"no cold call\" agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[245] In a lawsuit filed January 8, 2018, multiple employees and job applicants alleged Google discriminated against a class defined by their \"conservative political views[,] male gender[,] and/or [...] Caucasian or Asian race\".[246]\n\n\nOn January 25, 2020, the formation of an international workers union of Google employees, Alpha Global, was announced.[247] The coalition is made up of \"13 different unions representing workers in 10 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Switzerland.\"[248] The group is affiliated with UNI Global Union, which represents nearly 20 million international workers from various unions and federations. The formation of the union is in response to persistent allegations of mistreatment of Google employees and a toxic workplace culture.[248][249][246] Google had previously been accused of surveilling and firing employees who were suspected of organizing a workers union.[250] In 2021 court documents revealed that between 2018 and 2020 Google ran an anti-union campaign called Project Vivian to \"convince them (employees) that unions suck\".[251]\n\n\n\n### Office locations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Googleplex\n\n![](image)Google's New York City office building houses its largest advertising sales team.\n![](image)Google's Toronto office\nGoogle's headquarters in Mountain View, California is referred to as \"the Googleplex\", a play on words on the number googolplex and the headquarters itself being a *complex* of buildings. Internationally, Google has over 78 offices in more than 50 countries.[252]\n\n\nIn 2006, Google moved into about 300,000 square feet (27,900 m2) of office space at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. The office was designed and built specially for Google, and houses its largest advertising sales team.[253] In 2010, Google bought the building housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the property at around $1.9 billion.[254][255] In March 2018, Google's parent company Alphabet bought the nearby Chelsea Market building for $2.4 billion. The sale is touted as one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in the history of New York.[256][257][258][259] In November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees.[260] The same December, it was announced that a $1 billion, 1,700,000-square-foot (160,000 m2) headquarters for Google would be built in Manhattan's Hudson Square neighborhood.[261][262] Called Google Hudson Square, the new campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York City.[263]\n\n\nBy late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[264] In November 2006, Google opened offices on Carnegie Mellon's campus in Pittsburgh, focusing on shopping-related advertisement coding and smartphone applications and programs.[265][266] Other office locations in the U.S. include Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Boulder, Colorado; Cambridge, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Kirkland, Washington; Birmingham, Michigan; Reston, Virginia, Washington, D.C.,[267] and Madison, Wisconsin.[268]\n\n\n\n![](image)Google's Dublin Ireland office, headquarters of Google Ads for Europe\nIt also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namely Sydney (birthplace location of Google Maps)[269] and London (part of Android development).[270] In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new London headquarter, a 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal's announcement in January,[271] Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to the Camden Council in June 2017.[272][273] In May 2015, Google announced its intention to create its own campus in Hyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the company's largest outside the United States, will accommodate 13,000 employees.[274][275]\n\n\nGoogle's Global Offices sum a total of 85 Locations worldwide,[276] with 32 offices in North America, 3 of them in Canada and 29 in United States Territory, California being the state with the most Google's offices with 9 in total including the Googleplex. In the Latin America Region Google counts with 6 offices, in Europe 24 (3 of them in UK), the Asia Pacific region counts with 18 offices principally 4 in India and 3 in China, and the Africa Middle East region counts 5 offices.\n\n\n\n#### North America[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country or US State\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Ann Arbor | ![](image) Michigan |\n| 2. | Atlanta | ![](image) Georgia |\n| 3. | Austin | ![](image) Texas |\n| 4. | Boulder | ![](image) Colorado |\n| 5. | Boulder – Pearl Place | ![](image) Colorado |\n| 6. | Boulder – Walnut | ![](image) Colorado |\n| 7. | Cambridge | ![](image) Massachusetts |\n| 8. | Chapel Hill | ![](image) North Carolina |\n| 9. | Chicago – Carpenter | ![](image) Illinois |\n| 10. | Chicago – Fulton Market | ![](image) Illinois |\n| 11. | Detroit | ![](image) Michigan |\n| 12. | Irvine | ![](image) California |\n| 13. | Kirkland | ![](image) Washington |\n| 14. | Kitchener | ![](image) Canada |\n| 15. | Los Angeles | ![](image) California |\n| 16. | Madison | ![](image) Wisconsin |\n| 17. | Miami | ![](image) Florida |\n| 18. | Montreal | ![](image) Canada |\n| 19. | Mountain View | ![](image) California |\n| 20. | New York | ![](image) New York |\n| 21. | Pittsburgh | ![](image) Pennsylvania |\n| 22. | Playa Vista | ![](image) California |\n| 23. | Portland | ![](image) Oregon |\n| 24. | Redwood City | ![](image) California |\n| 25. | Reston | ![](image) Virginia |\n| 26. | San Bruno | ![](image) California |\n| 27. | San Diego | ![](image) California |\n| 28. | San Francisco – **HQ** | ![](image) California |\n| 29. | Seattle | ![](image) Washington |\n| 30. | Sunnyvale | ![](image) California |\n| 31. | Toronto | ![](image) Canada |\n| 32. | Washington DC | ![](image) District of Columbia |\n\n\n#### Latin America[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Belo Horizonte | ![](image) Brazil |\n| 2. | Bogotá | ![](image) Colombia |\n| 3. | Buenos Aires | ![](image) Argentina |\n| 4. | Mexico City | ![](image) Mexico |\n| 5. | Santiago de Chile | ![](image) Chile |\n| 6. | São Paulo | ![](image) Brazil |\n\n\n#### Europe[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Aarhus | ![](image) Denmark |\n| 2. | Amsterdam | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| 3. | Athens | ![](image) Greece |\n| 4. | Berlin | ![](image) Germany |\n| 5. | Brussels | ![](image) Belgium |\n| 6. | Copenhagen | ![](image) Denmark |\n| 7. | Dublin | ![](image) Ireland |\n| 8. | Hamburg | ![](image) Germany |\n| 9. | Lisbon | ![](image) Portugal |\n| 10. | London – 6PS | ![](image) United Kingdom |\n| 11. | London – BEL | ![](image) United Kingdom |\n| 12. | London – CSG | ![](image) United Kingdom |\n| 13. | Madrid | ![](image) Spain |\n| 14. | Milan | ![](image) Italy |\n| 15. | Moscow | ![](image) Russia |\n| 16. | Munich | ![](image) Germany |\n| 17. | Oslo | ![](image) Norway |\n| 18. | Paris | ![](image) France |\n| 19. | Prague | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| 20. | Stockholm | ![](image) Sweden |\n| 21. | Vienna | ![](image) Austria |\n| 22. | Warsaw | ![](image) Poland |\n| 23. | Wroclaw | ![](image) Poland |\n| 24. | Zurich – BRA | ![](image) Switzerland |\n| 25. | Zurich – EUR | ![](image) Switzerland |\n\n\n#### Asia-Pacific[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Auckland | ![](image) New Zealand |\n| 2. | Bangalore | ![](image) India |\n| 3. | Bangkok | ![](image) Thailand |\n| 4. | Beijing | ![](image) China |\n| 5. | Guangzhou | ![](image) China |\n| 6. | Gurgaon | ![](image) India |\n| 7. | Hong Kong | ![](image) Hong Kong |\n| 8. | Hyderabad | ![](image) India |\n| 9. | Jakarta | ![](image) Indonesia |\n| 10. | Kuala Lumpur | ![](image) Malaysia |\n| 11. | Manila | ![](image) Philippines |\n| 12. | Melbourne | ![](image) Australia |\n| 13. | Mumbai | ![](image) India |\n| 14. | Seoul | ![](image) South Korea |\n| 15. | Shanghai | ![](image) China |\n| 16. | Singapore | ![](image) Singapore |\n| 17. | Sydney | ![](image) Australia |\n| 18. | Taipei | ![](image) Taiwan |\n| 19. | Tokyo – RPG | ![](image) Japan |\n| 20. | Tokyo – STRM | ![](image) Japan |\n\n\n#### Africa and the Middle East[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Dubai | ![](image) United Arab Emirates |\n| 2. | Haifa | ![](image) Israel |\n| 3. | Istanbul | ![](image) Turkey |\n| 4. | Johannesburg | ![](image) South Africa |\n| 5. | Tel Aviv | ![](image) Israel |\n\n\n### Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Google data centers\n\nGoogle has data centers in North and South America, Asia, and Europe.[277] There is no official data on the number of servers in Google data centers; however, research and advisory firm Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers.[278] Traditionally, Google relied on parallel computing on commodity hardware like mainstream x86 computers (similar to home PCs) to keep costs per query low.[279][280][281] In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only revealed in 2009.[281]\n\n\nGoogle has built its own private submarine communications cables. The first cable, named Curie, connects California with Chile and was completed on November 15, 2019.[282][283] The second fully Google-owned undersea cable, named Dunant, connects the United States with France and is planned to begin operation in 2020.[284] Google's third subsea cable, Equiano, will connect Lisbon, Portugal with Lagos, Nigeria and Cape Town, South Africa.[285] The company's fourth cable, named Grace Hopper, connects landing points in New York, US, Bude, UK and Bilbao, Spain, and is expected to become operational in 2022.[286]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of solar panels to provide up to 1.6 Megawatt of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus' energy needs.[287][288] The system is the largest rooftop photovoltaic power station constructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world.[287] Since 2007,[update] Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.[289]\n\n\nGoogle disclosed in September 2011 that it \"continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes\", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.[290]\n\n\nIn 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8 million into two wind farms in North Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes.[291] In February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.[292] The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.[293]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of power for 20 years.[294]\n\n\nIn December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it would purchase enough renewable energy to match 100% of the energy usage of its data centers and offices. The commitment will make Google \"the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy\".[295][296][297]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma.[298] In September 2019, Google's chief executive announced plans for a $2 billion wind and solar investment, the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. This will grow their green energy profile by 40%, giving them an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean energy, the company said.[299]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Google announced it had retroactively offset all of its carbon emissions since the company's foundation in 1998.[300] It also committed to operating its data centers and offices using only carbon-free energy by 2030.[301] In October 2020, the company pledged to make the packaging for its hardware products 100% plastic-free and 100% recyclable by 2025. It also said that all its final assembly manufacturing sites will achieve a UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification by 2022 by ensuring that the vast majority of waste from the manufacturing process is recycled instead of ending up in a landfill.[302]\n\n\n\n#### Climate change denial and misinformation[edit]\n\n\nGoogle donates to climate change denial political groups including the State Policy Network and the Competitive Enterprise Institute.[303][304] The company also actively funds and profits from climate disinformation by monetizing ad spaces on most of the largest climate disinformation sites.[305] Google continued to monetize and profit from sites propagating climate disinformation even after the company updated their policy to prohibit placing their ads on similar sites.[306]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Google.org\n\nIn 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic Google.org, with a start-up fund of $1 billion.[307] The mission of the organization is to create awareness about climate change, global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired Larry Brilliant as the program's executive director in 2004[308] and Megan Smith has since[update] replaced him as director.[309]\n\n\nIn March 2007, in partnership with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), Google hosted the first Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at its headquarters in Mountain View.[310] In 2011, Google donated 1 million euros to International Mathematical Olympiad to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).[311][312] In July 2012, Google launched a \"Legalize Love\" campaign in support of gay rights.[313]\n\n\nIn 2008, Google announced its \"project 10100\" which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.[314] After two years of silence, during which many wondered what had happened to the program,[315] Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.[316]\n\n\nResponding to the humanitarian crisis after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Google announced a $15 million donation to support Ukrainian citizens.[317] The company also decided to transform its office in Warsaw into a help center for refugees.[318]\n\n\nAlso in February 2022, Google announced a $100 million fund to expand skills training and job placement for low-income Americans, in conjunction with non-profits Year Up, Social Finance, and Merit America.[319]\n\n\n\n## Criticism and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Criticism of Google, Censorship by Google, and Privacy concerns regarding Google\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of Criticism of Google.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this article's main text. *(April 2019)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)San Francisco activists protest privately owned shuttle buses that transport workers for tech companies such as Google from their homes in San Francisco and Oakland to corporate campuses in Silicon Valley.\nGoogle has had criticism over issues such as aggressive tax avoidance,[320] search neutrality, copyright, censorship of search results and content,[321] and privacy.[322][323]\n\n\nOther criticisms are alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of other people's intellectual property, concerns that its compilation of data may violate people's privacy, and the energy consumption of its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such as monopoly, restraint of trade, anti-competitive practices, and patent infringement.\n\n\nGoogle formerly complied with Internet censorship policies of the People's Republic of China,[324] enforced by means of filters colloquially known as \"The Great Firewall of China\", but no longer does so. As a result, all Google services except for Chinese Google Maps are blocked from access within mainland China without the aid of virtual private networks, proxy servers, or other similar technologies.\n\n\n\n### 2018[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Mozilla program manager Chris Peterson accused Google of intentionally slowing down YouTube performance on Firefox.[325][326]\n\n\nIn August 2018, The Intercept reported that Google is developing for the People's Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as Dragonfly) \"that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest\".[327][328] However, the project had been withheld due to privacy concerns.[329][330]\n\n\n\n### 2019[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, a hub for critics of Google dedicated to abstaining from using Google products coalesced in the Reddit online community /r/degoogle.[331] The DeGoogle grassroots campaign continues to grow as privacy activists highlight information about Google products, and the associated incursion on personal privacy rights by the company.\n\n\nIn April 2019, former Mozilla executive Jonathan Nightingale accused Google of intentionally and systematically sabotaging the Firefox browser over the past decade in order to boost adoption of Google Chrome.[332]\n\n\nIn November 2019, the Office for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human Services began investigation into Project Nightingale, to assess whether the \"mass collection of individuals' medical records\" complied with HIPAA.[333] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, Google secretively began the project in 2018, with St. Louis-based healthcare company Ascension.[334]\n\n\n\n### 2022[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2022 National Labor Relations Board ruling, court documents suggested that Google sponsored a secretive project—*Project Vivian*—to counsel its employees and to discourage them from forming unions.[335]\n\n\n\n### 2023[edit]\n\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Google placed an ad against anti-disinformation Brazilian Congressional Bill No. 2630, which was about to be approved, on its search homepage in Brazil, calling on its users to ask congressional representatives to oppose the legislation. The country's government and judiciary accused the company of undue interference in the congressional debate, saying it could amount to abuse of economic power and ordering the company to change the ad within two hours of notification or face fines of R$1 million (2023) (US$185,528.76) per non-compliance hour. The company then promptly removed the ad.[336][337]\n\n\n\n### Racially-targeted surveillance[edit]\n\n\nGoogle has aided controversial governments in mass surveillance projects, sharing with police and military the identities of those protesting racial injustice. In 2020, they shared with the FBI information collected from all Android users at a Black Lives Matter protest in Seattle,[338] including those who had opted out of location data collection.[339][340]\n\n\nGoogle is also part of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion deal in which the technology companies Google and Amazon will provide Israel and its military with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cloud computing services, including building local cloud sites that will \"keep information within Israel's borders under strict security guidelines.\"[341][342][343] The contract has been criticized by shareholders as well as their employees over concerns that the project will lead to further abuses of Palestinians' human rights in the context of the ongoing illegal occupation and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[344][345] Ariel Koren, a former marketing manager for Google's educational products and an outspoken critic of the project, wrote that Google \"systematically silences Palestinian, Jewish, Arab and Muslim voices concerned about Google's complicity in violations of Palestinian human rights—to the point of formally retaliating against workers and creating an environment of fear,\" reflecting her view that the ultimatum came in retaliation for her opposition to and organization against the project.[341][346]\n\n\n\n### Anti-trust, privacy, and other litigation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Google litigation\n\n![](image)The European Commission, which imposed three fines on Google in 2017, 2018, and 2019\n#### Fines and lawsuits[edit]\n\n\n##### European Union[edit]\n\n\nOn June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of €2.42 billion from the European Union for \"promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results.\"[347]\n\n\nOn July 18, 2018,[348] the European Commission fined Google €4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The abuse of dominant position has been referred to Google's constraint applied to Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed[349] that it had appealed the fine to the General Court of the European Union.[350]\n\n\nOn October 8, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to \"non-public\" Google+ account data being exposed as a result of a bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the private information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to claimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each.[351][352][353]\n\n\nOn March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a €1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for preventing rivals from being able to \"compete and innovate fairly\" in the online advertising market. European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust rules by \"imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites\" that required them to exclude search results from Google's rivals.[354][355]\n\n\nOn September 14, 2022, Google lost the appeal over €4.125bn (£3.5bn) fine, which was ruled to be paid after it was proved by the European Commission that Google forced Android phone-makers to carry Google's search and web browser apps. Since the initial accusations, Google changed its policy.[356]\n\n\n\n##### France[edit]\n\n\nOn January 21, 2019, French data regulator CNIL imposed a record €50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google issued a statement saying it was \"deeply committed\" to transparency and was \"studying the decision\" before determining its response.[357]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2022, France's data privacy regulatory body CNIL fined Alphabet's Google 150 million euros (US$169 million) for not allowing its Internet users an easy refusal of Cookies along with Facebook.[358]\n\n\n\n##### United States[edit]\n\n\nAfter U.S. Congressional hearings in July 2020,[359] and a report from the U.S. House of Representatives' Antitrust Subcommittee released in early October[360] the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google on October 20, 2020, asserting that it has illegally maintained its monopoly position in web search and search advertising.[361][362] The lawsuit alleged that Google engaged in anticompetitive behavior by paying Apple between $8 billion-$12 billion to be the default search engine on iPhones.[363] Later that month, both Facebook and Alphabet agreed to \"cooperate and assist one another\" in the face of investigation into their online advertising practices.[364][365] Another suit was brought against Google in 2023 for illegally monopolizing the advertising technology market.[366]\n\n\n\n#### Private browsing lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Private browsing\n\nIn early June 2020, a $5 billion class-action lawsuit was filed against Google by a group of consumers, alleging that Chrome's Incognito browsing mode still collects their user history.[367][368] The lawsuit became known in March 2021 when a federal judge denied Google's request to dismiss the case, ruling that they must face the group's charges.[369][370] Reuters reported that the lawsuit alleged that Google's CEO Sundar Pichai sought to keep the users unaware of this issue.[371]\n\n\n\n#### Gender discrimination lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, three women sued Google, accusing the company of violating California's Equal Pay Act by underpaying its female employees. The lawsuit cited the wage gap was around $17,000 and that Google locked women into lower career tracks, leading to smaller salaries and bonuses. In June 2022, Google agreed to pay a $118 million settlement to 15,550 female employees working in California since 2013. As a part of the settlement, Google also agreed to hire a third party to analyze its hiring and compensation practices.[372][373][374]\n\n\n\n#### U.S. government contracts[edit]\n\n\nFollowing media reports about PRISM, the NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.[375] According to unnamed sources, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009, as YouTube in 2010.[376]\n\n\nGoogle has worked with the United States Department of Defense on drone software through the 2017 Project Maven that could be used to improve the accuracy of drone strikes.[377] In April 2018, thousands of Google employees, including senior engineers, signed a letter urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to end this controversial contract with the Pentagon.[378] Google ultimately decided not to renew this DoD contract, which was set to expire in 2019.[379]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Google\n* History of Google\n* List of Google products\n* Google China\n* Google logo\n* Googlization\n* Google.org\n* Google ATAP\n* List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Google was incorporated on September 4, 1998, however, since 2002, the company has celebrated its anniversaries on various days in September, most frequently on September 27.[1][2][3] The shift in dates reportedly happened to celebrate index-size milestones in tandem with the birthday.[4]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Fitzpatrick, Alex (September 4, 2014). \"Google Used to Be the Company That Did 'Nothing But Search'\". *Time*.\n2. **^** \"When is Google's birthday – and why are people confused?\". *The Telegraph*.

It has been referred to as \"the most powerful company in the world\"[10] and as one of the world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the field of artificial intelligence.[11][12][13] Alongside Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta, and Microsoft, Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. is one of the five Big Tech companies.\n\n\nGoogle was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14]\n\n\nThe company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail), navigation (Waze & Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), video calling (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch & Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), artificial intelligence (Google Assistant & Bard), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.[15][16]\n\n\nGoogle's other ventures outside of Internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google Deepmind).[17]\n\n\nGoogle and YouTube are the two most visited websites worldwide followed by Facebook and X (formerly known as Twitter). Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite, video sharing platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, ML framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes[18] and fourth by Interbrand.[19] It has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse of its monopoly position.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Google and List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet\n\nSee also: Alphabet Inc.\n\n### Early years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2003\nGoogle began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California.[20][21][22] The project initially involved an unofficial \"third founder\", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[23][24] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.[25][26]\n\n\nWhile conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[27] They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[28][29] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.[23]\n\n\nPage and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine \"BackRub\", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.[20][30][31] Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeff Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project.[32] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.[33][34]\n\n\nEventually, they changed the name to *Google*; the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the word *googol*,[20][35][36] a very large number written **10100** (1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[37]\n\n\n\n![Google's homepage in 1998](image)Google's original homepage had a simple design because the company founders had little experience in HTML, the markup language used for designing web pages.[38]\nGoogle was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,[20] co-founder of Sun Microsystems. This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company to be able to use the funds.[39][40] Page and Brin initially approached David Cheriton for advice because he had a nearby office in Stanford, and they knew he had startup experience, having recently sold the company he co-founded, Granite Systems, to Cisco for $220 million. David arranged a meeting with Page and Brin and his Granite co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The meeting was set for 8 a.m. at the front porch of David's home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at Cisco, where he now worked after the acquisition, at 9 a.m. Andy briefly tested a demo of the website, liked what he saw, and then went back to his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also joined in with a $250,000 investment.[41][42]\n\n\nGoogle received money from two other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram.[43] Page and Brin had first approached Shriram, who was a venture capitalist, for funding and counsel, and Shriram invested $250,000 in Google in February 1998. Shriram knew Bezos because Amazon had acquired Junglee, at which Shriram was the president. It was Shriram who told Bezos about Google. Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google's founders and they met six months after Shriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area. Google's initial funding round had already formally closed but Bezos' status as CEO of Amazon was enough to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment.[44][45]\n\n\nBetween these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around $1,000,000, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California.[46]\nCraig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.[22][47][48]\n\n\nAfter some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[43] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[49] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.[40] Both firms were initially reticent about investing jointly in Google, as each wanted to retain a larger percentage of control over the company to themselves. Larry and Sergey however insisted in taking investments from both. Both venture companies finally agreed to investing jointly $12.5 million each due to their belief in Google's great potential and through the mediation of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in the venture companies.[50]\n\n\n\n### Growth[edit]\n\n\nIn March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,[51] which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.[52] The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.[53][22] To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[54] In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.[55][56]\n\n\n\n![Google's first servers, showing lots of exposed wiring and circuit boards](image)Google's first production server[57]\nIn 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California.[58] The complex became known as the Googleplex, a play on the word googolplex, the number one followed by a googol of zeroes. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million.[59] By that time, the name \"Google\" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb \"google\" to be added to the *Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary* and the *Oxford English Dictionary*, denoted as: \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet\".[60][61] The first use of the verb on television appeared in an October 2002 episode of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*.[62]\n\n\nAdditionally, in 2001 Google's investors felt the need to have a strong internal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the chairman and CEO of Google.[46] Eric was proposed by John Doerr from Kleiner Perkins. He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey and Larry would accept for several months, but they rejected several candidates because they wanted to retain control over the company. Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay back Sequoia's $12.5m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer, which had been made verbally during investment negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about joining Google either, as the company's full potential had not yet been widely recognized at the time, and as he was occupied with his responsibilities at Novell where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric agreed to buy $1 million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide funds Google needed.[63]\n\n\n\n### Initial public offering[edit]\n\n\nOn August 19, 2004, Google became a public company via an initial public offering. At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.[64] The company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[65][66] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[67][68] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[69]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011\nOn November 13, 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock,[70][71][72][73] On March 11, 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, transferring to Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies.[74][75]\n\n\nBy 2011, Google was handling approximately 3 billion searches per day. To handle this workload, Google built 11 data centers around the world with several thousand servers in each. These data centers allowed Google to handle the ever-changing workload more efficiently.[46]\n\n\nIn May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time.[76][77]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in its largest acquisition to date.[78][79][80] This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[81] mainly Apple and Microsoft,[82] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android.[83]\n\n\n\n### 2012 onward[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2013, Google acquired Waze, a $966 million deal.[84] While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable integrations between Waze and Google Maps, Google's own mapping service.[85]\n\n\nGoogle announced the launch of a new company, called Calico, on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple Inc. chairman Arthur Levinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the \"health and well-being\" company would focus on \"the challenge of ageing and associated diseases\".[86]\n\n\n\n![](image)Entrance of building where Google and its subsidiary Deep Mind are located at 6 Pancras Square, London\nOn January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquire DeepMind Technologies, a privately held artificial intelligence company from London.[87] Technology news website *Recode* reported that the company was purchased for $400 million, yet the source of the information was not disclosed. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the price.[88][89] The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google's recent growth in the artificial intelligence and robotics community.[90]/ In 2015, DeepMind's AlphaGo became the first computer program to defeat a top human pro at the game of Go.\n\n\nAccording to Interbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple Inc.) in 2013,[91] 2014,[92] 2015,[93] and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.[94]\n\n\nOn August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate named Alphabet Inc. Google became Alphabet's largest subsidiary and the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructuring, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.[95][96][97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Current Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, with Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi\nOn August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed a memo throughout the company that argued bias and \"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber\" clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions.[98] Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore of violating company policy by \"advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace\", and he was fired on the same day.[99][100][101]\n\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, tensions between the company's leadership and its workers escalated as staff protested company decisions on internal sexual harassment, Dragonfly, a censored Chinese search engine, and Project Maven, a military drone artificial intelligence, which had been seen as areas of revenue growth for the company.[102][103] On October 25, 2018, *The New York Times* published the *exposé*, \"How Google Protected Andy Rubin, the 'Father of Android'\". The company subsequently announced that \"48 employees have been fired over the last two years\" for sexual misconduct.[104] On November 1, 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-out to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment complaints.[105][106] CEO Sundar Pichai was reported to be in support of the protests.[107] Later in 2019, some workers accused the company of retaliating against internal activists.[103]\n\n\nOn March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market, launching a cloud gaming platform called Google Stadia.[108]\n\n\nOn June 3, 2019, the United States Department of Justice reported that it would investigate Google for antitrust violations.[109] This led to the filing of an antitrust lawsuit in October 2020, on the grounds the company had abused a monopoly position in the search and search advertising markets.[110]\n\n\nIn December 2019, former PayPal chief operating officer Bill Ready became Google's new commerce chief. Ready's role will not be directly involved with Google Pay.[111]\n\n\nIn April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google announced several cost-cutting measures. Such measures included slowing down hiring for the remainder of 2020, except for a small number of strategic areas, recalibrating the focus and pace of investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-business essential marketing and travel.[112] Most employees were also working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the success of it even led to Google announcing that they would be permanently converting some of their jobs to work from home [113]\n\n\nThe 2020 Google services outages disrupted Google services: one in August that affected Google Drive among others, another in November affecting YouTube, and a third in December affecting the entire suite of Google applications. All three outages were resolved within hours.[114][115][116]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union was founded, composed mostly of Google employees.[117]\n\n\nIn January 2021, the Australian Government proposed legislation that would require Google and Facebook to pay media companies for the right to use their content. In response, Google threatened to close off access to its search engine in Australia.[118]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Google reportedly paid $20 million for Ubisoft ports on Google Stadia.[119] Google spent \"tens of millions of dollars\" on getting major publishers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two to bring some of their biggest games to Stadia.[120]\n\n\nIn April 2021, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Google ran a years-long program called \"Project Bernanke\" that used data from past advertising bids to gain an advantage over competing for ad services. This was revealed in documents concerning the antitrust lawsuit filed by ten US states against Google in December.[121]\n\n\nIn September 2021, the Australian government announced plans to curb Google's capability to sell targeted ads, claiming that the company has a monopoly on the market harming publishers, advertisers, and consumers.[122]\n\n\nIn 2022, Google began accepting requests for the removal of phone numbers, physical addresses and email addresses from its search results. It had previously accepted requests for removing confidential data only, such as Social Security numbers, bank account and credit card numbers, personal signatures, and medical records. Even with the new policy, Google may remove information from only certain but not all search queries. It would not remove content that is \"broadly useful\", such as news articles, or already part of the public record.[123]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Google announced that the company had acquired California based, MicroLED display technology development and manufacturing Start-up Raxium. Raxium is set to join Google's Devices and Services team to aid in the development of micro-optics, monolithic integration, and system integration.[124][125]\n\n\nIn early 2023, following the success of ChatGPT and concerns that Google was falling behind in the AI race, Google's senior management issued a \"code red\" and a \"directive that all of its most important products—those with more than a billion users—must incorporate generative AI within months\".[126]\n\n\nIn early May 2023, Google announced its plans to build two additional data centers in Ohio. These centers, which will be built in Columbus and Lancaster, will power up the company’s tools, including AI technology. The said data hub will add to the already operational center near Columbus, bringing Google's total investment in Ohio to over $2 billion.[127]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Google products\n\n### Search engine[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Google Search and Google Images\n\nGoogle indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators.[128] According to comScore market research from November 2009, Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of 65.6%.[129] In May 2017, Google enabled a new \"Personal\" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from Google Photos.[130][131]\n\n\nGoogle launched its Google News service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles from various websites.[132] Google also hosts Google Books, a service which searches the text found in books in its database and shows limited previews or and the full book where allowed.[133]\n\n\nGoogle expanded its search services to include shopping (launched originally as Froogle in 2002),[134] finance (launched 2006),[135] and flights (launched 2011).[136]\n\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Google on ad-tech London, 2010\nGoogle generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on Google and YouTube, Android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Forty-six percent of this profit was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namely AdMob, AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.[137]\n\n\nIn addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology its acquisition of DoubleClick, to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history.[138][139]\n\n\nIn 2007, Google launched \"AdSense for Mobile\", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market.[140]\n\n\nGoogle Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.[141] Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google Ads allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.[142] The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.[143] One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.[144] Google Search Console (rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security issues of their websites, as well as optimize their website's visibility.\n\n\n\n### Consumer services[edit]\n\n\n#### Web-based services[edit]\n\n\nGoogle offers Gmail for email,[145] Google Calendar for time-management and scheduling,[146] Google Maps for mapping, navigation and satellite imagery,[147] Google Drive for cloud storage of files,[148] Google Docs, Sheets and Slides for productivity,[148] Google Photos for photo storage and sharing,[149] Google Keep for note-taking,[150] Google Translate for language translation,[151] YouTube for video viewing and sharing,[152] Google My Business for managing public business information,[153] and Duo for social interaction.[154] In March 2019, Google unveiled a cloud gaming service named Stadia.[108] A job search product has also existed since before 2017,[155][156][157] Google for Jobs is an enhanced search feature that aggregates listings from job boards and career sites.[158]\n\n\nSome Google services are not web-based. Google Earth, launched in 2005, allowed users to see high-definition satellite pictures from all over the world for free through a client software downloaded to their computers.[159]\n\n\n\n#### Software[edit]\n\n\nGoogle develops the Android mobile operating system,[160] as well as its smartwatch,[161] television,[162] car,[163] and Internet of things-enabled smart devices variations.[164]\n\n\nIt also develops the Google Chrome web browser,[165] and ChromeOS, an operating system based on Chrome.[166]\n\n\n\n#### Hardware[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Google Pixel smartphones on display in a store\nIn January 2010, Google released Nexus One, the first Android phone under its own brand.[167] It spawned a number of phones and tablets under the \"Nexus\" branding[168] until its eventual discontinuation in 2016, replaced by a new brand called Pixel.[169]\n\n\nIn 2011, the Chromebook was introduced, which runs on ChromeOS.[170]\n\n\nIn July 2013, Google introduced the Chromecast dongle, which allows users to stream content from their smartphones to televisions.[171][172]\n\n\nIn June 2014, Google announced Google Cardboard, a simple cardboard viewer that lets the user place their smartphone in a special front compartment to view virtual reality (VR) media.[173]\n\n\nOther hardware products include:\n\n\n\n* Nest, a series of voice assistant smart speakers that can answer voice queries, play music, find information from apps (calendar, weather etc.), and control third-party smart home appliances (users can tell it to turn on the lights, for example). The Google Nest line includes the original Google Home[174] (later succeeded by the Nest Audio), the Google Home Mini (later succeeded by the Nest Mini), the Google Home Max, the Google Home Hub (later rebranded as the Nest Hub), and the Nest Hub Max.\n* Nest Wifi (originally Google Wifi), a connected set of Wi-Fi routers to simplify and extend coverage of home Wi-Fi.[175]\n\n\n### Enterprise services[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform\n\nGoogle Workspace (formerly G Suite until October 2020[176]) is a monthly subscription offering for organizations and businesses to get access to a collection of Google's services, including Gmail, Google Drive and Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides, with additional administrative tools, unique domain names, and 24/7 support.[177]\n\n\nOn September 24, 2012,[178] Google launched Google for Entrepreneurs, a largely not-for-profit business incubator providing startups with co-working spaces known as Campuses, with assistance to startup founders that may include workshops, conferences, and mentorships.[179] Presently, there are seven Campus locations: Berlin, London, Madrid, Seoul, São Paulo, Tel Aviv, and Warsaw.\n\n\nOn March 15, 2016, Google announced the introduction of Google Analytics 360 Suite, \"a set of integrated data and marketing analytics products, designed specifically for the needs of enterprise-class marketers\" which can be integrated with BigQuery on the Google Cloud Platform. Among other things, the suite is designed to help \"enterprise class marketers\" \"see the complete customer journey\", generate \"useful insights\", and \"deliver engaging experiences to the right people\".[180] Jack Marshall of *The Wall Street Journal* wrote that the suite competes with existing marketing cloud offerings by companies including Adobe, Oracle, Salesforce, and IBM.[181]\n\n\n\n### Internet services[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2010, Google announced the Google Fiber project, with experimental plans to build an ultra-high-speed broadband network for 50,000 to 500,000 customers in one or more American cities.[182][183] Following Google's corporate restructure to make Alphabet Inc. its parent company, Google Fiber was moved to Alphabet's Access division.[184][185]\n\n\nIn April 2015, Google announced Project Fi, a mobile virtual network operator, that combines Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different telecommunication providers in an effort to enable seamless connectivity and fast Internet signal.[186][187]\n\n\n\n### Financial services[edit]\n\n\nAs a more mature company, Google has made many moves into financial services.\n\n\nIn August 2023, it became the first major tech company to join the OpenWallet Foundation, launched earlier in the year, whose goal was creating open-source software for interoperable digital wallets.[188]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n### Stock price performance and quarterly earnings[edit]\n\n\nGoogle's initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004. At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[65][66] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[69] The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,[189] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market.[190] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds.[190] GOOG shares split into GOOG class C shares and GOOGL class A shares.[191] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google's holding company, since the fourth quarter of 2015.[update][192]\n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profit, largely due to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.[193][194][195]\n\n\nFor the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only $112 million in licensing and other revenues.[196] In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs.[197]\n\n\nGoogle generated $50 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2012, generating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, \"We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half.\"[198]\n\n\nGoogle's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.[199] Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on advertisements.[200] By January 2014, Google's market capitalization had grown to $397 billion.[201]\n\n\n\n### Tax avoidance strategies[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland § Multinational tax schemes, and Google tax\n\nGoogle uses various tax avoidance strategies. On the list of largest technology companies by revenue, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through Ireland and the Netherlands and then to Bermuda. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in, for instance, the UK is 28 per cent.[202] This reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's transfer pricing practices in 2012.[203]\n\n\nIn 2020, Google said it had overhauled its controversial global tax structure and consolidated all of its intellectual property holdings back to the US.[204]\n\n\nGoogle Vice-president Matt Brittin testified to the Public Accounts Committee of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.[205] In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.[206] In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax bill.[207]\n\n\nIn 2013, Google ranked 5th in lobbying spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.[208]\n\n\n\n### Corporate identity[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of Google § Name, Google (verb), Google logo, Google Doodle, List of Google April Fools' Day jokes, and List of Google Easter eggs\n\n![](image)Google's logo from 2013 to 2015\nThe name \"Google\" originated from a misspelling of \"googol\",[209][210] which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original paper on PageRank:[32] \"We chose our system name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100[,] and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines.\" Having found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb \"google\" was added to the *Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary* and the *Oxford English Dictionary* in 2006, meaning \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.\"[211][212] Google's mission statement, from the outset, was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\",[213] and its unofficial slogan is \"Don't be evil\".[214] In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: \"Do the right thing\".[215] The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet.\n\n\nThe original Google logo was designed by Sergey Brin.[216] Since 1998,[update] Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays, events, achievements and people. The first Google Doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival of 1998.[217][218] The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed \"Doodlers\".[219]\n\n\nGoogle has a tradition of creating April Fools' Day jokes. Its first on April 1, 2000, was Google MentalPlex which allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.[220] In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called TiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a fiber-optic cable down their toilet.[221]\n\n\nGoogle's services contain easter eggs, such as the Swedish Chef's \"Bork bork bork,\" Pig Latin, \"Hacker\" or leetspeak, Elmer Fudd, Pirate, and Klingon as language selections for its search engine.[222] When searching for the word \"anagram,\" meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google's suggestion feature displays \"Did you mean: nag a ram?\"[223] Since 2019, Google runs free online courses to help engineers learn how to plan and author technical documentation better.[224]\n\n\n\n### Workplace culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Google employees marching in the Pride in London parade in 2016\nOn *Fortune* magazine's list of the best companies to work for, Google ranked first in 2007, 2008 and 2012,[225][226][227] and fourth in 2009 and 2010.[228][229] Google was also nominated in 2010 to be the world's most attractive employer to graduating students in the Universum Communications talent attraction index.[230] Google's corporate philosophy includes principles such as \"you can make money without doing evil,\" \"you can be serious without a suit,\" and \"work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun.\"[231]\n\n\nAs of September 30, 2020,[update] Alphabet Inc. had 132,121 employees,[232] of which more than 100,000 worked for Google.[8] Google's 2020[update] diversity report states that 32 percent of its workforce are women and 68 percent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being predominantly white (51.7%) and Asian (41.9%).[233] Within tech roles, 23.6 percent were women; and 26.7 percent of leadership roles were held by women.[234] In addition to its 100,000+ full-time employees, Google used about 121,000 temporary workers and contractors, as of March 2019.[update][8]\n\n\nGoogle's employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are split into six hierarchies based on experience and can range \"from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and experienced engineers at level six.\"[235] As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them. Some of Google's services, such as Gmail, Google News, Orkut, and AdSense originated from these independent endeavors.[236] In a talk at Stanford University, Marissa Mayer, Google's vice-president of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.[237]\n\n\nIn 2005, articles in *The New York Times*[238] and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy.[239][240][241] In an effort to maintain the company's unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer whose purpose was to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on.[242] Google has also faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees.[243][244] In 2013, a class action against several Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged \"no cold call\" agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[245] In a lawsuit filed January 8, 2018, multiple employees and job applicants alleged Google discriminated against a class defined by their \"conservative political views[,] male gender[,] and/or [...] Caucasian or Asian race\".[246]\n\n\nOn January 25, 2020, the formation of an international workers union of Google employees, Alpha Global, was announced.[247] The coalition is made up of \"13 different unions representing workers in 10 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Switzerland.\"[248] The group is affiliated with UNI Global Union, which represents nearly 20 million international workers from various unions and federations. The formation of the union is in response to persistent allegations of mistreatment of Google employees and a toxic workplace culture.[248][249][246] Google had previously been accused of surveilling and firing employees who were suspected of organizing a workers union.[250] In 2021 court documents revealed that between 2018 and 2020 Google ran an anti-union campaign called Project Vivian to \"convince them (employees) that unions suck\".[251]\n\n\n\n### Office locations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Googleplex\n\n![](image)Google's New York City office building houses its largest advertising sales team.\n![](image)Google's Toronto office\nGoogle's headquarters in Mountain View, California is referred to as \"the Googleplex\", a play on words on the number googolplex and the headquarters itself being a *complex* of buildings. Internationally, Google has over 78 offices in more than 50 countries.[252]\n\n\nIn 2006, Google moved into about 300,000 square feet (27,900 m2) of office space at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. The office was designed and built specially for Google, and houses its largest advertising sales team.[253] In 2010, Google bought the building housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the property at around $1.9 billion.[254][255] In March 2018, Google's parent company Alphabet bought the nearby Chelsea Market building for $2.4 billion. The sale is touted as one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in the history of New York.[256][257][258][259] In November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees.[260] The same December, it was announced that a $1 billion, 1,700,000-square-foot (160,000 m2) headquarters for Google would be built in Manhattan's Hudson Square neighborhood.[261][262] Called Google Hudson Square, the new campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York City.[263]\n\n\nBy late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[264] In November 2006, Google opened offices on Carnegie Mellon's campus in Pittsburgh, focusing on shopping-related advertisement coding and smartphone applications and programs.[265][266] Other office locations in the U.S. include Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Boulder, Colorado; Cambridge, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Kirkland, Washington; Birmingham, Michigan; Reston, Virginia, Washington, D.C.,[267] and Madison, Wisconsin.[268]\n\n\n\n![](image)Google's Dublin Ireland office, headquarters of Google Ads for Europe\nIt also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namely Sydney (birthplace location of Google Maps)[269] and London (part of Android development).[270] In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new London headquarter, a 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal's announcement in January,[271] Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to the Camden Council in June 2017.[272][273] In May 2015, Google announced its intention to create its own campus in Hyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the company's largest outside the United States, will accommodate 13,000 employees.[274][275]\n\n\nGoogle's Global Offices sum a total of 85 Locations worldwide,[276] with 32 offices in North America, 3 of them in Canada and 29 in United States Territory, California being the state with the most Google's offices with 9 in total including the Googleplex. In the Latin America Region Google counts with 6 offices, in Europe 24 (3 of them in UK), the Asia Pacific region counts with 18 offices principally 4 in India and 3 in China, and the Africa Middle East region counts 5 offices.\n\n\n\n#### North America[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country or US State\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Ann Arbor | ![](image) Michigan |\n| 2. | Atlanta | ![](image) Georgia |\n| 3. | Austin | ![](image) Texas |\n| 4. | Boulder | ![](image) Colorado |\n| 5. | Boulder – Pearl Place | ![](image) Colorado |\n| 6. | Boulder – Walnut | ![](image) Colorado |\n| 7. | Cambridge | ![](image) Massachusetts |\n| 8. | Chapel Hill | ![](image) North Carolina |\n| 9. | Chicago – Carpenter | ![](image) Illinois |\n| 10. | Chicago – Fulton Market | ![](image) Illinois |\n| 11. | Detroit | ![](image) Michigan |\n| 12. | Irvine | ![](image) California |\n| 13. | Kirkland | ![](image) Washington |\n| 14. | Kitchener | ![](image) Canada |\n| 15. | Los Angeles | ![](image) California |\n| 16. | Madison | ![](image) Wisconsin |\n| 17. | Miami | ![](image) Florida |\n| 18. | Montreal | ![](image) Canada |\n| 19. | Mountain View | ![](image) California |\n| 20. | New York | ![](image) New York |\n| 21. | Pittsburgh | ![](image) Pennsylvania |\n| 22. | Playa Vista | ![](image) California |\n| 23. | Portland | ![](image) Oregon |\n| 24. | Redwood City | ![](image) California |\n| 25. | Reston | ![](image) Virginia |\n| 26. | San Bruno | ![](image) California |\n| 27. | San Diego | ![](image) California |\n| 28. | San Francisco – **HQ** | ![](image) California |\n| 29. | Seattle | ![](image) Washington |\n| 30. | Sunnyvale | ![](image) California |\n| 31. | Toronto | ![](image) Canada |\n| 32. | Washington DC | ![](image) District of Columbia |\n\n\n#### Latin America[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Belo Horizonte | ![](image) Brazil |\n| 2. | Bogotá | ![](image) Colombia |\n| 3. | Buenos Aires | ![](image) Argentina |\n| 4. | Mexico City | ![](image) Mexico |\n| 5. | Santiago de Chile | ![](image) Chile |\n| 6. | São Paulo | ![](image) Brazil |\n\n\n#### Europe[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Aarhus | ![](image) Denmark |\n| 2. | Amsterdam | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| 3. | Athens | ![](image) Greece |\n| 4. | Berlin | ![](image) Germany |\n| 5. | Brussels | ![](image) Belgium |\n| 6. | Copenhagen | ![](image) Denmark |\n| 7. | Dublin | ![](image) Ireland |\n| 8. | Hamburg | ![](image) Germany |\n| 9. | Lisbon | ![](image) Portugal |\n| 10. | London – 6PS | ![](image) United Kingdom |\n| 11. | London – BEL | ![](image) United Kingdom |\n| 12. | London – CSG | ![](image) United Kingdom |\n| 13. | Madrid | ![](image) Spain |\n| 14. | Milan | ![](image) Italy |\n| 15. | Moscow | ![](image) Russia |\n| 16. | Munich | ![](image) Germany |\n| 17. | Oslo | ![](image) Norway |\n| 18. | Paris | ![](image) France |\n| 19. | Prague | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| 20. | Stockholm | ![](image) Sweden |\n| 21. | Vienna | ![](image) Austria |\n| 22. | Warsaw | ![](image) Poland |\n| 23. | Wroclaw | ![](image) Poland |\n| 24. | Zurich – BRA | ![](image) Switzerland |\n| 25. | Zurich – EUR | ![](image) Switzerland |\n\n\n#### Asia-Pacific[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Auckland | ![](image) New Zealand |\n| 2. | Bangalore | ![](image) India |\n| 3. | Bangkok | ![](image) Thailand |\n| 4. | Beijing | ![](image) China |\n| 5. | Guangzhou | ![](image) China |\n| 6. | Gurgaon | ![](image) India |\n| 7. | Hong Kong | ![](image) Hong Kong |\n| 8. | Hyderabad | ![](image) India |\n| 9. | Jakarta | ![](image) Indonesia |\n| 10. | Kuala Lumpur | ![](image) Malaysia |\n| 11. | Manila | ![](image) Philippines |\n| 12. | Melbourne | ![](image) Australia |\n| 13. | Mumbai | ![](image) India |\n| 14. | Seoul | ![](image) South Korea |\n| 15. | Shanghai | ![](image) China |\n| 16. | Singapore | ![](image) Singapore |\n| 17. | Sydney | ![](image) Australia |\n| 18. | Taipei | ![](image) Taiwan |\n| 19. | Tokyo – RPG | ![](image) Japan |\n| 20. | Tokyo – STRM | ![](image) Japan |\n\n\n#### Africa and the Middle East[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| SN | City | Country\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Dubai | ![](image) United Arab Emirates |\n| 2. | Haifa | ![](image) Israel |\n| 3. | Istanbul | ![](image) Turkey |\n| 4. | Johannesburg | ![](image) South Africa |\n| 5. | Tel Aviv | ![](image) Israel |\n\n\n### Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Google data centers\n\nGoogle has data centers in North and South America, Asia, and Europe.[277] There is no official data on the number of servers in Google data centers; however, research and advisory firm Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers.[278] Traditionally, Google relied on parallel computing on commodity hardware like mainstream x86 computers (similar to home PCs) to keep costs per query low.[279][280][281] In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only revealed in 2009.[281]\n\n\nGoogle has built its own private submarine communications cables. The first cable, named Curie, connects California with Chile and was completed on November 15, 2019.[282][283] The second fully Google-owned undersea cable, named Dunant, connects the United States with France and is planned to begin operation in 2020.[284] Google's third subsea cable, Equiano, will connect Lisbon, Portugal with Lagos, Nigeria and Cape Town, South Africa.[285] The company's fourth cable, named Grace Hopper, connects landing points in New York, US, Bude, UK and Bilbao, Spain, and is expected to become operational in 2022.[286]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of solar panels to provide up to 1.6 Megawatt of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus' energy needs.[287][288] The system is the largest rooftop photovoltaic power station constructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world.[287] Since 2007,[update] Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.[289]\n\n\nGoogle disclosed in September 2011 that it \"continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes\", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.[290]\n\n\nIn 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8 million into two wind farms in North Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes.[291] In February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.[292] The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.[293]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of power for 20 years.[294]\n\n\nIn December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it would purchase enough renewable energy to match 100% of the energy usage of its data centers and offices. The commitment will make Google \"the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy\".[295][296][297]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma.[298] In September 2019, Google's chief executive announced plans for a $2 billion wind and solar investment, the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. This will grow their green energy profile by 40%, giving them an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean energy, the company said.[299]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Google announced it had retroactively offset all of its carbon emissions since the company's foundation in 1998.[300] It also committed to operating its data centers and offices using only carbon-free energy by 2030.[301] In October 2020, the company pledged to make the packaging for its hardware products 100% plastic-free and 100% recyclable by 2025. It also said that all its final assembly manufacturing sites will achieve a UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification by 2022 by ensuring that the vast majority of waste from the manufacturing process is recycled instead of ending up in a landfill.[302]\n\n\n\n#### Climate change denial and misinformation[edit]\n\n\nGoogle donates to climate change denial political groups including the State Policy Network and the Competitive Enterprise Institute.[303][304] The company also actively funds and profits from climate disinformation by monetizing ad spaces on most of the largest climate disinformation sites.[305] Google continued to monetize and profit from sites propagating climate disinformation even after the company updated their policy to prohibit placing their ads on similar sites.[306]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Google.org\n\nIn 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic Google.org, with a start-up fund of $1 billion.[307] The mission of the organization is to create awareness about climate change, global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired Larry Brilliant as the program's executive director in 2004[308] and Megan Smith has since[update] replaced him as director.[309]\n\n\nIn March 2007, in partnership with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), Google hosted the first Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at its headquarters in Mountain View.[310] In 2011, Google donated 1 million euros to International Mathematical Olympiad to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).[311][312] In July 2012, Google launched a \"Legalize Love\" campaign in support of gay rights.[313]\n\n\nIn 2008, Google announced its \"project 10100\" which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.[314] After two years of silence, during which many wondered what had happened to the program,[315] Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.[316]\n\n\nResponding to the humanitarian crisis after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Google announced a $15 million donation to support Ukrainian citizens.[317] The company also decided to transform its office in Warsaw into a help center for refugees.[318]\n\n\nAlso in February 2022, Google announced a $100 million fund to expand skills training and job placement for low-income Americans, in conjunction with non-profits Year Up, Social Finance, and Merit America.[319]\n\n\n\n## Criticism and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Criticism of Google, Censorship by Google, and Privacy concerns regarding Google\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section should include a better summary of Criticism of Google.** See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this article's main text. *(April 2019)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)San Francisco activists protest privately owned shuttle buses that transport workers for tech companies such as Google from their homes in San Francisco and Oakland to corporate campuses in Silicon Valley.\nGoogle has had criticism over issues such as aggressive tax avoidance,[320] search neutrality, copyright, censorship of search results and content,[321] and privacy.[322][323]\n\n\nOther criticisms are alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of other people's intellectual property, concerns that its compilation of data may violate people's privacy, and the energy consumption of its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such as monopoly, restraint of trade, anti-competitive practices, and patent infringement.\n\n\nGoogle formerly complied with Internet censorship policies of the People's Republic of China,[324] enforced by means of filters colloquially known as \"The Great Firewall of China\", but no longer does so. As a result, all Google services except for Chinese Google Maps are blocked from access within mainland China without the aid of virtual private networks, proxy servers, or other similar technologies.\n\n\n\n### 2018[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Mozilla program manager Chris Peterson accused Google of intentionally slowing down YouTube performance on Firefox.[325][326]\n\n\nIn August 2018, The Intercept reported that Google is developing for the People's Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as Dragonfly) \"that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest\".[327][328] However, the project had been withheld due to privacy concerns.[329][330]\n\n\n\n### 2019[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, a hub for critics of Google dedicated to abstaining from using Google products coalesced in the Reddit online community /r/degoogle.[331] The DeGoogle grassroots campaign continues to grow as privacy activists highlight information about Google products, and the associated incursion on personal privacy rights by the company.\n\n\nIn April 2019, former Mozilla executive Jonathan Nightingale accused Google of intentionally and systematically sabotaging the Firefox browser over the past decade in order to boost adoption of Google Chrome.[332]\n\n\nIn November 2019, the Office for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human Services began investigation into Project Nightingale, to assess whether the \"mass collection of individuals' medical records\" complied with HIPAA.[333] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, Google secretively began the project in 2018, with St. Louis-based healthcare company Ascension.[334]\n\n\n\n### 2022[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2022 National Labor Relations Board ruling, court documents suggested that Google sponsored a secretive project—*Project Vivian*—to counsel its employees and to discourage them from forming unions.[335]\n\n\n\n### 2023[edit]\n\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Google placed an ad against anti-disinformation Brazilian Congressional Bill No. 2630, which was about to be approved, on its search homepage in Brazil, calling on its users to ask congressional representatives to oppose the legislation. The country's government and judiciary accused the company of undue interference in the congressional debate, saying it could amount to abuse of economic power and ordering the company to change the ad within two hours of notification or face fines of R$1 million (2023) (US$185,528.76) per non-compliance hour. The company then promptly removed the ad.[336][337]\n\n\n\n### Racially-targeted surveillance[edit]\n\n\nGoogle has aided controversial governments in mass surveillance projects, sharing with police and military the identities of those protesting racial injustice. In 2020, they shared with the FBI information collected from all Android users at a Black Lives Matter protest in Seattle,[338] including those who had opted out of location data collection.[339][340]\n\n\nGoogle is also part of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion deal in which the technology companies Google and Amazon will provide Israel and its military with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cloud computing services, including building local cloud sites that will \"keep information within Israel's borders under strict security guidelines.\"[341][342][343] The contract has been criticized by shareholders as well as their employees over concerns that the project will lead to further abuses of Palestinians' human rights in the context of the ongoing illegal occupation and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[344][345] Ariel Koren, a former marketing manager for Google's educational products and an outspoken critic of the project, wrote that Google \"systematically silences Palestinian, Jewish, Arab and Muslim voices concerned about Google's complicity in violations of Palestinian human rights—to the point of formally retaliating against workers and creating an environment of fear,\" reflecting her view that the ultimatum came in retaliation for her opposition to and organization against the project.[341][346]\n\n\n\n### Anti-trust, privacy, and other litigation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Google litigation\n\n![](image)The European Commission, which imposed three fines on Google in 2017, 2018, and 2019\n#### Fines and lawsuits[edit]\n\n\n##### European Union[edit]\n\n\nOn June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of €2.42 billion from the European Union for \"promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results.\"[347]\n\n\nOn July 18, 2018,[348] the European Commission fined Google €4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The abuse of dominant position has been referred to Google's constraint applied to Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed[349] that it had appealed the fine to the General Court of the European Union.[350]\n\n\nOn October 8, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to \"non-public\" Google+ account data being exposed as a result of a bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the private information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to claimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each.[351][352][353]\n\n\nOn March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a €1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for preventing rivals from being able to \"compete and innovate fairly\" in the online advertising market. European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust rules by \"imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites\" that required them to exclude search results from Google's rivals.[354][355]\n\n\nOn September 14, 2022, Google lost the appeal over €4.125bn (£3.5bn) fine, which was ruled to be paid after it was proved by the European Commission that Google forced Android phone-makers to carry Google's search and web browser apps. Since the initial accusations, Google changed its policy.[356]\n\n\n\n##### France[edit]\n\n\nOn January 21, 2019, French data regulator CNIL imposed a record €50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google issued a statement saying it was \"deeply committed\" to transparency and was \"studying the decision\" before determining its response.[357]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2022, France's data privacy regulatory body CNIL fined Alphabet's Google 150 million euros (US$169 million) for not allowing its Internet users an easy refusal of Cookies along with Facebook.[358]\n\n\n\n##### United States[edit]\n\n\nAfter U.S. Congressional hearings in July 2020,[359] and a report from the U.S. House of Representatives' Antitrust Subcommittee released in early October[360] the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google on October 20, 2020, asserting that it has illegally maintained its monopoly position in web search and search advertising.[361][362] The lawsuit alleged that Google engaged in anticompetitive behavior by paying Apple between $8 billion-$12 billion to be the default search engine on iPhones.[363] Later that month, both Facebook and Alphabet agreed to \"cooperate and assist one another\" in the face of investigation into their online advertising practices.[364][365] Another suit was brought against Google in 2023 for illegally monopolizing the advertising technology market.[366]\n\n\n\n#### Private browsing lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Private browsing\n\nIn early June 2020, a $5 billion class-action lawsuit was filed against Google by a group of consumers, alleging that Chrome's Incognito browsing mode still collects their user history.[367][368] The lawsuit became known in March 2021 when a federal judge denied Google's request to dismiss the case, ruling that they must face the group's charges.[369][370] Reuters reported that the lawsuit alleged that Google's CEO Sundar Pichai sought to keep the users unaware of this issue.[371]\n\n\n\n#### Gender discrimination lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, three women sued Google, accusing the company of violating California's Equal Pay Act by underpaying its female employees. The lawsuit cited the wage gap was around $17,000 and that Google locked women into lower career tracks, leading to smaller salaries and bonuses. In June 2022, Google agreed to pay a $118 million settlement to 15,550 female employees working in California since 2013. As a part of the settlement, Google also agreed to hire a third party to analyze its hiring and compensation practices.[372][373][374]\n\n\n\n#### U.S. government contracts[edit]\n\n\nFollowing media reports about PRISM, the NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.[375] According to unnamed sources, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009, as YouTube in 2010.[376]\n\n\nGoogle has worked with the United States Department of Defense on drone software through the 2017 Project Maven that could be used to improve the accuracy of drone strikes.[377] In April 2018, thousands of Google employees, including senior engineers, signed a letter urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to end this controversial contract with the Pentagon.[378] Google ultimately decided not to renew this DoD contract, which was set to expire in 2019.[379]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Google\n* History of Google\n* List of Google products\n* Google China\n* Google logo\n* Googlization\n* Google.org\n* Google ATAP\n* List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Google was incorporated on September 4, 1998, however, since 2002, the company has celebrated its anniversaries on various days in September, most frequently on September 27.[1][2][3] The shift in dates reportedly happened to celebrate index-size milestones in tandem with the birthday.[4]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Fitzpatrick, Alex (September 4, 2014). \"Google Used to Be the Company That Did 'Nothing But Search'\". *Time*.\n2. **^** \"When is Google's birthday – and why are people confused?\". *The Telegraph*.

Microsoft's best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, and the Edge web browser. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 14 in the 2022 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue;[2] it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2022. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, and Meta.\n\n\nMicrosoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in October 2023,[3] followed by its acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[4] and its acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.[5]\n\n\nAs of 2015[update], Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.[6] The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).\n\n\nSteve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000 and later envisioned a \"devices and services\" strategy.[7] This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008,[8] entering the personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the company's shares reach their highest value since December 1999.[9][10] Under Nadella's direction, the company has also heavily expanded it's gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022, dedicated to operating Xbox in addition to it's three subsidiaries (publishers). Microsoft Gaming is the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue as of 2023.[11]\n\n\nEarlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018, Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.[12] In April 2019, Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon, respectively. As of 2023[update], Microsoft has the third-highest global brand valuation.\n\n\nMicrosoft has been criticized for its monopolistic practices and the company's software has been criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Microsoft\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Microsoft.\n\n### 1972–1985: Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An Altair 8800 computer (left) with the popular Model 33 ASR Teletype as terminal, paper tape reader, and paper tape punch\n![](image)Paul Allen and Bill Gates on October 19, 1981, after signing a pivotal contract with IBM[13]: 228\n![](image)Bill Gates and Paul Allen's Original Business Cards located in the Microsoft Visitor Center.\nChildhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen sought to make a business using their skills in computer programming.[14] In 1972, they founded Traf-O-Data, which sold a rudimentary computer to track and analyze automobile traffic data. Gates enrolled at Harvard University while Allen pursued a degree in computer science at Washington State University, though he later dropped out to work at Honeywell.[15] The January 1975 issue of *Popular Electronics* featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems's (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer,[16] which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device. Gates called MITS and claimed that he had a working interpreter, and MITS requested a demonstration. Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter, and it worked flawlessly when they demonstrated it to MITS in March 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC.[13]: 108, 112–114 Gates and Allen established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as CEO,[17] and Allen suggested the name \"Micro-Soft,\" short for micro-computer software.[18][19] In August 1977, the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office of ASCII Microsoft.[20] Microsoft moved its headquarters to Bellevue, Washington, in January 1979.[17]\n\n\nMicrosoft entered the operating system (OS) business in 1980 with its own version of Unix called Xenix,[21] but it was MS-DOS that solidified the company's dominance. IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS to be used in the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC).[22] For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products which it branded as MS-DOS, although IBM rebranded it to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981. IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, so other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor.[23][24]: 210 The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as with a publishing division named Microsoft Press.[13]: 232\nPaul Allen resigned from Microsoft in 1983 after developing Hodgkin's lymphoma.[25] Allen claimed in *Idea Man: A Memoir by the Co-founder of Microsoft* that Gates wanted to dilute his share in the company when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease because he did not think that he was working hard enough.[26] Allen later invested in low-tech sectors, sports teams, commercial real estate, neuroscience, private space flight, and more.[27]\n\n\n\n### 1985–1994: Windows and Office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Windows 1.0 was released on November 20, 1985, as the first version of the Windows line.\nMicrosoft released Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical extension for MS-DOS,[13]: 242–243, 246 despite having begun jointly developing OS/2 with IBM the previous August.[28] Microsoft moved its headquarters from Bellevue to Redmond, Washington, on February 26, 1986, and went public on March 13,[29] with the resulting rise in stock making an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.[30] Microsoft released its version of OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987.[13] In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission examined Microsoft for possible collusion due to the partnership with IBM, marking the beginning of more than a decade of legal clashes with the government.[31] : 243–244 Meanwhile, the company was at work on Microsoft Windows NT, which was heavily based on their copy of the OS/2 code. It shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and the 32-bit Win32 application programming interface (API), making it easier to port from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based) Windows. Microsoft informed IBM of Windows NT, and the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.[32]\n\n\nIn 1990, Microsoft introduced the Microsoft Office suite which bundled separate applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.[13]: 301 On May 22, Microsoft launched Windows 3.0, featuring streamlined user interface graphics and improved protected mode capability for the Intel 386 processor,[33] and both Office and Windows became dominant in their respective areas.[34][35]\n\n\nOn July 27, 1994, the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division filed a competitive impact statement that said: \"Beginning in 1988 and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti-competitive 'per processor licenses. Under a per-processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM's use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft's use of per processor licenses has increased.\"[36]\n\n\n\n### 1995–2007: Foray into the Web, Windows 95, Windows XP, and Xbox[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 1996, Microsoft released Windows CE, a version of the operating system meant for personal digital assistants and other tiny computers, shown here on the HP 300LX.\nFollowing Bill Gates's internal \"Internet Tidal Wave memo\" on May 26, 1995, Microsoft began to redefine its offerings and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web.[37] With a few exceptions of new companies, like Netscape, Microsoft was the only major and established company that acted fast enough to be a part of the World Wide Web practically from the start. Other companies like Borland, WordPerfect, Novell, IBM and Lotus, being much slower to adapt to the new situation, would give Microsoft market dominance.[38] The company released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, featuring pre-emptive multitasking, a completely new user interface with a novel start button, and 32-bit compatibility; similar to NT, it provided the Win32 API.[39][40]: 20 Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN, which was at first intended to be a competitor to the Internet,[*dubious – discuss*] and (for OEMs) Internet Explorer, a Web browser. Internet Explorer has not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes, because the boxes were printed before the team finished the Web browser, and instead were included in the Windows 95 Plus! pack.[41] Backed by a high-profile marketing campaign[42] and what *The New York Times* called \"the splashiest, most frenzied, most expensive introduction of a computer product in the industry's history,\"[43] Windows 95 quickly became a success.[44] Branching out into new markets in 1996, Microsoft and General Electric's NBC unit created a new 24/7 cable news channel, MSNBC.[45] Microsoft created Windows CE 1.0, a new OS designed for devices with low memory and other constraints, such as personal digital assistants.[46] In October 1997, the Justice Department filed a motion in the Federal District Court, stating that Microsoft violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.[13]: 323–324\n\n\n\n![](image)Microsoft released the first installment in the Xbox series of consoles in 2001. The Xbox, graphically powerful compared to its rivals, featured a standard PC's 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor.\nOn January 13, 2000, Bill Gates handed over the CEO position to Steve Ballmer, an old college friend of Gates and employee of the company since 1980, while creating a new position for himself as Chief Software Architect.[13]: 111, 228[17] Various companies including Microsoft formed the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance in October 1999 to (among other things) increase security and protect intellectual property through identifying changes in hardware and software. Critics decried the alliance as a way to enforce indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and over how computers behave, and as a form of digital rights management: for example, the scenario where a computer is not only secured for its owner but also secured against its owner as well.[47][48] On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of *United States v. Microsoft Corp.*,[49] calling the company an \"abusive monopoly.\"[50] Microsoft later settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2004.[29] On October 25, 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP, unifying the mainstream and NT lines of OS under the NT codebase.[51] The company released the Xbox later that year, entering the video game console market dominated by Sony and Nintendo.[52] In March 2004 the European Union brought antitrust legal action against the company, citing it abused its dominance with the Windows OS, resulting in a judgment of €497 million ($613 million) and requiring Microsoft to produce new versions of Windows XP without Windows Media Player: Windows XP Home Edition N and Windows XP Professional N.[53][54] In November 2005, the company's second video game console, the Xbox 360, was released. There were two versions, a basic version for $299.99 and a deluxe version for $399.99.[55]\n\n\nIncreasingly present in the hardware business following Xbox, Microsoft 2006 released the Zune series of digital media players, a successor of its previous software platform Portable Media Center. These expanded on previous hardware commitments from Microsoft following its original Microsoft Mouse in 1983; as of 2007 the company sold the best-selling wired keyboard (Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000), mouse (IntelliMouse), and desktop webcam (LifeCam) in the United States. That year the company also launched the Surface \"digital table\", later renamed PixelSense.[56]\n\n\n\n### 2007–2011: Microsoft Azure, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Microsoft Stores[edit]\n\n\n![](image)CEO Steve Ballmer at the MIX event in 2008. In an interview about his management style in 2005, he mentioned that his first priority was to get the people he delegates to in order. Ballmer also emphasized the need to continue pursuing new technologies even if initial attempts fail, citing the original attempts with Windows as an example.[57]\n![](image)Headquarters of the European Commission, which has imposed several fines on Microsoft\nReleased in January 2007, the next version of Windows, Vista, focused on features, security and a redesigned user interface dubbed Aero.[58][59] Microsoft Office 2007, released at the same time, featured a \"Ribbon\" user interface which was a significant departure from its predecessors. Relatively strong sales of both products helped to produce a record profit in 2007.[60] The European Union imposed another fine of €899 million ($1.4 billion) for Microsoft's lack of compliance with the March 2004 judgment on February 27, 2008, saying that the company charged rivals unreasonable prices for key information about its workgroup and backoffice servers.[61] Microsoft stated that it was in compliance and that \"these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved\".[62] 2007 also saw the creation of a multi-core unit at Microsoft, following the steps of server companies such as Sun and IBM.[63]\n\n\nGates retired from his role as Chief Software Architect on June 27, 2008, a decision announced in June 2006, while retaining other positions related to the company in addition to being an advisor for the company on key projects.[64][65] Azure Services Platform, the company's entry into the cloud computing market for Windows, launched on October 27, 2008.[66] On February 12, 2009, Microsoft announced its intent to open a chain of Microsoft-branded retail stores, and on October 22, 2009, the first retail Microsoft Store opened in Scottsdale, Arizona; the same day Windows 7 was officially released to the public. Windows 7's focus was on refining Vista with ease-of-use features and performance enhancements, rather than an extensive reworking of Windows.[67][68][69]\n\n\nAs the smartphone industry boomed in the late 2000s, Microsoft had struggled to keep up with its rivals in providing a modern smartphone operating system, falling behind Apple and Google-sponsored Android in the United States.[70] As a result, in 2010 Microsoft revamped their aging flagship mobile operating system, Windows Mobile, replacing it with the new Windows Phone OS that was released in October that year.[71][72] It used a new user interface design language, codenamed \"Metro,\" which prominently used simple shapes, typography, and iconography, utilizing the concept of minimalism. Microsoft implemented a new strategy for the software industry, providing a consistent user experience across all smartphones using the Windows Phone OS. It launched an alliance with Nokia in 2011 and Microsoft worked closely with the company to co-develop Windows Phone,[73] but remained partners with long-time Windows Mobile OEM HTC.[74] Microsoft is a founding member of the Open Networking Foundation started on March 23, 2011. Fellow founders were Google, HP Networking, Yahoo!, Verizon Communications, Deutsche Telekom and 17 other companies. This nonprofit organization is focused on providing support for a cloud computing initiative called Software-Defined Networking.[75] The initiative is meant to speed innovation through simple software changes in telecommunications networks, wireless networks, data centers, and other networking areas.[76]\n\n\n\n### 2011–2014: Windows 8/8.1, Xbox One, Outlook.com, and Surface devices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Surface Pro 3, part of the Surface series of laplets by Microsoft\nFollowing the release of Windows Phone, Microsoft undertook a gradual rebranding of its product range throughout 2011 and 2012, with the corporation's logos, products, services, and websites adopting the principles and concepts of the Metro design language.[77] Microsoft unveiled Windows 8, an operating system designed to power both personal computers and tablet computers, in Taipei in June 2011.[78] A developer preview was released on September 13, which was subsequently replaced by a consumer preview on February 29, 2012, and released to the public in May.[79] The Surface was unveiled on June 18, becoming the first computer in the company's history to have its hardware made by Microsoft.[80][81] On June 25, Microsoft paid US$1.2 billion to buy the social network Yammer.[82] On July 31, they launched the Outlook.com webmail service to compete with Gmail.[83] On September 4, 2012, Microsoft released Windows Server 2012.[84]\n\n\nIn July 2012, Microsoft sold its 50% stake in MSNBC, which it had run as a joint venture with NBC since 1996.[85] On October 1, Microsoft announced its intention to launch a news operation, part of a new-look MSN, with Windows 8 later in the month.[86] On October 26, 2012, Microsoft launched Windows 8 and the Microsoft Surface.[81][87] Three days later, Windows Phone 8 was launched.[88] To cope with the potential for an increase in demand for products and services, Microsoft opened a number of \"holiday stores\" across the U.S. to complement the increasing number of \"bricks-and-mortar\" Microsoft Stores that opened in 2012.[89] On March 29, 2013, Microsoft launched a Patent Tracker.[90]\n\n\nIn August 2012, the New York City Police Department announced a partnership with Microsoft for the development of the Domain Awareness System which is used for Police surveillance in New York City.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Xbox One console, released in 2013\nThe Kinect, a motion-sensing input device made by Microsoft and designed as a video game controller, first introduced in November 2010, was upgraded for the 2013 release of the Xbox One video game console. Kinect's capabilities were revealed in May 2013: an ultra-wide 1080p camera, function in the dark due to an infrared sensor, higher-end processing power and new software, the ability to distinguish between fine movements (such as a thumb movement), and determining a user's heart rate by looking at their face.[92] Microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers as part of a plan to make the viewing experience more interactive. On July 19, 2013, Microsoft stocks suffered their biggest one-day percentage sell-off since the year 2000, after its fourth-quarter report raised concerns among investors on the poor showings of both Windows 8 and the Surface tablet. Microsoft suffered a loss of more than US$32 billion.[93]\n\n\nIn line with the maturing PC business, in July 2013, Microsoft announced that it would reorganize the business into four new business divisions, namely Operating systems, Apps, Cloud, and Devices. All previous divisions will be dissolved into new divisions without any workforce cuts.[94] On September 3, 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy Nokia's mobile unit for $7 billion,[95] following Amy Hood taking the role of CFO.[96]\n\n\n\n\n### 2014–2020: Windows 10, Microsoft Edge, and HoloLens[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satya Nadella succeeded Steve Ballmer as the CEO of Microsoft in February 2014.\nOn February 4, 2014, Steve Ballmer stepped down as CEO of Microsoft and was succeeded by Satya Nadella, who previously led Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise division.[97] On the same day, John W. Thompson took on the role of chairman, in place of Bill Gates, who continued to participate as a technology advisor.[98] Thompson became the second chairman in Microsoft's history.[99] On April 25, 2014, Microsoft acquired Nokia Devices and Services for $7.2 billion.[100] This new subsidiary was renamed Microsoft Mobile Oy.[101] On September 15, 2014, Microsoft acquired the video game development company Mojang, best known for *Minecraft*, for $2.5 billion.[102] On June 8, 2017, Microsoft acquired Hexadite, an Israeli security firm, for $100 million.[103][104]\n\n\nOn January 21, 2015, Microsoft announced the release of their first Interactive whiteboard, Microsoft Surface Hub.[105] On July 29, 2015, Windows 10 was released,[106] with its server sibling, Windows Server 2016, released in September 2016. In Q1 2015, Microsoft was the third largest maker of mobile phones, selling 33 million units (7.2% of all). While a large majority (at least 75%) of them do not run any version of Windows Phone— those other phones are not categorized as smartphones by Gartner – in the same time frame 8 million Windows smartphones (2.5% of all smartphones) were made by all manufacturers (but mostly by Microsoft).[107] Microsoft's share of the U.S. smartphone market in January 2016 was 2.7%.[108] During the summer of 2015 the company lost $7.6 billion related to its mobile-phone business, firing 7,800 employees.[109]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2016, Microsoft announced the merger of its PC and Xbox divisions, with Phil Spencer announcing that Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps would be the focus for Microsoft's gaming in the future.[110] On January 24, 2017, Microsoft showcased Intune for Education at the BETT 2017 education technology conference in London.[111] Intune for Education is a new cloud-based application and device management service for the education sector.[112] In May 2016, the company announced it was laying off 1,850 workers, and taking an impairment and restructuring charge of $950 million.[109] In June 2016, Microsoft announced a project named Microsoft Azure Information Protection. It aims to help enterprises protect their data as it moves between servers and devices.[113] In November 2016, Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member during Microsoft's Connect(); developer event in New York.[114] The cost of each Platinum membership is US$500,000 per year.[115] Some analysts deemed this unthinkable ten years prior, however, as in 2001 then-CEO Steve Ballmer called Linux \"cancer\".[116] Microsoft planned to launch a preview of Intune for Education \"in the coming weeks,\" with general availability scheduled for spring 2017, priced at $30 per device, or through volume licensing agreements.[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Nokia Lumia 1320, the Microsoft Lumia 535 and the Nokia Lumia 530, which all run on one of the now-discontinued Windows Phone operating systems\nIn January 2018, Microsoft patched Windows 10 to account for CPU problems related to Intel's Meltdown security breach. The patch led to issues with the Microsoft Azure virtual machines reliant on Intel's CPU architecture. On January 12, Microsoft released PowerShell Core 6.0 for the macOS and Linux operating systems.[118] In February 2018, Microsoft killed notification support for their Windows Phone devices which effectively ended firmware updates for the discontinued devices.[118] In March 2018, Microsoft recalled Windows 10 S to change it to a mode for the Windows operating system rather than a separate and unique operating system. In March the company also established guidelines that censor users of Office 365 from using profanity in private documents.[118] In April 2018, Microsoft released the source code for Windows File Manager under the MIT License to celebrate the program's 20th anniversary. In April the company further expressed willingness to embrace open source initiatives by announcing Azure Sphere as its own derivative of the Linux operating system.[118] In May 2018, Microsoft partnered with 17 American intelligence agencies to develop cloud computing products. The project is dubbed \"Azure Government\" and has ties to the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) surveillance program.[118] On June 4, 2018, Microsoft officially announced the acquisition of GitHub for $7.5 billion, a deal that closed on October 26, 2018.[119][120] On July 10, 2018, Microsoft revealed the Surface Go platform to the public. Later in the month, it converted Microsoft Teams to gratis.[118] In August 2018, Microsoft released two projects called Microsoft AccountGuard and Defending Democracy. It also unveiled Snapdragon 850 compatibility for Windows 10 on the ARM architecture.[121][122][118]\n\n\n\n![](image)Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin using a Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality headset in September 2016\nIn August 2018, Toyota Tsusho began a partnership with Microsoft to create fish farming tools using the Microsoft Azure application suite for Internet of things (IoT) technologies related to water management. Developed in part by researchers from Kindai University, the water pump mechanisms use artificial intelligence to count the number of fish on a conveyor belt, analyze the number of fish, and deduce the effectiveness of water flow from the data the fish provide. The specific computer programs used in the process fall under the Azure Machine Learning and the Azure IoT Hub platforms.[123] In September 2018, Microsoft discontinued Skype Classic.[118] On October 10, 2018, Microsoft joined the Open Invention Network community despite holding more than 60,000 patents.[124] In November 2018, Microsoft agreed to supply 100,000 Microsoft HoloLens headsets to the United States military in order to \"increase lethality by enhancing the ability to detect, decide and engage before the enemy.\"[125] In November 2018, Microsoft introduced Azure Multi-Factor Authentication for Microsoft Azure.[126] In December 2018, Microsoft announced Project Mu, an open source release of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) core used in Microsoft Surface and Hyper-V products. The project promotes the idea of Firmware as a Service.[127] In the same month, Microsoft announced the open source implementation of Windows Forms and the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) which will allow for further movement of the company toward the transparent release of key frameworks used in developing Windows desktop applications and software. December also saw the company discontinue the Microsoft Edge project in favor of Chromium backends for their browsers.[126]\n\n\nOn February 20, 2019, Microsoft Corp said it will offer its cyber security service AccountGuard to 12 new markets in Europe including Germany, France and Spain, to close security gaps and protect customers in political space from hacking.[128] In February 2019, hundreds of Microsoft employees protested the company's war profiteering from a $480 million contract to develop virtual reality headsets for the United States Army.[129]\n\n\n\n### 2020–present: Acquisitions, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows 11[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft\n\nOn March 26, 2020, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Affirmed Networks for about $1.35 billion.[130][131] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft closed all of its retail stores indefinitely due to health concerns.[132] On July 22, 2020, Microsoft announced plans to close its Mixer service, planning to move existing partners to Facebook Gaming.[133]\n\n\nOn July 31, 2020, it was reported that Microsoft was in talks to acquire TikTok after the Trump administration ordered ByteDance to divest ownership of the application to the U.S.[134] On August 3, 2020, after speculation on the deal, Donald Trump stated that Microsoft could buy the application, however, it should be completed by September 15, 2020, and that the United States Department of the Treasury should receive a portion if it were to go through.[135]\n\n\nOn August 5, 2020, Microsoft stopped its xCloud game streaming test for iOS devices. According to Microsoft, the future of xCloud on iOS remains unclear and potentially out of Microsoft's hands. Apple has imposed a strict limit on \"remote desktop clients\" which means applications are only allowed to connect to a user-owned host device or gaming console owned by the user.[136] On September 21, 2020, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire video game company ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, for about $7.5 billion, with the deal expected to occur in the second half of 2021 fiscal year.[137] On March 9, 2021, the acquisition was finalized and ZeniMax Media became part of Microsoft's Xbox Game Studios division.[138] The total price of the deal was $8.1 billion.[139]\n\n\nOn September 22, 2020, Microsoft announced that it had an exclusive license to use OpenAI's GPT-3 artificial intelligence language generator.[140] The previous version of GPT-3, called GPT-2, made headlines for being \"too dangerous to release\" and had numerous capabilities, including designing websites, prescribing medication, answering questions, and penning articles.[141] On November 10, 2020, Microsoft released the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S video game consoles.[142]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Microsoft announced it would buy Nuance Communications for approximately $16 billion.[143] The acquisition of Nuance was completed in March 2022.[144] In 2021, in part due to the strong quarterly earnings spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft's valuation came to nearly $2 trillion. The increased necessity for remote work and distance education drove demand for cloud computing and grew the company's gaming sales.[145][146][147]\n\n\nOn June 24, 2021, Microsoft announced Windows 11 during a Livestream. The announcement came with confusion after Microsoft announced Windows 10 would be the last version of the operating system; set to be released in the third quarter of 2021.[148] It was released to the general public on October 5, 2021.[149]\n\n\nIn early September 2021, it was announced that the company had acquired Takelessons, an online platform which connects students and tutors in numerous subjects. The acquisition positioned Microsoft to grow its presence in the market of providing online education to large numbers of people.[150] In the same month, Microsoft acquired Australia-based video editing software company Clipchamp.[151]\n\n\nIn October 2021, Microsoft announced that it began rolling out end-to-end encryption (E2EE) support for Microsoft Teams calls in order to secure business communication while using video conferencing software. Users can ensure that their calls are encrypted and can utilize a security code that both parties on a call must verify on their respective ends.[152] On October 7, Microsoft acquired Ally.io, a software service that measures companies' progress against OKRs. Microsoft plans to incorporate Ally.io into its Viva family of employee experience products.[153]\n\n\nOn January 18, 2022, Microsoft announced the acquisition of American video game developer and holding company Activision Blizzard in an all-cash deal worth $68.7 billion.[154] Activision Blizzard is best known for producing franchises, including but not limited to *Warcraft*, *Diablo*, *Call of Duty*, *StarCraft*, *Candy Crush Saga*, *Crash Bandicoot*, *Spyro the Dragon*, *Skylanders*, and *Overwatch*.[155] Activision and Microsoft each released statements saying the acquisition was to benefit their businesses in the metaverse, many saw Microsoft's acquisition of video game studios as an attempt to compete against Meta Platforms, with *TheStreet* referring to Microsoft wanting to become \"the Disney of the metaverse\".[156][157] Microsoft also named Phil Spencer, head of the Xbox brand since 2014, the inaugural CEO of the newly established Microsoft Gaming division, which now houses the Xbox operations team and the three publishers in the company's portfolio (Xbox Game Studios, ZeniMax Media, Activision Blizzard). Microsoft has not released statements regarding Activision's recent legal controversies regarding employee abuse, but reports have alleged that Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, a major target of the controversy, will leave the company after the acquisition is finalized.[158] The deal was closed on October 13, 2023.[159]\n\n\nIn December 2022, Microsoft announced a new 10-year deal with the London Stock Exchange for products including Microsoft Azure; Microsoft acquired ~4% of the LSE as part of the deal.[160]\n\n\nIn January 2023, CEO Satya Nadella announced Microsoft would lay off some 10,000 employees.[161] The announcement came a day after hosting a Sting concert for 50 people, including Microsoft executives, in Davos, Switzerland.[162]\n\n\nOn January 23, 2023, Microsoft announced a new multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment deal with ChatGPT developer OpenAI.[163]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Microsoft; Internet censorship in China; and Embrace, extend, and extinguish\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nThe company is run by a board of directors made up of mostly company outsiders, as is customary for publicly traded companies. Members of the board of directors as of July 2020 are Satya Nadella, Reid Hoffman, Hugh Johnston, Teri List-Stoll, Sandi Peterson, Penny Pritzker, Charles Scharf, Arne Sorenson, John W. Stanton, John W. Thompson, Emma Walmsley and Padmasree Warrior.[164] Board members are elected every year at the annual shareholders' meeting using a majority vote system. There are four committees within the board that oversee more specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues with the company including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters including the nomination of the board; and the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee, which includes legal/antitrust matters, along with privacy, trade, digital safety, artificial intelligence, and environmental sustainability.[165]\n\n\nOn March 13, 2020, Gates announced that he is leaving the board of directors of Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus more on his philanthropic efforts. According to Aaron Tilley of *The Wall Street Journal* this is \"marking the biggest boardroom departure in the tech industry since the death of longtime rival and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs.\"[166]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft's board of directors plans to hire an external law firm to review its sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, and to release a summary of how the company handled past allegations of misconduct against Bill Gates and other corporate executives.[167]\n\n\n\n### Chief executives[edit]\n\n\n1.

As of July 2010, with the company's nine stock splits, any IPO shares would be multiplied by 288; if one were to buy the IPO today, given the splits and other factors, it would cost about 9 cents.[13]: 235–236[169][170] The stock price peaked in 1999 at around $119 ($60.928, adjusting for splits).[171] The company began to offer a dividend on January 16, 2003, starting at eight cents per share for the fiscal year followed by a dividend of sixteen cents per share the subsequent year, switching from yearly to quarterly dividends in 2005 with eight cents a share per quarter and a special one-time payout of three dollars per share for the second quarter of the fiscal year.[171][172] Though the company had subsequent increases in dividend payouts, the price of Microsoft's stock remained steady for years.[172][173]\n\n\nStandard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service have both given a AAA rating to Microsoft, whose assets were valued at $41 billion as compared to only $8.5 billion in unsecured debt. Consequently, in February 2011 Microsoft released a corporate bond amounting to $2.25 billion with relatively low borrowing rates compared to government bonds.[174] For the first time in 20 years Apple Inc. surpassed Microsoft in Q1 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge losses in Microsoft's Online Services Division (which contains its search engine Bing). Microsoft profits were $5.2 billion, while Apple Inc. profits were $6 billion, on revenues of $14.5 billion and $24.7 billion respectively.[175] Microsoft's Online Services Division has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and in Q1 2011 it lost $726 million. This follows a loss of $2.5 billion for the year 2010.[176]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2012, Microsoft posted its first quarterly loss ever, despite earning record revenues for the quarter and fiscal year, with a net loss of $492 million due to a writedown related to the advertising company aQuantive, which had been acquired for $6.2 billion back in 2007.[177] As of January 2014, Microsoft's market capitalization stood at $314B,[178] making it the 8th largest company in the world by market capitalization.[179] On November 14, 2014, Microsoft overtook ExxonMobil to become the second most-valuable company by market capitalization, behind only Apple Inc. Its total market value was over $410B—with the stock price hitting $50.04 a share, the highest since early 2000.[180] In 2015, Reuters reported that Microsoft Corp had earnings abroad of $76.4 billion which were untaxed by the Internal Revenue Service.

The two-year contract may result in follow-on orders of more than 100,000 headsets, according to documentation describing the bidding process. One of the contract's tag lines for the augmented reality technology seems to be its ability to enable \"25 bloodless battles before the 1st battle,\" suggesting that actual combat training is going to be an essential aspect of the augmented reality headset capabilities.[184]\n\n\n\n### Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nMicrosoft is an international business. As such, it needs subsidiaries present in whatever national markets it chooses to harvest. An example is Microsoft Canada, which it established in 1985.[185] Other countries have similar installations, to funnel profits back up to Redmond and to distribute the dividends to the holders of MSFT stock.\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Windows 8 Launch Event in Akihabara, Tokyo on October 25, 2012\nIn 2004, Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of Windows Server 2003 to Linux; the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux, thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company (i.e. lower TCO).[186] This spurred a wave of related studies; a study by the Yankee Group concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from Windows Server to Linux, although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using Microsoft products.[187] Another study, released by the Open Source Development Labs, claimed that the Microsoft studies were \"simply outdated and one-sided\" and their survey concluded that the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons.[188]\n\n\nAs part of the \"Get the Facts\" campaign, Microsoft highlighted the .NET Framework trading platform that it had developed in partnership with Accenture for the London Stock Exchange, claiming that it provided \"five nines\" reliability. After suffering extended downtime and unreliability[189][190] the London Stock Exchange announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a Linux-based one in 2010.[191][192]\n\n\nIn 2012, Microsoft hired a political pollster named Mark Penn, whom *The New York Times* called \"famous for bulldozing\" his political opponents[193] as Executive Vice-president, Advertising and Strategy. Penn created a series of negative advertisements targeting one of Microsoft's chief competitors, Google. The advertisements, called \"Scroogled,\" attempt to make the case that Google is \"screwing\" consumers with search results rigged to favor Google's paid advertisers, that Gmail violates the privacy of its users to place ad results related to the content of their emails and shopping results, which favor Google products. Tech publications like TechCrunch have been highly critical of the advertising campaign,[194] while Google employees have embraced it.[195]\n\n\n\n### Layoffs[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2014, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees. Microsoft employed 127,104 people as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft lay off ever. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft had eliminated 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with the Great Recession of 2008–2017.[196][197] In September 2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle–Redmond area, where the company is headquartered. The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously announced. This brought the total number to over 15,000 out of the 18,000 expected cuts.[198] In October 2014, Microsoft revealed that it was almost done with the elimination of 18,000 employees, which was its largest-ever layoff sweep.[199] In July 2015, Microsoft announced another 7,800 job cuts in the next several months.[200] In May 2016, Microsoft announced another 1,850 job cuts mostly in its Nokia mobile phone division. As a result, the company will record an impairment and restructuring charge of approximately $950 million, of which approximately $200 million will relate to severance payments.[201]\n\n\n\n### United States government[edit]\n\n\nMicrosoft provides information about reported bugs in their software to intelligence agencies of the United States government, prior to the public release of the fix. A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that the corporation runs several programs that facilitate the sharing of such information with the U.S. government.[202] Following media reports about PRISM, NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in May 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Microsoft.[203] According to leaks of said program, Microsoft joined the PRISM program in 2007.[204] However, in June 2013, an official statement from Microsoft flatly denied their participation in the program: \n\n\n> \"We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so, and never on a voluntary basis. In addition, we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data, we don't participate in it.\"[205]\n> \n> \n\n\nDuring the first six months of 2013, Microsoft received requests that affected between 15,000 and 15,999 accounts.[206] In December 2013, the company made a statement to further emphasize the fact that they take their customers' privacy and data protection very seriously, even saying that \"government snooping potentially now constitutes an 'advanced persistent threat,' alongside sophisticated malware and cyber attacks\".[207] The statement also marked the beginning of three-part program to enhance Microsoft's encryption and transparency efforts. On July 1, 2014, as part of this program they opened the first (of many) Microsoft Transparency Center, which provides \"participating governments with the ability to review source code for our key products, assure themselves of their software integrity, and confirm there are no \"back doors.\"[208] Microsoft has also argued that the United States Congress should enact strong privacy regulations to protect consumer data.[209]\n\n\nIn April 2016, the company sued the U.S. government, argued that secrecy orders were preventing the company from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company's and customers' rights. Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents and that the Fourth Amendment made it so people or businesses had the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy change by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ). The DoJ had \"changed data request rules on alerting the Internet users about agencies accessing their information.\"\n\n\n\n## Corporate identity[edit]\n\n\n### Corporate culture[edit]\n\n\nTechnical references for developers and articles for various Microsoft magazines such as *Microsoft Systems Journal* (MSJ) are available through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). MSDN also offers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer access to pre-release beta versions of Microsoft software.[210][211] In April 2004, Microsoft launched a community site for developers and users, titled Channel 9, that provides a wiki and an Internet forum.[212] Another community site that provides daily videocasts and other services, On10.net, launched on March 3, 2006.[213] Free technical support is traditionally provided through online Usenet newsgroups, and CompuServe in the past, monitored by Microsoft employees; there can be several newsgroups for a single product. Helpful people can be elected by peers or Microsoft employees for Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) status, which entitles them to a sort of special social status and possibilities for awards and other benefits.[214]\n\n\nNoted for its internal lexicon, the expression \"eating your own dog food\" is used to describe the policy of using pre-release and beta versions of products inside Microsoft in an effort to test them in \"real-world\" situations.[215] This is usually shortened to just \"dog food\" and is used as a noun, verb, and adjective. Another bit of jargon, FYIFV or FYIV (\"Fuck You, I'm [Fully] Vested\"), is used by an employee to indicate they are financially independent and can avoid work anytime they wish.[216]\n\n\nMicrosoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H-1B visas, which allows companies in the U.S. to employ certain foreign workers. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas makes it difficult to hire employees for the company, stating \"I'd certainly get rid of the H1B cap\" in 2005.[217] Critics of H1B visas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for U.S. citizens due to H1B workers working for lower salaries.[218]\n\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a report of how progressive the organization deems company policies towards LGBT employees, rated Microsoft as 87% from 2002 to 2004 and as 100% from 2005 to 2010 after they allowed gender expression.[219]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Microsoft implemented a policy for all companies providing subcontractors to require 12 weeks of paid parental leave to each employee. This expands on the former requirement from 2015 requiring 15 days of paid vacation and sick leave each year.[220] In 2015, Microsoft established its own parental leave policy to allow 12 weeks off for parental leave with an additional 8 weeks for the parent who gave birth.[221]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Greenpeace released a report rating the top ten big brands in cloud computing on their sources of electricity for their data centers. At the time, data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity, and this amount was projected to increase. Phil Radford of Greenpeace said \"we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today,\"[222] and called on \"Amazon, Microsoft and other leaders of the information-technology industry must embrace clean energy to power their cloud-based data centers.\"[223] In 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy power generated by a Texas wind project to power one of its data centers.[224] Microsoft is ranked on the 17th place in Greenpeace's *Guide to Greener Electronics* (16th Edition) that ranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to their policies on toxic chemicals, recycling, and climate change.[225] Microsoft's timeline for phasing out brominated flame retardant (BFRs) and phthalates in all products is 2012 but its commitment to phasing out PVC is not clear. As of January 2011,[update] it has no products that are completely free from PVC and BFRs.[226]\n\n\nMicrosoft's main U.S. campus received a silver certification from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program in 2008, and it installed over 2,000 solar panels on top of its buildings at its Silicon Valley campus, generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by the facilities in April 2005.[227] Microsoft makes use of alternative forms of transit. It created one of the world's largest private bus systems, the \"Connector,\" to transport people from outside the company; for on-campus transportation, the \"Shuttle Connect\" uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel. The “Connector” does not compete with the public bus system and works with it to provide a cohesive transportation network not just for its employees but also for the public.[228] The company also subsidizes regional public transport, provided by Sound Transit and King County Metro, as an incentive.[227][229] In February 2010, however, Microsoft took a stance against adding additional public transport and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to the State Route 520 and its floating bridge connecting Redmond to Seattle; the company did not want to delay the construction any further.[230] Microsoft was ranked number 1 in the list of the World's Best Multinational Workplaces by the Great Place to Work Institute in 2011.[231]\n\n\nIn January 2020, the company announced a strategy to take the company carbon negative by 2030 and to remove all carbon that it has emitted since its foundation in 1975.[232][233][234] On October 9, 2020, Microsoft permanently allowed remote work.[235] In January 2021, the company announced on Twitter to join the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, which engages the cloud infrastructure and data centers industries to reach carbon neutrality in Europe by 2030, and also disclosed an investment in Climeworks, a direct air capture company partnered with Carbfix for carbon sequestration.[list 1] In the same year, it was awarded the EPA's Green Power Leadership Award, citing the company's use of 100 percent renewable energy since 2014.[241] In September 2023, Microsoft announced that it purchased $200 million in carbon credits to offset 315,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide over 10 years from Heirloom Carbon, a carbon removal company that mixes calcium oxide from heated crushed limestone with water to form carbon hydroxide to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to mineralize back into limestone while the released carbon dioxide is stored underground or injected into concrete.[242][243]\n\n\n\n### Headquarters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The west campus of the Microsoft Redmond campus\nThe corporate headquarters, informally known as the Microsoft Redmond campus, is located at One Microsoft Way in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks before the company went public on March 13. The headquarters has since experienced multiple expansions since its establishment. It is estimated to encompass over 8 million ft2 (750,000 m2) of office space and 30,000–40,000 employees.[244] Additional offices are located in Bellevue and Issaquah, Washington (90,000 employees worldwide). The company is planning to upgrade its Mountain View, California, campus on a grand scale. The company has occupied this campus since 1981. In 2016, the company bought the 32-acre (13 ha) campus, with plans to renovate and expand it by 25%.[245] Microsoft operates an East Coast headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina,[246] where the construction of a data center led to the destruction of a historic black cemetery.[247]\n\n\n\n### Flagship stores[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Microsoft's Toronto flagship store\nOn October 26, 2015, the company opened its retail location on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The location features a five-story glass storefront and is 22,270 square feet.[248] As per company executives, Microsoft had been on the lookout for a flagship location since 2009.[249] The company's retail locations are part of a greater strategy to help build a connection with its consumers. The opening of the store coincided with the launch of the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4.[250] On November 12, 2015, Microsoft opened a second flagship store, located in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall.[251]\n\n\n\n### Logo[edit]\n\n\nMicrosoft adopted the so-called \"*Pac-Man* Logo,\" designed by Scott Baker, in 1987. Baker stated \"The new logo, in Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between the *o* and *s* to emphasize the \"soft\" part of the name and convey motion and speed.\"[252] Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter *O*, nicknamed the *blibbet*, but it was discarded.[253] Microsoft's logo with the tagline \"Your potential. Our passion.\"—below the main corporate name—is based on a slogan Microsoft used in 2008. In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United States and eventually started a television campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of *\"Where do you want to go today?\"*[254][255][256] During the private MGX (Microsoft Global Exchange) conference in 2010, Microsoft unveiled the company's next tagline, *\"Be What's Next.\"*[257] They also had a slogan/tagline \"Making it all make sense.\"[258]\n\n\nOn August 23, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new corporate logo at the opening of its 23rd Microsoft store in Boston, indicating the company's shift of focus from the classic style to the tile-centric modern interface, which it uses/will use on the Windows Phone platform, Xbox 360, Windows 8 and the upcoming Office Suites.[259] The new logo also includes four squares with the colors of the then-current Windows logo which have been used to represent Microsoft's four major products: Windows (blue), Office (orange), Xbox (green) and Bing (yellow).[260] The logo also resembles the opening of one of the commercials for Windows 95.[261][262]\n\n\n\n* Microsoft logo history\n* ![1975–1980: First Microsoft logo, in 1975](image)\n\n1975–1980: First Microsoft logo, in 1975\n* ![1980–1982: Second Microsoft logo, in 1980](image)\n\n1980–1982: Second Microsoft logo, in 1980\n* ![1982–1987: Third Microsoft logo, in 1982](image)\n\n1982–1987: Third Microsoft logo, in 1982\n* ![1987–2012: Microsoft \"Pac-Man\" logo, designed by Scott Baker and used from 1987 to 2012[254][255]](image)\n\n1987–2012: Microsoft \"Pac-Man\" logo, designed by Scott Baker and used from 1987 to 2012[254][255]\n* ![2012–present: Fifth Microsoft logo, introduced on August 23, 2012[263]](image)\n\n2012–present: Fifth Microsoft logo, introduced on August 23, 2012[263]\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![Toyota Yaris WRC.jpg](image)Toyota Yaris WRC\nThe company was the official jersey sponsor of Finland's national basketball team at EuroBasket 2015.[264]\n\n\nThe company was a major sponsor of the Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT (2017–2020).\n\n\nThe company was a sponsor of the Renault F1 Team (2016–2020).\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, announced that an initial batch of supplies, including 15,000 protection goggles, infrared thermometers, medical caps, and protective suits, was donated to Seattle, with further aid to come soon.[265]\n\n\nDuring 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Microsoft started monitoring cyberattacks originating from the Russian government and Russia-backed hackers. In June 2022, Microsoft published the report on Russian cyber attacks, and concluded that state-backed Russian hackers \"have engaged in \"strategic espionage\" against governments, think tanks, businesses and aid groups\" in 42 countries supporting Kyiv.[266][267]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Microsoft litigation and Criticism of Microsoft\n\nCriticism of Microsoft has followed various aspects of its products and business practices. Frequently criticized are the ease of use, robustness, and security of the company's software. They have also been criticized for the use of permatemp employees (employees employed for years as \"temporary,\" and therefore without medical benefits), the use of forced retention tactics, which means that employees would be sued if they tried to leave.[268] Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking employees, in many cases, leading to burnout within just a few years of joining the company. The company is often referred to as a \"Velvet Sweatshop,\" a term which originated in a 1989 *Seattle Times* article,[269] and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft's own employees.[270] This characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health.\n\n\nAs reported by several news outlets,[271][272] an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft based in the Republic of Ireland declared £220 bn in profits but paid no corporation tax for the year 2020. This is due to the company being tax resident in Bermuda as mentioned in the accounts for 'Microsoft Round Island One, a subsidiary that collects license fees from the use of Microsoft software worldwide. Dame Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP in the UK said, \"It is unsurprising – yet still shocking – that massively wealthy global corporations openly, unashamedly and blatantly refuse to pay tax on the profits they make in the countries where they undertake business\".[272]\n\n\nIn 2020, ProPublica reported that the company had diverted more than $39 billion in U.S. profits to Puerto Rico using a mechanism structured to make it seem as if the company was unprofitable on paper. As a result, the company paid a tax rate on those profits of \"nearly 0%.\" When the Internal Revenue Service audited these transactions, ProPublica reported that Microsoft aggressively fought back, including successfully lobbying Congress to change the law to make it harder for the agency to conduct audits of large corporations.[273][274]\n\n\n\"Embrace, extend, and extinguish\" (EEE),[275] also known as \"embrace, extend, and exterminate,\"[276] is a phrase that the U.S. Department of Justice found[277] that was used internally by Microsoft[278] to describe its strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those standards with proprietary capabilities, and then using those differences to strongly disadvantage competitors. Microsoft is frequently accused of using anticompetitive tactics and abusing its monopolistic power. People who use their products and services often end up becoming dependent on them, a process is known as vendor lock-in.\n\n\nMicrosoft was the first company to participate in the PRISM surveillance program, according to leaked NSA documents obtained by *The Guardian*[279] and *The Washington Post*[280] in June 2013, and acknowledged by government officials following the leak.[281] The program authorizes the government to secretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Microsoft has denied participation in such a program.[282]\n\n\nJesse Jackson believes Microsoft should hire more minorities and women. In 2015, he praised Microsoft for appointing two women to its board of directors.[283]\n\n\nIn 2020, Salesforce, the manufacturer of the Slack platform, complained to European regulators about Microsoft due to the integration of the Teams service into Office 365. Negotiations with the European Commission continued until the summer of 2023, but, as it became known to the media, they reached an impasse. Microsoft is now facing an antitrust investigation.[284]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Microsoft software\n* Microsoft hardware\n* List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft\n* Microsoft engineering groups\n* Microsoft Enterprise Agreement\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Microsoft Corporation Form 10-K\".

Microsoft's best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, and the Edge web browser. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 14 in the 2022 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue;[2] it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2022. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, and Meta.\n\n\nMicrosoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in October 2023,[3] followed by its acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[4] and its acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.[5]\n\n\nAs of 2015[update], Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.[6] The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).\n\n\nSteve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000 and later envisioned a \"devices and services\" strategy.[7] This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008,[8] entering the personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the company's shares reach their highest value since December 1999.[9][10] Under Nadella's direction, the company has also heavily expanded it's gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022, dedicated to operating Xbox in addition to it's three subsidiaries (publishers). Microsoft Gaming is the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue as of 2023.[11]\n\n\nEarlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018, Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.[12] In April 2019, Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon, respectively. As of 2023[update], Microsoft has the third-highest global brand valuation.\n\n\nMicrosoft has been criticized for its monopolistic practices and the company's software has been criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Microsoft\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Microsoft.\n\n### 1972–1985: Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An Altair 8800 computer (left) with the popular Model 33 ASR Teletype as terminal, paper tape reader, and paper tape punch\n![](image)Paul Allen and Bill Gates on October 19, 1981, after signing a pivotal contract with IBM[13]: 228\n![](image)Bill Gates and Paul Allen's Original Business Cards located in the Microsoft Visitor Center.\nChildhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen sought to make a business using their skills in computer programming.[14] In 1972, they founded Traf-O-Data, which sold a rudimentary computer to track and analyze automobile traffic data. Gates enrolled at Harvard University while Allen pursued a degree in computer science at Washington State University, though he later dropped out to work at Honeywell.[15] The January 1975 issue of *Popular Electronics* featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems's (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer,[16] which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device. Gates called MITS and claimed that he had a working interpreter, and MITS requested a demonstration. Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter, and it worked flawlessly when they demonstrated it to MITS in March 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC.[13]: 108, 112–114 Gates and Allen established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as CEO,[17] and Allen suggested the name \"Micro-Soft,\" short for micro-computer software.[18][19] In August 1977, the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office of ASCII Microsoft.[20] Microsoft moved its headquarters to Bellevue, Washington, in January 1979.[17]\n\n\nMicrosoft entered the operating system (OS) business in 1980 with its own version of Unix called Xenix,[21] but it was MS-DOS that solidified the company's dominance. IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS to be used in the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC).[22] For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products which it branded as MS-DOS, although IBM rebranded it to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981. IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, so other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor.[23][24]: 210 The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as with a publishing division named Microsoft Press.[13]: 232\nPaul Allen resigned from Microsoft in 1983 after developing Hodgkin's lymphoma.[25] Allen claimed in *Idea Man: A Memoir by the Co-founder of Microsoft* that Gates wanted to dilute his share in the company when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease because he did not think that he was working hard enough.[26] Allen later invested in low-tech sectors, sports teams, commercial real estate, neuroscience, private space flight, and more.[27]\n\n\n\n### 1985–1994: Windows and Office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Windows 1.0 was released on November 20, 1985, as the first version of the Windows line.\nMicrosoft released Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical extension for MS-DOS,[13]: 242–243, 246 despite having begun jointly developing OS/2 with IBM the previous August.[28] Microsoft moved its headquarters from Bellevue to Redmond, Washington, on February 26, 1986, and went public on March 13,[29] with the resulting rise in stock making an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.[30] Microsoft released its version of OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987.[13] In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission examined Microsoft for possible collusion due to the partnership with IBM, marking the beginning of more than a decade of legal clashes with the government.[31] : 243–244 Meanwhile, the company was at work on Microsoft Windows NT, which was heavily based on their copy of the OS/2 code. It shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and the 32-bit Win32 application programming interface (API), making it easier to port from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based) Windows. Microsoft informed IBM of Windows NT, and the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.[32]\n\n\nIn 1990, Microsoft introduced the Microsoft Office suite which bundled separate applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.[13]: 301 On May 22, Microsoft launched Windows 3.0, featuring streamlined user interface graphics and improved protected mode capability for the Intel 386 processor,[33] and both Office and Windows became dominant in their respective areas.[34][35]\n\n\nOn July 27, 1994, the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division filed a competitive impact statement that said: \"Beginning in 1988 and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti-competitive 'per processor licenses. Under a per-processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM's use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft's use of per processor licenses has increased.\"[36]\n\n\n\n### 1995–2007: Foray into the Web, Windows 95, Windows XP, and Xbox[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 1996, Microsoft released Windows CE, a version of the operating system meant for personal digital assistants and other tiny computers, shown here on the HP 300LX.\nFollowing Bill Gates's internal \"Internet Tidal Wave memo\" on May 26, 1995, Microsoft began to redefine its offerings and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web.[37] With a few exceptions of new companies, like Netscape, Microsoft was the only major and established company that acted fast enough to be a part of the World Wide Web practically from the start. Other companies like Borland, WordPerfect, Novell, IBM and Lotus, being much slower to adapt to the new situation, would give Microsoft market dominance.[38] The company released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, featuring pre-emptive multitasking, a completely new user interface with a novel start button, and 32-bit compatibility; similar to NT, it provided the Win32 API.[39][40]: 20 Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN, which was at first intended to be a competitor to the Internet,[*dubious – discuss*] and (for OEMs) Internet Explorer, a Web browser. Internet Explorer has not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes, because the boxes were printed before the team finished the Web browser, and instead were included in the Windows 95 Plus! pack.[41] Backed by a high-profile marketing campaign[42] and what *The New York Times* called \"the splashiest, most frenzied, most expensive introduction of a computer product in the industry's history,\"[43] Windows 95 quickly became a success.[44] Branching out into new markets in 1996, Microsoft and General Electric's NBC unit created a new 24/7 cable news channel, MSNBC.[45] Microsoft created Windows CE 1.0, a new OS designed for devices with low memory and other constraints, such as personal digital assistants.[46] In October 1997, the Justice Department filed a motion in the Federal District Court, stating that Microsoft violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.[13]: 323–324\n\n\n\n![](image)Microsoft released the first installment in the Xbox series of consoles in 2001. The Xbox, graphically powerful compared to its rivals, featured a standard PC's 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor.\nOn January 13, 2000, Bill Gates handed over the CEO position to Steve Ballmer, an old college friend of Gates and employee of the company since 1980, while creating a new position for himself as Chief Software Architect.[13]: 111, 228[17] Various companies including Microsoft formed the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance in October 1999 to (among other things) increase security and protect intellectual property through identifying changes in hardware and software. Critics decried the alliance as a way to enforce indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and over how computers behave, and as a form of digital rights management: for example, the scenario where a computer is not only secured for its owner but also secured against its owner as well.[47][48] On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of *United States v. Microsoft Corp.*,[49] calling the company an \"abusive monopoly.\"[50] Microsoft later settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2004.[29] On October 25, 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP, unifying the mainstream and NT lines of OS under the NT codebase.[51] The company released the Xbox later that year, entering the video game console market dominated by Sony and Nintendo.[52] In March 2004 the European Union brought antitrust legal action against the company, citing it abused its dominance with the Windows OS, resulting in a judgment of €497 million ($613 million) and requiring Microsoft to produce new versions of Windows XP without Windows Media Player: Windows XP Home Edition N and Windows XP Professional N.[53][54] In November 2005, the company's second video game console, the Xbox 360, was released. There were two versions, a basic version for $299.99 and a deluxe version for $399.99.[55]\n\n\nIncreasingly present in the hardware business following Xbox, Microsoft 2006 released the Zune series of digital media players, a successor of its previous software platform Portable Media Center. These expanded on previous hardware commitments from Microsoft following its original Microsoft Mouse in 1983; as of 2007 the company sold the best-selling wired keyboard (Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000), mouse (IntelliMouse), and desktop webcam (LifeCam) in the United States. That year the company also launched the Surface \"digital table\", later renamed PixelSense.[56]\n\n\n\n### 2007–2011: Microsoft Azure, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Microsoft Stores[edit]\n\n\n![](image)CEO Steve Ballmer at the MIX event in 2008. In an interview about his management style in 2005, he mentioned that his first priority was to get the people he delegates to in order. Ballmer also emphasized the need to continue pursuing new technologies even if initial attempts fail, citing the original attempts with Windows as an example.[57]\n![](image)Headquarters of the European Commission, which has imposed several fines on Microsoft\nReleased in January 2007, the next version of Windows, Vista, focused on features, security and a redesigned user interface dubbed Aero.[58][59] Microsoft Office 2007, released at the same time, featured a \"Ribbon\" user interface which was a significant departure from its predecessors. Relatively strong sales of both products helped to produce a record profit in 2007.[60] The European Union imposed another fine of €899 million ($1.4 billion) for Microsoft's lack of compliance with the March 2004 judgment on February 27, 2008, saying that the company charged rivals unreasonable prices for key information about its workgroup and backoffice servers.[61] Microsoft stated that it was in compliance and that \"these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved\".[62] 2007 also saw the creation of a multi-core unit at Microsoft, following the steps of server companies such as Sun and IBM.[63]\n\n\nGates retired from his role as Chief Software Architect on June 27, 2008, a decision announced in June 2006, while retaining other positions related to the company in addition to being an advisor for the company on key projects.[64][65] Azure Services Platform, the company's entry into the cloud computing market for Windows, launched on October 27, 2008.[66] On February 12, 2009, Microsoft announced its intent to open a chain of Microsoft-branded retail stores, and on October 22, 2009, the first retail Microsoft Store opened in Scottsdale, Arizona; the same day Windows 7 was officially released to the public. Windows 7's focus was on refining Vista with ease-of-use features and performance enhancements, rather than an extensive reworking of Windows.[67][68][69]\n\n\nAs the smartphone industry boomed in the late 2000s, Microsoft had struggled to keep up with its rivals in providing a modern smartphone operating system, falling behind Apple and Google-sponsored Android in the United States.[70] As a result, in 2010 Microsoft revamped their aging flagship mobile operating system, Windows Mobile, replacing it with the new Windows Phone OS that was released in October that year.[71][72] It used a new user interface design language, codenamed \"Metro,\" which prominently used simple shapes, typography, and iconography, utilizing the concept of minimalism. Microsoft implemented a new strategy for the software industry, providing a consistent user experience across all smartphones using the Windows Phone OS. It launched an alliance with Nokia in 2011 and Microsoft worked closely with the company to co-develop Windows Phone,[73] but remained partners with long-time Windows Mobile OEM HTC.[74] Microsoft is a founding member of the Open Networking Foundation started on March 23, 2011. Fellow founders were Google, HP Networking, Yahoo!, Verizon Communications, Deutsche Telekom and 17 other companies. This nonprofit organization is focused on providing support for a cloud computing initiative called Software-Defined Networking.[75] The initiative is meant to speed innovation through simple software changes in telecommunications networks, wireless networks, data centers, and other networking areas.[76]\n\n\n\n### 2011–2014: Windows 8/8.1, Xbox One, Outlook.com, and Surface devices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Surface Pro 3, part of the Surface series of laplets by Microsoft\nFollowing the release of Windows Phone, Microsoft undertook a gradual rebranding of its product range throughout 2011 and 2012, with the corporation's logos, products, services, and websites adopting the principles and concepts of the Metro design language.[77] Microsoft unveiled Windows 8, an operating system designed to power both personal computers and tablet computers, in Taipei in June 2011.[78] A developer preview was released on September 13, which was subsequently replaced by a consumer preview on February 29, 2012, and released to the public in May.[79] The Surface was unveiled on June 18, becoming the first computer in the company's history to have its hardware made by Microsoft.[80][81] On June 25, Microsoft paid US$1.2 billion to buy the social network Yammer.[82] On July 31, they launched the Outlook.com webmail service to compete with Gmail.[83] On September 4, 2012, Microsoft released Windows Server 2012.[84]\n\n\nIn July 2012, Microsoft sold its 50% stake in MSNBC, which it had run as a joint venture with NBC since 1996.[85] On October 1, Microsoft announced its intention to launch a news operation, part of a new-look MSN, with Windows 8 later in the month.[86] On October 26, 2012, Microsoft launched Windows 8 and the Microsoft Surface.[81][87] Three days later, Windows Phone 8 was launched.[88] To cope with the potential for an increase in demand for products and services, Microsoft opened a number of \"holiday stores\" across the U.S. to complement the increasing number of \"bricks-and-mortar\" Microsoft Stores that opened in 2012.[89] On March 29, 2013, Microsoft launched a Patent Tracker.[90]\n\n\nIn August 2012, the New York City Police Department announced a partnership with Microsoft for the development of the Domain Awareness System which is used for Police surveillance in New York City.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Xbox One console, released in 2013\nThe Kinect, a motion-sensing input device made by Microsoft and designed as a video game controller, first introduced in November 2010, was upgraded for the 2013 release of the Xbox One video game console. Kinect's capabilities were revealed in May 2013: an ultra-wide 1080p camera, function in the dark due to an infrared sensor, higher-end processing power and new software, the ability to distinguish between fine movements (such as a thumb movement), and determining a user's heart rate by looking at their face.[92] Microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers as part of a plan to make the viewing experience more interactive. On July 19, 2013, Microsoft stocks suffered their biggest one-day percentage sell-off since the year 2000, after its fourth-quarter report raised concerns among investors on the poor showings of both Windows 8 and the Surface tablet. Microsoft suffered a loss of more than US$32 billion.[93]\n\n\nIn line with the maturing PC business, in July 2013, Microsoft announced that it would reorganize the business into four new business divisions, namely Operating systems, Apps, Cloud, and Devices. All previous divisions will be dissolved into new divisions without any workforce cuts.[94] On September 3, 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy Nokia's mobile unit for $7 billion,[95] following Amy Hood taking the role of CFO.[96]\n\n\n\n\n### 2014–2020: Windows 10, Microsoft Edge, and HoloLens[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satya Nadella succeeded Steve Ballmer as the CEO of Microsoft in February 2014.\nOn February 4, 2014, Steve Ballmer stepped down as CEO of Microsoft and was succeeded by Satya Nadella, who previously led Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise division.[97] On the same day, John W. Thompson took on the role of chairman, in place of Bill Gates, who continued to participate as a technology advisor.[98] Thompson became the second chairman in Microsoft's history.[99] On April 25, 2014, Microsoft acquired Nokia Devices and Services for $7.2 billion.[100] This new subsidiary was renamed Microsoft Mobile Oy.[101] On September 15, 2014, Microsoft acquired the video game development company Mojang, best known for *Minecraft*, for $2.5 billion.[102] On June 8, 2017, Microsoft acquired Hexadite, an Israeli security firm, for $100 million.[103][104]\n\n\nOn January 21, 2015, Microsoft announced the release of their first Interactive whiteboard, Microsoft Surface Hub.[105] On July 29, 2015, Windows 10 was released,[106] with its server sibling, Windows Server 2016, released in September 2016. In Q1 2015, Microsoft was the third largest maker of mobile phones, selling 33 million units (7.2% of all). While a large majority (at least 75%) of them do not run any version of Windows Phone— those other phones are not categorized as smartphones by Gartner – in the same time frame 8 million Windows smartphones (2.5% of all smartphones) were made by all manufacturers (but mostly by Microsoft).[107] Microsoft's share of the U.S. smartphone market in January 2016 was 2.7%.[108] During the summer of 2015 the company lost $7.6 billion related to its mobile-phone business, firing 7,800 employees.[109]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2016, Microsoft announced the merger of its PC and Xbox divisions, with Phil Spencer announcing that Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps would be the focus for Microsoft's gaming in the future.[110] On January 24, 2017, Microsoft showcased Intune for Education at the BETT 2017 education technology conference in London.[111] Intune for Education is a new cloud-based application and device management service for the education sector.[112] In May 2016, the company announced it was laying off 1,850 workers, and taking an impairment and restructuring charge of $950 million.[109] In June 2016, Microsoft announced a project named Microsoft Azure Information Protection. It aims to help enterprises protect their data as it moves between servers and devices.[113] In November 2016, Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member during Microsoft's Connect(); developer event in New York.[114] The cost of each Platinum membership is US$500,000 per year.[115] Some analysts deemed this unthinkable ten years prior, however, as in 2001 then-CEO Steve Ballmer called Linux \"cancer\".[116] Microsoft planned to launch a preview of Intune for Education \"in the coming weeks,\" with general availability scheduled for spring 2017, priced at $30 per device, or through volume licensing agreements.[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Nokia Lumia 1320, the Microsoft Lumia 535 and the Nokia Lumia 530, which all run on one of the now-discontinued Windows Phone operating systems\nIn January 2018, Microsoft patched Windows 10 to account for CPU problems related to Intel's Meltdown security breach. The patch led to issues with the Microsoft Azure virtual machines reliant on Intel's CPU architecture. On January 12, Microsoft released PowerShell Core 6.0 for the macOS and Linux operating systems.[118] In February 2018, Microsoft killed notification support for their Windows Phone devices which effectively ended firmware updates for the discontinued devices.[118] In March 2018, Microsoft recalled Windows 10 S to change it to a mode for the Windows operating system rather than a separate and unique operating system. In March the company also established guidelines that censor users of Office 365 from using profanity in private documents.[118] In April 2018, Microsoft released the source code for Windows File Manager under the MIT License to celebrate the program's 20th anniversary. In April the company further expressed willingness to embrace open source initiatives by announcing Azure Sphere as its own derivative of the Linux operating system.[118] In May 2018, Microsoft partnered with 17 American intelligence agencies to develop cloud computing products. The project is dubbed \"Azure Government\" and has ties to the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) surveillance program.[118] On June 4, 2018, Microsoft officially announced the acquisition of GitHub for $7.5 billion, a deal that closed on October 26, 2018.[119][120] On July 10, 2018, Microsoft revealed the Surface Go platform to the public. Later in the month, it converted Microsoft Teams to gratis.[118] In August 2018, Microsoft released two projects called Microsoft AccountGuard and Defending Democracy. It also unveiled Snapdragon 850 compatibility for Windows 10 on the ARM architecture.[121][122][118]\n\n\n\n![](image)Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin using a Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality headset in September 2016\nIn August 2018, Toyota Tsusho began a partnership with Microsoft to create fish farming tools using the Microsoft Azure application suite for Internet of things (IoT) technologies related to water management. Developed in part by researchers from Kindai University, the water pump mechanisms use artificial intelligence to count the number of fish on a conveyor belt, analyze the number of fish, and deduce the effectiveness of water flow from the data the fish provide. The specific computer programs used in the process fall under the Azure Machine Learning and the Azure IoT Hub platforms.[123] In September 2018, Microsoft discontinued Skype Classic.[118] On October 10, 2018, Microsoft joined the Open Invention Network community despite holding more than 60,000 patents.[124] In November 2018, Microsoft agreed to supply 100,000 Microsoft HoloLens headsets to the United States military in order to \"increase lethality by enhancing the ability to detect, decide and engage before the enemy.\"[125] In November 2018, Microsoft introduced Azure Multi-Factor Authentication for Microsoft Azure.[126] In December 2018, Microsoft announced Project Mu, an open source release of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) core used in Microsoft Surface and Hyper-V products. The project promotes the idea of Firmware as a Service.[127] In the same month, Microsoft announced the open source implementation of Windows Forms and the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) which will allow for further movement of the company toward the transparent release of key frameworks used in developing Windows desktop applications and software. December also saw the company discontinue the Microsoft Edge project in favor of Chromium backends for their browsers.[126]\n\n\nOn February 20, 2019, Microsoft Corp said it will offer its cyber security service AccountGuard to 12 new markets in Europe including Germany, France and Spain, to close security gaps and protect customers in political space from hacking.[128] In February 2019, hundreds of Microsoft employees protested the company's war profiteering from a $480 million contract to develop virtual reality headsets for the United States Army.[129]\n\n\n\n### 2020–present: Acquisitions, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows 11[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft\n\nOn March 26, 2020, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Affirmed Networks for about $1.35 billion.[130][131] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft closed all of its retail stores indefinitely due to health concerns.[132] On July 22, 2020, Microsoft announced plans to close its Mixer service, planning to move existing partners to Facebook Gaming.[133]\n\n\nOn July 31, 2020, it was reported that Microsoft was in talks to acquire TikTok after the Trump administration ordered ByteDance to divest ownership of the application to the U.S.[134] On August 3, 2020, after speculation on the deal, Donald Trump stated that Microsoft could buy the application, however, it should be completed by September 15, 2020, and that the United States Department of the Treasury should receive a portion if it were to go through.[135]\n\n\nOn August 5, 2020, Microsoft stopped its xCloud game streaming test for iOS devices. According to Microsoft, the future of xCloud on iOS remains unclear and potentially out of Microsoft's hands. Apple has imposed a strict limit on \"remote desktop clients\" which means applications are only allowed to connect to a user-owned host device or gaming console owned by the user.[136] On September 21, 2020, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire video game company ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, for about $7.5 billion, with the deal expected to occur in the second half of 2021 fiscal year.[137] On March 9, 2021, the acquisition was finalized and ZeniMax Media became part of Microsoft's Xbox Game Studios division.[138] The total price of the deal was $8.1 billion.[139]\n\n\nOn September 22, 2020, Microsoft announced that it had an exclusive license to use OpenAI's GPT-3 artificial intelligence language generator.[140] The previous version of GPT-3, called GPT-2, made headlines for being \"too dangerous to release\" and had numerous capabilities, including designing websites, prescribing medication, answering questions, and penning articles.[141] On November 10, 2020, Microsoft released the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S video game consoles.[142]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Microsoft announced it would buy Nuance Communications for approximately $16 billion.[143] The acquisition of Nuance was completed in March 2022.[144] In 2021, in part due to the strong quarterly earnings spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft's valuation came to nearly $2 trillion. The increased necessity for remote work and distance education drove demand for cloud computing and grew the company's gaming sales.[145][146][147]\n\n\nOn June 24, 2021, Microsoft announced Windows 11 during a Livestream. The announcement came with confusion after Microsoft announced Windows 10 would be the last version of the operating system; set to be released in the third quarter of 2021.[148] It was released to the general public on October 5, 2021.[149]\n\n\nIn early September 2021, it was announced that the company had acquired Takelessons, an online platform which connects students and tutors in numerous subjects. The acquisition positioned Microsoft to grow its presence in the market of providing online education to large numbers of people.[150] In the same month, Microsoft acquired Australia-based video editing software company Clipchamp.[151]\n\n\nIn October 2021, Microsoft announced that it began rolling out end-to-end encryption (E2EE) support for Microsoft Teams calls in order to secure business communication while using video conferencing software.

Stanton, John W. Thompson, Emma Walmsley and Padmasree Warrior.[164] Board members are elected every year at the annual shareholders' meeting using a majority vote system. There are four committees within the board that oversee more specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues with the company including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters including the nomination of the board; and the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee, which includes legal/antitrust matters, along with privacy, trade, digital safety, artificial intelligence, and environmental sustainability.[165]\n\n\nOn March 13, 2020, Gates announced that he is leaving the board of directors of Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus more on his philanthropic efforts. According to Aaron Tilley of *The Wall Street Journal* this is \"marking the biggest boardroom departure in the tech industry since the death of longtime rival and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs.\"[166]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft's board of directors plans to hire an external law firm to review its sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, and to release a summary of how the company handled past allegations of misconduct against Bill Gates and other corporate executives.[167]\n\n\n\n### Chief executives[edit]\n\n\n1.

As of July 2010, with the company's nine stock splits, any IPO shares would be multiplied by 288; if one were to buy the IPO today, given the splits and other factors, it would cost about 9 cents.[13]: 235–236[169][170] The stock price peaked in 1999 at around $119 ($60.928, adjusting for splits).[171] The company began to offer a dividend on January 16, 2003, starting at eight cents per share for the fiscal year followed by a dividend of sixteen cents per share the subsequent year, switching from yearly to quarterly dividends in 2005 with eight cents a share per quarter and a special one-time payout of three dollars per share for the second quarter of the fiscal year.[171][172] Though the company had subsequent increases in dividend payouts, the price of Microsoft's stock remained steady for years.[172][173]\n\n\nStandard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service have both given a AAA rating to Microsoft, whose assets were valued at $41 billion as compared to only $8.5 billion in unsecured debt. Consequently, in February 2011 Microsoft released a corporate bond amounting to $2.25 billion with relatively low borrowing rates compared to government bonds.[174] For the first time in 20 years Apple Inc. surpassed Microsoft in Q1 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge losses in Microsoft's Online Services Division (which contains its search engine Bing). Microsoft profits were $5.2 billion, while Apple Inc. profits were $6 billion, on revenues of $14.5 billion and $24.7 billion respectively.[175] Microsoft's Online Services Division has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and in Q1 2011 it lost $726 million. This follows a loss of $2.5 billion for the year 2010.[176]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2012, Microsoft posted its first quarterly loss ever, despite earning record revenues for the quarter and fiscal year, with a net loss of $492 million due to a writedown related to the advertising company aQuantive, which had been acquired for $6.2 billion back in 2007.[177] As of January 2014, Microsoft's market capitalization stood at $314B,[178] making it the 8th largest company in the world by market capitalization.[179] On November 14, 2014, Microsoft overtook ExxonMobil to become the second most-valuable company by market capitalization, behind only Apple Inc. Its total market value was over $410B—with the stock price hitting $50.04 a share, the highest since early 2000.[180] In 2015, Reuters reported that Microsoft Corp had earnings abroad of $76.4 billion which were untaxed by the Internal Revenue Service. Under U.S. law, corporations do not pay income tax on overseas profits until the profits are brought into the United States.[181]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenuein mil. US$[182] | Net incomein mil.

The two-year contract may result in follow-on orders of more than 100,000 headsets, according to documentation describing the bidding process. One of the contract's tag lines for the augmented reality technology seems to be its ability to enable \"25 bloodless battles before the 1st battle,\" suggesting that actual combat training is going to be an essential aspect of the augmented reality headset capabilities.[184]\n\n\n\n### Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nMicrosoft is an international business. As such, it needs subsidiaries present in whatever national markets it chooses to harvest. An example is Microsoft Canada, which it established in 1985.[185] Other countries have similar installations, to funnel profits back up to Redmond and to distribute the dividends to the holders of MSFT stock.\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Windows 8 Launch Event in Akihabara, Tokyo on October 25, 2012\nIn 2004, Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of Windows Server 2003 to Linux; the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux, thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company (i.e. lower TCO).[186] This spurred a wave of related studies; a study by the Yankee Group concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from Windows Server to Linux, although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using Microsoft products.[187] Another study, released by the Open Source Development Labs, claimed that the Microsoft studies were \"simply outdated and one-sided\" and their survey concluded that the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons.[188]\n\n\nAs part of the \"Get the Facts\" campaign, Microsoft highlighted the .NET Framework trading platform that it had developed in partnership with Accenture for the London Stock Exchange, claiming that it provided \"five nines\" reliability. After suffering extended downtime and unreliability[189][190] the London Stock Exchange announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a Linux-based one in 2010.[191][192]\n\n\nIn 2012, Microsoft hired a political pollster named Mark Penn, whom *The New York Times* called \"famous for bulldozing\" his political opponents[193] as Executive Vice-president, Advertising and Strategy. Penn created a series of negative advertisements targeting one of Microsoft's chief competitors, Google. The advertisements, called \"Scroogled,\" attempt to make the case that Google is \"screwing\" consumers with search results rigged to favor Google's paid advertisers, that Gmail violates the privacy of its users to place ad results related to the content of their emails and shopping results, which favor Google products. Tech publications like TechCrunch have been highly critical of the advertising campaign,[194] while Google employees have embraced it.[195]\n\n\n\n### Layoffs[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2014, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees. Microsoft employed 127,104 people as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft lay off ever. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft had eliminated 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with the Great Recession of 2008–2017.[196][197] In September 2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle–Redmond area, where the company is headquartered. The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously announced. This brought the total number to over 15,000 out of the 18,000 expected cuts.[198] In October 2014, Microsoft revealed that it was almost done with the elimination of 18,000 employees, which was its largest-ever layoff sweep.[199] In July 2015, Microsoft announced another 7,800 job cuts in the next several months.[200] In May 2016, Microsoft announced another 1,850 job cuts mostly in its Nokia mobile phone division. As a result, the company will record an impairment and restructuring charge of approximately $950 million, of which approximately $200 million will relate to severance payments.[201]\n\n\n\n### United States government[edit]\n\n\nMicrosoft provides information about reported bugs in their software to intelligence agencies of the United States government, prior to the public release of the fix. A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that the corporation runs several programs that facilitate the sharing of such information with the U.S. government.[202] Following media reports about PRISM, NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in May 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Microsoft.[203] According to leaks of said program, Microsoft joined the PRISM program in 2007.[204] However, in June 2013, an official statement from Microsoft flatly denied their participation in the program: \n\n\n> \"We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so, and never on a voluntary basis. In addition, we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data, we don't participate in it.\"[205]\n> \n> \n\n\nDuring the first six months of 2013, Microsoft received requests that affected between 15,000 and 15,999 accounts.[206] In December 2013, the company made a statement to further emphasize the fact that they take their customers' privacy and data protection very seriously, even saying that \"government snooping potentially now constitutes an 'advanced persistent threat,' alongside sophisticated malware and cyber attacks\".[207] The statement also marked the beginning of three-part program to enhance Microsoft's encryption and transparency efforts. On July 1, 2014, as part of this program they opened the first (of many) Microsoft Transparency Center, which provides \"participating governments with the ability to review source code for our key products, assure themselves of their software integrity, and confirm there are no \"back doors.\"[208] Microsoft has also argued that the United States Congress should enact strong privacy regulations to protect consumer data.[209]\n\n\nIn April 2016, the company sued the U.S. government, argued that secrecy orders were preventing the company from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company's and customers' rights. Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents and that the Fourth Amendment made it so people or businesses had the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy change by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ). The DoJ had \"changed data request rules on alerting the Internet users about agencies accessing their information.\"\n\n\n\n## Corporate identity[edit]\n\n\n### Corporate culture[edit]\n\n\nTechnical references for developers and articles for various Microsoft magazines such as *Microsoft Systems Journal* (MSJ) are available through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). MSDN also offers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer access to pre-release beta versions of Microsoft software.[210][211] In April 2004, Microsoft launched a community site for developers and users, titled Channel 9, that provides a wiki and an Internet forum.[212] Another community site that provides daily videocasts and other services, On10.net, launched on March 3, 2006.[213] Free technical support is traditionally provided through online Usenet newsgroups, and CompuServe in the past, monitored by Microsoft employees; there can be several newsgroups for a single product. Helpful people can be elected by peers or Microsoft employees for Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) status, which entitles them to a sort of special social status and possibilities for awards and other benefits.[214]\n\n\nNoted for its internal lexicon, the expression \"eating your own dog food\" is used to describe the policy of using pre-release and beta versions of products inside Microsoft in an effort to test them in \"real-world\" situations.[215] This is usually shortened to just \"dog food\" and is used as a noun, verb, and adjective. Another bit of jargon, FYIFV or FYIV (\"Fuck You, I'm [Fully] Vested\"), is used by an employee to indicate they are financially independent and can avoid work anytime they wish.[216]\n\n\nMicrosoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H-1B visas, which allows companies in the U.S. to employ certain foreign workers. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas makes it difficult to hire employees for the company, stating \"I'd certainly get rid of the H1B cap\" in 2005.[217] Critics of H1B visas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for U.S. citizens due to H1B workers working for lower salaries.[218]\n\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a report of how progressive the organization deems company policies towards LGBT employees, rated Microsoft as 87% from 2002 to 2004 and as 100% from 2005 to 2010 after they allowed gender expression.[219]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Microsoft implemented a policy for all companies providing subcontractors to require 12 weeks of paid parental leave to each employee. This expands on the former requirement from 2015 requiring 15 days of paid vacation and sick leave each year.[220] In 2015, Microsoft established its own parental leave policy to allow 12 weeks off for parental leave with an additional 8 weeks for the parent who gave birth.[221]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Greenpeace released a report rating the top ten big brands in cloud computing on their sources of electricity for their data centers. At the time, data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity, and this amount was projected to increase. Phil Radford of Greenpeace said \"we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today,\"[222] and called on \"Amazon, Microsoft and other leaders of the information-technology industry must embrace clean energy to power their cloud-based data centers.\"[223] In 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy power generated by a Texas wind project to power one of its data centers.[224] Microsoft is ranked on the 17th place in Greenpeace's *Guide to Greener Electronics* (16th Edition) that ranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to their policies on toxic chemicals, recycling, and climate change.[225] Microsoft's timeline for phasing out brominated flame retardant (BFRs) and phthalates in all products is 2012 but its commitment to phasing out PVC is not clear. As of January 2011,[update] it has no products that are completely free from PVC and BFRs.[226]\n\n\nMicrosoft's main U.S. campus received a silver certification from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program in 2008, and it installed over 2,000 solar panels on top of its buildings at its Silicon Valley campus, generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by the facilities in April 2005.[227] Microsoft makes use of alternative forms of transit. It created one of the world's largest private bus systems, the \"Connector,\" to transport people from outside the company; for on-campus transportation, the \"Shuttle Connect\" uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel. The “Connector” does not compete with the public bus system and works with it to provide a cohesive transportation network not just for its employees but also for the public.[228] The company also subsidizes regional public transport, provided by Sound Transit and King County Metro, as an incentive.[227][229] In February 2010, however, Microsoft took a stance against adding additional public transport and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to the State Route 520 and its floating bridge connecting Redmond to Seattle; the company did not want to delay the construction any further.[230] Microsoft was ranked number 1 in the list of the World's Best Multinational Workplaces by the Great Place to Work Institute in 2011.[231]\n\n\nIn January 2020, the company announced a strategy to take the company carbon negative by 2030 and to remove all carbon that it has emitted since its foundation in 1975.[232][233][234] On October 9, 2020, Microsoft permanently allowed remote work.[235] In January 2021, the company announced on Twitter to join the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, which engages the cloud infrastructure and data centers industries to reach carbon neutrality in Europe by 2030, and also disclosed an investment in Climeworks, a direct air capture company partnered with Carbfix for carbon sequestration.[list 1] In the same year, it was awarded the EPA's Green Power Leadership Award, citing the company's use of 100 percent renewable energy since 2014.[241] In September 2023, Microsoft announced that it purchased $200 million in carbon credits to offset 315,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide over 10 years from Heirloom Carbon, a carbon removal company that mixes calcium oxide from heated crushed limestone with water to form carbon hydroxide to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to mineralize back into limestone while the released carbon dioxide is stored underground or injected into concrete.[242][243]\n\n\n\n### Headquarters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The west campus of the Microsoft Redmond campus\nThe corporate headquarters, informally known as the Microsoft Redmond campus, is located at One Microsoft Way in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks before the company went public on March 13. The headquarters has since experienced multiple expansions since its establishment. It is estimated to encompass over 8 million ft2 (750,000 m2) of office space and 30,000–40,000 employees.[244] Additional offices are located in Bellevue and Issaquah, Washington (90,000 employees worldwide). The company is planning to upgrade its Mountain View, California, campus on a grand scale. The company has occupied this campus since 1981. In 2016, the company bought the 32-acre (13 ha) campus, with plans to renovate and expand it by 25%.[245] Microsoft operates an East Coast headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina,[246] where the construction of a data center led to the destruction of a historic black cemetery.[247]\n\n\n\n### Flagship stores[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Microsoft's Toronto flagship store\nOn October 26, 2015, the company opened its retail location on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The location features a five-story glass storefront and is 22,270 square feet.[248] As per company executives, Microsoft had been on the lookout for a flagship location since 2009.[249] The company's retail locations are part of a greater strategy to help build a connection with its consumers. The opening of the store coincided with the launch of the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4.[250] On November 12, 2015, Microsoft opened a second flagship store, located in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall.[251]\n\n\n\n### Logo[edit]\n\n\nMicrosoft adopted the so-called \"*Pac-Man* Logo,\" designed by Scott Baker, in 1987. Baker stated \"The new logo, in Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between the *o* and *s* to emphasize the \"soft\" part of the name and convey motion and speed.\"[252] Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter *O*, nicknamed the *blibbet*, but it was discarded.[253] Microsoft's logo with the tagline \"Your potential. Our passion.\"—below the main corporate name—is based on a slogan Microsoft used in 2008. In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United States and eventually started a television campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of *\"Where do you want to go today?\"*[254][255][256] During the private MGX (Microsoft Global Exchange) conference in 2010, Microsoft unveiled the company's next tagline, *\"Be What's Next.\"*[257] They also had a slogan/tagline \"Making it all make sense.\"[258]\n\n\nOn August 23, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new corporate logo at the opening of its 23rd Microsoft store in Boston, indicating the company's shift of focus from the classic style to the tile-centric modern interface, which it uses/will use on the Windows Phone platform, Xbox 360, Windows 8 and the upcoming Office Suites.[259] The new logo also includes four squares with the colors of the then-current Windows logo which have been used to represent Microsoft's four major products: Windows (blue), Office (orange), Xbox (green) and Bing (yellow).[260] The logo also resembles the opening of one of the commercials for Windows 95.[261][262]\n\n\n\n* Microsoft logo history\n* ![1975–1980: First Microsoft logo, in 1975](image)\n\n1975–1980: First Microsoft logo, in 1975\n* ![1980–1982: Second Microsoft logo, in 1980](image)\n\n1980–1982: Second Microsoft logo, in 1980\n* ![1982–1987: Third Microsoft logo, in 1982](image)\n\n1982–1987: Third Microsoft logo, in 1982\n* ![1987–2012: Microsoft \"Pac-Man\" logo, designed by Scott Baker and used from 1987 to 2012[254][255]](image)\n\n1987–2012: Microsoft \"Pac-Man\" logo, designed by Scott Baker and used from 1987 to 2012[254][255]\n* ![2012–present: Fifth Microsoft logo, introduced on August 23, 2012[263]](image)\n\n2012–present: Fifth Microsoft logo, introduced on August 23, 2012[263]\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![Toyota Yaris WRC.jpg](image)Toyota Yaris WRC\nThe company was the official jersey sponsor of Finland's national basketball team at EuroBasket 2015.[264]\n\n\nThe company was a major sponsor of the Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT (2017–2020).\n\n\nThe company was a sponsor of the Renault F1 Team (2016–2020).\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, announced that an initial batch of supplies, including 15,000 protection goggles, infrared thermometers, medical caps, and protective suits, was donated to Seattle, with further aid to come soon.[265]\n\n\nDuring 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Microsoft started monitoring cyberattacks originating from the Russian government and Russia-backed hackers. In June 2022, Microsoft published the report on Russian cyber attacks, and concluded that state-backed Russian hackers \"have engaged in \"strategic espionage\" against governments, think tanks, businesses and aid groups\" in 42 countries supporting Kyiv.[266][267]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Microsoft litigation and Criticism of Microsoft\n\nCriticism of Microsoft has followed various aspects of its products and business practices. Frequently criticized are the ease of use, robustness, and security of the company's software. They have also been criticized for the use of permatemp employees (employees employed for years as \"temporary,\" and therefore without medical benefits), the use of forced retention tactics, which means that employees would be sued if they tried to leave.[268] Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking employees, in many cases, leading to burnout within just a few years of joining the company. The company is often referred to as a \"Velvet Sweatshop,\" a term which originated in a 1989 *Seattle Times* article,[269] and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft's own employees.[270] This characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health.\n\n\nAs reported by several news outlets,[271][272] an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft based in the Republic of Ireland declared £220 bn in profits but paid no corporation tax for the year 2020. This is due to the company being tax resident in Bermuda as mentioned in the accounts for 'Microsoft Round Island One, a subsidiary that collects license fees from the use of Microsoft software worldwide. Dame Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP in the UK said, \"It is unsurprising – yet still shocking – that massively wealthy global corporations openly, unashamedly and blatantly refuse to pay tax on the profits they make in the countries where they undertake business\".[272]\n\n\nIn 2020, ProPublica reported that the company had diverted more than $39 billion in U.S. profits to Puerto Rico using a mechanism structured to make it seem as if the company was unprofitable on paper. As a result, the company paid a tax rate on those profits of \"nearly 0%.\" When the Internal Revenue Service audited these transactions, ProPublica reported that Microsoft aggressively fought back, including successfully lobbying Congress to change the law to make it harder for the agency to conduct audits of large corporations.[273][274]\n\n\n\"Embrace, extend, and extinguish\" (EEE),[275] also known as \"embrace, extend, and exterminate,\"[276] is a phrase that the U.S. Department of Justice found[277] that was used internally by Microsoft[278] to describe its strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those standards with proprietary capabilities, and then using those differences to strongly disadvantage competitors. Microsoft is frequently accused of using anticompetitive tactics and abusing its monopolistic power. People who use their products and services often end up becoming dependent on them, a process is known as vendor lock-in.\n\n\nMicrosoft was the first company to participate in the PRISM surveillance program, according to leaked NSA documents obtained by *The Guardian*[279] and *The Washington Post*[280] in June 2013, and acknowledged by government officials following the leak.[281] The program authorizes the government to secretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Microsoft has denied participation in such a program.[282]\n\n\nJesse Jackson believes Microsoft should hire more minorities and women. In 2015, he praised Microsoft for appointing two women to its board of directors.[283]\n\n\nIn 2020, Salesforce, the manufacturer of the Slack platform, complained to European regulators about Microsoft due to the integration of the Teams service into Office 365. Negotiations with the European Commission continued until the summer of 2023, but, as it became known to the media, they reached an impasse. Microsoft is now facing an antitrust investigation.[284]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Microsoft software\n* Microsoft hardware\n* List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft\n* Microsoft engineering groups\n* Microsoft Enterprise Agreement\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Microsoft Corporation Form 10-K\".

It has been referred to as \"one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world\",[1] and is one of the world's most valuable brands.[2]\n\n\nAmazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[3] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories: a strategy that has earned it the moniker The Everything Store.[4] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, MGM Holdings and Whole Foods Market.\n\n\n\n\n## Founding[edit]\n\n\nThe company was created as a result of what Jeff Bezos called his \"regret minimization framework\" – to avoid regretting, in his old age, not having tried to participate in the emerging internet with his own startup.[5] In 1994, Bezos left his job as a vice president at D. E. Shaw & Co., a Wall Street firm, and moved to Seattle, Washington, where he began to work on a business plan[6] for what would become Amazon.com.\n\n\nOn July 5, 1994, Bezos initially incorporated the company in Washington state with the name Cadabra, Inc.[7] After a few months, he changed the name to Amazon.com, Inc, because a lawyer misheard its original name as \"cadaver\".[8] Bezos selected this name by looking through a dictionary; he settled on \"Amazon\" because it was a place that was \"exotic and different\", just as he had envisioned for his Internet enterprise. The Amazon River, he noted, was the biggest river in the world, and he planned to make his store the biggest bookstore in the world.[9] Additionally, a name that began with \"A\" was preferred because it would probably be at the top of an alphabetized list.[9] Bezos placed a premium on his head start in building a brand and told a reporter, \"There's nothing about our model that can't be copied over time. But you know, McDonald's got copied. And it's still built a huge, multibillion-dollar company. A lot of it comes down to the brand name. Brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world.\"[10]\n\n\nIn its early days, the company was operated out of the garage of Bezos's house on Northeast 28th Street in Bellevue, Washington.[11]\n\n\n\n## Online bookstore and IPO[edit]\n\n\nAfter reading a report about the future of the Internet that projected annual web commerce growth at 2,300%, Bezos created a list of 20 products that could be marketed online. He narrowed the list to what he felt were the five most promising products, which included: compact discs, computer hardware, computer software, videos, and books. Bezos finally decided that his new business would sell books online, because of the large worldwide demand for literature, the low unit price for books, and the huge number of titles available in print.[12] Amazon was founded in the garage of Bezos' rented home in Bellevue, Washington.[9][13][14] Bezos' parents invested almost $250,000 in the start-up.[15]\n\n\nOn July 16, 1995, Amazon opened as an online bookseller, selling the world's largest collection of books to anyone with World Wide Web access.[16] The first book sold on Amazon.com was Douglas Hofstadter's *Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought*.[17] In the first two months of business, Amazon sold to all 50 states and over 45 countries. Within two months, Amazon's sales were up to $20,000 per week.[18] In October 1995, the company announced itself to the public.[19] In 1996, it was reincorporated in Delaware. Amazon issued its initial public offering of capital stock on May 15, 1997, at $18 per share, trading under the NASDAQ stock exchange symbol AMZN.[20]\n\n\nBarnes & Noble sued Amazon on May 12, 1997, alleging that Amazon's claim to be \"the world's largest bookstore\" was false because it \"...wasn't a bookstore at all. It's a book broker.\" The suit was later settled out of court and Amazon continued to make the same claim.[21] Walmart sued Amazon on October 16, 1998, alleging that Amazon had stolen Walmart's trade secrets by hiring former Walmart executives. Although this suit was also settled out of court, it caused Amazon to implement internal restrictions and the reassignment of the former Walmart executives.[21]\n\n\nIn 1999, Amazon first attempted to enter the publishing business by buying a defunct imprint, \"Weathervane\", and publishing some books \"selected with no apparent thought\", according to *The New Yorker*. The imprint quickly vanished again, and as of 2014[update] Amazon representatives said that they had never heard of it.[22] Also in 1999, *Time* magazine named Bezos the Person of the Year when it recognized the company's success in popularizing online shopping.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Amazon Toys Team employees circa 2000 during a summer Amazon party. Jeff Bezos is wearing the black shirt.\n## 2000s[edit]\n\n\nSince June 19, 2000, Amazon's logotype has featured a curved arrow leading from A to Z, representing that the company carries every product from A to Z, with the arrow shaped like a smile.[24]\n\n\nAccording to sources, Amazon did not expect to make a profit for four to five years. This comparatively slow growth caused stockholders to complain that the company was not reaching profitability fast enough to justify their investment or even survive in the long term. In 2001, the dot-com bubble burst destroyed many e-companies in the process, but Amazon survived and moved forward beyond the tech crash to become a huge player in online sales. The company finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001: $0.01 (i.e., 1¢ per share), on revenues of more than $1 billion. This profit margin, though extremely modest, proved to skeptics that Bezos' unconventional business model could succeed.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## 2010s to present[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Amazon had 30,000 full-time employees in the US, and by the end of 2016, it had 180,000 employees.[27]\n\n\nIn 2014, Amazon launched the Fire Phone. The Fire Phone was meant to deliver media streaming options but the venture failed, resulting in Amazon registering a $170 million loss. This would also lead to the Fire Phone production being stopped the following year. In August of the same year, Amazon would finalize the acquisition of Twitch, a social video gaming streaming site, for $970 million. This new acquisition would be integrated into the game production division of Amazon.\n\n\n\n![](image)Day 1 building in Seattle\nIn June 2017, Amazon announced that it would acquire Whole Foods, a high-end supermarket chain with over 400 stores, for $13.4 billion.[28][29] The acquisition was seen by media experts as a move to strengthen its physical holdings and challenge Walmart's supremacy as a brick and mortar retailer. This sentiment was heightened by the fact that the announcement coincided with Walmart's purchase of men's apparel company Bonobos.[30] On August 23, 2017, Whole Foods shareholders, as well as the Federal Trade Commission, approved the deal.[31][32]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Amazon announced plans to locate a second headquarters in a metropolitan area with at least a million people.[33] Cities needed to submit their presentations by October 19, 2017, for the project called HQ2.[34] The $5 billion second headquarters, starting with 500,000 square feet and eventually expanding to as much as 8 million square feet, may have as many as 50,000 employees.[35] In 2017, Amazon announced it would build a new downtown Seattle building with space for Mary's Place, a local charity in 2020.[36]\n\n\nAs 2017 came to a close, Amazon had over 566,000 employees worldwide.[37][38]\n\n\nAccording to an August 8, 2018, story in Bloomberg Businessweek, Amazon has about a 5 percent share of US retail spending (excluding cars and car parts and visits to restaurants and bars), and a 43.5 percent share of American online spending in 2018. The forecast is for Amazon to own 49 percent of the total American online spending in 2018, with two-thirds of Amazon's revenue coming from the US.[39]\n\n\nAmazon launched the last-mile delivery program and ordered 20,000 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Vans for the service in September 2018.[40][41]\n\n\nAmazon generated $386 billion in US retail e-commerce sales in 2020, up 38% over 2019. Amazon's Marketplace sales represent an increasingly dominant portion of its e-commerce business.\n\n\nOn November 14, 2022, it was announced that Amazon had plans to lay off 10,000 employees among its corporate and technology staff.[42] The number increased to 18,000 in a January 2023 announcement.[43] In March, Amazon announced it would eliminate an additional 9,000 jobs.[44]\n\n\nOn September 25, 2023, Amazon and artificial intelligence startup Anthropic announced a strategic partnership in which Amazon would become a minority stakeholder by investing up to US$4 billion, including an immediate investment of $1.25bn. As part of the deal, Anthropic would use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its primary cloud provider and will make its AI models available to AWS customers.[45][46]\n\n\nWith more than one million workers employed in warehouses around the world, Amazon in 2023 started testing humanoid robots that provide partial automation of its work tasks.[47] The robots are able to position empty boxes and indicate where new ones are stored. [48]\n\n\n\n### HQ2[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Amazon [49] announced it would open its highly sought-after new headquarters, known as (HQ2) in Long Island City, Queens, New York City,[50][51] and in the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia.[52] On February 14, 2019, Amazon announced it was not moving forward with plans to build HQ2 in Queens[53] but would instead focus solely on the Arlington location. The company plans to locate at least 25,000 employees at HQ2 by 2030 and will invest more than US$2.5 billion[54] to establish its new headquarters in Crystal City as well as neighboring Pentagon City and Potomac Yard, an area jointly marketed as \"National Landing.\" The announcement also created a new partnership with Virginia Tech University to develop an Innovation Campus to fill the demand for high-tech talent in National Landing and beyond.\n\n\n\n### COVID-19[edit]\n\n\nAt the end of March 2020, some workers of the Staten Island warehouse staged a walkout in protest of the poor health situation at their workplace amidst the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. One of the organizers, Chris Smalls, was first put on quarantine without anyone else being quarantined, and soon afterwards fired from the company.[55][56][57][58][59]\n\n\nThe pandemic caused a surge in online shopping and resulted in shortages of household staples both online and in some brick-and-mortar stores. From March 17[60] to April 10, 2020,[61] Amazon warehouses stopped accepting non-essential items from third-party sellers. The company hired approximately 175,000 additional warehouse workers and delivery contractors to deal with the surge, and temporarily raised wages by $2/hour.[61]\n\n\n\n### Acquisition of MGM[edit]\n\n\nAfter months of speculation due to MGM's poor financial performance from the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the movie industry, Amazon entered negotiations to acquire MGM at an estimated $9 billion on May 17, 2021.[62] The companies agreed to the merger deal on May 26, 2021, for a total value of $8.45 billion, subject to regulatory approval. The deal would allow Amazon to add the MGM library to the Amazon Prime Video catalog, with the studio continuing to operate as a label under the new parent company.[63] The merger was finalized on March 17, 2022, following the expiration of the FTC's review deadline[64] and having cleared the European Commission two days earlier on March 15.[65][66][67][68][69][70][71] Later that day, Amazon Studios and Prime Video SVP Mike Hopkins revealed that Amazon will continue to partner with United Artists Releasing (MGM and Annapurna Pictures' joint distribution venture), which will remain in operation to release all future MGM titles theatrically on a \"case-by-case basis,\" while \"all MGM employees will join my organization.\" It was also revealed that Amazon had no plans to make changes to the studio's production slate and release schedules nor make all MGM content exclusive to Prime Video, providing some hope that the studio would operate autonomously from Amazon Studios. These plans are expected to not impact the future of the James Bond franchise and its creative team. Two town halls further detailing MGM's future post-merger took place on March 18, 2022, which included one for MGM employees and one for Amazon Studios/Prime Video employees.[72] Both revealed the new interim reporting structure as part of Amazon's \"phased integration plan,\" which would involve De Luca, Mark Burnett (Chairman of MGM Worldwide Television) and COO Chris Brearton reporting to Hopkins on behalf of the studio.[73] On April 27, 2022, it was announced that De Luca and Abdy would leave the studio.[74]\n\n\n\n## Amazon Go[edit]\n\n\nOn January 22, 2018, Amazon Go, a store that uses cameras and sensors to detect items that a shopper grabs off shelves and automatically charges a shopper's Amazon account, was opened to the general public in Seattle.[75][76] Customers scan their Amazon Go app as they enter, and are required to have an Amazon Go app installed on their smartphone and a linked Amazon account to be able to enter.[75] The technology is meant to eliminate the need for checkout lines.[77][78][79] Amazon Go was initially opened for Amazon employees in December 2016.[80][81][82] By the end of 2018, there will be 8 total Amazon Go stores located in Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco and New York.[83]\n\n\n\n## Amazon 4-Star[edit]\n\n\nAmazon announced to debut the Amazon 4-star in New York, Soho neighborhood Spring Street between Crosby and Lafayette on 27 September 2018. The store carries 4-star and above-rated products from around New York.[84] The Amazon website searches for the most rated, highly demanded, frequently bought, and most wished for products which are then sold in the new Amazon store under separate categories. Along with the paper price tags, the online review cards will also be available for the customers to read before buying the product.[85][86] In late 2021, Amazon opened two 4-star stores in the United Kingdom. Its store at the Bluewater Shopping Centre in Kent opened in October, and its store at Westfield London opened in November.[87]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Amazon announced that they would be closing all 4-star stores, along with their Books and Pop Up stores, across the US and the UK, stating that they were refocusing on their grocery and fashion stores.[88]\n\n\n\n## Mergers and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nAmazon has grown through several mergers and acquisitions. The company has also invested in a number of growing firms, both in the United States and internationally.[89][90] In 2014, Amazon purchased top level domain .buy in auction for over $4 million.[91][92] The company has invested in brands that offer a wide range of services and products, including Engine Yard, a Ruby-on-Rails platform as a service company,[93] and Living Social, a local deal site.[94]\n\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Time period | Key developments at Amazon\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1994–1998 | Amazon started off as an online bookstore selling books, primarily competing with local booksellers and Barnes & Noble.

It has been referred to as \"one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world\",[1] and is one of the world's most valuable brands.[2]\n\n\nAmazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[3] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories: a strategy that has earned it the moniker The Everything Store.[4] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, MGM Holdings and Whole Foods Market.\n\n\n\n\n## Founding[edit]\n\n\nThe company was created as a result of what Jeff Bezos called his \"regret minimization framework\" – to avoid regretting, in his old age, not having tried to participate in the emerging internet with his own startup.[5] In 1994, Bezos left his job as a vice president at D. E. Shaw & Co., a Wall Street firm, and moved to Seattle, Washington, where he began to work on a business plan[6] for what would become Amazon.com.\n\n\nOn July 5, 1994, Bezos initially incorporated the company in Washington state with the name Cadabra, Inc.[7] After a few months, he changed the name to Amazon.com, Inc, because a lawyer misheard its original name as \"cadaver\".[8] Bezos selected this name by looking through a dictionary; he settled on \"Amazon\" because it was a place that was \"exotic and different\", just as he had envisioned for his Internet enterprise. The Amazon River, he noted, was the biggest river in the world, and he planned to make his store the biggest bookstore in the world.[9] Additionally, a name that began with \"A\" was preferred because it would probably be at the top of an alphabetized list.[9] Bezos placed a premium on his head start in building a brand and told a reporter, \"There's nothing about our model that can't be copied over time. But you know, McDonald's got copied. And it's still built a huge, multibillion-dollar company. A lot of it comes down to the brand name. Brand names are more important online than they are in the physical world.\"[10]\n\n\nIn its early days, the company was operated out of the garage of Bezos's house on Northeast 28th Street in Bellevue, Washington.[11]\n\n\n\n## Online bookstore and IPO[edit]\n\n\nAfter reading a report about the future of the Internet that projected annual web commerce growth at 2,300%, Bezos created a list of 20 products that could be marketed online. He narrowed the list to what he felt were the five most promising products, which included: compact discs, computer hardware, computer software, videos, and books. Bezos finally decided that his new business would sell books online, because of the large worldwide demand for literature, the low unit price for books, and the huge number of titles available in print.[12] Amazon was founded in the garage of Bezos' rented home in Bellevue, Washington.[9][13][14] Bezos' parents invested almost $250,000 in the start-up.[15]\n\n\nOn July 16, 1995, Amazon opened as an online bookseller, selling the world's largest collection of books to anyone with World Wide Web access.[16] The first book sold on Amazon.com was Douglas Hofstadter's *Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought*.[17] In the first two months of business, Amazon sold to all 50 states and over 45 countries. Within two months, Amazon's sales were up to $20,000 per week.[18] In October 1995, the company announced itself to the public.[19] In 1996, it was reincorporated in Delaware. Amazon issued its initial public offering of capital stock on May 15, 1997, at $18 per share, trading under the NASDAQ stock exchange symbol AMZN.[20]\n\n\nBarnes & Noble sued Amazon on May 12, 1997, alleging that Amazon's claim to be \"the world's largest bookstore\" was false because it \"...wasn't a bookstore at all. It's a book broker.\" The suit was later settled out of court and Amazon continued to make the same claim.[21] Walmart sued Amazon on October 16, 1998, alleging that Amazon had stolen Walmart's trade secrets by hiring former Walmart executives. Although this suit was also settled out of court, it caused Amazon to implement internal restrictions and the reassignment of the former Walmart executives.[21]\n\n\nIn 1999, Amazon first attempted to enter the publishing business by buying a defunct imprint, \"Weathervane\", and publishing some books \"selected with no apparent thought\", according to *The New Yorker*. The imprint quickly vanished again, and as of 2014[update] Amazon representatives said that they had never heard of it.[22] Also in 1999, *Time* magazine named Bezos the Person of the Year when it recognized the company's success in popularizing online shopping.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Amazon Toys Team employees circa 2000 during a summer Amazon party. Jeff Bezos is wearing the black shirt.\n## 2000s[edit]\n\n\nSince June 19, 2000, Amazon's logotype has featured a curved arrow leading from A to Z, representing that the company carries every product from A to Z, with the arrow shaped like a smile.[24]\n\n\nAccording to sources, Amazon did not expect to make a profit for four to five years. This comparatively slow growth caused stockholders to complain that the company was not reaching profitability fast enough to justify their investment or even survive in the long term. In 2001, the dot-com bubble burst destroyed many e-companies in the process, but Amazon survived and moved forward beyond the tech crash to become a huge player in online sales. The company finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001: $0.01 (i.e., 1¢ per share), on revenues of more than $1 billion. This profit margin, though extremely modest, proved to skeptics that Bezos' unconventional business model could succeed.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## 2010s to present[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Amazon had 30,000 full-time employees in the US, and by the end of 2016, it had 180,000 employees.[27]\n\n\nIn 2014, Amazon launched the Fire Phone. The Fire Phone was meant to deliver media streaming options but the venture failed, resulting in Amazon registering a $170 million loss. This would also lead to the Fire Phone production being stopped the following year. In August of the same year, Amazon would finalize the acquisition of Twitch, a social video gaming streaming site, for $970 million. This new acquisition would be integrated into the game production division of Amazon.\n\n\n\n![](image)Day 1 building in Seattle\nIn June 2017, Amazon announced that it would acquire Whole Foods, a high-end supermarket chain with over 400 stores, for $13.4 billion.[28][29] The acquisition was seen by media experts as a move to strengthen its physical holdings and challenge Walmart's supremacy as a brick and mortar retailer. This sentiment was heightened by the fact that the announcement coincided with Walmart's purchase of men's apparel company Bonobos.[30] On August 23, 2017, Whole Foods shareholders, as well as the Federal Trade Commission, approved the deal.[31][32]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Amazon announced plans to locate a second headquarters in a metropolitan area with at least a million people.[33] Cities needed to submit their presentations by October 19, 2017, for the project called HQ2.[34] The $5 billion second headquarters, starting with 500,000 square feet and eventually expanding to as much as 8 million square feet, may have as many as 50,000 employees.[35] In 2017, Amazon announced it would build a new downtown Seattle building with space for Mary's Place, a local charity in 2020.[36]\n\n\nAs 2017 came to a close, Amazon had over 566,000 employees worldwide.[37][38]\n\n\nAccording to an August 8, 2018, story in Bloomberg Businessweek, Amazon has about a 5 percent share of US retail spending (excluding cars and car parts and visits to restaurants and bars), and a 43.5 percent share of American online spending in 2018. The forecast is for Amazon to own 49 percent of the total American online spending in 2018, with two-thirds of Amazon's revenue coming from the US.[39]\n\n\nAmazon launched the last-mile delivery program and ordered 20,000 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Vans for the service in September 2018.[40][41]\n\n\nAmazon generated $386 billion in US retail e-commerce sales in 2020, up 38% over 2019. Amazon's Marketplace sales represent an increasingly dominant portion of its e-commerce business.\n\n\nOn November 14, 2022, it was announced that Amazon had plans to lay off 10,000 employees among its corporate and technology staff.[42] The number increased to 18,000 in a January 2023 announcement.[43] In March, Amazon announced it would eliminate an additional 9,000 jobs.[44]\n\n\nOn September 25, 2023, Amazon and artificial intelligence startup Anthropic announced a strategic partnership in which Amazon would become a minority stakeholder by investing up to US$4 billion, including an immediate investment of $1.25bn. As part of the deal, Anthropic would use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its primary cloud provider and will make its AI models available to AWS customers.[45][46]\n\n\nWith more than one million workers employed in warehouses around the world, Amazon in 2023 started testing humanoid robots that provide partial automation of its work tasks.[47] The robots are able to position empty boxes and indicate where new ones are stored. [48]\n\n\n\n### HQ2[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Amazon [49] announced it would open its highly sought-after new headquarters, known as (HQ2) in Long Island City, Queens, New York City,[50][51] and in the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia.[52] On February 14, 2019, Amazon announced it was not moving forward with plans to build HQ2 in Queens[53] but would instead focus solely on the Arlington location. The company plans to locate at least 25,000 employees at HQ2 by 2030 and will invest more than US$2.5 billion[54] to establish its new headquarters in Crystal City as well as neighboring Pentagon City and Potomac Yard, an area jointly marketed as \"National Landing.\" The announcement also created a new partnership with Virginia Tech University to develop an Innovation Campus to fill the demand for high-tech talent in National Landing and beyond.\n\n\n\n### COVID-19[edit]\n\n\nAt the end of March 2020, some workers of the Staten Island warehouse staged a walkout in protest of the poor health situation at their workplace amidst the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. One of the organizers, Chris Smalls, was first put on quarantine without anyone else being quarantined, and soon afterwards fired from the company.[55][56][57][58][59]\n\n\nThe pandemic caused a surge in online shopping and resulted in shortages of household staples both online and in some brick-and-mortar stores. From March 17[60] to April 10, 2020,[61] Amazon warehouses stopped accepting non-essential items from third-party sellers. The company hired approximately 175,000 additional warehouse workers and delivery contractors to deal with the surge, and temporarily raised wages by $2/hour.[61]\n\n\n\n### Acquisition of MGM[edit]\n\n\nAfter months of speculation due to MGM's poor financial performance from the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the movie industry, Amazon entered negotiations to acquire MGM at an estimated $9 billion on May 17, 2021.[62] The companies agreed to the merger deal on May 26, 2021, for a total value of $8.45 billion, subject to regulatory approval. The deal would allow Amazon to add the MGM library to the Amazon Prime Video catalog, with the studio continuing to operate as a label under the new parent company.[63] The merger was finalized on March 17, 2022, following the expiration of the FTC's review deadline[64] and having cleared the European Commission two days earlier on March 15.[65][66][67][68][69][70][71] Later that day, Amazon Studios and Prime Video SVP Mike Hopkins revealed that Amazon will continue to partner with United Artists Releasing (MGM and Annapurna Pictures' joint distribution venture), which will remain in operation to release all future MGM titles theatrically on a \"case-by-case basis,\" while \"all MGM employees will join my organization.\" It was also revealed that Amazon had no plans to make changes to the studio's production slate and release schedules nor make all MGM content exclusive to Prime Video, providing some hope that the studio would operate autonomously from Amazon Studios. These plans are expected to not impact the future of the James Bond franchise and its creative team. Two town halls further detailing MGM's future post-merger took place on March 18, 2022, which included one for MGM employees and one for Amazon Studios/Prime Video employees.[72] Both revealed the new interim reporting structure as part of Amazon's \"phased integration plan,\" which would involve De Luca, Mark Burnett (Chairman of MGM Worldwide Television) and COO Chris Brearton reporting to Hopkins on behalf of the studio.[73] On April 27, 2022, it was announced that De Luca and Abdy would leave the studio.[74]\n\n\n\n## Amazon Go[edit]\n\n\nOn January 22, 2018, Amazon Go, a store that uses cameras and sensors to detect items that a shopper grabs off shelves and automatically charges a shopper's Amazon account, was opened to the general public in Seattle.[75][76] Customers scan their Amazon Go app as they enter, and are required to have an Amazon Go app installed on their smartphone and a linked Amazon account to be able to enter.[75] The technology is meant to eliminate the need for checkout lines.[77][78][79] Amazon Go was initially opened for Amazon employees in December 2016.[80][81][82] By the end of 2018, there will be 8 total Amazon Go stores located in Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco and New York.[83]\n\n\n\n## Amazon 4-Star[edit]\n\n\nAmazon announced to debut the Amazon 4-star in New York, Soho neighborhood Spring Street between Crosby and Lafayette on 27 September 2018. The store carries 4-star and above-rated products from around New York.[84] The Amazon website searches for the most rated, highly demanded, frequently bought, and most wished for products which are then sold in the new Amazon store under separate categories. Along with the paper price tags, the online review cards will also be available for the customers to read before buying the product.[85][86] In late 2021, Amazon opened two 4-star stores in the United Kingdom. Its store at the Bluewater Shopping Centre in Kent opened in October, and its store at Westfield London opened in November.[87]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Amazon announced that they would be closing all 4-star stores, along with their Books and Pop Up stores, across the US and the UK, stating that they were refocusing on their grocery and fashion stores.[88]\n\n\n\n## Mergers and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nAmazon has grown through several mergers and acquisitions. The company has also invested in a number of growing firms, both in the United States and internationally.[89][90] In 2014, Amazon purchased top level domain .buy in auction for over $4 million.[91][92] The company has invested in brands that offer a wide range of services and products, including Engine Yard, a Ruby-on-Rails platform as a service company,[93] and Living Social, a local deal site.[94]\n\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Time period | Key developments at Amazon\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1994–1998 | Amazon started off as an online bookstore selling books, primarily competing with local booksellers and Barnes & Noble.

After hiring Ray Kroc as their franchise agent in 1954, they continued to run the company until they were bought out by Kroc in 1961.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nThe McDonald brothers were born in Manchester, New Hampshire, to Irish immigrants Patrick James and Margarete Anna Curran McDonald, who came to the United States as children.[3] Maurice was born in 1902, and Richard was born in 1909.[2] In the 1920s, the family moved to California, where Patrick opened a food stand in Monrovia in 1937.[4]\n\n\n\n## Careers[edit]\n\n\nIn 1948, the brothers fully redesigned and rebuilt their restaurant in San Bernardino to focus on a reduced menu consisting of nine items: In addition to their 15 cent hamburger, the menu would include a cheeseburger, soft drinks, milk, coffee, potato chips, and a slice of pie.[5] Their restaurant was about a mile from route 66 at 1398 North E Street at West 14th Street in San Bernardino. The site is now a museum.[6]\n\n\nThe McDonald brothers' restaurant was a success, and with the goal of making $1 million before they turned 50,[7] the McDonald brothers began franchising their system in 1953, beginning with a restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona, operated by Neil Fox.[5]\n\n\nThe brothers drew the attention of Ray Kroc, a milkshake mixer salesman for Prince Castle.[8] After they purchased eight of his Multi-Mixers for their San Bernardino, California restaurant, Kroc visited that restaurant in 1954.[9] That year the McDonald brothers hired Kroc as their franchise agent. Kroc took 1.9 percent of the gross sales, of which the McDonald brothers got 0.5 percent.[10][11]\n\n\nKroc became frustrated with the McDonald brothers' desire to maintain a small number of restaurants. The brothers also consistently told Kroc he could not make changes to things such as the original blueprint. Kroc became increasingly frustrated, and deciding he wanted control of the company entirely, Kroc bought the company in 1961 for $2.7 million, calculated so as to ensure each brother received $1 million after taxes.[12]\n\n\nAt the closing, Kroc became annoyed that the brothers would not transfer to him the real estate and rights to the original San Bernardino location. The brothers had told Kroc they were giving the operation, property and all, to the founding employees. In his anger, Kroc later opened a new McDonald's restaurant near the original McDonald's, which had been renamed \"The Big M\" because the brothers had neglected to retain rights to the name. \"The Big M\" closed six years later.[13] Speaking to someone about the buyout, Richard McDonald reportedly said that he had no regrets.[14]\n\n\nOn November 30, 1984, Richard McDonald, the first cook behind the grill of a McDonald's, was served the ceremonial 50 billionth McDonald's hamburger by Ed Rensi, then-president of McDonald's USA, at the Grand Hyatt hotel in New York City.[15][16][17]\n\n\n\n## Death and legacy[edit]\n\n\nMaurice McDonald died from heart failure[18] at his home in Palm Springs, California, on December 11, 1971, at the age of 69.[19]\n\n\nRichard McDonald also died from heart failure in a nursing home in Manchester, New Hampshire, on July 14, 1998, at the age of 89.[20] He was buried at the Mount Calvary Cemetery in Manchester.[7][16][21]\n\n\nIn the 2016 film *The Founder*, a biopic about Ray Kroc and his business relationship with the McDonald brothers, Richard (Dick) McDonald is played by Nick Offerman,[22][23] and John Carroll Lynch portrays Maurice (Mac) McDonald.[23]\n\n\nThe first McDonald's, according to the California Route 66 Association, is owned by Albert Okura and is a museum.[6][24]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  legacy.com\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Chatelain, Marcia (2020). \"Chapter One: Fast Food Civil Rights\". *Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America*.
