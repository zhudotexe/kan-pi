It includes river systems over 1,000 kilometres (620\u00a0mi) in length.\n\n\n\n\n## Definition of length[edit]\n\n\nThere are many factors, such as the identification of the source,[1] the identification or the definition of the mouth, and the scale of measurement[2] of the river length between source and mouth, that determine the precise meaning of \"river length\". As a result, the length measurements of many rivers are only approximations (see also coastline paradox). In particular, there seems to exist disagreement as to whether the Nile[3] or the Amazon[4] is the world's longest river. The Nile has traditionally been considered longer, but in 2007 and 2008 some scientists claimed that the Amazon is longer[5][6][7] by measuring the river plus the adjacent Par\u00e1 estuary and the longest connecting tidal canal.[8] A peer-reviewed article published 2009 in the *International Journal of Digital Earth* concludes that the Nile is longer.[9]\n\n\nEven when detailed maps are available, the length measurement is not always clear. A river may have multiple channels, or anabranches. The length may depend on whether the center or the edge of the river is measured. It may not be clear how to measure the length through a lake or reservoir. Seasonal and annual changes may alter both rivers and lakes. Other factors that can change the length of a river include cycles of erosion and flooding, dams, levees, and channelization. In addition, the length of meanders can change significantly over time due to natural or artificial cutoffs, when a new channel cuts across a narrow strip of land, bypassing a large river bend. For example, due to 18 cutoffs created between 1766 and 1885, the length of the Mississippi River from Cairo, Illinois, to New Orleans, Louisiana, was reduced by 351 kilometres (218 miles).[10]\n\n\nThese points make it difficult, if not impossible, to get an accurate measurement of the length of a river. The varying accuracy and precision also makes it difficult to make length comparisons between different rivers without a degree of uncertainty.\n\n\n\n## List of river systems longer than 1,000 km[edit]\n\n\nFor most rivers, different sources provide conflicting information on the length of a river system. The information in different sources is between parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(July 2011)*\n

Notes[edit]\n\n\n* When the length of a river is followed by an asterisk, it is an average of multiple information sources. If the difference in lengths between given information sources is significant, all lengths are listed. But if the lengths from secondary information sources are similar, they are averaged and that figure has an asterisk.\n* Scientists debate whether the Amazon or the Nile is the longest river in the world. Traditionally, the Nile is considered longer, but recent information suggests that the Amazon may be longer. Differences in the recorded length of the Amazon mainly depend on whether the course south of the Ilha de Maraj\u00f3 at the Amazon's mouth is to be treated as part of the Amazon, or as part of the separate Tocantins River. New evidence, (dated 16 June 2007) obtained from a high-altitude scientific venture in the Andes, claims that \"the Amazon is longer than the Nile by 100\u00a0km, with its longest headwater being the Carhuasanta stream originating in the south of Peru on the Nevado Mismi mountain's northern slopes and flowing into the R\u00edo Apur\u00edmac\".[29] However, the origin of the river at Nevado Mismi had already been known more than one decade earlier (see Jacek Palkiewicz), and satellite based measuring from this origin to the Amazon mouth has resulted in not more than 6,400\u00a0km.\n* Generally, the most commonly used/anglicised name of the river is used. The name in a native language or alternate spelling may be shown.\n\n\n![](image)The Mississippi River just north of St. Louis\n![](image)Saint Lawrence River along the New York-Quebec border\n## River systems that may have existed in the past[edit]\n\n\n### Amazon\u2013Congo[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon basin formerly drained westwards into the Pacific Ocean, until the Andes rose and reversed the drainage.[30]\n\n\nThe Congo basin is completely surrounded by high land, except for its long narrow exit valley past Kinshasa, including waterfalls around Manyanga. That gives the impression that most of the Congo basin was formerly on a much higher land level and that the Congo River was rejuvenated by much of its lower course being removed, likeliest when Africa split from South America when Gondwanaland broke up due to continental drift, and before that, the Congo would likely have flowed into the Amazon,[30] producing a river around 6000 miles or 10,000\u00a0km long.\n\n\n\n### West Siberian Glacial Lake drainage[edit]\n\n\nMain article: West Siberian Glacial Lake\n\nThis river would have been about 10,000\u00a0km (6,200\u00a0mi) long, in the last ice age. Its longest headwater was the Selenga river of Mongolia: it drained through ice-dammed lakes and the Aral Sea and the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea.\n\n\n\n### Lobourg[edit]\n\n\nDuring the last glacial maximum, much of what is now the southern part of the North Sea was land, known to archaeologists as Doggerland. At this time, the Thames, the Meuse, the Scheldt, and the Rhine probably joined before flowing into the sea, in a system known by palaeogeographers as the Loubourg or Lobourg River System.[31] There is some debate as to whether this river would have flowed southwest into what is now the English Channel, or flowed north, emerging into the North Sea close to modern Yorkshire. If the latter hypothesis is true, the Rhine would have attained a length of close to 1,650 kilometres (1,030\u00a0mi). The former hypothesis would have produced a shorter river, some 1,400 kilometres (870\u00a0mi) in length. Current scientific research favours the former opinion, with the Thames and Rhine meeting in a large lake, the outflow of which was close to the present-day Straits of Dover.[32]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lists of rivers\n* List of drainage basins by area\n* List of rivers by discharge\n* List of river films and television series\n\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\nNotes\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The Nile is usually said to be the longest river in the world, with a length of about 6,650\u00a0km,[3] and the Amazon the second longest, with a length of at least 6,400\u00a0km.[4] In 2007 and 2008, some scientists claimed that the Amazon has a length of 6,992\u00a0km and was longer than the Nile, whose length was calculated as 6,853\u00a0km.[6][11][7] They achieved this result by adding the waterway from the Amazon's southern outlet through tidal canals and the Par\u00e1 estuary of the Tocantins.[*citation needed*] The dispute is: \"Is the channel south of Isla de Maraj\u00f3 to be treated as part of the Amazon, or as part of the Rio Tocantins?\"[*citation needed*]\nA peer-reviewed article, published in 2009, states a length of 7,088\u00a0km for the Nile and 6,575\u00a0km for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[9]\nAccording to the *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*, as of 2020, the length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[4][8] \nNote that disputed values have been put in parentheses.\n\nReferences\n1. **^** \"Where Does the Amazon River Begin?\". *National Geographic News*. 2014-02-15.

Spanish: *R\u00edo Amazonas*, Portuguese: *Rio Amazonas*) in South America is the largest river by discharge volume of water in the world, and the disputed longest river system in the world in comparison to the Nile.[2][16][n 2]\n\n\nThe headwaters of the Apur\u00edmac River on Nevado Mismi had been considered for nearly a century the Amazon basin's most distant source until a 2014 study found it to be the headwaters of the Mantaro River on the Cordillera Rumi Cruz in Peru.[21] The Mantaro and Apur\u00edmac rivers join, and with other tributaries form the Ucayali River, which in turn meets the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River upstream of Iquitos, Peru, forming what countries other than Brazil consider to be the main stem of the Amazon. Brazilians call this section the Solim\u00f5es River above its confluence with the Rio Negro[22] forming what Brazilians call the Amazon at the Meeting of Waters (Portuguese: *Encontro das \u00c1guas*) at Manaus, the largest city on the river.\n\n\nThe Amazon River has an average discharge of about 215,000\u2013230,000\u00a0m3/s (7,600,000\u20138,100,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s)\u2014approximately 6,591\u20137,570\u00a0km3 (1,581\u20131,816\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) per year, greater than the next seven largest independent rivers combined. Two of the top ten rivers by discharge are tributaries of the Amazon river. The Amazon represents 20% of the global riverine discharge into oceans.[23] The Amazon basin is the largest drainage basin in the world, with an area of approximately 7,000,000\u00a0km2 (2,700,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[2] The portion of the river's drainage basin in Brazil alone is larger than any other river's basin. The Amazon enters Brazil with only one-fifth of the flow it finally discharges into the Atlantic Ocean, yet already has a greater flow at this point than the discharge of any other river.[24][25]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon was initially known by Europeans as the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, and the Peruvian part of the river is still known by that name today. It later became known as Rio Amazonas in Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n\nThe name Rio Amazonas was reportedly given after native warriors attacked a 16th-century expedition by Francisco de Orellana. The warriors were led by women, reminding de Orellana of the Amazon warriors, a tribe of women warriors related to Iranian Scythians and Sarmatians[26][27] mentioned in Greek mythology.\nThe word Amazon itself may be derived from the Iranian compound \\* ha-maz-an- \"(one) fighting together\"[28] or ethnonym *\\* ha-mazan-* \"warriors\", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in Hesychius of Alexandria's gloss \"\u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u00b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd. \u03a0\u03ad\u03c1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9\" (\"**hamazakaran**: 'to make war' in Persian\"), where it appears together with the Indo-Iranian root *\\* kar-* \"make\" (from which Sanskrit *karma* is also derived).[29]\n\n\nOther scholars[*who?*] claim that the name is derived from the Tupi word *amassona*, meaning \"boat destroyer\".[30]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Timeline of Amazon history\n\n### Geological history[edit]\n\n\nRecent geological studies suggest that for millions of years the Amazon River used to flow in the opposite direction - from east to west. Eventually the Andes Mountains formed, blocking its flow to the Pacific Ocean, and causing it to switch directions to its current mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.[31]\n\n\n\n### Pre-Columbian era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old drawing (from 1879) of Arapaima fishing at the Amazon river. The arapaima has been on Earth for at least 23 million years.[32]\nDuring what many archaeologists called the *formative stage*, Amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of South America's highland agrarian systems. The trade with Andean civilizations in the terrains of the headwaters in the Andes formed an essential contribution to the social and religious development of higher-altitude civilizations like the Muisca and Incas. Early human settlements were typically based on low-lying hills or mounds.\n\n\nShell mounds were the earliest evidence of habitation; they represent piles of human refuse (waste) and are mainly dated between 7500\u00a0BC and 4000\u00a0BC. They are associated with ceramic age cultures; no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists.[33] Artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds. They are best represented by the Marajoara culture. Figurative mounds are the most recent types of occupation.\n\n\nThere is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed towns and cities.[34] Archaeologists estimate that by the time the Spanish conquistador De Orellana traveled across the Amazon in 1541, more than 3 million indigenous people lived around the Amazon.[35] These pre-Columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations. For instance, pre-Columbian indigenous people on the island of Maraj\u00f3 may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people. To achieve this level of development, the indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest altered the forest's ecology by selective cultivation and the use of fire. Scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repeatedly, the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients. This created dark soil areas known as *terra preta de \u00edndio* (\"Indian dark earth\").[36] Because of the terra preta, indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures. Further research has hypothesized that this practice began around 11,000 years ago. Some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the Amazon basin.[36]\n\n\nMany indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. According to James S. Olson, \"The Munduruku expansion (in the 18th century) dislocated and displaced the Kawah\u00edb, breaking the tribe down into much smaller groups\u00a0... [Munduruku] first came to the attention of Europeans in 1770 when they began a series of widespread attacks on Brazilian settlements along the Amazon River.\"[37]\n\n\n\n### Arrival of Europeans[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon tributaries near Manaus\nIn March 1500, Spanish conquistador Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n was the first documented European to sail up the Amazon River.[38] Pinz\u00f3n called the stream *R\u00edo Santa Mar\u00eda del Mar Dulce*, later shortened to *Mar Dulce*, literally, *sweet sea*, because of its freshwater pushing out into the ocean. Another Spanish explorer, Francisco de Orellana, was the first European to travel from the origins of the upstream river basins, situated in the Andes, to the mouth of the river. In this journey, Orellana baptized some of the affluents of the Amazonas like Rio Negro, Napo and Jurua.\nThe name Amazonas is thought to be taken from the native warriors that attacked this expedition, mostly women, that reminded De Orellana of the mythical female Amazon warriors from the ancient Hellenic culture in Greece (see also Origin of the name).\n\n\n\n### Exploration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Fritz's 1707 map showing the Amazon and the Orinoco\nGonzalo Pizarro set off in 1541 to explore east of Quito into the South American interior in search of *El Dorado*, the \"city of gold\" and La Canela, the \"valley of cinnamon\".[39] He was accompanied by his second-in-command Francisco de Orellana. After 170\u00a0km (106\u00a0mi), the Coca River joined the Napo River (at a point now known as Puerto Francisco de Orellana); the party stopped for a few weeks to build a boat just upriver from this confluence. They continued downriver through an uninhabited area, where they could not find food. Orellana offered and was ordered to follow the Napo River, then known as *R\u00edo de la Canela* (\"Cinnamon River\"), and return with food for the party. Based on intelligence received from a captive native chief named Delicola, they expected to find food within a few days downriver by ascending another river to the north.\n\n\nDe Orellana took about 57 men, the boat, and some canoes and left Pizarro's troops on 26 December 1541. However, De Orellana missed the confluence (probably with the Aguarico) where he was searching supplies for his men. By the time he and his men reached another village, many of them were sick from hunger and eating \"noxious plants\", and near death. Seven men died in that village. His men threatened to mutiny if the expedition turned back to attempt to rejoin Pizarro, the party being over 100 leagues downstream at this point. He accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of Spain, and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream. After a journey of 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) down the Napo River, they reached a further major confluence, at a point near modern Iquitos, and then followed the upper Amazon, now known as the Solim\u00f5es, for a further 1,200\u00a0km (746\u00a0mi) to its confluence with the Rio Negro (near modern Manaus), which they reached on 3 June 1542.\n\n\nRegarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon, Pizarro reported to the king that they had found cinnamon trees, but that they could not be profitably harvested. True cinnamon (*Cinnamomum Verum*) is not native to South America. Other related cinnamon-containing plants (of the family *Lauraceae*) are fairly common in that part of the Amazon and Pizarro probably saw some of these. The expedition reached the mouth of the Amazon on 24 August 1542, demonstrating the practical navigability of the Great River.\n\n\n\n![](image)Masked-dance, and wedding-feast of Ticuna Indians, engravings for Bates's 1863 *The Naturalist on the River Amazons*\nIn 1560, another Spanish conquistador, Lope de Aguirre, may have made the second descent of the Amazon. Historians are uncertain whether the river he descended was the Amazon or the Orinoco River, which runs more or less parallel to the Amazon further north.\n\n\nPortuguese explorer Pedro Teixeira was the first European to travel up the entire river. He arrived in Quito in 1637, and returned via the same route.[40]\n\n\nFrom 1648 to 1652, Portuguese Brazilian *bandeirante* Ant\u00f3nio Raposo Tavares led an expedition from S\u00e3o Paulo overland to the mouth of the Amazon, investigating many of its tributaries, including the Rio Negro, and covering a distance of over 10,000\u00a0km (6,200\u00a0mi).\n\n\nIn what is currently in Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, several colonial and religious settlements were established along the banks of primary rivers and tributaries for trade, slaving, and evangelization among the indigenous peoples of the vast rainforest, such as the Urarina. In the late 1600s, Czech Jesuit Father Samuel Fritz, an apostle of the Omagus established some forty mission villages. Fritz proposed that the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River must be the source of the Amazon, noting on his 1707 map that the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n \"has its source on the southern shore of a lake that is called Lauricocha, near Hu\u00e1nuco.\" Fritz reasoned that the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n is the largest river branch one encounters when journeying upstream, and lies farther to the west than any other tributary of the Amazon. For most of the 18th\u201319th centuries and into the 20th century, the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n was generally considered the source of the Amazon.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Henry Walter Bates was most famous for his expedition to the Amazon (1848\u20131859).\n### Scientific exploration[edit]\n\n\nEarly scientific, zoological, and botanical exploration of the Amazon River and basin took place from the 18th century through the first half of the 19th century.\n\n\n\n* Charles Marie de La Condamine explored the river in 1743.[42]\n* Alexander von Humboldt, 1799\u20131804\n* Johann Baptist von Spix and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius, 1817\u20131820\n* Georg von Langsdorff, 1826\u20131828\n* Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace, 1848\u20131859\n* Richard Spruce, 1849\u20131864\n\n\n### Post-colonial exploitation and settlement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazonas state\n![Amazon Theatre opera house in Manaus built in 1896 during the rubber boom](image)\nAmazon Theatre opera house in Manaus built in 1896 during the rubber boom\n![Metropolitan Cathedral of Santar\u00e9m, in Santar\u00e9m, Brazil](image)\nMetropolitan Cathedral of Santar\u00e9m, in Santar\u00e9m, Brazil\n\n![](image)Iglesia Matriz in Iquitos, Peru\nThe Cabanagem revolt (1835\u20131840) was directed against the white ruling class. It is estimated that from 30% to 40% of the population of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1, estimated at 100,000 people, died.[43]\n\n\nThe population of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon basin in 1850 was perhaps 300,000, of whom about 175,000 were Europeans and 25,000 were slaves. The Brazilian Amazon's principal commercial city, Par\u00e1 (now Bel\u00e9m), had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, including slaves. The town of Man\u00e1os, now Manaus, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had a population between 1,000 and 1,500. All the remaining villages, as far up as Tabatinga, on the Brazilian frontier of Peru, were relatively small.[44]\n\n\nOn 6 September 1850, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the Amazon and gave the Viscount of Mau\u00e1 (Irineu Evangelista de Sousa) the task of putting it into effect. He organised the \"Companhia de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o e Com\u00e9rcio do Amazonas\" in Rio de Janeiro in 1852; in the following year it commenced operations with four small steamers, the *Monarca* ('Monarch'), the *Camet\u00e1*, the *Maraj\u00f3* and the *Rio Negro*.[44][45]\n\n\nAt first, navigation was principally confined to the main river; and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between Par\u00e1 and Manaus, with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity, a second line to make six round voyages a year between Manaus and Tabatinga, and a third, two trips a month between Par\u00e1 and Camet\u00e1.[44] This was the first step in opening up the vast interior.\n\n\nThe success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the Amazon, and a second company soon opened commerce on the Madeira, Pur\u00fas, and Negro; a third established a line between Par\u00e1 and Manaus, and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams. In that same period, the Amazonas Company was increasing its fleet. Meanwhile, private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries.[44]\n\n\nOn 31 July 1867, the government of Brazil, constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the upper Amazon basin, especially Peru, decreed the opening of the Amazon to all countries, but they limited this to certain defined points: Tabatinga \u2013 on the Amazon; Camet\u00e1 \u2013 on the Tocantins; Santar\u00e9m \u2013 on the Tapaj\u00f3s; Borba \u2013 on the Madeira, and Manaus \u2013 on the Rio Negro. The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867.[44]\n\n\nThanks in part to the mercantile development associated with steamboat navigation coupled with the internationally driven demand for natural rubber, the Peruvian city of Iquitos became a thriving, cosmopolitan center of commerce. Foreign companies settled in Iquitos, from where they controlled the extraction of rubber. In 1851 Iquitos had a population of 200, and by 1900 its population reached 20,000. In the 1860s, approximately 3,000 tons of rubber were being exported annually, and by 1911 annual exports had grown to 44,000 tons, representing 9.3% of Peru's exports.[46] During the rubber boom it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as typhus and malaria, killed 40,000 native Amazonians.[47]\n\n\nThe first direct foreign trade with Manaus commenced around 1874. Local trade along the river was carried on by the English successors to the Amazonas Company\u2014the Amazon Steam Navigation Company\u2014as well as numerous small steamboats, belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade, navigating the Negro, Madeira, Pur\u00fas, and many other tributaries,[44] such as the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, to ports as distant as Nauta, Peru.\n\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the exports of the Amazon basin were India-rubber, cacao beans, Brazil nuts and a few other products of minor importance, such as pelts and exotic forest produce (resins, barks, woven hammocks, prized bird feathers, live animals) and extracted goods, such as lumber and gold.\n\n\n\n### 20th-century development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Manaus, the largest city in Amazonas, as seen from a NASA satellite image, surrounded by the dark Rio Negro and the muddy Amazon River\n![](image)City of Manaus\n![](image)Floating houses in Leticia, Colombia\nSince colonial times, the Portuguese portion of the Amazon basin has remained a land largely undeveloped by agriculture and occupied by indigenous people who survived the arrival of European diseases.\n\n\nFour centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than 65\u00a0km2 (25\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters.[48] This situation changed dramatically during the 20th century.\n\n\nWary of foreign exploitation of the nation's resources, Brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior, away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land. The original architect of this expansion was president Get\u00falio Vargas, with the demand for rubber from the Allied forces in World War II providing funding for the drive.\n\n\nIn the 1960s, economic exploitation of the Amazon basin was seen as a way to fuel the \"economic miracle\" occurring at the time. This resulted in the development of \"Operation Amazon\", an economic development project that brought large-scale agriculture and ranching to Amazonia. This was done through a combination of credit and fiscal incentives.[49]\n\n\nHowever, in the 1970s the government took a new approach with the National Integration Program (PIN). A large-scale colonization program saw families from northeastern Brazil relocated to the \"land without people\" in the Amazon Basin. This was done in conjunction with infrastructure projects mainly the Trans-Amazonian Highway (*Transamaz\u00f4nica*).[49]\n\n\nThe Trans-Amazonian Highway's three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise. Large portions of the Trans-Amazonian and its accessory roads, such as BR-317 (Manaus-Porto Velho), are derelict and impassable in the rainy season. Small towns and villages are scattered across the forest, and because its vegetation is so dense, some remote areas are still unexplored.\n\n\nMany settlements grew along the road from Bras\u00edlia to Bel\u00e9m with the highway and National Integration Program, however, the program failed as the settlers were unequipped to live in the delicate rainforest ecosystem. This, although the government believed it could sustain millions, instead could sustain very few.[50]\n\n\nWith a population of 1.9 million people in 2014, Manaus is the largest city on the Amazon. Manaus alone makes up approximately 50% of the population of the largest Brazilian state of Amazonas. The racial makeup of the city is 64% pardo (mulatto and mestizo) and 32% white.[51]\n\n\nAlthough the Amazon river remains undammed, around 412 dams are in operation in the Amazon's tributary rivers. From these 412 dams, 151 are constructed over six of the main tributary rivers that drain into the Amazon.[52] Since only 4% of the Amazon's hydropower potential has been developed in countries like Brazil,[53] more damming projects are underway and hundreds more are planned.[54] After witnessing the negative effects of environmental degradation, sedimentation, navigation and flood control caused by the Three Gorges Dam in the Yangtze River,[55] scientists are worried that constructing more dams in the Amazon will harm its biodiversity in the same way by \"blocking fish-spawning runs, reducing the flows of vital oil nutrients and clearing forests\".[54] Damming the Amazon River could potentially bring about the \"end of free flowing rivers\" and contribute to an \"ecosystem collapse\" that will cause major social and environmental problems.[52]\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Source of the Amazon River\n\n![](image)The Amazon was thought to originate from the Apacheta cliff in Arequipa at the Nevado Mismi, marked only by a wooden cross.\n![](image)Nevado Mismi, formerly considered to be the source of the Amazon\n![](image)Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River in Peru\nThe most distant source of the Amazon was thought to be in the Apur\u00edmac river drainage for nearly a century. Such studies continued to be published even recently, such as in 1996,[56] 2001,[57] 2007,[18] and 2008,[58] where various authors identified the snowcapped 5,597\u00a0m (18,363\u00a0ft) Nevado Mismi peak, located roughly 160\u00a0km (99\u00a0mi) west of Lake Titicaca and 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi) southeast of Lima, as the most distant source of the river. From that point, Quebrada Carhuasanta emerges from Nevado Mismi, joins Quebrada Apacheta and soon forms R\u00edo Lloqueta which becomes R\u00edo Hornillos and eventually joins the R\u00edo Apur\u00edmac.\n\n\nA 2014 study by Americans James Contos and Nicolas Tripcevich in *Area*, a peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Geographical Society, however, identifies the most distant source of the Amazon as actually being in the R\u00edo Mantaro drainage.[21] A variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the Mantaro river vs. the Apur\u00edmac river from their most distant source points to their confluence, showing the longer length of the Mantaro. Then distances from Lago Jun\u00edn to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin). The most accurate measurement method was direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence (performed by Contos). Obtaining these measurements was difficult given the class IV\u2013V nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80\u00a0km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apur\u00edmac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80\u00a0km longer than previously thought. Contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the Amazon river from its newly identified source (finishing November 2012), a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.[59]\n\n\nAfter about 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi), the Apur\u00edmac then joins R\u00edo Mantaro to form the Ene, which joins the Perene to form the Tambo, which joins the Urubamba River to form the Ucayali. After the confluence of Apur\u00edmac and Ucayali, the river leaves Andean terrain and is surrounded by floodplain. From this point to the confluence of the Ucayali and the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, some 1,600\u00a0km (990\u00a0mi), the forested banks are just above the water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage.[44] The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills, and the river enters the enormous Amazon rainforest.\n\n\n\n### The Upper Amazon or Solim\u00f5es[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon River near Iquitos, Peru\nAlthough the Ucayali\u2013Mara\u00f1\u00f3n confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the Amazon River proper, in Brazil the river is known at this point as the *Solim\u00f5es das \u00c1guas*. The river systems and flood plains in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, whose waters drain into the *Solim\u00f5es* and its tributaries, are called the \"Upper Amazon\".\n\n\nThe Amazon proper runs mostly through Brazil and Peru, and is part of the border between Colombia and Per\u00fa. It has a series of major tributaries in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, some of which flow into the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n and Ucayali, and others directly into the Amazon proper. These include rivers Putumayo, Caquet\u00e1, Vaup\u00e9s, Guain\u00eda, Morona, Pastaza, Nucuray, Urituyacu, Chambira, Tigre, Nanay, Napo, and Huallaga.\n\n\nAt some points, the river divides into anabranches, or multiple channels, often very long, with inland and lateral channels, all connected by a complicated system of natural canals, cutting the low, flat *igap\u00f3* lands, which are never more than 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) above low river, into many islands.[60]\n\n\nFrom the town of Canaria at the great bend of the Amazon to the Negro, vast areas of land are submerged at high water, above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests appear. Near the mouth of the Rio Negro to Serpa, nearly opposite the river Madeira, the banks of the Amazon are low, until approaching Manaus, they rise to become rolling hills.[44]\n\n\n\n### The Lower Amazon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Meeting of Waters; the confluence of Rio Negro (blue) and Rio Solim\u00f5es (sandy) near Manaus, Brazil\n![](image)Water samples of the Solim\u00f5es (right) and Rio Negro (left)\nThe Lower Amazon begins where the darkly colored waters of the Rio Negro meets the sandy-colored Rio Solim\u00f5es (the upper Amazon), and for over 6\u00a0km (3.7\u00a0mi) these waters run side by side without mixing. At \u00d3bidos, a bluff 17\u00a0m (56\u00a0ft) above the river is backed by low hills. The lower Amazon seems to have once been a gulf of the Atlantic Ocean, the waters of which washed the cliffs near \u00d3bidos.\n\n\nOnly about 10% of the Amazon's water enters downstream of \u00d3bidos, very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley. The drainage area of the Amazon basin above \u00d3bidos city is about 5,000,000\u00a0km2 (1,900,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and, below, only about 1,000,000\u00a0km2 (390,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (around 20%), exclusive of the 1,400,000\u00a0km2 (540,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of the Tocantins basin.[44] The Tocantins River enters the southern portion of the Amazon delta.\n\n\nIn the lower reaches of the river, the north bank consists of a series of steep, table-topped hills extending for about 240\u00a0km (150\u00a0mi) from opposite the mouth of the Xingu as far as Monte Alegre. These hills are cut down to a kind of terrace which lies between them and the river.[60]\n\n\nOn the south bank, above the Xingu, a line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to Santar\u00e9m in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest, and, abutting upon the lower Tapaj\u00f3s, merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the Tapaj\u00f3s river valley.[61]\n\n\n\n### Mouth[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of the mouth of the Amazon River, from the north looking south\nBel\u00e9m is the major city and port at the mouth of the river at the Atlantic Ocean. The definition of where exactly the mouth of the Amazon is located, and how wide it is, is a matter of dispute, because of the area's peculiar geography. The Par\u00e1 and the Amazon are connected by a series of river channels called *furos* near the town of Breves; between them lies Maraj\u00f3, the world's largest combined river/sea island.\n\n\nIf the Par\u00e1 river and the Maraj\u00f3 island ocean frontage are included, the Amazon estuary is some 325\u00a0km (202\u00a0mi) wide.[62] In this case, the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo Norte, the cape located straight east of Pracu\u00faba in the Brazilian state of Amap\u00e1, to Ponta da Tijoca near the town of Curu\u00e7\u00e1, in the state of Par\u00e1.\n\n\nA more conservative measurement excluding the Par\u00e1 river estuary, from the mouth of the Araguari River to Ponta do Navio on the northern coast of Maraj\u00f3, would still give the mouth of the Amazon a width of over 180\u00a0km (112\u00a0mi). If only the river's main channel is considered, between the islands of Curu\u00e1 (state of Amap\u00e1) and Jurupari (state of Par\u00e1), the width falls to about 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi).\n\n\nThe plume generated by the river's discharge covers up to 1.3 million km2 and is responsible for muddy bottoms influencing a wide area of the tropical north Atlantic in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation.[23]\n\n\n\n### Lack of bridges[edit]\n\n\nThere are no bridges across the entire width of the river.[63] This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry. The Manaus Iranduba Bridge linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the Rio Negro, the second-largest tributary of the Amazon, just before their confluence.\n\n\n\n### Dispute regarding length[edit]\n\n\n![](image)River taxi in Peru\nSee also: Coastline paradox\n\nWhile debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest. However, the Amazon has been reported as being anywhere between 6,275\u00a0km (3,899\u00a0mi) and 6,992\u00a0km (4,345\u00a0mi) long.[3] It is often said to be \"at least\" 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi) long.[2] The Nile is reported to be anywhere from 5,499 to 7,088\u00a0km (3,417 to 4,404\u00a0mi).[3] Often it is said to be \"about\" 6,650\u00a0km (4,130\u00a0mi) long.[17] There are several factors that can affect these measurements, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n\n\nIn July 2008, the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE) published a news article on their webpage, claiming that the Amazon River was 140\u00a0km (87\u00a0mi) longer than the Nile. The Amazon's length was calculated as 6,992\u00a0km (4,345\u00a0mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853\u00a0km (4,258\u00a0mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of *Canal do Sul* and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Maraj\u00f3 and finally including the marine waters of the *R\u00edo Par\u00e1* bay in its entire length.[58][20] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800\u00a0km (4,200\u00a0mi) by a Brazilian scientist. In June 2007, Guido Gelli, director of science at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), told London's Telegraph Newspaper that it could be considered that the Amazon was the longest river in the world.[64] However, according to the above sources, none of the two results was published, and questions were raised about the researchers' methodology. In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of 7,088\u00a0km (4,404\u00a0mi) for the Nile and 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi) for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon basin\n\nThe Amazon basin, the largest in the world, covers about 40% of South America, an area of approximately 7,050,000\u00a0km2 (2,720,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It drains from west to east, from Iquitos in Peru, across Brazil to the Atlantic. It gathers its waters from 5 degrees north latitude to 20 degrees south latitude. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-Andean plateau, just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean.[65]\n\n\nThe Amazon River and its tributaries are characterised by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season. Every year, the river rises more than 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft), flooding the surrounding forests, known as *v\u00e1rzea* (\"flooded forests\"). The Amazon's flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world.[66] In an average dry season, 110,000\u00a0km2 (42,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land are water-covered, while in the wet season, the flooded area of the Amazon basin rises to 350,000\u00a0km2 (140,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[62]\n\n\nThe quantity of water released by the Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean is enormous: up to 300,000\u00a0m3/s (11,000,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) in the rainy season, with an average of 209,000\u00a0m3/s (7,400,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) from 1973 to 1990.[67] The Amazon is responsible for about 20% of the Earth's fresh water entering the ocean.[66] The river pushes a vast plume of fresh water into the ocean. The plume is about 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) long and between 100 and 200\u00a0km (62 and 124\u00a0mi) wide. The fresh water, being lighter, flows on top of the seawater, diluting the salinity and altering the colour of the ocean surface over an area up to 2,500,000\u00a0km2 (970,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in extent. For centuries ships have reported fresh water near the Amazon's mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean.[25]\n\n\nThe Atlantic has sufficient wave and tidal energy to carry most of the Amazon's sediments out to sea, thus the Amazon does not form a true delta. The great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water, while the Amazon empties directly into the turbulent Atlantic.[22]\n\n\nThere is a natural water union between the Amazon and the Orinoco basins, the so-called Casiquiare canal. The Casiquiare is a river distributary of the upper Orinoco, which flows southward into the Rio Negro, which in turn flows into the Amazon. The Casiquiare is the largest river on earth that links two major river systems, a so-called bifurcation.\n\n\n\n## Discharge[edit]\n\n\nAverage discharge at the estuary; Period from 2003 to 2015: 7,200\u00a0km3/a (230,000\u00a0m3/s)[68][69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n | Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2003\n | 6,470\n | 205,000\n | 2010\n | 6,464\n | 205,000\n |\n| 2004\n | 6,747\n | 214,000\n | 2011\n | 7,378\n | 234,000\n |\n| 2005\n | 6,522\n | 207,000\n | 2012\n | 7,513\n | 238,000\n |\n| 2006\n | 7,829\n | 248,000\n | 2013\n | 7,288\n | 231,000\n |\n| 2007\n | 7,133\n | 226,000\n | 2014\n | 7,674\n | 243,000\n |\n| 2008\n | 7,725\n | 245,000\n | 2015\n | 6,657\n | 211,000\n |\n| 2009\n | 8,200\n | 260,000\n |  |\n\n\nAverage discharge at \u00d3bidos gauge station; Period from 1969 to 2018: 5,520\u00a0km3/a (175,000\u00a0m3/s)[68][69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n | Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1969\n | 4,813\n | 152,500\n | 1994\n | 6,184\n | 196,000\n |\n| 1970\n | 5,187\n | 164,400\n | 1995\n | 4,887\n | 154,900\n |\n| 1971\n | 5,810\n | 184,100\n | 1996\n | 5,685\n | 180,300\n |\n| 1972\n | 5,735\n | 181,700\n | 1997\n | 5,336\n | 169,200\n |\n| 1973\n | 5,723\n | 181,350\n | 1998\n | 4,713\n | 149,400\n |\n| 1974\n | 6,084\n | 192,800\n | 1999\n | 5,860\n | 185,100\n |\n| 1975\n | 6,122\n | 194,000\n | 2000\n | 5,735\n | 181,800\n |\n| 1976\n | 5,885\n | 186,500\n | 2001\n | 5,536\n | 175,500\n |\n| 1977\n | 5,561\n | 176,200\n | 2002\n | 5,598\n | 177,500\n |\n| 1978\n | 5,660\n | 179,400\n | 2003\n | 5,387\n | 170,800\n |\n| 1979\n | 5,350\n | 169,500\n | 2004\n | 5,207\n | 165,100\n |\n| 1980\n | 4,563\n | 144,600\n | 2005\n | 5,104\n | 161,800\n |\n| 1981\n | 4,838\n | 153,300\n | 2006\n | 5,825\n | 184,700\n |\n| 1982\n | 5,760\n | 182,500\n | 2007\n | 5,490\n | 174,100\n |\n| 1983\n | 4,538\n | 143,800\n | 2008\n | 6,090\n | 193,000\n |\n| 1984\n | 5,536\n | 175,400\n | 2009\n | 6,264\n | 198,500\n |\n| 1985\n | 5,187\n | 164,400\n | 2010\n | 5,233\n | 165,800\n |\n| 1986\n | 5,785\n | 183,300\n | 2011\n | 5,568\n | 176,400\n |\n| 1987\n | 5,261\n | 166,700\n | 2012\n | 5,877\n | 186,200\n |\n| 1988\n | 5,286\n | 167,500\n | 2013\n | 6,083\n | 192,800\n |\n| 1989\n | 6,284\n | 199,100\n | 2014\n | 6,212\n | 196,850\n |\n| 1990\n | 5,324\n | 168,700\n | 2015\n | 5,890\n | 186,650\n |\n| 1991\n | 5,424\n | 171,900\n | 2016\n | 5,025\n | 159,200\n |\n| 1992\n | 4,390\n | 139,100\n | 2017\n | 5,710\n | 180,900\n |\n| 1993\n | 5,710\n | 180,900\n | 2018\n | 5,685\n | 180,150\n |\n\n\nAverage discharge (Q - 173,000 m3/s) and sediment load (S - 754 x 106 ton/year) at \u00d3bidos gauge station (period from 1996 to 2007)[70]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Q\n | S\n | Year\n | Q\n | S\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1996\n | 180,300\n | 672\n | 2002\n | 177,500\n | 802\n |\n| 1997\n | 169,200\n | 691\n | 2003\n | 170,800\n | 832\n |\n| 1998\n | 149,400\n | 652\n | 2004\n | 165,100\n | 807\n |\n| 1999\n | 185,800\n | 732\n | 2005\n | 161,800\n | 797\n |\n| 2000\n | 181,800\n | 692\n | 2006\n | 184,700\n | 742\n |\n| 2001\n | 175,500\n | 787\n | 2007\n | 174,100\n | 842\n |\n\n\nAverage, minimum and maximum discharge at Itacoatiara and Santar\u00e9m (Lower Amazon).

Many branches begin flooding in November and might continue to rise until June. The rise of the Rio Negro starts in February or March and begins to recede in June. The Madeira River rises and falls two months earlier than most of the rest of the Amazon river.\n\n\nThe depth of the Amazon between Manacapuru and \u00d3bidos has been calculated as between 20 and 26\u00a0m (66 and 85\u00a0ft). At Manacapuru, the Amazon's water level is only about 24\u00a0m (79\u00a0ft) above mean sea level. More than half of the water in the Amazon downstream of Manacapuru is below sea level.[74] In its lowermost section, the Amazon's depth averages 20 to 50\u00a0m (66 to 164\u00a0ft), in some places as much as 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft).[75]\n\n\nThe main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to Manaus, 1,500\u00a0km (930\u00a0mi) upriver from the mouth. Smaller ocean vessels below 9000 tons and with less than 5.5\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft) draft can reach as far as Iquitos, Peru, 3,600\u00a0km (2,200\u00a0mi) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780\u00a0km (480\u00a0mi) higher, as far as Achual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently ascend to the Pongo de Manseriche, just above Achual Point in Peru.[60]\n\n\nAnnual flooding occurs in late northern latitude winter at high tide when the incoming waters of the Atlantic are funnelled into the Amazon delta. The resulting undular tidal bore is called the *pororoca*, with a leading wave that can be up to 7.6\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft) high and travel up to 800\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) inland.[76][77]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon River originated as a transcontinental river in the Miocene epoch between 11.8 million and 11.3 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 2.4 million years ago in the Early Pleistocene.\n\n\nThe proto-Amazon during the Cretaceous flowed west, as part of a proto-Amazon-Congo river system, from the interior of present-day Africa when the continents were connected, forming western Gondwana. 80 million years ago, the two continents split. Fifteen million years ago, the main tectonic uplift phase of the Andean chain started. This tectonic movement is caused by the subduction of the Nazca Plate underneath the South American Plate. The rise of the Andes and the linkage of the Brazilian and Guyana bedrock shields,[*clarification needed*] blocked the river and caused the Amazon Basin to become a vast inland sea. Gradually, this inland sea became a massive swampy, freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater.[78]\n\n\nEleven to ten million years ago, waters worked through the sandstone from the west and the Amazon began to flow eastward, leading to the emergence of the Amazon rainforest. During glacial periods, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river, which would eventually become the disputed world's longest, draining the most extensive area of rainforest on the planet.[79]\n\n\nParalleling the Amazon River is a large aquifer, dubbed the Hamza River, the discovery of which was made public in August 2011.[80]\n\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Country\n | Coordinates\n | Image\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve | Peru | 3\u00b056\u2032S 73\u00b033\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff3.933\u00b0S 73.550\u00b0W\ufeff / -3.933; -73.550 | ![](image) | [81]\n |\n| Amacayacu National Park | Colombia | 3\u00b029\u2032S 72\u00b012\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff3.483\u00b0S 72.200\u00b0W\ufeff / -3.483; -72.200 | ![](image) | [82]\n |\n| Amaz\u00f4nia National Park | Brazil | 4\u00b026\u2032S 56\u00b050\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff4.433\u00b0S 56.833\u00b0W\ufeff / -4.433; -56.833 | ![](image) | [83]\n |\n| Anavilhanas National Park | Brazil | 2\u00b023\u2032S 60\u00b055\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff2.383\u00b0S 60.917\u00b0W\ufeff / -2.383; -60.917 | ![](image) | [84]\n |\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Biodiversity of Colombia \u00a7\u00a0Amazon natural region\n\n### Flora[edit]\n\n\nSee also the categories Flora of the Amazon and Trees of the Amazon rainforest\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The tambaqui, an important species in Amazonian fisheries, breeds in the Amazon River\nSee also: Category:Fauna of the Amazon\n\nMore than one-third of all known species in the world live in the Amazon rainforest.[85] It is the richest tropical forest in the world in terms of biodiversity.[86] In addition to thousands of species of fish, the river supports crabs, algae, and turtles.\n\n\n\n#### Mammals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon river dolphin\nAlong with the Orinoco, the Amazon is one of the main habitats of the *boto*, also known as the Amazon river dolphin (*Inia geoffrensis*).

The dolphins use echolocation to navigate and hunt in the river's tricky depths.[87] The *boto* is the subject of a legend in Brazil about a dolphin that turns into a man and seduces maidens by the riverside.[88]\n\n\nThe tucuxi (*Sotalia fluviatilis*), also a dolphin species, is found both in the rivers of the Amazon basin and in the coastal waters of South America. The Amazonian manatee (*Trichechus inunguis*), also known as \"seacow\", is found in the northern Amazon River basin and its tributaries. It is a mammal and a herbivore. Its population is limited to freshwater habitats, and, unlike other manatees, it does not venture into saltwater. It is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[89]\n\n\nThe Amazon and its tributaries are the main habitat of the giant otter (*Pteronura brasiliensis*).[90] Sometimes known as the \"river wolf,\" it is one of South America's top carnivores. Because of habitat destruction and hunting, its population has dramatically decreased. It is now listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which effectively bans international trade.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Reptiles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Green anaconda is the heaviest and one of the longest known extant snake species\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(February 2017)*\n |\n\n\nThe Anaconda is found in shallow waters in the Amazon basin. One of the world's largest species of snake, the anaconda spends most of its time in the water with just its nostrils above the surface. Species of caimans, that are related to alligators and other crocodilians, also inhabit the Amazon as do varieties of turtles.[92]\n\n\n\n#### Birds[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Birds of the Amazon rainforest\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(February 2017)*\n |\n\n\n#### Fish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Characins, such as the piranha species, are prey for the giant otter, but these aggressive fish may also pose a danger to humans.\n![](image)Neon tetra is one of the most popular aquarium fish\nThe Amazonian fish fauna is the centre of diversity for neotropical fishes, some of which are popular aquarium specimens like the neon tetra and the freshwater angelfish. More than 5,600 species were known as of 2011[update], and approximately fifty new species are discovered each year.[93][94] The arapaima, known in Brazil as the *pirarucu*, is a South American tropical freshwater fish, one of the largest freshwater fish in the world, with a length of up to 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m).[95] Another Amazonian freshwater fish is the arowana (or *aruan\u00e3* in Portuguese), such as the silver arowana (*Osteoglossum bicirrhosum*), which is a predator and very similar to the arapaima, but only reaches a length of 120\u00a0cm (47\u00a0in). Also present in large numbers is the notorious piranha, an omnivorous fish that congregates in large schools and may attack livestock. There are approximately 30 to 60 species of piranha. The candir\u00fa, native to the Amazon River, is a species of parasitic fresh water catfish in the family Trichomycteridae,[96] just one of more than 1200 species of catfish in the Amazon basin. Other catfish 'walk' overland on their ventral fins,[97] while the kumakuma (*Brachyplatystoma filamentosum*), aka *piraiba* or \"goliath catfish\", can reach 3.6\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) in length and 200\u00a0kg (440\u00a0lb) in weight.[98]\n\n\nThe electric eel (*Electrophorus electricus*) and more than 100 species of electric fishes (Gymnotiformes) inhabit the Amazon basin. River stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) are also known. The bull shark (*Carcharhinus leucas*) has been reported 4,000\u00a0km (2,500\u00a0mi) up the Amazon River at Iquitos in Peru.[99]\n\n\n\n#### Butterflies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of butterflies of the Amazon River basin and the Andes\n\n#### Microbiota[edit]\n\n\nFreshwater microbes are generally not very well known, even less so for a pristine ecosystem like the Amazon. Recently, metagenomics has provided answers to what kind of microbes inhabit the river.[100] The most important microbes in the Amazon River are Actinomycetota, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Thermoproteota.\n\n\n\n## Challenges[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon River, servas a vital lifeline for more than 47 million people in its basin, faces a multitude of challenges that threaten both its ecosystem and the indigenous communities dependent on its resources. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Yanomami, a tribe of approximately 29,000, struggles to preserve their land, culture, and traditional way of life due to encroaching illegal gold miners, malnutrition, and malaria. Meanwhile, the region's severe drought, has led to a devastating increase in water temperatures, reaching 39.1 degrees Celsius, causing the tragic demise of 125 Amazon river dolphins.[101] This unfortunate event serves as a poignant marker of the deteriorating environmental conditions, indicating the increasing vulnerability of the river's ecosystem. Amazon River has experienced historically low water levels, the lowest in over a century. Brazil, the primary custodian of this invaluable natural resource, grapples with the challenges of mitigating the effects of this drought on communities and ecosystems, further emphasizing the urgency of sustainable environmental management and conservation efforts. [102]\n\n\n\n## Major tributaries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Solim\u00f5es, the section of the upper Amazon River\n![](image)Aerial view of an Amazon tributary\nThe Amazon has over 1,100 tributaries, twelve of which are over 1,500\u00a0km (930\u00a0mi) long.[103] Some of the more notable ones are:\n\n\n\n* Branco\n* Casiquiare canal\n* Caquet\u00e1\n* Huallaga\n* Putumayo (or I\u00e7\u00e1 River)\n*

7,025\u00a0km (3,899 and 4,365\u00a0mi).[3]\nThe length measurements of many rivers are only approximations and differ from each other because there are many factors that determine the calculated river length, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n2. **^** The Nile is usually said to be the longest river in the world, with a length of about 6,650 km,[17] and the Amazon the second longest river in the world, with a length of at least 6,400 km.[2] In 2007 and 2008, some scientists claimed that the Amazon has a length of 6,992\u00a0km and was longer than the Nile, whose length was calculated as 6,853\u00a0km.[18][19] They achieved this result by adding the waterway from the Amazon's southern outlet through tidal canals and the Par\u00e1 estuary of the Tocantins.[*citation needed*]\nA peer-reviewed article, published in 2009, states a length of 7,088 km for the Nile and 6,575 km for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, as of 2020, the length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Amazon River at GEOnet Names Server\n2. ^ ***a***

Determining the origin of the Amazon River has evoked broad debates among scholars, explorers, and travelers all over the world. Different definitions of a river's source have been used and continue to be used. Generally, four main criteria can be applied to determine the main source of a river: source flow rate, source length, watershed area of the source, and an altitude of its spring.[2] At present, the Amazon River is not considered to have one unique source but a number of headstream areas. These are headwaters of three different Peruvian rivers that can be found in the high Andes: the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, the Apur\u00edmac, and the Mantaro.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon River is the largest river in the world in terms of its flow rate. In addition, it is the second longest river, measuring 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi)[3] from its source to the mouth of the Atlantic Ocean[4] after the Nile River which is considered to be the longest river in the world (see Source of the Nile River), although there is some dispute. About halfway through its length, upstream from the city of Iquitos, Peru, the Amazon divides into the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n and Ucayali Rivers. Both of these rivers have been considered the main sources of the Amazon so far. The Mara\u00f1\u00f3n has the higher flow rate, while the Ucayali is longer. In the Ucayali basin are the two farthest sources of the Amazon, the Apur\u00edmac and Mantaro Rivers.[5]\n\n\nThe Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Mantaro and Apur\u00edmac Rivers originate in the high mountain area of the Peruvian Andes at altitudes over 5,000 metres (16,000\u00a0ft). All three sources are considered to be the source of the Amazon, but from different points of view. The Mara\u00f1\u00f3n can be considered as the main source of the Amazon based on its discharge, but the Ucayali and its tributaries are longer\u20142,738 kilometres (1,701\u00a0mi) compared to 1,415 kilometres (879\u00a0mi) of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n.[6][7] The main source of the Amazon River is therefore difficult to determine, so it is correct to talk about several of its source areas.\n\n\n\n## The Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River headwaters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River is formed by the union of the Nupe River (right) and the Lauricocha River (center) at an elevation of 10,882 feet (3,317\u00a0m).\nThe source of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River had been considered the main source of the Amazon River for a number of centuries. This source was determined by a Czech Jesuit priest named Father Samuel Fritz who sailed the Amazon River from its mouth upstream and drew the first map of the Amazon River basin. His map from 1707 shows the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River as larger than the Ucayali River, and thus the main source of the Amazon River. Fritz believed that the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n contributed the most water of all the Amazon's tributaries, making it the most important headstream. He pinpointed the source of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River as Lake Lauricocha in the high Western Andes.[8][9] This lake (10\u00b018\u203247\u2033S 76\u00b041\u203246\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff10.313\u00b0S 76.696\u00b0W\ufeff / -10.313; -76.696) is located at an altitude of 3,856 metres (12,651\u00a0ft). The Lauricocha River issuing from Lake Lauricocha joins the Nupe River 22 kilometres (14\u00a0mi) north of the lake near the town of Rondos and the union of the two small rivers forms what is afterwards known as the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River.[10]\n\n\nFritz's claim about the main source of the Amazon River was unchallenged for nearly 200 years. In the late 19th century, an Italian-born Peruvian geographer and scientist Antonio Raimondi proposed that the Nupe River, which he said was a longer and more voluminous river than the Lauricocha River, is the main head stream.[11][12] The Nupe River has its origin in a system of small lakes near one of the highest peaks of the Huayhuash Range called Siula Grande. The uppermost lake 4,351 metres (14,275\u00a0ft) is called Quesillococha (10\u00b016\u203255\u2033S 76\u00b052\u203208\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff10.282\u00b0S 76.869\u00b0W\ufeff / -10.282; -76.869).[13]\n\n\nHalf a century later, in 1952, two Englishmen, Sebastian Snow and John Brown, identified a small glacial lake called Ni\u00f1ococha, as the source of the Amazon River. The stream from this lake, located in the Raura mountain range, flows down through the Raura silver mine to Lake Lauricocha. Afterwards, Snow went down the Amazon River all the way to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.[14] Lake Ni\u00f1ococha (10\u00b027\u203229\u2033S 76\u00b045\u203250\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff10.458\u00b0S 76.764\u00b0W\ufeff / -10.458; -76.764) is located at an altitude of 4,964 metres (16,286\u00a0ft).[15]\n\n\n\n## The Apur\u00edmac River headwaters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Climate station in the Amazon River headwaters near Nevado Mismi at the altitude of 5.280 m a.s.l.\nIn the 1930s attention turned to the headwaters of the Apur\u00edmac River. In 1935, Lake Vilafro (15\u00b012\u203211\u2033S 71\u00b052\u203248\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff15.203\u00b0S 71.880\u00b0W\ufeff / -15.203; -71.880), located at an altitude of 4,674 metres (15,335\u00a0ft)[16] was identified as the main source of the Amazon River. In 1969, Carlos Pe\u00f1aherrera del Aguila, a prominent Peruvian geographer, was the first to label the Carhuasanta River (and the Lloqueta River) flowing down the Mismi Mountain in southern Peru as a possible ultimate source.[17] Two years later the eleven million dollar \"Cousteau Amazon Expedition\" examined the question, culminating in a six-hour television documentary entitled \"Cousteau's Amazon\", which was released in 1983. This expedition was broken into three separate groups and the upper Amazon section was covered by \"The Flying Expedition\" tasked with exploring the upper third from the river's origin on Mt. Mismi. The expedition utilised newly developed satellite imagery, measured by an American cartographic organization to determine the furthest point of flowing water to its meeting the Atlantic Ocean. The Upper Amazon expedition included an Eastern European multi-axled articulated Land Rover, a float plane Papagaiu, for aerial reconnaissance, and the Peruvian Air Force who offered a high elevation helicopter to examine the upper levels of the Chila mountain range and Mt. Mismi.\n\n\nCousteau dispatched a team of German alpinists to summit the 18,000 feet (5,486 m) volcano and during their descent they found melt water dropping into a fissure. This deep cleft in the southern slope of Mismi varied in size from two meters to half a meter wide, angling down the slope. The stream within flowed nearly fifty meters before disappearing, becoming ground water, then emerging lower downstream to continue its course. Within this fissure, the water was deep enough to float a small craft presenting the expedition with an opportunity to navigate the highest and furthest origin of the Amazon. Cousteau brought American, Olympic trained kayaker Caril Ridley to the mountain, who with expedition support ascended the mountain from a small pampas lake, using a Llama train bearing ropes, kayak and equipment, and in June, 1982 became the first person to run the origins of the Amazon.\n\n\nLater expeditions have refined our understanding of the river's many tributaries and meandering flow with its many-disputed origins. The definition of a \"rivers origin\" remains subject of debate by communities, organizations, expeditions and adventurers seeking to claim the prize. But this small lake at the northern foot of Mismi with its high elevation crevasse remains the most likely candidate.\n\n\nA National Geographic Society expedition led by Loren McIntyre identified a small lake 15\u00b030\u203258\u2033S 71\u00b041\u203231\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff15.516\u00b0S 71.692\u00b0W\ufeff / -15.516; -71.692, 5,319 metres (17,451\u00a0ft)[18] on the northern slope of the Mismi Mountain as the main source.[19] This lake, named Lake McIntyre, later incorrectly appeared on some maps as \"Laguna Bohemia\". The real Laguna Bohemia 15\u00b030\u203243\u2033S 71\u00b042\u203207\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff15.512\u00b0S 71.702\u00b0W\ufeff / -15.512; -71.702, 5,148 metres (16,890\u00a0ft)[20] was later identified by a Czech-Peruvian expedition led by Bohum\u00edr Jansk\u00fd as one of the main sources of the Amazon.[21]\n\n\nOther expeditions were led to this area. In 1996, Polish-born Jacek Palkiewicz and Peruvian Zaniel I. Novoa Goicochea refuted Lake McIntyre and identified a small spring beneath a cliff in the catchment of the Apacheta River near Nevado Choquecorao 15\u00b031\u203216\u2033S 71\u00b045\u203240\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff15.521\u00b0S 71.761\u00b0W\ufeff / -15.521; -71.761, 5,182 metres (17,001\u00a0ft) [22] as the main source.[23] Their argument was that the Apacheta is larger and longer than the Carhuasanta. However, this argument was later refuted. After the confluence of the Carhuasanta and Apacheta Rivers, the Lloqueta River originates.\n\n\nIn 1999\u20132000, a Czech scientific team led by Bohum\u00edr Jansk\u00fd from the Charles University in Prague, linked to the opinion of Carlos Pe\u00f1aherrera del Aguila, cooperated with him and named the Carhuasanta River the main source of the Amazon. In 2011 Jansk\u00fd and his team published the results of a years-long project documenting their claim. They described four streams (Carhuasanta, Apacheta, Sillanque and Ccaccansa) forming the Lloqueta River in great detail. Based on these outcomes, the Carhuasanta River is the longest and has the largest drainage area. They identified two sources of the Carhuasanta River, Laguna Bohemia (or Lake Bohemia) and so-called Rocky Spring.[24] In order to monitor the hydrological conditions and have further evidence to support the claim, Jansk\u00fd's team has since installed a number of hydrological and climatic stations in this area. Present research confirms their claim of the Carhuasanta River as the main source of the Amazon in the sense of the highest uninterrupted flow rate. By 2007, all glaciers in the area of Lloqueta River headwaters disappeared as a consequence of ongoing climate change. This fact resulted in a change of local hydrological conditions but the two identified sources remain uninterrupted.[25]\n\n\n\n* ![Map of the Amazon River drainage basin with the Amazon River highlighted](image)\n\nMap of the Amazon River drainage basin with the Amazon River highlighted\n* ![The Apur\u00edmac source of the Amazon.](image)\n\nThe Apur\u00edmac source of the Amazon.\n* ![Amazon River headwaters map](image)\n\nAmazon River headwaters map\n* ![Carhuasanta Rocky Spring](image)\n\nCarhuasanta Rocky Spring\n* ![Carhuasanta Laguna Bohemia](image)\n\nCarhuasanta Laguna Bohemia\n* ![The cross marks a spring, the headwater of the Apacheta River, one of the two sources of the Amazon on the Apur\u00edmac River.](image)\n\nThe cross marks a spring, the headwater of the Apacheta River, one of the two sources of the Amazon on the Apur\u00edmac River.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## The Mantaro River headwaters[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, James Contos and Nicholas Tripcevich came up with a finding that the most distant source of the Amazon is called the Mantaro River. They located the most distant spring in the headwaters of Lake Junin in the Rumi Cruz mountains 10\u00b043\u203255\u2033S 76\u00b038\u203253\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff10.732\u00b0S 76.648\u00b0W\ufeff / -10.732; -76.648, at an elevation of 5,220 metres (17,130\u00a0ft). Contos and Tripcevich calculated and compared the length of the Apur\u00edmac 734.3 kilometres (456.3\u00a0mi) and Mantaro Rivers 809 kilometres (503\u00a0mi) and found that the Mantaro River is about 75 kilometres (47\u00a0mi) longer. Nevertheless, Contos and Tripcevich acknowledge that the flow of the Mantaro River source is interrupted several months a year and thus a drop of water at its source may not complete the journey to the mouth of the Amazon.[26]\n\n\n\n## Headstream areas of the Amazon River[edit]\n\n\nTraditionally, many geographers and explorers have defined a source as the most distant point upstream that provides the largest volume of water to a river. However, this criterion is not easy to employ in the case of most of the world's largest rivers. Depending on which definition or interpretation is preferred, there can certainly be a couple of different answers for the source of a given river.\nThus, a number of headstream areas of the Amazon River should be considered: \n\n\n\n1. the Mara\u00f1on River (the Lauricocha and Nupe Rivers) in a historical context;\n2. the Mantaro River with the most distant but semi-permanent spring;\n3. the Apur\u00edmac River (the Carhuasanta River) with the most distant source of uninterrupted flow.\n\n\n\n\nHistory of claims and hypotheses concerning the Amazon River headwaters\n| Author | Year | Source\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| S.J.

With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains.[17] The main stem is entirely within the United States; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (2,980,000\u00a0km2), of which only about one\u00a0percent is in Canada. The Mississippi ranks as the thirteenth-largest river by discharge in the world. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.[18][19]\n\n\nNative Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years. Most were hunter-gatherers, but some, such as the Mound Builders, formed prolific agricultural and urban civilizations. The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers, then settlers, ventured into the basin in increasing numbers.[20] The river served first as a barrier, forming borders for New Spain, New France, and the early United States, and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link. In the 19th century, during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny, the Mississippi and several western tributaries, most notably the Missouri, formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States.\n\n\nFormed from thick layers of the river's silt deposits, the Mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile regions of the United States; steamboats were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to ship agricultural and industrial goods. During the American Civil War, the Mississippi's capture by Union forces marked a turning point towards victory, due to the river's strategic importance to the Confederate war effort. Because of the substantial growth of cities and the larger ships and barges that replaced steamboats, the first decades of the 20th century saw the construction of massive engineering works such as levees, locks and dams, often built in combination. A major focus of this work has been to prevent the lower Mississippi from shifting into the channel of the Atchafalaya River and bypassing New Orleans.\n\n\nSince the 20th century, the Mississippi River has also experienced major pollution and environmental problems \u2014 most notably elevated nutrient and chemical levels from agricultural runoff, the primary contributor to the Gulf of Mexico dead zone.\n\n\n\n\n## Name and significance[edit]\n\n\nThe word Mississippi itself comes from *Misi zipi*, the French rendering of the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe or Algonquin) name for the river, *Misi-ziibi* (Great River).[21]\n\n\nIn the 18th century, the river was set by the Treaty of Paris as, for the most part, the western border of the new United States. With the Louisiana Purchase and the country's westward expansion, it became a convenient boundary line between the western and eastern halves of the country.[22][23] This is reflected in the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, which was designed to symbolize the opening of the West,[24] and the focus on the \"Trans-Mississippi\" region in the Trans-Mississippi Exposition.[25]\n\n\nRegional landmarks are often classified in relation to the river, such as \"the highest peak east of the Mississippi\"[26] or \"the oldest city west of the Mississippi\".[27] The FCC also uses it as the dividing line for broadcast call-signs, which begin with W to the east and K to the west, overlapping in media markets along the river.\n\n\n\n## Divisions[edit]\n\n\nThe Mississippi River can be divided into three sections: the Upper Mississippi, the river from its headwaters to the confluence with the Missouri River; the Middle Mississippi, which is downriver from the Missouri to the Ohio River; and the Lower Mississippi, which flows from the Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n\n### Upper Mississippi[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Upper Mississippi River\n\n![](image)The source of the Mississippi River at Lake Itasca\n![A log bridge over a very small river on an autumnal, cloudy day with flurries of snow](image)The first bridge (and only log bridge) over the Mississippi, about 25 feet south of its source at Lake Itasca\n![St. Anthony Falls](image)Former head of navigation, St. Anthony Falls, Minneapolis, Minnesota\n![](image)Confluence of the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers, viewed from Wyalusing State Park in Wisconsin\nThe Upper Mississippi runs from its headwaters to its confluence with the Missouri River at St. Louis, Missouri. It is divided into two sections:\n\n\n\n1. The headwaters, 493 miles (793\u00a0km) from the source to Saint Anthony Falls in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and\n2. A navigable channel, formed by a series of man-made lakes between Minneapolis and St. Louis, Missouri, some 664 miles (1,069\u00a0km).\n\n\nBarge on Upper Mississippi North of Lock and Dam No. 8\nThe source of the Upper Mississippi branch is traditionally accepted as Lake Itasca, 1,475 feet (450\u00a0m) above sea level in Itasca State Park in Clearwater County, Minnesota. The name *Itasca* was chosen to designate the \"true head\" of the Mississippi River as a combination of the last four letters of the Latin word for truth (*ver**itas***) and the first two letters of the Latin word for head (***ca**put*).[28] However, the lake is in turn fed by a number of smaller streams.\n\n\nFrom its origin at Lake Itasca to St. Louis, Missouri, the waterway's flow is moderated by 43 dams. Fourteen of these dams are located above Minneapolis in the headwaters region and serve multiple purposes, including power generation and recreation. The remaining 29 dams, beginning in downtown Minneapolis, all contain locks and were constructed to improve commercial navigation of the upper river. Taken as a whole, these 43 dams significantly shape the geography and influence the ecology of the upper river. Beginning just below Saint Paul, Minnesota, and continuing throughout the upper and lower river, the Mississippi is further controlled by thousands of wing dikes that moderate the river's flow in order to maintain an open navigation channel and prevent the river from eroding its banks.\n\n\nThe head of navigation on the Mississippi is the St. Anthony Falls Lock.[29] Before the Coon Rapids Dam in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, was built in 1913, steamboats could occasionally go upstream as far as Saint Cloud, Minnesota, depending on river conditions.\n\n\nThe uppermost lock and dam on the Upper Mississippi River is the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam in Minneapolis. Above the dam, the river's elevation is 799 feet (244\u00a0m). Below the dam, the river's elevation is 750 feet (230\u00a0m). This 49-foot (15\u00a0m) drop is the largest of all the Mississippi River locks and dams. The origin of the dramatic drop is a waterfall preserved adjacent to the lock under an apron of concrete. Saint Anthony Falls is the only true waterfall on the entire Mississippi River. The water elevation continues to drop steeply as it passes through the gorge carved by the waterfall.\n\n\nAfter the completion of the St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam in 1963, the river's head of navigation moved upstream, to the Coon Rapids Dam. However, the Locks were closed in 2015 to control the spread of invasive Asian carp, making Minneapolis once again the site of the head of navigation of the river.[29]\n\n\nThe Upper Mississippi has a number of natural and artificial lakes, with its widest point being Lake Winnibigoshish, near Grand Rapids, Minnesota, over 11 miles (18\u00a0km) across. Lake Onalaska, created by Lock and Dam No. 7, near La Crosse, Wisconsin, is more than 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) wide. Lake Pepin, a natural lake formed behind the delta of the Chippewa River of Wisconsin as it enters the Upper Mississippi, is more than 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) wide.[30]\n\n\nBy the time the Upper Mississippi reaches Saint Paul, Minnesota, below Lock and Dam No. 1, it has dropped more than half its original elevation and is 687 feet (209\u00a0m) above sea level. From St. Paul to St. Louis, Missouri, the river elevation falls much more slowly and is controlled and managed as a series of pools created by 26 locks and dams.[31]\n\n\nThe Upper Mississippi River is joined by the Minnesota River at Fort Snelling in the Twin Cities; the St. Croix River near Prescott, Wisconsin; the Cannon River near Red Wing, Minnesota; the Zumbro River at Wabasha, Minnesota; the Black, La Crosse, and Root rivers in La Crosse, Wisconsin; the Wisconsin River at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin; the Rock River at the Quad Cities; the Iowa River near Wapello, Iowa; the Skunk River south of Burlington, Iowa; and the Des Moines River at Keokuk, Iowa. Other major tributaries of the Upper Mississippi include the Crow River in Minnesota, the Chippewa River in Wisconsin, the Maquoketa River and the Wapsipinicon River in Iowa, and the Illinois River in Illinois.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Upper Mississippi River at its confluence with the Missouri River north of St. Louis\nThe Upper Mississippi is largely a multi-thread stream with many bars and islands. From its confluence with the St. Croix River downstream to Dubuque, Iowa, the river is entrenched, with high bedrock bluffs lying on either side. The height of these bluffs decreases to the south of Dubuque, though they are still significant through Savanna, Illinois. This topography contrasts strongly with the Lower Mississippi, which is a meandering river in a broad, flat area, only rarely flowing alongside a bluff (as at Vicksburg, Mississippi).\n\n\n\n![](image)The confluence of the Mississippi (left) and Ohio (right) rivers at Cairo, Illinois, the demarcation between the Middle and the Lower Mississippi River\n### Middle Mississippi[edit]\n\n\nThe Mississippi River is known as the Middle Mississippi from the Upper Mississippi River's confluence with the Missouri River at St. Louis, Missouri, for 190 miles (310\u00a0km) to its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois.[32][33]\n\n\nThe Middle Mississippi is relatively free-flowing. From St. Louis to the Ohio River confluence, the Middle Mississippi falls 220 feet (67\u00a0m) over 180 miles (290\u00a0km) for an average rate of 1.2 feet per mile (23\u00a0cm/km). At its confluence with the Ohio River, the Middle Mississippi is 315 feet (96\u00a0m) above sea level. Apart from the Missouri and Meramec rivers of Missouri and the Kaskaskia River of Illinois, no major tributaries enter the Middle Mississippi River.\n\n\n\n### Lower Mississippi[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lower Mississippi River\n\n![](image)Lower Mississippi River at Algiers Point in New Orleans\nThe Mississippi River is called the Lower Mississippi River from its confluence with the Ohio River to its mouth at the Gulf of Mexico, a distance of about 1,000 miles (1,600\u00a0km). At the confluence of the Ohio and the Middle Mississippi, the long-term mean discharge of the Ohio at Cairo, Illinois is 281,500 cubic feet per second (7,970 cubic meters per second),[34] while the long-term mean discharge of the Mississippi at Thebes, Illinois (just upriver from Cairo) is 208,200\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s (5,900\u00a0m3/s).[35] Thus, by volume, the main branch of the Mississippi River system at Cairo can be considered to be the Ohio River (and the Allegheny River further upstream), rather than the Middle Mississippi.\n\n\nIn addition to the Ohio River, the major tributaries of the Lower Mississippi River are the White River, flowing in at the White River National Wildlife Refuge in east-central Arkansas; the Arkansas River, joining the Mississippi at Arkansas Post; the Big Black River in Mississippi; and the Yazoo River, meeting the Mississippi at Vicksburg, Mississippi.\n\n\nDeliberate water diversion at the Old River Control Structure in Louisiana allows the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana to be a major distributary of the Mississippi River, with 30% of the combined flow of the Mississippi and Red Rivers flowing to the Gulf of Mexico by this route, rather than continuing down the Mississippi's current channel past Baton Rouge and New Orleans on a longer route to the Gulf.[36][37][38][39] Although the Red River was once an additional tributary, its water now flows separately into the Gulf of Mexico through the Atchafalaya River.[40]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the Mississippi River watershed\nAn animation of the flows along the rivers of the Mississippi watershed\nSee also: List of drainage basins by area\n\nThe Mississippi River has the world's fourth-largest drainage basin (\"watershed\" or \"catchment\"). The basin covers more than 1,245,000 square miles (3,220,000\u00a0km2), including all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. The drainage basin empties into the Gulf of Mexico, part of the Atlantic Ocean. The total catchment of the Mississippi River covers nearly 40% of the landmass of the continental United States. The highest point within the watershed is also the highest point of the Rocky Mountains, Mount Elbert at 14,440 feet (4,400\u00a0m).[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sequence of NASA MODIS images showing the outflow of fresh water from the Mississippi (arrows) into the Gulf of Mexico (2004)\nIn the United States, the Mississippi River drains the majority of the area between the crest of the Rocky Mountains and the crest of the Appalachian Mountains, except for various regions drained to Hudson Bay by the Red River of the North; to the Atlantic Ocean by the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River; and to the Gulf of Mexico by the Rio Grande, the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers, the Chattahoochee and Appalachicola rivers, and various smaller coastal waterways along the Gulf.\n\n\nThe Mississippi River empties into the Gulf of Mexico about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) downstream from New Orleans. Measurements of the length of the Mississippi from Lake Itasca to the Gulf of Mexico vary somewhat, but the United States Geological Survey's number is 2,340 miles (3,766\u00a0km). The retention time from Lake Itasca to the Gulf is typically about 90 days;[42] while speed varies along the course of the river, this gives an overall average of around 26\u00a0mi (42\u00a0km) per day, or 1\u00a0mi (1.6\u00a0km) per hour.\n\n\nThe stream gradient of the entire river is 0.01%, a drop of 450 m over 3,766\u00a0km.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Outflow[edit]\n\n\nThe Mississippi River discharges at an annual average rate of between 200 and 700\u00a0thousand cubic feet per second (6,000 and 20,000\u00a0m3/s).[43] The Mississippi is the fourteenth largest river in the world by volume. On average, the Mississippi has 8% the flow of the Amazon River,[44]\nwhich moves nearly 7\u00a0million cubic feet per second (200,000\u00a0m3/s) during wet seasons.\n\n\nBefore 1900, the Mississippi River transported an estimated 440\u00a0million short tons (400\u00a0million metric tons) of sediment per year from the interior of the United States to coastal Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico. During the last two decades, this number was only 160\u00a0million short tons (145\u00a0million metric tons) per year. The reduction in sediment transported down the Mississippi River is the result of engineering modification of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio rivers and their tributaries by dams, meander cutoffs, river-training structures, and bank revetments and soil erosion control programs in the areas drained by them.[45]\n\n\n\n### Mixing with salt water[edit]\n\n\nDenser salt water from the Gulf of Mexico forms a salt wedge along the river bottom near the mouth of the river, while fresh water flows near the surface. In drought years, with less fresh water to push it out, salt water can travel many miles upstream\u201464 miles (103\u00a0km) in 2022\u2014contaminating drinking water supplies and requiring the use of desalination. The United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed \"saltwater sills\" or \"underwater levees\" to contain this in 1988, 1999, 2012, and 2022. This consists of a large mound of sand spanning the width of the river 55 feet below the surface, allowing fresh water and large cargo ships to pass over.[46]\n\n\nFresh river water flowing from the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico does not mix into the salt water immediately. The images from NASA's MODIS show a large plume of fresh water, which appears as a dark ribbon against the lighter-blue surrounding waters. These images demonstrate that the plume did not mix with the surrounding sea water immediately. Instead, it stayed intact as it flowed through the Gulf of Mexico, into the Straits of Florida, and entered the Gulf Stream. The Mississippi River water rounded the tip of Florida and traveled up the southeast coast to the latitude of Georgia before finally mixing in so thoroughly with the ocean that it could no longer be detected by MODIS.\n\n\n\n## Course changes[edit]\n\n\nOver geologic time, the Mississippi River has experienced numerous large and small changes to its main course, as well as additions, deletions, and other changes among its numerous tributaries, and the lower Mississippi River has used different pathways as its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico across the delta region.\n\n\nAs Pangaea began to break up about 95 million years ago, North America passed over a volcanic \"hotspot\" in the Earth's mantle (specifically, the Bermuda hotspot) that was undergoing a period of intense activity. The upwelling of magma from the hotspot forced the further uplift to a height of perhaps 2\u20133\u00a0km of part of the Appalachian-Ouachita range, forming an arch that blocked southbound water flows. The uplifted land quickly eroded and, as North America moved away from the hot spot and as the hotspot's activity declined, the crust beneath the embayment region cooled, contracted and subsided to a depth of 2.6\u00a0km, and around 80 million years ago the Reelfoot Rift formed a trough that was flooded by the Gulf of Mexico. As sea levels dropped, the Mississippi and other rivers extended their courses into the embayment, which gradually became filled with sediment with the Mississippi River at its center.[47][48]\n\n\nThrough a natural process known as avulsion or delta switching, the lower Mississippi River has shifted its final course to the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico every thousand years or so. This occurs because the deposits of silt and sediment begin to clog its channel, raising the river's level and causing it to eventually find a steeper, more direct route to the Gulf of Mexico. The abandoned distributaries diminish in volume and form what are known as bayous. This process has, over the past 5,000 years, caused the coastline of south Louisiana to advance toward the Gulf from 15 to 50 miles (24 to 80\u00a0km). The currently active delta lobe is called the Birdfoot Delta, after its shape, or the Balize Delta, after La Balize, Louisiana, the first French settlement at the mouth of the Mississippi.\n\n\n\n### Prehistoric courses[edit]\n\n\nThe current form of the Mississippi River basin was largely shaped by the Laurentide Ice Sheet of the most recent Ice Age. The southernmost extent of this enormous glaciation extended well into the present-day United States and Mississippi basin. When the ice sheet began to recede, hundreds of feet of rich sediment were deposited, creating the flat and fertile landscape of the Mississippi Valley. During the melt, giant glacial rivers found drainage paths into the Mississippi watershed, creating such features as the Minnesota River, James River, and Milk River valleys. When the ice sheet completely retreated, many of these \"temporary\" rivers found paths to Hudson Bay or the Arctic Ocean, leaving the Mississippi Basin with many features \"over-sized\" for the existing rivers to have carved in the same time period.\n\n\nIce sheets during the Illinoian Stage, about 300,000 to 132,000 years before present, blocked the Mississippi near Rock Island, Illinois, diverting it to its present channel farther to the west, the current western border of Illinois. The Hennepin Canal roughly follows the ancient channel of the Mississippi downstream from Rock Island to Hennepin, Illinois. South of Hennepin, to Alton, Illinois, the current Illinois River follows the ancient channel used by the Mississippi River before the Illinoian Stage.[49][50]\n\n\n\n![](image)View along the former riverbed at the Tennessee/Arkansas state line near Reverie, Tennessee (2007)\nTimeline of outflow course changes[51]\n\n\n\n* c. 5000 BC: The last ice age ended; world sea level became what it is now.\n* c. 2500 BC: Bayou Teche became the main course of the Mississippi.\n* c. 800 BC: The Mississippi diverted further east.\n* c. 200 AD: Bayou Lafourche became the main course of the Mississippi.\n* c. 1000 AD: The Mississippi's present course took over.\n* Before c. 1400 AD: The Red River of the South flowed parallel to the lower Mississippi to the sea\n* 15th century: Turnbull's Bend in the lower Mississippi extended so far west that it captured the Red River of the South. The Red River below the captured section became the Atchafalaya River.\n* 1831: Captain Henry M. Shreve dug a new short course for the Mississippi through the neck of Turnbull's Bend.\n* 1833 to November 1873: The Great Raft (a huge logjam in the Atchafalaya River) was cleared. The Atchafalaya started to capture the Mississippi and to become its new main lower course.\n* 1963: The Old River Control Structure was completed, controlling how much Mississippi water entered the Atchafalaya.\n\n\n### Historic course changes[edit]\n\n\nIn March 1876, the Mississippi suddenly changed course near the settlement of Reverie, Tennessee, leaving a small part of Tipton County, Tennessee, attached to Arkansas and separated from the rest of Tennessee by the new river channel. Since this event was an avulsion, rather than the effect of incremental erosion and deposition, the state line still follows the old channel.[52]\n\n\nThe town of Kaskaskia, Illinois once stood on a peninsula at the confluence of the Mississippi and Kaskaskia (Okaw) Rivers. Founded as a French colonial community, it later became the capital of the Illinois Territory and was the first state capital of Illinois until 1819. Beginning in 1844, successive flooding caused the Mississippi River to slowly encroach east. A major flood in 1881 caused it to overtake the lower 10 miles (16\u00a0km) of the Kaskaskia River, forming a new Mississippi channel and cutting off the town from the rest of the state. Later flooding destroyed most of the remaining town, including the original State House. Today, the remaining 2,300 acres (930\u00a0ha) island and community of 14 residents is known as an enclave of Illinois and is accessible only from the Missouri side.[53]\n\n\n\n### New Madrid Seismic Zone[edit]\n\n\nThe New Madrid Seismic Zone, along the Mississippi River near New Madrid, Missouri, between Memphis and St. Louis, is related to an aulacogen (failed rift) that formed at the same time as the Gulf of Mexico. This area is still quite active seismically. Four great earthquakes in 1811 and 1812, estimated at 8 on the Richter magnitude scale, had tremendous local effects in the then sparsely settled area, and were felt in many other places in the Midwestern and eastern U.S. These earthquakes created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee from the altered landscape near the river.\n\n\n\n## Length[edit]\n\n\nWhen measured from its traditional source at Lake Itasca, the Mississippi has a length of 2,340 miles (3,766\u00a0km). When measured from its longest stream source (most distant source from the sea), Brower's Spring in Montana, the source of the Missouri River, it has a length of 3,710 miles (5,971\u00a0km), making it the fourth longest river in the world after the Nile, Amazon, and Yangtze.[54] When measured by the largest stream source (by water volume), the Ohio River, by extension the Allegheny River, would be the source, and the Mississippi would begin in Pennsylvania.[55]\n\n\n\n## Depth[edit]\n\n\nAt its source at Lake Itasca, the Mississippi River is about 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) deep. The average depth of the Mississippi River between Saint Paul and Saint Louis is between 9 and 12 feet (2.7\u20133.7\u00a0m) deep, the deepest part being Lake Pepin, which averages 20\u201332 feet (6\u201310\u00a0m) deep and has a maximum depth of 60 feet (18\u00a0m). Between where the Missouri River joins the Mississippi at Saint Louis, Missouri, and Cairo, Illinois, the depth averages 30 feet (9\u00a0m). Below Cairo, where the Ohio River joins, the depth averages 50\u2013100 feet (15\u201330\u00a0m) deep. The deepest part of the river is in New Orleans, where it reaches 200 feet (61\u00a0m) deep.[56][57]\n\n\n\n## Cultural geography[edit]\n\n\n### State boundaries[edit]\n\n\nThe Mississippi River runs through or along 10 states, from Minnesota to Louisiana, and is used to define portions of these states borders, with Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi along the east side of the river, and Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansas along its west side. Substantial parts of both Minnesota and Louisiana are on either side of the river, although the Mississippi defines part of the boundary of each of these states.\n\n\nIn all of these cases, the middle of the riverbed at the time the borders were established was used as the line to define the borders between adjacent states.[58][59] In various areas, the river has since shifted, but the state borders have not changed, still following the former bed of the Mississippi River as of their establishment, leaving several small isolated areas of one state across the new river channel, contiguous with the adjacent state. Also, due to a meander in the river, a small part of western Kentucky is contiguous with Tennessee but isolated from the rest of its state.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nLake Pepin, the widest naturally occurring part of the Mississippi, is part of the Minnesota\u2013Wisconsin border.\n\n![](image)\nThe Mississippi River in downtown Baton Rouge\n\n### Communities along the river[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Metro Area\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul | 3,946,533\n |\n| St. Louis | 2,916,447\n |\n| Memphis | 1,316,100\n |\n| New Orleans | 1,214,932\n |\n| Baton Rouge | 802,484\n |\n| Quad Cities, IA-IL | 387,630\n |\n| St. Cloud, MN | 189,148\n |\n| La Crosse, WI | 133,365\n |\n| Cape Girardeau\u2013Jackson MO-IL | 96,275\n |\n| Dubuque, IA | 93,653\n |\n\n\n![](image)In Minnesota, the Mississippi River runs through the Twin Cities (2007)\n![](image)Community of boathouses on the Mississippi River in Winona, MN (2006)\n![](image)The Mississippi River at the Chain of Rocks just north of St. Louis (2005)\n![](image)A low-water dam deepens the pool above the Chain of Rocks Lock near St. Louis (2006)\nMany of the communities along the Mississippi River are listed below; most have either historic significance or cultural lore connecting them to the river.

It spanned the river in Minneapolis where the current Hennepin Avenue Bridge is located.[61] No highway or railroad tunnels cross under the Mississippi River.\n\n\nThe first railroad bridge across the Mississippi was built in 1856. It spanned the river between the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois and Davenport, Iowa. Steamboat captains of the day, fearful of competition from the railroads, considered the new bridge a hazard to navigation. Two weeks after the bridge opened, the steamboat *Effie Afton* rammed part of the bridge, setting it on fire. Legal proceedings ensued, with Abraham Lincoln defending the railroad. The lawsuit went to the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled in favor of the railroad.[62]\n\n\nBelow is a general overview of selected Mississippi bridges that have notable engineering or landmark significance, with their cities or locations.

The task of maintaining a navigation channel is the responsibility of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which was established in 1802.[65] Earlier projects began as early as 1829 to remove snags, close off secondary channels and excavate rocks and sandbars.\n\n\n\n![](image)Oil tanker on the Lower Mississippi near the Port of New Orleans\n![](image)Barge on the Lower Mississippi River\nA series of 29 locks and dams on the upper Mississippi, most of which were built in the 1930s, is designed primarily to maintain a 9-foot-deep (2.7\u00a0m) channel for commercial barge traffic.[66][67] The lakes formed are also used for recreational boating and fishing. The dams make the river deeper and wider but do not stop it. No flood control is intended. During periods of high flow, the gates, some of which are submersible, are completely opened and the dams simply cease to function. Below St. Louis, the Mississippi is relatively free-flowing, although it is constrained by numerous levees and directed by numerous wing dams. The scope and scale of the levees, built along either side of the river to keep it on its course, has often been compared to the Great Wall of China.[36]\n\n\nOn the lower Mississippi, from Baton Rouge to the mouth of the Mississippi, the navigation depth is 45 feet (14\u00a0m), allowing container ships and cruise ships to dock at the Port of New Orleans and bulk cargo ships shorter than 150-foot (46\u00a0m) air draft that fit under the Huey P. Long Bridge to traverse the Mississippi to Baton Rouge.[68] There is a feasibility study to dredge this portion of the river to 50 feet (15\u00a0m) to allow New Panamax ship depths.[69]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lock and Dam No. 11, north of Dubuque, Iowa (2007)\nIn 1829, there were surveys of the two major obstacles on the upper Mississippi, the Des Moines Rapids and the Rock Island Rapids, where the river was shallow and the riverbed was rock. The Des Moines Rapids were about 11 miles (18\u00a0km) long and just above the mouth of the Des Moines River at Keokuk, Iowa. The Rock Island Rapids were between Rock Island and Moline, Illinois. Both rapids were considered virtually impassable.\n\n\nIn 1848, the Illinois and Michigan Canal was built to connect the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan via the Illinois River near Peru, Illinois. The canal allowed shipping between these important waterways. In 1900, the canal was replaced by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. The second canal, in addition to shipping, also allowed Chicago to address specific health issues (typhoid fever, cholera and other waterborne diseases) by sending its waste down the Illinois and Mississippi river systems rather than polluting its water source of Lake Michigan.\n\n\nThe Corps of Engineers recommended the excavation of a 5-foot-deep (1.5\u00a0m) channel at the Des Moines Rapids, but work did not begin until after Lieutenant Robert E. Lee endorsed the project in 1837. The Corps later also began excavating the Rock Island Rapids. By 1866, it had become evident that excavation was impractical, and it was decided to build a canal around the Des Moines Rapids. The canal opened in 1877, but the Rock Island Rapids remained an obstacle. In 1878, Congress authorized the Corps to establish a 4.5-foot-deep (1.4\u00a0m) channel to be obtained by building wing dams that direct the river to a narrow channel causing it to cut a deeper channel, by closing secondary channels and by dredging. The channel project was complete when the Moline Lock, which bypassed the Rock Island Rapids, opened in 1907.\n\n\nTo improve navigation between St. Paul, Minnesota, and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, the Corps constructed several dams on lakes in the headwaters area, including Lake Winnibigoshish and Lake Pokegama. The dams, which were built beginning in the 1880s, stored spring run-off which was released during low water to help maintain channel depth.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lock and Dam No. 2, near Hastings, Minnesota (2007)\n![](image)Lock and Dam No. 15, is the largest roller dam in the world Davenport, Iowa; Rock Island, Illinois. (1990)\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1907, Congress authorized a 6-foot-deep (1.8\u00a0m) channel project on the Mississippi River, which was not complete when it was abandoned in the late 1920s in favor of the 9-foot-deep (2.7\u00a0m) channel project.\n\n\nIn 1913, construction was complete on Lock and Dam No. 19 at Keokuk, Iowa, the first dam below St. Anthony Falls. Built by a private power company (Union Electric Company of St. Louis) to generate electricity (originally for streetcars in St. Louis), the Keokuk dam was one of the largest hydro-electric plants in the world at the time. The dam also eliminated the Des Moines Rapids. Lock and Dam No. 1 was completed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1917. Lock and Dam No. 2, near Hastings, Minnesota, was completed in 1930.\n\n\nBefore the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the Corps's primary strategy was to close off as many side channels as possible to increase the flow in the main river. It was thought that the river's velocity would scour off bottom sediments, deepening the river and decreasing the possibility of flooding. The 1927 flood proved this to be so wrong that communities threatened by the flood began to create their own levee breaks to relieve the force of the rising river.\n\n\nThe Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930 authorized the 9-foot (2.7\u00a0m) channel project, which called for a navigation channel 9 feet (2.7\u00a0m) feet deep and 400 feet (120\u00a0m) wide to accommodate multiple-barge tows.[70][71] This was achieved by a series of locks and dams, and by dredging. Twenty-three new locks and dams were built on the upper Mississippi in the 1930s in addition to the three already in existence.\n\n\n\n![](image)Formation of the Atchafalaya River and construction of the Old River Control Structure.\n![](image)Project design flood flow capacity for the Mississippi river in thousands of cubic feet per second.[72]\nUntil the 1950s, there was no dam below Lock and Dam 26 at Alton, Illinois. Chain of Rocks Lock (Lock and Dam No. 27), which consists of a low-water dam and an 8.4-mile-long (13.5\u00a0km) canal, was added in 1953, just below the confluence with the Missouri River, primarily to bypass a series of rock ledges at St. Louis. It also serves to protect the St. Louis city water intakes during times of low water.\n\n\nU.S. government scientists determined in the 1950s that the Mississippi River was starting to switch to the Atchafalaya River channel because of its much steeper path to the Gulf of Mexico. Eventually, the Atchafalaya River would capture the Mississippi River and become its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico, leaving New Orleans on a side channel. As a result, the U.S. Congress authorized a project called the Old River Control Structure, which has prevented the Mississippi River from leaving its current channel that drains into the Gulf via New Orleans.[73]\n\n\nBecause the large scale of high-energy water flow threatened to damage the structure, an auxiliary flow control station was built adjacent to the standing control station. This $300\u00a0million project was completed in 1986 by the Corps of Engineers. Beginning in the 1970s, the Corps applied hydrological transport models to analyze flood flow and water quality of the Mississippi. Dam 26 at Alton, Illinois, which had structural problems, was replaced by the Mel Price Lock and Dam in 1990. The original Lock and Dam 26 was demolished.\n\n\n\n![](image)Soldiers of the Missouri Army National Guard sandbag the River in Clarksville, Missouri, June 2008, following flooding.\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nThe Corps now actively creates and maintains spillways and floodways to divert periodic water surges into backwater channels and lakes, as well as route part of the Mississippi's flow into the Atchafalaya Basin and from there to the Gulf of Mexico, bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans. The main structures are the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway in Missouri; the Old River Control Structure and the Morganza Spillway in Louisiana, which direct excess water down the west and east sides (respectively) of the Atchafalaya River; and the Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway, also in Louisiana, which directs floodwaters to Lake Pontchartrain (see diagram). Some experts blame urban sprawl for increases in both the risk and frequency of flooding on the Mississippi River.[74]\n\n\nSome of the pre-1927 strategy remains in use today, with the Corps actively cutting the necks of horseshoe bends, allowing the water to move faster and reducing flood heights.[75]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nApproximately 50,000 years ago, the Central United States was covered by an inland sea, which was drained by the Mississippi and its tributaries into the Gulf of Mexico\u2014creating large floodplains and extending the continent further to the south in the process. The soil in areas such as Louisiana was thereafter found to be very rich.[76]\n\n\n\n### Native Americans[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Woodland period, Hopewell tradition, and Mississippian culture\n\nThe area of the Mississippi River basin was first settled by hunting and gathering Native American peoples and is considered one of the few independent centers of plant domestication in human history.[77] Evidence of early cultivation of sunflower, a goosefoot, a marsh elder and an indigenous squash dates to the 4th millennium BC. The lifestyle gradually became more settled after around 1000\u00a0BC during what is now called the Woodland period, with increasing evidence of shelter construction, pottery, weaving and other practices.\n\n\nA network of trade routes referred to as the Hopewell interaction sphere was active along the waterways between about 200 and 500 AD, spreading common cultural practices over the entire area between the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes. A period of more isolated communities followed, and agriculture introduced from Mesoamerica based on the Three Sisters (maize, beans and squash) gradually came to dominate. After around 800 AD there arose an advanced agricultural society today referred to as the Mississippian culture, with evidence of highly stratified complex chiefdoms and large population centers.\n\n\nThe most prominent of these, now called Cahokia, was occupied between about 600 and 1400 AD[78] and at its peak numbered between 8,000 and 40,000 inhabitants, larger than London, England of that time. At the time of first contact with Europeans, Cahokia and many other Mississippian cities had dispersed, and archaeological finds attest to increased social stress.[79][80][81]\n\n\nModern American Indian nations inhabiting the Mississippi basin include Cheyenne, Sioux, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, Ho-Chunk, Fox, Kickapoo, Tamaroa, Moingwena, Quapaw and Chickasaw.\n\n\nThe word *Mississippi* itself comes from *Messipi*, the French rendering of the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe or Algonquin) name for the river, *Misi-ziibi* (Great River).[82][83] The Ojibwe called Lake Itasca *Omashkoozo-zaaga'igan* (Elk Lake) and the river flowing out of it *Omashkoozo-ziibi* (Elk River). After flowing into Lake Bemidji, the Ojibwe called the river *Bemijigamaag-ziibi* (River from the Traversing Lake). After flowing into Cass Lake, the name of the river changes to *Gaa-miskwaawaakokaag-ziibi* (Red Cedar River) and then out of Lake Winnibigoshish as *Wiinibiigoonzhish-ziibi* (Miserable Wretched Dirty Water River), *Gichi-ziibi* (Big River) after the confluence with the Leech Lake River, then finally as *Misi-ziibi* (Great River) after the confluence with the Crow Wing River.[84] After the expeditions by Giacomo Beltrami and Henry Schoolcraft, the longest stream above the juncture of the Crow Wing River and *Gichi-ziibi* was named \"Mississippi River\". The Mississippi River Band of Chippewa Indians, known as the *Gichi-ziibiwininiwag*, are named after the stretch of the Mississippi River known as the *Gichi-ziibi*. The Cheyenne, one of the earliest inhabitants of the upper Mississippi River, called it the *M\u00e1\u02bcxe-\u00e9\u02bcometaa\u02bce* (Big Greasy River) in the Cheyenne language. The Arapaho name for the river is *Beesniic\u00ede*.[85] The Pawnee name is *Kicka\u00e1tit*.[86]\n\n\nThe Mississippi was spelled Mississipi or Missisipi during French Louisiana and was also known as the Rivi\u00e8re Saint-Louis.[87][88][89]\n\n\n\n### European exploration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Discovery of the Mississippi by De Soto A.D. 1541* by William Henry Powell depicts Hernando de Soto and Spanish Conquistadores seeing the Mississippi River for the first time.\n![](image)Map of the French settlements (blue) in North America in 1750, before the French and Indian War (1754 to 1763).\n![](image)c.\u20091681 map of Marquette and Jolliet's 1673 expedition.\n![](image)Route of the Marquette-Jolliete Expedition of 1673\nIn 1519 Spanish explorer Alonso \u00c1lvarez de Pineda became the first recorded European to reach the Mississippi River, followed by Hernando de Soto who reached the river on May 8, 1541, and called it *R\u00edo del Esp\u00edritu Santo* (\"River of the Holy Spirit\"), in the area of what is now Mississippi.[90] In Spanish, the river is called *R\u00edo Mississippi*.[91]\n\n\nFrench explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette began exploring the Mississippi in the 17th century. Marquette traveled with a Sioux Indian who named it *Ne Tongo* (\"Big river\" in Sioux language) in 1673. Marquette proposed calling it the *River of the Immaculate Conception*.\n\n\nWhen Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi Valley in the 17th century, natives guided him to a quicker way to return to French Canada via the Illinois River. When he found the Chicago Portage, he remarked that a canal of \"only half a league\" (less than 2 miles or 3 kilometers) would join the Mississippi and the Great Lakes.[92] In 1848, the continental divide separating the waters of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley was breached by the Illinois and Michigan canal via the Chicago River.[93] This both accelerated the development, and forever changed the ecology of the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes.\n\n\nIn 1682, Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti claimed the entire Mississippi River valley for France, calling the river *Colbert River* after Jean-Baptiste Colbert and the region *La Louisiane*, for King Louis XIV. On March 2, 1699, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville rediscovered the mouth of the Mississippi, following the death of La Salle.[94] The French built the small fort of La Balise there to control passage.[95]\n\n\nIn 1718, about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) upriver, New Orleans was established along the river crescent by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, with construction patterned after the 1711 resettlement on Mobile Bay of Mobile, the capital of French Louisiana at the time.\n\n\nIn 1727, \u00c9tienne Perier begins work, using enslaved African laborers, on the first levees on the Mississippi River.\n\n\n\n### Colonization[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Flood of 1851\n\n![](image)*A Home on the Mississippi* (1871)\nFollowing Britain's victory in the Seven Years War, the Mississippi became the border between the British and Spanish Empires. The Treaty of Paris (1763) gave Great Britain rights to all land east of the Mississippi and Spain rights to land west of the Mississippi. Spain also ceded Florida to Britain to regain Cuba, which the British occupied during the war. Britain then divided the territory into East and West Florida.\n\n\nArticle 8 of the Treaty of Paris (1783) states, \"The navigation of the river Mississippi, from its source to the ocean, shall forever remain free and open to the subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States\". With this treaty, which ended the American Revolutionary War, Britain also ceded West Florida back to Spain to regain the Bahamas, which Spain had occupied during the war. Initial disputes around the ensuing claims of the U.S. and Spain were resolved when Spain was pressured into signing Pinckney's Treaty in 1795. However, in 1800, under duress from Napoleon of France, Spain ceded an undefined portion of West Florida to France in the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso. The United States then secured effective control of the river when it bought the Louisiana Territory from France in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. This triggered a dispute between Spain and the U.S. on which parts of West Florida Spain had ceded to France in the first place, which would decide which parts of West Florida the U.S. had bought from France in the Louisiana Purchase, versus which were unceded Spanish property. Due to ongoing U.S. colonization creating facts on the ground, and U.S. military actions, Spain ceded both West and East Florida in their entirety to the United States in the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty of 1819.\n\n\nThe last serious European challenge to U.S. control of the river came at the conclusion of the War of 1812, when British forces mounted an attack on New Orleans just 15 days after the signing of the Treaty of Ghent. The attack was repulsed by an American army under the command of General Andrew Jackson.\n\n\nIn the Treaty of 1818, the U.S. and Great Britain agreed to fix the border running from the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains along the 49th parallel north. In effect, the U.S. ceded the northwestern extremity of the Mississippi basin to the British in exchange for the southern portion of the Red River basin.\n\n\nSo many settlers traveled westward through the Mississippi river basin, as well as settled in it, that Zadok Cramer wrote a guidebook called *The Navigator*, detailing the features, dangers, and navigable waterways of the area. It was so popular that he updated and expanded it through 12 editions over 25 years.\n\n\n\n![](image)Shifting sand bars made early navigation difficult.\nThe colonization of the area was barely slowed by the three earthquakes in 1811 and 1812, estimated at 8 on the Richter magnitude scale, that were centered near New Madrid, Missouri.\n\n\n\n### Steamboat era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Steamboats of the Mississippi\n\nMark Twain's book, *Life on the Mississippi*, covered the steamboat commerce, which took place from 1830 to 1870, before more modern ships replaced the steamer. *Harper's Weekly* first published the book as a seven-part serial in 1875. James R. Osgood & Company published the full version, including a passage from the then unfinished *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* and works from other authors, in 1885.\n\n\nThe first steamboat to travel the full length of the Lower Mississippi from the Ohio River to New Orleans was the *New Orleans* in December 1811. Its maiden voyage occurred during the series of New Madrid earthquakes in 1811\u201312. The Upper Mississippi was treacherous, unpredictable and to make traveling worse, the area was not properly mapped out or surveyed. Until the 1840s, only two trips a year to the Twin Cities landings were made by steamboats, which suggests it was not very profitable.[96]\n\n\nSteamboat transport remained a viable industry, both in terms of passengers and freight, until the end of the first decade of the 20th century. Among the several Mississippi River system steamboat companies was the noted Anchor Line, which, from 1859 to 1898, operated a luxurious fleet of steamers between St. Louis and New Orleans.\n\n\nItalian explorer Giacomo Beltrami wrote about his journey on the *Virginia*, which was the first steamboat to make it to Fort St. Anthony in Minnesota. He referred to his voyage as a promenade that was once a journey on the Mississippi. The steamboat era changed the economic and political life of the Mississippi, as well as of travel itself. The Mississippi was completely changed by the steamboat era as it transformed into a flourishing tourist trade.[97]\n\n\n\n### Civil War[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mississippi River in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)Battle of Vicksburg (ca.\u00a01888)\n![](image)Mississippi River from Eunice, Arkansas, a settlement destroyed by gunboats during the Civil War.\nControl of the river was a strategic objective of both sides in the American Civil War, forming a part of the U.S. Anaconda Plan. In 1862, Union forces coming down the river successfully cleared Confederate defenses at Island Number 10 and Memphis, Tennessee, while Naval forces coming upriver from the Gulf of Mexico captured New Orleans, Louisiana. One of the last major Confederate strongholds was on the heights overlooking the river at Vicksburg, Mississippi; the Union's Vicksburg Campaign (December 1862\u2013July 1863), and the fall of Port Hudson, completed control of the lower Mississippi River. The Union victory ended the Siege of Vicksburg on July 4, 1863, and was pivotal to the Union's final victory of the Civil War.\n\n\n\n### 20th and 21st centuries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Mississippi River floods\n\nThe \"Big Freeze\" of 1918\u201319 blocked river traffic north of Memphis, Tennessee, preventing transportation of coal from southern Illinois. This resulted in widespread shortages, high prices, and rationing of coal in January and February.[98]\n\n\nIn the spring of 1927, the river broke out of its banks in 145 places, during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and inundated 27,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (70,000\u00a0km2) to a depth of up to 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m).\n\n\nIn 1930, Fred Newton was the first person to swim the length of the river, from Minneapolis to New Orleans. The journey took 176 days and covered 1,836 miles.[99][100]\n\n\nIn 1962 and 1963, industrial accidents spilled 3.5\u00a0million US gallons (13,000\u00a0m3) of soybean oil into the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers. The oil covered the Mississippi River from St. Paul to Lake Pepin, creating an ecological disaster and a demand to control water pollution.[101]\n\n\nOn October 20, 1976, the automobile ferry, *MV George Prince*, was struck by a ship traveling upstream as the ferry attempted to cross from Destrehan, Louisiana, to Luling, Louisiana. Seventy-eight passengers and crew died; only eighteen survived the accident.\n\n\nIn 1988, the water level of the Mississippi fell to 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) below zero on the Memphis gauge. The remains of wooden-hulled water craft were exposed in an area of 4.5 acres (1.8\u00a0ha) on the bottom of the Mississippi River at West Memphis, Arkansas. They dated to the late 19th to early 20th centuries. The State of Arkansas, the Arkansas Archeological Survey, and the Arkansas Archeological Society responded with a two-month data recovery effort. The fieldwork received national media attention as good news in the middle of a drought.[102]\n\n\nThe Great Flood of 1993 was another significant flood, primarily affecting the Mississippi above its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois.\n\n\nTwo portions of the Mississippi were designated as American Heritage Rivers in 1997: the lower portion around Louisiana and Tennessee, and the upper portion around Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin. The Nature Conservancy's project called \"America's Rivershed Initiative\" announced a 'report card' assessment of the entire basin in October 2015 and gave the grade of D+. The assessment noted the aging navigation and flood control infrastructure along with multiple environmental problems.[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Campsite at the river in Arkansas\nIn 2002, Slovenian long-distance swimmer Martin Strel swam the entire length of the river, from Minnesota to Louisiana, over the course of 68 days. In 2005, the Source to Sea Expedition[104] paddled the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers to benefit the Audubon Society's Upper Mississippi River Campaign.[105][106]\n\n\n\n### Future[edit]\n\n\nGeologists believe that the lower Mississippi could take a new course to the Gulf. Either of two new routes\u2014through the Atchafalaya Basin or through Lake Pontchartrain\u2014might become the Mississippi's main channel if flood-control structures are overtopped or heavily damaged during a severe flood.[107][108][109][110][111]\n\n\nFailure of the Old River Control Structure, the Morganza Spillway, or nearby levees would likely re-route the main channel of the Mississippi through Louisiana's Atchafalaya Basin and down the Atchafalaya River to reach the Gulf of Mexico south of Morgan City in southern Louisiana. This route provides a more direct path to the Gulf of Mexico than the present Mississippi River channel through Baton Rouge and New Orleans.[109] While the risk of such a diversion is present during any major flood event, such a change has so far been prevented by active human intervention involving the construction, maintenance, and operation of various levees, spillways, and other control structures by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Old River Control Structure complex. View is to the east-southeast, looking downriver on the Mississippi, with the three dams across channels of the Atchafalaya River to the right of the Mississippi. Concordia Parish, Louisiana is in the foreground, on the right, and Wilkinson County, Mississippi, is in the background, across the Mississippi on the left.\nThe Old River Control Structure, between the present Mississippi River channel and the Atchafalaya Basin, sits at the normal water elevation and is ordinarily used to divert 30% of the Mississippi flow to the Atchafalaya River. There is a steep drop here away from the Mississippi's main channel into the Atchafalaya Basin. If this facility were to fail during a major flood, there is a strong concern the water would scour and erode the river bottom enough to capture the Mississippi's main channel. The structure was nearly lost during the 1973 flood, but repairs and improvements were made after engineers studied the forces at play. In particular, the Corps of Engineers made many improvements and constructed additional facilities for routing water through the vicinity. These additional facilities give the Corps much more flexibility and potential flow capacity than they had in 1973, which further reduces the risk of a catastrophic failure in this area during other major floods, such as that of 2011.\n\n\nBecause the Morganza Spillway is slightly higher and well back from the river, it is normally dry on both sides.[112] Even if it failed at the crest during a severe flood, the floodwaters would have to erode to normal water levels before the Mississippi could permanently jump channel at this location.[113][114] During the 2011 floods, the Corps of Engineers opened the Morganza Spillway to 1/4 of its capacity to allow 150,000 cubic feet per second (4,200\u00a0m3/s) of water to flood the Morganza and Atchafalaya floodways and continue directly to the Gulf of Mexico, bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans.[115] In addition to reducing the Mississippi River crest downstream, this diversion reduced the chances of a channel change by reducing stress on the other elements of the control system.[116]\n\n\nSome geologists have noted that the possibility for course change into the Atchafalaya also exists in the area immediately north of the Old River Control Structure. Army Corps of Engineers geologist Fred Smith once stated, \"The Mississippi wants to go west. 1973 was a forty-year flood. The big one lies out there somewhere\u2014when the structures can't release all the floodwaters and the levee is going to have to give way. That is when the river's going to jump its banks and try to break through.\"[117]\n\n\nAnother possible course change for the Mississippi River is a diversion into Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans. This route is controlled by the Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway, built to reduce flooding in New Orleans. This spillway and an imperfect natural levee about 12\u201320\u00a0ft (3.7\u20136.1\u00a0m) high are all that prevents the Mississippi from taking a new, shorter course through Lake Pontchartrain to the Gulf of Mexico.[118] Diversion of the Mississippi's main channel through Lake Pontchartrain would have consequences similar to an Atchafalaya diversion, but to a lesser extent, since the present river channel would remain in use past Baton Rouge and into the New Orleans area.\n\n\n\n## Recreation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Great River Road in Wisconsin near Lake Pepin (2005)\nThe sport of water skiing was invented on the river in a wide region between Minnesota and Wisconsin known as Lake Pepin.[119] Ralph Samuelson of Lake City, Minnesota, created and refined his skiing technique in late June and early July 1922. He later performed the first water ski jump in 1925 and was pulled along at 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) by a Curtiss flying boat later that year.[119]\n\n\nThere are seven National Park Service sites along the Mississippi River. The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area is the National Park Service site dedicated to protecting and interpreting the Mississippi River itself. The other six National Park Service sites along the river are (listed from north to south):\n\n\n\n* Effigy Mounds National Monument\n* Gateway Arch National Park (includes Gateway Arch)\n* Vicksburg National Military Park\n* Natchez National Historical Park\n* New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park\n* Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mississippi River System \u00a7\u00a0Ecology\n\n![](image)The American paddlefish is an ancient relict from the Mississippi\nThe Mississippi basin is home to a highly diverse aquatic fauna and has been called the \"mother fauna\" of North American freshwater.[120]\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\nAbout 375 fish species are known from the Mississippi basin, far exceeding other North Hemisphere river basins exclusively within temperate/subtropical regions,[120] except the Yangtze.[121] Within the Mississippi basin, streams that have their source in the Appalachian and Ozark highlands contain especially many species. Among the fish species in the basin are numerous endemics, as well as relicts such as paddlefish, sturgeon, gar and bowfin.[120]\n\n\nBecause of its size and high species diversity, the Mississippi basin is often divided into subregions. The Upper Mississippi River alone is home to about 120 fish species, including walleye, sauger, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, white bass, northern pike, bluegill, crappie, channel catfish, flathead catfish, common shiner, freshwater drum, and shovelnose sturgeon.[122][123]\n\n\n\n### Other fauna[edit]\n\n\nA large number of reptiles are native to the river channels and basin, including American alligators, several species of turtle, aquatic amphibians,[124] and cambaridae crayfish, are native to the Mississippi basin.[125]\n\n\nIn addition, approximately 40% of the migratory birds in the US use the Mississippi River corridor during Spring and Fall migrations; 60% of all migratory birds in North America (326 species) use the river basin as their flyway.[126]\n\n\n\n### Introduced species[edit]\n\n\nNumerous introduced species are found in the Mississippi and some of these are invasive. Among the introductions are fish such as Asian carp, including the silver carp that have become infamous for out-competing native fish and their potentially dangerous jumping behavior. They have spread throughout much of the basin, even approaching (but not yet invading) the Great Lakes.[127] The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has designated much of the Mississippi River in the state as infested waters by the exotic species zebra mussels and Eurasian watermilfoil.[128]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Atchafalaya Basin\n* Capes on the Mississippi River\n* Chemetco\n* Great River Road\n* List of crossings of the Lower Mississippi River\n* List of crossings of the Upper Mississippi River\n* List of locks and dams of the Upper Mississippi River\n* List of tributaries of the Mississippi River\n* List of longest rivers of the United States (by main stem)\n* Mississippi embayment\n* Mississippi River floods\n* Mississippi River System\n* *The Waterways Journal Weekly*\n* Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Ojibwe: Misi-ziibi,[8] Dakota: Mn\u00ed\u0161o\u0161eth\u0105ka,[9] Myaamia: Mihsi-siipiiwi,[10] Cheyenne: Ma'xe\u00e9'omet\u0101\u0101'e,[11] Kiowa: X\u00f3s\u00e1u,[12] Arapaho: Beesniicie,[13] Pawnee: Kicka\u00e1tit[14]\n2. **^** Arguably, the Mississippi basin is the second-largest drainage system in North America, second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system, although Hudson Bay may rather be considered an arm of the ocean.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** James L.
