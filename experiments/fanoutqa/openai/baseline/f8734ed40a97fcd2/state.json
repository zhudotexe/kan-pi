He is best known for portraying Ted Mosby on the Emmy Award\u2013winning CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother*. He made his writing and directorial debut with the 2010 comedy drama film *Happythankyoumoreplease*, for which he won the Sundance Film Festival Audience Award and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.\n\n\nIn 2012, he wrote, directed and starred in his second film, *Liberal Arts*, which premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. In 2014, Radnor portrayed Isaac in the Broadway play *Disgraced*, which was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play. He then starred as Dr. Jedediah Foster on the PBS American Civil War drama series *Mercy Street*, Lou Mazzuchelli in the musical series *Rise*, and as Lonny Flash in *Hunters*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRadnor was born in Columbus, Ohio to a Jewish family, the son of Carol Radnor (n\u00e9e Hirsch), a high school guidance counselor, and Alan Radnor, a medical malpractice lawyer.[2] Radnor has two sisters, Melanie Radnor Silverman and Joanna Radnor Vilensky.[3]\n\n\nHe grew up in Bexley, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, and was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4] He attended the Orthodox Jewish day school Columbus Torah Academy before going to Bexley High School[5][6][7] and then Kenyon College, where his school's theater department presented him with the Paul Newman Award and during which he spent a semester (Spring 1995) training at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut. He graduated from Kenyon with a Bachelor of Arts in drama in 1996.[8] Radnor received his Master of Fine Arts degree in acting from New York University's graduate acting program at the Tisch School of the Arts in 1999.[8][9] Radnor participated in an Israel experience program in Tzfat with Livnot U'Lehibanot in 1997.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Radnor and Ben Lee performing\nRadnor was cast as the lead in The WB series *Off Centre*. However, the role was re-cast with Eddie Kaye Thomas before the first episode aired.[10] In 2002, he made his Broadway debut in the stage version of *The Graduate*, succeeding Jason Biggs, opposite Kathleen Turner and Alicia Silverstone. In 2004, Radnor starred in *The Paris Letter* alongside his future *How I Met Your Mother* co-star Neil Patrick Harris.[11] From 2005 to 2014, Radnor starred in *How I Met Your Mother*, his biggest role to date.\n\n\nIn July 2008, he starred opposite Jennifer Westfeldt in the premiere of the play *Finks*,[12] written by Joe Gilford and directed by Charlie Stratton for New York Stage and Film. Radnor made his directorial debut with the film *Happythankyoumoreplease*, where he was both the writer and star of the 2010 comedy-drama.[13]\nHis second directorial effort, *Liberal Arts*, starring himself and Elizabeth Olsen, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2012.[14] Radnor appeared in the Broadway production of *Disgraced*, which opened October 23, 2014, at the Lyceum Theatre.[15][16] He is set to direct the sci-fi thriller film *The Leaves*.[17] Radnor is currently starring in the Amazon Prime series, *Hunters*, as Lonny Flash, and on Netflix's *Centaurworld*, as Durpleton.\n\n\nIn October 2016, Radnor also confirmed he is in a band, Radnor and Lee, with Australian musician Ben Lee. Radnor and Lee had known each other for \"twelve or thirteen years after meeting on the set of *How I Met Your Mother*\" eventually writing songs together.[18] Their debut album, *Radnor & Lee* was released on November 10, 2017,[19] \"receiving widespread praise across the board, and cementing the duo as an accomplished pair of artists,\" stated Rolling Stone.[20] On February 19, 2020, Spin announced Radnor and Lee's sophomore album, *Golden State*, out on Flower Moon Records, and premiered the first single \"Outside In.\"[21] American Songwriter later premiered the video for the album's 2nd single, \"Simple Harmony.\" Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the album's release date was pushed back to June 2020.[22]\n\n\nRadnor's debut solo EP, *One More Then I'll Let You Go,* was released on April 16, 2021, on Flower Moon Records. Rolling Stone premiered the first single, \"The High Road,\" March 10, 2021, calling it a \"gently lilting ballad about the breakdown of a friendship on which he sings... which features deep textures of piano, acoustic guitar, organ, and snapping fingers.\"[23] The EP's 2nd single, \"You Feel New,\" premiered on March 31, 2021, with features in Rolling Stone, NPR, American Songwriter and Paste Magazine.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Radnor told the *Los Angeles Times*, \"I do Transcendental Meditation, and part of the reason I chose my house is that I thought it would be a great place to meditate.\"[25]\n\n\nRadnor is an avid Cloud Cult fan. He collaborated with the band to make the film *The Seeker* in 2016. Radnor explained, \"What's true for me about a lot of music, but especially true for Cloud Cult's music, is that it stirs up the thing that's already in you and calls it out. If this film is able to do that, I'll sleep well at night.\"[26][27]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nKey\n| \u2020\n | Denotes productions that have not yet been released\n |\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | *Not Another Teen Movie* | Tour Guide\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *The Negotiating Table* | WGA Negotiator\n | Short film\n |\n| 2010\n | *Happythankyoumoreplease* | Sam Wexler\n | Also director and writer\n |\n| 2012\n | *Liberal Arts* | Jesse Fisher\n | Also director, writer and producer\n |\n| 2013\n | *Afternoon Delight* | Jeff Boyardee\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *The Galapagos Affair: Satan Came to Eden* | John Garth (voice)\n | Documentary\n |\n| 2016\n | *The Seeker* | Father\n | Also executive producer\n |\n| 2018\n | *Social Animals* | Paul\n |  |\n| 2023\n | *Three Birthdays* | Rob\n |  |\n| 2023\n | *All Happy Families* |  |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000\n | *Welcome to New York* | Doug\n | Episode: \"The Crier\"\n |\n| 2001\n | *Off Centre* | Mike Platt\n | Unaired pilot\n |\n| 2002\n | *Law & Order* | Robert Kitson\n | Episode: \"Access Nation\"\n |\n| 2002\n | *The Court* | Dylan Hirsch\n | 3 episodes\n |\n| 2003\n | *ER* | Keith\n | Episode: \"The Advocate\"\n |\n| 2003\n | *Six Feet Under* | Will Jaffe\n | Episode: \"The Trap\"\n |\n| 2003\n | *Miss Match* | Andrew Gilbert\n | Episode: \"I Got You Babe\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Judging Amy* | Justin Barr\n | Episode: \"Too Little, Too Late\"\n |\n| 2005\u201314\n | *How I Met Your Mother* | Ted Mosby | Main role (208 episodes)\n |\n| 2007, 2009\n | *Family Guy* | Ted Mosby (voice)\n | Episodes: \"No Chris Left Behind\"\"Peter's Progress\"\n |\n| 2013\n | *Malviviendo* | Himself/cameo\n | Episode: \"La cosa est\u00e1 muy negra\"\n |\n| 2016\u201317\n | *Mercy Street* | Dr. Jedediah Foster\n | Main role (12 episodes)\n |\n| 2018\n | *Rise* | Lou Mazzuchelli\n | Main role (10 episodes)\n |\n| 2018\n | *Grey's Anatomy* | John\n | Episode: \"Momma Knows Best\"\n |\n| 2020\u201323\n | *Hunters* | Lonny Flash\n | Main role (18 episodes)\n |\n| 2021\n | *Centaurworld* | Durpleton (voice)\n | Main role (18 episodes)\n |\n| 2022\n | *Fleishman Is in Trouble* | Adam\n | Recurring\n |\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Title | Artist | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016 | \"Let Me Be Your Girl\" | Rachael Yamagata | Director[28] |\n| 2017 | \"Be Like the Being\" | Radnor and Lee | Director\n |\n| 2021 | \"Afternoon\" | Cinders | Director\n |\n\n\n### Stage[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Location\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002\n | *The Graduate* | Benjamin Braddock\n | Plymouth Theatre[29] |\n| 2004\n | *The Paris Letter* | Sam Arlen / Young Sandy\n | Kirk Douglas Theater |\n| 2011\n | *She Loves Me* | Georg Nowack\n | Roundabout Theatre Company[29] |\n| 2014\u20132015\n | *Disgraced* | Isaac\n | Lyceum Theatre |\n| 2016\n | *The Babylon Line* | Aaron Port\n | Lincoln Center\n |\n| 2018\n | *Little Shop of Horrors* | Seymour Krelborn\n | Kennedy Center |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Work\n | Award\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010\n | *Happythankyoumoreplease* | Sundance Film Festival Audience Award | Won\n |\n| Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Award | Nominated\n |\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Radnor and Lee[edit]\n\n\n* *Radnor and Lee* (2017, Gold Village Entertainment)\n* *Golden State* (2020, Flower Moon Records)\n\n\n### Solo[edit]\n\n\n* *One More Then I'll Let You Go* (2021, Flower Moon Records)\n\n\n* *Eulogy, Vol. 1* (2023, Optimal Grip)\n\n\n### Additional appearances[edit]\n\n\n* Paty Cant\u00fa & Josh Radnor \u2013 \"Mirame\" (2020, Universal Music Mexico)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Happy birthday, Josh Radnor: See his star sign and read your horoscope\". *Hello!*.

The series revolved around a group of suburban Detroit high school students circa 1980. Segel personally composed a song for his character, Nick, to sing to the lead female character, Lindsay (Linda Cardellini).[20]\n\n\nSegel had recurring roles on *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* as Neil Jansen and on *Undeclared* as Eric. He played Marshall Eriksen on the CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother*; he had previously stated he would move on to other projects in 2013 when his contract expired,[21] but was convinced to finish the series after its ninth season in 2014.[22]\n\n\nSegel made his film debut with *Can't Hardly Wait* in 1998. His other early feature film appearances include *Slackers*, *SLC Punk!*, *The Good Humor Man*, and *Dead Man on Campus*. In 2007, he appeared in *Knocked Up*, directed by *Freaks and Geeks* producer Judd Apatow. Segel starred in the lead role of 2008's *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, a film he wrote and Apatow produced with Shauna Robertson for Universal Pictures. He also starred in *I Love You, Man*, which was released on March 20, 2009, by DreamWorks.[23]\n\n\nIn *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, Segel's character writes a \"Dracula\" musical performed by puppets. He also appeared in the most prominent scene containing full frontal nudity in the film.[24] In an interview,[25] he stated that the Dracula musical with puppets, as well as being broken up with while naked, were real experiences he wrote into the movie. Those cloth creatures were custom-made by the Jim Henson Company, and the experience emboldened Segel to pitch his concept for a Muppets movie.[26] Segel performed a song from the film, \"Dracula's Lament\", on the 1000th episode of *The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson*.[27]\n\n\n\n![A man smiles as he waves](image)Segel at the Australian premiere of *The Muppets* in Sydney in 2011\nFor the 2010 comedy *Get Him to the Greek*, Segel co-wrote most of the soundtrack's music which was performed by the fictional celebrity singer, Aldous Snow, including Infant Sorrow. He also appeared on *The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson* and sang an original song entitled \"Wonky Eyed Girl\".[28]\n\n\nIn 2010, he voiced Gru's arch-rival Vector in the Universal's CGI animated film, *Despicable Me* and appeared as \"Horatio\" in a fantasy comedy film *Gulliver's Travels* directed by Rob Letterman and very loosely based on Part One of the 18th-century novel of the same name by Jonathan Swift. Segel appeared in *Bad Teacher*, starring Cameron Diaz, which opened in June 2011. He played gym teacher and thwarted suitor Russell Gettis.[29] Along with Nicholas Stoller, Segel approached Disney in 2007 to write the latest *Muppets* film. Disney was unsure on how to take the request, as Segel had just done frontal nudity in *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, but after realizing that he was a fan, the project was approved. Segel stated that he wanted to do the film because the last film in the series to be released in theaters was *Muppets from Space* in 1999, and he felt that the younger generation was missing out on enjoying one of his childhood favorites.[30]\n\n\nSegel decided not to star in the sequel to *The Muppets*, *Muppets Most Wanted*.[31] He filmed *The Five-Year Engagement*, with Emily Blunt, in spring 2011, in Michigan, and the film was released on April 27, 2012.[32]\n\n\nIn 2013, Segel revealed he was working on a series of young adult novels, based on a story he conceived when he was 21.[33] In the fall of 2014, the first novel of the series *Nightmares!*, co-written with Kirsten Miller, was released, with the followup coming out the following year.[34][35]\n\n\nIn 2015, Segel received praise[36][37][38] for his portrayal of the late author David Foster Wallace in the independent biographical drama film *The End of the Tour*. For his performance, he earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead.[39]\n\n\nIn 2017, Segel and Miller released a new book, *Otherworld*, the first of a new young adult series. A second book in the series, *OtherEarth*, was released in 2018, and a third novel, *OtherLife*, in 2019. Segel created and starred in the American drama television series *Dispatches from Elsewhere*, which premiered on March 1, 2020, on AMC.\n\n\nIn 2019, Segel starred in *Our Friend* based on Matthew Teague's 2015 essay \"The Friend\".[40]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSegel is an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church.[41] He performed a wedding ceremony on *The Tonight Show* on July 6, 2010, for a couple that solicited his services by placing pictures of him around his hometown and the bar he frequently visited.[42]\n\n\nSegel dated his *Freaks and Geeks* co-star Linda Cardellini for several years following the show's cancellation.[43] He dated Michelle Williams from 2012 to 2013.[44] From December 2013 to April 2021, Segel dated photographer Alexis Mixter.[45][46]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Segel, Neil Patrick Harris and Joss Whedon in 2011\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998\n | *Can't Hardly Wait* | Matt\n |  |\n| 1998\n | *Dead Man on Campus* | Kyle\n |  |\n| 1998\n | *SLC Punk!* | Mike\n |  |\n| 2002\n | *Slackers* | Sam Schechter\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *11:14* | Leon (Paramedic #1)\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *Certainly Not a Fairytale* | Leo\n |  |\n| 2004\n | *LolliLove* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2005\n | *The Good Humor Man* | Smelly Bob\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Bye Bye Benjamin* | Theodore Everest\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny* | Frat Boy\n | Deleted scenes\n |\n| 2007\n | *Knocked Up* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *Forgetting Sarah Marshall* | Peter Bretter\n | Also writer |\n| 2009\n | *I Love You, Man* | Sydney Fife\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Despicable Me* | Victor \"Vector\" Perkins (voice)\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Gulliver's Travels* | Horatio\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Bad Teacher* | Russell Gettis\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Friends with Benefits* | Brice\n | Uncredited cameo\n |\n| 2011\n | *Jeff, Who Lives at Home* | Jeff Thompkins\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *The Muppets* | Gary\n | Also writer and executive producer |\n| 2012\n | *The Five-Year Engagement* | Tom Solomon\n | Also writer and executive producer\n |\n| 2012\n | *This Is 40* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *This Is the End* | Himself\n | Uncredited cameo\n |\n| 2014\n | *Sex Tape* | Jay Hargrove\n | Also writer and executive producer\n |\n| 2015\n | *The End of the Tour* | David Foster Wallace |  |\n| 2017\n | *The Discovery* | Will Harbor\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *Come Sunday* | Henry\n |  |\n| 2019\n | *Our Friend*[47] | Dane Faucheux\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *The Sky Is Everywhere*[48] | Big Walker\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *Windfall*[49] | Nobody\n | Also story writer and producer\n |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1999\u20132000\n | *Freaks and Geeks* | Nick Andopolis | Main role;

'Oh no, I have to actually perform. I have to do well, and I have to have a voice... and I have to have thoughts now.'\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2002\u20132016: Early roles and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\n![A brunette woman smiles](image)Smulders at a CBS event in 2008\nSmulders made her professional acting debut in 2002, with guest appearances in the UPN science fiction comedy series *Special Unit 2* and the Showtime science fiction drama series *Jeremiah*.
