For the 11 March 2011 earthquake in the T\u014dhoku region, see 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami.\n\n![](image)Earthquakes M5.5+ around Japan (1900\u20132016)  \nM7.0\u20137.9=163 EQs, M8.0+=14 EQs.[1]\nThis is a **list of earthquakes in Japan** with either a magnitude greater than or equal to 7.0 or which caused significant damage or casualties. As indicated below, magnitude is measured on the Richter magnitude scale (*ML*) or the moment magnitude scale (*Mw*), or the surface wave magnitude scale (*Ms*) for very old earthquakes. The present list is not exhaustive, and furthermore reliable and precise magnitude data is scarce for earthquakes that occurred before the development of modern measuring instruments.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAlthough there is mention of an earthquake in Yamato in what is now Nara Prefecture on August 23, 416, the first earthquake to be reliably documented took place in Nara prefecture on May 28, 599 during the reign of Empress Suiko, destroying buildings throughout Yamato province.[2][3][4] Many historical records of Japanese earthquakes exist. The Imperial Earthquake Investigation Committee was created in 1892 to conduct a systematic collation of the available historical data, published in 1899 as the *Catalogue of Historical Data on Japanese Earthquakes*.[4]\n\n\nFollowing the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake, the Imperial Earthquake Investigation Committee was superseded by the Earthquake Research Institute in 1925.[3] In modern times, the catalogues compiled by Tatsuo Usami are considered to provide the most authoritative source of information on historic earthquakes, with the 2003 edition detailing 486 that took place between 416 and 1888.[3]\n\n\n\n## Earthquake measurement[edit]\n\n\nIn Japan, the *Shindo* scale is commonly used to measure earthquakes by seismic intensity instead of magnitude. This is similar to the Modified Mercalli intensity scale used in the United States or the Liedu scale used in China, meaning that the scale measures the intensity of an earthquake at a given location instead of measuring the energy an earthquake releases at its epicenter (its magnitude) as the Richter scale does.[5]\n\n\nUnlike other seismic intensity scales, which normally have twelve levels of intensity, *shindo* (\u9707\u5ea6, seismic intensity, literally \"degree of shaking\") as used by the Japan Meteorological Agency is a unit with ten levels, ranging from *shindo* zero, a very light tremor, to *shindo* seven, a severe earthquake.[5] Intermediate levels for earthquakes with *shindo* five and six are \"weak\" or \"strong\", according to the degree of destruction they cause. Earthquakes measured at *shindo* four and lower are considered to be weak to mild, while those measured at five and above can cause heavy damage to furniture, wall tiles, wooden houses, reinforced concrete buildings, roads, gas and water pipes.[5]\n\n\n\n## Earthquakes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(May 2015)*\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Date and time\n | Magnitude | Casualties\n | Name\u00a0of\u00a0quake\n | Name in Kanji\u00a0\n | R\u014dmaji\u00a0name\n | Epicenter | Description\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| November 29, 684 (proleptic Gregorian calendar)November 26, 684 (Julian calendar) | 8.4 *MK* (Kawasumi scale)[6] | 101\u20131,000 | 684 Hakuh\u014d earthquake | \u767d\u9cf3\u5357\u6d77\u5730\u9707 | *Hakuhou Nankai jishin* | 32\u00b048\u2032N 134\u00b018\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff32.8\u00b0N 134.3\u00b0E\ufeff / 32.8; 134.3 | Various references estimate the quake's magnitude at 8.0 to 8.4, with damage being \"severe\".

It is uncertain whether there were two separate earthquakes separated by a short time interval or a single event. It is referred to as a tsunami earthquake, in that the size of the tsunami greatly exceeds that expected from the magnitude of the earthquake.[22] |\n| September 27, 1611 | 6.9 *MK* | 3,700+ (Official estimate) | 1611 Aizu earthquake | \u4f1a\u6d25\u5730\u9707 | *Aizu Jishin* | Aizu basin, (Present day of Fukushima Prefecture) | According to official estimated report, more than 3,700 human fatalities.

The apparent 3D volumes of the bubbles are linearly proportional to their respective fatalities.[1]\nThe following is a summary of significant earthquakes during the **21st century**. \nIn terms of fatalities, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was the most destructive event with 227,898 confirmed fatalities, followed by the 2010 Haiti earthquake with about 160,000 fatalities,[2] the 2008 Sichuan earthquake with 87,587 fatalities, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake with 87,351 fatalities, and the 2023 Turkey\u2013Syria earthquakes with at least 59,259 fatalities.\n\n\nThe 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami became the costliest natural disaster, resulting in approximately $360 billion in property damage at the time, followed by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and the 2023 Turkey\u2013Syria earthquakes, which resulted in $150 billion and $109 billion in damage, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n## List of deadliest earthquakes[edit]\n\n\nAnimated Map of all world earthquakes from 2001-2015\n\n\n|

They range from events too weak to be detectable except by sensitive instrumentation, to sudden and violent events lasting many minutes which have caused some of the greatest disasters in human history. Below, earthquakes are listed by period, region or country, year, magnitude, cost, fatalities and number of scientific studies.\n\n\n\n\n## Lists by time period[edit]\n\n\n### By century[edit]\n\n\n* Before 1901\n* 1901\u20132000\n* 2001\u2013present\n\n\n### By decade[edit]\n\n\n* 2001\u20132010\n* 2011\u20132020\n* 2021\u20132030\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\n* 1900\n* 1901\n* 1902\n* 1903\n* 1904\n* 1905\n* 1906\n* 1907\n* 1908\n* 1909\n* 1910\n* 1911\n* 1912\n* 1913\n* 1914\n* 1915\n* 1916\n* 1917\n* 1918\n* 1919\n* 1920\n* 1921\n* 1922\n* 1923\n* 1924\n* 1925\n* 1926\n* 1927\n* 1928\n* 1929\n* 1930\n* 1931\n* 1932\n* 1933\n* 1934\n* 1935\n* 1936\n* 1937\n* 1938\n* 1939\n* 1940\n* 1941\n* 1942\n* 1943\n* 1944\n* 1945\n* 1946\n* 1947\n* 1948\n* 1949\n* 1950\n* 1951\n* 1952\n* 1953\n* 1954\n* 1955\n* 1956\n* 1957\n* 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1967\n* 1968\n* 1969\n* 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n\n## Lists by country[edit]\n\n\n* Afghanistan\n* Albania\n* Algeria\n* Argentina\n\t+ Mendoza Province\n* Armenia\n* Australia\n* Azerbaijan\n* Bangladesh\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Brazil\n* Bulgaria\n* Canada\n* Chile\n* China\n\t+ Sichuan Province\n\t+ Yunnan Province\n* Colombia\n* Costa Rica\n* Croatia\n* Cuba\n* Cyprus\n* DR.

(The timeframe does not include outlying events like the earlier 1498 Mei\u014d earthquake, 1420 Caldera earthquake, 1361 Sh\u014dhei earthquake, 1356 Lisbon earthquake, 869 J\u014dgan earthquake, and 365 Crete earthquake, each estimated to have magnitude \u22658.5.)\n\n\nPrior to the development and deployment of seismographs \u2013 starting around 1900 \u2013 magnitudes can only be estimated, based on historical reports of the extent and severity of damage.[35]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Date\n | Location\n | Event\n | Magnitude\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | May 22, 1960 | ![Chile](image) Valdivia, Chile\n | 1960 Valdivia earthquake | 9.4\u20139.6\n |\n| 2\n | June 11, 1585 | ![United States](image) Pacific Ocean, Aleutian Islands (now Alaska, United States)\n | 1585 Aleutian Islands earthquake | 9.25 (est.)\n |\n| 3\n | July 8, 1730 | ![Spanish Empire](image) Valparaiso, Chile (then part of the Spanish Empire)\n | 1730 Valpara\u00edso earthquake | 9.1\u20139.3 (est.)[36] |\n| 4\n | March 27, 1964 | ![United States](image) Prince William Sound, Alaska, United States\n | 1964 Alaska earthquake | 9.2\n |\n| 5\n | December 26, 2004 | ![Indonesia](image) Sumatra, Indonesia\n | 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake | 9.1\u20139.3\n |\n| 6\n | March 11, 2011 | ![Japan](image) Pacific Ocean, T\u014dhoku region, Japan\n | 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake | 9.1\n |\n| 7\n | October 17, 1737 | ![Russian Empire](image) Kamchatka Peninsula, Russian Empire | 1737 Kamchatka earthquake | 9.0\u20139.3 (est.)\n |\n| 8\n | November 17, 1837 | ![Chile](image) Valdivia, Chile\n | 1837 Valdivia earthquake | 8.8\u20139.5 (est.)[37] |\n| 9\n | December 16, 1575 | ![Spanish Empire](image) Valdivia, Chile (then part of the Spanish Empire)\n | 1575 Valdivia earthquake | 9.0 (est.)\n |\n| 10\n | November 24, 1604 | ![Spanish Empire](image) Arica, Chile (then part of the Spanish Empire)\n | 1604 Arica earthquake | 9.0 (est.)\n |\n| 11\n | October 28, 1707 | ![](image) Pacific Ocean, Shikoku region, Japan\n | 1707 H\u014dei earthquake | 8.7\u20139.3 (est.)

Earthquakes that occurred in remote areas prior to the advent of modern instrumentation in the early to mid 1900s were not well-reported, and exact locations and magnitudes of such events are often unknown. Therefore, the apparent increase in large earthquake frequency over the last few centuries is unlikely to be accurate, with the better interpretation that, had the list been more complete, then a dozen or so per century would be average.\n\n\n\n## Largest earthquakes by country/territory[edit]\n\n\n* This list is a work in progress. Information is likely to be changed.\n* The list refers to current country boundaries rather than those at the date of the earthquake.\n* Please note, multiple countries could have the same earthquake listed, such as the 1906 Ecuador\u2013Colombia earthquake being listed for both Ecuador and Colombia.\n* Unless otherwise noted, magnitudes are reported on the Moment magnitude scale (Mw).\n\n\n\n\n|
