For the 11 March 2011 earthquake in the Tōhoku region, see 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.\n\n![](image)Earthquakes M5.5+ around Japan (1900–2016)  \nM7.0–7.9=163 EQs, M8.0+=14 EQs.[1]\nThis is a **list of earthquakes in Japan** with either a magnitude greater than or equal to 7.0 or which caused significant damage or casualties. As indicated below, magnitude is measured on the Richter magnitude scale (*ML*) or the moment magnitude scale (*Mw*), or the surface wave magnitude scale (*Ms*) for very old earthquakes. The present list is not exhaustive, and furthermore reliable and precise magnitude data is scarce for earthquakes that occurred before the development of modern measuring instruments.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAlthough there is mention of an earthquake in Yamato in what is now Nara Prefecture on August 23, 416, the first earthquake to be reliably documented took place in Nara prefecture on May 28, 599 during the reign of Empress Suiko, destroying buildings throughout Yamato province.[2][3][4] Many historical records of Japanese earthquakes exist. The Imperial Earthquake Investigation Committee was created in 1892 to conduct a systematic collation of the available historical data, published in 1899 as the *Catalogue of Historical Data on Japanese Earthquakes*.[4]\n\n\nFollowing the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, the Imperial Earthquake Investigation Committee was superseded by the Earthquake Research Institute in 1925.[3] In modern times, the catalogues compiled by Tatsuo Usami are considered to provide the most authoritative source of information on historic earthquakes, with the 2003 edition detailing 486 that took place between 416 and 1888.[3]\n\n\n\n## Earthquake measurement[edit]\n\n\nIn Japan, the *Shindo* scale is commonly used to measure earthquakes by seismic intensity instead of magnitude. This is similar to the Modified Mercalli intensity scale used in the United States or the Liedu scale used in China, meaning that the scale measures the intensity of an earthquake at a given location instead of measuring the energy an earthquake releases at its epicenter (its magnitude) as the Richter scale does.[5]\n\n\nUnlike other seismic intensity scales, which normally have twelve levels of intensity, *shindo* (震度, seismic intensity, literally \"degree of shaking\") as used by the Japan Meteorological Agency is a unit with ten levels, ranging from *shindo* zero, a very light tremor, to *shindo* seven, a severe earthquake.[5] Intermediate levels for earthquakes with *shindo* five and six are \"weak\" or \"strong\", according to the degree of destruction they cause. Earthquakes measured at *shindo* four and lower are considered to be weak to mild, while those measured at five and above can cause heavy damage to furniture, wall tiles, wooden houses, reinforced concrete buildings, roads, gas and water pipes.[5]\n\n\n\n## Earthquakes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(May 2015)*\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Date and time\n | Magnitude | Casualties\n | Name of quake\n | Name in Kanji \n | Rōmaji name\n | Epicenter | Description\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| November 29, 684 (proleptic Gregorian calendar)November 26, 684 (Julian calendar) | 8.4 *MK* (Kawasumi scale)[6] | 101–1,000 | 684 Hakuhō earthquake | 白鳳南海地震 | *Hakuhou Nankai jishin* | 32°48′N 134°18′E﻿ / ﻿32.8°N 134.3°E﻿ / 32.8; 134.3 | Various references estimate the quake's magnitude at 8.0 to 8.4, with damage being \"severe\". The dates of the quake have also been listed variously as October 14 (incorrect date) and November 24.[7] It was at this point in time that the Japanese confirmed the link between earthquakes and tsunamis, and began keeping detailed records of them.

It killed 15,000 people altogether, due in large part to a tsunami that was triggered by the collapse of nearby Mount Mayuyama's southern flank into the bay. The incident is also referred to with the phrase 'Shimabara erupted, Higo affected' (島原大変肥後迷惑), as many people in Higo, (Kumamoto, located 20 km (12 mi) away across the Ariake Sea) were also killed by the resulting tsunami, which then bounced back to hit Shimabara again.[31] |\n| December 18, 1828 | 6.9 *MK* | 1,559 (official confirmed) | 1828 Sanjō earthquake | 三条地震 | *Sanjō Jishin* | Sanjo, Niigata Prefecture (then Echigo Province) | According to the official confirmed report, 21,134 houses and buildings were damaged, and 1,204 of them burned down.

Just before the shaking could be felt, a sound like a cannon was reportedly heard intermittently from the direction of the estuary near the Maruyama River. During the earthquake, the ground in the town of Tokyooka experienced strong seismic vibrations for 16 seconds. As most of the buildings of the time were wooden, many of them were destroyed at once during the initial earthquake.

For the 11 March 2011 earthquake in the Tōhoku region, see 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.\n\n![](image)Earthquakes M5.5+ around Japan (1900–2016)  \nM7.0–7.9=163 EQs, M8.0+=14 EQs.[1]\nThis is a **list of earthquakes in Japan** with either a magnitude greater than or equal to 7.0 or which caused significant damage or casualties. As indicated below, magnitude is measured on the Richter magnitude scale (*ML*) or the moment magnitude scale (*Mw*), or the surface wave magnitude scale (*Ms*) for very old earthquakes. The present list is not exhaustive, and furthermore reliable and precise magnitude data is scarce for earthquakes that occurred before the development of modern measuring instruments.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAlthough there is mention of an earthquake in Yamato in what is now Nara Prefecture on August 23, 416, the first earthquake to be reliably documented took place in Nara prefecture on May 28, 599 during the reign of Empress Suiko, destroying buildings throughout Yamato province.[2][3][4] Many historical records of Japanese earthquakes exist. The Imperial Earthquake Investigation Committee was created in 1892 to conduct a systematic collation of the available historical data, published in 1899 as the *Catalogue of Historical Data on Japanese Earthquakes*.[4]\n\n\nFollowing the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, the Imperial Earthquake Investigation Committee was superseded by the Earthquake Research Institute in 1925.[3] In modern times, the catalogues compiled by Tatsuo Usami are considered to provide the most authoritative source of information on historic earthquakes, with the 2003 edition detailing 486 that took place between 416 and 1888.[3]\n\n\n\n## Earthquake measurement[edit]\n\n\nIn Japan, the *Shindo* scale is commonly used to measure earthquakes by seismic intensity instead of magnitude. This is similar to the Modified Mercalli intensity scale used in the United States or the Liedu scale used in China, meaning that the scale measures the intensity of an earthquake at a given location instead of measuring the energy an earthquake releases at its epicenter (its magnitude) as the Richter scale does.[5]\n\n\nUnlike other seismic intensity scales, which normally have twelve levels of intensity, *shindo* (震度, seismic intensity, literally \"degree of shaking\") as used by the Japan Meteorological Agency is a unit with ten levels, ranging from *shindo* zero, a very light tremor, to *shindo* seven, a severe earthquake.[5] Intermediate levels for earthquakes with *shindo* five and six are \"weak\" or \"strong\", according to the degree of destruction they cause. Earthquakes measured at *shindo* four and lower are considered to be weak to mild, while those measured at five and above can cause heavy damage to furniture, wall tiles, wooden houses, reinforced concrete buildings, roads, gas and water pipes.[5]\n\n\n\n## Earthquakes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(May 2015)*\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Date and time\n | Magnitude | Casualties\n | Name of quake\n | Name in Kanji \n | Rōmaji name\n | Epicenter | Description\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| November 29, 684 (proleptic Gregorian calendar)November 26, 684 (Julian calendar) | 8.4 *MK* (Kawasumi scale)[6] | 101–1,000 | 684 Hakuhō earthquake | 白鳳南海地震 | *Hakuhou Nankai jishin* | 32°48′N 134°18′E﻿ / ﻿32.8°N 134.3°E﻿ / 32.8; 134.3 | Various references estimate the quake's magnitude at 8.0 to 8.4, with damage being \"severe\".

The apparent 3D volumes of the bubbles are linearly proportional to their respective fatalities.[1]\nThe following is a summary of significant earthquakes during the **21st century**. \nIn terms of fatalities, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was the most destructive event with 227,898 confirmed fatalities, followed by the 2010 Haiti earthquake with about 160,000 fatalities,[2] the 2008 Sichuan earthquake with 87,587 fatalities, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake with 87,351 fatalities, and the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes with at least 59,259 fatalities.\n\n\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami became the costliest natural disaster, resulting in approximately $360 billion in property damage at the time, followed by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes,

fatalities, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was the most destructive event with 227,898 confirmed fatalities, followed by the 2010 Haiti earthquake with about 160,000 fatalities,[2] the 2008 Sichuan earthquake with 87,587 fatalities, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake with 87,351 fatalities, and the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes with at least 59,259 fatalities.\n\n\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and

Earthquakes that occurred in remote areas prior to the advent of modern instrumentation in the early to mid 1900s were not well-reported, and exact locations and magnitudes of such events are often unknown. Therefore, the apparent increase in large earthquake frequency over the last few centuries is unlikely to be accurate, with the better interpretation that, had the list been more complete, then a dozen or so per century would be average.\n\n\n\n## Largest earthquakes by country/territory[edit]\n\n\n* This list is a work in progress. Information is likely to be changed.\n* The list refers to current country boundaries rather than those at the date of the earthquake.\n* Please note, multiple countries could have the same earthquake listed, such as the 1906 Ecuador–Colombia earthquake being listed for both Ecuador and Colombia.\n* Unless otherwise noted, magnitudes are reported on the Moment magnitude scale (Mw).\n\n\n\n\n|

conflation of this earthquake with earthquakes in November 1137 on the Jazira plain and on September 30, 1139, in the Azerbaijani city of Ganja. The first mention of a 230,000 death toll was by Ibn Taghribirdi in the fifteenth century.[176] |\n| 8\n | 2010 Haiti earthquake | January 12, 2010 | ![Haiti](image) Haiti | 100,000–316,000 (estimates) | 7.0 | Estimates vary from 316,000 (Haitian government) to 222,570 (UN OCHA estimate)[177] to 158,000 (*Medicine, Conflict and Survival*) to between 85,000 and 46,000 (report commissioned by USAID).[178][179] |\n| 9\n | 1303 Hongdong earthquake | July 25, 1303 | Shanxi, Yuan dynasty (modern-day ![China](image) China)\n | 200,000[180] | 8.0\n | Taiyuan and Pingyang were leveled.\n |\n| 10\n | 856 Damghan earthquake | December 22, 856 | Damghan, Abbasid Caliphate (modern-day ![Iran](image) Iran) | 200,000 | 7.9 Ms |  |\n| 11\n | 893 Ardabil earthquake | March 22, 893 | Ardabil, Abbasid Caliphate (modern-day ![Iran](image) Iran) | 150,000 | Unknown | Reports probably relate to the 893 Dvin earthquake, due to misreading of the Arabic word for Dvin, 'Dabil' as 'Ardabil'.[181] This is regarded as a 'fake earthquake'.[182] |\n| 12\n | 533 Aleppo earthquake | November 29, 533 | ![Byzantine Empire](image) Aleppo, Byzantine Empire (modern-day Syria) | 130,000[183] | Unknown\n |\n| 13\n | 1908 Messina earthquake | December 28, 1908 | ![Kingdom of Italy](image) Messina, Italy | 123,000[184] | 7.1 | The ground shook for 30 to 40 seconds around 5:20 am, and destruction occurred within a 300 km radius. 91% of structures in Messina were destroyed and ~70,000 residents died.

They range from events too weak to be detectable except by sensitive instrumentation, to sudden and violent events lasting many minutes which have caused some of the greatest disasters in human history. Below, earthquakes are listed by period, region or country, year, magnitude, cost, fatalities and number of scientific studies.\n\n\n\n\n## Lists by time period[edit]\n\n\n### By century[edit]\n\n\n* Before 1901\n* 1901–2000\n* 2001–present\n\n\n### By decade[edit]\n\n\n* 2001–2010\n* 2011–2020\n* 2021–2030\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\n* 1900\n* 1901\n* 1902\n* 1903\n* 1904\n* 1905\n* 1906\n* 1907\n* 1908\n* 1909\n* 1910\n* 1911\n* 1912\n* 1913\n* 1914\n* 1915\n* 1916\n* 1917\n* 1918\n* 1919\n* 1920\n* 1921\n* 1922\n* 1923\n* 1924\n* 1925\n* 1926\n* 1927\n* 1928\n* 1929\n* 1930\n* 1931\n* 1932\n* 1933\n* 1934\n* 1935\n* 1936\n* 1937\n* 1938\n* 1939\n* 1940\n* 1941\n* 1942\n* 1943\n* 1944\n* 1945\n* 1946\n* 1947\n* 1948\n* 1949\n* 1950\n* 1951\n* 1952\n* 1953\n* 1954\n* 1955\n* 1956\n* 1957\n* 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1967\n* 1968\n* 1969\n* 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n\n## Lists by country[edit]\n\n\n* Afghanistan\n* Albania\n* Algeria\n* Argentina\n\t+ Mendoza Province\n* Armenia\n* Australia\n* Azerbaijan\n* Bangladesh\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Brazil\n* Bulgaria\n* Canada\n* Chile\n* China\n\t+ Sichuan Province\n\t+ Yunnan Province\n* Colombia\n* Costa Rica\n* Croatia\n* Cuba\n* Cyprus\n* DR.

Therefore, the apparent increase in large earthquake frequency over the last few centuries is unlikely to be accurate, with the better interpretation that, had the list been more complete, then a dozen or so per century would be average.\n\n\n\n## Largest earthquakes by country/territory[edit]\n\n\n* This list is a work in progress.

The first mention of a 230,000 death toll was by Ibn Taghribirdi in the fifteenth century.[176] |\n| 8\n | 2010 Haiti earthquake | January 12, 2010 | ![Haiti](image) Haiti | 100,000–316,000 (estimates) | 7.0 | Estimates vary from 316,000 (Haitian government) to 222,570 (UN OCHA estimate)[177] to 158,000 (*Medicine, Conflict and Survival*) to between 85,000 and 46,000 (report commissioned by USAID).[178][179] |\n| 9\n | 1303 Hongdong earthquake | July 25, 1303 | Shanxi, Yuan dynasty (modern-day ![China](image) China)\n | 200,000[180] | 8.0\n | Taiyuan and Pingyang were leveled.\n |\n| 10\n | 856 Damghan earthquake | December 22, 856 | Damghan, Abbasid Caliphate (modern-day ![Iran](image) Iran) | 200,000 | 7.9 Ms |  |\n| 11\n | 893 Ardabil earthquake | March 22, 893 | Ardabil, Abbasid Caliphate (modern-day ![Iran](image) Iran) | 150,000 | Unknown | Reports probably relate to the 893 Dvin earthquake, due to misreading of the Arabic word for Dvin, 'Dabil' as 'Ardabil'.[181] This is regarded as a 'fake earthquake'.[182] |\n| 12\n | 533 Aleppo earthquake | November 29, 533 | ![Byzantine Empire](image) Aleppo, Byzantine Empire (modern-day Syria) | 130,000[183] | Unknown\n |\n| 13\n | 1908 Messina earthquake | December 28, 1908 | ![Kingdom of Italy](image) Messina, Italy | 123,000[184] | 7.1 | The ground shook for 30 to 40 seconds around 5:20 am, and destruction occurred within a 300 km radius. 91% of structures in Messina were destroyed and ~70,000 residents died. Rescuers searched for weeks, and whole families were pulled out alive days later. A 40-foot (12 m) tsunami struck nearby coasts. Reggio Calabria on the Italian mainland also suffered heavy damage.\n |\n| 14\n | 1948 Ashgabat earthquake | October 6, 1948 | ![Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic](image) Ashgabat, Turkmen SSR (modern-day Turkmenistan) | 10,000–110,000 | 7.3 Ms |  |\n| 15\n | 1923 Great Kantō earthquake | September 1, 1923 | ![Empire of Japan](image) Kantō region, Japan | 105,385[185] | 7.9 | This earthquake with an epicenter beneath Izu Ōshima Island in Sagami Bay, shook the Kantō plain on the Japanese island of Honshū at 11:58 am. Shaking duration reported between 4 and 10 minutes, devastating Tokyo, Yokohama, Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka.[186] Shaking slid the 93-ton Great Buddha statue at Kamakura almost 2 feet (0.61 m) forward.
