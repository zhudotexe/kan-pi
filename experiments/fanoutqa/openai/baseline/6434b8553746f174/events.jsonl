According to Tuvalu's constitution, the prime minister must always be a member of the parliament, and is elected by parliament in a secret ballot. Because there are no political parties in Tuvalu, any member of parliament can be nominated for the role. Following the parliamentary vote the governor-general of Tuvalu (as head of state) is responsible for swearing in as the prime minister the person who commands the confidence of a majority of members of parliament.\n\n\nThe office of prime minister was established when Tuvalu gained independence in 1978, although the post is sometimes considered to be a continuation of the earlier office of chief minister, which was created in 1975. If the prime minister dies, as has happened on one occasion, the deputy prime minister becomes acting prime minister until a new one is elected by parliament. The prime minister can lose his office by resigning, being defeated in a motion of no confidence by parliament, or losing his seat in a parliamentary election. \n\n\nSeveral former prime ministers have been appointed the governor-general of Tuvalu.\n\n\nKausea Natano is the incumbent prime minister, since 19 September 2019.\n\n\n\n## List of prime ministers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name(Birth–Death) | Election\n | Term of office\n | Ministry\n | Governor-General\n | Monarch\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office\n | Left office\n | Time in office\n |\n| Chief Minister of the Ellice Islands\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Sir Toaripi Lauti(1928–2014) | —\n | 2 October 1975\n | 1 October 1978\n | 2 years, 364 days\n | Lauti Ministry1st Ministry | John Hillary Smith | **Queen Elizabeth II** |\n| Prime Minister of Tuvalu\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Sir Toaripi Lauti(1928–2014) | 1977 | 1 October 1978\n | 8 September 1981\n | 2 years, 342 days\n | Lauti Ministry1st Ministry | Sir Fiatau Penitala Teo |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Tomasi Puapua(born 1938) | 19811985 | 8 September 1981\n | 16 October 1989\n | 8 years, 38 days\n | First Puapua MinistrySecond Puapua Ministry2nd Ministry |\n| Sir Tupua Leupena |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | Bikenibeu Paeniu(born 1956) | 19891993 (Sep) | 16 October 1989\n | 10 December 1993\n | 4 years, 55 days\n | First Paeniu Ministry3rd Ministry |\n| Sir Toaripi Lauti |\n| Sir Tomu Sione |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | Sir Kamuta Latasi(born 1936) | 1993 (Nov) | 10 December 1993\n | 24 December 1996\n | 3 years, 14 days\n | Latasi Ministry4th Ministry |\n| Sir Tulaga Manuella |\n| (3) | ![](image) | Bikenibeu Paeniu(born 1956) | 1993 (Nov)1998 | 24 December 1996\n | 27 April 1999\n | 2 years, 124 days\n | Second Paeniu MinistryThird Paeniu Ministry5th Ministry |\n| Sir Tomasi Puapua |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | Ionatana Ionatana(1938–2000) | 1998 | 27 April 1999\n | 8 December 2000\n | 1 year, 225 days\n | Ionatana Ministry6th Ministry |\n| Acting1 | ![](image) | Lagitupu Tuilimu | —\n | 8 December 2000\n | 24 February 2001\n | 78 days\n | Tuilimu Ministry6th Ministry (Cont.) |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Faimalaga Luka(1940–2005) | 1998 | 24 February 2001\n | 14 December 2001\n | 293 days\n | Luka Ministry7th Ministry |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | Koloa Talake(1934–2008) | 1998 | 14 December 2001\n | 2 August 2002\n | 231 days\n | Talake Ministry8th Ministry |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Saufatu Sopoanga(1952–2020) | 2002 | 2 August 2002\n | 27 August 2004\n | 2 years, 25 days\n | Sopoanga Ministry9th Ministry |\n| Faimalaga Luka |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | Maatia Toafa(born 1954) | 2002 | 27 August 2004\n | 14 August 2006\n | 1 year, 352 days\n | First Toafa Ministry10th Ministry |\n| Sir Filoimea Telito |\n| 10\n | ![](image) | Apisai Ielemia(1955–2018) | 2006 | 14 August 2006\n | 29 September 2010\n | 4 years, 46 days\n | Ielemia Ministry11th Ministry |\n| *Sir Kamuta Latasi* |\n| Sir Iakoba Italeli |\n| (9) | ![](image) | Maatia Toafa(born 1954) | 2010 | 29 September 2010\n | 24 December 2010\n | 86 days\n | Second Toafa Ministry12th Ministry |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | Willy Telavi(born 1954) | 2010 | 24 December 2010\n | 1 August 2013\n | 2 years, 220 days\n | Telavi Ministry13th Ministry |\n| 12\n | ![](image) | Enele Sopoaga(born 1956) | 20102015 | 1 August 2013\n | 19 September 2019\n | 6 years, 49 days\n | Sopoaga Ministry14th Ministry |\n| *Mrs. Teniku Talesi Honolulu*,*Samuelu Teo*,Sir Tofiga Vaevalu Falani |\n| 13\n | ![](image) | Kausea Natano(born 1957) | 2019 | 19 September 2019\n | Incumbent\n | 4 years, 268 days\n | Natano Ministry15th Ministry | **King Charles III** |\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\n\n1. **^** Tuilimu served as acting prime minister following the death of Ionatana.[2][3]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Governor-General of Tuvalu\n* Politics of Tuvalu\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tuvalu. \"PRESCRIPTION OF SALARIES ACT, 2008 Revised Edition\" (PDF). *tuvalu-legislation.tv*.\n2. **^** \"Tuvalu: Year In Review 2001\". *Britannica*. 2001.

The prime minister can lose his office by resigning, being defeated in a motion of no confidence by parliament, or losing his seat in a parliamentary election. \n\n\nSeveral former prime ministers have been appointed the governor-general of Tuvalu.\n\n\nKausea Natano is the incumbent prime minister, since 19 September 2019.\n\n\n\n## List of prime ministers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name(Birth–Death) | Election\n | Term of office\n | Ministry\n | Governor-General\n | Monarch\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office\n | Left office\n | Time in office\n |\n| Chief Minister of the Ellice Islands\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Sir Toaripi Lauti(1928–2014) | —\n | 2 October 1975\n | 1 October 1978\n | 2 years, 364 days\n | Lauti Ministry1st Ministry | John Hillary Smith | **Queen Elizabeth II** |\n| Prime Minister of Tuvalu\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | Sir Toaripi Lauti(1928–2014) | 1977 | 1 October 1978\n | 8 September 1981\n | 2 years, 342 days\n | Lauti Ministry1st Ministry | Sir Fiatau Penitala Teo |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | Tomasi Puapua(born 1938) | 19811985 | 8 September 1981\n | 16 October 1989\n | 8 years, 38 days\n | First Puapua MinistrySecond Puapua Ministry2nd Ministry |\n| Sir Tupua Leupena |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | Bikenibeu Paeniu(born 1956) | 19891993 (Sep) | 16 October 1989\n | 10 December 1993\n | 4 years, 55 days\n | First Paeniu Ministry3rd Ministry |\n| Sir Toaripi Lauti |\n| Sir Tomu Sione |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | Sir Kamuta Latasi(born 1936) | 1993 (Nov) | 10 December 1993\n | 24 December 1996\n | 3 years, 14 days\n | Latasi Ministry4th Ministry |\n| Sir Tulaga Manuella |\n| (3) | ![](image) | Bikenibeu Paeniu(born 1956) | 1993 (Nov)1998 | 24 December 1996\n | 27 April 1999\n | 2 years, 124 days\n | Second Paeniu MinistryThird Paeniu Ministry5th Ministry |\n| Sir Tomasi Puapua |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | Ionatana Ionatana(1938–2000) | 1998 | 27 April 1999\n | 8 December 2000\n | 1 year, 225 days\n | Ionatana Ministry6th Ministry |\n| Acting1 | ![](image) | Lagitupu Tuilimu | —\n | 8 December 2000\n | 24 February 2001\n | 78 days\n | Tuilimu Ministry6th Ministry (Cont.) |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | Faimalaga Luka(1940–2005) | 1998 | 24 February 2001\n | 14 December 2001\n | 293 days\n | Luka Ministry7th Ministry |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | Koloa Talake(1934–2008) | 1998 | 14 December 2001\n | 2 August 2002\n | 231 days\n | Talake Ministry8th Ministry |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | Saufatu Sopoanga(1952–2020) | 2002 | 2 August 2002\n | 27 August 2004\n | 2 years, 25 days\n | Sopoanga Ministry9th Ministry |\n| Faimalaga Luka |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | Maatia Toafa(born 1954) | 2002 | 27 August 2004\n | 14 August 2006\n | 1 year, 352 days\n | First Toafa Ministry10th Ministry |\n| Sir Filoimea Telito |\n| 10\n | ![](image) | Apisai Ielemia(1955–2018) | 2006 | 14 August 2006\n | 29 September 2010\n | 4 years, 46 days\n | Ielemia Ministry11th Ministry |\n| *Sir Kamuta Latasi* |\n| Sir Iakoba Italeli |\n| (9) | ![](image) | Maatia Toafa(born 1954) | 2010 | 29 September 2010\n | 24 December 2010\n | 86 days\n | Second Toafa Ministry12th Ministry |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | Willy Telavi(born 1954) | 2010 | 24 December 2010\n | 1 August 2013\n | 2 years, 220 days\n | Telavi Ministry13th Ministry |\n| 12\n | ![](image) | Enele Sopoaga(born 1956) | 20102015 | 1 August 2013\n | 19 September 2019\n | 6 years, 49 days\n | Sopoaga Ministry14th Ministry |\n| *Mrs. Teniku Talesi Honolulu*,*Samuelu Teo*,Sir Tofiga Vaevalu Falani |\n| 13\n | ![](image) | Kausea Natano(born 1957) | 2019 | 19 September 2019\n | Incumbent\n | 4 years, 268 days\n | Natano Ministry15th Ministry | **King Charles III** |\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\n\n1. **^** Tuilimu served as acting prime minister following the death of Ionatana.[2][3]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Governor-General of Tuvalu\n* Politics of Tuvalu\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tuvalu. \"PRESCRIPTION OF SALARIES ACT, 2008 Revised Edition\" (PDF). *tuvalu-legislation.tv*.\n2. **^** \"Tuvalu: Year In Review 2001\". *Britannica*. 2001.

After the Avignon Papacy (1309–1377) the popes have mainly resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere. The Vatican is also a metonym for the Holy See.\n\n\nThe Holy See dates back to early Christianity and is the principal episcopal see of the Catholic Church, which has approximately 1.329 billion baptised Catholics in the world as of 2018[update] in the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic Churches.[23] The independent state of Vatican City, on the other hand, came into existence on 11 February 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy, which spoke of it as a new creation,[24] not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756–1870), which had previously encompassed much of Central Italy.\n\n\nVatican City contains religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Apostolic Library, and the Vatican Museums. They feature some of the world's most famous paintings and sculptures. The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by donations from the faithful, by the sale of postage stamps and souvenirs, fees for admission to museums, and sales of publications. Vatican City has no taxes and items are duty-free.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name *Vatican City* was first used in the Lateran Treaty, signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city-state named after Vatican Hill, the geographic location of the state within the city of Rome. \"Vatican\" is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement, *Vatica* or *Vaticum*, located in the general area the Romans called *Ager Vaticanus*, \"Vatican territory\".[25]\n\n\nThe Italian name of the city is *Città del Vaticano* or, more formally, *Stato della Città del Vaticano*, meaning 'Vatican City State'. Its Latin name is **Status Civitatis Vaticanae**;[26][27] this is used in official documents by the Holy See, the Church and the Pope.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the Papacy and Holy See § History\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Vatican Obelisk in St. Peter's Square was brought to Rome from Egypt by Caligula\nThe name \"Vatican\" was already in use in the time of the Roman Republic for the *Ager Vaticanus*, a marshy area on the west bank of the Tiber across from the city of Rome, located between the Janiculum, the Vatican Hill and Monte Mario, down to the Aventine Hill and up to the confluence of the Cremera creek.[28] The toponym *Ager Vaticanus* is attested until the 1st century AD: afterwards, another toponym appeared, *Vaticanus*, denoting an area much more restricted: the Vatican Hill, today's St. Peter's Square, and possibly today's Via della Conciliazione.[28] Because of its vicinity to Rome's archenemy, the Etruscan city of Veii (another naming for the *Ager Vaticanus* was *Ripa Veientana* or *Ripa Etrusca*), and for being subjected to the floods of the Tiber, the Romans considered this originally uninhabited part of Rome dismal and ominous.[29]\n\n\nThe particularly low quality of Vatican wine, even after the reclamation of the area, was commented on by the poet Martial (40 – between AD 102 and 104).[30] Tacitus wrote that in AD 69, the Year of the Four Emperors, when the northern army that brought Vitellius to power arrived in Rome, \"a large proportion camped in the unhealthy districts of the Vatican, which resulted in many deaths among the common soldiery; and the Tiber being close by, the inability of the Gauls and Germans to bear the heat and the consequent greed with which they drank from the stream weakened their bodies, which were already an easy prey to disease\".[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)An early interpretation of the relative locations of the circus, and the medieval and current Basilicas of St. Peter\n![](image)One possible modern interpretation[32]\nDuring the Roman Empire, many villas were constructed there, after Agrippina the Elder (14 BC–18 October AD 33) drained the area and laid out her gardens in the early 1st century AD. In AD 40, her son, Emperor Caligula (31 August AD 12–24 January AD 41; r. 37–41) built in her gardens a circus for charioteers (AD 40) that was later completed by Nero, the *Circus Gaii et Neronis*,[33] usually called, simply, the Circus of Nero.[34]\n\n\nThe Vatican Obelisk in St. Peter's Square is the last visible remnant from the Circus of Nero. It was brought from Heliopolis in Egypt by Emperor Caligula. The obelisk originally stood at the centre of the *spina* (median) of the Roman circus.[35] The circus became the site of martyrdom for many Christians after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64. Tradition states that it was in this circus that Saint Peter was crucified upside-down.[36] In 1586, the obelisk was relocated to its current position by Pope Sixtus V using a method devised by Italian architect Domenico Fontana.[37]\n\n\nOpposite the circus was a cemetery separated by the Via Cornelia. Funeral monuments and mausoleums, and small tombs, as well as altars to pagan gods of all kinds of polytheistic religions, were constructed lasting until before the construction of the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter in the first half of the 4th century. A shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess Cybele and her consort Attis remained active long after the ancient Basilica of St. Peter was built nearby.[38]\nRemains of this ancient necropolis were brought to light sporadically during renovations by various popes throughout the centuries, increasing in frequency during the Renaissance until it was systematically excavated by orders of Pope Pius XII from 1939 to 1941. The Constantinian basilica was built in 326 over what was believed to be the tomb of Saint Peter, buried in that cemetery.[39]\n\n\nFrom then on, the area became more populated in connection with activity at the basilica. A palace was constructed nearby as early as the 5th century during the pontificate of Pope Symmachus (reigned 498–514).[40]\n\n\n\n### Papal States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Papal States\n\nSee also: History of the Papacy\n\n![](image)The Italian peninsula in 1796. The Papal States in central Italy are coloured purple.\nPopes gradually came to have a secular role as governors of regions near Rome. They ruled the Papal States, which covered a large portion of the Italian peninsula, for more than a thousand years until the mid-19th century, when all the territory belonging to the papacy was seized by the newly created Kingdom of Italy.\n\n\nFor most of this time, the popes did not live at the Vatican. The Lateran Palace, on the opposite side of Rome, was their habitual residence for about a thousand years. From 1309 to 1377, they lived at Avignon in France. On their return to Rome, they chose to live at the Vatican. They moved to the Quirinal Palace in 1583, after work on it was completed under Pope Paul V (1605–1621), but on the capture of Rome in 1870 retired to the Vatican, and what had been their residence became that of the King of Italy.\n\n\n\n### Under Italian rule (1871–1929)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman Question\n\nIn 1870, the Pope's holdings were left in an uncertain situation when Rome itself was annexed by Italian forces, thus bringing to completion the Italian unification, after a nominal resistance by the papal forces. Between 1861 and 1929 the status of the Pope was referred to as the \"Roman Question\".\n\n\nItaly made no attempt to interfere with the Holy See within the Vatican walls. However, it confiscated church property in many places. In 1871, the Quirinal Palace was confiscated by the King of Italy and became the royal palace. Thereafter, the popes resided undisturbed within the Vatican walls, and certain papal prerogatives were recognised by the Law of Guarantees, including the right to send and receive ambassadors. But the Popes did not recognise the Italian king's right to rule in Rome, and they refused to leave the Vatican compound until the dispute was resolved in 1929; Pope Pius IX (1846–1878), the last ruler of the Papal States, was referred to as a \"prisoner in the Vatican\". Forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues.[41]\n\n\n\n### Lateran treaties[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lateran Treaty\n\nThis situation was resolved on 11 February 1929, when the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy was signed by Prime Minister and Head of Government Benito Mussolini on behalf of King Victor Emmanuel III and by Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri for Pope Pius XI.[24][20][42] The treaty, which became effective on 7 June 1929, established the independent state of Vatican City and reaffirmed the special status of Catholic Christianity in Italy.[43]\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vatican City in World War II\n\n![](image)Bands of the British army's 38th Brigade playing in front of St Peter's Basilica, June 1944\nThe Holy See, which ruled Vatican City, pursued a policy of neutrality during World War II, under the leadership of Pope Pius XII. Although German troops occupied the city of Rome after the September 1943 Armistice of Cassibile, and the Allies from 1944, they respected Vatican City as neutral territory.[44] One of the main diplomatic priorities of the bishop of Rome was to prevent the bombing of the city; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British air dropping of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality.[45] The British policy, as expressed in the minutes of a Cabinet meeting, was: \"that we should on no account molest the Vatican City, but that our action as regards the rest of Rome would depend upon how far the Italian government observed the rules of war\".[45]\n\n\nAfter the US entered into the war, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, but said that \"they could not stop the British from bombing Rome if the British so decided\". The US military even exempted Catholic pilots and crew from air raids on Rome and other Church holdings, unless voluntarily agreed upon. Notably, with the exception of Rome, and presumably the possibility of the Vatican, no Catholic US pilot or air crew refused a mission within German-held Italy. The British uncompromisingly said \"they would bomb Rome whenever the needs of the war demanded\".[46] In December 1942, the UK's envoy suggested to the Holy See that Rome be declared an \"open city\", a suggestion that the Holy See took more seriously than was probably meant by the UK, who did not want Rome to be an open city, but Mussolini rejected the suggestion when the Holy See put it to him. In connection with the Allied invasion of Sicily, 500 US aircraft bombed Rome on 19 July 1943, aiming particularly at the railway hub. Some 1,500 people were killed. Pius XII, who had been described in the previous month as \"worried sick\" about the possible bombing, viewed the aftermath. Another raid took place on 13 August 1943, after Mussolini had been ousted from power.[47] On the following day, the new government declared Rome an open city, after consulting the Holy See on the wording of the declaration, but the UK had decided that they would never recognise Rome as an open city.[48]\n\n\n\n### Post-war history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of St. Peter's Square from the top of Michelangelo's dome\nPius XII had refrained from creating cardinals during the war. By the end of World War II, there were several prominent vacancies: Cardinal Secretary of State, Camerlengo, Chancellor, and Prefect for the Congregation for the Religious among them.[49] Pius XII created 32 cardinals in early 1946, having announced his intention to do so in his preceding Christmas message.\n\n\nThe Pontifical Military Corps, except for the Swiss Guard, was disbanded by the will of Paul VI, as expressed in a letter of 14 September 1970.[50] The Gendarmerie Corps was transformed into a civilian police and security force.\n\n\nIn 1984, a new concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain provisions of the earlier treaty, including the position of Catholic Christianity as the Italian state religion, a position given to it by a statute of the Kingdom of Sardinia of 1848.[43]\n\n\nConstruction in 1995 of a new guest house, Domus Sanctae Marthae, adjacent to St Peter's Basilica was criticised by Italian environmental groups, backed by Italian politicians. They claimed the new building would block views of the Basilica from nearby Italian apartments.[51] For a short while the plans strained the relations between the Vatican and the Italian government. The head of the Vatican's Department of Technical Services robustly rejected challenges to the Vatican State's right to build within its borders.[51]\n\n\nJohn R. Morss writes in the *European Journal of International Law* that due to the terms of the Lateran Treaty, Vatican City's status as a sovereign state, and the Pope's status as a head of state, are problematic.[*clarification needed*][52]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

It is in this territory that St. Peter's Basilica, the Apostolic Palace, the Sistine Chapel, and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman *rione* of Borgo until 1929. Being separated from the city, on the west bank of the river Tiber, the area was an outcrop of the city that was protected by being included within the walls of Leo IV (847–855), and later expanded by the current fortification walls, built under Paul III (1534–1549), Pius IV (1559–1565), and Urban VIII (1623–1644).[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)Territory of Vatican City State according to the Lateran Treaty\nWhen the Lateran Treaty of 1929 that gave the state its form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.[54]\n\n\nThe territory includes St. Peter's Square, distinguished from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the Via della Conciliazione which runs from close to the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by Benito Mussolini after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.\n\n\nAccording to the Lateran Treaty, certain properties of the Holy See that are located in Italian territory, most notably the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo and the major basilicas, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign embassies.[55][56] These properties, scattered all over Rome and Italy, house essential offices and institutions necessary to the character and mission of the Holy See.[56]\n\n\nCastel Gandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by police agents of Vatican City State and not by Italian police. According to the Lateran Treaty (Art. 3) St. Peter's Square, up to but not including the steps leading to the basilica, is normally patrolled by the Italian police.[55]\n\n\nThere are no passport controls for visitors entering Vatican City from the surrounding Italian territory. There is free public access to Saint Peter's Square and Basilica and, on the occasion of papal general audiences, to the hall in which they are held. For these audiences and for major ceremonies in Saint Peter's Basilica and Square, tickets free of charge must be obtained beforehand. The Vatican Museums, incorporating the Sistine Chapel, usually charge an entrance fee. There is no general public access to the gardens, but guided tours for small groups can be arranged to the gardens and excavations under the basilica. Other places are open to only those individuals who have business to transact there.[57]\n\n\n\n![St. Peter's Square, the basilica and obelisk, from Piazza Pio XII](image)\nSt. Peter's Square, the basilica and obelisk, from Piazza Pio XII\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nVatican City's climate is the same as Rome's: a temperate, Mediterranean climate *Csa* with mild, rainy winters from October to mid-May and hot, dry summers from May to September. Some minor local features, principally mists and dews, are caused by the anomalous bulk of St Peter's Basilica, the elevation, the fountains, and the size of the large paved square. The highest temperature ever recorded was 40.7 °C (105.3 °F), on both 2 August 2017 and 27 June 2022.[58]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Vatican City *(data of Aeroporto Roma-Ciampino \"Giovan Battista Pastine\")* |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 37.8(100.0)\n | 39.4(102.9)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n | 38.4(101.1)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 30.3(86.5)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 8.2(46.8)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 24.1(75.4)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 3.1(37.6)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n | 11.3(52.3)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n | −4.4(24.1)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 0.8(33.4)\n | −5.2(22.6)\n | −4.8(23.4)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 67(2.6)\n | 73(2.9)\n | 58(2.3)\n | 81(3.2)\n | 53(2.1)\n | 34(1.3)\n | 19(0.7)\n | 37(1.5)\n | 73(2.9)\n | 113(4.4)\n | 115(4.5)\n | 81(3.2)\n | 804(31.7)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1 mm) | 7.0\n | 7.6\n | 7.6\n | 9.2\n | 6.2\n | 4.3\n | 2.1\n | 3.3\n | 6.2\n | 8.2\n | 9.7\n | 8.0\n | 79.4\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 120.9\n | 132.8\n | 167.4\n | 201.0\n | 263.5\n | 285.0\n | 331.7\n | 297.6\n | 237.0\n | 195.3\n | 129.0\n | 111.6\n | 2,472.8\n |\n| Source: https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/noaa-earth-had-its-third-warmest-year-record-2017 |\n\nIn July 2007, the Vatican accepted a proposal by two firms based respectively in San Francisco and Budapest,[61] whereby it would become the first carbon neutral state by offsetting its carbon dioxide emissions with the creation of a Vatican Climate Forest in Hungary,[62] as a purely symbolic gesture[63] to encourage Catholics to do more to safeguard the planet.[64] Nothing came of the project.[65][66]\n\n\nOn 26 November 2008, the Vatican itself put into effect a plan announced in May 2007 to cover the roof of the Paul VI Audience Hall with solar panels.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### Gardens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gardens of Vatican City\n\nWithin the territory of Vatican City are the Vatican Gardens (Italian: *Giardini Vaticani*),[69] which account for about half of this territory. The gardens, established during the Renaissance and Baroque era, are decorated with fountains and sculptures.\n\n\nThe gardens cover approximately 23 hectares (57 acres). The highest point is 60 metres (197 ft) above mean sea level. Stone walls bound the area in the north, south, and west.\n\n\nThe gardens date back to medieval times when orchards and vineyards extended to the north of the Papal Apostolic Palace.[70] In 1279, Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, 1277–1280) moved his residence back to the Vatican from the Lateran Palace and enclosed this area with walls.[71] He planted an orchard *(pomerium)*, a lawn *(pratellum)*, and a garden *(viridarium)*.[71]\n\n\n\n![A panorama of gardens and several buildings viewed from St. Peter's Basilica](image)\nPanorama of the gardens viewed from St. Peter's Basilica\n\n## Governance[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Vatican City\n\nThe politics of Vatican City takes place in the context of an absolute elective monarchy, in which the head of the Catholic Church holds power. The Pope exercises principal legislative, executive, and judicial power over the State of Vatican City (an entity distinct from the Holy See), which is a rare case of a non-hereditary monarchy.\n\n\n\n### State and Holy See[edit]\n\n\nVatican City State, created in 1929 by the Lateran Pacts, provides the Holy See with a temporal jurisdiction and independence within a small territory. It is distinct from the Holy See. The state can thus be deemed a significant but not essential instrument of the Holy See. The Holy See itself has existed continuously as a juridical entity since Roman Imperial times and has been internationally recognised as a powerful and independent sovereign entity since Late Antiquity to the present, without interruption even at times when it was deprived of territory (e.g. 1870 to 1929).\n\n\nVatican City is one of the few widely recognised independent states that has not become a member of the United Nations.[72] The Holy See, which is distinct from Vatican City State, has permanent observer status, with all the rights of a full member except for a vote in the UN General Assembly.\n\n\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pope Francis in Vatican City, 2021\nThe government of Vatican City has a unique structure. The Pope is the sovereign of the state, while legislative authority is vested in the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, a body of cardinals appointed by the Pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the president of that commission, assisted by the general secretary and deputy general secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's Secretariat of State and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the Pope has absolute power in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches over Vatican City,[73]\nand is thus the only absolute monarch in Europe.[74]\n\n\nOperationally, there are departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications and other matters.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Sede vacante[edit]\n\n\nThe Cardinal Camerlengo presides over the Apostolic Camera, to which is entrusted the administration of the property and protection of other papal temporal powers and rights of the Holy See during the period of the empty throne or sede vacante (papal vacancy).[75] Those of the Vatican State remain under the control of the Pontifical Commission for the State of Vatican City. Acting with three other cardinals chosen by lot every three days, one from each order of cardinals (cardinal bishop, cardinal priest, and cardinal deacon), he in a sense performs during that period the functions of head of state of Vatican City.[76] All the decisions these four cardinals take must be approved by the College of Cardinals as a whole.\n\n\n\n#### Papal nobility[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Papal nobility\n\nThe nobility that was closely associated with the Holy See at the time of the Papal States continued to be associated with the Papal Court after the loss of these territories, generally with merely nominal duties (see Papal Master of the Horse, Prefecture of the Pontifical Household, Hereditary officers of the Roman Curia, Black Nobility). They also formed the ceremonial Noble Guard. In the first decades of the existence of the Vatican City State, executive functions were entrusted to some of them, including that of delegate for the State of Vatican City (now denominated president of the Commission for Vatican City). But with the motu proprio *Pontificalis Domus* of 28 March 1968,[77] Pope Paul VI abolished the honorary positions that had continued to exist until then, such as Quartermaster general and Master of the Horse.[78]\n\n\n\n### Head of state and government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pope and President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State\n\nSee also: List of Sovereigns of the Vatican City State\n\n![](image)The Apostolic Palace (*Palazzo Apostolico*), the official residence of the Pope. Here, Benedict XVI is at the window marked by a maroon banner hanging from the windowsill at centre.\nThe Pope is *ex officio* head of state[79] of Vatican City, a function dependent on his primordial function as bishop of the diocese of Rome and head of the Catholic Church.[80] The term \"Holy See\" refers not to the Vatican state but to the Pope's spiritual and pastoral governance, largely exercised through the Roman Curia.[81] His official title with regard to Vatican City is *Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City*.\n\n\nPope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was elected on 13 March 2013. His principal subordinate government official for Vatican City as well as the country's head of government is the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, who since 1952 exercises the functions previously belonging to the Governor of Vatican City. Since 2001, the president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State also has the title of president of the Governorate of the State of Vatican City. The president is Spanish Cardinal Fernando Vérgez Alzaga, who was appointed on 1 October 2021.\n\n\n\n### Administration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Vatican City\n\n![](image)Palace of the Governorate of Vatican City State\nLegislative functions are delegated to the unicameral Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, led by the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State. Its seven members are cardinals appointed by the Pope for terms of five years. Acts of the commission must be approved by the Pope, through the Holy See's Secretariat of State, and before taking effect must be published in a special appendix of the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*. Most of the content of this appendix consists of routine executive decrees, such as approval for a new set of postage stamps.\n\n\nExecutive authority is delegated to the Governorate of Vatican City. The Governorate consists of the President of the Pontifical Commission—using the title \"President of the Governorate of Vatican City\"—a general secretary, and a Vice general secretary, each appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. Important actions of the Governorate must be confirmed by the Pontifical Commission and by the Pope through the Secretariat of State.\n\n\nThe Governorate oversees the central governmental functions through several departments and offices. The directors and officials of these offices are appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. These organs concentrate on material questions concerning the state's territory, including local security, records, transportation, and finances. The Governorate oversees a modern security and police corps, the *Corpo della Gendarmeria dello Stato della Città del Vaticano*.\n\n\nJudicial functions are delegated to a supreme court, an appellate court, a tribunal (Tribunal of Vatican City State), and a trial judge. At the Vatican's request, sentences imposed can be served in Italy (see the section on crime, below).\n\n\nThe international postal country code prefix is *SCV*, and the only postal code is *00120* – altogether *SCV-00120*.[82]\n\n\n\n### Defence and security[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Military in Vatican City, Pontifical Swiss Guard, Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City, and Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State\n\n![](image)A guard of the Vatican at his sentry box\nAs Vatican City is an enclave within Italy, its military defence is provided by the Italian Armed Forces. However, there is no formal defence treaty with Italy, as Vatican City is a neutral state. Vatican City has no armed forces of its own, although the Swiss Guard is a military corps of the Holy See responsible for the personal security of the Pope, and residents in the state. Soldiers of the Swiss Guard are entitled to hold Vatican City State passports and nationality. Swiss mercenaries were historically recruited by Popes as part of an army for the Papal States, and the Pontifical Swiss Guard was founded by Pope Julius II on 22 January 1506 as the Pope's personal bodyguard and continues to fulfill that function. It is listed in the *Annuario Pontificio* under \"Holy See\", not under \"State of Vatican City\". At the end of 2005, the Guard had 134 members. Recruitment is arranged by a special agreement between the Holy See and Switzerland. All recruits must be Catholic, unmarried males with Swiss citizenship who have completed their basic training with the Swiss Armed Forces with certificates of good conduct, be between the ages of 19 and 30, and be at least 174 cm (5 ft 9 in) in height. Members are equipped with small arms and the traditional halberd (also called the Swiss voulge), and trained in bodyguarding tactics. The Palatine Guard and the Noble Guard, the last armed forces of the Vatican City State, were disbanded by Pope Paul VI in 1970.[50] As Vatican City has listed every building in its territory on the International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection, the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict theoretically renders it immune to armed attack.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gendarmerie car\nCivil defence is the responsibility of the Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State, the national fire brigade. Dating its origins to the early nineteenth century, the Corps in its present form was established in 1941. It is responsible for fire fighting, as well as a range of civil defence scenarios including flood, natural disaster, and mass casualty management. The Corps is governmentally supervised through the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence, which is also responsible for the Gendarmerie (see below).\n\n\nThe Gendarmerie Corps (*Corpo della Gendarmeria*) is the gendarmerie, or police and security force, of Vatican City and the extraterritorial properties of the Holy See.[84] The corps is responsible for security, public order, border control, traffic control, criminal investigation, and other general police duties in Vatican City including providing security for the Pope outside of Vatican City. The corps has 130 personnel and is a part of the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence (which also includes the Vatican Fire Brigade), an organ of the Governorate of Vatican City.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### Crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The crowds of tourists in St. Peter's Square are a target for pickpockets.\nCrime in Vatican City consists largely of purse snatching, pickpocketing and shoplifting by outsiders.[87] The tourist foot-traffic in St. Peter's Square is one of the main locations for pickpockets in Vatican City.[88] If crimes are committed in Saint Peter's Square, the perpetrators may be arrested and tried by the Italian authorities, since that area is normally patrolled by Italian police.[89]\n\n\nUnder the terms of article 22 of the Lateran Treaty,[90] Italy will, at the request of the Holy See, punish individuals for crimes committed within Vatican City and will itself proceed against the person who committed the offence, if that person takes refuge in Italian territory. Persons accused of crimes recognised as such both in Italy and in Vatican City that are committed in Italian territory will be handed over to the Italian authorities if they take refuge in Vatican City or in buildings that enjoy immunity under the treaty.[90][91]\n\n\nVatican City has no prison system, apart from a few detention cells for pre-trial detention.[92] People convicted of committing crimes in the Vatican serve terms in Italian prisons (Polizia Penitenziaria), with costs covered by the Vatican.[93]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of the Holy See and List of diplomatic missions of the Holy See\n\n![](image)The *Ingresso di Sant'Anna*, an entrance to Vatican City from Italy\nVatican City State is a recognised national territory under international law, but it is the Holy See that conducts diplomatic relations on its behalf, in addition to the Holy See's own diplomacy, entering into international agreements in its regard. Vatican City thus has no diplomatic service of its own.\n\n\nBecause of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies. Foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the city of Rome; only during the Second World War were the staff of some embassies accredited to the Holy See given what hospitality was possible within the narrow confines of Vatican City—embassies such as that of the United Kingdom while Rome was held by the Axis Powers and Germany's when the Allies controlled Rome.\n\n\nThe size of Vatican City is thus unrelated to the large global reach exercised by the Holy See as an entity quite distinct from the state.[94]\n\n\nHowever, Vatican City State itself participates in some international organizations whose functions relate to the state as a geographical entity, distinct from the non-territorial legal persona of the Holy See. These organizations are much less numerous than those in which the Holy See participates either as a member or with observer status. They include the following eight, in each of which Vatican City State holds membership:[95][96]\n\n\n\n* European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT)\n* European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Eutelsat IGO)\n* International Grains Council (IGC)\n* International Institute of Administrative Sciences (IIAS)\n* International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\n* International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (ITSO)\n* Interpol[97]\n* Universal Postal Union (UPU)\n\n\nIt also participates in:[95]\n\n\n\n* World Medical Association\n* World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)\n\n\n### Non-party, non-signatory policy[edit]\n\n\nThe Vatican City is not a member of the United Nations (UN), but was granted observer status to the United Nations General Assembly in 1968; the only other country in a similar position is the partially recognised State of Palestine. Since it is not a member of the UN, the Vatican City is not subjected to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It does, however, engage with various UN specialised agencies through its observer status including the Central Emergency Response Fund, to which it contributed US$20,000 between 2006 and 2022.[98]\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is not a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC). In Europe, only Belarus is also a non-party, non-signatory state, while Ukraine and Monaco are signatory states that have not ratified and Russia withdrew from it in 2016.\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is not a member of the European Court of Human Rights. Among European states, Belarus is also not a member, while Russia has ceased to be part of it after being expelled from the Council of Europe following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\nThe OECD's \"Common Reporting Standard\" (CRS), aiming at preventing tax evasion and money laundering, has also not been signed.[99][100][101] The Vatican City State has been criticised for money laundering practises in the past decades.[102][103][104] The only other country in Europe that has not agreed to sign the CRS is Belarus.\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is also one of few countries in the world that does not provide any publicly available financial data to the International Monetary Fund.[105]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Vatican City\n\nThe Vatican City State budget includes the Vatican Museums and post office and is supported financially by the sale of stamps, coins, medals and tourist mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publications sales.[j] The incomes and living standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome.[106] Other industries include printing, the production of mosaics, and the manufacture of staff uniforms. There is a Vatican Pharmacy.\n\n\n\n![](image)Vatican Museums' \"New Wing\", built by Raffaele Stern (1774–1820)\nThe Institute for Works of Religion (IOR, *Istituto per le Opere di Religione*), also known as the Vatican Bank, is a financial agency situated in the Vatican that conducts worldwide financial activities. It has multilingual ATMs with instructions in Latin, possibly the only ATM in the world with this feature.[107]\n\n\nVatican City issues its own coins and stamps. It has used the euro as its currency since 1 January 1999, owing to a special agreement with the European Union (council decision 1999/98/EC). Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1 January 2002—the Vatican does not issue euro banknotes. Issuance of euro-denominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than usual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy.[108] Because of their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.[109] Until the adoption of the Euro, Vatican coinage and stamps were denominated in their own Vatican lira currency, which was on par with the Italian lira.\n\n\nVatican City State, which employs nearly 2,000 people, had a surplus of 6.7 million euros in 2007 but ran a deficit in 2008 of over 15 million euros.[110]\n\n\nIn 2012, the US Department of State's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report listed Vatican City for the first time among the nations of concern for money-laundering, placing it in the middle category, which includes countries such as Ireland, but not among the most vulnerable countries, which include the United States itself, Germany, Italy, and Russia.[111]\n\n\nOn 24 February 2014, the Vatican announced it was establishing a secretariat for the economy, to be responsible for all economic, financial, and administrative activities of the Holy See and the Vatican City State, headed by Cardinal George Pell. This followed the charging of two senior clerics including a monsignor with money laundering offences. Pope Francis also appointed an auditor-general authorised to carry out random audits of any agency at any time and engaged a US financial services company to review the Vatican's 19,000 accounts to ensure compliance with international money laundering practices. The pontiff also ordered that the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See would be the Vatican's central bank, with responsibilities similar to other central banks around the world.[112]\n\n\nIn 2022, the Vatican planned to release NFTs of its museum collection.[113]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Women in Vatican City\n\nAs of 2023, Vatican City had a population of 764 residents, regardless of citizenship.[13] There were also 372 Vatican citizens residing elsewhere,[13] consisting of diplomats of the Holy See to other countries and cardinals residing in Rome.[114]\n\n\nThe population is composed of clergy, other religious members, laypeople serving the state (such as the Swiss Guard) and their family members.[115] In 2013 there were 13 families of the employees of the Holy See living in Vatican City,[116] in 2019 there were 20 children of the Swiss Guards living at the Vatican.[117] All citizens, residents and places of worship in the city are Catholic. The city also receives thousands of tourists and workers every day.\n\n\n\nVatican City population on 26 June 2023[13]\n| Sex | all\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Citizenship | Vatican | other\n |\n| Residency | other | Vatican City\n |\n| Pope |  | 1 |  |\n| Cardinals | 55 | 9 |  |\n| Diplomats | 317 |  |  |\n| Swiss Guard |  | 104 |  |\n| Others |  | 132 | 518\n |\n| Total | 618 | 518\n |\n| 372 | 246\n |\n| 764\n |\n| 1,136\n |\n\nVatican City population on 1 March 2011[115]\n| Sex | all | male | female\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Citizenship | Vatican | other | Vatican | other | Vatican | other\n |\n| Residency | other | Vatican City | other | Vatican City | other | Vatican City\n |\n| Pope |  | 1 |  |  | 1 |  |  |  |  |\n| Cardinals | 43 | 30 |  | 43 | 30 |  |  |  |  |\n| Diplomats | 306 |  |  | 306 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Swiss Guard |  | 86 |  |  | 86 |  |  |  |  |\n| Other religious |  | 50 | 197 |  | 49 | 102 |  | 1 | 95\n |\n| Other lay |  | 56 | 24 |  | 25 | 3 |  | 31 | 21\n |\n| Total | 572 | 221 | 540 | 105 | 32 | 116\n |\n| 349 | 223 | 349 | 191 |  | 32\n |\n| 444 | 296 | 148\n |\n| 793 | 645 | 148\n |\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Languages of Vatican City\n\n![](image)The Seal of Vatican City. Note the use of the Italian language.\nVatican City has no formally enacted official language, but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses Latin for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.[118] Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, Italian or Romansh. The official websites of the Holy See[119] and of Vatican City[120] are primarily in Italian, with versions of their pages in a large number of languages to varying extents.\n\n\n\n### Citizenship[edit]\n\n\nUnlike citizenship of other states, which is based either on *jus sanguinis* (birth from a citizen, even outside the state's territory) or on *jus soli* (birth within the territory of the state), citizenship of Vatican City is granted on *jus officii*, namely on the grounds of appointment to work in a certain capacity in the service of the Holy See. It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is also extended to the spouse and children of a citizen, provided they are living together in the city.[114] Some individuals are also authorized to reside in the city but do not qualify or choose not to request citizenship.[114] Anyone who loses Vatican citizenship and does not possess other citizenship automatically becomes an Italian citizen as provided in the Lateran Treaty.[55]\n\n\nThe Holy See, not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City issues normal passports for its citizens.\n\n\n\n### Statistical oddities[edit]\n\n\nIn statistics comparing countries in various per capita or per area metrics, Vatican City is often an outlier—these can stem from the state's small size and ecclesiastical function.[121] For example, as most of the roles which would confer citizenship are reserved for men, the gender ratio of the citizenship is several men per woman.[122] Further oddities are petty crimes against tourists resulting in a very high per-capita crime rate,[123] and the city-state leading the world in per-capita wine consumption due to its sacramental use.[121] A jocular illustration of these anomalies is sometimes made by calculating a \"Popes per km2\" statistic, which is greater than two because the country is less than half a square kilometre in area.[124]\n\n\n\n![360-degree view from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, looking over the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square (centre) and out into Rome, showing Vatican City in all directions](image)\n360-degree view from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, looking over the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square (centre) and out into Rome, showing Vatican City in all directions\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Vatican City\n\nSee also: Music of Vatican City and Sport in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The Vatican Museums (*Musei Vaticani*) display works from the extensive collection of the Catholic Church.\nVatican City is home to some of the most famous art in the world. St. Peter's Basilica, whose successive architects include Bramante, Michelangelo, Giacomo della Porta, Maderno and Bernini, is a renowned work of Renaissance architecture. The Sistine Chapel is famous for its frescos, which include works by Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Botticelli as well as the ceiling and Last Judgment by Michelangelo. Artists who decorated the interiors of the Vatican include Raphael and Fra Angelico.\n\n\nThe Vatican Apostolic Library and the collections of the Vatican Museums are of the highest historical, scientific and cultural importance.[125] In 1984, the Vatican was added by UNESCO to the List of World Heritage Sites; it is the only one to consist of an entire state.[126] Furthermore, it is the only site to date registered with the UNESCO as a *centre containing monuments* in the \"International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection\" according to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.[126]\n\n\nFootball in Vatican City is organized by the Vatican Amateur Sports Association, which holds the national championship, called the Vatican City Championship, with eight teams, including, for example, the Swiss Guard's FC Guardia and police and museum guard teams.[127] The association also organizes the Coppa Sergio Valci and the Vatican Supercoppa. It controls the Vatican City national football team, which is neither affiliated with UEFA or FIFA.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The shortest national railway system in the world\nVatican City has a reasonably well-developed transport network considering its size (consisting mostly of a piazza and walkways). As a state that is 1.05 kilometres (1,150 yards) long and 0.85 km (930 yd) wide,[128] it has a small transportation system with no airports or highways. The only aviation facility in Vatican City is the Vatican City Heliport. Vatican City is one of the few independent countries without an airport, and is served by the airports that serve the city of Rome, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport and to a lesser extent Ciampino Airport.[129]\n\n\nThere is a standard gauge railway, mainly used to transport freight, connected to Italy's network at Rome's Saint Peter's station by an 852-metre-long (932 yd) spur, 300 metres (330 yd) of which is within Vatican territory.[129] Pope John XXIII was the first Pope to make use of the railway; Pope John Paul II rarely used it.[129]\n\n\nThe closest metro station is Ottaviano – San Pietro – Musei Vaticani.[130]\n\n\n\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Vatican's post office was established on 11 February 1929.\nThe City is served by an independent, modern telephone system named the Vatican Telephone Service,[131] and a postal system (Poste Vaticane) that started operating on 13 February 1929. On 1 August, the state started to release its own postal stamps, under the authority of the Philatelic and Numismatic Office of the Vatican City State.[132] The city's postal service is sometimes said to be \"the best in the world\",[133] and faster than the postal service in Rome.[133]\n\n\nThe Vatican also controls its own Internet top-level domain, which is registered as (.va). Broadband service is widely provided within Vatican City. Vatican City has also been given a radio ITU prefix, HV, and this is sometimes used by amateur radio operators.\n\n\nVatican Radio, which was organised by Guglielmo Marconi, broadcasts on short-wave, medium-wave and FM frequencies and on the Internet.[134] Its main transmission antennae are located in Italian territory, and exceed Italian environmental protection levels of emission. For this reason, the Vatican Radio has been sued. Television services are provided through another entity, the Vatican Television Center.[135]\n\n\n*L'Osservatore Romano* is the multilingual semi-official newspaper of the Holy See. It is published by a private corporation under the direction of Catholic laymen, but reports on official information. However, the official texts of documents are in the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*, the official gazette of the Holy See, which has an appendix for documents of the Vatican City State.\n\n\nVatican Radio, the Vatican Television Center, and L'Osservatore Romano are organs not of the Vatican State but of the Holy See, and are listed as such in the *Annuario Pontificio*, which places them in the section \"Institutions linked with the Holy See\", ahead of the sections on the Holy See's diplomatic service abroad and the diplomatic corps accredited to the Holy See, after which is placed the section on the State of Vatican City.\n\n\n\n### Recycling[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the Vatican began an \"ecological island\" for renewable waste and has continued the initiative throughout the papacy of Francis. These innovations included, for example, the installation of a solar power system on the roof of the Paul VI Audience Hall. In July 2019, it was announced that Vatican City would ban the use and sale of single-use plastics as soon as its supply was depleted, well before the 2021 deadline established by the European Union. It is estimated that 50–55% of Vatican City's municipal solid waste is properly sorted and recycled, with the goal of reaching the EU standard of 70–75%.[136]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Vatican City portal\n* ![flag](image)Italy portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Architecture of Vatican City\n* Holy city\n* Index of Vatican City-related articles\n* Law of Vatican City\n* News.va\n* Outline of Vatican City\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Many other languages are used by institutions situated within the state, such as the Holy See, the Pontifical Swiss Guard, and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  \nThe Holy See uses Latin as its main official language, Italian as its main working language and French as its main diplomatic language; in addition, its Secretariat of State uses English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. The Swiss Guard, in which commands on parade are given in German, also uses French and Italian, two of the three other official Swiss languages, in its official ceremonies, such as the annual swearing in of the new recruits on 6 May.[3]\n2. **^** All powers delegated by the sovereign[9][10]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The De Agostini Atlas Calendar listed the area of Vatican City as 44 ha in its 1930 edition[11] but corrected it to 49 ha in its 1945–1946 edition.[12] The figure of 44 ha is still widely cited by many sources despite its inaccuracy.\n4. **^** Visitors and tourists are not permitted to drive inside Vatican City without specific permission, which is normally granted only to those on official business in Vatican City.\n5. **^** ITU-T assigned code 379 to Vatican City.

Moreover, an annual collection taken up in dioceses and direct donations go to a non-budgetary fund known as Peter's Pence, which is used directly by the Pope for charity, disaster relief and aid to churches in developing nations.\n\n### Citation notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Reuters Staff (6 October 2014). \"Pope ditches Latin as official language of Vatican synod\". *Reuters*.\n2. **^** \"What language is spoken at the Vatican?\". *Visiting The Vatican*. 13 April 2023.

After the Avignon Papacy (1309–1377) the popes have mainly resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere. The Vatican is also a metonym for the Holy See.\n\n\nThe Holy See dates back to early Christianity and is the principal episcopal see of the Catholic Church, which has approximately 1.329 billion baptised Catholics in the world as of 2018[update] in the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic Churches.[23] The independent state of Vatican City, on the other hand, came into existence on 11 February 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy, which spoke of it as a new creation,[24] not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756–1870), which had previously encompassed much of Central Italy.\n\n\nVatican City contains religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Apostolic Library, and the Vatican Museums. They feature some of the world's most famous paintings and sculptures. The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by donations from the faithful, by the sale of postage stamps and souvenirs, fees for admission to museums, and sales of publications. Vatican City has no taxes and items are duty-free.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name *Vatican City* was first used in the Lateran Treaty, signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city-state named after Vatican Hill, the geographic location of the state within the city of Rome. \"Vatican\" is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement, *Vatica* or *Vaticum*, located in the general area the Romans called *Ager Vaticanus*, \"Vatican territory\".[25]\n\n\nThe Italian name of the city is *Città del Vaticano* or, more formally, *Stato della Città del Vaticano*, meaning 'Vatican City State'. Its Latin name is **Status Civitatis Vaticanae**;[26][27] this is used in official documents by the Holy See, the Church and the Pope.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the Papacy and Holy See § History\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Vatican Obelisk in St. Peter's Square was brought to Rome from Egypt by Caligula\nThe name \"Vatican\" was already in use in the time of the Roman Republic for the *Ager Vaticanus*, a marshy area on the west bank of the Tiber across from the city of Rome, located between the Janiculum, the Vatican Hill and Monte Mario, down to the Aventine Hill and up to the confluence of the Cremera creek.[28] The toponym *Ager Vaticanus* is attested until the 1st century AD: afterwards, another toponym appeared, *Vaticanus*, denoting an area much more restricted: the Vatican Hill, today's St. Peter's Square, and possibly today's Via della Conciliazione.[28] Because of its vicinity to Rome's archenemy, the Etruscan city of Veii (another naming for the *Ager Vaticanus* was *Ripa Veientana* or *Ripa Etrusca*), and for being subjected to the floods of the Tiber, the Romans considered this originally uninhabited part of Rome dismal and ominous.[29]\n\n\nThe particularly low quality of Vatican wine, even after the reclamation of the area, was commented on by the poet Martial (40 – between AD 102 and 104).[30] Tacitus wrote that in AD 69, the Year of the Four Emperors, when the northern army that brought Vitellius to power arrived in Rome, \"a large proportion camped in the unhealthy districts of the Vatican, which resulted in many deaths among the common soldiery; and the Tiber being close by, the inability of the Gauls and Germans to bear the heat and the consequent greed with which they drank from the stream weakened their bodies, which were already an easy prey to disease\".[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)An early interpretation of the relative locations of the circus, and the medieval and current Basilicas of St. Peter\n![](image)One possible modern interpretation[32]\nDuring the Roman Empire, many villas were constructed there, after Agrippina the Elder (14 BC–18 October AD 33) drained the area and laid out her gardens in the early 1st century AD. In AD 40, her son, Emperor Caligula (31 August AD 12–24 January AD 41; r. 37–41) built in her gardens a circus for charioteers (AD 40) that was later completed by Nero, the *Circus Gaii et Neronis*,[33] usually called, simply, the Circus of Nero.[34]\n\n\nThe Vatican Obelisk in St. Peter's Square is the last visible remnant from the Circus of Nero. It was brought from Heliopolis in Egypt by Emperor Caligula. The obelisk originally stood at the centre of the *spina* (median) of the Roman circus.[35] The circus became the site of martyrdom for many Christians after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64. Tradition states that it was in this circus that Saint Peter was crucified upside-down.[36] In 1586, the obelisk was relocated to its current position by Pope Sixtus V using a method devised by Italian architect Domenico Fontana.[37]\n\n\nOpposite the circus was a cemetery separated by the Via Cornelia. Funeral monuments and mausoleums, and small tombs, as well as altars to pagan gods of all kinds of polytheistic religions, were constructed lasting until before the construction of the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter in the first half of the 4th century. A shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess Cybele and her consort Attis remained active long after the ancient Basilica of St. Peter was built nearby.[38]\nRemains of this ancient necropolis were brought to light sporadically during renovations by various popes throughout the centuries, increasing in frequency during the Renaissance until it was systematically excavated by orders of Pope Pius XII from 1939 to 1941. The Constantinian basilica was built in 326 over what was believed to be the tomb of Saint Peter, buried in that cemetery.[39]\n\n\nFrom then on, the area became more populated in connection with activity at the basilica. A palace was constructed nearby as early as the 5th century during the pontificate of Pope Symmachus (reigned 498–514).[40]\n\n\n\n### Papal States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Papal States\n\nSee also: History of the Papacy\n\n![](image)The Italian peninsula in 1796. The Papal States in central Italy are coloured purple.\nPopes gradually came to have a secular role as governors of regions near Rome. They ruled the Papal States, which covered a large portion of the Italian peninsula, for more than a thousand years until the mid-19th century, when all the territory belonging to the papacy was seized by the newly created Kingdom of Italy.\n\n\nFor most of this time, the popes did not live at the Vatican. The Lateran Palace, on the opposite side of Rome, was their habitual residence for about a thousand years. From 1309 to 1377, they lived at Avignon in France. On their return to Rome, they chose to live at the Vatican. They moved to the Quirinal Palace in 1583, after work on it was completed under Pope Paul V (1605–1621), but on the capture of Rome in 1870 retired to the Vatican, and what had been their residence became that of the King of Italy.\n\n\n\n### Under Italian rule (1871–1929)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman Question\n\nIn 1870, the Pope's holdings were left in an uncertain situation when Rome itself was annexed by Italian forces, thus bringing to completion the Italian unification, after a nominal resistance by the papal forces. Between 1861 and 1929 the status of the Pope was referred to as the \"Roman Question\".\n\n\nItaly made no attempt to interfere with the Holy See within the Vatican walls. However, it confiscated church property in many places. In 1871, the Quirinal Palace was confiscated by the King of Italy and became the royal palace. Thereafter, the popes resided undisturbed within the Vatican walls, and certain papal prerogatives were recognised by the Law of Guarantees, including the right to send and receive ambassadors. But the Popes did not recognise the Italian king's right to rule in Rome, and they refused to leave the Vatican compound until the dispute was resolved in 1929; Pope Pius IX (1846–1878), the last ruler of the Papal States, was referred to as a \"prisoner in the Vatican\". Forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues.[41]\n\n\n\n### Lateran treaties[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lateran Treaty\n\nThis situation was resolved on 11 February 1929, when the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy was signed by Prime Minister and Head of Government Benito Mussolini on behalf of King Victor Emmanuel III and by Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri for Pope Pius XI.[24][20][42] The treaty, which became effective on 7 June 1929, established the independent state of Vatican City and reaffirmed the special status of Catholic Christianity in Italy.[43]\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vatican City in World War II\n\n![](image)Bands of the British army's 38th Brigade playing in front of St Peter's Basilica, June 1944\nThe Holy See, which ruled Vatican City, pursued a policy of neutrality during World War II, under the leadership of Pope Pius XII. Although German troops occupied the city of Rome after the September 1943 Armistice of Cassibile, and the Allies from 1944, they respected Vatican City as neutral territory.[44] One of the main diplomatic priorities of the bishop of Rome was to prevent the bombing of the city; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British air dropping of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality.[45] The British policy, as expressed in the minutes of a Cabinet meeting, was: \"that we should on no account molest the Vatican City, but that our action as regards the rest of Rome would depend upon how far the Italian government observed the rules of war\".[45]\n\n\nAfter the US entered into the war, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, but said that \"they could not stop the British from bombing Rome if the British so decided\". The US military even exempted Catholic pilots and crew from air raids on Rome and other Church holdings, unless voluntarily agreed upon. Notably, with the exception of Rome, and presumably the possibility of the Vatican, no Catholic US pilot or air crew refused a mission within German-held Italy. The British uncompromisingly said \"they would bomb Rome whenever the needs of the war demanded\".[46] In December 1942, the UK's envoy suggested to the Holy See that Rome be declared an \"open city\", a suggestion that the Holy See took more seriously than was probably meant by the UK, who did not want Rome to be an open city, but Mussolini rejected the suggestion when the Holy See put it to him. In connection with the Allied invasion of Sicily, 500 US aircraft bombed Rome on 19 July 1943, aiming particularly at the railway hub. Some 1,500 people were killed. Pius XII, who had been described in the previous month as \"worried sick\" about the possible bombing, viewed the aftermath. Another raid took place on 13 August 1943, after Mussolini had been ousted from power.[47] On the following day, the new government declared Rome an open city, after consulting the Holy See on the wording of the declaration, but the UK had decided that they would never recognise Rome as an open city.[48]\n\n\n\n### Post-war history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of St. Peter's Square from the top of Michelangelo's dome\nPius XII had refrained from creating cardinals during the war. By the end of World War II, there were several prominent vacancies: Cardinal Secretary of State, Camerlengo, Chancellor, and Prefect for the Congregation for the Religious among them.[49] Pius XII created 32 cardinals in early 1946, having announced his intention to do so in his preceding Christmas message.\n\n\nThe Pontifical Military Corps, except for the Swiss Guard, was disbanded by the will of Paul VI, as expressed in a letter of 14 September 1970.[50] The Gendarmerie Corps was transformed into a civilian police and security force.\n\n\nIn 1984, a new concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain provisions of the earlier treaty, including the position of Catholic Christianity as the Italian state religion, a position given to it by a statute of the Kingdom of Sardinia of 1848.[43]\n\n\nConstruction in 1995 of a new guest house, Domus Sanctae Marthae, adjacent to St Peter's Basilica was criticised by Italian environmental groups, backed by Italian politicians. They claimed the new building would block views of the Basilica from nearby Italian apartments.[51] For a short while the plans strained the relations between the Vatican and the Italian government. The head of the Vatican's Department of Technical Services robustly rejected challenges to the Vatican State's right to build within its borders.[51]\n\n\nJohn R. Morss writes in the *European Journal of International Law* that due to the terms of the Lateran Treaty, Vatican City's status as a sovereign state, and the Pope's status as a head of state, are problematic.[*clarification needed*][52]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

It is in this territory that St. Peter's Basilica, the Apostolic Palace, the Sistine Chapel, and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman *rione* of Borgo until 1929. Being separated from the city, on the west bank of the river Tiber, the area was an outcrop of the city that was protected by being included within the walls of Leo IV (847–855), and later expanded by the current fortification walls, built under Paul III (1534–1549), Pius IV (1559–1565), and Urban VIII (1623–1644).[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)Territory of Vatican City State according to the Lateran Treaty\nWhen the Lateran Treaty of 1929 that gave the state its form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.[54]\n\n\nThe territory includes St. Peter's Square, distinguished from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the Via della Conciliazione which runs from close to the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by Benito Mussolini after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.\n\n\nAccording to the Lateran Treaty, certain properties of the Holy See that are located in Italian territory, most notably the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo and the major basilicas, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign embassies.[55][56] These properties, scattered all over Rome and Italy, house essential offices and institutions necessary to the character and mission of the Holy See.[56]\n\n\nCastel Gandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by police agents of Vatican City State and not by Italian police. According to the Lateran Treaty (Art. 3) St. Peter's Square, up to but not including the steps leading to the basilica, is normally patrolled by the Italian police.[55]\n\n\nThere are no passport controls for visitors entering Vatican City from the surrounding Italian territory. There is free public access to Saint Peter's Square and Basilica and, on the occasion of papal general audiences, to the hall in which they are held. For these audiences and for major ceremonies in Saint Peter's Basilica and Square, tickets free of charge must be obtained beforehand. The Vatican Museums, incorporating the Sistine Chapel, usually charge an entrance fee. There is no general public access to the gardens, but guided tours for small groups can be arranged to the gardens and excavations under the basilica.

Some minor local features, principally mists and dews, are caused by the anomalous bulk of St Peter's Basilica, the elevation, the fountains, and the size of the large paved square. The highest temperature ever recorded was 40.7 °C (105.3 °F), on both 2 August 2017 and 27 June 2022.[58]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Vatican City *(data of Aeroporto Roma-Ciampino \"Giovan Battista Pastine\")* |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 37.8(100.0)\n | 39.4(102.9)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n | 38.4(101.1)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 30.3(86.5)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 8.2(46.8)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 24.1(75.4)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 3.1(37.6)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n | 11.3(52.3)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n | −4.4(24.1)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 0.8(33.4)\n | −5.2(22.6)\n | −4.8(23.4)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 67(2.6)\n | 73(2.9)\n | 58(2.3)\n | 81(3.2)\n | 53(2.1)\n | 34(1.3)\n | 19(0.7)\n | 37(1.5)\n | 73(2.9)\n | 113(4.4)\n | 115(4.5)\n | 81(3.2)\n | 804(31.7)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1 mm) | 7.0\n | 7.6\n | 7.6\n | 9.2\n | 6.2\n | 4.3\n | 2.1\n | 3.3\n | 6.2\n | 8.2\n | 9.7\n | 8.0\n | 79.4\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 120.9\n | 132.8\n | 167.4\n | 201.0\n | 263.5\n | 285.0\n | 331.7\n | 297.6\n | 237.0\n | 195.3\n | 129.0\n | 111.6\n | 2,472.8\n |\n| Source: https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/noaa-earth-had-its-third-warmest-year-record-2017 |\n\nIn July 2007, the Vatican accepted a proposal by two firms based respectively in San Francisco and Budapest,[61] whereby it would become the first carbon neutral state by offsetting its carbon dioxide emissions with the creation of a Vatican Climate Forest in Hungary,[62] as a purely symbolic gesture[63] to encourage Catholics to do more to safeguard the planet.[64] Nothing came of the project.[65][66]\n\n\nOn 26 November 2008, the Vatican itself put into effect a plan announced in May 2007 to cover the roof of the Paul VI Audience Hall with solar panels.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### Gardens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gardens of Vatican City\n\nWithin the territory of Vatican City are the Vatican Gardens (Italian: *Giardini Vaticani*),[69] which account for about half of this territory. The gardens, established during the Renaissance and Baroque era, are decorated with fountains and sculptures.\n\n\nThe gardens cover approximately 23 hectares (57 acres). The highest point is 60 metres (197 ft) above mean sea level. Stone walls bound the area in the north, south, and west.\n\n\nThe gardens date back to medieval times when orchards and vineyards extended to the north of the Papal Apostolic Palace.[70] In 1279, Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, 1277–1280) moved his residence back to the Vatican from the Lateran Palace and enclosed this area with walls.[71] He planted an orchard *(pomerium)*, a lawn *(pratellum)*, and a garden *(viridarium)*.[71]\n\n\n\n![A panorama of gardens and several buildings viewed from St. Peter's Basilica](image)\nPanorama of the gardens viewed from St. Peter's Basilica\n\n## Governance[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Vatican City\n\nThe politics of Vatican City takes place in the context of an absolute elective monarchy, in which the head of the Catholic Church holds power. The Pope exercises principal legislative, executive, and judicial power over the State of Vatican City (an entity distinct from the Holy See), which is a rare case of a non-hereditary monarchy.\n\n\n\n### State and Holy See[edit]\n\n\nVatican City State, created in 1929 by the Lateran Pacts, provides the Holy See with a temporal jurisdiction and independence within a small territory. It is distinct from the Holy See. The state can thus be deemed a significant but not essential instrument of the Holy See. The Holy See itself has existed continuously as a juridical entity since Roman Imperial times and has been internationally recognised as a powerful and independent sovereign entity since Late Antiquity to the present, without interruption even at times when it was deprived of territory (e.g. 1870 to 1929).\n\n\nVatican City is one of the few widely recognised independent states that has not become a member of the United Nations.[72] The Holy See, which is distinct from Vatican City State, has permanent observer status, with all the rights of a full member except for a vote in the UN General Assembly.\n\n\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pope Francis in Vatican City, 2021\nThe government of Vatican City has a unique structure. The Pope is the sovereign of the state, while legislative authority is vested in the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, a body of cardinals appointed by the Pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the president of that commission, assisted by the general secretary and deputy general secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's Secretariat of State and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the Pope has absolute power in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches over Vatican City,[73]\nand is thus the only absolute monarch in Europe.[74]\n\n\nOperationally, there are departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications and other matters.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Sede vacante[edit]\n\n\nThe Cardinal Camerlengo presides over the Apostolic Camera, to which is entrusted the administration of the property and protection of other papal temporal powers and rights of the Holy See during the period of the empty throne or sede vacante (papal vacancy).[75] Those of the Vatican State remain under the control of the Pontifical Commission for the State of Vatican City. Acting with three other cardinals chosen by lot every three days, one from each order of cardinals (cardinal bishop, cardinal priest, and cardinal deacon), he in a sense performs during that period the functions of head of state of Vatican City.[76] All the decisions these four cardinals take must be approved by the College of Cardinals as a whole.\n\n\n\n#### Papal nobility[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Papal nobility\n\nThe nobility that was closely associated with the Holy See at the time of the Papal States continued to be associated with the Papal Court after the loss of these territories, generally with merely nominal duties (see Papal Master of the Horse, Prefecture of the Pontifical Household, Hereditary officers of the Roman Curia, Black Nobility). They also formed the ceremonial Noble Guard. In the first decades of the existence of the Vatican City State, executive functions were entrusted to some of them, including that of delegate for the State of Vatican City (now denominated president of the Commission for Vatican City). But with the motu proprio *Pontificalis Domus* of 28 March 1968,[77] Pope Paul VI abolished the honorary positions that had continued to exist until then, such as Quartermaster general and Master of the Horse.[78]\n\n\n\n### Head of state and government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pope and President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State\n\nSee also: List of Sovereigns of the Vatican City State\n\n![](image)The Apostolic Palace (*Palazzo Apostolico*), the official residence of the Pope. Here, Benedict XVI is at the window marked by a maroon banner hanging from the windowsill at centre.\nThe Pope is *ex officio* head of state[79] of Vatican City, a function dependent on his primordial function as bishop of the diocese of Rome and head of the Catholic Church.[80] The term \"Holy See\" refers not to the Vatican state but to the Pope's spiritual and pastoral governance, largely exercised through the Roman Curia.[81] His official title with regard to Vatican City is *Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City*.\n\n\nPope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was elected on 13 March 2013. His principal subordinate government official for Vatican City as well as the country's head of government is the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, who since 1952 exercises the functions previously belonging to the Governor of Vatican City. Since 2001, the president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State also has the title of president of the Governorate of the State of Vatican City. The president is Spanish Cardinal Fernando Vérgez Alzaga, who was appointed on 1 October 2021.\n\n\n\n### Administration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Vatican City\n\n![](image)Palace of the Governorate of Vatican City State\nLegislative functions are delegated to the unicameral Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, led by the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State. Its seven members are cardinals appointed by the Pope for terms of five years. Acts of the commission must be approved by the Pope, through the Holy See's Secretariat of State, and before taking effect must be published in a special appendix of the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*. Most of the content of this appendix consists of routine executive decrees, such as approval for a new set of postage stamps.\n\n\nExecutive authority is delegated to the Governorate of Vatican City. The Governorate consists of the President of the Pontifical Commission—using the title \"President of the Governorate of Vatican City\"—a general secretary, and a Vice general secretary, each appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. Important actions of the Governorate must be confirmed by the Pontifical Commission and by the Pope through the Secretariat of State.\n\n\nThe Governorate oversees the central governmental functions through several departments and offices. The directors and officials of these offices are appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. These organs concentrate on material questions concerning the state's territory, including local security, records, transportation, and finances. The Governorate oversees a modern security and police corps, the *Corpo della Gendarmeria dello Stato della Città del Vaticano*.\n\n\nJudicial functions are delegated to a supreme court, an appellate court, a tribunal (Tribunal of Vatican City State), and a trial judge. At the Vatican's request, sentences imposed can be served in Italy (see the section on crime, below).\n\n\nThe international postal country code prefix is *SCV*, and the only postal code is *00120* – altogether *SCV-00120*.[82]\n\n\n\n### Defence and security[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Military in Vatican City, Pontifical Swiss Guard, Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City, and Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State\n\n![](image)A guard of the Vatican at his sentry box\nAs Vatican City is an enclave within Italy, its military defence is provided by the Italian Armed Forces. However, there is no formal defence treaty with Italy, as Vatican City is a neutral state. Vatican City has no armed forces of its own, although the Swiss Guard is a military corps of the Holy See responsible for the personal security of the Pope, and residents in the state. Soldiers of the Swiss Guard are entitled to hold Vatican City State passports and nationality. Swiss mercenaries were historically recruited by Popes as part of an army for the Papal States, and the Pontifical Swiss Guard was founded by Pope Julius II on 22 January 1506 as the Pope's personal bodyguard and continues to fulfill that function. It is listed in the *Annuario Pontificio* under \"Holy See\", not under \"State of Vatican City\". At the end of 2005, the Guard had 134 members. Recruitment is arranged by a special agreement between the Holy See and Switzerland. All recruits must be Catholic, unmarried males with Swiss citizenship who have completed their basic training with the Swiss Armed Forces with certificates of good conduct, be between the ages of 19 and 30, and be at least 174 cm (5 ft 9 in) in height. Members are equipped with small arms and the traditional halberd (also called the Swiss voulge), and trained in bodyguarding tactics. The Palatine Guard and the Noble Guard, the last armed forces of the Vatican City State, were disbanded by Pope Paul VI in 1970.[50] As Vatican City has listed every building in its territory on the International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection, the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict theoretically renders it immune to armed attack.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gendarmerie car\nCivil defence is the responsibility of the Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State, the national fire brigade. Dating its origins to the early nineteenth century, the Corps in its present form was established in 1941. It is responsible for fire fighting, as well as a range of civil defence scenarios including flood, natural disaster, and mass casualty management. The Corps is governmentally supervised through the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence, which is also responsible for the Gendarmerie (see below).\n\n\nThe Gendarmerie Corps (*Corpo della Gendarmeria*) is the gendarmerie, or police and security force, of Vatican City and the extraterritorial properties of the Holy See.[84] The corps is responsible for security, public order, border control, traffic control, criminal investigation, and other general police duties in Vatican City including providing security for the Pope outside of Vatican City. The corps has 130 personnel and is a part of the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence (which also includes the Vatican Fire Brigade), an organ of the Governorate of Vatican City.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### Crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The crowds of tourists in St. Peter's Square are a target for pickpockets.\nCrime in Vatican City consists largely of purse snatching, pickpocketing and shoplifting by outsiders.[87] The tourist foot-traffic in St. Peter's Square is one of the main locations for pickpockets in Vatican City.[88] If crimes are committed in Saint Peter's Square, the perpetrators may be arrested and tried by the Italian authorities, since that area is normally patrolled by Italian police.[89]\n\n\nUnder the terms of article 22 of the Lateran Treaty,[90] Italy will, at the request of the Holy See, punish individuals for crimes committed within Vatican City and will itself proceed against the person who committed the offence, if that person takes refuge in Italian territory. Persons accused of crimes recognised as such both in Italy and in Vatican City that are committed in Italian territory will be handed over to the Italian authorities if they take refuge in Vatican City or in buildings that enjoy immunity under the treaty.[90][91]\n\n\nVatican City has no prison system, apart from a few detention cells for pre-trial detention.[92] People convicted of committing crimes in the Vatican serve terms in Italian prisons (Polizia Penitenziaria), with costs covered by the Vatican.[93]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of the Holy See and List of diplomatic missions of the Holy See\n\n![](image)The *Ingresso di Sant'Anna*, an entrance to Vatican City from Italy\nVatican City State is a recognised national territory under international law, but it is the Holy See that conducts diplomatic relations on its behalf, in addition to the Holy See's own diplomacy, entering into international agreements in its regard. Vatican City thus has no diplomatic service of its own.\n\n\nBecause of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies. Foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the city of Rome; only during the Second World War were the staff of some embassies accredited to the Holy See given what hospitality was possible within the narrow confines of Vatican City—embassies such as that of the United Kingdom while Rome was held by the Axis Powers and Germany's when the Allies controlled Rome.\n\n\nThe size of Vatican City is thus unrelated to the large global reach exercised by the Holy See as an entity quite distinct from the state.[94]\n\n\nHowever, Vatican City State itself participates in some international organizations whose functions relate to the state as a geographical entity, distinct from the non-territorial legal persona of the Holy See. These organizations are much less numerous than those in which the Holy See participates either as a member or with observer status. They include the following eight, in each of which Vatican City State holds membership:[95][96]\n\n\n\n* European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT)\n* European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Eutelsat IGO)\n* International Grains Council (IGC)\n* International Institute of Administrative Sciences (IIAS)\n* International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\n* International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (ITSO)\n* Interpol[97]\n* Universal Postal Union (UPU)\n\n\nIt also participates in:[95]\n\n\n\n* World Medical Association\n* World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)\n\n\n### Non-party, non-signatory policy[edit]\n\n\nThe Vatican City is not a member of the United Nations (UN), but was granted observer status to the United Nations General Assembly in 1968; the only other country in a similar position is the partially recognised State of Palestine. Since it is not a member of the UN, the Vatican City is not subjected to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It does, however, engage with various UN specialised agencies through its observer status including the Central Emergency Response Fund, to which it contributed US$20,000 between 2006 and 2022.[98]\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is not a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC). In Europe, only Belarus is also a non-party, non-signatory state, while Ukraine and Monaco are signatory states that have not ratified and Russia withdrew from it in 2016.\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is not a member of the European Court of Human Rights. Among European states, Belarus is also not a member, while Russia has ceased to be part of it after being expelled from the Council of Europe following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\nThe OECD's \"Common Reporting Standard\" (CRS), aiming at preventing tax evasion and money laundering, has also not been signed.[99][100][101] The Vatican City State has been criticised for money laundering practises in the past decades.[102][103][104] The only other country in Europe that has not agreed to sign the CRS is Belarus.\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is also one of few countries in the world that does not provide any publicly available financial data to the International Monetary Fund.[105]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Vatican City\n\nThe Vatican City State budget includes the Vatican Museums and post office and is supported financially by the sale of stamps, coins, medals and tourist mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publications sales.[j] The incomes and living standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome.[106] Other industries include printing, the production of mosaics, and the manufacture of staff uniforms. There is a Vatican Pharmacy.\n\n\n\n![](image)Vatican Museums' \"New Wing\", built by Raffaele Stern (1774–1820)\nThe Institute for Works of Religion (IOR, *Istituto per le Opere di Religione*), also known as the Vatican Bank, is a financial agency situated in the Vatican that conducts worldwide financial activities. It has multilingual ATMs with instructions in Latin, possibly the only ATM in the world with this feature.[107]\n\n\nVatican City issues its own coins and stamps. It has used the euro as its currency since 1 January 1999, owing to a special agreement with the European Union (council decision 1999/98/EC). Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1 January 2002—the Vatican does not issue euro banknotes. Issuance of euro-denominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than usual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy.[108] Because of their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.[109] Until the adoption of the Euro, Vatican coinage and stamps were denominated in their own Vatican lira currency, which was on par with the Italian lira.\n\n\nVatican City State, which employs nearly 2,000 people, had a surplus of 6.7 million euros in 2007 but ran a deficit in 2008 of over 15 million euros.[110]\n\n\nIn 2012, the US Department of State's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report listed Vatican City for the first time among the nations of concern for money-laundering, placing it in the middle category, which includes countries such as Ireland, but not among the most vulnerable countries, which include the United States itself, Germany, Italy, and Russia.[111]\n\n\nOn 24 February 2014, the Vatican announced it was establishing a secretariat for the economy, to be responsible for all economic, financial, and administrative activities of the Holy See and the Vatican City State, headed by Cardinal George Pell. This followed the charging of two senior clerics including a monsignor with money laundering offences. Pope Francis also appointed an auditor-general authorised to carry out random audits of any agency at any time and engaged a US financial services company to review the Vatican's 19,000 accounts to ensure compliance with international money laundering practices. The pontiff also ordered that the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See would be the Vatican's central bank, with responsibilities similar to other central banks around the world.[112]\n\n\nIn 2022, the Vatican planned to release NFTs of its museum collection.[113]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Women in Vatican City\n\nAs of 2023, Vatican City had a population of 764 residents, regardless of citizenship.[13] There were also 372 Vatican citizens residing elsewhere,[13] consisting of diplomats of the Holy See to other countries and cardinals residing in Rome.[114]\n\n\nThe population is composed of clergy, other religious members, laypeople serving the state (such as the Swiss Guard) and their family members.[115] In 2013 there were 13 families of the employees of the Holy See living in Vatican City,[116] in 2019 there were 20 children of the Swiss Guards living at the Vatican.[117] All citizens, residents and places of worship in the city are Catholic. The city also receives thousands of tourists and workers every day.\n\n\n\nVatican City population on 26 June 2023[13]\n| Sex | all\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Citizenship | Vatican | other\n |\n| Residency | other | Vatican City\n |\n| Pope |  | 1 |  |\n| Cardinals | 55 | 9 |  |\n| Diplomats | 317 |  |  |\n| Swiss Guard |  | 104 |  |\n| Others |  | 132 | 518\n |\n| Total | 618 | 518\n |\n| 372 | 246\n |\n| 764\n |\n| 1,136\n |\n\nVatican City population on 1 March 2011[115]\n| Sex | all | male | female\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Citizenship | Vatican | other | Vatican | other | Vatican | other\n |\n| Residency | other | Vatican City | other | Vatican City | other | Vatican City\n |\n| Pope |  | 1 |  |  | 1 |  |  |  |  |\n| Cardinals | 43 | 30 |  | 43 | 30 |  |  |  |  |\n| Diplomats | 306 |  |  | 306 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Swiss Guard |  | 86 |  |  | 86 |  |  |  |  |\n| Other religious |  | 50 | 197 |  | 49 | 102 |  | 1 | 95\n |\n| Other lay |  | 56 | 24 |  | 25 | 3 |  | 31 | 21\n |\n| Total | 572 | 221 | 540 | 105 | 32 | 116\n |\n| 349 | 223 | 349 | 191 |  | 32\n |\n| 444 | 296 | 148\n |\n| 793 | 645 | 148\n |\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Languages of Vatican City\n\n![](image)The Seal of Vatican City. Note the use of the Italian language.\nVatican City has no formally enacted official language, but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses Latin for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.[118] Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, Italian or Romansh. The official websites of the Holy See[119] and of Vatican City[120] are primarily in Italian, with versions of their pages in a large number of languages to varying extents.\n\n\n\n### Citizenship[edit]\n\n\nUnlike citizenship of other states, which is based either on *jus sanguinis* (birth from a citizen, even outside the state's territory) or on *jus soli* (birth within the territory of the state), citizenship of Vatican City is granted on *jus officii*, namely on the grounds of appointment to work in a certain capacity in the service of the Holy See. It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is also extended to the spouse and children of a citizen, provided they are living together in the city.[114] Some individuals are also authorized to reside in the city but do not qualify or choose not to request citizenship.[114] Anyone who loses Vatican citizenship and does not possess other citizenship automatically becomes an Italian citizen as provided in the Lateran Treaty.[55]\n\n\nThe Holy See, not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City issues normal passports for its citizens.\n\n\n\n### Statistical oddities[edit]\n\n\nIn statistics comparing countries in various per capita or per area metrics, Vatican City is often an outlier—these can stem from the state's small size and ecclesiastical function.[121] For example, as most of the roles which would confer citizenship are reserved for men, the gender ratio of the citizenship is several men per woman.[122] Further oddities are petty crimes against tourists resulting in a very high per-capita crime rate,[123] and the city-state leading the world in per-capita wine consumption due to its sacramental use.[121] A jocular illustration of these anomalies is sometimes made by calculating a \"Popes per km2\" statistic, which is greater than two because the country is less than half a square kilometre in area.[124]\n\n\n\n![360-degree view from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, looking over the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square (centre) and out into Rome, showing Vatican City in all directions](image)\n360-degree view from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, looking over the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square (centre) and out into Rome, showing Vatican City in all directions\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Vatican City\n\nSee also: Music of Vatican City and Sport in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The Vatican Museums (*Musei Vaticani*) display works from the extensive collection of the Catholic Church.\nVatican City is home to some of the most famous art in the world. St. Peter's Basilica, whose successive architects include Bramante, Michelangelo, Giacomo della Porta, Maderno and Bernini, is a renowned work of Renaissance architecture. The Sistine Chapel is famous for its frescos, which include works by Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Botticelli as well as the ceiling and Last Judgment by Michelangelo. Artists who decorated the interiors of the Vatican include Raphael and Fra Angelico.\n\n\nThe Vatican Apostolic Library and the collections of the Vatican Museums are of the highest historical, scientific and cultural importance.[125] In 1984, the Vatican was added by UNESCO to the List of World Heritage Sites; it is the only one to consist of an entire state.[126] Furthermore, it is the only site to date registered with the UNESCO as a *centre containing monuments* in the \"International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection\" according to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.[126]\n\n\nFootball in Vatican City is organized by the Vatican Amateur Sports Association, which holds the national championship, called the Vatican City Championship, with eight teams, including, for example, the Swiss Guard's FC Guardia and police and museum guard teams.[127] The association also organizes the Coppa Sergio Valci and the Vatican Supercoppa. It controls the Vatican City national football team, which is neither affiliated with UEFA or FIFA.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The shortest national railway system in the world\nVatican City has a reasonably well-developed transport network considering its size (consisting mostly of a piazza and walkways). As a state that is 1.05 kilometres (1,150 yards) long and 0.85 km (930 yd) wide,[128] it has a small transportation system with no airports or highways. The only aviation facility in Vatican City is the Vatican City Heliport. Vatican City is one of the few independent countries without an airport, and is served by the airports that serve the city of Rome, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport and to a lesser extent Ciampino Airport.[129]\n\n\nThere is a standard gauge railway, mainly used to transport freight, connected to Italy's network at Rome's Saint Peter's station by an 852-metre-long (932 yd) spur, 300 metres (330 yd) of which is within Vatican territory.[129] Pope John XXIII was the first Pope to make use of the railway; Pope John Paul II rarely used it.[129]\n\n\nThe closest metro station is Ottaviano – San Pietro – Musei Vaticani.[130]\n\n\n\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Vatican's post office was established on 11 February 1929.\nThe City is served by an independent, modern telephone system named the Vatican Telephone Service,[131] and a postal system (Poste Vaticane) that started operating on 13 February 1929. On 1 August, the state started to release its own postal stamps, under the authority of the Philatelic and Numismatic Office of the Vatican City State.[132] The city's postal service is sometimes said to be \"the best in the world\",[133] and faster than the postal service in Rome.[133]\n\n\nThe Vatican also controls its own Internet top-level domain, which is registered as (.va). Broadband service is widely provided within Vatican City. Vatican City has also been given a radio ITU prefix, HV, and this is sometimes used by amateur radio operators.\n\n\nVatican Radio, which was organised by Guglielmo Marconi, broadcasts on short-wave, medium-wave and FM frequencies and on the Internet.[134] Its main transmission antennae are located in Italian territory, and exceed Italian environmental protection levels of emission. For this reason, the Vatican Radio has been sued. Television services are provided through another entity, the Vatican Television Center.[135]\n\n\n*L'Osservatore Romano* is the multilingual semi-official newspaper of the Holy See. It is published by a private corporation under the direction of Catholic laymen, but reports on official information. However, the official texts of documents are in the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*, the official gazette of the Holy See, which has an appendix for documents of the Vatican City State.\n\n\nVatican Radio, the Vatican Television Center, and L'Osservatore Romano are organs not of the Vatican State but of the Holy See, and are listed as such in the *Annuario Pontificio*, which places them in the section \"Institutions linked with the Holy See\", ahead of the sections on the Holy See's diplomatic service abroad and the diplomatic corps accredited to the Holy See, after which is placed the section on the State of Vatican City.\n\n\n\n### Recycling[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the Vatican began an \"ecological island\" for renewable waste and has continued the initiative throughout the papacy of Francis. These innovations included, for example, the installation of a solar power system on the roof of the Paul VI Audience Hall. In July 2019, it was announced that Vatican City would ban the use and sale of single-use plastics as soon as its supply was depleted, well before the 2021 deadline established by the European Union. It is estimated that 50–55% of Vatican City's municipal solid waste is properly sorted and recycled, with the goal of reaching the EU standard of 70–75%.[136]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Vatican City portal\n* ![flag](image)Italy portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Architecture of Vatican City\n* Holy city\n* Index of Vatican City-related articles\n* Law of Vatican City\n* News.va\n* Outline of Vatican City\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Many other languages are used by institutions situated within the state, such as the Holy See, the Pontifical Swiss Guard, and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  \nThe Holy See uses Latin as its main official language, Italian as its main working language and French as its main diplomatic language; in addition, its Secretariat of State uses English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. The Swiss Guard, in which commands on parade are given in German, also uses French and Italian, two of the three other official Swiss languages, in its official ceremonies, such as the annual swearing in of the new recruits on 6 May.[3]\n2. **^** All powers delegated by the sovereign[9][10]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The De Agostini Atlas Calendar listed the area of Vatican City as 44 ha in its 1930 edition[11] but corrected it to 49 ha in its 1945–1946 edition.[12] The figure of 44 ha is still widely cited by many sources despite its inaccuracy.\n4. **^** Visitors and tourists are not permitted to drive inside Vatican City without specific permission, which is normally granted only to those on official business in Vatican City.\n5. **^** ITU-T assigned code 379 to Vatican City.

Moreover, an annual collection taken up in dioceses and direct donations go to a non-budgetary fund known as Peter's Pence, which is used directly by the Pope for charity, disaster relief and aid to churches in developing nations.\n\n### Citation notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Reuters Staff (6 October 2014). \"Pope ditches Latin as official language of Vatican synod\". *Reuters*.\n2. **^** \"What language is spoken at the Vatican?\". *Visiting The Vatican*. 13 April 2023.

During their term of office, the officeholder is responsible for directing the work of the government and in charge of foreign relations. As the monarch's representative, the prime minister also presides (with voting powers) over the Council of Government, directs the executive services and commands the police and military.\n\n\nSince 1 September 2020, Pierre Dartout has been the prime minister.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## History of the office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official residence of the prime minister\nThe office was created in 1911 with the adoption of Monaco's constitution. Until the revision of the constitution of 2002, the prime minister had to be a French citizen,[*citation needed*] selected from several senior civil servants proposed by the French government.

Its nearest neighbour is Banaba of Kiribati, about 300 km (190 mi) to the east.[13] It lies northwest of Tuvalu, 1,300 km (810 mi) northeast of Solomon Islands,[14] east-northeast of Papua New Guinea, southeast of the Federated States of Micronesia and south of the Marshall Islands. With an area of only 21 km2 (8.1 sq mi), Nauru is the third-smallest country in the world behind Vatican City and Monaco, making it the smallest republic and island nation. Its population of about 10,800 is the world's second-smallest (not including colonies or overseas territories) after Vatican City.\nSettled by people from Micronesia circa 1000 BCE, Nauru was annexed and claimed as a colony by the German Empire in the late 19th century. After World War I, Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. During World War II, Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops, and was bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. After the war ended, the country entered into United Nations trusteeship. Nauru gained its independence in 1968.\n\n\nNauru is a phosphate-rock island with rich deposits near the surface, which allowed easy strip mining operations for over a century. However, this has seriously harmed the country's environment, causing the island nation to suffer from what is often referred to as the \"resource curse\". The phosphate was exhausted in the 1990s, and the remaining reserves are not economically viable for extraction.[15] A trust established to manage the island's accumulated mining wealth, set up for the day the reserves would be exhausted, has diminished in value. To earn income, Nauru briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre.[16] At various points since 2001, it has accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange for hosting the Nauru Regional Processing Centre, a controversial offshore Australian immigration detention facility. As a result of heavy dependence on Australia, some sources have identified Nauru as a client state of Australia.[17][18][19] The sovereign state is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Organization of African, Caribbean, and Pacific States.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Nauru and British Western Pacific Territories\n\n![](image)Photo of a Nauruan warrior during the Nauruan Civil War around 1880\nNauru was first settled by Micronesians at least 3,000 years ago, and there is evidence of possible Polynesian influence.[20] Comparatively little is known of Nauruan prehistory,[21] although the island is believed to have had a long period of isolation, which accounts for the distinct language that developed among the inhabitants.[22] There were traditionally 12 clans or tribes on Nauru, which are represented in the twelve-pointed star on the country's flag.[23] Traditionally, Nauruans traced their descent matrilineally. Inhabitants practised aquaculture: they caught juvenile milkfish (known as *Ibija* in Nauruan), acclimatised them to freshwater, and raised them in Buada Lagoon, providing a reliable food source. The other locally grown components of their diet included coconuts and pandanus fruit.[24][25] The name \"Nauru\" may derive from the Nauruan word **Anáoero**, which means 'I go to the beach.'[26]\n\n\nIn 1798, the British sea captain John Fearn, on his trading ship *Hunter* (300 tons), became the first Westerner to report sighting Nauru, calling it \"Pleasant Island\", because of its attractive appearance.[27][28] From at least 1826, Nauruans had regular contact with Europeans on whaling and trading ships who called for provisions and fresh drinking water.[29] The last whaler to call during the age of sail visited in 1904.[30]\n\n\nAround this time, deserters from European ships began to live on the island. The islanders traded food for alcoholic palm wine and firearms.[31] The firearms were used during the 10-year Nauruan Civil War that began in 1878.[32]\n\n\nAfter an agreement with Great Britain, Nauru was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany's Marshall Islands Protectorate for administrative purposes.[33][34] The arrival of the Germans ended the civil war, and kings were established as rulers of the island. The most widely known of these was King Auweyida. Christian missionaries from the Gilbert Islands arrived in 1888.[35][36] The German settlers called the island \"Nawodo\" or \"Onawero\".[37] The Germans ruled Nauru for almost three decades. Robert Rasch, a German trader who married a Nauruan woman, was the first administrator, appointed in 1890.[35]\n\n\nPhosphate was discovered on Nauru in 1900 by the prospector Albert Fuller Ellis.[34][28] The Pacific Phosphate Company began to exploit the reserves in 1906 by agreement with Germany, exporting its first shipment in 1907.[27][38] In 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, Nauru was captured by Australian troops. In 1919, it was agreed by the Allied and Associated Powers that His Britannic Majesty should be the administering authority under a League of Nations mandate. The Nauru Island Agreement forged in 1919 between the governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand provided for the administration of the island and extraction of the phosphate deposits by an intergovernmental British Phosphate Commission (BPC).[33][39] The terms of the League of Nations mandate were drawn up in 1920.[33][40]\n\n\nThe island experienced an influenza epidemic and ongoing colonial strife through the early 20th century, with a mortality rate of 18 per cent among native Nauruans.[41] In 1923, the League of Nations gave Australia a trustee mandate over Nauru, with the United Kingdom and New Zealand as co-trustees.[42] On 6 and 7 December 1940, the German auxiliary cruisers *Komet* and *Orion* sank five supply ships in the vicinity of Nauru. *Komet* then shelled Nauru's phosphate mining areas, oil storage depots, and the shiploading cantilever.[43][44][45]\n\n\n\n![](image)U.S. Army Air Forces bombing the Japanese airstrip on Nauru, 1943.[46]\nJapanese troops occupied Nauru on 25 August 1942.[44] The Japanese built 2 airfields which were bombed for the first time on 25 March 1943, preventing food supplies from being flown to Nauru.[47] The Japanese deported 1,200 Nauruans to work as labourers in the Chuuk Islands,[46] which was also occupied by Japan. As part of the Allied strategy of island hopping from the Pacific islands towards the main islands of Japan, Nauru was bypassed and left to \"wither on the vine\". Nauru was finally taken back from the Japanese on 13 September 1945, when commander Hisayaki Soeda surrendered the island to the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy.[48] The surrender was accepted by Brigadier J. R. Stevenson, who represented Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee, the commander of the First Australian Army, aboard the warship HMAS *Diamantina*.[49][50][51] Arrangements were made to repatriate from Chuuk the 745 Nauruans who survived Japanese captivity there.[52] They were returned to Nauru by the BPC ship *Trienza* in January 1946.[53]\n\n\nIn 1947, a trusteeship was established by the United Nations, with Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as trustees.[54][55] Under those arrangements, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand were a joint administering authority. The Nauru Island Agreement provided for the first administrator to be appointed by Australia for five years, leaving subsequent appointments to be decided by the three governments.[33][40] However, in practice, administrative power was exercised by Australia alone.[33][40]\n\n\nThe 1948 Nauru riots occurred when Chinese guano mining workers went on strike over pay and conditions. The Australian administration imposed a state of emergency with Native Police and armed volunteers of locals and Australian officials being mobilised. This force, using sub-machine guns and other firearms, opened fire on the Chinese workers killing two and wounding sixteen. Around 50 of the workers were arrested and two of these were bayoneted to death while in custody. The trooper who bayoneted the prisoners was charged but later acquitted on grounds that the wounds were \"accidentally received.\"[56][57] The governments of the Soviet Union and China made official complaints against Australia at the United Nations over this incident.[58]\n\n\nIn 1964, it was proposed to relocate the population of Nauru to Curtis Island off the coast of Queensland, Australia. By that time, Nauru had been extensively mined for phosphate by companies from Australia, Britain, and New Zealand, damaging the landscape so much that it was thought the island would be uninhabitable by the 1990s. Rehabilitating the island was seen as financially impossible. In 1962, Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies said that the three countries involved in the mining had an obligation to provide a solution for the Nauruan people, and proposed finding a new island for them. In 1963, the Australian Government proposed to acquire all the land on Curtis Island (which was considerably larger than Nauru) and then offer the Nauruans freehold title over the island and that the Nauruans would become Australian citizens.[59][60] The cost of resettling the Nauruans on Curtis Island was estimated to be £10 million (A$324 million in 2022[61]), which included housing and infrastructure and the establishment of pastoral, agricultural, and fishing industries.[62] However, the Nauruan people did not wish to become Australian citizens and wanted to be given sovereignty over Curtis Island to establish themselves as an independent nation, which Australia would not agree to.[63] Nauru rejected the proposal to move to Curtis Island, instead choosing to become an independent nation operating their mines in Nauru.[64]\n\n\nNauru became self-governing in January 1966, and following a two-year constitutional convention, it became independent on 31 January 1968 under founding president Hammer DeRoburt.[65] In 1967, the people of Nauru purchased the assets of the British Phosphate Commissioners, and in June 1970, control passed to the locally owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation (NPC).[38] Income from the mines made Nauruans among the richest people in the world.[66][67] In 1989, Nauru took legal action against Australia in the International Court of Justice over Australia's administration of the island, in particular, Australia's failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by phosphate mining. *Certain Phosphate Lands: Nauru v. Australia* led to an out-of-court settlement to rehabilitate the mined-out areas of Nauru.[54][68]\n\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a state of emergency was declared in Nauru on 17 March 2020. The declaration to minimize the outbreak was signed by President Lionel Aingimea during a period of 30 days.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Nauru and Geology of Nauru\n\n![](image)Map of Nauru\nNauru is a 21 km2 (8.1 sq mi),[3] oval-shaped island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, 55.95 km (34.77 mi) south of the Equator.[69] The island is surrounded by a coral reef, which is exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles.[4] The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a seaport, although channels in the reef allow small boats access to the island.[70] A fertile coastal strip 150 to 300 m (490 to 980 ft) wide lies inland from the beach.[4]\n\n\nCoral cliffs surround Nauru's central plateau. The highest point of the plateau, called the Command Ridge, is 71 m (233 ft) above sea level.[71]\n\n\nThe only fertile areas on Nauru are on the narrow coastal belt, where coconut palms flourish. The land around Buada Lagoon supports bananas, pineapples, vegetables, pandanus trees, and indigenous hardwoods, such as the tamanu tree.[4]\n\n\nNauru was one of three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean, along with Banaba (Ocean Island), in Kiribati, and Makatea, in French Polynesia. The phosphate reserves on Nauru are now almost entirely depleted. Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to 15 m (49 ft) high. Mining has stripped and devastated about 80 per cent of Nauru's land area, leaving it uninhabitable[67] and has also affected the surrounding exclusive economic zone; 40 per cent of marine life is estimated to have been killed by silt and phosphate runoff.[4][72]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nNauru's climate is hot and very humid year-round because of its proximity to the equator and the ocean. Nauru is hit by monsoon rains between November and February. Annual rainfall is highly variable and is influenced by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, with several significant recorded droughts.[20][73] The temperature on Nauru ranges between 30 and 35 °C (86 and 95 °F) during the day and is quite stable at around 25 °C (77 °F) at night.[74]\n\n\nStreams and rivers do not exist in Nauru. Water is gathered from roof catchment systems. Water is brought to Nauru as ballast on ships returning for loads of phosphate.[75]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Yaren District, Nauru\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 34(93)\n | 37(99)\n | 35(95)\n | 35(95)\n | 32(90)\n | 32(90)\n | 35(95)\n | 33(91)\n | 35(95)\n | 34(93)\n | 36(97)\n | 35(95)\n | 37(99)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 31(88)\n | 31(88)\n | 31(88)\n | 30(87)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 280(11.0)\n | 250(9.8)\n | 190(7.5)\n | 190(7.5)\n | 120(4.7)\n | 110(4.3)\n | 150(5.9)\n | 130(5.1)\n | 120(4.7)\n | 100(3.9)\n | 120(4.7)\n | 280(11.0)\n | 2,080(81.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation days\n | 16\n | 14\n | 13\n | 11\n | 9\n | 9\n | 12\n | 14\n | 11\n | 10\n | 13\n | 15\n | 152\n |\n| Source: Weatherbase |\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Nauru\n### Ecology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eastern Micronesia tropical moist forests and List of mammals of Nauru\n\nFauna is sparse on the island because of a lack of vegetation and the consequences of phosphate mining. Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to the destruction of their habitat.[76] There are about 60 recorded vascular plant species native to the island, none of which are endemic. Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have seriously disturbed the native vegetation.[20]\n\n\nThere are no native land mammals, but there are native insects, land crabs, and birds, including the endemic Nauru reed warbler. The Polynesian rat, cats, dogs, pigs, and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships.[77] The diversity of the reef marine life makes fishing a popular activity for tourists on the island; also popular are scuba diving and snorkelling.[78]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Nauru and Elections in Nauru\n\nFurther information: Law of Nauru, List of political parties in Nauru, and Crime in Nauru\n\n![](image)Parliament of Nauru\nThe president of Nauru is David Adeang, who heads a 19-member unicameral parliament. The country is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Asian Development Bank. Nauru also participates in the Commonwealth and Olympic Games. Recently Nauru became a member country of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The Republic of Nauru became the 189th member of the International Monetary Fund in April 2016.\n\n\nNauru is a republic with a parliamentary system of government.[65] The president is both head of state and head of government and is dependent on parliamentary confidence to remain president. All 19 parliament seats are elected every three years.[79] The parliament elects the president from its members, and the president appoints a cabinet of five to six members.[80] As a result of a referendum in 2021, naturalised citizens and their descendants are barred from becoming parliamentarians.\n\n\nNauru does not have any formal structure for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19 members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed based on extended family ties rather than party affiliation.[81]\n\n\nFrom 1992 to 1999, Nauru had a local government system known as the Nauru Island Council (NIC).[82] It was a successor to the Nauru Local Government Council, established in 1951.[83] This nine-member council was designed to provide municipal services. The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government.[82] Land tenure on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, which is owned by individuals and family groups. Government and corporate entities do not own any land, and they must enter into a lease arrangement with landowners to use land. Non-Nauruans cannot own land on the island.[20]\n\n\nNauru's Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice, is paramount on constitutional issues. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions. Historically, Appellate Court rulings could be appealed to the High Court of Australia,[84][85] though this happened only rarely and the Australian court's appellate jurisdiction ended entirely on 12 March 2018 after the Government of Nauru unilaterally ended the arrangement.[86][87][88] Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. There are two other quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.[4]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Nauru\n\nFollowing independence in 1968, Nauru joined the Commonwealth of Nations as a Special Member; it became a full member in 1999.[89] The country was admitted to the Asian Development Bank in 1991 and the United Nations in 1999.[90] Nauru is a member of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme, the Pacific Community, and the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission.[91] In February 2021, Nauru announced it would be formally withdrawing from the Pacific Islands Forum in a joint statement with Marshall Islands, Kiribati, and the Federated States of Micronesia after a dispute regarding Henry Puna's election as the Forum's secretary-general.[92][93]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nauruan police cadets undergoing training. Nauru has no armed forces, though there is a small police force under civilian control.\nNauru has no armed forces, though there is a small police force under civilian control.[3] Australia is responsible for Nauru's defence under an informal agreement between the two countries.[3] The September 2005 memorandum of understanding between Australia and Nauru provides the latter with financial aid and technical assistance, including a Secretary of Finance to prepare the budget, and advisers on health and education. This aid is in return for Nauru's housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed.[94] Nauru uses the Australian dollar as its official currency.[4]\n\n\nNauru has used its position as a member of the United Nations to gain financial support from both Taiwan (officially the Republic of China or ROC) and mainland China (officially the People's Republic of China or PRC) by changing its recognition from one to the other under the One-China policy. On 21 July 2002, Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC, accepting US$130 million from the PRC for this action[95] (US$211 million in 2023[96]). In response, the ROC severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later. Nauru later re-established links with the ROC on 14 May 2005,[97] and diplomatic ties with the PRC were officially severed on 31 May 2005.[98]\n\n\nIn 2008, Nauru recognised Kosovo as an independent country, and in 2009 Nauru became the fourth country, after Russia, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, to recognise Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia. Russia was reported to be giving Nauru US$50 million in humanitarian aid as a result of this recognition[95] ($69.5 million in 2023[96]). On 15 July 2008, the Nauruan government announced a port refurbishment programme, financed with US$9 million of development aid received from Russia ($12.5 million in 2023[96]). The Nauru government claimed this aid is not related to its recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.[99]\n\n\nA significant portion of Nauru's income has been in the form of aid from Australia. In 2001, the MV *Tampa*, a Norwegian ship that had rescued 438 refugees from a stranded 20-metre-long boat, was seeking to dock in Australia. In what became known as the *Tampa* affair, the ship was refused entry and boarded by Australian troops. The refugees were eventually loaded onto Royal Australian Navy vessel HMAS *Manoora* and taken to Nauru to be held in detention facilities which later became part of the Howard government's Pacific Solution. Nauru operated two detention centres known as State House and Topside for these refugees in exchange for Australian aid.[100] By November 2005, only two refugees, Mohammed Sagar and Muhammad Faisal remained on Nauru from those first sent there in 2001,[101] with Sagar finally resettling in early 2007. The Australian government sent further groups of asylum-seekers to Nauru in late 2006 and early 2007.[102] The refugee centre was closed in 2008,[4] but, following the Australian government's re-adoption of the Pacific Solution in August 2012, it has re-opened it.[103] The US Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program operates a climate-monitoring facility on the island.[104]\n\n\nIn March 2017, at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council, Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of Nauru and some other Pacific nations raising human rights violations in Western New Guinea, which has been occupied by Indonesia since 1963,[105] and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report.[106][107] Indonesia rejected the allegations.[107] More than 100,000 Papuans have died during a 50-year Papua conflict.[108]\n\n\nAmnesty International has since described the conditions of the refugees of war living in Nauru as a \"horror\",[109][110] with reports of children as young as eight attempting suicide and engaging in acts of self-harm.[111] In 2018, the situation gained attention as a \"mental health crisis\", with an estimated thirty children suffering from traumatic withdrawal syndrome, also known as resignation syndrome.[111][112]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of settlements in Nauru\n\n![](image)Map of Nauru showing its districts\nNauru is divided into fourteen administrative districts, which are grouped into eight electoral constituencies and are further divided into villages.[4][3] The most populous district is Denigomodu, with 1,804 residents, of which 1,497 reside in an RONPhos settlement called \"Location\". The following table shows population by district according to the 2011 census.[113]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| No. | District | Formername | Area(ha) | Population(2011) | No. ofvillages | Density(persons/ha)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Aiwo | Aiue | 110 | 1,220 | 8 | 11.1\n |\n| 2 | Anabar | Anebwor | 150 | 452 | 15 | 3.0\n |\n| 3 | Anetan | Añetañ | 100 | 587 | 12 | 5.9\n |\n| 4 | Anibare | Anybody | 310 | 226 | 17 | 0.7\n |\n| 5 | Baitsi | Beidi, Baiti | 120 | 513 | 15 | 4.3\n |\n| 6 | Boe | Boi | 50 | 851 | 4 | 17.0\n |\n| 7 | Buada | Arenibok | 260 | 739 | 14 | 2.8\n |\n| 8 | Denigomodu | Denikomotu | 118 | 1,804 | 17 | 15.3\n |\n| 9 | Ewa | Eoa | 120 | 446 | 12 | 3.7\n |\n| 10 | Ijuw | Ijub | 110 | 178 | 13 | 1.6\n |\n| 11 | Meneng | Meneñ | 310 | 1,380 | 18 | 4.5\n |\n| 12 | Nibok | Ennibeck | 160 | 484 | 11 | 3.0\n |\n| 13 | Uaboe | Ueboi | 80 | 318 | 6 | 3.0\n |\n| 14 | Yaren | Moqua | 150 | 747 | 7 | 4.0\n |\n| – | **Nauru** | Naoero | 2,120 | 10,084 | 169 | 4.8\n |\n\n |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Nauru and Telecommunications in Nauru\n\n![](image)A satellite image of Nauru, 2002\nBefore a resurgence in the 2010s, the Nauruan economy was strongest in the 1970s, with GDP peaking in 1981.[114][115] This trend came from phosphate mining, which accounted for a majority of its economic output. Mining declined starting in the early 1980s.[116]: 5 There are few other resources, and most necessities are imported.[4][117] Small-scale mining is still conducted by RONPhos, formerly known as the Nauru Phosphate Corporation.[4] The government places a percentage of RONPhos's earnings into the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. The trust manages long-term investments, which were intended to support the citizens after the phosphate reserves were exhausted.[118]\n\n\nBecause of mismanagement, the trust's fixed and current assets were reduced considerably and may never fully recover. The failed investments included financing *Leonardo the Musical* in 1993.[119] The Mercure Hotel in Sydney[120] and Nauru House in Melbourne were sold in 2004 to finance debts and Air Nauru's only Boeing 737 was repossessed in December 2005. Normal air service resumed after the aircraft was replaced with a Boeing 737-300 airliner in June 2006.[121] In 2005, the corporation sold its remaining real estate in Melbourne, the vacant Savoy Tavern site, for $7.5 million[122] (US$11.2 million in 2023[96]).\n\n\nThe value of the trust is estimated to have shrunk from A$1.3 billion in 1991 to A$138 million in 2002 (A$2.79 billion to A$229 million in 2022 dollars[61]).[123] Nauru currently lacks money to perform many of the basic functions of government; for example, the National Bank of Nauru is insolvent. The CIA World Factbook estimated a GDP per capita of US$5,000 in 2005.[3] The Asian Development Bank 2007 economic report on Nauru estimated GDP per capita at US$2,400 to US$2,715.[116]\n\n\nThere are no personal taxes in Nauru. The unemployment rate is estimated to be 23 per cent and the government employs 95 per cent of those who have jobs.[3][124] The Asian Development Bank notes that, although the administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms, in the absence of an alternative to phosphate mining, the medium-term outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance.[123] Tourism is not a major contributor to the economy.[125]\n\n\n\n![](image)Limestone pinnacles remain after phosphate mining at the site of one of Nauru's secondary mines\nIn the 1990s, Nauru became a tax haven and offered passports to foreign nationals for a fee.[126] The inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) identified Nauru as one of 15 \"non-cooperative\" countries in its fight against money laundering. During the 1990s, it was possible to establish a licensed bank in Nauru for only US$25,000[126] (US$42,040 in 2023[96]) with no other requirements. Under pressure from FATF, Nauru introduced anti-avoidance legislation in 2003, after which foreign hot money left the country. In October 2005, after satisfactory results from the legislation and its enforcement, FATF lifted the non-cooperative designation.[127]\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007, the Nauru detention centre provided a significant source of income for the country. The Nauruan authorities reacted with concern to its closure by Australia.[128] In February 2008, the Foreign Affairs minister, Kieren Keke, stated that the closure would result in 100 Nauruans losing their jobs, and would affect 10 per cent of the island's population directly or indirectly: \"We have got a huge number of families that are suddenly going to be without any income. We are looking at ways we can try and provide some welfare assistance but our capacity to do that is very limited. Literally we have got a major unemployment crisis in front of us.\"[129] The detention centre was re-opened in August 2012.[103]\n\n\nIn July 2017 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) upgraded its rating of Nauru's standards of tax transparency. Previously Nauru had been listed alongside fourteen other countries that had failed to show that they could comply with international tax transparency standards and regulations. The OECD subsequently put Nauru through a fast-tracked compliance process and the country was given a \"largely compliant\" rating.[130]\n\n\nThe Nauru 2017–2018 budget, delivered by Minister of Finance David Adeang, forecast A$128.7 million in revenues and A$128.6 million in expenditures and projected modest economic growth for the nation over the next two years.[131] In 2018 the Nauru government partnered with the deep sea mining company DeepGreen, now Nauru Ocean Resources Inc (NORI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canadian The Metals Company.[132] They planned to harvest manganese nodules whose minerals and metals can be used in the development of sustainable energy technology.[133][134][135]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Nauru\n\n![Demographic pyramid of Nauru, 2015](image)\nNauru had 12,511 residents as of July 2021.[6][7] The population was previously larger, but in 2006 the island saw 1,500 people leave during a repatriation of immigrant workers from Kiribati and Tuvalu. The repatriation was motivated by significant layoffs in phosphate mining.[116]\n\n\nNauru is one of the most densely populated Westernized countries in the South Pacific.[136]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFifty-eight per cent of people in Nauru are ethnically Nauruan, 26 per cent are other Pacific Islander, 8 per cent are European, and 8 per cent are Han Chinese.[3]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nauruan language\n\nThe official languages of Nauru are Nauruan and English. Nauruan[1] is a distinct Micronesian language, which is spoken by 96 per cent of ethnic Nauruans at home.[116] English is widely spoken and is the language of government and commerce.[3][4]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Religion in Nauru\n\n![](image)Church in Nauru\nThe main religion practised on the island is Christianity (the main denominations are Nauru Congregational Church 35.71%, Roman Catholic 32.96%, Assemblies of God 12.98%, and Baptist 1.48%).[4] The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. The government has restricted the religious practices of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Jehovah's Witnesses, most of whom are foreign workers employed by the government-owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation.[137] The Catholics are pastorally served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarawa and Nauru, with see at Tarawa in Kiribati.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of Nauru, Music of Nauru, and Nauruan cuisine\n\nAngam Day, held on 26 October, celebrates the recovery of the Nauruan population after the two world wars and the 1920 influenza epidemic.[138] Colonial and contemporary Western influence has largely displaced the indigenous culture.[139] Few older customs have been preserved, but some forms of traditional music, arts and crafts, and fishing are still practised.[140]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mass media in Nauru\n\nThere are no daily news publications on Nauru, although there is one fortnightly publication, *Mwinen Ko*. There is a state-owned television station, Nauru Television (NTV), which broadcasts programs from New Zealand and Australia, and a state-owned non-commercial radio station, Radio Nauru, which carries programs from Radio Australia and the BBC.[141]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Soccer in Nauru\n\n![](image)Australian rules football, played at Linkbelt Oval\nAustralian rules football is the most popular sport in Nauru; it and weightlifting are considered the country's national sports. There is an Australian rules football league with eight teams.[142] The Nauruan national team for Australian rules football are the Chiefs. Other sports popular in Nauru include volleyball, netball, fishing, weightlifting and tennis. Nauru participates in the Commonwealth Games and has participated in the Summer Olympic Games in weightlifting and judo.[143]\n\n\nNauru's national basketball team competed at the 1969 Pacific Games, where it defeated Solomon Islands and Fiji.\n\n\nThe Nauru national rugby sevens team made its international debut at the 2015 Pacific Games.[144]\n\n\nNauru competed in the 2015 Oceania Sevens Championship in New Zealand.\n\n\n\n### Holidays[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public holidays in Nauru\n\nIndependence Day is celebrated on 31 January.[145]\n\n\n\n## Public services[edit]\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in Nauru\n\nLiteracy on Nauru is 96 per cent. Education is compulsory for children from six to sixteen years old, and two more non-compulsory years are offered (years 11 and 12).[146] The island has three primary schools and two secondary schools. The secondary schools are Nauru Secondary School and Nauru College.[147] There is a campus of the University of the South Pacific on Nauru. Before this campus was built in 1987, students would study either by distance or abroad.[148] Since 2011, the University of New England, Australia has established a presence on the island with around 30 Nauruan teachers studying for an associate degree in education. These students will continue on to the degree to complete their studies.[149] This project is led by Associate Professor Pep Serow and funded by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\n\n\nThe previous community public library was destroyed in a fire. As of 1999[update] a new one had not yet been built, and no bookmobile services were available as of that year. Sites with libraries include the University of the South Pacific campus, Nauru Secondary, Kayser College, and Aiwo Primary.[150] The Nauru Community Library is in the new University of the South Pacific Nauru Campus building, which was officially opened in May 2018.\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Nauru\n\nFurther information: Obesity in Nauru\n\n![](image)Nauruan residents walking around Nauru International Airport. Nauruans are amongst the most obese people in the world.[151]Nauru has one of the highest child mortality rates in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) region at 2.9% in 2020, according to a UNICEF study.[152]\n\n\nLife expectancy in Nauru in 2009 was 60.6 years for males and 68.0 years for females.[153]\n\n\nBy measure of mean body mass index (BMI), Nauruans are the most overweight people in the world;[151] 97 per cent of men and 93 per cent of women are overweight or obese.[151] In 2012, the obesity rate was 71.7 per cent.[154] Obesity on the Pacific islands is common.\n\n\nNauru has the world's highest level of type 2 diabetes, with more than 40 per cent of the population affected.[155] Other significant dietary-related problems on Nauru include kidney disease and heart disease.[153]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of Nauru International AirportMain article: Transport in Nauru\n\nThe island is solely served by Nauru International Airport. Passenger service is provided by Nauru Airlines. Flights operate four days a week to Brisbane,[156] with limited service to other destinations including Nadi[157] and Bonriki.[158]\n\n\nNauru is accessible by sea via the Nauru International Port. The modernization and expansion project of the former Aiwo Boat Harbor was expected to be completed in 2021 but has been delayed due to technical and logistics issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[159][160]\n\n\n\n## Resources[edit]\n\n\n### Plants and Farming[edit]\n\n\nHistorically, Indigenous Nauruans kept household gardens that provided much of the food that they needed through subsistence farming, with the most common food plants including coconuts, breadfruit, bananas, pandanus, papaya, and guavas.[161] Because of the large immigrant population that would work in the phosphate mines, there were many types of fruits and vegetables grown that were staples in those countries as well.[161] The soil in Nauru was very rich on what citizens call the \"Topside,\" which is the raised phosphate plateau where the phosphate is mined from, and it was extremely fertile and great for growing crops.[161] However, the area where most Nauruans live now, on the coastal ring on the island that hasn't been mined, the soil quality is among the poorest in the world, as it is shallow, alkaline, and has the coarse texture of the coral that surrounds it.[162][161][163] In 2011, just 13% of households maintained a garden or were involved in growing crops.[164] Most of the soil that was on Nauru is now gone because of phosphate-mining activities, leaving people to import the soil that they need.[162][161] Ethnobotanical studies have indicated that the reduction in the types of plants that can be grown due to phosphate mining has significantly impacted the connection that Indigenous Nauruans feel to the land, as plants are a large part of their cultural identity and have many uses in their lives, with each plant having an average of 7 uses within Pacific Island cultures.[161]\n\n\n\n### Food[edit]\n\n\nFor Nauru residents today, all food must also be imported because of the loss of 90% of tenable land due to phosphate mining, leaving people with a diet of mainly processed foods, such as rice and sugar.[165] Though residents are trying to salvage the soil that they can, some researchers speculate that there will be no regeneration of soils even after the mining ceases.[162] The country's dependence on processed and imported foods along with \"cultural, historical and social factors\" have greatly affected the health of its citizens.[166] Despite having all food imported, the Household and Income Expenditure Survey (HIES) conducted for the year of 2012–2013 found that Nauruans have a food poverty incidence rate of 0, based on the Food Poverty Line (FPL) which \"includes a daily intake of 2,100 calories per adult per day.\"[166]\n\n\n\n### Non-food Basic Needs[edit]\n\n\nWhile the HIES found that Nauru is doing well in terms of food poverty, 24% of the population and 16.8% of households are below the basic needs (clothing, shelter, education, transport, communication, water, sanitation and health services) poverty line.[166] This is the worst poverty index of all Pacific nations.[166] In 2017, half of Nauruans were living on $9,000 a year. Water resources are extremely limited, with the island supplying enough for 32 liters of freshwater per person per day despite the WHO's recommendation of 50 liters per person per day.[167] Much of the groundwater has been contaminated by mining runoff, toilets, and dumping of other commercial and household wastes, causing Nauruans to rely on imported water, the price of which can vary as it is closely tied to fuel prices for its delivery, and rainfall storage.[167][152] Access to sanitation facilities is restricted with just 66% of residents having access to reliable toilets, and open defecation is still practiced by 3% of the population.[152] Schools are frequently forced to close because they do not have reliable toilets or drinking water for students to use.[152] There is a long-standing truancy problem and accessibility of education for refugee and asylum-seeking children, as well as for disabled children remain areas of concern for Nauru's education sector.[152]\n\n\n\n## Effects of mining on Nauruans and their land[edit]\n\n\n### Land and people[edit]\n\n\nSince the early 1900s, Nauru has been mined for phosphorus by many countries, resulting in devastating destruction of the land. As noted earlier, 80% of the island is unusable due to phosphorus mining, which has left exposed coral pinnacles that leave the land useless and uninhabitable.[167] The degradation of the land has resulted in a \"lower resilience of the natural environment,\" causing many negative health and environmental effects, like poor water quality, greater erosion rates, poor precipitation, higher droughts, and greater CO2 emissions.[167] The damage done through mining extends further by ocean acidification and coastal erosion and has threatened terrestrial and marine biodiversity.[167] The people of Nauru also face continued negative health effects from the mining in the form of phosphate dust pollution and cadmium pollution, tainting the water and air quality.[167] As a result, the rate of care-seeking for children under 5 years of age with ARI is 69% according to UNICEF data.[164] Due to the extent of the mining, there is not much that can be done now to alleviate the agricultural problems that Nauruans face besides monetary reparations, which Nauru pursued from the Australian Government in 1989 through the International Court of Justice in the Hague.[163][168] The lawsuit was settled in 1993 in an out-of-court payout of $120 million AUD over 20 years.[168]\n\n\nPhosphate mining has removed most of the vegetation and tree coverage that Nauru had, leaving the land and the people vulnerable to intense heat on an island so close to the Equator.[161] The effects of the vegetation removal has been most felt by refugees in the Nauru detention center, which is in the very center of the island where the majority of the mining is done.[169] Along the coast, where most Nauruans are forced to live now due to the land reduction caused by mining, the coastal plants that remain are vital for the \"provision of shade and animal and plant habitats; protection from wind, erosion, flood, and salt water incursion; land stabilization; protection from the desiccating effects of salt spray; and soil improvement and mulching,\" especially as the coast is expected to continue eroding with the increasing effects of climate change.[161]\n\n\n\n### Social effects[edit]\n\n\nBecause phosphate mining, and now deep-sea mining, has been going on for so long, it is hard to parse out exactly how it has affected the Nauruan people. Researchers have offered that the Nauruan people likely have a loss of their sense of place and culture, as they did not have full control of their land until 1968.[170][171] There has also been a documented loss of Nauruan traditions like subsistence farming as well as the violations of their rights to their own land and the continued human rights violations that continue at the Nauru detention center.[171] The Nauruan people face extremely high rates of obesity, alcoholism, prostitution, poorer mental health rates, and myriad other health issues that stem from these problems.[152][171] A study done in 2014 by The Nauru Family Health and Support Study implemented by Nauru Department of Home Affairs and DFAT and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) have shown the alarming prevalence of violence in romantic relationships on the island, with 48.1% of ever-partnered women who participated saying that have experienced physical or sexual violence at least once.[166] A quarter of women in the same study have experienced violence in at least one pregnancy, and 9.9% of women had experienced some form of violence in the past 12 months.[166] In another study surveying sexual health, 21% of a portion of the population tested positive for chlamydia.[164] In the same survey, 30% of school children aged 13–15 reported having attempted suicide, and 24% of children under the age of five are stunted.[164] Though Nauruans are currently still searching for a way to stay on the island and live viable lives, some speculate that the only way for them to do so is to continue mining the phosphorus that is left (30 years or so).[169]\n\n\n\n## Asylum seeker detention centre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nauru Regional Processing Centre\n\nThe Nauru Regional Processing Centre is an offshore Australian immigration detention facility established in 2001 and run by the Government of Nauru. The use of immigration detention facilities is part of a policy of mandatory detention in Australia. The detainees at the centre have suffered serious human rights abuses and there are widespread reports of suicide and psychiatric illness. In 2013, a veteran nurse described the detention centre as \"like a concentration camp\".[172] The Nauru facility was opened in 2001 as part of the Howard government's Pacific Solution.[173] As of February 2022[update] there were 115 held by Australia on Nauru, costing the Australian government more than $4m per year per asylum seeker (nearly $12,000 per day).[174]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Oceania portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* Index of Nauru-related articles\n* Outline of Nauru\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Nauru does not have an official capital but Yaren is the seat of parliament.[1]\n2. **^** English is widely spoken by the majority of the population and it is commonly used in government, legislation and commerce alongside Nauruan.

Its nearest neighbour is Banaba of Kiribati, about 300 km (190 mi) to the east.[13] It lies northwest of Tuvalu, 1,300 km (810 mi) northeast of Solomon Islands,[14] east-northeast of Papua New Guinea, southeast of the Federated States of Micronesia and south of the Marshall Islands. With an area of only 21 km2 (8.1 sq mi), Nauru is the third-smallest country in the world behind Vatican City and Monaco, making it the smallest republic and island nation. Its population of about 10,800 is the world's second-smallest (not including colonies or overseas territories) after Vatican City.\nSettled by people from Micronesia circa 1000 BCE, Nauru was annexed and claimed as a colony by the German Empire in the late 19th century. After World War I, Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. During World War II, Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops, and was bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. After the war ended, the country entered into United Nations trusteeship. Nauru gained its independence in 1968.\n\n\nNauru is a phosphate-rock island with rich deposits near the surface, which allowed easy strip mining operations for over a century. However, this has seriously harmed the country's environment, causing the island nation to suffer from what is often referred to as the \"resource curse\". The phosphate was exhausted in the 1990s, and the remaining reserves are not economically viable for extraction.[15] A trust established to manage the island's accumulated mining wealth, set up for the day the reserves would be exhausted, has diminished in value. To earn income, Nauru briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre.[16] At various points since 2001, it has accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange for hosting the Nauru Regional Processing Centre, a controversial offshore Australian immigration detention facility. As a result of heavy dependence on Australia, some sources have identified Nauru as a client state of Australia.[17][18][19] The sovereign state is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Organization of African, Caribbean, and Pacific States.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Nauru and British Western Pacific Territories\n\n![](image)Photo of a Nauruan warrior during the Nauruan Civil War around 1880\nNauru was first settled by Micronesians at least 3,000 years ago, and there is evidence of possible Polynesian influence.[20] Comparatively little is known of Nauruan prehistory,[21] although the island is believed to have had a long period of isolation, which accounts for the distinct language that developed among the inhabitants.[22] There were traditionally 12 clans or tribes on Nauru, which are represented in the twelve-pointed star on the country's flag.[23] Traditionally, Nauruans traced their descent matrilineally. Inhabitants practised aquaculture: they caught juvenile milkfish (known as *Ibija* in Nauruan), acclimatised them to freshwater, and raised them in Buada Lagoon, providing a reliable food source. The other locally grown components of their diet included coconuts and pandanus fruit.[24][25] The name \"Nauru\" may derive from the Nauruan word **Anáoero**, which means 'I go to the beach.'[26]\n\n\nIn 1798, the British sea captain John Fearn, on his trading ship *Hunter* (300 tons), became the first Westerner to report sighting Nauru, calling it \"Pleasant Island\", because of its attractive appearance.[27][28] From at least 1826, Nauruans had regular contact with Europeans on whaling and trading ships who called for provisions and fresh drinking water.[29] The last whaler to call during the age of sail visited in 1904.[30]\n\n\nAround this time, deserters from European ships began to live on the island. The islanders traded food for alcoholic palm wine and firearms.[31] The firearms were used during the 10-year Nauruan Civil War that began in 1878.[32]\n\n\nAfter an agreement with Great Britain, Nauru was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany's Marshall Islands Protectorate for administrative purposes.[33][34] The arrival of the Germans ended the civil war, and kings were established as rulers of the island. The most widely known of these was King Auweyida. Christian missionaries from the Gilbert Islands arrived in 1888.[35][36] The German settlers called the island \"Nawodo\" or \"Onawero\".[37] The Germans ruled Nauru for almost three decades. Robert Rasch, a German trader who married a Nauruan woman, was the first administrator, appointed in 1890.[35]\n\n\nPhosphate was discovered on Nauru in 1900 by the prospector Albert Fuller Ellis.[34][28] The Pacific Phosphate Company began to exploit the reserves in 1906 by agreement with Germany, exporting its first shipment in 1907.[27][38] In 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, Nauru was captured by Australian troops. In 1919, it was agreed by the Allied and Associated Powers that His Britannic Majesty should be the administering authority under a League of Nations mandate. The Nauru Island Agreement forged in 1919 between the governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand provided for the administration of the island and extraction of the phosphate deposits by an intergovernmental British Phosphate Commission (BPC).[33][39] The terms of the League of Nations mandate were drawn up in 1920.[33][40]\n\n\nThe island experienced an influenza epidemic and ongoing colonial strife through the early 20th century, with a mortality rate of 18 per cent among native Nauruans.[41] In 1923, the League of Nations gave Australia a trustee mandate over Nauru, with the United Kingdom and New Zealand as co-trustees.[42] On 6 and 7 December 1940, the German auxiliary cruisers *Komet* and *Orion* sank five supply ships in the vicinity of Nauru. *Komet* then shelled Nauru's phosphate mining areas, oil storage depots, and the shiploading cantilever.[43][44][45]\n\n\n\n![](image)U.S. Army Air Forces bombing the Japanese airstrip on Nauru, 1943.[46]\nJapanese troops occupied Nauru on 25 August 1942.[44] The Japanese built 2 airfields which were bombed for the first time on 25 March 1943, preventing food supplies from being flown to Nauru.[47] The Japanese deported 1,200 Nauruans to work as labourers in the Chuuk Islands,[46] which was also occupied by Japan. As part of the Allied strategy of island hopping from the Pacific islands towards the main islands of Japan, Nauru was bypassed and left to \"wither on the vine\". Nauru was finally taken back from the Japanese on 13 September 1945, when commander Hisayaki Soeda surrendered the island to the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy.[48] The surrender was accepted by Brigadier J. R. Stevenson, who represented Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee, the commander of the First Australian Army, aboard the warship HMAS *Diamantina*.[49][50][51] Arrangements were made to repatriate from Chuuk the 745 Nauruans who survived Japanese captivity there.[52] They were returned to Nauru by the BPC ship *Trienza* in January 1946.[53]\n\n\nIn 1947, a trusteeship was established by the United Nations, with Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as trustees.[54][55] Under those arrangements, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand were a joint administering authority. The Nauru Island Agreement provided for the first administrator to be appointed by Australia for five years, leaving subsequent appointments to be decided by the three governments.[33][40] However, in practice, administrative power was exercised by Australia alone.[33][40]\n\n\nThe 1948 Nauru riots occurred when Chinese guano mining workers went on strike over pay and conditions. The Australian administration imposed a state of emergency with Native Police and armed volunteers of locals and Australian officials being mobilised. This force, using sub-machine guns and other firearms, opened fire on the Chinese workers killing two and wounding sixteen. Around 50 of the workers were arrested and two of these were bayoneted to death while in custody. The trooper who bayoneted the prisoners was charged but later acquitted on grounds that the wounds were \"accidentally received.\"[56][57] The governments of the Soviet Union and China made official complaints against Australia at the United Nations over this incident.[58]\n\n\nIn 1964, it was proposed to relocate the population of Nauru to Curtis Island off the coast of Queensland, Australia. By that time, Nauru had been extensively mined for phosphate by companies from Australia, Britain, and New Zealand, damaging the landscape so much that it was thought the island would be uninhabitable by the 1990s. Rehabilitating the island was seen as financially impossible. In 1962, Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies said that the three countries involved in the mining had an obligation to provide a solution for the Nauruan people, and proposed finding a new island for them. In 1963, the Australian Government proposed to acquire all the land on Curtis Island (which was considerably larger than Nauru) and then offer the Nauruans freehold title over the island and that the Nauruans would become Australian citizens.[59][60] The cost of resettling the Nauruans on Curtis Island was estimated to be £10 million (A$324 million in 2022[61]), which included housing and infrastructure and the establishment of pastoral, agricultural, and fishing industries.[62] However, the Nauruan people did not wish to become Australian citizens and wanted to be given sovereignty over Curtis Island to establish themselves as an independent nation, which Australia would not agree to.[63] Nauru rejected the proposal to move to Curtis Island, instead choosing to become an independent nation operating their mines in Nauru.[64]\n\n\nNauru became self-governing in January 1966, and following a two-year constitutional convention, it became independent on 31 January 1968 under founding president Hammer DeRoburt.[65] In 1967, the people of Nauru purchased the assets of the British Phosphate Commissioners, and in June 1970, control passed to the locally owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation (NPC).[38] Income from the mines made Nauruans among the richest people in the world.[66][67] In 1989, Nauru took legal action against Australia in the International Court of Justice over Australia's administration of the island, in particular, Australia's failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by phosphate mining. *Certain Phosphate Lands: Nauru v. Australia* led to an out-of-court settlement to rehabilitate the mined-out areas of Nauru.[54][68]\n\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a state of emergency was declared in Nauru on 17 March 2020. The declaration to minimize the outbreak was signed by President Lionel Aingimea during a period of 30 days.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Nauru and Geology of Nauru\n\n![](image)Map of Nauru\nNauru is a 21 km2 (8.1 sq mi),[3] oval-shaped island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, 55.95 km (34.77 mi) south of the Equator.[69] The island is surrounded by a coral reef, which is exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles.[4] The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a seaport, although channels in the reef allow small boats access to the island.[70] A fertile coastal strip 150 to 300 m (490 to 980 ft) wide lies inland from the beach.[4]\n\n\nCoral cliffs surround Nauru's central plateau. The highest point of the plateau, called the Command Ridge, is 71 m (233 ft) above sea level.[71]\n\n\nThe only fertile areas on Nauru are on the narrow coastal belt, where coconut palms flourish. The land around Buada Lagoon supports bananas, pineapples, vegetables, pandanus trees, and indigenous hardwoods, such as the tamanu tree.[4]\n\n\nNauru was one of three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean, along with Banaba (Ocean Island), in Kiribati, and Makatea, in French Polynesia. The phosphate reserves on Nauru are now almost entirely depleted. Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to 15 m (49 ft) high. Mining has stripped and devastated about 80 per cent of Nauru's land area, leaving it uninhabitable[67] and has also affected the surrounding exclusive economic zone; 40 per cent of marine life is estimated to have been killed by silt and phosphate runoff.[4][72]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nNauru's climate is hot and very humid year-round because of its proximity to the equator and the ocean. Nauru is hit by monsoon rains between November and February. Annual rainfall is highly variable and is influenced by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, with several significant recorded droughts.[20][73] The temperature on Nauru ranges between 30 and 35 °C (86 and 95 °F) during the day and is quite stable at around 25 °C (77 °F) at night.[74]\n\n\nStreams and rivers do not exist in Nauru. Water is gathered from roof catchment systems. Water is brought to Nauru as ballast on ships returning for loads of phosphate.[75]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Yaren District, Nauru\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 34(93)\n | 37(99)\n | 35(95)\n | 35(95)\n | 32(90)\n | 32(90)\n | 35(95)\n | 33(91)\n | 35(95)\n | 34(93)\n | 36(97)\n | 35(95)\n | 37(99)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 31(88)\n | 31(88)\n | 31(88)\n | 30(87)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 280(11.0)\n | 250(9.8)\n | 190(7.5)\n | 190(7.5)\n | 120(4.7)\n | 110(4.3)\n | 150(5.9)\n | 130(5.1)\n | 120(4.7)\n | 100(3.9)\n | 120(4.7)\n | 280(11.0)\n | 2,080(81.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation days\n | 16\n | 14\n | 13\n | 11\n | 9\n | 9\n | 12\n | 14\n | 11\n | 10\n | 13\n | 15\n | 152\n |\n| Source: Weatherbase |\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Nauru\n### Ecology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eastern Micronesia tropical moist forests and List of mammals of Nauru\n\nFauna is sparse on the island because of a lack of vegetation and the consequences of phosphate mining. Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to the destruction of their habitat.[76] There are about 60 recorded vascular plant species native to the island, none of which are endemic. Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have seriously disturbed the native vegetation.[20]\n\n\nThere are no native land mammals, but there are native insects, land crabs, and birds, including the endemic Nauru reed warbler. The Polynesian rat, cats, dogs, pigs, and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships.[77] The diversity of the reef marine life makes fishing a popular activity for tourists on the island; also popular are scuba diving and snorkelling.[78]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Nauru and Elections in Nauru\n\nFurther information: Law of Nauru, List of political parties in Nauru, and Crime in Nauru\n\n![](image)Parliament of Nauru\nThe president of Nauru is David Adeang, who heads a 19-member unicameral parliament. The country is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Asian Development Bank. Nauru also participates in the Commonwealth and Olympic Games. Recently Nauru became a member country of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The Republic of Nauru became the 189th member of the International Monetary Fund in April 2016.\n\n\nNauru is a republic with a parliamentary system of government.[65] The president is both head of state and head of government and is dependent on parliamentary confidence to remain president. All 19 parliament seats are elected every three years.[79] The parliament elects the president from its members, and the president appoints a cabinet of five to six members.[80] As a result of a referendum in 2021, naturalised citizens and their descendants are barred from becoming parliamentarians.\n\n\nNauru does not have any formal structure for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19 members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed based on extended family ties rather than party affiliation.[81]\n\n\nFrom 1992 to 1999, Nauru had a local government system known as the Nauru Island Council (NIC).[82] It was a successor to the Nauru Local Government Council, established in 1951.[83] This nine-member council was designed to provide municipal services. The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government.[82] Land tenure on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, which is owned by individuals and family groups. Government and corporate entities do not own any land, and they must enter into a lease arrangement with landowners to use land. Non-Nauruans cannot own land on the island.[20]\n\n\nNauru's Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice, is paramount on constitutional issues. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions. Historically, Appellate Court rulings could be appealed to the High Court of Australia,[84][85] though this happened only rarely and the Australian court's appellate jurisdiction ended entirely on 12 March 2018 after the Government of Nauru unilaterally ended the arrangement.[86][87][88] Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. There are two other quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.[4]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Nauru\n\nFollowing independence in 1968, Nauru joined the Commonwealth of Nations as a Special Member; it became a full member in 1999.[89] The country was admitted to the Asian Development Bank in 1991 and the United Nations in 1999.[90] Nauru is a member of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme, the Pacific Community, and the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission.[91] In February 2021, Nauru announced it would be formally withdrawing from the Pacific Islands Forum in a joint statement with Marshall Islands, Kiribati, and the Federated States of Micronesia after a dispute regarding Henry Puna's election as the Forum's secretary-general.[92][93]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nauruan police cadets undergoing training. Nauru has no armed forces, though there is a small police force under civilian control.\nNauru has no armed forces, though there is a small police force under civilian control.[3] Australia is responsible for Nauru's defence under an informal agreement between the two countries.[3] The September 2005 memorandum of understanding between Australia and Nauru provides the latter with financial aid and technical assistance, including a Secretary of Finance to prepare the budget, and advisers on health and education. This aid is in return for Nauru's housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed.[94] Nauru uses the Australian dollar as its official currency.[4]\n\n\nNauru has used its position as a member of the United Nations to gain financial support from both Taiwan (officially the Republic of China or ROC) and mainland China (officially the People's Republic of China or PRC) by changing its recognition from one to the other under the One-China policy. On 21 July 2002, Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC, accepting US$130 million from the PRC for this action[95] (US$211 million in 2023[96]). In response, the ROC severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later. Nauru later re-established links with the ROC on 14 May 2005,[97] and diplomatic ties with the PRC were officially severed on 31 May 2005.[98]\n\n\nIn 2008, Nauru recognised Kosovo as an independent country, and in 2009 Nauru became the fourth country, after Russia, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, to recognise Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia. Russia was reported to be giving Nauru US$50 million in humanitarian aid as a result of this recognition[95] ($69.5 million in 2023[96]). On 15 July 2008, the Nauruan government announced a port refurbishment programme, financed with US$9 million of development aid received from Russia ($12.5 million in 2023[96]). The Nauru government claimed this aid is not related to its recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.[99]\n\n\nA significant portion of Nauru's income has been in the form of aid from Australia. In 2001, the MV *Tampa*, a Norwegian ship that had rescued 438 refugees from a stranded 20-metre-long boat, was seeking to dock in Australia. In what became known as the *Tampa* affair, the ship was refused entry and boarded by Australian troops. The refugees were eventually loaded onto Royal Australian Navy vessel HMAS *Manoora* and taken to Nauru to be held in detention facilities which later became part of the Howard government's Pacific Solution. Nauru operated two detention centres known as State House and Topside for these refugees in exchange for Australian aid.[100] By November 2005, only two refugees, Mohammed Sagar and Muhammad Faisal remained on Nauru from those first sent there in 2001,[101] with Sagar finally resettling in early 2007. The Australian government sent further groups of asylum-seekers to Nauru in late 2006 and early 2007.[102] The refugee centre was closed in 2008,[4] but, following the Australian government's re-adoption of the Pacific Solution in August 2012, it has re-opened it.[103] The US Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program operates a climate-monitoring facility on the island.[104]\n\n\nIn March 2017, at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council, Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of Nauru and some other Pacific nations raising human rights violations in Western New Guinea, which has been occupied by Indonesia since 1963,[105] and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report.[106][107] Indonesia rejected the allegations.[107] More than 100,000 Papuans have died during a 50-year Papua conflict.[108]\n\n\nAmnesty International has since described the conditions of the refugees of war living in Nauru as a \"horror\",[109][110] with reports of children as young as eight attempting suicide and engaging in acts of self-harm.[111] In 2018, the situation gained attention as a \"mental health crisis\", with an estimated thirty children suffering from traumatic withdrawal syndrome, also known as resignation syndrome.[111][112]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of settlements in Nauru\n\n![](image)Map of Nauru showing its districts\nNauru is divided into fourteen administrative districts, which are grouped into eight electoral constituencies and are further divided into villages.[4][3] The most populous district is Denigomodu, with 1,804 residents, of which 1,497 reside in an RONPhos settlement called \"Location\". The following table shows population by district according to the 2011 census.[113]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| No. | District | Formername | Area(ha) | Population(2011) | No. ofvillages | Density(persons/ha)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Aiwo | Aiue | 110 | 1,220 | 8 | 11.1\n |\n| 2 | Anabar | Anebwor | 150 | 452 | 15 | 3.0\n |\n| 3 | Anetan | Añetañ | 100 | 587 | 12 | 5.9\n |\n| 4 | Anibare | Anybody | 310 | 226 | 17 | 0.7\n |\n| 5 | Baitsi | Beidi, Baiti | 120 | 513 | 15 | 4.3\n |\n| 6 | Boe | Boi | 50 | 851 | 4 | 17.0\n |\n| 7 | Buada | Arenibok | 260 | 739 | 14 | 2.8\n |\n| 8 | Denigomodu | Denikomotu | 118 | 1,804 | 17 | 15.3\n |\n| 9 | Ewa | Eoa | 120 | 446 | 12 | 3.7\n |\n| 10 | Ijuw | Ijub | 110 | 178 | 13 | 1.6\n |\n| 11 | Meneng | Meneñ | 310 | 1,380 | 18 | 4.5\n |\n| 12 | Nibok | Ennibeck | 160 | 484 | 11 | 3.0\n |\n| 13 | Uaboe | Ueboi | 80 | 318 | 6 | 3.0\n |\n| 14 | Yaren | Moqua | 150 | 747 | 7 | 4.0\n |\n| – | **Nauru** | Naoero | 2,120 | 10,084 | 169 | 4.8\n |\n\n |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Nauru and Telecommunications in Nauru\n\n![](image)A satellite image of Nauru, 2002\nBefore a resurgence in the 2010s, the Nauruan economy was strongest in the 1970s, with GDP peaking in 1981.[114][115] This trend came from phosphate mining, which accounted for a majority of its economic output. Mining declined starting in the early 1980s.[116]: 5 There are few other resources, and most necessities are imported.[4][117] Small-scale mining is still conducted by RONPhos, formerly known as the Nauru Phosphate Corporation.[4] The government places a percentage of RONPhos's earnings into the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. The trust manages long-term investments, which were intended to support the citizens after the phosphate reserves were exhausted.[118]\n\n\nBecause of mismanagement, the trust's fixed and current assets were reduced considerably and may never fully recover. The failed investments included financing *Leonardo the Musical* in 1993.[119] The Mercure Hotel in Sydney[120] and Nauru House in Melbourne were sold in 2004 to finance debts and Air Nauru's only Boeing 737 was repossessed in December 2005. Normal air service resumed after the aircraft was replaced with a Boeing 737-300 airliner in June 2006.[121] In 2005, the corporation sold its remaining real estate in Melbourne, the vacant Savoy Tavern site, for $7.5 million[122] (US$11.2 million in 2023[96]).\n\n\nThe value of the trust is estimated to have shrunk from A$1.3 billion in 1991 to A$138 million in 2002 (A$2.79 billion to A$229 million in 2022 dollars[61]).[123] Nauru currently lacks money to perform many of the basic functions of government; for example, the National Bank of Nauru is insolvent. The CIA World Factbook estimated a GDP per capita of US$5,000 in 2005.[3] The Asian Development Bank 2007 economic report on Nauru estimated GDP per capita at US$2,400 to US$2,715.[116]\n\n\nThere are no personal taxes in Nauru. The unemployment rate is estimated to be 23 per cent and the government employs 95 per cent of those who have jobs.[3][124] The Asian Development Bank notes that, although the administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms, in the absence of an alternative to phosphate mining, the medium-term outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance.[123] Tourism is not a major contributor to the economy.[125]\n\n\n\n![](image)Limestone pinnacles remain after phosphate mining at the site of one of Nauru's secondary mines\nIn the 1990s, Nauru became a tax haven and offered passports to foreign nationals for a fee.[126] The inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) identified Nauru as one of 15 \"non-cooperative\" countries in its fight against money laundering. During the 1990s, it was possible to establish a licensed bank in Nauru for only US$25,000[126] (US$42,040 in 2023[96]) with no other requirements. Under pressure from FATF, Nauru introduced anti-avoidance legislation in 2003, after which foreign hot money left the country. In October 2005, after satisfactory results from the legislation and its enforcement, FATF lifted the non-cooperative designation.[127]\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007, the Nauru detention centre provided a significant source of income for the country. The Nauruan authorities reacted with concern to its closure by Australia.[128] In February 2008, the Foreign Affairs minister, Kieren Keke, stated that the closure would result in 100 Nauruans losing their jobs, and would affect 10 per cent of the island's population directly or indirectly: \"We have got a huge number of families that are suddenly going to be without any income. We are looking at ways we can try and provide some welfare assistance but our capacity to do that is very limited. Literally we have got a major unemployment crisis in front of us.\"[129] The detention centre was re-opened in August 2012.[103]\n\n\nIn July 2017 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) upgraded its rating of Nauru's standards of tax transparency. Previously Nauru had been listed alongside fourteen other countries that had failed to show that they could comply with international tax transparency standards and regulations. The OECD subsequently put Nauru through a fast-tracked compliance process and the country was given a \"largely compliant\" rating.[130]\n\n\nThe Nauru 2017–2018 budget, delivered by Minister of Finance David Adeang, forecast A$128.7 million in revenues and A$128.6 million in expenditures and projected modest economic growth for the nation over the next two years.[131] In 2018 the Nauru government partnered with the deep sea mining company DeepGreen, now Nauru Ocean Resources Inc (NORI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canadian The Metals Company.[132] They planned to harvest manganese nodules whose minerals and metals can be used in the development of sustainable energy technology.[133][134][135]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Nauru\n\n![Demographic pyramid of Nauru, 2015](image)\nNauru had 12,511 residents as of July 2021.[6][7] The population was previously larger, but in 2006 the island saw 1,500 people leave during a repatriation of immigrant workers from Kiribati and Tuvalu. The repatriation was motivated by significant layoffs in phosphate mining.[116]\n\n\nNauru is one of the most densely populated Westernized countries in the South Pacific.[136]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFifty-eight per cent of people in Nauru are ethnically Nauruan, 26 per cent are other Pacific Islander, 8 per cent are European, and 8 per cent are Han Chinese.[3]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nauruan language\n\nThe official languages of Nauru are Nauruan and English. Nauruan[1] is a distinct Micronesian language, which is spoken by 96 per cent of ethnic Nauruans at home.[116] English is widely spoken and is the language of government and commerce.[3][4]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Religion in Nauru\n\n![](image)Church in Nauru\nThe main religion practised on the island is Christianity (the main denominations are Nauru Congregational Church 35.71%, Roman Catholic 32.96%, Assemblies of God 12.98%, and Baptist 1.48%).[4] The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. The government has restricted the religious practices of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Jehovah's Witnesses, most of whom are foreign workers employed by the government-owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation.[137] The Catholics are pastorally served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarawa and Nauru, with see at Tarawa in Kiribati.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of Nauru, Music of Nauru, and Nauruan cuisine\n\nAngam Day, held on 26 October, celebrates the recovery of the Nauruan population after the two world wars and the 1920 influenza epidemic.[138] Colonial and contemporary Western influence has largely displaced the indigenous culture.[139] Few older customs have been preserved, but some forms of traditional music, arts and crafts, and fishing are still practised.[140]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mass media in Nauru\n\nThere are no daily news publications on Nauru, although there is one fortnightly publication, *Mwinen Ko*. There is a state-owned television station, Nauru Television (NTV), which broadcasts programs from New Zealand and Australia, and a state-owned non-commercial radio station, Radio Nauru, which carries programs from Radio Australia and the BBC.[141]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Soccer in Nauru\n\n![](image)Australian rules football, played at Linkbelt Oval\nAustralian rules football is the most popular sport in Nauru; it and weightlifting are considered the country's national sports. There is an Australian rules football league with eight teams.[142] The Nauruan national team for Australian rules football are the Chiefs. Other sports popular in Nauru include volleyball, netball, fishing, weightlifting and tennis. Nauru participates in the Commonwealth Games and has participated in the Summer Olympic Games in weightlifting and judo.[143]\n\n\nNauru's national basketball team competed at the 1969 Pacific Games, where it defeated Solomon Islands and Fiji.\n\n\nThe Nauru national rugby sevens team made its international debut at the 2015 Pacific Games.[144]\n\n\nNauru competed in the 2015 Oceania Sevens Championship in New Zealand.\n\n\n\n### Holidays[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public holidays in Nauru\n\nIndependence Day is celebrated on 31 January.[145]\n\n\n\n## Public services[edit]\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in Nauru\n\nLiteracy on Nauru is 96 per cent. Education is compulsory for children from six to sixteen years old, and two more non-compulsory years are offered (years 11 and 12).[146] The island has three primary schools and two secondary schools. The secondary schools are Nauru Secondary School and Nauru College.[147] There is a campus of the University of the South Pacific on Nauru. Before this campus was built in 1987, students would study either by distance or abroad.[148] Since 2011, the University of New England, Australia has established a presence on the island with around 30 Nauruan teachers studying for an associate degree in education. These students will continue on to the degree to complete their studies.[149] This project is led by Associate Professor Pep Serow and funded by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\n\n\nThe previous community public library was destroyed in a fire. As of 1999[update] a new one had not yet been built, and no bookmobile services were available as of that year. Sites with libraries include the University of the South Pacific campus, Nauru Secondary, Kayser College, and Aiwo Primary.[150] The Nauru Community Library is in the new University of the South Pacific Nauru Campus building, which was officially opened in May 2018.\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Nauru\n\nFurther information: Obesity in Nauru\n\n![](image)Nauruan residents walking around Nauru International Airport. Nauruans are amongst the most obese people in the world.[151]Nauru has one of the highest child mortality rates in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) region at 2.9% in 2020, according to a UNICEF study.[152]\n\n\nLife expectancy in Nauru in 2009 was 60.6 years for males and 68.0 years for females.[153]\n\n\nBy measure of mean body mass index (BMI), Nauruans are the most overweight people in the world;[151] 97 per cent of men and 93 per cent of women are overweight or obese.[151] In 2012, the obesity rate was 71.7 per cent.[154] Obesity on the Pacific islands is common.\n\n\nNauru has the world's highest level of type 2 diabetes, with more than 40 per cent of the population affected.[155] Other significant dietary-related problems on Nauru include kidney disease and heart disease.[153]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of Nauru International AirportMain article: Transport in Nauru\n\nThe island is solely served by Nauru International Airport. Passenger service is provided by Nauru Airlines. Flights operate four days a week to Brisbane,[156] with limited service to other destinations including Nadi[157] and Bonriki.[158]\n\n\nNauru is accessible by sea via the Nauru International Port. The modernization and expansion project of the former Aiwo Boat Harbor was expected to be completed in 2021 but has been delayed due to technical and logistics issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[159][160]\n\n\n\n## Resources[edit]\n\n\n### Plants and Farming[edit]\n\n\nHistorically, Indigenous Nauruans kept household gardens that provided much of the food that they needed through subsistence farming, with the most common food plants including coconuts, breadfruit, bananas, pandanus, papaya, and guavas.[161] Because of the large immigrant population that would work in the phosphate mines, there were many types of fruits and vegetables grown that were staples in those countries as well.[161] The soil in Nauru was very rich on what citizens call the \"Topside,\" which is the raised phosphate plateau where the phosphate is mined from, and it was extremely fertile and great for growing crops.[161] However, the area where most Nauruans live now, on the coastal ring on the island that hasn't been mined, the soil quality is among the poorest in the world, as it is shallow, alkaline, and has the coarse texture of the coral that surrounds it.[162][161][163] In 2011, just 13% of households maintained a garden or were involved in growing crops.[164] Most of the soil that was on Nauru is now gone because of phosphate-mining activities, leaving people to import the soil that they need.[162][161] Ethnobotanical studies have indicated that the reduction in the types of plants that can be grown due to phosphate mining has significantly impacted the connection that Indigenous Nauruans feel to the land, as plants are a large part of their cultural identity and have many uses in their lives, with each plant having an average of 7 uses within Pacific Island cultures.[161]\n\n\n\n### Food[edit]\n\n\nFor Nauru residents today, all food must also be imported because of the loss of 90% of tenable land due to phosphate mining, leaving people with a diet of mainly processed foods, such as rice and sugar.[165] Though residents are trying to salvage the soil that they can, some researchers speculate that there will be no regeneration of soils even after the mining ceases.[162] The country's dependence on processed and imported foods along with \"cultural, historical and social factors\" have greatly affected the health of its citizens.[166] Despite having all food imported, the Household and Income Expenditure Survey (HIES) conducted for the year of 2012–2013 found that Nauruans have a food poverty incidence rate of 0, based on the Food Poverty Line (FPL) which \"includes a daily intake of 2,100 calories per adult per day.\"[166]\n\n\n\n### Non-food Basic Needs[edit]\n\n\nWhile the HIES found that Nauru is doing well in terms of food poverty, 24% of the population and 16.8% of households are below the basic needs (clothing, shelter, education, transport, communication, water, sanitation and health services) poverty line.[166] This is the worst poverty index of all Pacific nations.[166] In 2017, half of Nauruans were living on $9,000 a year. Water resources are extremely limited, with the island supplying enough for 32 liters of freshwater per person per day despite the WHO's recommendation of 50 liters per person per day.[167] Much of the groundwater has been contaminated by mining runoff, toilets, and dumping of other commercial and household wastes, causing Nauruans to rely on imported water, the price of which can vary as it is closely tied to fuel prices for its delivery, and rainfall storage.[167][152] Access to sanitation facilities is restricted with just 66% of residents having access to reliable toilets, and open defecation is still practiced by 3% of the population.[152] Schools are frequently forced to close because they do not have reliable toilets or drinking water for students to use.[152] There is a long-standing truancy problem and accessibility of education for refugee and asylum-seeking children, as well as for disabled children remain areas of concern for Nauru's education sector.[152]\n\n\n\n## Effects of mining on Nauruans and their land[edit]\n\n\n### Land and people[edit]\n\n\nSince the early 1900s, Nauru has been mined for phosphorus by many countries, resulting in devastating destruction of the land. As noted earlier, 80% of the island is unusable due to phosphorus mining, which has left exposed coral pinnacles that leave the land useless and uninhabitable.[167] The degradation of the land has resulted in a \"lower resilience of the natural environment,\" causing many negative health and environmental effects, like poor water quality, greater erosion rates, poor precipitation, higher droughts, and greater CO2 emissions.[167] The damage done through mining extends further by ocean acidification and coastal erosion and has threatened terrestrial and marine biodiversity.[167] The people of Nauru also face continued negative health effects from the mining in the form of phosphate dust pollution and cadmium pollution, tainting the water and air quality.[167] As a result, the rate of care-seeking for children under 5 years of age with ARI is 69% according to UNICEF data.[164] Due to the extent of the mining, there is not much that can be done now to alleviate the agricultural problems that Nauruans face besides monetary reparations, which Nauru pursued from the Australian Government in 1989 through the International Court of Justice in the Hague.[163][168] The lawsuit was settled in 1993 in an out-of-court payout of $120 million AUD over 20 years.[168]\n\n\nPhosphate mining has removed most of the vegetation and tree coverage that Nauru had, leaving the land and the people vulnerable to intense heat on an island so close to the Equator.[161] The effects of the vegetation removal has been most felt by refugees in the Nauru detention center, which is in the very center of the island where the majority of the mining is done.[169] Along the coast, where most Nauruans are forced to live now due to the land reduction caused by mining, the coastal plants that remain are vital for the \"provision of shade and animal and plant habitats; protection from wind, erosion, flood, and salt water incursion; land stabilization; protection from the desiccating effects of salt spray; and soil improvement and mulching,\" especially as the coast is expected to continue eroding with the increasing effects of climate change.[161]\n\n\n\n### Social effects[edit]\n\n\nBecause phosphate mining, and now deep-sea mining, has been going on for so long, it is hard to parse out exactly how it has affected the Nauruan people. Researchers have offered that the Nauruan people likely have a loss of their sense of place and culture, as they did not have full control of their land until 1968.[170][171] There has also been a documented loss of Nauruan traditions like subsistence farming as well as the violations of their rights to their own land and the continued human rights violations that continue at the Nauru detention center.[171] The Nauruan people face extremely high rates of obesity, alcoholism, prostitution, poorer mental health rates, and myriad other health issues that stem from these problems.[152][171] A study done in 2014 by The Nauru Family Health and Support Study implemented by Nauru Department of Home Affairs and DFAT and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) have shown the alarming prevalence of violence in romantic relationships on the island, with 48.1% of ever-partnered women who participated saying that have experienced physical or sexual violence at least once.[166] A quarter of women in the same study have experienced violence in at least one pregnancy, and 9.9% of women had experienced some form of violence in the past 12 months.[166] In another study surveying sexual health, 21% of a portion of the population tested positive for chlamydia.[164] In the same survey, 30% of school children aged 13–15 reported having attempted suicide, and 24% of children under the age of five are stunted.[164] Though Nauruans are currently still searching for a way to stay on the island and live viable lives, some speculate that the only way for them to do so is to continue mining the phosphorus that is left (30 years or so).[169]\n\n\n\n## Asylum seeker detention centre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nauru Regional Processing Centre\n\nThe Nauru Regional Processing Centre is an offshore Australian immigration detention facility established in 2001 and run by the Government of Nauru. The use of immigration detention facilities is part of a policy of mandatory detention in Australia. The detainees at the centre have suffered serious human rights abuses and there are widespread reports of suicide and psychiatric illness. In 2013, a veteran nurse described the detention centre as \"like a concentration camp\".[172] The Nauru facility was opened in 2001 as part of the Howard government's Pacific Solution.[173] As of February 2022[update] there were 115 held by Australia on Nauru, costing the Australian government more than $4m per year per asylum seeker (nearly $12,000 per day).[174]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Oceania portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* Index of Nauru-related articles\n* Outline of Nauru\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Nauru does not have an official capital but Yaren is the seat of parliament.[1]\n2. **^** English is widely spoken by the majority of the population and it is commonly used in government, legislation and commerce alongside Nauruan.

The nearest airport is also in Italy. The country's capital city, the City of San Marino, is located atop Monte Titano, while its largest settlement is Dogana within the largest municipality of Serravalle. San Marino's official language is Italian.\n\n\nThe country derives its name from Saint Marinus, a stonemason from the then-Roman island of Rab in present-day Croatia. Born in AD 275, Marinus participated in the rebuilding of Rimini's city walls after their destruction by Liburnian pirates. Marinus then went on to found an independently ruled monastic community on Monte Titano in AD 301; thus, San Marino lays claim to being the oldest extant sovereign state, as well as the oldest constitutional republic.[12]\n\n\nUniquely, San Marino's constitution dictates that its democratically elected legislature, the Grand and General Council, must elect two heads of state every six months. Known as captains regent, the two heads of state serve concurrently and with equal powers until their term expires after six months.\n\n\nThe country's economy is mainly based on finance, industry, services, retail, and tourism. It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world in GDP per capita, with a figure comparable to the most developed European regions.[1] Despite this fact, ranking 44th, its Human Development Index score is the lowest in Western Europe.[6] Its health care system ranked 3rd in the first ever World Health Organization analysis of the world's health systems.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of San Marino\n\n![](image)Illustration of Saint Marinus, the founder of the Republic of San Marino and prominent cultural figure\nSaint Marinus left the island of Rab in present-day Croatia with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of Rimini as a stonemason. After the Diocletianic Persecution following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby Monte Titano, where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino.\n\n\nThe official founding date is 3 September 301 AD.[14] In 1291 San Marino appealed to the bishop of Arezzo, Ildebrandino Guidi di Romena, against the contribution demands by the Vicario del Montefeltro. Jurist Palamede di Rimini, decided in favour of San Marino and recognised its tax exemption from tributes demands of Montefeltro. In 1296, when Guglielmo Durante was the governor of Romagna, Sammarinesi appealed to Pope Boniface VIII against the further requests by the Montefeltro podestas regarding tributes. Abbot Ranieri di Sant'Anastasio was assigned to judge the dispute. A long process was held using various witnesses and sources to determine San Marino tax's exemption status. The verdict was probably in favour of the autonomy of San Marino, as later the State has never paid taxes to the Montefeltro.[15]\n\n\nIn 1320, the community of Chiesanuova chose to join the country.[16] In 1463, San Marino was enlarged to include the communities of Faetano, Fiorentino, Montegiardino, and Serravalle, since then the country's borders have remained unchanged.[17]\n\n\nIn 1503, Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, occupied the Republic for six months until his father's successor, Pope Julius II, intervened and restored the country's independence.[18]\n\n\nOn 4 June 1543, Fabiano di Monte San Savino, nephew of the later Pope Julius III, attempted to conquer the republic, but his infantry and cavalry failed as they got lost in a dense fog, which the Sammarinese attributed to Saint Quirinus, whose feast day it was.[19]\n\n\nAfter the Duchy of Urbino was annexed by the Papal States in 1625, San Marino became an enclave within the papal states. This led to its seeking the formal protection of the Papal States in 1631, but this never amounted to a *de facto* Papal control of the republic.[20]\n\n\nThe country was occupied on 17 October 1739 by the legate (Papal governor) of Ravenna, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, but independence was restored by Pope Clement XII on 5 February 1740, the feast day of Saint Agatha, after which she became a patron saint of the republic.[21]\n\n\nThe advance of Napoleon's army in 1797 presented a brief threat to the independence of San Marino, but the country was saved from losing its liberty by one of its regents, Antonio Onofri, who managed to gain the respect and friendship of Napoleon. Due to Onofri's intervention, Napoleon promised, in a letter to Gaspard Monge, scientist and commissary of the French Government for Science and Art, to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic, even offering to extend its territory according to its needs. The offer was declined by the regents, fearing future retaliation from other states' revanchism.[22][23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anita and Giuseppe Garibaldi in San Marino, 1849\n![](image)The San Marino constitution, or more precisely statutes, of 1600\nDuring the later phase of the Italian unification process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification, including Giuseppe Garibaldi and his wife Anita. Garibaldi allowed San Marino to remain independent. San Marino and the Kingdom of Italy signed a Convention of Friendship in 1862.[24]\n\n\nThe government of San Marino made United States President Abraham Lincoln an honorary citizen. He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that \"government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring\".[25][26]\n\n\n\n### 20th century onwards[edit]\n\n\nDuring World War I, when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 24 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of Carabinieri in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not acquiesce. Two groups of ten volunteers joined the Italian forces in the fighting on the Italian front, the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.[27]\n\n\nAfter the war, San Marino suffered from high rates of unemployment and inflation, leading to increased tension between the lower and middle classes. The latter, fearing that the moderate government of San Marino would make concessions to the lower class majority, began to show support for the Sammarinese Fascist Party (*Partito Fascista Sammarinese*, PFS), founded in 1922 and styled largely on their Italian counterpart. PFS rule lasted from 1923 to 1943, and during this time they often sought support from Benito Mussolini's fascist government in Italy.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)British troops at Monte Titano during the Battle of San Marino, September 1944\nDuring World War II, San Marino remained neutral, although it was wrongly reported in an article in *The New York Times* that it had declared war on the United Kingdom on 17 September 1940.[29] The Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that they had not declared war on the United Kingdom.[30]\n\n\nOn 28 July 1943, three days after the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, PFS rule collapsed and the new government declared neutrality in the conflict. The PFS regained power on 1 April 1944, but kept neutrality intact. Despite that, on 26 June 1944, San Marino was bombed by the Royal Air Force, in the belief that San Marino had been overrun by German forces and was being used to amass stores and ammunition. The Sammarinese government declared on the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter.[31] San Marino accepted thousands of civilian refugees when Allied forces went over the Gothic Line.[32] In September 1944, it was briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by Allied forces in the Battle of San Marino.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSan Marino had the world's first democratically elected communist government – a coalition between the Sammarinese Communist Party and the Sammarinese Socialist Party, which held office between 1945 and 1957.[33][34] The coalition lost power through the fatti di Rovereta.\n\n\nSan Marino became a member of the Council of Europe in 1988 and of the United Nations in 1992. It is not a member of the European Union, although it uses the euro as its currency (despite not legally being part of the Eurozone). Before the introduction of the euro, the country's currency was the Sammarinese lira.\n\n\nAs of June 2020, San Marino had the highest death rate per capita of any country, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[35] In April 2021, it was reported that San Marino was using the Russian Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine rather than vaccines approved by the EU, following a slow rollout for the latter vaccines.[36][37]\n\n\nAt the 2020 Summer Olympics, San Marino became the smallest country to earn an Olympic medal when Alessandra Perilli won a bronze medal in the women's trap.[38] They later won another medal, this one silver, with Perilli's and Gian Marco Berti's performance in the mixed trap shooting event.[39]\n\n\nOn 7 March 2022, during the Russia-Ukraine War, the Russian Kremlin released on Twitter a list of countries which it considered \"unfriendly\" to Russia. San Marino was included in the list, alongside numerous well-known Russian adversaries such as the United States and countries in the European Union. The motivation for including San Marino as an \"unfriendly\" nation was unclear, and it gained substantial attention on the Internet.[40]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2022, San Marino officials voted to legalize abortion in the republic, \"one of the last European states to have had the procedure outlawed under all circumstances\".[41] 32 members of the legislature approved the bill while 10 abstained and 7 voted against.[42] The public health system is promised[*clarification needed*] to cover the cost of the abortion procedure.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of San Marino\n\n![](image)Enlargeable, detailed map of San Marino\n![](image)The fortress of *Guaita* on Monte Titano\n![](image)View of the *Guaita* defensive wall\nSan Marino is an enclave surrounded by Italy in Southern Europe, on the border between the regions of Emilia Romagna and Marche and about ten kilometres (six miles) from the Adriatic coast at Rimini. Its hilly topography, with no substantial naturally flat ground, is part of the Apennine mountain range. The highest point in the country, the summit of Monte Titano, is 749 m (2,457 ft) above sea level; the lowest, the Ausa River (ending in the Marecchia),[43] is 55 m (180 ft). San Marino has no still or contained bodies of water of any significant size.\n\n\nIt is one of only three countries in the world to be completely enclosed by another country (the others being Vatican City, also enclosed by Italy, and Lesotho, enclosed by South Africa). It is the third smallest country in Europe, after Vatican City and Monaco, and the fifth-smallest country in the world.[11]\n\n\nThe terrestrial ecoregion of Italian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests lies within San Marino's territory.[44] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 0.01/10, ranking it last globally out of 172 countries.[45]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: *Cfa*), with some continental influences. It has warm to hot summers and cool winters, typical of inland areas of the central Italian Peninsula. Precipitation is scattered throughout the year with no real dry month. Snowfalls are common and heavy almost every winter, especially above 400–500 m (1,300–1,600 feet) of elevation.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for San Marino (2006–2023)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 31.9(89.4)\n | 35.5(95.9)\n | 35.1(95.2)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 30.5(86.9)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 6.4(43.5)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 7.4(45.3)\n | 15.9(60.7)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 4.7(40.5)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 2.5(36.5)\n | 4.8(40.6)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 6.7(44.1)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 10.2(50.3)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | −10.2(13.6)\n | −5.9(21.4)\n | −2.3(27.9)\n | 1.3(34.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 0.9(33.6)\n | −2.8(27.0)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −10.2(13.6)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 50.2(1.98)\n | 63.9(2.52)\n | 64.5(2.54)\n | 59.4(2.34)\n | 70.3(2.77)\n | 54.3(2.14)\n | 40.4(1.59)\n | 40.7(1.60)\n | 75.3(2.96)\n | 70.2(2.76)\n | 99.0(3.90)\n | 61.4(2.42)\n | 749.5(29.51)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 7.2\n | 8.4\n | 8.3\n | 7.9\n | 8.6\n | 4.8\n | 4.3\n | 4.5\n | 6.8\n | 7.1\n | 10.2\n | 8.3\n | 86.3\n |\n| Source: Arpae Emilia-Romagna[46] |\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of San Marino\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of San Marino, Constitution of San Marino, Capital punishment in San Marino, San Marino passport, Law enforcement in San Marino, and Elections in San Marino\n\n![](image)The Palazzo Pubblico, seat of the government of San Marino\n![](image)Four former captains regent: from left to right, Mirko Tomassoni, Alessandro Rossi, Alessandro Mancini, and Alberto Selva\nSan Marino has the political framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic: the captains regent are heads of state,[47] and there is a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Although there is no formal head of government, the secretary for foreign and political affairs is in many ways equal to the prime minister in other countries.[48] Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n\nSan Marino is considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect, as the Statutes of 1600 are still at the core of its constitutional framework.[49]\n\n\nSan Marino was originally led by the Arengo, initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two captains regent were nominated by the council. Still today, Captains Regent are elected every six months by the council.\n\n\nThe legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (*Consiglio grande e generale*). The council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old parishes of the republic. All citizens 18 years or older are eligible to vote.\n\n\nBesides general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the captains regent, the State Congress (composed of ten secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the judicial branch during the period of legislature of the council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councilors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.\n\n\nEvery six months, the council elects two captains regent to be the heads of state. The captains are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\n\n\nThe practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic. The council is equivalent to the Roman Senate; the captains regent, to the consuls of ancient Rome. It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.\n\n\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing Pact for San Marino, led by the San Marinese Christian Democratic Party; and the left-wing Reforms and Freedom, led by the Party of Socialists and Democrats, a merger of the Socialist Party of San Marino and the former communist Party of Democrats. The 2008 general election was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against Reforms and Freedom's 25.\n\n\nOn 1 October 2007, Mirko Tomassoni was elected as captain regent, making him the first disabled person elected to that office.[50]\n\n\nSan Marino has had more female heads of state than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice. With regard to the legal profession, while the Order of Lawyers and Notaries of the Republic of San Marino (*Ordine degli Avvocati e Notai della Repubblica di San Marino*) exists, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups have fared in the legal field.\n\n\nOn 1 April 2022, 58-year-old Paolo Rondelli was elected as one of the two captains regent, its heads of state. He had previously been the Ambassador to the United States and is the world's first openly gay head of state.[51]\n\n\n\n### Administrative division[edit]\n\n\n#### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of San Marino\nSan Marino is divided into nine municipalities, known locally as **castelli** (meaning \"castles\"):\n\n\n\n* San Marino (City of San Marino, officially **Città di San Marino**) is the capital.\n\n\nAnd eight minor municipalities:\n\n\n\n* Acquaviva\n* Borgo Maggiore\n* Chiesanuova\n* Domagnano\n* Faetano\n* Fiorentino\n* Montegiardino\n* Serravalle\n\n\nThe largest settlement of the Republic is Dogana, which is not an autonomous **castello**, but rather belongs to the Castello of Serravalle.\n\n\nIn a similar way to an Italian **comune**, each **castello** includes a main settlement, called **capoluogo**, which is the seat of the **castello**, and some even smaller localities known as **frazioni**.\n\n\n\n#### Curacies[edit]\n\n\nThe republic is made up of 43 parishes,[52] named *curacies* (Italian: *curazie*): Cà Berlone, Cà Chiavello, Cà Giannino, Cà Melone, Cà Ragni, Cà Rigo, Cailungo, Caladino, Calligaria, Canepa, Capanne, Casole, Castellaro, Cerbaiola, Cinque Vie, Confine, Corianino, Crociale, Dogana, Falciano, Fiorina, Galavotto, Gualdicciolo, La Serra, Lesignano, Molarini, Montalbo, Monte Pulito, Murata, Pianacci, Piandivello, Poggio Casalino, Poggio Chiesanuova, Ponte Mellini, Rovereta, San Giovanni sotto le Penne, Santa Mustiola, Spaccio Giannoni, Teglio, Torraccia, Valdragone, Valgiurata, and Ventoso.\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sammarinese Armed Forces\n\nSan Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of Italy's armed forces. Different branches have varied functions, including performing ceremonial duties, patrolling borders, mounting guard at government buildings, and assisting police in major criminal cases. The police are not included in the military of San Marino.\n\n\n\n#### Crossbow Corps[edit]\n\n\nOnce at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.\n\n\n\n#### Guard of the Rock[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Guards of the Rock\nThe Guard of the Rock is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them.[53] In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in San Marino City, the seat of national government.\n\n\nIn this role they are the forces most visible to tourists and are known for their colourful ceremony of Changing the Guard.[53] Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as \"Criminal Police Officers\" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.[53]\n\n\n\n#### Guard of the Grand and General Council[edit]\n\n\nThe Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the council or locally as the \"Guard of Nobles\", formed in 1741,[53] is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the council are to protect the captains regent, and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.\n\n\n\n#### Company of Uniformed Militia[edit]\n\n\nIn former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.\n\n\nThe uniform is dark blue, with a kepi bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.\n\n\n\n#### Military Ensemble[edit]\n\n\nFormally this is part of the Army Militia,[53] and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 60 musicians.[54] The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.\n\n\n\n#### Gendarmerie[edit]\n\n\nEstablished in 1842, the Gendarmerie of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency.[53] Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.\n\n\nThe entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the *Corpi Militari Volontari*, or Voluntary Military Force.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of San Marino, Sammarinese euro coins, Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino, and List of banks in San Marino\n\n![](image)Tourism and banking are the country's main sources of revenue.\nSan Marino is a developed country,[55] and although it is not a European Union member it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins. Before the euro, the Sammarinese lira was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the Italian lira. The small number of Sammarinese euro coins, as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to coin collectors.\n\n\nSan Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of Italy. Key industries include banking, electronics, and ceramics. The main agricultural products are wine and cheese. San Marino imports mainly staple goods from Italy.\n\n\nSan Marino's postage stamps, which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to philatelists and are a significant source of income.[56] San Marino is no longer a member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation.[57]\n\n\nIt has the world's third highest rate of car ownership, being one of only a handful of countries with more vehicles than people.[58] As of October 2023, Gibraltar had the highest rate of car ownership per capita, and Guernsey was in the number two spot.[59]\n\n\n\n### Taxation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.*Find sources:* \"San Marino\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(October 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 8.5%. Capital gains are also subject to an 8.5% tax, and interest from bank deposits is subject to an 11% tax.[60] Several benefits apply to new businesses, which can strongly reduce the amount of taxes to be paid.\n\n\nThe personal income tax (IGR, Italian: *Imposta Generale sui Redditi*) was introduced in 1984 and it was heavily reformed in 2013 with the goal of increasing fiscal revenue. The nominal tax rate ranges from 9% for an annual revenue below €10,000 to 35% for revenues above €80,000.\n\n\nIn 1972, a value-added tax (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and an equivalent tax was introduced also in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. However, this tax is not a standard value-added tax, but rather it is an import tax, thus, it is levied only on imported goods and raw resources. For this reason it is locally best known as single stage tax (Italian: *imposta monofase*), as it is only applied one time during importation, while VAT is applied at every exchange. Furthermore, while VAT also applies to services, the import tax only applies on physical goods. Another important difference is that while VAT is computed on the final price paid by the consumer, the import tax is levied on the importation cost paid by the company, which is generally much lower.\n\n\nUnder the European Union customs agreement, San Marino import tax is considered equivalent to the European VAT system. A separate tax on services, with a rate of 3%, has been introduced in 2011. The introduction of a true VAT system, not dissimilar from the European one, is under development.\n\n\nBecause San Marino's tax rate is lower than surrounding Italy's, many businesses choose to be based in San Marino to avoid the higher rates. San Marino boasts a corporate rate 14.5% lower than Italy (23%) and 12.5% lower than the EU average (21.3%). This has made San Marino the tax haven of choice for many wealthy Italians and businesses.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in San Marino\n\nThe tourism sector contributes over 22% of San Marino's GDP,[61] with approximately 2 million tourists having visited in 2014.[62]\n\n\n\n### Conventions with Italy[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino and Italy have engaged in conventions since 1862,[63] dictating some economic activities in San Marino's territory.\n\n\nCultivation of tobacco and production of goods which are subject to Italy's government monopoly are forbidden in San Marino. Direct import is forbidden; all goods coming from a third party have to travel through Italy before reaching the country. Although it is allowed to print its own postal stamps, San Marino is not allowed to coin its own currency and is obliged to use Italy's mint; the agreement does not affect the right of the Republic of San Marino to continue to issue gold coins denominated in Scudi[64] (the legal value of 1 gold Scudo is 37.50 euros). Gambling is legal and regulated; however, casinos were outlawed prior to 2007. There is one legally operating casino.\n\n\nIn exchange for these limitations, Italy provides San Marino with an annual stipend, provided at cost, of sea salt (not more than 250 tonnes per year), tobacco (40 tonnes), cigarettes (20 tonnes) and matches (unlimited amount).[65]\n\n\nAt the border there are no formalities with Italy. However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase officially cancelled souvenir stamps for their passports.\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Over 48.4% of the population profess the Catholic faith, and approximately half of those regularly attend church. There is no episcopal see in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses, mostly in the Diocese of Montefeltro, and partly in the Diocese of Rimini. In 1977, the border between Montefeltro and Rimini was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino resides in Pennabilli, in Italy's province of Pesaro e Urbino. The country's high Roman Catholic majority can mainly be traced back to the country's founding, when Saint Marinus set up the first fortress to protect Christians from Roman persecution.[66] The small state's culture has primarily remained Catholic ever since.\n\n\nThere is a provision under the income tax rules that taxpayers have the right to request the allocation of 0.3% of their income tax to the Catholic Church or to charities.\n\n\nThe Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro was until 1977 the historic diocese of Montefeltro. It is a suffragan of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia.[67] The diocese includes all the parishes of San Marino. The earliest mention of Montefeltro, as *Mona Feretri*, is in the diplomas by which Charlemagne confirmed the donation of Pepin. The first known bishop of Montefeltro was Agatho (826), whose residence was at San Leo. Under Bishop Flaminios Dondi (1724) the see was again transferred to San Leo, but later it returned to Pennabilli. The historic diocese was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Urbino.[68] Since 1988, there is formally an apostolic nunciature to the republic, but it is vested in the nuncio to Italy.\n\n\nOther faiths include the Waldensian Church and Jehovah's Witnesses.\nThere has been a Jewish presence in San Marino for at least 600 years.[69] The first mention of Jews in San Marino dates to the late 14th century, in official documents recording the business transactions of Jews. There are many documents throughout the 15th to 17th centuries describing Jewish dealings and verifying the presence of a Jewish community in San Marino.[70] Jews were permitted official protection by the government.\n\n\nDuring World War II, San Marino provided a haven for more than 100,000 Jews and other Italians (approximately 10 times the Sammarinese population at the time) from Nazi persecution. As of 2012[update], few Jews remain.[71]\n\n\nIn 2019, the sculpture \"Dialogue\" by Michele Chiaruzzi was inaugurated at Saint Anne Chapel, the first monument of its kind devoted to interfaith dialogue.[72]\n\n\n\n\n\nReligions in San Marino (2011)[1]\n| Religion | %\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Roman Catholic | 97.2%\n |\n| Protestant | 1.1%\n |\n| Other Christian | 0.7%\n |\n| Jewish | 0.1%\n |\n| Other | 0.1%\n |\n| Not religious | 0.7%\n |\n| No answer | 0.1%\n |\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Authorities license private vehicles with distinctive Sammarinese license plates, which are white with blue figures and the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers. Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is \"RSM\".\n\n\nThere are no public airports in San Marino, but there is a small private airstrip located in Torraccia. Most tourists who arrive by air land at Federico Fellini International Airport (close to the Italian city of Rimini), then make the transfer by bus.\n\n\nTwo rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no port or harbour.\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino public transport comprises eight local bus lines entirely within San Marino. Cross-border connection to Rimini is available across a highway bridge in Rovereta.\n\n\nThere is a regular bus service between Rimini and the city of San Marino that is popular with both tourists and workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately 20 locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at Rimini railway station and San Marino coach station.\n\n\nA limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi companies operating in the republic,[73] and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial tramway to Monte Titano\nThere is a 1.5-kilometre (1 mi) aerial tramway connecting the City of San Marino on top of Monte Titano with Borgo Maggiore, a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. From here a further connection is available to the nation's largest settlement, Dogana, via the local bus service.\n\n\nTwo aerial tramway cars (gondolas) operate, with service provided at roughly 15-minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ferrovia Rimini–San Marino\n\nToday, there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period before World War II, it had a single narrow-gauge line called the Ferrovia Rimini–San Marino which connected the country with the Italian rail network at Rimini. Because of the difficulties in accessing the capital, City of San Marino, with its mountain-top location, the terminus station was planned to be located in the village of Valdragone but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June 1932.[74]\nAn advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and had a high frequency of passengers but was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Many facilities such as bridges, tunnels, and stations remain visible today, and some have been converted to parks, public footpaths, or traffic routes. Debate continues on whether the line should be restored, as Rimini is the nearest bigger city and has access to the Adriatic sea, the Italian railway network, and the Federico Fellini International Airport.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on the |\n| Culture of San Marino |\n| ![](image) |\n| History |\n| People |\n| Languages |\n| Cuisine |\n| Festivals |\n| Religion |\n| Music |\n| Media\n* Television\n |\n| Sport |\n| Monuments\n* World Heritage Sites\n |\n| Symbols\n* Flag\n* Coat of arms\n* National anthem\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The three towers are: *Guaita*, the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the 11th century); the 13th-century *Cesta*, located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits; and the 14th-century *Montale*, on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.\n\n\n\n### University[edit]\n\n\nThe *Università degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino* (University of the Republic of San Marino)[75] is the main university, which includes the *Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici di San Marino* (Graduate School of Historical Studies), a distinguished research and advanced international study centre governed by an international Scientific Committee coordinated by the emeritus historian Luciano Canfora. Other important institutes are the *Istituto Musicale Sammarinese* (Sammarinese Musical Institute)[76] and the Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino or *Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze San Marino* (International Academy of Sciences San Marino).[77] The latter is known for adopting Esperanto as the language for teaching and for scientific publications; further, it makes wide use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning).\n\n\nItalian author Umberto Eco had attempted to create a \"university without physical structures\" in San Marino.[78]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in San Marino\n\nSee also: San Marino at the Olympics and Football in San Marino\n\nIn San Marino football is the most popular sport. Basketball and volleyball are also popular. The three sports have their own federations, the San Marino Football Federation, the San Marino Basketball Federation and the San Marino Volleyball Federation.\n\n\nThe San Marino national football team has had little success, being made up of part-timers, such as local plumbers and farmers. Never qualifying for a major tournament, and recording only one win in over 25 years of its history, a 1–0 victory in 2004 against Liechtenstein.[79] They have drawn four more, with their most notable result being a 1993 0–0 draw with Turkey during the European qualifiers for the 1994 FIFA World Cup.[80] In the same qualifying competition Davide Gualtieri scored a goal 8.3 seconds into a match against England; this goal held the record for the fastest in international football until 2016.[81][82] San Marino has a club in the Italian league system called A.S.D.V. San Marino and a domestic amateur league, the Campionato Sammarinese, whose teams also participate in European club competitions. Together with Italy, San Marino held the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, with teams playing at the Stadio Olimpico in Serravalle. With Italy being the sole automatic qualifiers, the Sammarinese team was not participating in the final tournament.\n\n\n\n![](image)2005 San Marino Grand Prix held in Imola, Italy\nA Formula One race, the San Marino Grand Prix, was named after the state, although it did not take place there. Instead, it was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in the Italian town of Imola, about 100 km (60 mi) northwest of San Marino. Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna suffered fatal accidents a day apart during the 1994 Grand Prix. This international event was removed from the calendar in 2007, although the circuit has since returned to the calendar as the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.\n\n\nThe San Marino and Rimini's Coast motorcycle Grand Prix was reinstated in the schedule in 2007 and takes place at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli, as does San Marino's round of the World Superbike Championship.\n\n\nSan Marino has a professional baseball team which plays in Italy's top division. It has participated in the European Cup tournament for the continent's top club sides several times, hosting the event in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2007. It won the championship in 2006, 2011 and 2014.\n\n\nShooting is also very popular in San Marino, with many shooters having taken part in international competitions and the Olympic Games. San Marino is also the smallest country to have ever won an Olympic medal, having won one silver and a bronze in shooting in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Despite their small population, they got their silver in a team event losing the gold medal match to Spain 41–40.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sammarinese cuisine\n\n![](image)A *piadina*, a dish characteristic of the Italian region of Romagna and of its enclave of San Marino\nThe cuisine of San Marino is extremely similar to Italian, especially that of the adjoining Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions, but it has a number of its own unique dishes and products.[83] Its best known is probably the *Torta Tre Monti* (\"Cake of the Three Mountains\" or \"Cake of the Three Towers\"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the Three Towers of San Marino. The country also has a small wine industry.\n\n\n\n### UNESCO[edit]\n\n\nThe site San Marino: Historic Centre and Mount Titano became part of the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2008.[84] The decision was taken during the 32nd Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee composed of 21 countries convened in Québec, Canada.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of San Marino and San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

A well-known 17th-century composer is Francesco Maria Marini. The pop singer Little Tony achieved considerable success in the United Kingdom and Italy in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\nSan Marino has taken part in the Eurovision Song Contest eleven times, achieving three final qualifications to date (with then-three, eventually four-time contestant and San Marino native Valentina Monetta with \"Maybe\" in 2014, Turkish singer Serhat with \"Say Na Na Na\" who achieved 19th place in the final in 2019 and Italian singer Senhit along with American rapper Flo Rida who qualified for the 2021 final with the song \"Adrenalina\").\n\n\n\n### Public holidays and festivals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public holidays in San Marino\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Name\n | Explanation\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 January\n | New Year's Day | Festival marking the beginning of the new year\n |\n| 6 January\n | Epiphany | Commemorates the visit of the three wise men or magi to the infant Jesus\n |\n| 5 February\n | Feast of Saint Agatha | Commemoration of Saint Agatha, co-patroness of the Republic after the country was liberated from foreign rule on her feast day in 1740[21] |\n| Variable, the first Sunday after the first full moon after the vernal equinox | Easter | Resurrection of Jesus |\n| Variable, the Monday after Easter Sunday\n | Easter Monday | Monday after Easter day\n |\n| 25 March\n | Anniversary of the Arengo | Anniversary of the 1906 Arengo and the Festa delle Milizie (Feast of the Militants)\n |\n| 1 May\n | Labour Day | Celebration of workers and employees\n |\n| *Variable*, the first Thursday after Trinity Sunday | Corpus Christi | Commemoration of the body and blood of Jesus Christ\n |\n| 28 July\n | Liberation from Fascism\n | Commemoration of the fall of the Sammarinese Fascist Party |\n| 15 August\n | Ferragosto (Assumption)\n | Commemoration of the Virgin Mary's assumption into heaven\n |\n| 3 September\n | The Feast of Saint Marinus and the Republic\n | National feast of Saint Marinus (San Marino), celebrating the origin of the Republic in 301\n |\n| 1 November\n | All Saints' Day | Feast dedicated to all saints\n |\n| 2 November\n | All Souls'Day | Remembrance of all those who gave their lives for San Marino in war\n |\n| 8 December\n | Immaculate Conception | Remembrance of the Virgin Mary's conception without original sin\n |\n| 24 December\n | Christmas Eve | Day before the commemoration of the birth of Jesus |\n| 25 December\n | Christmas | Birth of Jesus |\n| 26 December\n | Saint Stephen's Day | Commemoration of the death of Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr\n |\n| 31 December\n | New Year's Eve | Celebration which closes and marks the end of the year\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* The Catholic Guide and Scout Association of San Marino\n* City-state\n* Index of San Marino–related articles\n* Outline of San Marino\n* Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino\n* Telecommunications in San Marino\n* Order of San Marino and Order of Saint Agatha\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** San Marino. *The World Factbook*.

The nearest airport is also in Italy. The country's capital city, the City of San Marino, is located atop Monte Titano, while its largest settlement is Dogana within the largest municipality of Serravalle. San Marino's official language is Italian.\n\n\nThe country derives its name from Saint Marinus, a stonemason from the then-Roman island of Rab in present-day Croatia. Born in AD 275, Marinus participated in the rebuilding of Rimini's city walls after their destruction by Liburnian pirates. Marinus then went on to found an independently ruled monastic community on Monte Titano in AD 301; thus, San Marino lays claim to being the oldest extant sovereign state, as well as the oldest constitutional republic.[12]\n\n\nUniquely, San Marino's constitution dictates that its democratically elected legislature, the Grand and General Council, must elect two heads of state every six months. Known as captains regent, the two heads of state serve concurrently and with equal powers until their term expires after six months.\n\n\nThe country's economy is mainly based on finance, industry, services, retail, and tourism. It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world in GDP per capita, with a figure comparable to the most developed European regions.[1] Despite this fact, ranking 44th, its Human Development Index score is the lowest in Western Europe.[6] Its health care system ranked 3rd in the first ever World Health Organization analysis of the world's health systems.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of San Marino\n\n![](image)Illustration of Saint Marinus, the founder of the Republic of San Marino and prominent cultural figure\nSaint Marinus left the island of Rab in present-day Croatia with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of Rimini as a stonemason. After the Diocletianic Persecution following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby Monte Titano, where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino.\n\n\nThe official founding date is 3 September 301 AD.[14] In 1291 San Marino appealed to the bishop of Arezzo, Ildebrandino Guidi di Romena, against the contribution demands by the Vicario del Montefeltro. Jurist Palamede di Rimini, decided in favour of San Marino and recognised its tax exemption from tributes demands of Montefeltro. In 1296, when Guglielmo Durante was the governor of Romagna, Sammarinesi appealed to Pope Boniface VIII against the further requests by the Montefeltro podestas regarding tributes. Abbot Ranieri di Sant'Anastasio was assigned to judge the dispute. A long process was held using various witnesses and sources to determine San Marino tax's exemption status. The verdict was probably in favour of the autonomy of San Marino, as later the State has never paid taxes to the Montefeltro.[15]\n\n\nIn 1320, the community of Chiesanuova chose to join the country.[16] In 1463, San Marino was enlarged to include the communities of Faetano, Fiorentino, Montegiardino, and Serravalle, since then the country's borders have remained unchanged.[17]\n\n\nIn 1503, Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, occupied the Republic for six months until his father's successor, Pope Julius II, intervened and restored the country's independence.[18]\n\n\nOn 4 June 1543, Fabiano di Monte San Savino, nephew of the later Pope Julius III, attempted to conquer the republic, but his infantry and cavalry failed as they got lost in a dense fog, which the Sammarinese attributed to Saint Quirinus, whose feast day it was.[19]\n\n\nAfter the Duchy of Urbino was annexed by the Papal States in 1625, San Marino became an enclave within the papal states. This led to its seeking the formal protection of the Papal States in 1631, but this never amounted to a *de facto* Papal control of the republic.[20]\n\n\nThe country was occupied on 17 October 1739 by the legate (Papal governor) of Ravenna, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, but independence was restored by Pope Clement XII on 5 February 1740, the feast day of Saint Agatha, after which she became a patron saint of the republic.[21]\n\n\nThe advance of Napoleon's army in 1797 presented a brief threat to the independence of San Marino, but the country was saved from losing its liberty by one of its regents, Antonio Onofri, who managed to gain the respect and friendship of Napoleon. Due to Onofri's intervention, Napoleon promised, in a letter to Gaspard Monge, scientist and commissary of the French Government for Science and Art, to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic, even offering to extend its territory according to its needs. The offer was declined by the regents, fearing future retaliation from other states' revanchism.[22][23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anita and Giuseppe Garibaldi in San Marino, 1849\n![](image)The San Marino constitution, or more precisely statutes, of 1600\nDuring the later phase of the Italian unification process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification, including Giuseppe Garibaldi and his wife Anita. Garibaldi allowed San Marino to remain independent. San Marino and the Kingdom of Italy signed a Convention of Friendship in 1862.[24]\n\n\nThe government of San Marino made United States President Abraham Lincoln an honorary citizen. He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that \"government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring\".[25][26]\n\n\n\n### 20th century onwards[edit]\n\n\nDuring World War I, when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 24 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of Carabinieri in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not acquiesce. Two groups of ten volunteers joined the Italian forces in the fighting on the Italian front, the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.[27]\n\n\nAfter the war, San Marino suffered from high rates of unemployment and inflation, leading to increased tension between the lower and middle classes. The latter, fearing that the moderate government of San Marino would make concessions to the lower class majority, began to show support for the Sammarinese Fascist Party (*Partito Fascista Sammarinese*, PFS), founded in 1922 and styled largely on their Italian counterpart. PFS rule lasted from 1923 to 1943, and during this time they often sought support from Benito Mussolini's fascist government in Italy.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)British troops at Monte Titano during the Battle of San Marino, September 1944\nDuring World War II, San Marino remained neutral, although it was wrongly reported in an article in *The New York Times* that it had declared war on the United Kingdom on 17 September 1940.[29] The Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that they had not declared war on the United Kingdom.[30]\n\n\nOn 28 July 1943, three days after the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, PFS rule collapsed and the new government declared neutrality in the conflict. The PFS regained power on 1 April 1944, but kept neutrality intact. Despite that, on 26 June 1944, San Marino was bombed by the Royal Air Force, in the belief that San Marino had been overrun by German forces and was being used to amass stores and ammunition. The Sammarinese government declared on the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter.[31] San Marino accepted thousands of civilian refugees when Allied forces went over the Gothic Line.[32] In September 1944, it was briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by Allied forces in the Battle of San Marino.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSan Marino had the world's first democratically elected communist government – a coalition between the Sammarinese Communist Party and the Sammarinese Socialist Party, which held office between 1945 and 1957.[33][34] The coalition lost power through the fatti di Rovereta.\n\n\nSan Marino became a member of the Council of Europe in 1988 and of the United Nations in 1992. It is not a member of the European Union, although it uses the euro as its currency (despite not legally being part of the Eurozone). Before the introduction of the euro, the country's currency was the Sammarinese lira.\n\n\nAs of June 2020, San Marino had the highest death rate per capita of any country, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[35] In April 2021, it was reported that San Marino was using the Russian Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine rather than vaccines approved by the EU, following a slow rollout for the latter vaccines.[36][37]\n\n\nAt the 2020 Summer Olympics, San Marino became the smallest country to earn an Olympic medal when Alessandra Perilli won a bronze medal in the women's trap.[38] They later won another medal, this one silver, with Perilli's and Gian Marco Berti's performance in the mixed trap shooting event.[39]\n\n\nOn 7 March 2022, during the Russia-Ukraine War, the Russian Kremlin released on Twitter a list of countries which it considered \"unfriendly\" to Russia. San Marino was included in the list, alongside numerous well-known Russian adversaries such as the United States and countries in the European Union. The motivation for including San Marino as an \"unfriendly\" nation was unclear, and it gained substantial attention on the Internet.[40]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2022, San Marino officials voted to legalize abortion in the republic, \"one of the last European states to have had the procedure outlawed under all circumstances\".[41] 32 members of the legislature approved the bill while 10 abstained and 7 voted against.[42] The public health system is promised[*clarification needed*] to cover the cost of the abortion procedure.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of San Marino\n\n![](image)Enlargeable, detailed map of San Marino\n![](image)The fortress of *Guaita* on Monte Titano\n![](image)View of the *Guaita* defensive wall\nSan Marino is an enclave surrounded by Italy in Southern Europe, on the border between the regions of Emilia Romagna and Marche and about ten kilometres (six miles) from the Adriatic coast at Rimini. Its hilly topography, with no substantial naturally flat ground, is part of the Apennine mountain range. The highest point in the country, the summit of Monte Titano, is 749 m (2,457 ft) above sea level; the lowest, the Ausa River (ending in the Marecchia),[43] is 55 m (180 ft). San Marino has no still or contained bodies of water of any significant size.\n\n\nIt is one of only three countries in the world to be completely enclosed by another country (the others being Vatican City, also enclosed by Italy, and Lesotho, enclosed by South Africa). It is the third smallest country in Europe, after Vatican City and Monaco, and the fifth-smallest country in the world.[11]\n\n\nThe terrestrial ecoregion of Italian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests lies within San Marino's territory.[44] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 0.01/10, ranking it last globally out of 172 countries.[45]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: *Cfa*), with some continental influences. It has warm to hot summers and cool winters, typical of inland areas of the central Italian Peninsula. Precipitation is scattered throughout the year with no real dry month. Snowfalls are common and heavy almost every winter, especially above 400–500 m (1,300–1,600 feet) of elevation.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for San Marino (2006–2023)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 31.9(89.4)\n | 35.5(95.9)\n | 35.1(95.2)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 30.5(86.9)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 6.4(43.5)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 7.4(45.3)\n | 15.9(60.7)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 4.7(40.5)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 2.5(36.5)\n | 4.8(40.6)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 6.7(44.1)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 10.2(50.3)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | −10.2(13.6)\n | −5.9(21.4)\n | −2.3(27.9)\n | 1.3(34.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 0.9(33.6)\n | −2.8(27.0)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −10.2(13.6)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 50.2(1.98)\n | 63.9(2.52)\n | 64.5(2.54)\n | 59.4(2.34)\n | 70.3(2.77)\n | 54.3(2.14)\n | 40.4(1.59)\n | 40.7(1.60)\n | 75.3(2.96)\n | 70.2(2.76)\n | 99.0(3.90)\n | 61.4(2.42)\n | 749.5(29.51)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 7.2\n | 8.4\n | 8.3\n | 7.9\n | 8.6\n | 4.8\n | 4.3\n | 4.5\n | 6.8\n | 7.1\n | 10.2\n | 8.3\n | 86.3\n |\n| Source: Arpae Emilia-Romagna[46] |\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of San Marino\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of San Marino, Constitution of San Marino, Capital punishment in San Marino, San Marino passport, Law enforcement in San Marino, and Elections in San Marino\n\n![](image)The Palazzo Pubblico, seat of the government of San Marino\n![](image)Four former captains regent: from left to right, Mirko Tomassoni, Alessandro Rossi, Alessandro Mancini, and Alberto Selva\nSan Marino has the political framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic: the captains regent are heads of state,[47] and there is a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Although there is no formal head of government, the secretary for foreign and political affairs is in many ways equal to the prime minister in other countries.[48] Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n\nSan Marino is considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect, as the Statutes of 1600 are still at the core of its constitutional framework.[49]\n\n\nSan Marino was originally led by the Arengo, initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two captains regent were nominated by the council. Still today, Captains Regent are elected every six months by the council.\n\n\nThe legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (*Consiglio grande e generale*). The council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old parishes of the republic. All citizens 18 years or older are eligible to vote.\n\n\nBesides general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the captains regent, the State Congress (composed of ten secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the judicial branch during the period of legislature of the council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councilors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.\n\n\nEvery six months, the council elects two captains regent to be the heads of state. The captains are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\n\n\nThe practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic. The council is equivalent to the Roman Senate; the captains regent, to the consuls of ancient Rome. It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.\n\n\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing Pact for San Marino, led by the San Marinese Christian Democratic Party; and the left-wing Reforms and Freedom, led by the Party of Socialists and Democrats, a merger of the Socialist Party of San Marino and the former communist Party of Democrats. The 2008 general election was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against Reforms and Freedom's 25.\n\n\nOn 1 October 2007, Mirko Tomassoni was elected as captain regent, making him the first disabled person elected to that office.[50]\n\n\nSan Marino has had more female heads of state than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice. With regard to the legal profession, while the Order of Lawyers and Notaries of the Republic of San Marino (*Ordine degli Avvocati e Notai della Repubblica di San Marino*) exists, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups have fared in the legal field.\n\n\nOn 1 April 2022, 58-year-old Paolo Rondelli was elected as one of the two captains regent, its heads of state. He had previously been the Ambassador to the United States and is the world's first openly gay head of state.[51]\n\n\n\n### Administrative division[edit]\n\n\n#### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of San Marino\nSan Marino is divided into nine municipalities, known locally as **castelli** (meaning \"castles\"):\n\n\n\n* San Marino (City of San Marino, officially **Città di San Marino**) is the capital.\n\n\nAnd eight minor municipalities:\n\n\n\n* Acquaviva\n* Borgo Maggiore\n* Chiesanuova\n* Domagnano\n* Faetano\n* Fiorentino\n* Montegiardino\n* Serravalle\n\n\nThe largest settlement of the Republic is Dogana, which is not an autonomous **castello**, but rather belongs to the Castello of Serravalle.\n\n\nIn a similar way to an Italian **comune**, each **castello** includes a main settlement, called **capoluogo**, which is the seat of the **castello**, and some even smaller localities known as **frazioni**.\n\n\n\n#### Curacies[edit]\n\n\nThe republic is made up of 43 parishes,[52] named *curacies* (Italian: *curazie*): Cà Berlone, Cà Chiavello, Cà Giannino, Cà Melone, Cà Ragni, Cà Rigo, Cailungo, Caladino, Calligaria, Canepa, Capanne, Casole, Castellaro, Cerbaiola, Cinque Vie, Confine, Corianino, Crociale, Dogana, Falciano, Fiorina, Galavotto, Gualdicciolo, La Serra, Lesignano, Molarini, Montalbo, Monte Pulito, Murata, Pianacci, Piandivello, Poggio Casalino, Poggio Chiesanuova, Ponte Mellini, Rovereta, San Giovanni sotto le Penne, Santa Mustiola, Spaccio Giannoni, Teglio, Torraccia, Valdragone, Valgiurata, and Ventoso.\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sammarinese Armed Forces\n\nSan Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of Italy's armed forces. Different branches have varied functions, including performing ceremonial duties, patrolling borders, mounting guard at government buildings, and assisting police in major criminal cases. The police are not included in the military of San Marino.\n\n\n\n#### Crossbow Corps[edit]\n\n\nOnce at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.\n\n\n\n#### Guard of the Rock[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Guards of the Rock\nThe Guard of the Rock is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them.[53] In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in San Marino City, the seat of national government.\n\n\nIn this role they are the forces most visible to tourists and are known for their colourful ceremony of Changing the Guard.[53] Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as \"Criminal Police Officers\" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.[53]\n\n\n\n#### Guard of the Grand and General Council[edit]\n\n\nThe Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the council or locally as the \"Guard of Nobles\", formed in 1741,[53] is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the council are to protect the captains regent, and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.\n\n\n\n#### Company of Uniformed Militia[edit]\n\n\nIn former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.\n\n\nThe uniform is dark blue, with a kepi bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.\n\n\n\n#### Military Ensemble[edit]\n\n\nFormally this is part of the Army Militia,[53] and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 60 musicians.[54] The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.\n\n\n\n#### Gendarmerie[edit]\n\n\nEstablished in 1842, the Gendarmerie of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency.[53] Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.\n\n\nThe entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the *Corpi Militari Volontari*, or Voluntary Military Force.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of San Marino, Sammarinese euro coins, Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino, and List of banks in San Marino\n\n![](image)Tourism and banking are the country's main sources of revenue.\nSan Marino is a developed country,[55] and although it is not a European Union member it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins. Before the euro, the Sammarinese lira was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the Italian lira. The small number of Sammarinese euro coins, as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to coin collectors.\n\n\nSan Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of Italy. Key industries include banking, electronics, and ceramics. The main agricultural products are wine and cheese. San Marino imports mainly staple goods from Italy.\n\n\nSan Marino's postage stamps, which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to philatelists and are a significant source of income.[56] San Marino is no longer a member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation.[57]\n\n\nIt has the world's third highest rate of car ownership, being one of only a handful of countries with more vehicles than people.[58] As of October 2023, Gibraltar had the highest rate of car ownership per capita, and Guernsey was in the number two spot.[59]\n\n\n\n### Taxation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.*Find sources:* \"San Marino\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(October 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 8.5%. Capital gains are also subject to an 8.5% tax, and interest from bank deposits is subject to an 11% tax.[60] Several benefits apply to new businesses, which can strongly reduce the amount of taxes to be paid.\n\n\nThe personal income tax (IGR, Italian: *Imposta Generale sui Redditi*) was introduced in 1984 and it was heavily reformed in 2013 with the goal of increasing fiscal revenue. The nominal tax rate ranges from 9% for an annual revenue below €10,000 to 35% for revenues above €80,000.\n\n\nIn 1972, a value-added tax (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and an equivalent tax was introduced also in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. However, this tax is not a standard value-added tax, but rather it is an import tax, thus, it is levied only on imported goods and raw resources. For this reason it is locally best known as single stage tax (Italian: *imposta monofase*), as it is only applied one time during importation, while VAT is applied at every exchange. Furthermore, while VAT also applies to services, the import tax only applies on physical goods. Another important difference is that while VAT is computed on the final price paid by the consumer, the import tax is levied on the importation cost paid by the company, which is generally much lower.\n\n\nUnder the European Union customs agreement, San Marino import tax is considered equivalent to the European VAT system. A separate tax on services, with a rate of 3%, has been introduced in 2011. The introduction of a true VAT system, not dissimilar from the European one, is under development.\n\n\nBecause San Marino's tax rate is lower than surrounding Italy's, many businesses choose to be based in San Marino to avoid the higher rates. San Marino boasts a corporate rate 14.5% lower than Italy (23%) and 12.5% lower than the EU average (21.3%). This has made San Marino the tax haven of choice for many wealthy Italians and businesses.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in San Marino\n\nThe tourism sector contributes over 22% of San Marino's GDP,[61] with approximately 2 million tourists having visited in 2014.[62]\n\n\n\n### Conventions with Italy[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino and Italy have engaged in conventions since 1862,[63] dictating some economic activities in San Marino's territory.\n\n\nCultivation of tobacco and production of goods which are subject to Italy's government monopoly are forbidden in San Marino. Direct import is forbidden; all goods coming from a third party have to travel through Italy before reaching the country. Although it is allowed to print its own postal stamps, San Marino is not allowed to coin its own currency and is obliged to use Italy's mint; the agreement does not affect the right of the Republic of San Marino to continue to issue gold coins denominated in Scudi[64] (the legal value of 1 gold Scudo is 37.50 euros). Gambling is legal and regulated; however, casinos were outlawed prior to 2007. There is one legally operating casino.\n\n\nIn exchange for these limitations, Italy provides San Marino with an annual stipend, provided at cost, of sea salt (not more than 250 tonnes per year), tobacco (40 tonnes), cigarettes (20 tonnes) and matches (unlimited amount).[65]\n\n\nAt the border there are no formalities with Italy. However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase officially cancelled souvenir stamps for their passports.\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Over 48.4% of the population profess the Catholic faith, and approximately half of those regularly attend church. There is no episcopal see in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses, mostly in the Diocese of Montefeltro, and partly in the Diocese of Rimini. In 1977, the border between Montefeltro and Rimini was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino resides in Pennabilli, in Italy's province of Pesaro e Urbino. The country's high Roman Catholic majority can mainly be traced back to the country's founding, when Saint Marinus set up the first fortress to protect Christians from Roman persecution.[66] The small state's culture has primarily remained Catholic ever since.\n\n\nThere is a provision under the income tax rules that taxpayers have the right to request the allocation of 0.3% of their income tax to the Catholic Church or to charities.\n\n\nThe Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro was until 1977 the historic diocese of Montefeltro. It is a suffragan of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia.[67] The diocese includes all the parishes of San Marino. The earliest mention of Montefeltro, as *Mona Feretri*, is in the diplomas by which Charlemagne confirmed the donation of Pepin. The first known bishop of Montefeltro was Agatho (826), whose residence was at San Leo. Under Bishop Flaminios Dondi (1724) the see was again transferred to San Leo, but later it returned to Pennabilli. The historic diocese was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Urbino.[68] Since 1988, there is formally an apostolic nunciature to the republic, but it is vested in the nuncio to Italy.\n\n\nOther faiths include the Waldensian Church and Jehovah's Witnesses.\nThere has been a Jewish presence in San Marino for at least 600 years.[69] The first mention of Jews in San Marino dates to the late 14th century, in official documents recording the business transactions of Jews. There are many documents throughout the 15th to 17th centuries describing Jewish dealings and verifying the presence of a Jewish community in San Marino.[70] Jews were permitted official protection by the government.\n\n\nDuring World War II, San Marino provided a haven for more than 100,000 Jews and other Italians (approximately 10 times the Sammarinese population at the time) from Nazi persecution. As of 2012[update], few Jews remain.[71]\n\n\nIn 2019, the sculpture \"Dialogue\" by Michele Chiaruzzi was inaugurated at Saint Anne Chapel, the first monument of its kind devoted to interfaith dialogue.[72]\n\n\n\n\n\nReligions in San Marino (2011)[1]\n| Religion | %\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Roman Catholic | 97.2%\n |\n| Protestant | 1.1%\n |\n| Other Christian | 0.7%\n |\n| Jewish | 0.1%\n |\n| Other | 0.1%\n |\n| Not religious | 0.7%\n |\n| No answer | 0.1%\n |\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Authorities license private vehicles with distinctive Sammarinese license plates, which are white with blue figures and the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers. Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is \"RSM\".\n\n\nThere are no public airports in San Marino, but there is a small private airstrip located in Torraccia. Most tourists who arrive by air land at Federico Fellini International Airport (close to the Italian city of Rimini), then make the transfer by bus.\n\n\nTwo rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no port or harbour.\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino public transport comprises eight local bus lines entirely within San Marino. Cross-border connection to Rimini is available across a highway bridge in Rovereta.\n\n\nThere is a regular bus service between Rimini and the city of San Marino that is popular with both tourists and workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately 20 locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at Rimini railway station and San Marino coach station.\n\n\nA limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi companies operating in the republic,[73] and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial tramway to Monte Titano\nThere is a 1.5-kilometre (1 mi) aerial tramway connecting the City of San Marino on top of Monte Titano with Borgo Maggiore, a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. From here a further connection is available to the nation's largest settlement, Dogana, via the local bus service.\n\n\nTwo aerial tramway cars (gondolas) operate, with service provided at roughly 15-minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ferrovia Rimini–San Marino\n\nToday, there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period before World War II, it had a single narrow-gauge line called the Ferrovia Rimini–San Marino which connected the country with the Italian rail network at Rimini. Because of the difficulties in accessing the capital, City of San Marino, with its mountain-top location, the terminus station was planned to be located in the village of Valdragone but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June 1932.[74]\nAn advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and had a high frequency of passengers but was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Many facilities such as bridges, tunnels, and stations remain visible today, and some have been converted to parks, public footpaths, or traffic routes. Debate continues on whether the line should be restored, as Rimini is the nearest bigger city and has access to the Adriatic sea, the Italian railway network, and the Federico Fellini International Airport.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on the |\n| Culture of San Marino |\n| ![](image) |\n| History |\n| People |\n| Languages |\n| Cuisine |\n| Festivals |\n| Religion |\n| Music |\n| Media\n* Television\n |\n| Sport |\n| Monuments\n* World Heritage Sites\n |\n| Symbols\n* Flag\n* Coat of arms\n* National anthem\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

They are depicted on both the flag of San Marino and its coat of arms. The three towers are: *Guaita*, the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the 11th century); the 13th-century *Cesta*, located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits; and the 14th-century *Montale*, on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.\n\n\n\n### University[edit]\n\n\nThe *Università degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino* (University of the Republic of San Marino)[75] is the main university, which includes the *Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici di San Marino* (Graduate School of Historical Studies), a distinguished research and advanced international study centre governed by an international Scientific Committee coordinated by the emeritus historian Luciano Canfora. Other important institutes are the *Istituto Musicale Sammarinese* (Sammarinese Musical Institute)[76] and the Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino or *Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze San Marino* (International Academy of Sciences San Marino).[77] The latter is known for adopting Esperanto as the language for teaching and for scientific publications; further, it makes wide use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning).\n\n\nItalian author Umberto Eco had attempted to create a \"university without physical structures\" in San Marino.[78]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in San Marino\n\nSee also: San Marino at the Olympics and Football in San Marino\n\nIn San Marino football is the most popular sport. Basketball and volleyball are also popular. The three sports have their own federations, the San Marino Football Federation, the San Marino Basketball Federation and the San Marino Volleyball Federation.\n\n\nThe San Marino national football team has had little success, being made up of part-timers, such as local plumbers and farmers. Never qualifying for a major tournament, and recording only one win in over 25 years of its history, a 1–0 victory in 2004 against Liechtenstein.[79] They have drawn four more, with their most notable result being a 1993 0–0 draw with Turkey during the European qualifiers for the 1994 FIFA World Cup.[80] In the same qualifying competition Davide Gualtieri scored a goal 8.3 seconds into a match against England; this goal held the record for the fastest in international football until 2016.[81][82] San Marino has a club in the Italian league system called A.S.D.V. San Marino and a domestic amateur league, the Campionato Sammarinese, whose teams also participate in European club competitions. Together with Italy, San Marino held the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, with teams playing at the Stadio Olimpico in Serravalle. With Italy being the sole automatic qualifiers, the Sammarinese team was not participating in the final tournament.\n\n\n\n![](image)2005 San Marino Grand Prix held in Imola, Italy\nA Formula One race, the San Marino Grand Prix, was named after the state, although it did not take place there. Instead, it was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in the Italian town of Imola, about 100 km (60 mi) northwest of San Marino. Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna suffered fatal accidents a day apart during the 1994 Grand Prix. This international event was removed from the calendar in 2007, although the circuit has since returned to the calendar as the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.\n\n\nThe San Marino and Rimini's Coast motorcycle Grand Prix was reinstated in the schedule in 2007 and takes place at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli, as does San Marino's round of the World Superbike Championship.\n\n\nSan Marino has a professional baseball team which plays in Italy's top division. It has participated in the European Cup tournament for the continent's top club sides several times, hosting the event in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2007. It won the championship in 2006, 2011 and 2014.\n\n\nShooting is also very popular in San Marino, with many shooters having taken part in international competitions and the Olympic Games. San Marino is also the smallest country to have ever won an Olympic medal, having won one silver and a bronze in shooting in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Despite their small population, they got their silver in a team event losing the gold medal match to Spain 41–40.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sammarinese cuisine\n\n![](image)A *piadina*, a dish characteristic of the Italian region of Romagna and of its enclave of San Marino\nThe cuisine of San Marino is extremely similar to Italian, especially that of the adjoining Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions, but it has a number of its own unique dishes and products.[83] Its best known is probably the *Torta Tre Monti* (\"Cake of the Three Mountains\" or \"Cake of the Three Towers\"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the Three Towers of San Marino. The country also has a small wine industry.\n\n\n\n### UNESCO[edit]\n\n\nThe site San Marino: Historic Centre and Mount Titano became part of the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2008.[84] The decision was taken during the 32nd Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee composed of 21 countries convened in Québec, Canada.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of San Marino and San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

A well-known 17th-century composer is Francesco Maria Marini. The pop singer Little Tony achieved considerable success in the United Kingdom and Italy in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\nSan Marino has taken part in the Eurovision Song Contest eleven times, achieving three final qualifications to date (with then-three, eventually four-time contestant and San Marino native Valentina Monetta with \"Maybe\" in 2014, Turkish singer Serhat with \"Say Na Na Na\" who achieved 19th place in the final in 2019 and Italian singer Senhit along with American rapper Flo Rida who qualified for the 2021 final with the song \"Adrenalina\").\n\n\n\n### Public holidays and festivals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public holidays in San Marino\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Name\n | Explanation\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 January\n | New Year's Day | Festival marking the beginning of the new year\n |\n| 6 January\n | Epiphany | Commemorates the visit of the three wise men or magi to the infant Jesus\n |\n| 5 February\n | Feast of Saint Agatha | Commemoration of Saint Agatha, co-patroness of the Republic after the country was liberated from foreign rule on her feast day in 1740[21] |\n| Variable, the first Sunday after the first full moon after the vernal equinox | Easter | Resurrection of Jesus |\n| Variable, the Monday after Easter Sunday\n | Easter Monday | Monday after Easter day\n |\n| 25 March\n | Anniversary of the Arengo | Anniversary of the 1906 Arengo and the Festa delle Milizie (Feast of the Militants)\n |\n| 1 May\n | Labour Day | Celebration of workers and employees\n |\n| *Variable*, the first Thursday after Trinity Sunday | Corpus Christi | Commemoration of the body and blood of Jesus Christ\n |\n| 28 July\n | Liberation from Fascism\n | Commemoration of the fall of the Sammarinese Fascist Party |\n| 15 August\n | Ferragosto (Assumption)\n | Commemoration of the Virgin Mary's assumption into heaven\n |\n| 3 September\n | The Feast of Saint Marinus and the Republic\n | National feast of Saint Marinus (San Marino), celebrating the origin of the Republic in 301\n |\n| 1 November\n | All Saints' Day | Feast dedicated to all saints\n |\n| 2 November\n | All Souls'Day | Remembrance of all those who gave their lives for San Marino in war\n |\n| 8 December\n | Immaculate Conception | Remembrance of the Virgin Mary's conception without original sin\n |\n| 24 December\n | Christmas Eve | Day before the commemoration of the birth of Jesus |\n| 25 December\n | Christmas | Birth of Jesus |\n| 26 December\n | Saint Stephen's Day | Commemoration of the death of Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr\n |\n| 31 December\n | New Year's Eve | Celebration which closes and marks the end of the year\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* The Catholic Guide and Scout Association of San Marino\n* City-state\n* Index of San Marino–related articles\n* Outline of San Marino\n* Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino\n* Telecommunications in San Marino\n* Order of San Marino and Order of Saint Agatha\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** San Marino. *The World Factbook*.
