It was founded as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri in 857–859 and subsequently became one of the leading spiritual and educational centers of the Islamic Golden Age. It was incorporated into Morocco's modern state university system in 1963 and officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" two years later.[1] The mosque building itself is also a significant complex of historical Moroccan and Islamic architecture that features elements from many different periods of Moroccan history.[5]\n\n\nScholars consider al-Qarawiyyin to have been effectively run as a madrasa until after World War II.[6][3][7][8][9] Many scholars distinguish this status from the status of \"university\", which they view as a distinctly European invention.[10][11] They date al-Qarawiyyin's transformation from a madrasa into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.[1][2][3] Some sources, such as UNESCO and the *Guinness World Records*, have cited al-Qarawiyyin as the oldest university or oldest continually operating higher learning institution in the world.[12][13]\n\n\nEducation at the University of al-Qarawiyyin concentrates on the Islamic religious and legal sciences with a heavy emphasis on, and particular strengths in, Classical Arabic grammar/linguistics and *Maliki* Sharia, though lessons on non-Islamic subjects are also offered to students. Teaching is still delivered in the traditional methods.[14] The university is attended by students from all over Morocco and Muslim West Africa, with some also coming from further abroad. Women were first admitted to the institution in the 1940s.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe Arabic name of the university, جَامِعَةُ الْقَرَوِيِّينَ pronounced [ʒaːmiʕtu lqarawijiːn] means \"University of the People from Kairouan (القَيْرَوَان [alqajrawaːn])\". Factors such as the provenance of Fatima al-Fihriya's family in Tunisia,[16] the presence of the letter *Qāf* (ق) – a voiceless uvular plosive which has no equivalent in European languages – the ويّي ([awijiː]) triphthong in the university's name, and the French colonization of Morocco have resulted in a number of different orthographies for the romanization of the university's name, including *al-Qarawiyyin*, a standard anglicization; *Al Quaraouiyine*, following French orthography; and *Al-Karaouine*, another rendering using French orthography.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qarawiyyin Mosque on the skyline of central Fes el-Bali: the green-tiled roofs of the prayer hall and the minaret (white tower on the left) are visible.\n### Foundation of the mosque[edit]\n\n\nIn the 9th century, Fez was the capital of the Idrisid dynasty, considered to be the first Moroccan Islamic state.[17] According to one of the major early sources on this period, the *Rawd al-Qirtas* by Ibn Abi Zar, al-Qarawiyyin was founded as a mosque in 857 or 859 by Fatima al-Fihri, the daughter of a wealthy merchant named Mohammed al-Fihri.[18][4][19][6][20][5]: 9[21]: 40 The al-Fihri family had migrated from Kairouan (hence the name of the mosque), Tunisia to Fez in the early 9th century, joining a community of other migrants from Kairouan who had settled in a western district of the city. Fatima and her sister Mariam, both of whom were well educated, inherited a large amount of money from their father. Fatima vowed to spend her entire inheritance to build a mosque suitable for her community.[22]: 48–49 Similarly, her sister Mariam is also reputed to have founded al-Andalusiyyin Mosque the same year.[23][22]\n\n\nThis foundation narrative has been questioned by some modern historians who see the symmetry of two sisters founding the two most famous mosques of Fez as too convenient and likely originating from a legend.[22]: 48–49[24][21]: 42 Ibn Abi Zar is also judged by contemporary historians to be a relatively unreliable source.[24] One of the biggest challenges to this story is a foundation inscription that was rediscovered during renovations to the mosque in the 20th century, previously hidden under layers of plaster for centuries. This inscription, carved onto cedar wood panels and written in a Kufic script very similar to foundation inscriptions in 9th-century Tunisia, was found on a wall above the probable site of the mosque's original *mihrab* (prior to the building's later expansions). The inscription, recorded and deciphered by Gaston Deverdun, proclaims the foundation of \"this mosque\" (Arabic: \"هذا المسجد\") by Dawud ibn Idris (a son of Idris II who governed this region of Morocco at the time) in *Dhu al-Qadah* 263 AH (July–August of 877 CE).[14] Deverdun suggested the inscription may have come from another unidentified mosque and was moved here at a later period (probably 15th or 16th century) when the veneration of the Idrisids was resurgent in Fez, and such relics would have held enough religious significance to be reused in this way.[14] However, Chafik Benchekroun argued more recently that a more likely explanation is that this inscription is the original foundation inscription of al-Qarawiyyin itself and that it might have been covered up in the 12th century just before the Almohads' arrival in the city.[24] Based on this evidence and on the many doubts about Ibn Abi Zar's narrative, he argues that Fatima al-Fihri is quite possibly a legendary figure rather than a historical one.[24]\n\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nSome scholars suggest that some teaching and instruction probably took place at al-Qarawiyyin Mosque from a very early period[25][22]: 453 or from its beginning.[26]: 287[1]: 71[27] Major mosques in the early Islamic period were typically multi-functional buildings where teaching and education took place alongside other religious and civic activities.[28][29] The al-Andalusiyyin Mosque, in the district across the river, may have also served a similar role up until at least the Marinid period, though it never equaled the Qarawiyyin's later prestige.[22]: 453 It is unclear at what time al-Qarawiyyin began to act more formally as an educational institution, partly because of the limited historical sources that pertain to its early period.[26][30][22] The most relevant major historical texts like the *Rawd al-Qirtas* by Ibn Abi Zar and the *Zahrat al-As* by Abu al-Hasan Ali al-Jazna'i do not provide any clear details on the history of teaching at the mosque,[22]: 453 though al-Jazna'i (who lived in the 14th century) mentions that teaching had taken place there before his time.[31]: 175 Otherwise, the earliest mentions of *halaqa* (circles) for learning and teaching may not have been until the 10th or the 12th century.[32][26] Historian Abdelhadi Tazi indicates the earliest clear evidence of teaching at al-Qarawiyyin in 1121.[25]: 112 Moroccan historian Mohammed Al-Manouni believes that the mosque acquired its function as a teaching institution during the reign of the Almoravids (1040–1147).[30] Historian Évariste Lévi-Provençal dates the beginning of teaching to the Marinid period (1244–1465).[33]\n\n\nIn the 10th century, the Idrisid dynasty fell from power and Fez was contested between the Fatimid and Córdoban Umayyad caliphates and their allies.[17] During this period, the Qarawiyyin Mosque progressively grew in prestige. At some point the *khutba* (Friday sermon) was transferred from the Shurafa Mosque of Idris II (today the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II) to the Qarawiyyin Mosque, granting it the status of Friday mosque (the community's main mosque). This transfer happened either in 919 or in 933, both dates that correspond to brief periods of Fatimid domination over the city, and suggests that the transfer may have occurred by Fatimid initiative.[5]: 12 The mosque and its learning institution continued to enjoy the respect of political elites, with the mosque itself being significantly expanded by the Almoravids and repeatedly embellished under subsequent dynasties.[5] Tradition was established that all the other mosques in Fez based the timing of their call to prayer (*adhan*) according to that of al-Qarawiyyin.[34]\n\n\n\n### Apogee during the Marinid period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Reconstruction of the 14th-century water clock from the *dar al-muwaqqit* of the Qarawiyyin Mosque (on display at the Istanbul Museum of the History of Science and Technology in Islam)\nMany scholars consider al-Qarawiyyin's high point as an intellectual and scholarly center to be in the 13th and 14th centuries, when the curriculum was at its broadest and its prestige had reached new heights after centuries of expansion and elite patronage.[1][34][30]: 141 Among the subjects taught around this period or shortly after were traditional religious subjects such as the Quran and *fiqh* (Islamic jurisprudence), and other sciences like grammar, rhetoric, logic, medicine, mathematics, astronomy and geography.[30][26][1][22]: 455 By contrast, some subjects like alchemy/chemistry were never officially taught as they were considered too unorthodox.[22]: 455\n\n![](image)The Al-Attarine Madrasa (founded in 1323), just north of the Qarawiyyin MosqueStarting in the late 13th century, and especially in the 14th century, the Marinid dynasty was responsible for constructing a number of formal madrasas in the areas around al-Qarawiyyin's main building. The first of these was the Saffarin Madrasa in 1271, followed by al-Attarine in 1323, and the Mesbahiya Madrasa in 1346.[35] A larger but much later madrasa, the Cherratine Madrasa, was also built nearby in 1670.[36] These madrasas taught their own courses and sometimes became well-known institutions, but they usually had narrower curricula or specializations.[34]: 141[37] One of their most important functions seems to have been to provide housing for students from other towns and cities – many of them poor – who needed a place to stay while studying at al-Qarawiyyin.[38]: 137[34]: 110[22]: 463 Thus, these buildings acted as complimentary or auxiliary institutions to al-Qarawiyyin itself, which remained the center of intellectual life in the city.\n\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin also compiled a large selection of manuscripts that were kept at a library founded by the Marinid sultan Abu Inan Faris in 1349.[5][39] The collection housed numerous works from the Maghreb, al-Andalus, and the Middle East.[40] Part of the collection was gathered decades earlier by Sultan Abu Yusuf Ya'qub (ruled 1258–1286), who persuaded Sancho IV of Castile to hand over a number of works from the libraries of Seville, Córdoba, Almeria, Granada, and Malaga in al-Andalus/Spain. Abu Yusuf initially housed these in the nearby Saffarin Madrasa (which he had recently built), but later moved them to al-Qarawiyyin.[40] Among the most precious manuscripts currently housed in the library are volumes from the *Al-Muwatta* of Malik written on gazelle parchment,[41] a copy of the *Sirat* by Ibn Ishaq,[41] a 9th-century Quran manuscript (also written on gazelle parchment),[34]: 148 a copy of the Quran given by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur in 1602,[41] a copy of Ibn Rushd's *Al-Bayan Wa-al-Tahsil wa-al-Tawjih* (a commentary on *Maliki* *fiqh*) dating from 1320,[42][34]: 143 and the original copy of Ibn Khaldun's book *Al-'Ibar* (including the *Muqaddimah*) gifted by the author in 1396.[41][37] Recently rediscovered in the library is an *ijazah* certificate, written on deer parchment, which some scholars claim to be the oldest surviving predecessor of a Medical Doctorate degree, issued to a man called Abdellah Ben Saleh Al Koutami in 1207 CE under the authority of three other doctors and in the presence of the chief *qadi* (judge) of the city and two other witnesses.[43][44] The library was managed by a *qayim* or conservator, who oversaw the maintenance of the collection.[34]: 143[40] By 1613 one conservator estimated the library's collection at 32,000 volumes.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)A document from the Qarawiyyin's library which is claimed by some scholars to be the world's oldest surviving medical degree, issued in 1207 CE\nStudents were male, but traditionally it has been said that \"facilities were at times provided for interested women to listen to the discourse while accommodated in a special gallery (*riwaq*) overlooking the scholars' circle\".[26] The 12th-century cartographer Mohammed al-Idrisi, whose maps aided European exploration during the Renaissance, is said to have lived in Fez for some time, suggesting that he may have worked or studied at al-Qarawiyyin. The institution has produced numerous scholars who have strongly influenced the intellectual and academic history of the Muslim world. Among them are Ibn Rushayd al-Sabti (d. 1321), Mohammed Ibn al-Hajj al-Abdari al-Fasi (d. 1336), Abu Imran al-Fasi (d. 1015) – a leading theorist of the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, and Leo Africanus. Pioneer scholars such as Muhammad al-Idrissi (d.1166 AD), Ibn al-Arabi (1165–1240 AD), Ibn Khaldun (1332–1395 AD), Ibn al-Khatib (d. 1374), Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji (Alpetragius) (d. 1294), and Ali ibn Hirzihim (d. 1163) were all connected with al-Qarawiyyin as either students or lecturers.[41] Some Christian scholars visited al-Qarawiyyin, including Nicolas Cleynaerts (d. 1542)[45][34]: 252 and the Jacobus Golius (d. 1667).[41] The 19th-century orientalist Jousé Ponteleimon Krestovitich also claimed that Gerbert d'Aurillac (later Pope Sylvester II) studied at al-Qarawiyyin in the 10th century.[46][34]: 138 Although this claim about Gerbert is sometimes repeated by modern authors,[20][47] modern scholarship has not produced evidence to support this story.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Decline and reforms[edit]\n\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin underwent a general decline in later centuries along with Fez. The strength of its teaching stagnated and its curriculum decreased in range and scope, becoming focused on traditional Islamic sciences and Arabic linguistic studies. Even some traditional Islamic specializations like *tafsir* (Quranic exegesis) were progressively neglected or abandoned.[1][30] In 1788–89, the Alaouite sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah introduced reforms that regulated the institution's program, but also imposed stricter limits and excluded logic, philosophy, and the more radical Sufi texts from the curriculum.[26][30][50] Other subjects also disappeared over time, such as astronomy and medicine.[30] In 1845 Sultan Abd al-Rahman carried out further reforms, but it is unclear if this had any significant long-term effects.[1][30] Between 1830 and 1906 the number of faculty decreased from 425 to 266 (of which, among the latter, only 101 were still teaching).[1]: 71\n\n\nBy the 19th century, the mosque's library also suffered from decline and neglect.[30][40] A significant portion of its collection was lost over time, most likely due to lax supervision and to books that were not returned.[22]: 472 By the beginning of the 20th century, the collection had been reduced to around 1,600 manuscripts and 400 printed books, though many valuable historic items were retained.[30]\n\n\n\n### 20th century and transformation into state university[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qarawiyyin Mosque in 1916\nAt the time Morocco became a French protectorate in 1912, al-Qarawiyyin worsened as a religious center of learning from its medieval prime,[1] though it retained some significance as an educational venue for the sultan's administration.[1] The student body was rigidly divided along social strata: ethnicity (Arab or Berber), social status, personal wealth, and geographic background (rural or urban) determined the group membership of the students who were segregated by the teaching facility, as well as in their personal quarters.[1] The French administration implemented a number of structural reforms between 1914 and 1947, including the institution of calendars, appointment of teachers, salaries, schedules, general administration, and the replacement of the *ijazah* with the *shahada alamiyha,* but did not modernize the contents of teaching likewise which were still dominated by the traditional worldviews of the *ulama*.[1] At the same time, the student numbers at al-Qarawiyyin decreased to 300 in 1922 as the Moroccan elite sent their children to the newly founded Western-style colleges and institutes elsewhere in the country.[1] In 1931 and 1933, on the orders of Muhammad V, al-Qarawiyyin's teaching was reorganized into elementary, secondary, and higher education.[30][26][50]\n\n\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin also played a role in the Moroccan nationalist movement and in protests against the French colonial regime. Many Moroccan nationalists had received their education here and some of their informal political networks were established due to the shared educational background.[51]: 140, 146 In July 1930, al-Qarawiyyin strongly participated in the propagation of *Ya Latif*, a communal prayer recited in times of calamity, to raise awareness and opposition to the Berber Dahir decreed by the French authorities two months earlier.[52][51]: 143–144 In 1937 the mosque was one of the rallying points (along with the nearby R'cif mosque) for demonstrations in response to a violent crackdown on Moroccan protesters in Meknes, which ended with French troops being deployed across Fes el-Bali and at the mosques.[17]: 387–389[51]: 168\n\n![](image)The main entrance to the library and other southern annexes of the mosque today, off Place SeffarineIn 1947 al-Qarawiyyin was integrated into the state educational system,[7] and women were first admitted to study there during the 1940s.[15] In 1963, after Moroccan independence, al-Qarawiyyin was officially transformed by royal decree into a university under the supervision of the ministry of education.[1][53][2] Classes at the old mosque ceased and a new campus was established at a former French Army barracks.[1] While the dean took his seat at Fez, four faculties were founded in and outside the city: a faculty of Islamic law in Fez, a faculty of Arab studies in Marrakech, and two faculties of theology in Tétouan and near Agadir. Modern curricula and textbooks were introduced and the professional training of the teachers improved.[1][54] Following the reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" in 1965.[1]\n\n\nIn 1975, General Studies was transferred to the newly founded Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University; al-Qarawiyyin kept the Islamic and theological courses of studies.[*citation needed*] In 1973, Abdelhadi Tazi published a three-volume history of the establishment entitled جامع القرويين (*The al-Qarawiyyin Mosque*).[55]\n\n\nIn 1988, after a hiatus of almost three decades, the teaching of traditional Islamic education at al-Qarawiyyin was resumed by King Hassan II in what has been interpreted as a move to bolster conservative support for the monarchy.[1]\n\n\n\n## Education and curriculum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Scholar at the Al-Qarawiyyin library\nEducation at al-Qarawiyyin University concentrates on the Islamic religious and legal sciences with a heavy emphasis on, and particular strengths in, Classical Arabic grammar/linguistics and Maliki law, though some lessons on other non-Islamic subjects such as French and English are also offered to students.[56][57] Teaching is delivered with students seated in a semi-circle around a sheikh, who prompts them to read sections of a particular text; asks them questions on particular points of grammar, law, or interpretation; and explains difficult points. Students from Morocco and Islamic West Africa attend al-Qarawiyyin, though some come from Muslim Central Asia. Spanish Muslim converts frequently attend the institution, largely attracted by the fact that the sheikhs of al-Qarawiyyin, and Islamic scholarship in Morocco in general, are heirs to the rich, religious, and scholarly heritage of Muslim al-Andalus.[56]\n\n\nMost students at al-Qarawiyyin range are between 13 and 30 years old, and study towards high school-level diplomas and university-level bachelor's degrees, although Muslims with a sufficiently high level of Arabic can attend lecture circles on an informal basis, given the traditional category of visitors \"in search of [religious and legal] knowledge\" (\"zuwwaar li'l-talab fii 'ilm\"). In addition to being Muslim, prospective students of al-Qarawiyyin are required to have fully memorized the Quran, as well as other shorter medieval Islamic texts on grammar and *Maliki* law, and to be proficient in classical Arabic.[56][58]\n\n\n\n## Architecture of the mosque[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Floor plan of the mosque and some of its annexes. (Based on an early 20th-century survey; since then the southern part of the complex, the library, has been modified.)Al-Qarawiyyin Mosque was founded in the 9th century, but its present form is the result of a long historical evolution over the course of more than 1,000 years. Successive dynasties expanded the mosque until it became the largest in Africa, with a capacity of 22,000 worshipers.[59] The present-day mosque covers an extensive area of about half a hectare.[34]: 136 Broadly speaking, it consists of a large hypostyle interior space for prayers (the prayer hall), a courtyard with fountains (the *sahn*), a minaret at the courtyard's western end, and a number of annexes around the mosque itself.\n\n\n### Historical evolution[edit]\n\n\n#### Early history (9th–10th centuries)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arches in the prayer hall of the mosque\nThe original mosque building was built in the 9th century. A major modern study of the mosque's structure, published by French archeologist and historian Henri Terrasse in 1968, determined that traces of the original mosque could be found in the layout of the current building.[5]: 10 This initial form of the mosque occupied a large space immediately to the south of the *sahn*, in what is now the prayer hall.[5][60]: 119 It had a rectangular floor plan measuring 36 by 32 meters, covering an area of 1520 square meters, and was composed of a prayer hall with four transverse aisles running roughly east–west, parallel to the southern *qibla* wall.[5][34]: 135 It probably also had a courtyard of relatively small size, and the first minaret, also of small size, reportedly stood on the location now occupied by the wooden *anaza* (at the central entrance to the prayer hall from the courtyard).[5] Water for the mosque was initially provided by a well dug within the mosque's precinct.[5]\n\n\nAs Fez grew and the mosque increased in prestige, the original building was insufficient for its religious and institutional needs.[5][34] During the 10th century, the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba and the Fatimid Caliphate constantly fought for control over Fez and Morocco, seen as a buffer zone between the two.[17] Despite this uncertain period, the mosque received significant patronage and had its first expansions. The Zenata Berber emir Ahmed ibn Abi Said, one of the rulers of Fez during this period who was aligned with the Umayyads, wrote to the caliph Abd al-Rahman III in Córdoba for permission and funds to expand the mosque.[5] The caliph approved, and the work was carried out or completed in 956.[5] It expanded the mosque on three sides, encompassing the area of the present-day courtyard to the north and up to the current eastern and western boundaries of the building.[60] It also replaced the original minaret with a new, larger minaret still standing today. Its overall form, with a square shaft, was indicative of the subsequent development of Maghrebi and Andalusian minarets.[5][60]\n\n\nThe mosque was embellished when the Amirid ruler al-Muzaffar (son of al-Mansur) led a military expedition to Fez in 998. The embellishments included a new *minbar* and a dome topped by talismans in the shape of a rat, a serpent, and a scorpion.[5] Of these, only the dome itself, whose exterior is distinctively fluted or grooved, survives today, located above the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall. A similar dome, located across the courtyard over the northern entrance of the mosque (*Bab al-Ward* or \"Gate of the Rose\"), likely also dates from the same time.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Almoravid expansion (12th century)[edit]\n\n\nOne of the most significant expansions and renovations was carried out between 1135 and 1143 under the patronage of the Almoravid ruler Ali ibn Yusuf.[5] The prayer hall was extended by dismantling the existing southern wall and adding three more transverse aisles for a total of ten, while replicating the format of the existing arches of the mosque.[5][60] This expansion required the purchase and demolition of a number of neighboring houses and structures, including some that were apparently part of the nearby Jewish neighbourhood (before the Mellah of Fez).[5]\n\n\nThe new expansion of the mosque involved not only a new *mihrab* in the middle of the new southern wall, but also the reconstruction or embellishment of the prayer hall's central nave (the arches along its central axis, in a line perpendicular to the southern wall and to the other rows of arches) leading from the courtyard to the *mihrab*. This involved not only embellishing some of the arches with new forms but also adding a series of highly elaborate cupola ceilings composed in *muqarnas* (honeycomb or stalactite-like) sculpting and further decorated with intricate reliefs of arabesques and Kufic letters.[5][62] The craftsmen who worked on this expansion are mostly anonymous, except for two names that are carved on the bases of two of the cupolas: Ibrāhīm and Salāma ibn Mufarrij, who may have been of Andalusi origin.[62]: 76 Lastly, a new *minbar* in similar style and of similar artistic provenance as the *minbar* of the Koutoubia Mosque was completed and installed in 1144.[5] It is made of wood in an elaborate work of marquetry, and decorated with inlaid materials and intricately carved arabesque reliefs. Its style was emulated for later Moroccan minbars.[5][62]\n\n\nElsewhere, many of the mosque's main entrances were given doors made of wood overlaid with ornate bronze fittings, which today count among the oldest surviving bronze artworks in Moroccan architecture.[38][5] Another interesting element added to the mosque was a small secondary oratory, known as the *Jama' al-Gnaiz* (\"Funeral Mosque\" or \"Mosque of the Dead\"), which was separated from the main prayer hall and dedicated to providing funerary rites for the deceased before their burial.[5] The annex is also decorated with a *muqarnas* cupola and ornate archways and windows.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Almohad period (12th–13th centuries)[edit]\n\n\nLater dynasties continued to embellish the mosque or gift it with new furnishings, though no works as radical as the Almoravid expansion were undertaken again. The Almohads (later 12th century and 13th century) conquered Fez after a long siege in 1145–1146.[22][5] Historical sources (particularly the *Rawd al-Qirtas*) report a story claiming that the inhabitants of Fez, fearful that the \"puritan\" Almohads would resent the lavish decoration placed inside the mosque, used whitewash to cover up the most ornate decorations from Ibn Yusuf's expansion near the *mihrab.*[5]: 25–26 Terrasse suggests this operation may have actually been carried out a few years later by the Almohad authorities themselves.[5] The Almoravid ornamentation was only fully uncovered again during renovations in the early 20th century.[63][5] The plaster used to cover the Almoravid decoration seems to have been prepared too quickly and did not fully bond with the existing surface. This ended up making its removal easier during modern restorations and has helped to preserve much of the original Almoravid decoration now visible again today.[62]: 64\n\n\nUnder the reign of Muhammad al-Nasir (r. 1199–1213), the Almohads added and upgraded a number of elements in the mosque, some of which were nonetheless marked with strong decorative flourishes. The ablutions facilities in the courtyard were upgraded, a separate ablutions room was added to the north, and a new underground storage room was created.[5] They also replaced the mosque's grand chandelier with one made of bronze, which Terrasse described as \"the largest and most beautiful chandelier in the Islamic world,\" and which hangs in the central nave of the mosque today.[64][5][60][65] It was commissioned by Abu Muhammad 'Abd Allah ibn Musa, the *khatib* of the mosque during the years 1202 to 1219.[60]: 334 The chandelier has the shape of a 12-sided cupola surmounted by a large cone, around which are nine levels that hold candlesticks. It could originally hold 520 oil candles; the cost of providing the oil was so significant that it was only lit on special occasions, such as on the nights of Ramadan. The Marinid sultan Abu Ya'qub Yusuf (r. 1286–1307), upon seeing the cost, ordered that it only be lit for the last day of Ramadan. The visible surfaces of the chandelier are carved and pierced with intricate floral arabesque motifs as well as Kufic Arabic inscriptions. The chandelier is the oldest surviving chandelier in the western Islamic world, and it likely served as a model for the Marinid chandelier in the Great Mosque of Taza.[60]: 334\n\n\n\n#### Marinid period (13th–14th centuries)[edit]\n\n\nThe Marinids, who were responsible for building many of the madrasas around Fez, made various contributions to the mosque. In 1286 they restored and protected the 10th-century minaret, which had been made from deteriorating poor-quality stone with whitewash.[5] At its southern foot, they also built the *Dar al-Muwaqqit*, a chamber for the timekeeper (*muwaqqit*) of the mosque who was responsible for determining the precise times of prayer. The chamber was equipped with astrolabes and other scientific equipment of the era in order to aid in this task. Several water clocks were built for it in this period. The first two do not exist anymore, but are described by al-Jazna'i in the *Zahrat al-As*.[61] The first was commissioned by Abu Yusuf Ya'qub in the 13th century and designed by Muhammad ibn al-Habbak, a *faqih* and *muwaqqit*.[66][67] The second was built in 1317 or 1318 (717 AH), under the reign of Abu Sa'id, by a scholar named Abu Abdullah Muhammad al-Sanhaji. Its time divisions were engraved by Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn al-Saddina al-Qarsatuni. The clock was neglected then restored between 1346 and 1349 (747–749 AH) by a new *muwaqqit*, Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn al-'Arabi.[61][5]: 62[60]: 492 A third and final water clock, built on the orders of Sultan Abu Salim Ali II (ruled 1359–1361), is still partly preserved today.[60][68][69] It was designed by Abu Zayd Abd al-Rahman ibn Sulayman al-Laja'i and completed on November 20, 1361 (21 Muharram 763 AH), as recorded by an original inscription. It features a large astrolabe with a diameter of 71 cm, which is embedded into a wooden structure in the corner of the room, but its mechanism is no longer present.[61]\n\n* ![View of the Dar al-Muwaqqit, with its double-arched window overlooking the courtyard](image)\n\nView of the *Dar al-Muwaqqit*, with its double-arched window overlooking the courtyard\n* ![The astrolabe of the water clock device completed in 1361 by al-Laja'i](image)\n\nThe astrolabe of the water clock device completed in 1361 by al-Laja'i\n\nThe galleries around the *sahn* were also rebuilt or repaired in 1283 and 1296–97, while at the entrance from the courtyard to the prayer hall (leading to the central nave of the mihrab), a decorative wooden screen, called the *anaza,* was installed in 1289 and acted as a symbolic \"outdoor\" or \"summer\" mihrab for prayers in the courtyard.[5] The stucco decoration on the entrance arch itself, however, dates from much later.[61] At the central outer entrance to the courtyard from the north, the cupola ceiling over the entrance vestibule of the gate called *Bab al-Ward* (\"Gate of the Rose\") was redecorated with carved stucco in 1337.[5][61] The richly-sculpted archway on the inner side of the gate also dates from this time.[61]\n\n* ![Marinid decoration in the cupola over the vestibule of Bab al-Ward, the central northern gate of the mosque](image)\n\nMarinid decoration in the cupola over the vestibule of *Bab al-Ward*, the central northern gate of the mosque\n* ![Inner façade of Bab al-Ward, with Marinid-era stucco embellishment](image)\n\nInner façade of *Bab al-Ward*, with Marinid-era stucco embellishment\n* ![The wooden anaza at the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall](image)\n\nThe wooden *anaza* at the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall\n\nA number of ornate metal chandeliers hanging in the mosque's prayer hall date from the Marinid era. Three of them were made from church bells which Marinid craftsmen used as a base onto which they grafted ornate copper fittings. The largest of them, installed in the mosque in 1337, was a bell brought back from Gibraltar by the son of Sultan Abu al-Hasan, Abu Malik, after its reconquest from Spanish forces in 1333.[5]\n\n\nThe mosque's library was officially founded by Sultan Abu Inan in 1349 (750 AH), as dated by an inscription over its doorway.[5]: 64[20] This first Marinid library was located at the mosque's northeastern corner (as opposed to the library's current southern location).[20] In 1361, Sultan Abu Salim added a room to it, which was built above and over the adjacent street, and dedicated to readings of the Quran.[5]: 64\n\n\n\n#### Saadian and Alaouite period (16th-century to modern era)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the Saadian pavilions (late 16th and early 17th century) in the courtyard, featuring carved wood and stucco decoration\nThe Saadians embellished the mosque by adding two prominent pavilions to the western and eastern ends of the courtyard, each of which sheltered a new fountain. The Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur was responsible for building the first pavilion to the east in 1587–88, while the western pavilion was added by his grandson Abdallah al-Ghalib II in 1609.[70]: 100 The pavilions emulate the ones in the Court of Lions of the Alhambra palaces (in Granada, Spain).[5][70] Al-Mansur also built a new room for the library on the south side of the mosque (around the library's current location), which was connected to the mosque via a door in the *qibla* wall.[71][20]\n\n\nThe Alaouite dynasty, which has ruled Morocco from the 17th century onward, continued to perform minor additions and regular maintenance on the mosque. A ribbed cupola in the central nave, where the 1337 Marinid chandelier hangs, has been dated by Terrasse to the Alaouite period,[5] although Xavier Salmon has more recently argued that at least some elements of the dome seem to date from the Marinid era.[61] The stucco decoration of the central archway at the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall (i.e. the arch inside which the Marinid-era *anaza* stands) also dates from the Alaouite period; an inscription at the top of the arch gives the year 1864–1865 (1281 AH).[61]\n\n\nThe present library building dates mainly from a major expansion and modification in the 20th century, particularly in the 1940s.[20][71]: 174 The new library expansion, which included a large new reading room, was inaugurated in 1949.[72]\n\n\n\n### Current structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Exterior[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nDoors of Bab al-Gna'iz today, with replicas of the original Almoravid bronze overlays\n![](image)\nFragments of the original bronze overlays of Bab al-Gna'iz, dating to the Almoravid period\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin's exterior does not generally present a monumental appearance and is integrated with the dense urban fabric around it. By one count there are 18 separate gates and entrances distributed around its perimeter.[34] The gates vary from small rectangular doorways to enormous horseshoe arches with huge doors preceded by wooden roofs covering the street in front of them.[5] While the doors are generally made of wood, some of the gates have extensive ornate bronze overlays crafted during the Almoravid period.[5] The most ornate and best-preserved examples include the doors of the principal northern gate, *Bab al-Ward* (which opens onto the courtyard), the western gate called *Bab Sbitriyyin*, and the southwestern gate *Bab al-Gna'iz*, which leads to the *Jama' al-Gna'iz*.[5][62] While the doors of *Bab al-Ward* preserve original pieces and were restored in 2005–2007, the doors of *Bab al-Gna'iz* and *Bab Sbitriyyin* are replicas made in the 1950s that replaced the originals, whose fragments are kept by the Dar Batha Museum.[60]: 56[a] The northwestern gates of the mosque, *Bab al-Shama'in* (or *Bab Chemaine*) and *Bab al-Maqsura*, also have heavy bronze fittings, including some ornate knockers that date from the Almoravid period.[5]\n\n\nAdjacent to *Bab al-Ward*, on its west side, is another doorway, *Bab al-Hafa* (\"Gate of the Barefooted\"). This gate dates to the Almohad era. It is distinguished by a small water channel that runs across the floor just inside it. The channel allowed worshipers entering the mosque to wash their feet on the way in, helping with initial ablutions.[36][5]\n\n\nNext to the mosque is a tower known as the *Borj Neffara* (برج النفارة, \"Tower of the Trumpeters\"), an observation tower that is sometimes confused as a minaret but was actually part of another *Dar al-Muwaqqit*.[73][38]: 150\n\n\n\n#### Prayer hall[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nThe central nave of the mosque, leading towards the *mihrab*, with some of the Almohad and Marinid chandeliers visible\n![](image)\nThe *mihrab* (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer)\n\nThe interior hypostyle prayer hall takes up most of the mosque's area. Like the interior of most traditional mosques in Moroccan architecture, it is a relatively austere space with mostly plain walls, wooden roofs, and rows upon rows of arches. The main area, south of the courtyard, is a vast space divided into ten transverse aisles by rows of arches running parallel to the southern wall.[5] The southern wall of this hall also marks the *qibla*. The central axis of the prayer hall, perpendicular to the *qibla* wall, is marked by a central nave running between two extra lines of arches along this axis, perpendicular to the other arches.[5] This nave leads towards the *mihrab:* a niche in the *qibla* wall which symbolizes the direction of prayer, and in front of which the imam usually leads prayers and delivers sermons. This overall layout (a hypostyle hall with a central nave emphasized against the others) is a familiar layout for North African mosques generally.[5][71]\n\n\nThe *mihrab*, which dates from the Almoravid (12th-century) expansion, is decorated with carved and painted stucco, as well as several windows of coloured glass. The *mihrab* niche itself is a small alcove which is covered by a small dome of *muqarnas* (stalactite or honeycomb-like sculpting).[62] On each side of the *mihrab*'s opening is a pair of engaged marble columns topped by deeply-carved capitals. These capitals are spolia from al-Andalus, dating from the time of the Caliphate of Córdoba, which were re-appropriated by the Almoravids for Ali Ibn Yusuf's expansion of the mosque.[62]: 60 On the mihrab's façade, the stucco ornamentation of the lower parts, immediately around the arch itself, was most likely redone in the 16th and/or early 19th centuries. The stucco decoration of the upper wall above this still dates from the Almoravid period. The Almoravid decoration prioritizes floral motifs, which contain more diversity than the later restorations below, over which bands of Kufic inscriptions have also been carved.[62]: 72–76\n\n\nThe central nave that runs along the axis of the *mihrab* is distinguished from the rest of the mosque by a number of architectural embellishments. The arches that run along it are of varying shapes, including both horseshoe arches and multi-lobed arches.[5] Instead of the plain timber ceilings, most sections of the nave are covered by a series of intricate *muqarnas* ceilings and cupolas, each slightly different from the other, as well as two \"ribbed\" dome cupolas (similar to the domes of the Great Mosque of Córdoba and Cristo de la Luz Mosque in Toledo) dating from the Almoravid and Alaouite periods.[5] The muqarnas vaults are made of plaster and are suspended from a hidden framework of wooden struts above them.[21]: 119–120 Many of the *muqarnas* compositions are further embellished with intricate reliefs of arabesques and Arabic inscriptions in both Kufic and cursive letters, highlighted with blue and red colours.[5][62][21]: 119–120 Additionally, there are several elaborately carved bronze chandeliers hanging in the nave which were gifted to the mosque during the Almohad and Marinid eras; at least three of which were made from bells (probably church bells) brought back from victories in Spain.[5][74]\n\n\nTo the right of the *mihrab* is the *minbar* of the mosque, which could also be stored in a small room behind a door in the *qibla* wall. The *minbar* is most likely of similar origins as the Almoravid *minbar* of the Koutoubia Mosque, made by a workshop in Córdoba not long after the latter and installed in al-Qarawiyyin Mosque in 1144 (at the end of the Almoravid works on the mosque).[5] It is another exceptional work of marquetry and woodcarving, decorated with geometric compositions, inlaid materials, and arabesque reliefs.[5][62]\n\n\nAside from the embellishments of the central nave, the rest of the mosque is architecturally uniform, but there are some minor irregularities in the floor plan. For example, the arches in the western half of the prayer hall are shorter than those in the eastern half, and some of the transverse aisles are slightly wider than others. These anomalies have not been fully explained but they appear to have been present since the early centuries of the mosque; they may be due to early reconstructions or alterations which have gone unrecorded in historical chronicles.[5]\n\n\n\n#### *Sahn*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The courtyard (*sahn*) of the Qarawiyyin Mosque, including the central fountain and one of the Saadian-era pavilions\nThe *sahn* is rectangular, surrounded by the prayer hall on three sides and by a gallery to the north. The floor is paved with typical Moroccan mosaic tiles (*zellij*) and at the center is a fountain.[71] From outside the mosque, the courtyard is accessed by the main northern gate, called *Bab al-Ward*, whose vestibule is covered by a Marinid-era white dome which is fluted on the outside and covered in painted and carved stucco on the inside.[5] Opposite this gate, situated on the mihrab axis, is the central entrance to the interior prayer hall, guarded by a carved and painted wooden screen called the *anaza* which also acted as a symbolic \"outdoor\" or \"summer\" mihrab for prayers taking place in the courtyard.[5] (These features are visible to visitors standing outside the gate.) Both this entrance to the prayer hall and the outer gate across from it have facades decorated with carved and painted stucco.[5]\n\n\nAt the western and eastern ends of the courtyard stand two ornate Saadian pavilions each sheltering another fountain. The pavilions have pyramidal domes and emulate the pavilions in the Court of the Lions in the Alhambra (Spain).[5] They are decorated with carved wood and stucco, mosaic-tiled walls, and marble columns.[70] Behind these pavilions are extensions of the main prayer hall divided into four naves by rows of arches.[5] The gallery and arched hall on the northeastern sides of the courtyard are a prayer space reserved for women.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Minaret[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nView of the minaret from the east\n![](image)\nView from the south, with the unusual vertically-elongated lobed window visible\n\nThe minaret was constructed in the 10th century under the sponsorship of the Umayyad caliph of Córdoba, Abd al-Rahman III.[75] It overlooks the courtyard from the west. Along with the contemporary minaret of the Mosque of the Andalusians, it is the oldest preserved minaret in Morocco.[60]: 126 It was constructed in local limestone of relatively poor quality and was covered in whitewash by the Marinids in the 13th century in order to protect it from deterioration. It has a square shaft and is topped by a dome, as well as a parapet from which the muezzin historically issued the call to prayer (*adhan*). The full structure is 26.75 meters tall.[5] One feature of the minaret is the lower window on its southern facade, which is shaped like a \"triple\" horseshoe arch, elongated vertically, which is unique to this structure.[60] On the minaret's southern side, just above the gallery of the courtyard, is the Dar al-Muwaqqit.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Funerary annex (*Jama' al-Gnaiz*)[edit]\n\n\nA number of annexes are attached around the mosque, serving various functions. The northwestern edge of the building is occupied by latrines.[5] Behind the southern *qibla* wall, to the west of the *mihrab* axis, is the *Jama' al-Gnaiz*, which served as a separate oratory reserved for funerary rites. This type of facility was not particularly common in the Islamic world but there are several examples in Fez, including at the Chrabliyine and Bab Guissa Mosques. It was kept separate from the main mosque to preserve the purity of the latter as a regular prayer space, which could be soiled by the presence of a dead body.[5][62] This oratory dates back to the Almoravid period and also features embellishments such as a *muqarnas* cupola and a number of ornate archways in varying forms.[5][62] Spoliated capitals from al-Andalus are also re-used here in the doorways leading from the prayer hall to the funerary annex and in the columns supporting the *muqarnas* cupola.[62]: 60\n\n\n\n#### Library[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nView into the modern reading room (قاعة المطالعة) of the Qarawiyyin library\n\nBehind the southern wall of the mosque and east of the *mihrab* axis is the historic library of the mosque and university.[5] It is sometimes cited as the world's oldest library that remains open.[34]: 147[76][77] The first purpose-built library structure was added to the mosque by the Marinid sultan Abu Inan Faris in 1349 CE, though it was located at the mosque's northeastern corner instead of to the south.[78][5] The first structure still exists embedded near the women's section of the mosque, and consists of a square chamber measuring 5.4 meters per side. Its entrance is covered by a wooden screen from the Marinid period which features an inscription carved in cursive Arabic above the doorway recording Abu Inan's foundation of the library.[5]: 64\n\n\nThe current library building dates in part from a Saadian construction by Ahmad al-Mansur (late 16th century), who built a chamber called *al-Ahmadiyya* behind the *qibla* wall.[40] Most of the building dates from a major 20th-century expansion commissioned by King Mohammed V that started in 1940. It included the current grand reading room, which measures 23 metres long and features an ornately-painted wooden ceiling, and also added an entrance outside the mosque which made it accessible to non-Muslims.[40][39] This new library expansion was inaugurated in 1949.[72] The library complex underwent another major restoration in recent years led by Aziza Chaouni and was set to reopen in 2016 or 2017.[79][76][77][80]\n\n\n\n## Status as world's oldest university[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Madrasa § Madrasa and university\n\nUNESCO has previously described al-Qarawiyyin to be the \"oldest university in the world\" in the World Heritage Sites entry for Medina of Fez.[13] UNESCO describes the University of Bologna (founded in 1088 and usually recognized as the oldest medieval European university) as the \"oldest university of the Western world\".[81] Some historians and scholars also refer to al-Qarawiyyin as the world's oldest existing university.[34]: 137[82][83][44][84][85] The claim is also published by the *Guinness World Records*, under its entry for \"[o]ldest higher-learning institution, oldest university\", where it describes al-Qarawiyyin as the \"oldest existing, and continually operating educational institution in the world\", while the University of Bologna is described as the \"oldest one in Europe\".[86] Similarly, the *Encyclopædia Britannica* dates al-Qarawiyyin University's foundation to the mosque's foundation in 859[87] and generally considers that \"universities\" existed outside Europe before the advent of the European university model.[88] Other sources also refer to the historical or pre-modern al-Qarawiyyin as a \"university\" or an \"Islamic university\".[89][90]\n\n\nMany scholars consider the term *university* to be applicable only to the educational institutions that initially took form in medieval Christian Europe, and argue that the first universities were located in Western Europe, with those of Paris and Bologna often cited as the earliest examples.[91][92][93][94][95][96][97] The modern Western university model is thus widely argued to descend from this European tradition, even if other models of higher education existed in other parts of the world.[97][88][98] Jacques Verger says that while the term *university* is occasionally applied by scholars to madrasas and other pre-modern higher learning institutions out of convenience, the European university marked a major disruption between earlier institutions of higher learning and was the earliest true modern university.[11] Many scholars consider that the university was only adopted outside the West, including into the Islamic world, in the course of modernization programs or under European colonial regimes since the beginning of the 19th century.[99][100][11][101]\n\n\nAmong opposing views, Yahya Pallavicini claims that the university model did not spread in Europe until the 12th century and that it was found throughout the Muslim world from the founding of al-Qarawiyyin in the 9th century until at least European colonialism.[82] Some scholars, noting certain parallels between such madrasas and European medieval universities, have proposed that the latter may have been influenced by the madrasas of the Muslim world, in particular via Islamic Spain and the Emirate of Sicily.[102][103][104] Other scholars have questioned this, citing the lack of evidence for an actual transmission from the Islamic world to Christian Europe and highlighting the differences in the structure, methodologies, procedures, curricula and legal status of the madrasa versus the European university.[105][106]\n\n\nSome scholars consider that al-Qarawiyyin operated essentially as an Islamic madrasa until after World War II.[6][3][7][8][9] These scholars date al-Qarawiyyin's transformation into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.[3][1][2] In the wake of these reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" two years later.[1] Organization at the pre-modern al-Qarawiyyin differed from European universities and other Muslim institutions at al-Azhar (in Cairo) and al-Zaytouna (in Tunis) in that there was no defined scholastic year, registration was not imposed, study durations were not fixed, and there was no examination to ratify studies.[30] Students were expected to attend courses for a minimum of five years and would receive an *ijazah* if they were proven to have reached a high level of expertise.[22]: 457[30][102][43]\n\n\nThe earliest date of formal teaching at al-Qarawiyyin is also uncertain.[30][22] The most relevant major historical texts like the *Rawd al-Qirtas* and the *Zahrat al-As* do not provide clear details on the history of teaching at the mosque.[22]: 453 In the *Rawd al-Qirtas*, Ibn Abi Zar mentions the mosque but not its educational function. Al-Jazna'i, the 14th-century author of the *Zahrat al-As*, mentions that teaching had taken place there well before his time, but with no other details.[31]: 175 Otherwise, the earliest mentions of *halaqa* for learning and teaching may not have been until the 10th or the 12th century.[32][26] Moroccan historian Mohammed Al-Manouni believes that it was during the reign of the Almoravids (1040–1147) that the mosque acquired its function as a teaching institution.[30] French historian Évariste Lévi-Provençal dates the beginning of the madrasa and teaching to the later Marinid period (1244–1465).[33] Another Moroccan historian, Abdelhadi Tazi, indicated the earliest evidence of teaching at al-Qarawiyyin in 1121.[25] Upon reviewing the evidence in Abdelhadi Tazi's work, Abdul Latif Tibawi states that:\n\n\n\n\n> This is considerably later than the beginning of instruction at the al-Azhar under the Fatimids. So it is very difficult to sustain the claim that the University of Qarawiyyin is the \"oldest university\", and not only in the Muslim world! The mosque school or college did not assume the name of university until 1960 when in a ceremony Muhammad V invested it with that dignified title.[107]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nA number of well-known philosophers, scholars, and politicians in the history of Morocco and the western Mediterranean have either studied or taught at the Qarawiyyin since its founding.\n\n\n\n* Maimonides (1135/1138–1204), Jewish philosopher[1][108][109][110]\n* Ibn Arabi (1165–1240), Sufi philosopher[108][109]\n* Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406), historian and philosopher[1][108][37][109]\n* Leo Africanus (1494–1554), author[108]\n* Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari (1632-1577), historian and theologian, appointed imam and mufti by the Saadi Sultan Zaydan[111]\n* Imam al-Bannani (1727–1780), faqīh (Muslim jurist)[*citation needed*]\n* Ahmad ibn Idris (1760–1837), Moroccan Sufi scholar[112]\n* Muhammad al-Kattani (1873–1909), writer and political leader[113]\n* Abd el-Krim el-Khattabi (1882–1963), Rifian-Moroccan political and military leader[114]\n* Allal al-Fassi (1910–1974), Moroccan politician[115]\n* Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali (1893–1987), translator[116]\n* Abdullah al-Ghumari (1910–1993), faqīh (Muslim jurist)[117]\n* Fatima al-Kabbaj (1932–), Member of High Council of Knowledge [ar] (Islamic council) Notably, one of the first few women to be admitted.[15]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Morocco portal\n\n\n* List of Islamic educational institutions\n* List of universities in Morocco\n* Education in Morocco\n* History of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** One single plate from *Bab al-Gna'iz* is also kept by the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris.[60]: 56\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** Lulat, Y.

It was founded as a mosque in Fès in the middle of the ninth century. It has been a destination for students and scholars of Islamic sciences and Arabic studies throughout the history of Morocco. There were also other religious schools like the madras of ibn yusuf and other schools in the sus. This system of basic education called al-ta'lim al-aSil was funded by the sultans of Morocco and many famous traditional families. After independence, al-qarawiyin maintained its reputation, but it seemed important to transform it into a university that would prepare graduates for a modern country while maintaining an emphasis on Islamic studies. Hence, al-qarawiyin university was founded in February 1963 and, while the dean's residence was kept in Fès, the new university initially had four colleges located in major regions of the country known for their religious influences and madrasas. These colleges were kuliyat al-shari's in Fès, kuliyat uSul al-din in Tétouan, kuliyat al-lugha al-'arabiya in Marrakech (all founded in 1963), and kuliyat al-shari'a in Ait Melloul near Agadir, which was founded in 1979.\n> \n>\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Belhachmi, Zakia (2008). *Women, Education, and Science within the Arab-Islamic Socio-Cultural History: Legacies for Social Change*.

In terms of structure, the adjustments were twofold: the reorganization of the available original madaris, and the creation of new institutions. This resulted in three different types of Islamic teaching institutions in al-Maghrib. The first type was derived from the fusion of old madaris with new universities. For example, Morocco transformed Al-Qarawiyin (859 A.D) into a university under the supervision of the ministry of education in 1963.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Petersen, Andrew: *Dictionary of Islamic Architecture*, Routledge, 1996, ISBN 978-0-415-06084-4, p. 87 (entry \"Fez\"): \n> The Quaraouiyine Mosque, founded in 859, is the most famous mosque of Morocco and attracted continuous investment by Muslim rulers.\n> \n>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** ***ac*** ***ad*** ***ae*** ***af*** ***ag*** ***ah*** ***ai*** ***aj*** ***ak*** ***al*** ***am*** ***an*** ***ao*** ***ap*** ***aq*** ***ar*** ***as*** ***at*** ***au*** ***av*** ***aw*** ***ax*** ***ay*** ***az*** ***ba*** ***bb*** ***bc*** ***bd*** ***be*** ***bf*** ***bg*** ***bh*** ***bi*** ***bj*** ***bk*** ***bl*** ***bm*** ***bn*** ***bo*** ***bp*** Terrasse, Henri (1968). *La Mosquée al-Qaraouiyin à Fès; avec une étude de Gaston Deverdun sur les inscriptions historiques de la mosquée*.

For example many madrasah teachers are versed in Islamic pedagogy but also in modern university pedagogic developments such as behaviourist, cognitivist and the more recent constructivist styles. Al-Qarawiyyin University, in Morocco, represents such an institution that is grounded in a traditional madrasah education but for example, continues to adopt ancillary subjects and modern technologies such as mobile learning.\n10. **^** Makdisi, George: \"Madrasa and University in the Middle Ages\", *Studia Islamica*, No. 32 (1970), pp. 255–264 (255f.): \n> In studying an institution which is foreign and remote in point of time, as is the case of the medieval madrasa, one runs the double risk of attributing to it characteristics borrowed from one's own institutions and one's own times. Thus gratuitous transfers may be made from one culture to the other, and the time factor may be ignored or dismissed as being without significance. One cannot, therefore, be too careful in attempting a comparative study of these two institutions: the madrasa and the university. But in spite of the pitfalls inherent in such a study, albeit sketchy, the results which may be obtained are well worth the risks involved. In any case, one cannot avoid making comparisons when certain unwarranted statements have already been made and seem to be currently accepted without question. The most unwarranted of these statements is the one which makes of the \"madrasa\" a \"university\".\n> \n>\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Verger, Jacques: \"Patterns\", in: Ridder-Symoens, Hilde de (ed.): *A History of the University in Europe.

It is no doubt true that other civilizations, prior to, or wholly alien to, the medieval West, such as the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Islam, or China, were familiar with forms of higher education which a number of historians, for the sake of convenience, have sometimes described as universities. Yet a closer look makes it plain that the institutional reality was altogether different and, no matter what has been said on the subject, there is no real link such as would justify us in associating them with medieval universities in the West. Until there is definite proof to the contrary, these latter must be regarded as the sole source of the model which gradually spread through the whole of Europe and then to the whole world. We are therefore concerned with what is indisputably an original institution, which can only be defined in terms of a historical analysis of its emergence and its mode of operation in concrete circumstances.\n> \n>\n12. **^** \"Oldest higher-learning institution, oldest university\". *Guinness World Records*.

These centres were places where teachers and students of that time would meet and also where all intellectuals would gather and take part in extremely important scientific debates. It is not a coincidence that around the 9th century the first university in the world, the Qarawiyyin University in Fez, was established in the Muslim world followed by az-Zaytuna in Tunis and Al-Azhar in Cairo. The university model, which in the West was widespread starting only from the 12th century, had an extraordinary fortune and was spread throughout the Muslim world at least until the colonial period.\n83. **^** Hardaker, Glenn; Ahmad Sabki, A'ishah (2012). \"An insight into Islamic pedagogy at the University of al-Qarawiyyin\". *Multicultural Education & Technology Journal*. **6** (2): 106–110. doi:10.1108/17504971211236308.\n84. **^** Gathiram, Prem; Hänninen, Osmo (2014). \"Medicine and medical sciences in Africa\". *Pathophysiology*. **21** (2): 129–133. doi:10.1016/j.pathophys.2013.11.003.

There are various reasons for this assertion. As a community of teachers and taught, accorded certain rights, such as administrative autonomy and the determination and realization of curricula (courses of study) and of the objectives of research as well as the award of publicly recognized degrees, it is a creation of medieval Europe, which was the Europe of papal Christianity...\n> \n> \n> No other European institution has spread over the entire world in the way in which the traditional form of the European university has done. The degrees awarded by European universities – the bachelor's degree, the licentiate, the master's degree, and the doctorate – have been adopted in the most diverse societies throughout the world. The four medieval faculties of *artes* – variously called philosophy, letters, arts, arts and sciences, and humanities –, law, medicine, and theology have survived and have been supplemented by numerous disciplines, particularly the social sciences and technological studies, but they remain nonetheless at the heart of universities throughout the world.\n> \n> \n> Even the name of the *Universitas*, which in the Middle Ages was applied to corporate bodies of the most diverse sorts and was accordingly applied to the corporate organization of teachers and students, has in the course of centuries been given a more particular focus: the university, as a *universitas litterarum*, has since the eighteenth century been the intellectual institution which cultivates and transmits the entire corpus of methodically studied intellectual disciplines.\n> \n>\n101. **^** Sanz, Nuria; Bergan, Sjur (eds.): *The Heritage of European Universities*, Council of Europe, 2002, ISBN 978-92-871-4960-2, p. 119: \n> In many respects, if there is any institution that Europe can most justifiably claim as one of its inventions, it is the university.

It was founded as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri in 857–859 and subsequently became one of the leading spiritual and educational centers of the Islamic Golden Age. It was incorporated into Morocco's modern state university system in 1963 and officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" two years later.[1] The mosque building itself is also a significant complex of historical Moroccan and Islamic architecture that features elements from many different periods of Moroccan history.[5]\n\n\nScholars consider al-Qarawiyyin to have been effectively run as a madrasa until after World War II.[6][3][7][8][9] Many scholars distinguish this status from the status of \"university\", which they view as a distinctly European invention.[10][11] They date al-Qarawiyyin's transformation from a madrasa into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.[1][2][3] Some sources, such as UNESCO and the *Guinness World Records*, have cited al-Qarawiyyin as the oldest university or oldest continually operating higher learning institution in the world.[12][13]\n\n\nEducation at the University of al-Qarawiyyin concentrates on the Islamic religious and legal sciences with a heavy emphasis on, and particular strengths in, Classical Arabic grammar/linguistics and *Maliki* Sharia, though lessons on non-Islamic subjects are also offered to students. Teaching is still delivered in the traditional methods.[14] The university is attended by students from all over Morocco and Muslim West Africa, with some also coming from further abroad. Women were first admitted to the institution in the 1940s.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe Arabic name of the university, جَامِعَةُ الْقَرَوِيِّينَ pronounced [ʒaːmiʕtu lqarawijiːn] means \"University of the People from Kairouan (القَيْرَوَان [alqajrawaːn])\". Factors such as the provenance of Fatima al-Fihriya's family in Tunisia,[16] the presence of the letter *Qāf* (ق) – a voiceless uvular plosive which has no equivalent in European languages – the ويّي ([awijiː]) triphthong in the university's name, and the French colonization of Morocco have resulted in a number of different orthographies for the romanization of the university's name, including *al-Qarawiyyin*, a standard anglicization; *Al Quaraouiyine*, following French orthography; and *Al-Karaouine*, another rendering using French orthography.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qarawiyyin Mosque on the skyline of central Fes el-Bali: the green-tiled roofs of the prayer hall and the minaret (white tower on the left) are visible.\n### Foundation of the mosque[edit]\n\n\nIn the 9th century, Fez was the capital of the Idrisid dynasty, considered to be the first Moroccan Islamic state.[17] According to one of the major early sources on this period, the *Rawd al-Qirtas* by Ibn Abi Zar, al-Qarawiyyin was founded as a mosque in 857 or 859 by Fatima al-Fihri, the daughter of a wealthy merchant named Mohammed al-Fihri.[18][4][19][6][20][5]: 9[21]: 40 The al-Fihri family had migrated from Kairouan (hence the name of the mosque), Tunisia to Fez in the early 9th century, joining a community of other migrants from Kairouan who had settled in a western district of the city. Fatima and her sister Mariam, both of whom were well educated, inherited a large amount of money from their father. Fatima vowed to spend her entire inheritance to build a mosque suitable for her community.[22]: 48–49 Similarly, her sister Mariam is also reputed to have founded al-Andalusiyyin Mosque the same year.[23][22]\n\n\nThis foundation narrative has been questioned by some modern historians who see the symmetry of two sisters founding the two most famous mosques of Fez as too convenient and likely originating from a legend.[22]: 48–49[24][21]: 42 Ibn Abi Zar is also judged by contemporary historians to be a relatively unreliable source.[24] One of the biggest challenges to this story is a foundation inscription that was rediscovered during renovations to the mosque in the 20th century, previously hidden under layers of plaster for centuries. This inscription, carved onto cedar wood panels and written in a Kufic script very similar to foundation inscriptions in 9th-century Tunisia, was found on a wall above the probable site of the mosque's original *mihrab* (prior to the building's later expansions). The inscription, recorded and deciphered by Gaston Deverdun, proclaims the foundation of \"this mosque\" (Arabic: \"هذا المسجد\") by Dawud ibn Idris (a son of Idris II who governed this region of Morocco at the time) in *Dhu al-Qadah* 263 AH (July–August of 877 CE).[14] Deverdun suggested the inscription may have come from another unidentified mosque and was moved here at a later period (probably 15th or 16th century) when the veneration of the Idrisids was resurgent in Fez, and such relics would have held enough religious significance to be reused in this way.[14] However, Chafik Benchekroun argued more recently that a more likely explanation is that this inscription is the original foundation inscription of al-Qarawiyyin itself and that it might have been covered up in the 12th century just before the Almohads' arrival in the city.[24] Based on this evidence and on the many doubts about Ibn Abi Zar's narrative, he argues that Fatima al-Fihri is quite possibly a legendary figure rather than a historical one.[24]\n\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nSome scholars suggest that some teaching and instruction probably took place at al-Qarawiyyin Mosque from a very early period[25][22]: 453 or from its beginning.[26]: 287[1]: 71[27] Major mosques in the early Islamic period were typically multi-functional buildings where teaching and education took place alongside other religious and civic activities.[28][29] The al-Andalusiyyin Mosque, in the district across the river, may have also served a similar role up until at least the Marinid period, though it never equaled the Qarawiyyin's later prestige.[22]: 453 It is unclear at what time al-Qarawiyyin began to act more formally as an educational institution, partly because of the limited historical sources that pertain to its early period.[26][30][22] The most relevant major historical texts like the *Rawd al-Qirtas* by Ibn Abi Zar and the *Zahrat al-As* by Abu al-Hasan Ali al-Jazna'i do not provide any clear details on the history of teaching at the mosque,[22]: 453 though al-Jazna'i (who lived in the 14th century) mentions that teaching had taken place there before his time.[31]: 175 Otherwise, the earliest mentions of *halaqa* (circles) for learning and teaching may not have been until the 10th or the 12th century.[32][26] Historian Abdelhadi Tazi indicates the earliest clear evidence of teaching at al-Qarawiyyin in 1121.[25]: 112 Moroccan historian Mohammed Al-Manouni believes that the mosque acquired its function as a teaching institution during the reign of the Almoravids (1040–1147).[30] Historian Évariste Lévi-Provençal dates the beginning of teaching to the Marinid period (1244–1465).[33]\n\n\nIn the 10th century, the Idrisid dynasty fell from power and Fez was contested between the Fatimid and Córdoban Umayyad caliphates and their allies.[17] During this period, the Qarawiyyin Mosque progressively grew in prestige. At some point the *khutba* (Friday sermon) was transferred from the Shurafa Mosque of Idris II (today the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II) to the Qarawiyyin Mosque, granting it the status of Friday mosque (the community's main mosque). This transfer happened either in 919 or in 933, both dates that correspond to brief periods of Fatimid domination over the city, and suggests that the transfer may have occurred by Fatimid initiative.[5]: 12 The mosque and its learning institution continued to enjoy the respect of political elites, with the mosque itself being significantly expanded by the Almoravids and repeatedly embellished under subsequent dynasties.[5] Tradition was established that all the other mosques in Fez based the timing of their call to prayer (*adhan*) according to that of al-Qarawiyyin.[34]\n\n\n\n### Apogee during the Marinid period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Reconstruction of the 14th-century water clock from the *dar al-muwaqqit* of the Qarawiyyin Mosque (on display at the Istanbul Museum of the History of Science and Technology in Islam)\nMany scholars consider al-Qarawiyyin's high point as an intellectual and scholarly center to be in the 13th and 14th centuries, when the curriculum was at its broadest and its prestige had reached new heights after centuries of expansion and elite patronage.[1][34][30]: 141 Among the subjects taught around this period or shortly after were traditional religious subjects such as the Quran and *fiqh* (Islamic jurisprudence), and other sciences like grammar, rhetoric, logic, medicine, mathematics, astronomy and geography.[30][26][1][22]: 455 By contrast, some subjects like alchemy/chemistry were never officially taught as they were considered too unorthodox.[22]: 455\n\n![](image)The Al-Attarine Madrasa (founded in 1323), just north of the Qarawiyyin MosqueStarting in the late 13th century, and especially in the 14th century, the Marinid dynasty was responsible for constructing a number of formal madrasas in the areas around al-Qarawiyyin's main building. The first of these was the Saffarin Madrasa in 1271, followed by al-Attarine in 1323, and the Mesbahiya Madrasa in 1346.[35] A larger but much later madrasa, the Cherratine Madrasa, was also built nearby in 1670.[36] These madrasas taught their own courses and sometimes became well-known institutions, but they usually had narrower curricula or specializations.[34]: 141[37] One of their most important functions seems to have been to provide housing for students from other towns and cities – many of them poor – who needed a place to stay while studying at al-Qarawiyyin.[38]: 137[34]: 110[22]: 463 Thus, these buildings acted as complimentary or auxiliary institutions to al-Qarawiyyin itself, which remained the center of intellectual life in the city.\n\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin also compiled a large selection of manuscripts that were kept at a library founded by the Marinid sultan Abu Inan Faris in 1349.[5][39] The collection housed numerous works from the Maghreb, al-Andalus, and the Middle East.[40] Part of the collection was gathered decades earlier by Sultan Abu Yusuf Ya'qub (ruled 1258–1286), who persuaded Sancho IV of Castile to hand over a number of works from the libraries of Seville, Córdoba, Almeria, Granada, and Malaga in al-Andalus/Spain. Abu Yusuf initially housed these in the nearby Saffarin Madrasa (which he had recently built), but later moved them to al-Qarawiyyin.[40] Among the most precious manuscripts currently housed in the library are volumes from the *Al-Muwatta* of Malik written on gazelle parchment,[41] a copy of the *Sirat* by Ibn Ishaq,[41] a 9th-century Quran manuscript (also written on gazelle parchment),[34]: 148 a copy of the Quran given by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur in 1602,[41] a copy of Ibn Rushd's *Al-Bayan Wa-al-Tahsil wa-al-Tawjih* (a commentary on *Maliki* *fiqh*) dating from 1320,[42][34]: 143 and the original copy of Ibn Khaldun's book *Al-'Ibar* (including the *Muqaddimah*) gifted by the author in 1396.[41][37] Recently rediscovered in the library is an *ijazah* certificate, written on deer parchment, which some scholars claim to be the oldest surviving predecessor of a Medical Doctorate degree, issued to a man called Abdellah Ben Saleh Al Koutami in 1207 CE under the authority of three other doctors and in the presence of the chief *qadi* (judge) of the city and two other witnesses.[43][44] The library was managed by a *qayim* or conservator, who oversaw the maintenance of the collection.[34]: 143[40] By 1613 one conservator estimated the library's collection at 32,000 volumes.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)A document from the Qarawiyyin's library which is claimed by some scholars to be the world's oldest surviving medical degree, issued in 1207 CE\nStudents were male, but traditionally it has been said that \"facilities were at times provided for interested women to listen to the discourse while accommodated in a special gallery (*riwaq*) overlooking the scholars' circle\".[26] The 12th-century cartographer Mohammed al-Idrisi, whose maps aided European exploration during the Renaissance, is said to have lived in Fez for some time, suggesting that he may have worked or studied at al-Qarawiyyin. The institution has produced numerous scholars who have strongly influenced the intellectual and academic history of the Muslim world. Among them are Ibn Rushayd al-Sabti (d. 1321), Mohammed Ibn al-Hajj al-Abdari al-Fasi (d. 1336), Abu Imran al-Fasi (d. 1015) – a leading theorist of the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, and Leo Africanus. Pioneer scholars such as Muhammad al-Idrissi (d.1166 AD), Ibn al-Arabi (1165–1240 AD), Ibn Khaldun (1332–1395 AD), Ibn al-Khatib (d. 1374), Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji (Alpetragius) (d. 1294), and Ali ibn Hirzihim (d. 1163) were all connected with al-Qarawiyyin as either students or lecturers.[41] Some Christian scholars visited al-Qarawiyyin, including Nicolas Cleynaerts (d. 1542)[45][34]: 252 and the Jacobus Golius (d. 1667).[41] The 19th-century orientalist Jousé Ponteleimon Krestovitich also claimed that Gerbert d'Aurillac (later Pope Sylvester II) studied at al-Qarawiyyin in the 10th century.[46][34]: 138 Although this claim about Gerbert is sometimes repeated by modern authors,[20][47] modern scholarship has not produced evidence to support this story.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Decline and reforms[edit]\n\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin underwent a general decline in later centuries along with Fez. The strength of its teaching stagnated and its curriculum decreased in range and scope, becoming focused on traditional Islamic sciences and Arabic linguistic studies. Even some traditional Islamic specializations like *tafsir* (Quranic exegesis) were progressively neglected or abandoned.[1][30] In 1788–89, the Alaouite sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah introduced reforms that regulated the institution's program, but also imposed stricter limits and excluded logic, philosophy, and the more radical Sufi texts from the curriculum.[26][30][50] Other subjects also disappeared over time, such as astronomy and medicine.[30] In 1845 Sultan Abd al-Rahman carried out further reforms, but it is unclear if this had any significant long-term effects.[1][30] Between 1830 and 1906 the number of faculty decreased from 425 to 266 (of which, among the latter, only 101 were still teaching).[1]: 71\n\n\nBy the 19th century, the mosque's library also suffered from decline and neglect.[30][40] A significant portion of its collection was lost over time, most likely due to lax supervision and to books that were not returned.[22]: 472 By the beginning of the 20th century, the collection had been reduced to around 1,600 manuscripts and 400 printed books, though many valuable historic items were retained.[30]\n\n\n\n### 20th century and transformation into state university[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qarawiyyin Mosque in 1916\nAt the time Morocco became a French protectorate in 1912, al-Qarawiyyin worsened as a religious center of learning from its medieval prime,[1] though it retained some significance as an educational venue for the sultan's administration.[1] The student body was rigidly divided along social strata: ethnicity (Arab or Berber), social status, personal wealth, and geographic background (rural or urban) determined the group membership of the students who were segregated by the teaching facility, as well as in their personal quarters.[1] The French administration implemented a number of structural reforms between 1914 and 1947, including the institution of calendars, appointment of teachers, salaries, schedules, general administration, and the replacement of the *ijazah* with the *shahada alamiyha,* but did not modernize the contents of teaching likewise which were still dominated by the traditional worldviews of the *ulama*.[1] At the same time, the student numbers at al-Qarawiyyin decreased to 300 in 1922 as the Moroccan elite sent their children to the newly founded Western-style colleges and institutes elsewhere in the country.[1] In 1931 and 1933, on the orders of Muhammad V, al-Qarawiyyin's teaching was reorganized into elementary, secondary, and higher education.[30][26][50]\n\n\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin also played a role in the Moroccan nationalist movement and in protests against the French colonial regime. Many Moroccan nationalists had received their education here and some of their informal political networks were established due to the shared educational background.[51]: 140, 146 In July 1930, al-Qarawiyyin strongly participated in the propagation of *Ya Latif*, a communal prayer recited in times of calamity, to raise awareness and opposition to the Berber Dahir decreed by the French authorities two months earlier.[52][51]: 143–144 In 1937 the mosque was one of the rallying points (along with the nearby R'cif mosque) for demonstrations in response to a violent crackdown on Moroccan protesters in Meknes, which ended with French troops being deployed across Fes el-Bali and at the mosques.[17]: 387–389[51]: 168\n\n![](image)The main entrance to the library and other southern annexes of the mosque today, off Place SeffarineIn 1947 al-Qarawiyyin was integrated into the state educational system,[7] and women were first admitted to study there during the 1940s.[15] In 1963, after Moroccan independence, al-Qarawiyyin was officially transformed by royal decree into a university under the supervision of the ministry of education.[1][53][2] Classes at the old mosque ceased and a new campus was established at a former French Army barracks.[1] While the dean took his seat at Fez, four faculties were founded in and outside the city: a faculty of Islamic law in Fez, a faculty of Arab studies in Marrakech, and two faculties of theology in Tétouan and near Agadir. Modern curricula and textbooks were introduced and the professional training of the teachers improved.[1][54] Following the reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" in 1965.[1]\n\n\nIn 1975, General Studies was transferred to the newly founded Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University; al-Qarawiyyin kept the Islamic and theological courses of studies.[*citation needed*] In 1973, Abdelhadi Tazi published a three-volume history of the establishment entitled جامع القرويين (*The al-Qarawiyyin Mosque*).[55]\n\n\nIn 1988, after a hiatus of almost three decades, the teaching of traditional Islamic education at al-Qarawiyyin was resumed by King Hassan II in what has been interpreted as a move to bolster conservative support for the monarchy.[1]\n\n\n\n## Education and curriculum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Scholar at the Al-Qarawiyyin library\nEducation at al-Qarawiyyin University concentrates on the Islamic religious and legal sciences with a heavy emphasis on, and particular strengths in, Classical Arabic grammar/linguistics and Maliki law, though some lessons on other non-Islamic subjects such as French and English are also offered to students.[56][57] Teaching is delivered with students seated in a semi-circle around a sheikh, who prompts them to read sections of a particular text; asks them questions on particular points of grammar, law, or interpretation; and explains difficult points. Students from Morocco and Islamic West Africa attend al-Qarawiyyin, though some come from Muslim Central Asia. Spanish Muslim converts frequently attend the institution, largely attracted by the fact that the sheikhs of al-Qarawiyyin, and Islamic scholarship in Morocco in general, are heirs to the rich, religious, and scholarly heritage of Muslim al-Andalus.[56]\n\n\nMost students at al-Qarawiyyin range are between 13 and 30 years old, and study towards high school-level diplomas and university-level bachelor's degrees, although Muslims with a sufficiently high level of Arabic can attend lecture circles on an informal basis, given the traditional category of visitors \"in search of [religious and legal] knowledge\" (\"zuwwaar li'l-talab fii 'ilm\"). In addition to being Muslim, prospective students of al-Qarawiyyin are required to have fully memorized the Quran, as well as other shorter medieval Islamic texts on grammar and *Maliki* law, and to be proficient in classical Arabic.[56][58]\n\n\n\n## Architecture of the mosque[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Floor plan of the mosque and some of its annexes. (Based on an early 20th-century survey; since then the southern part of the complex, the library, has been modified.)Al-Qarawiyyin Mosque was founded in the 9th century, but its present form is the result of a long historical evolution over the course of more than 1,000 years. Successive dynasties expanded the mosque until it became the largest in Africa, with a capacity of 22,000 worshipers.[59] The present-day mosque covers an extensive area of about half a hectare.[34]: 136 Broadly speaking, it consists of a large hypostyle interior space for prayers (the prayer hall), a courtyard with fountains (the *sahn*), a minaret at the courtyard's western end, and a number of annexes around the mosque itself.\n\n\n### Historical evolution[edit]\n\n\n#### Early history (9th–10th centuries)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arches in the prayer hall of the mosque\nThe original mosque building was built in the 9th century. A major modern study of the mosque's structure, published by French archeologist and historian Henri Terrasse in 1968, determined that traces of the original mosque could be found in the layout of the current building.[5]: 10 This initial form of the mosque occupied a large space immediately to the south of the *sahn*, in what is now the prayer hall.[5][60]: 119 It had a rectangular floor plan measuring 36 by 32 meters, covering an area of 1520 square meters, and was composed of a prayer hall with four transverse aisles running roughly east–west, parallel to the southern *qibla* wall.[5][34]: 135 It probably also had a courtyard of relatively small size, and the first minaret, also of small size, reportedly stood on the location now occupied by the wooden *anaza* (at the central entrance to the prayer hall from the courtyard).[5] Water for the mosque was initially provided by a well dug within the mosque's precinct.[5]\n\n\nAs Fez grew and the mosque increased in prestige, the original building was insufficient for its religious and institutional needs.[5][34] During the 10th century, the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba and the Fatimid Caliphate constantly fought for control over Fez and Morocco, seen as a buffer zone between the two.[17] Despite this uncertain period, the mosque received significant patronage and had its first expansions. The Zenata Berber emir Ahmed ibn Abi Said, one of the rulers of Fez during this period who was aligned with the Umayyads, wrote to the caliph Abd al-Rahman III in Córdoba for permission and funds to expand the mosque.[5] The caliph approved, and the work was carried out or completed in 956.[5] It expanded the mosque on three sides, encompassing the area of the present-day courtyard to the north and up to the current eastern and western boundaries of the building.[60] It also replaced the original minaret with a new, larger minaret still standing today. Its overall form, with a square shaft, was indicative of the subsequent development of Maghrebi and Andalusian minarets.[5][60]\n\n\nThe mosque was embellished when the Amirid ruler al-Muzaffar (son of al-Mansur) led a military expedition to Fez in 998. The embellishments included a new *minbar* and a dome topped by talismans in the shape of a rat, a serpent, and a scorpion.[5] Of these, only the dome itself, whose exterior is distinctively fluted or grooved, survives today, located above the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall. A similar dome, located across the courtyard over the northern entrance of the mosque (*Bab al-Ward* or \"Gate of the Rose\"), likely also dates from the same time.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Almoravid expansion (12th century)[edit]\n\n\nOne of the most significant expansions and renovations was carried out between 1135 and 1143 under the patronage of the Almoravid ruler Ali ibn Yusuf.[5] The prayer hall was extended by dismantling the existing southern wall and adding three more transverse aisles for a total of ten, while replicating the format of the existing arches of the mosque.[5][60] This expansion required the purchase and demolition of a number of neighboring houses and structures, including some that were apparently part of the nearby Jewish neighbourhood (before the Mellah of Fez).[5]\n\n\nThe new expansion of the mosque involved not only a new *mihrab* in the middle of the new southern wall, but also the reconstruction or embellishment of the prayer hall's central nave (the arches along its central axis, in a line perpendicular to the southern wall and to the other rows of arches) leading from the courtyard to the *mihrab*. This involved not only embellishing some of the arches with new forms but also adding a series of highly elaborate cupola ceilings composed in *muqarnas* (honeycomb or stalactite-like) sculpting and further decorated with intricate reliefs of arabesques and Kufic letters.[5][62] The craftsmen who worked on this expansion are mostly anonymous, except for two names that are carved on the bases of two of the cupolas: Ibrāhīm and Salāma ibn Mufarrij, who may have been of Andalusi origin.[62]: 76 Lastly, a new *minbar* in similar style and of similar artistic provenance as the *minbar* of the Koutoubia Mosque was completed and installed in 1144.[5] It is made of wood in an elaborate work of marquetry, and decorated with inlaid materials and intricately carved arabesque reliefs. Its style was emulated for later Moroccan minbars.[5][62]\n\n\nElsewhere, many of the mosque's main entrances were given doors made of wood overlaid with ornate bronze fittings, which today count among the oldest surviving bronze artworks in Moroccan architecture.[38][5] Another interesting element added to the mosque was a small secondary oratory, known as the *Jama' al-Gnaiz* (\"Funeral Mosque\" or \"Mosque of the Dead\"), which was separated from the main prayer hall and dedicated to providing funerary rites for the deceased before their burial.[5] The annex is also decorated with a *muqarnas* cupola and ornate archways and windows.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Almohad period (12th–13th centuries)[edit]\n\n\nLater dynasties continued to embellish the mosque or gift it with new furnishings, though no works as radical as the Almoravid expansion were undertaken again. The Almohads (later 12th century and 13th century) conquered Fez after a long siege in 1145–1146.[22][5] Historical sources (particularly the *Rawd al-Qirtas*) report a story claiming that the inhabitants of Fez, fearful that the \"puritan\" Almohads would resent the lavish decoration placed inside the mosque, used whitewash to cover up the most ornate decorations from Ibn Yusuf's expansion near the *mihrab.*[5]: 25–26 Terrasse suggests this operation may have actually been carried out a few years later by the Almohad authorities themselves.[5] The Almoravid ornamentation was only fully uncovered again during renovations in the early 20th century.[63][5] The plaster used to cover the Almoravid decoration seems to have been prepared too quickly and did not fully bond with the existing surface. This ended up making its removal easier during modern restorations and has helped to preserve much of the original Almoravid decoration now visible again today.[62]: 64\n\n\nUnder the reign of Muhammad al-Nasir (r. 1199–1213), the Almohads added and upgraded a number of elements in the mosque, some of which were nonetheless marked with strong decorative flourishes. The ablutions facilities in the courtyard were upgraded, a separate ablutions room was added to the north, and a new underground storage room was created.[5] They also replaced the mosque's grand chandelier with one made of bronze, which Terrasse described as \"the largest and most beautiful chandelier in the Islamic world,\" and which hangs in the central nave of the mosque today.[64][5][60][65] It was commissioned by Abu Muhammad 'Abd Allah ibn Musa, the *khatib* of the mosque during the years 1202 to 1219.[60]: 334 The chandelier has the shape of a 12-sided cupola surmounted by a large cone, around which are nine levels that hold candlesticks. It could originally hold 520 oil candles; the cost of providing the oil was so significant that it was only lit on special occasions, such as on the nights of Ramadan. The Marinid sultan Abu Ya'qub Yusuf (r. 1286–1307), upon seeing the cost, ordered that it only be lit for the last day of Ramadan. The visible surfaces of the chandelier are carved and pierced with intricate floral arabesque motifs as well as Kufic Arabic inscriptions. The chandelier is the oldest surviving chandelier in the western Islamic world, and it likely served as a model for the Marinid chandelier in the Great Mosque of Taza.[60]: 334\n\n\n\n#### Marinid period (13th–14th centuries)[edit]\n\n\nThe Marinids, who were responsible for building many of the madrasas around Fez, made various contributions to the mosque. In 1286 they restored and protected the 10th-century minaret, which had been made from deteriorating poor-quality stone with whitewash.[5] At its southern foot, they also built the *Dar al-Muwaqqit*, a chamber for the timekeeper (*muwaqqit*) of the mosque who was responsible for determining the precise times of prayer. The chamber was equipped with astrolabes and other scientific equipment of the era in order to aid in this task. Several water clocks were built for it in this period. The first two do not exist anymore, but are described by al-Jazna'i in the *Zahrat al-As*.[61] The first was commissioned by Abu Yusuf Ya'qub in the 13th century and designed by Muhammad ibn al-Habbak, a *faqih* and *muwaqqit*.[66][67] The second was built in 1317 or 1318 (717 AH), under the reign of Abu Sa'id, by a scholar named Abu Abdullah Muhammad al-Sanhaji. Its time divisions were engraved by Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn al-Saddina al-Qarsatuni. The clock was neglected then restored between 1346 and 1349 (747–749 AH) by a new *muwaqqit*, Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn al-'Arabi.[61][5]: 62[60]: 492 A third and final water clock, built on the orders of Sultan Abu Salim Ali II (ruled 1359–1361), is still partly preserved today.[60][68][69] It was designed by Abu Zayd Abd al-Rahman ibn Sulayman al-Laja'i and completed on November 20, 1361 (21 Muharram 763 AH), as recorded by an original inscription. It features a large astrolabe with a diameter of 71 cm, which is embedded into a wooden structure in the corner of the room, but its mechanism is no longer present.[61]\n\n* ![View of the Dar al-Muwaqqit, with its double-arched window overlooking the courtyard](image)\n\nView of the *Dar al-Muwaqqit*, with its double-arched window overlooking the courtyard\n* ![The astrolabe of the water clock device completed in 1361 by al-Laja'i](image)\n\nThe astrolabe of the water clock device completed in 1361 by al-Laja'i\n\nThe galleries around the *sahn* were also rebuilt or repaired in 1283 and 1296–97, while at the entrance from the courtyard to the prayer hall (leading to the central nave of the mihrab), a decorative wooden screen, called the *anaza,* was installed in 1289 and acted as a symbolic \"outdoor\" or \"summer\" mihrab for prayers in the courtyard.[5] The stucco decoration on the entrance arch itself, however, dates from much later.[61] At the central outer entrance to the courtyard from the north, the cupola ceiling over the entrance vestibule of the gate called *Bab al-Ward* (\"Gate of the Rose\") was redecorated with carved stucco in 1337.[5][61] The richly-sculpted archway on the inner side of the gate also dates from this time.[61]\n\n* ![Marinid decoration in the cupola over the vestibule of Bab al-Ward, the central northern gate of the mosque](image)\n\nMarinid decoration in the cupola over the vestibule of *Bab al-Ward*, the central northern gate of the mosque\n* ![Inner façade of Bab al-Ward, with Marinid-era stucco embellishment](image)\n\nInner façade of *Bab al-Ward*, with Marinid-era stucco embellishment\n* ![The wooden anaza at the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall](image)\n\nThe wooden *anaza* at the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall\n\nA number of ornate metal chandeliers hanging in the mosque's prayer hall date from the Marinid era. Three of them were made from church bells which Marinid craftsmen used as a base onto which they grafted ornate copper fittings. The largest of them, installed in the mosque in 1337, was a bell brought back from Gibraltar by the son of Sultan Abu al-Hasan, Abu Malik, after its reconquest from Spanish forces in 1333.[5]\n\n\nThe mosque's library was officially founded by Sultan Abu Inan in 1349 (750 AH), as dated by an inscription over its doorway.[5]: 64[20] This first Marinid library was located at the mosque's northeastern corner (as opposed to the library's current southern location).[20] In 1361, Sultan Abu Salim added a room to it, which was built above and over the adjacent street, and dedicated to readings of the Quran.[5]: 64\n\n\n\n#### Saadian and Alaouite period (16th-century to modern era)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the Saadian pavilions (late 16th and early 17th century) in the courtyard, featuring carved wood and stucco decoration\nThe Saadians embellished the mosque by adding two prominent pavilions to the western and eastern ends of the courtyard, each of which sheltered a new fountain. The Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur was responsible for building the first pavilion to the east in 1587–88, while the western pavilion was added by his grandson Abdallah al-Ghalib II in 1609.[70]: 100 The pavilions emulate the ones in the Court of Lions of the Alhambra palaces (in Granada, Spain).[5][70] Al-Mansur also built a new room for the library on the south side of the mosque (around the library's current location), which was connected to the mosque via a door in the *qibla* wall.[71][20]\n\n\nThe Alaouite dynasty, which has ruled Morocco from the 17th century onward, continued to perform minor additions and regular maintenance on the mosque. A ribbed cupola in the central nave, where the 1337 Marinid chandelier hangs, has been dated by Terrasse to the Alaouite period,[5] although Xavier Salmon has more recently argued that at least some elements of the dome seem to date from the Marinid era.[61] The stucco decoration of the central archway at the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall (i.e. the arch inside which the Marinid-era *anaza* stands) also dates from the Alaouite period; an inscription at the top of the arch gives the year 1864–1865 (1281 AH).[61]\n\n\nThe present library building dates mainly from a major expansion and modification in the 20th century, particularly in the 1940s.[20][71]: 174 The new library expansion, which included a large new reading room, was inaugurated in 1949.[72]\n\n\n\n### Current structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Exterior[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nDoors of Bab al-Gna'iz today, with replicas of the original Almoravid bronze overlays\n![](image)\nFragments of the original bronze overlays of Bab al-Gna'iz, dating to the Almoravid period\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin's exterior does not generally present a monumental appearance and is integrated with the dense urban fabric around it. By one count there are 18 separate gates and entrances distributed around its perimeter.[34] The gates vary from small rectangular doorways to enormous horseshoe arches with huge doors preceded by wooden roofs covering the street in front of them.[5] While the doors are generally made of wood, some of the gates have extensive ornate bronze overlays crafted during the Almoravid period.[5] The most ornate and best-preserved examples include the doors of the principal northern gate, *Bab al-Ward* (which opens onto the courtyard), the western gate called *Bab Sbitriyyin*, and the southwestern gate *Bab al-Gna'iz*, which leads to the *Jama' al-Gna'iz*.[5][62] While the doors of *Bab al-Ward* preserve original pieces and were restored in 2005–2007, the doors of *Bab al-Gna'iz* and *Bab Sbitriyyin* are replicas made in the 1950s that replaced the originals, whose fragments are kept by the Dar Batha Museum.[60]: 56[a] The northwestern gates of the mosque, *Bab al-Shama'in* (or *Bab Chemaine*) and *Bab al-Maqsura*, also have heavy bronze fittings, including some ornate knockers that date from the Almoravid period.[5]\n\n\nAdjacent to *Bab al-Ward*, on its west side, is another doorway, *Bab al-Hafa* (\"Gate of the Barefooted\"). This gate dates to the Almohad era. It is distinguished by a small water channel that runs across the floor just inside it. The channel allowed worshipers entering the mosque to wash their feet on the way in, helping with initial ablutions.[36][5]\n\n\nNext to the mosque is a tower known as the *Borj Neffara* (برج النفارة, \"Tower of the Trumpeters\"), an observation tower that is sometimes confused as a minaret but was actually part of another *Dar al-Muwaqqit*.[73][38]: 150\n\n\n\n#### Prayer hall[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nThe central nave of the mosque, leading towards the *mihrab*, with some of the Almohad and Marinid chandeliers visible\n![](image)\nThe *mihrab* (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer)\n\nThe interior hypostyle prayer hall takes up most of the mosque's area. Like the interior of most traditional mosques in Moroccan architecture, it is a relatively austere space with mostly plain walls, wooden roofs, and rows upon rows of arches. The main area, south of the courtyard, is a vast space divided into ten transverse aisles by rows of arches running parallel to the southern wall.[5] The southern wall of this hall also marks the *qibla*. The central axis of the prayer hall, perpendicular to the *qibla* wall, is marked by a central nave running between two extra lines of arches along this axis, perpendicular to the other arches.[5] This nave leads towards the *mihrab:* a niche in the *qibla* wall which symbolizes the direction of prayer, and in front of which the imam usually leads prayers and delivers sermons. This overall layout (a hypostyle hall with a central nave emphasized against the others) is a familiar layout for North African mosques generally.[5][71]\n\n\nThe *mihrab*, which dates from the Almoravid (12th-century) expansion, is decorated with carved and painted stucco, as well as several windows of coloured glass. The *mihrab* niche itself is a small alcove which is covered by a small dome of *muqarnas* (stalactite or honeycomb-like sculpting).[62] On each side of the *mihrab*'s opening is a pair of engaged marble columns topped by deeply-carved capitals. These capitals are spolia from al-Andalus, dating from the time of the Caliphate of Córdoba, which were re-appropriated by the Almoravids for Ali Ibn Yusuf's expansion of the mosque.[62]: 60 On the mihrab's façade, the stucco ornamentation of the lower parts, immediately around the arch itself, was most likely redone in the 16th and/or early 19th centuries. The stucco decoration of the upper wall above this still dates from the Almoravid period. The Almoravid decoration prioritizes floral motifs, which contain more diversity than the later restorations below, over which bands of Kufic inscriptions have also been carved.[62]: 72–76\n\n\nThe central nave that runs along the axis of the *mihrab* is distinguished from the rest of the mosque by a number of architectural embellishments. The arches that run along it are of varying shapes, including both horseshoe arches and multi-lobed arches.[5] Instead of the plain timber ceilings, most sections of the nave are covered by a series of intricate *muqarnas* ceilings and cupolas, each slightly different from the other, as well as two \"ribbed\" dome cupolas (similar to the domes of the Great Mosque of Córdoba and Cristo de la Luz Mosque in Toledo) dating from the Almoravid and Alaouite periods.[5] The muqarnas vaults are made of plaster and are suspended from a hidden framework of wooden struts above them.[21]: 119–120 Many of the *muqarnas* compositions are further embellished with intricate reliefs of arabesques and Arabic inscriptions in both Kufic and cursive letters, highlighted with blue and red colours.[5][62][21]: 119–120 Additionally, there are several elaborately carved bronze chandeliers hanging in the nave which were gifted to the mosque during the Almohad and Marinid eras; at least three of which were made from bells (probably church bells) brought back from victories in Spain.[5][74]\n\n\nTo the right of the *mihrab* is the *minbar* of the mosque, which could also be stored in a small room behind a door in the *qibla* wall. The *minbar* is most likely of similar origins as the Almoravid *minbar* of the Koutoubia Mosque, made by a workshop in Córdoba not long after the latter and installed in al-Qarawiyyin Mosque in 1144 (at the end of the Almoravid works on the mosque).[5] It is another exceptional work of marquetry and woodcarving, decorated with geometric compositions, inlaid materials, and arabesque reliefs.[5][62]\n\n\nAside from the embellishments of the central nave, the rest of the mosque is architecturally uniform, but there are some minor irregularities in the floor plan. For example, the arches in the western half of the prayer hall are shorter than those in the eastern half, and some of the transverse aisles are slightly wider than others. These anomalies have not been fully explained but they appear to have been present since the early centuries of the mosque; they may be due to early reconstructions or alterations which have gone unrecorded in historical chronicles.[5]\n\n\n\n#### *Sahn*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The courtyard (*sahn*) of the Qarawiyyin Mosque, including the central fountain and one of the Saadian-era pavilions\nThe *sahn* is rectangular, surrounded by the prayer hall on three sides and by a gallery to the north. The floor is paved with typical Moroccan mosaic tiles (*zellij*) and at the center is a fountain.[71] From outside the mosque, the courtyard is accessed by the main northern gate, called *Bab al-Ward*, whose vestibule is covered by a Marinid-era white dome which is fluted on the outside and covered in painted and carved stucco on the inside.[5] Opposite this gate, situated on the mihrab axis, is the central entrance to the interior prayer hall, guarded by a carved and painted wooden screen called the *anaza* which also acted as a symbolic \"outdoor\" or \"summer\" mihrab for prayers taking place in the courtyard.[5] (These features are visible to visitors standing outside the gate.) Both this entrance to the prayer hall and the outer gate across from it have facades decorated with carved and painted stucco.[5]\n\n\nAt the western and eastern ends of the courtyard stand two ornate Saadian pavilions each sheltering another fountain. The pavilions have pyramidal domes and emulate the pavilions in the Court of the Lions in the Alhambra (Spain).[5] They are decorated with carved wood and stucco, mosaic-tiled walls, and marble columns.[70] Behind these pavilions are extensions of the main prayer hall divided into four naves by rows of arches.[5] The gallery and arched hall on the northeastern sides of the courtyard are a prayer space reserved for women.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Minaret[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nView of the minaret from the east\n![](image)\nView from the south, with the unusual vertically-elongated lobed window visible\n\nThe minaret was constructed in the 10th century under the sponsorship of the Umayyad caliph of Córdoba, Abd al-Rahman III.[75] It overlooks the courtyard from the west. Along with the contemporary minaret of the Mosque of the Andalusians, it is the oldest preserved minaret in Morocco.[60]: 126 It was constructed in local limestone of relatively poor quality and was covered in whitewash by the Marinids in the 13th century in order to protect it from deterioration. It has a square shaft and is topped by a dome, as well as a parapet from which the muezzin historically issued the call to prayer (*adhan*). The full structure is 26.75 meters tall.[5] One feature of the minaret is the lower window on its southern facade, which is shaped like a \"triple\" horseshoe arch, elongated vertically, which is unique to this structure.[60] On the minaret's southern side, just above the gallery of the courtyard, is the Dar al-Muwaqqit.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Funerary annex (*Jama' al-Gnaiz*)[edit]\n\n\nA number of annexes are attached around the mosque, serving various functions. The northwestern edge of the building is occupied by latrines.[5] Behind the southern *qibla* wall, to the west of the *mihrab* axis, is the *Jama' al-Gnaiz*, which served as a separate oratory reserved for funerary rites. This type of facility was not particularly common in the Islamic world but there are several examples in Fez, including at the Chrabliyine and Bab Guissa Mosques. It was kept separate from the main mosque to preserve the purity of the latter as a regular prayer space, which could be soiled by the presence of a dead body.[5][62] This oratory dates back to the Almoravid period and also features embellishments such as a *muqarnas* cupola and a number of ornate archways in varying forms.[5][62] Spoliated capitals from al-Andalus are also re-used here in the doorways leading from the prayer hall to the funerary annex and in the columns supporting the *muqarnas* cupola.[62]: 60\n\n\n\n#### Library[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nView into the modern reading room (قاعة المطالعة) of the Qarawiyyin library\n\nBehind the southern wall of the mosque and east of the *mihrab* axis is the historic library of the mosque and university.[5] It is sometimes cited as the world's oldest library that remains open.[34]: 147[76][77] The first purpose-built library structure was added to the mosque by the Marinid sultan Abu Inan Faris in 1349 CE, though it was located at the mosque's northeastern corner instead of to the south.[78][5] The first structure still exists embedded near the women's section of the mosque, and consists of a square chamber measuring 5.4 meters per side. Its entrance is covered by a wooden screen from the Marinid period which features an inscription carved in cursive Arabic above the doorway recording Abu Inan's foundation of the library.[5]: 64\n\n\nThe current library building dates in part from a Saadian construction by Ahmad al-Mansur (late 16th century), who built a chamber called *al-Ahmadiyya* behind the *qibla* wall.[40] Most of the building dates from a major 20th-century expansion commissioned by King Mohammed V that started in 1940. It included the current grand reading room, which measures 23 metres long and features an ornately-painted wooden ceiling, and also added an entrance outside the mosque which made it accessible to non-Muslims.[40][39] This new library expansion was inaugurated in 1949.[72] The library complex underwent another major restoration in recent years led by Aziza Chaouni and was set to reopen in 2016 or 2017.[79][76][77][80]\n\n\n\n## Status as world's oldest university[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Madrasa § Madrasa and university\n\nUNESCO has previously described al-Qarawiyyin to be the \"oldest university in the world\" in the World Heritage Sites entry for Medina of Fez.[13] UNESCO describes the University of Bologna (founded in 1088 and usually recognized as the oldest medieval European university) as the \"oldest university of the Western world\".[81] Some historians and scholars also refer to al-Qarawiyyin as the world's oldest existing university.[34]: 137[82][83][44][84][85] The claim is also published by the *Guinness World Records*, under its entry for \"[o]ldest higher-learning institution, oldest university\", where it describes al-Qarawiyyin as the \"oldest existing, and continually operating educational institution in the world\", while the University of Bologna is described as the \"oldest one in Europe\".[86] Similarly, the *Encyclopædia Britannica* dates al-Qarawiyyin University's foundation to the mosque's foundation in 859[87] and generally considers that \"universities\" existed outside Europe before the advent of the European university model.[88] Other sources also refer to the historical or pre-modern al-Qarawiyyin as a \"university\" or an \"Islamic university\".[89][90]\n\n\nMany scholars consider the term *university* to be applicable only to the educational institutions that initially took form in medieval Christian Europe, and argue that the first universities were located in Western Europe, with those of Paris and Bologna often cited as the earliest examples.[91][92][93][94][95][96][97] The modern Western university model is thus widely argued to descend from this European tradition, even if other models of higher education existed in other parts of the world.[97][88][98] Jacques Verger says that while the term *university* is occasionally applied by scholars to madrasas and other pre-modern higher learning institutions out of convenience, the European university marked a major disruption between earlier institutions of higher learning and was the earliest true modern university.[11] Many scholars consider that the university was only adopted outside the West, including into the Islamic world, in the course of modernization programs or under European colonial regimes since the beginning of the 19th century.[99][100][11][101]\n\n\nAmong opposing views, Yahya Pallavicini claims that the university model did not spread in Europe until the 12th century and that it was found throughout the Muslim world from the founding of al-Qarawiyyin in the 9th century until at least European colonialism.[82] Some scholars, noting certain parallels between such madrasas and European medieval universities, have proposed that the latter may have been influenced by the madrasas of the Muslim world, in particular via Islamic Spain and the Emirate of Sicily.[102][103][104] Other scholars have questioned this, citing the lack of evidence for an actual transmission from the Islamic world to Christian Europe and highlighting the differences in the structure, methodologies, procedures, curricula and legal status of the madrasa versus the European university.[105][106]\n\n\nSome scholars consider that al-Qarawiyyin operated essentially as an Islamic madrasa until after World War II.[6][3][7][8][9] These scholars date al-Qarawiyyin's transformation into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.[3][1][2] In the wake of these reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" two years later.[1] Organization at the pre-modern al-Qarawiyyin differed from European universities and other Muslim institutions at al-Azhar (in Cairo) and al-Zaytouna (in Tunis) in that there was no defined scholastic year, registration was not imposed, study durations were not fixed, and there was no examination to ratify studies.[30] Students were expected to attend courses for a minimum of five years and would receive an *ijazah* if they were proven to have reached a high level of expertise.[22]: 457[30][102][43]\n\n\nThe earliest date of formal teaching at al-Qarawiyyin is also uncertain.[30][22] The most relevant major historical texts like the *Rawd al-Qirtas* and the *Zahrat al-As* do not provide clear details on the history of teaching at the mosque.[22]: 453 In the *Rawd al-Qirtas*, Ibn Abi Zar mentions the mosque but not its educational function. Al-Jazna'i, the 14th-century author of the *Zahrat al-As*, mentions that teaching had taken place there well before his time, but with no other details.[31]: 175 Otherwise, the earliest mentions of *halaqa* for learning and teaching may not have been until the 10th or the 12th century.[32][26] Moroccan historian Mohammed Al-Manouni believes that it was during the reign of the Almoravids (1040–1147) that the mosque acquired its function as a teaching institution.[30] French historian Évariste Lévi-Provençal dates the beginning of the madrasa and teaching to the later Marinid period (1244–1465).[33] Another Moroccan historian, Abdelhadi Tazi, indicated the earliest evidence of teaching at al-Qarawiyyin in 1121.[25] Upon reviewing the evidence in Abdelhadi Tazi's work, Abdul Latif Tibawi states that:\n\n\n\n\n> This is considerably later than the beginning of instruction at the al-Azhar under the Fatimids. So it is very difficult to sustain the claim that the University of Qarawiyyin is the \"oldest university\", and not only in the Muslim world! The mosque school or college did not assume the name of university until 1960 when in a ceremony Muhammad V invested it with that dignified title.[107]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nA number of well-known philosophers, scholars, and politicians in the history of Morocco and the western Mediterranean have either studied or taught at the Qarawiyyin since its founding.\n\n\n\n* Maimonides (1135/1138–1204), Jewish philosopher[1][108][109][110]\n* Ibn Arabi (1165–1240), Sufi philosopher[108][109]\n* Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406), historian and philosopher[1][108][37][109]\n* Leo Africanus (1494–1554), author[108]\n* Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari (1632-1577), historian and theologian, appointed imam and mufti by the Saadi Sultan Zaydan[111]\n* Imam al-Bannani (1727–1780), faqīh (Muslim jurist)[*citation needed*]\n* Ahmad ibn Idris (1760–1837), Moroccan Sufi scholar[112]\n* Muhammad al-Kattani (1873–1909), writer and political leader[113]\n* Abd el-Krim el-Khattabi (1882–1963), Rifian-Moroccan political and military leader[114]\n* Allal al-Fassi (1910–1974), Moroccan politician[115]\n* Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali (1893–1987), translator[116]\n* Abdullah al-Ghumari (1910–1993), faqīh (Muslim jurist)[117]\n* Fatima al-Kabbaj (1932–), Member of High Council of Knowledge [ar] (Islamic council) Notably, one of the first few women to be admitted.[15]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Morocco portal\n\n\n* List of Islamic educational institutions\n* List of universities in Morocco\n* Education in Morocco\n* History of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** One single plate from *Bab al-Gna'iz* is also kept by the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris.[60]: 56\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** Lulat, Y.

It was founded as a mosque in Fès in the middle of the ninth century. It has been a destination for students and scholars of Islamic sciences and Arabic studies throughout the history of Morocco. There were also other religious schools like the madras of ibn yusuf and other schools in the sus. This system of basic education called al-ta'lim al-aSil was funded by the sultans of Morocco and many famous traditional families. After independence, al-qarawiyin maintained its reputation, but it seemed important to transform it into a university that would prepare graduates for a modern country while maintaining an emphasis on Islamic studies. Hence, al-qarawiyin university was founded in February 1963 and, while the dean's residence was kept in Fès, the new university initially had four colleges located in major regions of the country known for their religious influences and madrasas. These colleges were kuliyat al-shari's in Fès, kuliyat uSul al-din in Tétouan, kuliyat al-lugha al-'arabiya in Marrakech (all founded in 1963), and kuliyat al-shari'a in Ait Melloul near Agadir, which was founded in 1979.\n> \n>\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Belhachmi, Zakia (2008). *Women, Education, and Science within the Arab-Islamic Socio-Cultural History: Legacies for Social Change*.

This resulted in three different types of Islamic teaching institutions in al-Maghrib. The first type was derived from the fusion of old madaris with new universities. For example, Morocco transformed Al-Qarawiyin (859 A.D) into a university under the supervision of the ministry of education in 1963.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Petersen, Andrew: *Dictionary of Islamic Architecture*, Routledge, 1996, ISBN 978-0-415-06084-4, p. 87 (entry \"Fez\"): \n> The Quaraouiyine Mosque, founded in 859, is the most famous mosque of Morocco and attracted continuous investment by Muslim rulers.\n> \n>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** ***ac*** ***ad*** ***ae*** ***af*** ***ag*** ***ah*** ***ai*** ***aj*** ***ak*** ***al*** ***am*** ***an*** ***ao*** ***ap*** ***aq*** ***ar*** ***as*** ***at*** ***au*** ***av*** ***aw*** ***ax*** ***ay*** ***az*** ***ba*** ***bb*** ***bc*** ***bd*** ***be*** ***bf*** ***bg*** ***bh*** ***bi*** ***bj*** ***bk*** ***bl*** ***bm*** ***bn*** ***bo*** ***bp*** Terrasse, Henri (1968). *La Mosquée al-Qaraouiyin à Fès; avec une étude de Gaston Deverdun sur les inscriptions historiques de la mosquée*.

For example many madrasah teachers are versed in Islamic pedagogy but also in modern university pedagogic developments such as behaviourist, cognitivist and the more recent constructivist styles. Al-Qarawiyyin University, in Morocco, represents such an institution that is grounded in a traditional madrasah education but for example, continues to adopt ancillary subjects and modern technologies such as mobile learning.\n10. **^** Makdisi, George: \"Madrasa and University in the Middle Ages\", *Studia Islamica*, No. 32 (1970), pp. 255–264 (255f.): \n> In studying an institution which is foreign and remote in point of time, as is the case of the medieval madrasa, one runs the double risk of attributing to it characteristics borrowed from one's own institutions and one's own times. Thus gratuitous transfers may be made from one culture to the other, and the time factor may be ignored or dismissed as being without significance. One cannot, therefore, be too careful in attempting a comparative study of these two institutions: the madrasa and the university. But in spite of the pitfalls inherent in such a study, albeit sketchy, the results which may be obtained are well worth the risks involved. In any case, one cannot avoid making comparisons when certain unwarranted statements have already been made and seem to be currently accepted without question. The most unwarranted of these statements is the one which makes of the \"madrasa\" a \"university\".\n> \n>\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Verger, Jacques: \"Patterns\", in: Ridder-Symoens, Hilde de (ed.): *A History of the University in Europe.

It is no doubt true that other civilizations, prior to, or wholly alien to, the medieval West, such as the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Islam, or China, were familiar with forms of higher education which a number of historians, for the sake of convenience, have sometimes described as universities. Yet a closer look makes it plain that the institutional reality was altogether different and, no matter what has been said on the subject, there is no real link such as would justify us in associating them with medieval universities in the West. Until there is definite proof to the contrary, these latter must be regarded as the sole source of the model which gradually spread through the whole of Europe and then to the whole world. We are therefore concerned with what is indisputably an original institution, which can only be defined in terms of a historical analysis of its emergence and its mode of operation in concrete circumstances.\n> \n>\n12. **^** \"Oldest higher-learning institution, oldest university\". *Guinness World Records*.

Vol. I: Universities in the Middle Ages*, Cambridge University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-521-36105-2, pp. XIX-XX: \n> The university is a European institution; indeed, it is the European institution *par excellence*. There are various reasons for this assertion. As a community of teachers and taught, accorded certain rights, such as administrative autonomy and the determination and realization of curricula (courses of study) and of the objectives of research as well as the award of publicly recognized degrees, it is a creation of medieval Europe, which was the Europe of papal Christianity...\n> \n> \n> No other European institution has spread over the entire world in the way in which the traditional form of the European university has done. The degrees awarded by European universities – the bachelor's degree, the licentiate, the master's degree, and the doctorate – have been adopted in the most diverse societies throughout the world. The four medieval faculties of *artes* – variously called philosophy, letters, arts, arts and sciences, and humanities –, law, medicine, and theology have survived and have been supplemented by numerous disciplines, particularly the social sciences and technological studies, but they remain nonetheless at the heart of universities throughout the world.\n> \n> \n> Even the name of the *Universitas*, which in the Middle Ages was applied to corporate bodies of the most diverse sorts and was accordingly applied to the corporate organization of teachers and students, has in the course of centuries been given a more particular focus: the university, as a *universitas litterarum*, has since the eighteenth century been the intellectual institution which cultivates and transmits the entire corpus of methodically studied intellectual disciplines.\n> \n>\n101. **^** Sanz, Nuria; Bergan, Sjur (eds.): *The Heritage of European Universities*, Council of Europe, 2002, ISBN 978-92-871-4960-2, p. 119: \n> In many respects, if there is any institution that Europe can most justifiably claim as one of its inventions, it is the university. As proof thereof and without wishing here to recount the whole history of the birth of universities, it will suffice to describe briefly how the invention of universities took the form of a polycentric process of specifically European origin.\n> \n>\n102. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Makdisi, George (April–June 1989), \"Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West\", *Journal of the American Oriental Society*, **109** (2), American Oriental Society: 175–182 [176], doi:10.2307/604423, JSTOR 604423\n103. **^** Burke II, Edmund (2009). \"Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity\". *Journal of World History*. **20** (2): 165–186. doi:10.1353/jwh.0.0045.

At its foundation, the word *universitas* was first coined.[3][4] The university's emblem carries the motto, *Alma Mater Studiorum* (\"Nourishing mother of studies\"), the date *A.D. 1088*.[5] With over 90,000 students, the University of Bologna is one of the largest universities in Europe. \n\n\nThe university saw the first woman to earn a university degree and teach at a university, Bettisia Gozzadini, and the first woman to earn both a doctorate in science and a salaried position as a university professor, Laura Bassi. The University of Bologna has had a central role in the sciences during the medieval age and the Italian renaissance, where it housed and educated Nicholas Copernicus as well as numerous other renaissance mathematicians.[6] It has educated a wide range of notable alumni, amongst them a large number of Italian scientists, prime ministers, supreme court judges, and priests.[7]\n\n\nThe University of Bologna has campuses in Cesena, Forlì, Ravenna and Rimini as well as branch centres abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina, New York, Brussels, and Shanghai.[8] It houses the fully funded boarding college *Collegio Superiore di Bologna,* the Bologna School of Advanced Studies,[9] the botanical gardens of Bologna, a large number of museums, libraries and archeological collections,[10] as well as the Bologna University Press. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The entry of students in the *Natio Germanica Bononiae*, the nation of German students at Bologna; miniature of 1497.\nThe date of the University of Bologna's founding is uncertain. The university was granted a charter (*Authentica habita*) by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158, but in the 19th century, a committee of historians led by Giosuè Carducci traced the founding of the university back to 1088, which would make it the oldest continuously operating university in the world.[11][12][13] However, the development of the institution at Bologna into a university was a gradual process. Paul Grendler writes that \"it is not likely that enough instruction and organization existed to merit the term *university* before the 1150s, and it might not have happened before the 1180s.\"[14]\n\n\nThe university arose around mutual aid societies (known as *universitates scholarium*) of foreign students called \"nations\" (as they were grouped by nationality) for protection against city laws which imposed collective punishment on foreigners for the crimes and debts of their countrymen. These students then hired scholars from the city's pre-existing lay and ecclesiastical schools to teach them subjects such as liberal arts, notarial law, theology, and *ars dictaminis* (scrivenery).[15] The lectures were given in informal schools called *scholae*. In time the various *universitates scholarium* decided to form a larger association, or *Studium*—thus, the university. The *Studium* grew to have a strong position of collective bargaining with the city, since by then it derived significant revenue through visiting foreign students, who would depart if they were not well treated. The foreign students in Bologna received greater rights, and collective punishment was ended. There was also collective bargaining with the scholars who served as professors at the university. By the initiation or threat of a student strike, the students could enforce their demands as to the content of courses and the pay professors would receive. University professors were hired, fired, and had their pay determined by an elected council of two representatives from every student \"nation\" which governed the institution, with the most important decisions requiring a majority vote from all the students to ratify. The professors could also be fined if they failed to finish classes on time, or complete course material by the end of the semester. A student committee, the \"Denouncers of Professors\", kept tabs on them and reported any misbehavior. Professors themselves were not powerless, however, forming *collegia doctorum* (professors’ committees) in each faculty, and securing the rights to set examination fees and degree requirements. Eventually, the city ended this arrangement, paying professors from tax revenues and making it a chartered public university.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bologna University Library\nThe university is historically notable for its teaching of canon and civil law;[17] indeed, it was set up in large part with the aim of studying the *Digest,*[18] a central text in Roman law, which had been rediscovered in Italy in 1070, and the university was central in the development of medieval Roman law.[19] Until modern times, the only degree granted at that university was the doctorate.\n\n\nBettisia Gozzadini earned a law degree in 1237, being one of the first women in history to obtain a university degree.[20] She taught law from her own home for two years, and in 1239 she taught at the university, becoming the first woman in history to teach at a university.[21]\n\n\nIn 1477, when Pope Sixtus IV issued a papal bull, authorizing the creation of Uppsala University in Sweden, the bull specified that the new university would have the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna - a highly desirable situation for the Swedish scholars. This included the right of Uppsala to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor's, master's, licentiate, and doctoral degrees.\n\n\nLaura Bassi was born into a prosperous family of Bologna and was privately educated from the age of five.[22] Bassi's education and intellect was noticed by Prospero Lorenzini Lambertini, who became the Archbishop of Bologna in 1731 (later Pope Benedict XIV). Lambertini became the official patron of Bassi. He arranged for a public debate between Bassi and four professors from the University of Bologna on 17 April 1732.[23] In 1732, Bassi, aged twenty, publicly defended her forty-nine theses on *Philosophica Studia*[24] at the Sala degli Anziani of the Palazzo Pubblico. The University of Bologna awarded her a doctorate degree on 12 May.[25] She became the first woman to receive a doctorate in science, and the second woman in the world to earn a philosophy doctorate after Elena Cornaro Piscopia in 1678, fifty-four years prior. She was by then popularly known as Bolognese Minerva.[26][22] On 29 October 1732, the Senate and the University of Bologna granted Bassi's candidature, and in December she was appointed professor of natural philosophy to teach physics.[27][28] She became the first salaried woman lecturer in the world,[29] thus beginning her academic career. She was also the first woman member of any scientific establishment, when she was elected to the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna in 1732.[30][31] Bassi became the most important populariser of Newtonian mechanics in Italy.[32]\n\n\nIn 1971, the Graecist Benedetto Marzullo in company with Umberto Eco, Renato Barilli, Adelio Ferrero. instituted within the Faculty of Letters and Arts the DAMS (acronym of *discipline delle arti, della musica e dello spettacolo*, \"Dicipline of Arts, Musics and Performance\"). It was the first degree course of this type to be opened in Italy. Between December 26, 1982, and November 29, 1983, there occurred the DAMS murders (in Italian: *Delitti del DAMS*), dealing with four victims who were students or professors of the DAMS: Angelo Fabbri (a brilliant student of Umberto Eco), Liviana Rossi, the dancer Francesca Alinovi (who was stabbed for 47 times), and Leonarda Polvani.[33][34]\n\n\n\n## Organization[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Nowadays the university offers 101 different \"*Laurea*\" or \"*Laurea breve*\" first-level degrees (three years of courses), followed by 108 \"*Laurea specialistica*\" or \"*Laurea magistrale*\" second-level degrees (two years). However 11 other courses have maintained the previous rules of \"*Laurea specialistica a ciclo unico*\" or \"*Laurea magistrale a ciclo unico*\", with only one cycle of study of five years, except for medicine and dentistry, which require six years of courses. After the \"*Laurea*\" one may attain first-level Master (one-year diploma, similar to a postgraduate diploma). After second-level degrees are attained, one may proceed to second-level Master, specialisation schools (residency) or research doctorates (PhD).\n\n\nThe 11 Schools (which replace the existing 23 faculties) are:\n\n\n\n* School of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine\n* School of Economics, Management and Statistics\n* School of Engineering and Architecture\n* School of Foreign Languages and Literature, Interpreting and Translation\n* School of Law\n* School of Arts, Humanities, and Cultural Heritage\n* School of Medicine and Surgery\n* School of Pharmacy, Biotechnologies and Sport Sciences\n* School of Political Sciences\n* School of Psychology and Education Sciences\n* School of Sciences\n\n\nThe university is structured in 33 departments[35] (66 until 2012), organized by homogeneous research domains that integrate activities related to one or more faculty.

On 25 April 1951 the first issue of the review was published in Bologna.[36] In a short time, \"il Mulino\" became one of the most interesting reference points in Italy for the political and cultural debate and established important editorial relationships in Italy and abroad. Editorial activities evolved along with the review. In 1954, the il Mulino publishing house (It. *Società editrice il Mulino*) was founded, which today represents one of the most relevant Italian publishers. In addition to this were initiated research projects (focusing mostly on the educational institutions and the political system in Italy), that eventually led, in 1964, to the establishment of the Istituto Carlo Cattaneo.\n\n\n\n### Collegio Superiore[edit]\n\n\nThe *Collegio Superiore* is an excellence institution inside the University of Bologna, aimed at promoting students' merit through dedicated learning programmes.\n\n\nThe institution was founded in 1998 as *Collegio d'Eccellenza*. Together with the Institute for Advanced Study it is part of the Institute for Higher Study.\n\n\nThe Collegio Superiore offers an additional educational path to students enrolled in a degree programme at the University of Bologna, providing specialized courses as part of an interdisciplinary framework.\n\n\nAll students of the Collegio Superiore are granted a full-ride scholarship and additional benefits such as the assistance of a personal tutor and free accommodation at the Residence for Higher Study. In order to remain members of the Collegio Superiore students are required to maintain high marks in both their degree programme and the additional courses.\n\n\nBeatrice Fraboni, professor of Physics of Matter, has been head of Collegio Superiore since 2019.[37]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Bologna people\n\n![](image)*Pope Alexander VI*\n\n![](image)*Petrarch*\n\n![](image)*Carlo Goldoni*\n\n![](image)*Guglielmo Marconi*\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\n* Adone Zoli, former Prime Minister of Italy.\n* Cardinal Alberto Bolognetti\n* Pope Alexander VI[38]\n* Álvaro de Figueroa, former Prime Minister of Spain.\n* Anna M.

Founded in 1088 by an organised guild of students (*studiorum*), it is the oldest university in continuous operation in the world, and the first degree-awarding institution of higher learning. At its foundation, the word *universitas* was first coined.[3][4] The university's emblem carries the motto, *Alma Mater Studiorum* (\"Nourishing mother of studies\"), the date *A.D. 1088*.[5] With over 90,000 students, the University of Bologna is one of the largest universities in Europe. \n\n\nThe university saw the first woman to earn a university degree and teach at a university, Bettisia Gozzadini, and the first woman to earn both a doctorate in science and a salaried position as a university professor, Laura Bassi. The University of Bologna has had a central role in the sciences during the medieval age and the Italian renaissance, where it housed and educated Nicholas Copernicus as well as numerous other renaissance mathematicians.[6] It has educated a wide range of notable alumni, amongst them a large number of Italian scientists, prime ministers, supreme court judges, and priests.[7]\n\n\nThe University of Bologna has campuses in Cesena, Forlì, Ravenna and Rimini as well as branch centres abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina, New York, Brussels, and Shanghai.[8] It houses the fully funded boarding college *Collegio Superiore di Bologna,* the Bologna School of Advanced Studies,[9] the botanical gardens of Bologna, a large number of museums, libraries and archeological collections,[10] as well as the Bologna University Press. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The entry of students in the *Natio Germanica Bononiae*, the nation of German students at Bologna; miniature of 1497.\nThe date of the University of Bologna's founding is uncertain. The university was granted a charter (*Authentica habita*) by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158, but in the 19th century, a committee of historians led by Giosuè Carducci traced the founding of the university back to 1088, which would make it the oldest continuously operating university in the world.[11][12][13] However, the development of the institution at Bologna into a university was a gradual process. Paul Grendler writes that \"it is not likely that enough instruction and organization existed to merit the term *university* before the 1150s, and it might not have happened before the 1180s.\"[14]\n\n\nThe university arose around mutual aid societies (known as *universitates scholarium*) of foreign students called \"nations\" (as they were grouped by nationality) for protection against city laws which imposed collective punishment on foreigners for the crimes and debts of their countrymen. These students then hired scholars from the city's pre-existing lay and ecclesiastical schools to teach them subjects such as liberal arts, notarial law, theology, and *ars dictaminis* (scrivenery).[15] The lectures were given in informal schools called *scholae*. In time the various *universitates scholarium* decided to form a larger association, or *Studium*—thus, the university. The *Studium* grew to have a strong position of collective bargaining with the city, since by then it derived significant revenue through visiting foreign students, who would depart if they were not well treated. The foreign students in Bologna received greater rights, and collective punishment was ended. There was also collective bargaining with the scholars who served as professors at the university. By the initiation or threat of a student strike, the students could enforce their demands as to the content of courses and the pay professors would receive. University professors were hired, fired, and had their pay determined by an elected council of two representatives from every student \"nation\" which governed the institution, with the most important decisions requiring a majority vote from all the students to ratify. The professors could also be fined if they failed to finish classes on time, or complete course material by the end of the semester. A student committee, the \"Denouncers of Professors\", kept tabs on them and reported any misbehavior. Professors themselves were not powerless, however, forming *collegia doctorum* (professors’ committees) in each faculty, and securing the rights to set examination fees and degree requirements. Eventually, the city ended this arrangement, paying professors from tax revenues and making it a chartered public university.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bologna University Library\nThe university is historically notable for its teaching of canon and civil law;[17] indeed, it was set up in large part with the aim of studying the *Digest,*[18] a central text in Roman law, which had been rediscovered in Italy in 1070, and the university was central in the development of medieval Roman law.[19] Until modern times, the only degree granted at that university was the doctorate.\n\n\nBettisia Gozzadini earned a law degree in 1237, being one of the first women in history to obtain a university degree.[20] She taught law from her own home for two years, and in 1239 she taught at the university, becoming the first woman in history to teach at a university.[21]\n\n\nIn 1477, when Pope Sixtus IV issued a papal bull, authorizing the creation of Uppsala University in Sweden, the bull specified that the new university would have the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna - a highly desirable situation for the Swedish scholars. This included the right of Uppsala to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor's, master's, licentiate, and doctoral degrees.\n\n\nLaura Bassi was born into a prosperous family of Bologna and was privately educated from the age of five.[22] Bassi's education and intellect was noticed by Prospero Lorenzini Lambertini, who became the Archbishop of Bologna in 1731 (later Pope Benedict XIV). Lambertini became the official patron of Bassi. He arranged for a public debate between Bassi and four professors from the University of Bologna on 17 April 1732.[23] In 1732, Bassi, aged twenty, publicly defended her forty-nine theses on *Philosophica Studia*[24] at the Sala degli Anziani of the Palazzo Pubblico. The University of Bologna awarded her a doctorate degree on 12 May.[25] She became the first woman to receive a doctorate in science, and the second woman in the world to earn a philosophy doctorate after Elena Cornaro Piscopia in 1678, fifty-four years prior. She was by then popularly known as Bolognese Minerva.[26][22] On 29 October 1732, the Senate and the University of Bologna granted Bassi's candidature, and in December she was appointed professor of natural philosophy to teach physics.[27][28] She became the first salaried woman lecturer in the world,[29] thus beginning her academic career. She was also the first woman member of any scientific establishment, when she was elected to the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna in 1732.[30][31] Bassi became the most important populariser of Newtonian mechanics in Italy.[32]\n\n\nIn 1971, the Graecist Benedetto Marzullo in company with Umberto Eco, Renato Barilli, Adelio Ferrero. instituted within the Faculty of Letters and Arts the DAMS (acronym of *discipline delle arti, della musica e dello spettacolo*, \"Dicipline of Arts, Musics and Performance\"). It was the first degree course of this type to be opened in Italy. Between December 26, 1982, and November 29, 1983, there occurred the DAMS murders (in Italian: *Delitti del DAMS*), dealing with four victims who were students or professors of the DAMS: Angelo Fabbri (a brilliant student of Umberto Eco), Liviana Rossi, the dancer Francesca Alinovi (who was stabbed for 47 times), and Leonarda Polvani.[33][34]\n\n\n\n## Organization[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Nowadays the university offers 101 different \"*Laurea*\" or \"*Laurea breve*\" first-level degrees (three years of courses), followed by 108 \"*Laurea specialistica*\" or \"*Laurea magistrale*\" second-level degrees (two years). However 11 other courses have maintained the previous rules of \"*Laurea specialistica a ciclo unico*\" or \"*Laurea magistrale a ciclo unico*\", with only one cycle of study of five years, except for medicine and dentistry, which require six years of courses. After the \"*Laurea*\" one may attain first-level Master (one-year diploma, similar to a postgraduate diploma). After second-level degrees are attained, one may proceed to second-level Master, specialisation schools (residency) or research doctorates (PhD).\n\n\nThe 11 Schools (which replace the existing 23 faculties) are:\n\n\n\n* School of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine\n* School of Economics, Management and Statistics\n* School of Engineering and Architecture\n* School of Foreign Languages and Literature, Interpreting and Translation\n* School of Law\n* School of Arts, Humanities, and Cultural Heritage\n* School of Medicine and Surgery\n* School of Pharmacy, Biotechnologies and Sport Sciences\n* School of Political Sciences\n* School of Psychology and Education Sciences\n* School of Sciences\n\n\nThe university is structured in 33 departments[35] (66 until 2012), organized by homogeneous research domains that integrate activities related to one or more faculty. A new department of Latin history was added in 2015.\n\n\nThe 33 departments are:\n\n\n\n* Architecture - DA\n* Cultural Heritage - DBC\n* Chemistry \"Giacomo Ciamician\" - CHIM\n* Industrial Chemistry \"Toso Montanari\" - CHIMIND\n* Arts - DARvipem\n* Pharmacy and Biotechnology - FaBiT\n* Classical Philology and Italian Studies - FICLIT\n* Philosophy and Communication Studies - FILCOM\n* Physics and Astronomy - DIFA\n* Computer Science and Engineering - DISI\n* Civil, Chemical, Environmental, and Materials Engineering - DICAM\n* Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering \"Guglielmo Marconi\" - DEI\n* Industrial Engineering - DIN\n* Interpreting and Translation - DIT\n* Modern Languages, Literatures, and Cultures - LILEC\n* Mathematics - MAT\n* Experimental Medicine, Diagnostic Medicine and Specialty Medicine - DIMES\n* Psychology - PSI\n* Agricultural Sciences - DipSA\n* Management - DiSA\n* Biological, Geological, and Environmental Sciences - BiGeA\n* Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences - DIBINEM\n* Education Studies \"Giovanni Maria Bertin\" - EDU\n* Agricultural and Food Sciences - DISTAL\n* Economics - DSE\n* Legal Studies - DSG\n* Medical and Surgical Sciences - DIMEC\n* Veterinary Medical Sciences - DIMEVET\n* Department for Life Quality Studies - QUVI\n* Political and Social Sciences - SPS\n* Statistical Sciences \"Paolo Fortunati\" - STAT\n* Sociology and Business Law - SDE\n* History and Cultures - DiSCi\n\n\n## Affiliates and other institutions[edit]\n\n\n### Il Mulino[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1950s, some students of the University of Bologna were among the founders of the review \"il Mulino\". On 25 April 1951 the first issue of the review was published in Bologna.[36] In a short time, \"il Mulino\" became one of the most interesting reference points in Italy for the political and cultural debate and established important editorial relationships in Italy and abroad. Editorial activities evolved along with the review. In 1954, the il Mulino publishing house (It. *Società editrice il Mulino*) was founded, which today represents one of the most relevant Italian publishers. In addition to this were initiated research projects (focusing mostly on the educational institutions and the political system in Italy), that eventually led, in 1964, to the establishment of the Istituto Carlo Cattaneo.\n\n\n\n### Collegio Superiore[edit]\n\n\nThe *Collegio Superiore* is an excellence institution inside the University of Bologna, aimed at promoting students' merit through dedicated learning programmes.\n\n\nThe institution was founded in 1998 as *Collegio d'Eccellenza*. Together with the Institute for Advanced Study it is part of the Institute for Higher Study.\n\n\nThe Collegio Superiore offers an additional educational path to students enrolled in a degree programme at the University of Bologna, providing specialized courses as part of an interdisciplinary framework.\n\n\nAll students of the Collegio Superiore are granted a full-ride scholarship and additional benefits such as the assistance of a personal tutor and free accommodation at the Residence for Higher Study. In order to remain members of the Collegio Superiore students are required to maintain high marks in both their degree programme and the additional courses.\n\n\nBeatrice Fraboni, professor of Physics of Matter, has been head of Collegio Superiore since 2019.[37]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Bologna people\n\n![](image)*Pope Alexander VI*\n\n![](image)*Petrarch*\n\n![](image)*Carlo Goldoni*\n\n![](image)*Guglielmo Marconi*\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\n* Adone Zoli, former Prime Minister of Italy.\n* Cardinal Alberto Bolognetti\n* Pope Alexander VI[38]\n* Álvaro de Figueroa, former Prime Minister of Spain.\n* Anna M.

There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][11][12] It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[13] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford is made up of thirty-nine semi-autonomous constituent colleges, four permanent private halls, and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions.[14] All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college.[15] It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided in a predominantly centralised fashion.\n\n\nOxford operates the Ashmolean Museum, the world's oldest university museum; Oxford University Press, the largest university press in the world; and the largest academic library system nationwide.[16] In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2022, the university had a total consolidated income of £2.78 billion, of which £711.4 million was from research grants and contracts.[4]\n\n\nOxford has educated a wide range of notable alumni, including 30 prime ministers of the United Kingdom and many heads of state and government around the world.[17] As of October 2022,[update] 73 Nobel Prize laureates, 4 Fields Medalists, and 6 Turing Award winners have matriculated, worked, or held visiting fellowships at the University of Oxford, while its alumni have won 160 Olympic medals.[18] Oxford is the home of numerous scholarships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, one of the oldest international graduate scholarship programmes.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Oxford\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Merton College's Mob Quad, the oldest quadrangle of the university, constructed between 1288 and 1378\n![](image)In 1605, Oxford was still a walled city, but several colleges had been built outside the city walls (north is at the bottom on this map).\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Balliol College, one of the university's oldest constituent colleges\nThe University of Oxford's foundation date is unknown.[19] It is known that teaching at Oxford existed in some form as early as 1096, but it is unclear when the university came into being.[2] The scholar Theobald of Étampes lectured at Oxford in the early 1100s.\n\n\nIt grew quickly from 1167 when English students returned from the University of Paris.[2] The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188, and the first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a *universitas* or corporation in 1231.[2][20] The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during the reign of King Henry III.[21]\n\n\nAfter disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled from the violence to Cambridge, later forming the University of Cambridge.[13][22]\n\n\nThe students associated together on the basis of geographical origins, into two 'nations', representing the North (*northerners* or *Boreales*, who included the English people from north of the River Trent and the Scots) and the South (*southerners* or *Australes*, who included English people from south of the Trent, the Irish and the Welsh).[23][24] In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students' affiliations when membership of a college or hall became customary in Oxford. In addition, members of many religious orders, including Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites and Augustinians, settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence and maintained houses or halls for students.[25] At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest such founders were William of Durham, who in 1249 endowed University College,[25] and John Balliol, father of a future King of Scots; Balliol College bears his name.[23] Another founder, Walter de Merton, a Lord Chancellor of England and afterwards Bishop of Rochester, devised a series of regulations for college life;[26][27] Merton College thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford,[28] as well as at the University of Cambridge. Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.[25]\n\n\nIn 1333–1334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III.[29] Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### Renaissance period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An engraving of Christ Church, Oxford, 1742\nThe new learning of the Renaissance greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn, who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies,[32] and John Colet, the noted biblical scholar.[33]\n\n\nWith the English Reformation and the breaking of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai.[34] The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.[35]\n\n\nIn 1636,[36] William Laud, the chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury, codified the university's statutes. These, to a large extent, remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press, and he made significant contributions to the Bodleian Library, the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to receive the BA degree from the university and \"dissenters\" were only permitted to receive the MA in 1871.[37]\n\n\nThe university was a centre of the Royalist party during the English Civil War (1642–1649), while the town favoured the opposing Parliamentarian cause.[38]\n\n\n\n![Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College](image)Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College\nWadham College, founded in 1610, was the undergraduate college of Sir Christopher Wren.\n\n\nWren was part of a brilliant group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the Oxford Philosophical Club, which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group, which has at times been linked with Boyle's \"Invisible College\" held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the college's Warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus that went on to found the Royal Society.[39]\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\n#### Students[edit]\n\n\nBefore reforms in the early 19th century, the curriculum at Oxford was notoriously narrow and impractical. Sir Spencer Walpole, a historian of contemporary Britain and a senior government official, had not attended any university. He said, \"Few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quoted the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\"[40] Nevertheless, Walpole argued:\n\n\n\n\n>  Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.[41]\n> \n> \n\n\nOut of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (59% as Anglican clergy). Out of the students who matriculated in 1870, 59% were sons of professionals (25% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (42% as Anglican clergy).[42][43]\n\n\nM. C. Curthoys and H. S. Jones argue that the rise of organised sport was one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton, Winchester, Shrewsbury, and Harrow.[44]\n\n\nAll students, regardless of their chosen area of study, were required to spend (at least) their first year preparing for a first-year examination that was heavily focused on classical languages. Science students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with Greek language study removed from their required courses. This concept of a Bachelor of Science had been adopted at other European universities (London University had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.[45]\n\n\nAt the start of 1914, the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War, many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total.[46] The University Roll of Service records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed.[47] Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, 'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914–1918'. During the war years the university buildings became hospitals, cadet schools and military training camps.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Reforms[edit]\n\n\nTwo parliamentary commissions in 1852 issued recommendations for Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[48][49]\n\n\nThe system of separate honour schools for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and Literae Humaniores.[50] Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853.[50] By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\". Theology became the sixth honour school.[51] In addition to these B.A. Honours degrees, the postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) was, and still is, offered.[52]\n\n\nThe mid-19th century saw the impact of the Oxford Movement (1833–1845), led among others by the future Cardinal John Henry Newman. \n\n\nAdministrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, and the establishment of four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford began to award doctorates for research in the first third of the 20th century. The first Oxford DPhil in mathematics was awarded in 1921.[53]\n\n\nThe list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to politics, the sciences, medicine, and literature. As of October 2022, 73 Nobel laureates and more than 50 world leaders have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.[17]\n\n\n\n### Women's education[edit]\n\n\nFirst two women's colleges\n![](image)\nLady Margaret Hall, founded in 1878\n![](image)\nSomerville College, founded in 1879\n\nThe university passed a statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level;[54] for a brief period in the early 1900s, this allowed the \"steamboat ladies\" to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[55] In June 1878, the *Association for the Education of Women* (AEW) was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, T. H. Green and Edward Stuart Talbot. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group founded Lady Margaret Hall in 1878, while T. H. Green founded the non-denominational Somerville College in 1879.[56] Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville opened their doors to their first 21 students (12 from Somerville, 9 from Lady Margaret Hall) in 1879, who attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop.[54] There were also 25 women students living at home or with friends in 1879, a group which evolved into the Society of Oxford Home-Students and in 1952 into St Anne's College.[57][58]\n\n\nThese first three societies for women were followed by St Hugh's (1886)[59] and St Hilda's (1893).[60] All of these colleges later became coeducational, starting with Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne's in 1979,[61][62] and finishing with St Hilda's, which began to accept male students in 2008.[63] In the early 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege,[64] however the integration of women into Oxford moved forward during the First World War. In 1916 women were admitted as medical students on a par with men, and in 1917 the university accepted financial responsibility for women's examinations.[46]\n\n\nOn 7 October 1920 women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees.[65] In 1927 the university's dons created a quota that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957.[54] However, during this period Oxford colleges were single sex, so the number of women was also limited by the capacity of the women's colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status.[66]\n\n\nIn 1974, Brasenose, Jesus, Wadham, Hertford and St Catherine's became the first previously all-male colleges to admit women.[67][68] The majority of men's colleges accepted their first female students in 1979,[68] with Christ Church following in 1980,[69] and Oriel becoming the last men's college to admit women in 1985.[70] Most of Oxford's graduate colleges were founded as coeducational establishments in the 20th century, with the exception of St Antony's, which was founded as a men's college in 1950 and began to accept women only in 1962.[71] By 1988, 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female;[72] in 2016, 45% of the student population, and 47% of undergraduate students, were female.[73][74]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Oxford announced that starting the following academic year, history students may choose to sit a take-home exam in some courses, with the intention that this will equalise rates of firsts awarded to women and men at Oxford.[75] That same summer, maths and computer science tests were extended by 15 minutes, in a bid to see if female student scores would improve.[76][77]\n\n\nThe detective novel *Gaudy Night* by Dorothy L. Sayers, herself one of the first women to gain an academic degree from Oxford, is largely set in the all-female Shrewsbury College, Oxford (based on Sayers' own Somerville College[78]), and the issue of women's education is central to its plot. Social historian and Somerville College alumna Jane Robinson's book *Bluestockings: A Remarkable History of the First Women to Fight for an Education* gives a very detailed and immersive account of this history.[79]\n\n\n\n## Buildings and sites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Scrollable image*.

heavily in new facilities at the laboratory in recent years.\n![](image)Sheldonian Theatre, built by Christopher Wren between 1664 and 1668, hosts the university's Congregation and its concerts and degree ceremonies.\nThe university is a \"city university\" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. The Science Area, in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) Radcliffe Observatory Quarter in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIconic university buildings include the Radcliffe Camera, the Sheldonian Theatre used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the Examination Schools, where examinations and some lectures take place. The University Church of St Mary the Virgin was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian. Christ Church Cathedral uniquely serves as both a college chapel and as a cathedral.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2012–2013, the university built the controversial one-hectare (400 m × 25 m) Castle Mill development of 4–5-storey blocks of student flats overlooking Cripley Meadow and the historic Port Meadow, blocking views of the spires in the city centre.[80] The development has been likened to building a \"skyscraper beside Stonehenge\".[81]\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Summer in the Botanic Garden\nThe University Parks are a 70-acre (28 ha) parkland area in the northeast of the city, near Keble College, Somerville College and Lady Margaret Hall. It is open to the public during daylight hours. \n\n\nThe Botanic Garden on the High Street is the oldest botanic garden in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on 1.8 ha (4+1⁄2 acres). It is one of the most diverse yet compact major collections of plants in the world and includes representatives of over 90% of the higher plant families. The Harcourt Arboretum is a 130-acre (53 ha) site six miles (9.7 km) south of the city that includes native woodland and 67 acres (27 hectares) of meadow. The 1,000-acre (4.0 km2) Wytham Woods are owned by the university and used for research in zoology and climate change.[82]\n\n\nThere are also various college-owned open spaces open to the public, including Bagley Wood and most notably Christ Church Meadow.[83]\n\n\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Departments of the University of Oxford\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Central governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wellington Square has become synonymous with the university's central administration.\nThe university's formal head is the Chancellor, currently Lord Patten of Barnes, though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figurehead and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of Convocation, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.[84]\n\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor, currently Irene Tracey,[6] is the *de facto* head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. \n\n\nTwo university proctors, elected annually on a rotating basis from any two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student discipline and complaints, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings.[85] The university's professors are collectively referred to as the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the Chichele Professorships and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy. \n\n\nThe University of Oxford is only a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.[86]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Tom Quad, Christ Church\n![](image)Main Quad, Worcester College\nTo be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall. There are thirty-nine colleges of the University of Oxford and four permanent private halls (PPHs), each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities.[15] Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.\n\n\nThe colleges are:\n\n\n\n* All Souls College\n* Balliol College\n* Brasenose College\n* Christ Church\n* Corpus Christi College\n* Exeter College\n* Green Templeton College\n* Harris Manchester College\n* Hertford College\n* Jesus College\n* Keble College\n* Kellogg College\n* Lady Margaret Hall\n* Linacre College\n* Lincoln College\n* Magdalen College\n* Mansfield College\n* Merton College\n* New College\n* Nuffield College\n* Oriel College\n* Pembroke College\n* The Queen's College\n* Reuben College\n* St Anne's College\n* St Antony's College\n* St Catherine's College\n* St Cross College\n* St Edmund Hall\n* St Hilda's College\n* St Hugh's College\n* St John's College\n* St Peter's College\n* Somerville College\n* Trinity College\n* University College\n* Wadham College\n* Wolfson College\n* Worcester College\n\nThe permanent private halls were founded by different Christian denominations. One difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas colleges are governed by the fellows of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination. The four current PPHs are:\n\n\n\n* Blackfriars Hall\n* Campion Hall\n* Regent's Park College\n* Wycliffe Hall\n\n\nThe PPHs and colleges join as the Conference of Colleges, which represents the common concerns of the several colleges of the university, to discuss matters of shared interest and to act collectively when necessary, such as in dealings with the central university.[87][88] The Conference of Colleges was established as a recommendation of the Franks Commission in 1965.[89]\n\n\nTeaching members of the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, although the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments. \n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dining hall at Christ Church; the hall is an important feature of the typical Oxford college, providing a place to dine and socialise.\nIn 2017–18, the university had an income of £2,237m; key sources were research grants (£579.1m) and academic fees (£332.5m).[90] The colleges had a total income of £492.9m.[91]\n\n\nWhile the university has a larger annual income and operating budget, the colleges have a larger aggregate endowment: over £6.4bn compared to the university's £1.2bn.[4] The central University's endowment, along with some of the colleges', is managed by the university's wholly-owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007.[92] The university used to maintain substantial investments in fossil fuel companies.[93] However, in April 2020, the university committed to divest from direct investments in fossil fuel companies and to require indirect investments in fossil fuel companies be subjected to the Oxford Martin Principles.[94][95]\n\n\nThe total assets of the colleges of £6.3 billion also exceed total university assets of £4.1 billion.[91][90] The college figure does not reflect all the assets held by the colleges as their accounts do not include the cost or value of many of their main sites or heritage assets such as works of art or libraries.[96]\n\n\nThe university was one of the first in the UK to raise money through a major public fundraising campaign, the Campaign for Oxford. The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled \"Oxford Thinking – The Campaign for the University of Oxford\".[97] This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure;[98] having passed its original target of £1.25 billion in March 2012, the target was raised to £3 billion.[99] The campaign had raised a total of £2.8 billion by July 2018.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Funding criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe university has faced criticism for some of its sources of donations and funding. In 2017, attention was drawn to historical donations including All Souls College receiving £10,000 from slave trader Christopher Codrington in 1710,[100] and Oriel College having receiving taken £100,000 from the will of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes in 1902.[101][102] In 1996 a donation of £20 million was received from Wafic Saïd who was involved in the Al-Yammah arms deal,[103][104] and taking £150 million from the US billionaire businessman Stephen A. Schwarzman in 2019.[105] The university has defended its decisions saying it \"takes legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration\".\n\n\nThe university has also faced criticism, as noted above, over its decision to accept donations from fossil fuel companies having received £21.8 million from the fossil fuel industry between 2010 and 2015[106] and £18.8 million between 2015 and 2020.[107][108]\n\n\nThe university accepted £6 million from The Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust in 2021. Former racing driver Max Mosley said he set up the trust \"to house the fortune he inherited\" from his father,[109] Oswald Mosley, who was founder of two far right groups: Union Movement and the British Union of Fascists.[110]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nOxford is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, and the International Alliance of Research Universities. It is also a core member of the Europaeum and forms part of the \"golden triangle\" of highly research intensive and elite English universities.[111]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics\n|  | 2022[112] | 2021[113] | 2020[114] | 2019[115] | 2018[116] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 23,819\n | 24,338\n | 23,414\n | 23,020\n | 21,515\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 15.3\n | 14.6\n | 16.8\n | 16.9\n | 17.8\n |\n| **Enrols** | 3,271\n | 3,298\n | 3,695\n | 3,280\n | 3,309\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 89.7\n | 92.8\n | 94.0\n | 84.3\n | 86.2\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 7.28\n | 7.38\n | 6.34\n | 7.02\n | 6.50\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[117] | —\n | 205\n | 201\n | 200\n | 205\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition (2022)\n| Domicile[118] and Ethnicity[119] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 50%\n | 50 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[a] | 16%\n | 16 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 25%\n | 25 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[120][121] |\n| Female | 54%\n | 54 |\n| Private Schools | 31%\n | 31 |\n| Low Participation Areas[b] | 6%\n | 6 |\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of state-school students at Oxford and Cambridge[122][123]\nIn common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.[124] The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[125]\n\n\nTo allow a more personalised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for organ scholarships[126] and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.[127]\nOxford has the lowest offer rate of all Russell Group universities.[128]\n\n\nMost applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges. For undergraduates, these colleges work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of their college preferences. For postgraduates, all applicants who receive an offer from the university are guaranteed a college place, even if they do not receive a place at their chosen college.[129]\n\n\nUndergraduate shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most undergraduate applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. \n\n\nUndergraduate offers are sent out in early January, with each offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receives an offer from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make \"open offers\" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until A Level results day in August.[130][131]\n\n\nThe university has come under criticism for the number of students it accepts from private schools;[132] for instance, Laura Spence's rejection from the university in 2000 led to widespread debate.[133] In 2016, the University of Oxford gave 59% of offers to UK students to students from state schools, while about 93% of all UK pupils and 86% of post-16 UK pupils are educated in state schools.[134][135][136] However, 64% of UK applicants were from state schools and the university notes that state school students apply disproportionately to oversubscribed subjects.[137] The proportion of students coming from state schools has been increasing. From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%.[138] Oxford University spends over £6 million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.[134]\n\n\nIn 2018 the university's annual admissions report revealed that eight of Oxford's colleges had accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years.[139] Labour MP David Lammy said, \"This is social apartheid and it is utterly unrepresentative of life in modern Britain.\"[140] In 2020, Oxford had increased its proportion of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students to record levels.[141][142] The number of BAME undergraduates accepted to the university in 2020 rose to 684 students, or 23.6% of the UK intake, up from 558 or 22% in 2019; the number of Black students was 106 (3.7% of the intake), up from 80 students (3.2%).[142][143] UCAS data also showed that Oxford is more likely than comparable institutions to make offers to ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged pupils.[141]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and degrees[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Degrees of the University of Oxford, List of professorships at the University of Oxford, and Undergraduate education at University of Oxford\n\nUndergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1–4 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week's work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight-week academic terms: Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity.[144] (These are officially known as 'Full Term': 'Term' is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as \"first week\", the last as \"eighth week\" and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example \"noughth week\" precedes term).[145] Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities,[146] and their total duration amounts to less than half the year. However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).\n\n\nResearch degrees at the master's and doctoral level are conferred in all subjects studied at graduate level at the university.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Scholarships and financial support[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhodes House, home to the awarding body for Rhodes Scholarships, is often considered as the world's most prestigious scholarship.\nThere are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate, with a total possible grant of £10,235 over a 3-year degree. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships.[147] Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities.[148] The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards.[149][150] In 2016, Oxford University announced that it is to run its first free online economics course as part of a \"massive open online course\" (Mooc) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network.[151] The course available is called 'From Poverty to Prosperity: Understanding Economic Development'.\n\n\nStudents successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and exhibitions, normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; \"commoners\" (originally those who had to pay for their \"commons\", or food and lodging) are restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term \"scholar\" in relation to Oxford therefore has a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were \"noblemen commoners\" and \"gentlemen commoners\", but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. \"Closed\" scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.[152]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Libraries of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Clarendon Building, home to many senior Bodleian Library staff, previously housed the university's own central administration.\nThe university maintains the largest university library system in the UK,[16] and, with over 11 million volumes housed on 120 miles (190 km) of shelving, the Bodleian group is the second-largest library in the UK, after the British Library. The Bodleian is a legal deposit library, which means that it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK. As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.[153]\n\n\nThe buildings referred to as the university's main research library, The Bodleian, consist of the original Bodleian Library in the Old Schools Quadrangle, founded by Sir Thomas Bodley in 1598 and opened in 1602,[154] the Radcliffe Camera, the Clarendon Building, and the Weston Library. A tunnel underneath Broad Street connects these buildings, with the Gladstone Link, which opened to readers in 2011, connecting the Old Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera.\n\n\nThe Bodleian Libraries group was formed in 2000, bringing the Bodleian Library and some of the subject libraries together.[155] It now comprises 28[156] libraries, a number of which have been created by bringing previously separate collections together, including the Sackler Library, Law Library, Social Science Library and Radcliffe Science Library.[155] Another major product of this collaboration has been a joint integrated library system, OLIS (**O**xford **L**ibraries **I**nformation **S**ystem),[157] and its public interface, **SOLO** (**S**earch **O**xford **L**ibraries **O**nline), which provides an electronic catalogue covering all member libraries, as well as the libraries of individual colleges and other faculty libraries, which are not members of the group but do share cataloguing information.[158]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duke Humfrey's Library in the Bodleian Library\nA new book depository opened in South Marston, Swindon, in October 2010,[159] and recent building projects include the remodelling of the New Bodleian building, which was renamed the Weston Library when it reopened in 2015.[160][161] The renovation is designed to better showcase the library's various treasures (which include a Shakespeare First Folio and a Gutenberg Bible) as well as temporary exhibitions.\n\n\nThe Bodleian engaged in a mass-digitisation project with Google in 2004.[162][163] Notable electronic resources hosted by the Bodleian Group include the *Electronic Enlightenment Project*, which was awarded the 2010 Digital Prize by the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.[164]\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Museums of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Interior of the Pitt Rivers Museum\nOxford maintains a number of museums and galleries, open for free to the public. The Ashmolean Museum, founded in 1683, is the oldest museum in the UK, and the oldest university museum in the world.[165] It holds significant collections of art and archaeology, including works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Turner, and Picasso, as well as treasures such as the Scorpion Macehead, the Parian Marble and the Alfred Jewel. It also contains \"The Messiah\", a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence.[166]\n\n\nThe University Museum of Natural History holds the university's zoological, entomological and geological specimens. It is housed in a large neo-Gothic building on Parks Road, in the university's Science Area.[167][168] Among its collection are the skeletons of a *Tyrannosaurus rex* and *Triceratops*, and the most complete remains of a dodo found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy.[169]\n\n\nAdjoining the Museum of Natural History is the Pitt Rivers Museum, founded in 1884, which displays the university's archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General Augustus Pitt Rivers stipulated that the university establish a lectureship in anthropology.[170]\n\n\nThe Museum of the History of Science is housed on Broad Street in the world's oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building.[171] It contains 15,000 artefacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science. In the Faculty of Music on St Aldate's is the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. Christ Church Picture Gallery holds a large collection of old master paintings and drawings.[172]\n\n\n\n### Publishing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Oxford University Press\n\nThe Oxford University Press is the world's second oldest and currently the largest university press by the number of publications.[173] More than 6,000 new books are published annually,[174] including many reference, professional, and academic works (such as the *Oxford English Dictionary*, the *Concise Oxford English Dictionary*, the *Oxford World's Classics*, the *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography*, and the *Concise Dictionary of National Biography*).\n\n\n\n### Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[175] | 2 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[176] | 2 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[177] | 2 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[178] | 7 |\n| *QS* (2025)[179] | 3 |\n| *THE* (2024)[180] | 1 |\n\n\n![](image)University of Oxford's national league table performance over the past ten years\nOxford is regularly ranked within the top five universities in the world and is currently ranked first in the world in the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*,[181][182] as well as the Forbes's World University Rankings.[183] It held the number one position in the *Times Good University Guide* for eleven consecutive years,[184] and the medical school has also maintained first place in the \"Clinical, Pre-Clinical & Health\" table of the *Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings* for the past seven consecutive years.[185] In 2021, it ranked sixth among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[186] The *THE* has also recognised Oxford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.[187] The university is fifth worldwide on the *US News* ranking.[188] Its Saïd Business School came 13th in the world in *Financial Times* *Global MBA Ranking*.[189]\n\n\nOxford was ranked 13th in the world in 2022 by the Nature Index, which measures the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[190][191] It is ranked fifth best university worldwide and first in Britain for forming CEOs according to the *Professional Ranking World Universities*,[192] and first in the UK for the quality of its graduates as chosen by the recruiters of the UK's major companies.[193]\n\n\nIn the 2018 Complete University Guide, all 38 subjects offered by Oxford rank within the top 10 nationally meaning Oxford was one of only two multi-faculty universities (along with Cambridge) in the UK to have 100% of their subjects in the top 10.[194] Computer Science, Medicine, Philosophy, Politics and Psychology were ranked first in the UK by the guide.[195]\n\n\nAccording to the QS World University Rankings by Subject, the University of Oxford also ranks as number one in the world for four Humanities disciplines: English Language and Literature, Modern Languages, Geography, and History. It also ranks second globally for Anthropology, Archaeology, Law, Medicine, Politics & International Studies, and Psychology.[196]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)An undergraduate student at the University of Oxford in subfusc for matriculation\nAcademic dress is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held among the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations – 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum.[197] This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote not so much on making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, on abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.[198] In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.[199]\n\n\n'Trashing' is a tradition of spraying those who just finished their last examination of the year with alcohol, flour and confetti. The sprayed student stays in the academic dress worn to the exam. The custom began in the 1970s when friends of students taking their finals waited outside Oxford's Examination Schools where exams for most degrees are taken.[200]\n\n\nOther traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally, or even not at all. \n\n\n*Balls* are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in ninth week of Trinity Term, are called commemoration balls; the dress code is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. \n\n\n\n### Clubs and societies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Oxford Union's debating chamber\n![](image)Rowing at Eights Week, an annual intercollegiate bumps race\nThe Oxford Union (not to be confused with the Oxford University Student Union) is an independent debating society which hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers.\n\n\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent *Cherwell* and OUSU's *The Oxford Student*. Other publications include the *Isis* magazine, the satirical *Oxymoron*, the graduate *Oxonian Review*, the *Oxford Political Review*,[201] and the online only newspaper *The Oxford Blue*. The student radio station is Oxide Radio.\n\n\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as cuppers (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard university wide groups. Significant focus is given to annual varsity matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is The Boat Race, watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, Torpids, and Summer Eights. A blue is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. \n\n\nParty political groups include Oxford University Conservative Association and Oxford University Labour Club.\n\n\nMusic, drama, and other arts societies exist both at the collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Oxford Revue. Most colleges have chapel choirs. The Oxford Imps, a comedy improvisation troupe, perform weekly at The Jericho Tavern during term time.[202] The Imps first performed at the Wheatsheaf pub in Oxford High Street in January 2004,[203] and have performed at the Edinburgh Fringe[204] and overseas.\n\n\nMost academic areas have student societies of some form, for example the Scientific Society. \n\n\nPrivate members' clubs for students include Vincent's Club (primarily for sportspeople)[205] and The Gridiron Club.[206] A number of invitation-only student dining clubs also exist, including the Bullingdon Club.\n\n\n\n### Student union and common rooms[edit]\n\n\nThe Oxford University Student Union, formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU,[207] exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. \n\n\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) \n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of University of Oxford people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Oxford\n\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. A total of 70 Nobel prize-winners have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.[17]\nMore information on notable members of the university can be found in the individual college articles. An individual may be associated with two or more colleges, as an undergraduate, postgraduate and/or member of staff.\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nBritish Prime Ministers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nClement Attlee, University College\n![](image)\nMargaret Thatcher, Somerville College\n![](image)\nRishi Sunak, Lincoln College\n\nThirty British prime ministers have attended Oxford, including William Gladstone, H. H. Asquith, Clement Attlee, Harold Macmillan, Edward Heath, Harold Wilson, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Of all the post-war prime ministers, only Gordon Brown was educated at a university other than Oxford (the University of Edinburgh), while Winston Churchill, James Callaghan and John Major never attended a university.[208]\n\n\nOver 100 Oxford alumni were elected to the House of Commons in 2010.[208] This includes former Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, and numerous members of the cabinet and shadow cabinet. Additionally, over 140 Oxonians sit in the House of Lords.[17]\n\n\n\nInternational leaders who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nAung San Suu Kyi, St Hugh's College\n![](image)\nIndira Gandhi, Somerville College\n![](image)\nBill Clinton, University College\n\nAt least 30 other international leaders have been educated at Oxford.[17] This number includes Harald V of Norway,[209] Abdullah II of Jordan,[17] William II of the Netherlands, five Prime Ministers of Australia (John Gorton, Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, Tony Abbott, and Malcolm Turnbull),[210][211][212] six Prime Ministers of Pakistan (Liaquat Ali Khan, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Sir Feroz Khan Noon, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto and Imran Khan),[17] two Prime Ministers of Canada (Lester B. Pearson and John Turner),[17][213] two Prime Ministers of India (Manmohan Singh and Indira Gandhi, though the latter did not finish her degree),[17][214] S. W. R. D.

Bill Clinton is the first President of the United States to have attended Oxford; he attended as a Rhodes Scholar.[17][217] Arthur Mutambara (Deputy Prime Minister of Zimbabwe), was a Rhodes Scholar in 1991. Seretse Khama, first president of Botswana, spent a year at Balliol College. Festus Mogae (former president of Botswana) was a student at University College. The Burmese democracy activist and Nobel laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, was a student of St Hugh's College.[218] Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the current reigning Druk Gyalpo (Dragon King) of Bhutan, was a member of Magdalen College.[219] The world's youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, completed a BA in philosophy, politics and economics.[220]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nLawyers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nDavid Neuberger, Christ Church\n![](image)\nRonald Dworkin, Magdalen College\n![](image)\nElena Kagan, Worcester College\nOxford has produced a large number of distinguished jurists, judges and lawyers around the world. Lords Bingham and Denning, commonly recognised as two of the most influential English judges in the history of the common law,[221][222][223][224] both studied at Oxford. Within the United Kingdom, three of the current justices of the Supreme Court are Oxford-educated: Robert Reed (Deputy President of the Supreme Court), Nicholas Wilson, and Michael Briggs;[225] retired Justices include David Neuberger (President of the Supreme Court 2012–2017), Jonathan Mance (Deputy President of the Supreme Court 2017–2018), Alan Rodger, Jonathan Sumption, Mark Saville, John Dyson, and Simon Brown. The twelve Lord Chancellors and nine Lord Chief Justices that have been educated at Oxford include Stanley Buckmaster, Thomas More,[226] Thomas Wolsey,[227] Gavin Simonds.[228] The twenty-two Law Lords count amongst them Lennie Hoffmann, Kenneth Diplock, Richard Wilberforce, James Atkin, Nick Browne-Wilkinson, Robert Goff, Brian Hutton, Jonathan Mance, Alan Rodger, Mark Saville, Leslie Scarman, Johan Steyn;[229] Master of the Rolls Wilfrid Greene;[224] Lord Justices of Appeal include John Laws, Brian Leveson and John Mummery.

Note, however, that any university which does not want funding from HEFCE can, as a private corporation, charge whatever tuition fees it likes (exactly as does, say, the University of Buckingham or BPP University College). Under existing legislation and outside of the influence of the HEFCE-funding mechanism upon universities, Government can no more control university tuition fees than it can dictate the price of socks in Marks & Spencer. Universities are not part of the State and they are not part of the public sector; Government has no reserve powers of intervention even in a failing institution.\n87. **^** \"Conference of Colleges\".

There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][11][12] It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[13] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford is made up of thirty-nine semi-autonomous constituent colleges, four permanent private halls, and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions.[14] All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college.[15] It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided in a predominantly centralised fashion.\n\n\nOxford operates the Ashmolean Museum, the world's oldest university museum; Oxford University Press, the largest university press in the world; and the largest academic library system nationwide.[16] In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2022, the university had a total consolidated income of £2.78 billion, of which £711.4 million was from research grants and contracts.[4]\n\n\nOxford has educated a wide range of notable alumni, including 30 prime ministers of the United Kingdom and many heads of state and government around the world.[17] As of October 2022,[update] 73 Nobel Prize laureates, 4 Fields Medalists, and 6 Turing Award winners have matriculated, worked, or held visiting fellowships at the University of Oxford, while its alumni have won 160 Olympic medals.[18] Oxford is the home of numerous scholarships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, one of the oldest international graduate scholarship programmes.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Oxford\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Merton College's Mob Quad, the oldest quadrangle of the university, constructed between 1288 and 1378\n![](image)In 1605, Oxford was still a walled city, but several colleges had been built outside the city walls (north is at the bottom on this map).\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Balliol College, one of the university's oldest constituent colleges\nThe University of Oxford's foundation date is unknown.[19] It is known that teaching at Oxford existed in some form as early as 1096, but it is unclear when the university came into being.[2] The scholar Theobald of Étampes lectured at Oxford in the early 1100s.\n\n\nIt grew quickly from 1167 when English students returned from the University of Paris.[2] The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188, and the first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a *universitas* or corporation in 1231.[2][20] The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during the reign of King Henry III.[21]\n\n\nAfter disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled from the violence to Cambridge, later forming the University of Cambridge.[13][22]\n\n\nThe students associated together on the basis of geographical origins, into two 'nations', representing the North (*northerners* or *Boreales*, who included the English people from north of the River Trent and the Scots) and the South (*southerners* or *Australes*, who included English people from south of the Trent, the Irish and the Welsh).[23][24] In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students' affiliations when membership of a college or hall became customary in Oxford. In addition, members of many religious orders, including Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites and Augustinians, settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence and maintained houses or halls for students.[25] At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest such founders were William of Durham, who in 1249 endowed University College,[25] and John Balliol, father of a future King of Scots; Balliol College bears his name.[23] Another founder, Walter de Merton, a Lord Chancellor of England and afterwards Bishop of Rochester, devised a series of regulations for college life;[26][27] Merton College thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford,[28] as well as at the University of Cambridge. Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.[25]\n\n\nIn 1333–1334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III.[29] Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### Renaissance period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An engraving of Christ Church, Oxford, 1742\nThe new learning of the Renaissance greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn, who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies,[32] and John Colet, the noted biblical scholar.[33]\n\n\nWith the English Reformation and the breaking of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai.[34] The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.[35]\n\n\nIn 1636,[36] William Laud, the chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury, codified the university's statutes. These, to a large extent, remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press, and he made significant contributions to the Bodleian Library, the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to receive the BA degree from the university and \"dissenters\" were only permitted to receive the MA in 1871.[37]\n\n\nThe university was a centre of the Royalist party during the English Civil War (1642–1649), while the town favoured the opposing Parliamentarian cause.[38]\n\n\n\n![Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College](image)Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College\nWadham College, founded in 1610, was the undergraduate college of Sir Christopher Wren.\n\n\nWren was part of a brilliant group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the Oxford Philosophical Club, which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group, which has at times been linked with Boyle's \"Invisible College\" held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the college's Warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus that went on to found the Royal Society.[39]\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\n#### Students[edit]\n\n\nBefore reforms in the early 19th century, the curriculum at Oxford was notoriously narrow and impractical. Sir Spencer Walpole, a historian of contemporary Britain and a senior government official, had not attended any university. He said, \"Few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quoted the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\"[40] Nevertheless, Walpole argued:\n\n\n\n\n>  Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.[41]\n> \n> \n\n\nOut of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (59% as Anglican clergy). Out of the students who matriculated in 1870, 59% were sons of professionals (25% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (42% as Anglican clergy).[42][43]\n\n\nM. C. Curthoys and H. S. Jones argue that the rise of organised sport was one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton, Winchester, Shrewsbury, and Harrow.[44]\n\n\nAll students, regardless of their chosen area of study, were required to spend (at least) their first year preparing for a first-year examination that was heavily focused on classical languages. Science students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with Greek language study removed from their required courses. This concept of a Bachelor of Science had been adopted at other European universities (London University had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.[45]\n\n\nAt the start of 1914, the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War, many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total.[46] The University Roll of Service records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed.[47] Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, 'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914–1918'. During the war years the university buildings became hospitals, cadet schools and military training camps.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Reforms[edit]\n\n\nTwo parliamentary commissions in 1852 issued recommendations for Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[48][49]\n\n\nThe system of separate honour schools for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and Literae Humaniores.[50] Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853.[50] By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\". Theology became the sixth honour school.[51] In addition to these B.A. Honours degrees, the postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) was, and still is, offered.[52]\n\n\nThe mid-19th century saw the impact of the Oxford Movement (1833–1845), led among others by the future Cardinal John Henry Newman. \n\n\nAdministrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, and the establishment of four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford began to award doctorates for research in the first third of the 20th century. The first Oxford DPhil in mathematics was awarded in 1921.[53]\n\n\nThe list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to politics, the sciences, medicine, and literature. As of October 2022, 73 Nobel laureates and more than 50 world leaders have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.[17]\n\n\n\n### Women's education[edit]\n\n\nFirst two women's colleges\n![](image)\nLady Margaret Hall, founded in 1878\n![](image)\nSomerville College, founded in 1879\n\nThe university passed a statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level;[54] for a brief period in the early 1900s, this allowed the \"steamboat ladies\" to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[55] In June 1878, the *Association for the Education of Women* (AEW) was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, T. H. Green and Edward Stuart Talbot. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group founded Lady Margaret Hall in 1878, while T. H. Green founded the non-denominational Somerville College in 1879.[56] Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville opened their doors to their first 21 students (12 from Somerville, 9 from Lady Margaret Hall) in 1879, who attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop.[54] There were also 25 women students living at home or with friends in 1879, a group which evolved into the Society of Oxford Home-Students and in 1952 into St Anne's College.[57][58]\n\n\nThese first three societies for women were followed by St Hugh's (1886)[59] and St Hilda's (1893).[60] All of these colleges later became coeducational, starting with Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne's in 1979,[61][62] and finishing with St Hilda's, which began to accept male students in 2008.[63] In the early 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege,[64] however the integration of women into Oxford moved forward during the First World War. In 1916 women were admitted as medical students on a par with men, and in 1917 the university accepted financial responsibility for women's examinations.[46]\n\n\nOn 7 October 1920 women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees.[65] In 1927 the university's dons created a quota that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957.[54] However, during this period Oxford colleges were single sex, so the number of women was also limited by the capacity of the women's colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status.[66]\n\n\nIn 1974, Brasenose, Jesus, Wadham, Hertford and St Catherine's became the first previously all-male colleges to admit women.[67][68] The majority of men's colleges accepted their first female students in 1979,[68] with Christ Church following in 1980,[69] and Oriel becoming the last men's college to admit women in 1985.[70] Most of Oxford's graduate colleges were founded as coeducational establishments in the 20th century, with the exception of St Antony's, which was founded as a men's college in 1950 and began to accept women only in 1962.[71] By 1988, 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female;[72] in 2016, 45% of the student population, and 47% of undergraduate students, were female.[73][74]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Oxford announced that starting the following academic year, history students may choose to sit a take-home exam in some courses, with the intention that this will equalise rates of firsts awarded to women and men at Oxford.[75] That same summer, maths and computer science tests were extended by 15 minutes, in a bid to see if female student scores would improve.[76][77]\n\n\nThe detective novel *Gaudy Night* by Dorothy L. Sayers, herself one of the first women to gain an academic degree from Oxford, is largely set in the all-female Shrewsbury College, Oxford (based on Sayers' own Somerville College[78]), and the issue of women's education is central to its plot. Social historian and Somerville College alumna Jane Robinson's book *Bluestockings: A Remarkable History of the First Women to Fight for an Education* gives a very detailed and immersive account of this history.[79]\n\n\n\n## Buildings and sites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Scrollable image*.

heavily in new facilities at the laboratory in recent years.\n![](image)Sheldonian Theatre, built by Christopher Wren between 1664 and 1668, hosts the university's Congregation and its concerts and degree ceremonies.\nThe university is a \"city university\" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. The Science Area, in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) Radcliffe Observatory Quarter in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIconic university buildings include the Radcliffe Camera, the Sheldonian Theatre used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the Examination Schools, where examinations and some lectures take place. The University Church of St Mary the Virgin was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian. Christ Church Cathedral uniquely serves as both a college chapel and as a cathedral.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2012–2013, the university built the controversial one-hectare (400 m × 25 m) Castle Mill development of 4–5-storey blocks of student flats overlooking Cripley Meadow and the historic Port Meadow, blocking views of the spires in the city centre.[80] The development has been likened to building a \"skyscraper beside Stonehenge\".[81]\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Summer in the Botanic Garden\nThe University Parks are a 70-acre (28 ha) parkland area in the northeast of the city, near Keble College, Somerville College and Lady Margaret Hall. It is open to the public during daylight hours. \n\n\nThe Botanic Garden on the High Street is the oldest botanic garden in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on 1.8 ha (4+1⁄2 acres). It is one of the most diverse yet compact major collections of plants in the world and includes representatives of over 90% of the higher plant families. The Harcourt Arboretum is a 130-acre (53 ha) site six miles (9.7 km) south of the city that includes native woodland and 67 acres (27 hectares) of meadow. The 1,000-acre (4.0 km2) Wytham Woods are owned by the university and used for research in zoology and climate change.[82]\n\n\nThere are also various college-owned open spaces open to the public, including Bagley Wood and most notably Christ Church Meadow.[83]\n\n\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Departments of the University of Oxford\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Central governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wellington Square has become synonymous with the university's central administration.\nThe university's formal head is the Chancellor, currently Lord Patten of Barnes, though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figurehead and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of Convocation, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.[84]\n\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor, currently Irene Tracey,[6] is the *de facto* head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. \n\n\nTwo university proctors, elected annually on a rotating basis from any two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student discipline and complaints, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings.[85] The university's professors are collectively referred to as the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the Chichele Professorships and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy. \n\n\nThe University of Oxford is only a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.[86]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Tom Quad, Christ Church\n![](image)Main Quad, Worcester College\nTo be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall. There are thirty-nine colleges of the University of Oxford and four permanent private halls (PPHs), each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities.[15] Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.\n\n\nThe colleges are:\n\n\n\n* All Souls College\n* Balliol College\n* Brasenose College\n* Christ Church\n* Corpus Christi College\n* Exeter College\n* Green Templeton College\n* Harris Manchester College\n* Hertford College\n* Jesus College\n* Keble College\n* Kellogg College\n* Lady Margaret Hall\n* Linacre College\n* Lincoln College\n* Magdalen College\n* Mansfield College\n* Merton College\n* New College\n* Nuffield College\n* Oriel College\n* Pembroke College\n* The Queen's College\n* Reuben College\n* St Anne's College\n* St Antony's College\n* St Catherine's College\n* St Cross College\n* St Edmund Hall\n* St Hilda's College\n* St Hugh's College\n* St John's College\n* St Peter's College\n* Somerville College\n* Trinity College\n* University College\n* Wadham College\n* Wolfson College\n* Worcester College\n\nThe permanent private halls were founded by different Christian denominations. One difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas colleges are governed by the fellows of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination. The four current PPHs are:\n\n\n\n* Blackfriars Hall\n* Campion Hall\n* Regent's Park College\n* Wycliffe Hall\n\n\nThe PPHs and colleges join as the Conference of Colleges, which represents the common concerns of the several colleges of the university, to discuss matters of shared interest and to act collectively when necessary, such as in dealings with the central university.[87][88] The Conference of Colleges was established as a recommendation of the Franks Commission in 1965.[89]\n\n\nTeaching members of the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, although the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments. \n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dining hall at Christ Church; the hall is an important feature of the typical Oxford college, providing a place to dine and socialise.\nIn 2017–18, the university had an income of £2,237m; key sources were research grants (£579.1m) and academic fees (£332.5m).[90] The colleges had a total income of £492.9m.[91]\n\n\nWhile the university has a larger annual income and operating budget, the colleges have a larger aggregate endowment: over £6.4bn compared to the university's £1.2bn.[4] The central University's endowment, along with some of the colleges', is managed by the university's wholly-owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007.[92] The university used to maintain substantial investments in fossil fuel companies.[93] However, in April 2020, the university committed to divest from direct investments in fossil fuel companies and to require indirect investments in fossil fuel companies be subjected to the Oxford Martin Principles.[94][95]\n\n\nThe total assets of the colleges of £6.3 billion also exceed total university assets of £4.1 billion.[91][90] The college figure does not reflect all the assets held by the colleges as their accounts do not include the cost or value of many of their main sites or heritage assets such as works of art or libraries.[96]\n\n\nThe university was one of the first in the UK to raise money through a major public fundraising campaign, the Campaign for Oxford. The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled \"Oxford Thinking – The Campaign for the University of Oxford\".[97] This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure;[98] having passed its original target of £1.25 billion in March 2012, the target was raised to £3 billion.[99] The campaign had raised a total of £2.8 billion by July 2018.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Funding criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe university has faced criticism for some of its sources of donations and funding. In 2017, attention was drawn to historical donations including All Souls College receiving £10,000 from slave trader Christopher Codrington in 1710,[100] and Oriel College having receiving taken £100,000 from the will of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes in 1902.[101][102] In 1996 a donation of £20 million was received from Wafic Saïd who was involved in the Al-Yammah arms deal,[103][104] and taking £150 million from the US billionaire businessman Stephen A. Schwarzman in 2019.[105] The university has defended its decisions saying it \"takes legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration\".\n\n\nThe university has also faced criticism, as noted above, over its decision to accept donations from fossil fuel companies having received £21.8 million from the fossil fuel industry between 2010 and 2015[106] and £18.8 million between 2015 and 2020.[107][108]\n\n\nThe university accepted £6 million from The Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust in 2021. Former racing driver Max Mosley said he set up the trust \"to house the fortune he inherited\" from his father,[109] Oswald Mosley, who was founder of two far right groups: Union Movement and the British Union of Fascists.[110]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nOxford is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, and the International Alliance of Research Universities. It is also a core member of the Europaeum and forms part of the \"golden triangle\" of highly research intensive and elite English universities.[111]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics\n|  | 2022[112] | 2021[113] | 2020[114] | 2019[115] | 2018[116] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 23,819\n | 24,338\n | 23,414\n | 23,020\n | 21,515\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 15.3\n | 14.6\n | 16.8\n | 16.9\n | 17.8\n |\n| **Enrols** | 3,271\n | 3,298\n | 3,695\n | 3,280\n | 3,309\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 89.7\n | 92.8\n | 94.0\n | 84.3\n | 86.2\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 7.28\n | 7.38\n | 6.34\n | 7.02\n | 6.50\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[117] | —\n | 205\n | 201\n | 200\n | 205\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition (2022)\n| Domicile[118] and Ethnicity[119] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 50%\n | 50 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[a] | 16%\n | 16 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 25%\n | 25 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[120][121] |\n| Female | 54%\n | 54 |\n| Private Schools | 31%\n | 31 |\n| Low Participation Areas[b] | 6%\n | 6 |\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of state-school students at Oxford and Cambridge[122][123]\nIn common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.[124] The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[125]\n\n\nTo allow a more personalised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for organ scholarships[126] and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.[127]\nOxford has the lowest offer rate of all Russell Group universities.[128]\n\n\nMost applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges. For undergraduates, these colleges work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of their college preferences. For postgraduates, all applicants who receive an offer from the university are guaranteed a college place, even if they do not receive a place at their chosen college.[129]\n\n\nUndergraduate shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most undergraduate applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. \n\n\nUndergraduate offers are sent out in early January, with each offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receives an offer from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make \"open offers\" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until A Level results day in August.[130][131]\n\n\nThe university has come under criticism for the number of students it accepts from private schools;[132] for instance, Laura Spence's rejection from the university in 2000 led to widespread debate.[133] In 2016, the University of Oxford gave 59% of offers to UK students to students from state schools, while about 93% of all UK pupils and 86% of post-16 UK pupils are educated in state schools.[134][135][136] However, 64% of UK applicants were from state schools and the university notes that state school students apply disproportionately to oversubscribed subjects.[137] The proportion of students coming from state schools has been increasing. From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%.[138] Oxford University spends over £6 million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.[134]\n\n\nIn 2018 the university's annual admissions report revealed that eight of Oxford's colleges had accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years.[139] Labour MP David Lammy said, \"This is social apartheid and it is utterly unrepresentative of life in modern Britain.\"[140] In 2020, Oxford had increased its proportion of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students to record levels.[141][142] The number of BAME undergraduates accepted to the university in 2020 rose to 684 students, or 23.6% of the UK intake, up from 558 or 22% in 2019; the number of Black students was 106 (3.7% of the intake), up from 80 students (3.2%).[142][143] UCAS data also showed that Oxford is more likely than comparable institutions to make offers to ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged pupils.[141]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and degrees[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Degrees of the University of Oxford, List of professorships at the University of Oxford, and Undergraduate education at University of Oxford\n\nUndergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1–4 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week's work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight-week academic terms: Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity.[144] (These are officially known as 'Full Term': 'Term' is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as \"first week\", the last as \"eighth week\" and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example \"noughth week\" precedes term).[145] Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities,[146] and their total duration amounts to less than half the year. However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).\n\n\nResearch degrees at the master's and doctoral level are conferred in all subjects studied at graduate level at the university.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Scholarships and financial support[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhodes House, home to the awarding body for Rhodes Scholarships, is often considered as the world's most prestigious scholarship.\nThere are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate, with a total possible grant of £10,235 over a 3-year degree. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships.[147] Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities.[148] The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards.[149][150] In 2016, Oxford University announced that it is to run its first free online economics course as part of a \"massive open online course\" (Mooc) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network.[151] The course available is called 'From Poverty to Prosperity: Understanding Economic Development'.\n\n\nStudents successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and exhibitions, normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; \"commoners\" (originally those who had to pay for their \"commons\", or food and lodging) are restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term \"scholar\" in relation to Oxford therefore has a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were \"noblemen commoners\" and \"gentlemen commoners\", but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. \"Closed\" scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.[152]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Libraries of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Clarendon Building, home to many senior Bodleian Library staff, previously housed the university's own central administration.\nThe university maintains the largest university library system in the UK,[16] and, with over 11 million volumes housed on 120 miles (190 km) of shelving, the Bodleian group is the second-largest library in the UK, after the British Library. The Bodleian is a legal deposit library, which means that it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK. As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.[153]\n\n\nThe buildings referred to as the university's main research library, The Bodleian, consist of the original Bodleian Library in the Old Schools Quadrangle, founded by Sir Thomas Bodley in 1598 and opened in 1602,[154] the Radcliffe Camera, the Clarendon Building, and the Weston Library. A tunnel underneath Broad Street connects these buildings, with the Gladstone Link, which opened to readers in 2011, connecting the Old Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera.\n\n\nThe Bodleian Libraries group was formed in 2000, bringing the Bodleian Library and some of the subject libraries together.[155] It now comprises 28[156] libraries, a number of which have been created by bringing previously separate collections together, including the Sackler Library, Law Library, Social Science Library and Radcliffe Science Library.[155] Another major product of this collaboration has been a joint integrated library system, OLIS (**O**xford **L**ibraries **I**nformation **S**ystem),[157] and its public interface, **SOLO** (**S**earch **O**xford **L**ibraries **O**nline), which provides an electronic catalogue covering all member libraries, as well as the libraries of individual colleges and other faculty libraries, which are not members of the group but do share cataloguing information.[158]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duke Humfrey's Library in the Bodleian Library\nA new book depository opened in South Marston, Swindon, in October 2010,[159] and recent building projects include the remodelling of the New Bodleian building, which was renamed the Weston Library when it reopened in 2015.[160][161] The renovation is designed to better showcase the library's various treasures (which include a Shakespeare First Folio and a Gutenberg Bible) as well as temporary exhibitions.\n\n\nThe Bodleian engaged in a mass-digitisation project with Google in 2004.[162][163] Notable electronic resources hosted by the Bodleian Group include the *Electronic Enlightenment Project*, which was awarded the 2010 Digital Prize by the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.[164]\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Museums of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Interior of the Pitt Rivers Museum\nOxford maintains a number of museums and galleries, open for free to the public. The Ashmolean Museum, founded in 1683, is the oldest museum in the UK, and the oldest university museum in the world.[165] It holds significant collections of art and archaeology, including works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Turner, and Picasso, as well as treasures such as the Scorpion Macehead, the Parian Marble and the Alfred Jewel. It also contains \"The Messiah\", a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence.[166]\n\n\nThe University Museum of Natural History holds the university's zoological, entomological and geological specimens. It is housed in a large neo-Gothic building on Parks Road, in the university's Science Area.[167][168] Among its collection are the skeletons of a *Tyrannosaurus rex* and *Triceratops*, and the most complete remains of a dodo found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy.[169]\n\n\nAdjoining the Museum of Natural History is the Pitt Rivers Museum, founded in 1884, which displays the university's archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General Augustus Pitt Rivers stipulated that the university establish a lectureship in anthropology.[170]\n\n\nThe Museum of the History of Science is housed on Broad Street in the world's oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building.[171] It contains 15,000 artefacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science. In the Faculty of Music on St Aldate's is the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. Christ Church Picture Gallery holds a large collection of old master paintings and drawings.[172]\n\n\n\n### Publishing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Oxford University Press\n\nThe Oxford University Press is the world's second oldest and currently the largest university press by the number of publications.[173] More than 6,000 new books are published annually,[174] including many reference, professional, and academic works (such as the *Oxford English Dictionary*, the *Concise Oxford English Dictionary*, the *Oxford World's Classics*, the *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography*, and the *Concise Dictionary of National Biography*).\n\n\n\n### Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[175] | 2 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[176] | 2 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[177] | 2 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[178] | 7 |\n| *QS* (2025)[179] | 3 |\n| *THE* (2024)[180] | 1 |\n\n\n![](image)University of Oxford's national league table performance over the past ten years\nOxford is regularly ranked within the top five universities in the world and is currently ranked first in the world in the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*,[181][182] as well as the Forbes's World University Rankings.[183] It held the number one position in the *Times Good University Guide* for eleven consecutive years,[184] and the medical school has also maintained first place in the \"Clinical, Pre-Clinical & Health\" table of the *Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings* for the past seven consecutive years.[185] In 2021, it ranked sixth among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[186] The *THE* has also recognised Oxford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.[187] The university is fifth worldwide on the *US News* ranking.[188] Its Saïd Business School came 13th in the world in *Financial Times* *Global MBA Ranking*.[189]\n\n\nOxford was ranked 13th in the world in 2022 by the Nature Index, which measures the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[190][191] It is ranked fifth best university worldwide and first in Britain for forming CEOs according to the *Professional Ranking World Universities*,[192] and first in the UK for the quality of its graduates as chosen by the recruiters of the UK's major companies.[193]\n\n\nIn the 2018 Complete University Guide, all 38 subjects offered by Oxford rank within the top 10 nationally meaning Oxford was one of only two multi-faculty universities (along with Cambridge) in the UK to have 100% of their subjects in the top 10.[194] Computer Science, Medicine, Philosophy, Politics and Psychology were ranked first in the UK by the guide.[195]\n\n\nAccording to the QS World University Rankings by Subject, the University of Oxford also ranks as number one in the world for four Humanities disciplines: English Language and Literature, Modern Languages, Geography, and History. It also ranks second globally for Anthropology, Archaeology, Law, Medicine, Politics & International Studies, and Psychology.[196]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)An undergraduate student at the University of Oxford in subfusc for matriculation\nAcademic dress is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held among the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations – 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum.[197] This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote not so much on making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, on abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.[198] In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.[199]\n\n\n'Trashing' is a tradition of spraying those who just finished their last examination of the year with alcohol, flour and confetti. The sprayed student stays in the academic dress worn to the exam. The custom began in the 1970s when friends of students taking their finals waited outside Oxford's Examination Schools where exams for most degrees are taken.[200]\n\n\nOther traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally, or even not at all. \n\n\n*Balls* are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in ninth week of Trinity Term, are called commemoration balls; the dress code is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. \n\n\n\n### Clubs and societies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Oxford Union's debating chamber\n![](image)Rowing at Eights Week, an annual intercollegiate bumps race\nThe Oxford Union (not to be confused with the Oxford University Student Union) is an independent debating society which hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers.\n\n\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent *Cherwell* and OUSU's *The Oxford Student*. Other publications include the *Isis* magazine, the satirical *Oxymoron*, the graduate *Oxonian Review*, the *Oxford Political Review*,[201] and the online only newspaper *The Oxford Blue*. The student radio station is Oxide Radio.\n\n\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as cuppers (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard university wide groups. Significant focus is given to annual varsity matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is The Boat Race, watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, Torpids, and Summer Eights. A blue is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. \n\n\nParty political groups include Oxford University Conservative Association and Oxford University Labour Club.\n\n\nMusic, drama, and other arts societies exist both at the collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Oxford Revue. Most colleges have chapel choirs. The Oxford Imps, a comedy improvisation troupe, perform weekly at The Jericho Tavern during term time.[202] The Imps first performed at the Wheatsheaf pub in Oxford High Street in January 2004,[203] and have performed at the Edinburgh Fringe[204] and overseas.\n\n\nMost academic areas have student societies of some form, for example the Scientific Society. \n\n\nPrivate members' clubs for students include Vincent's Club (primarily for sportspeople)[205] and The Gridiron Club.[206] A number of invitation-only student dining clubs also exist, including the Bullingdon Club.\n\n\n\n### Student union and common rooms[edit]\n\n\nThe Oxford University Student Union, formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU,[207] exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. \n\n\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) \n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of University of Oxford people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Oxford\n\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. A total of 70 Nobel prize-winners have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.[17]\nMore information on notable members of the university can be found in the individual college articles. An individual may be associated with two or more colleges, as an undergraduate, postgraduate and/or member of staff.\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nBritish Prime Ministers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nClement Attlee, University College\n![](image)\nMargaret Thatcher, Somerville College\n![](image)\nRishi Sunak, Lincoln College\n\nThirty British prime ministers have attended Oxford, including William Gladstone, H.

Note, however, that any university which does not want funding from HEFCE can, as a private corporation, charge whatever tuition fees it likes (exactly as does, say, the University of Buckingham or BPP University College). Under existing legislation and outside of the influence of the HEFCE-funding mechanism upon universities, Government can no more control university tuition fees than it can dictate the price of socks in Marks & Spencer.

It was founded in 1218 by King Alfonso IX. It is the oldest university in the Hispanic world and one of the oldest in the world in continuous operation. It has over 30,000 students from 50 different nationalities.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The university was founded as a *studium generale* by the Leonese king Alfonso IX in 1218 as the *scholas Salamanticae*, with the actual creation of the university (or the transformation of the existing school into the university) occurring between August 1218 and the following winter.[1] A further royal charter from King Alfonso X, dated 8 May 1254, established rules for the organisation and financial endowment of the university, and referred to it for the first time by that name.[10] A papal bull of Alexander IV in 1255 confirmed the Royal Charter of Alfonso X and granted universal recognition to the university's degrees.[11]\n\n\nThe historical phrases *Quod natura non dat, Salmantica non praestat* (what nature does not give, Salamanca does not lend, in Latin) and *Multos et doctissimos Salmantica habet* (many and very versed Salamanca has) give an idea of the prestige the institution rapidly acquired.[12][*failed verification*]\n\n\nIn the reign of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, the Spanish government was revamped. Contemporary with the Spanish Inquisition, the expulsion of the Jews and Muslims, and the conquest of Granada, there was a certain professionalization of the apparatus of the state. This involved the massive employment of \"letrados\", i.e., bureaucrats and lawyers, who were \"licenciados\" (university graduates), particularly, of Salamanca, and the newly founded University of Alcalá. These men staffed the various councils of state, including, eventually, the Consejo de Indias and Casa de Contratacion, the two highest bodies in metropolitan Spain for the government of the Spanish Empire in the New World.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWhile Columbus was lobbying the King and Queen for a contract to seek out a western route to the Indies, he made his case to a council of geographers at the University of Salamanca. While the geographers were skeptical of Columbus and his voyage calculations, the University of Salamanca always defended the theory of unknown territories to the west, and supported Columbus' voyage, believing that new territories may be discovered. In the next century, the morality and laws of colonization in the Indies were debated by the School of Salamanca, along with the development of the study of science, geography and cartography of the Americas, and as well as the study of general subjects of economics, philosophy and theology.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nLike Oxford and Cambridge, Salamanca had a number of colleges (*Colegios Mayores*). These were founded as charitable institutions to enable poor scholars to attend the university. By the eighteenth century they had become closed corporations controlled by the families of their founders, and dominated the university between them. Most were destroyed by Napoleon's troops. In the 19th century, the Spanish government dissolved the university's faculties of canon law and theology. They were later reestablished in the 1940s as part of the Pontifical University of Salamanca.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Related affairs[edit]\n\n\nThe faculty renovated the theology department, laid the foundation for modern-day law, international law, modern economic science and actively participated in the Council of Trent. The school's mathematicians studied the calendar reform, commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII and proposed the solution that was later implemented. By 1580, 6,500 new students had arrived at Salamanca each year, amongst the graduates were state officials of the Spanish monarchy administration. It was also during this period when the first female university students were probably admitted, Beatriz Galindo and Luisa de Medrano, the latter probably being the first woman ever to give classes at a university.[13]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Sorcery[edit]\n\n\nIn popular belief, the university was associated with sorcery. A certain cave in Salamanca was considered the site of a school of black magic. In Spanish, Salamanca may mean \"cave\", \"an evil iguana\" and \"hand trick\"[14] and the *salamanquesa* (*Tarentola mauritanica*, the Spanish name is also derived from \"salamander\") is a reptile with magical attributes in Spanish tradition.[15]\nIn Romanian folklore, the devil runs a school of black magic named *Scholomance*.\n\n\nThe name is derived from \"Salamanca\" and the wise king \"Solomon\".[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Present day[edit]\n\n\nSalamanca draws undergraduate and graduate students from across Spain and the world; it is the top-ranked university in Spain based on the number of students coming from other regions.[18] It is also known for its Spanish courses for non-native speakers, which attract more than two thousand foreign students each year.[19]\n\n\nToday, the University of Salamanca is an important center for the study of humanities and is particularly noted for its language studies, as well as in laws and economics. Scientific research is carried out in the university and research centers associated with it, such as at the Centro de Investigación del Cáncer [Cancer Research Centre],[20] Instituto de Neurociencias de Castilla y León or INCyL [Institute of Neuroscience of Castile and León],[21] Centro de Láseres Pulsados Ultracortos Ultraintensos [Ultrashort Ultraintense Pulse Lasers Centre]. It is one of only two Hispanophone universities in the world that have a MoU with the United Nations to train language professionals for the organization.[22] In conjunction with the University of Cambridge, the University of Salamanca co-founded the Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE) in 1989.\n\n\nIn 2018, the institution celebrated its eighth centennial.[23]\n\n\n\n## Library[edit]\n\n\nThe library holds about 906,000 volumes.[24]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Notable staff[edit]\n\n\n* Juan de Galavís, professor of theology; later became Archbishop of Santo Domingo and Archbishop of Bogotá\n* Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola, professor of Philosophy of Law and Natural Law\n* Enrique Gil Robles, professor of Natural Law\n* Paul Nuñez Coronel (d.1534), professor of Hebrew\n* Miguel de Unamuno, writer\n* Beatriz Galindo, (d. 1534), professor of Latin and rhetoric\n* Luisa de Medrano (d. 1527) professor of Latin.

While the geographers were skeptical of Columbus and his voyage calculations, the University of Salamanca always defended the theory of unknown territories to the west, and supported Columbus' voyage, believing that new territories may be discovered. In the next century, the morality and laws of colonization in the Indies were debated by the School of Salamanca, along with the development of the study of science, geography and cartography of the Americas, and as well as the study of general subjects of economics, philosophy and theology.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nLike Oxford and Cambridge, Salamanca had a number of colleges (*Colegios Mayores*). These were founded as charitable institutions to enable poor scholars to attend the university. By the eighteenth century they had become closed corporations controlled by the families of their founders, and dominated the university between them. Most were destroyed by Napoleon's troops. In the 19th century, the Spanish government dissolved the university's faculties of canon law and theology. They were later reestablished in the 1940s as part of the Pontifical University of Salamanca.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Related affairs[edit]\n\n\nThe faculty renovated the theology department, laid the foundation for modern-day law, international law, modern economic science and actively participated in the Council of Trent. The school's mathematicians studied the calendar reform, commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII and proposed the solution that was later implemented. By 1580, 6,500 new students had arrived at Salamanca each year, amongst the graduates were state officials of the Spanish monarchy administration. It was also during this period when the first female university students were probably admitted, Beatriz Galindo and Luisa de Medrano, the latter probably being the first woman ever to give classes at a university.[13]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Sorcery[edit]\n\n\nIn popular belief, the university was associated with sorcery. A certain cave in Salamanca was considered the site of a school of black magic. In Spanish, Salamanca may mean \"cave\", \"an evil iguana\" and \"hand trick\"[14] and the *salamanquesa* (*Tarentola mauritanica*, the Spanish name is also derived from \"salamander\") is a reptile with magical attributes in Spanish tradition.[15]\nIn Romanian folklore, the devil runs a school of black magic named *Scholomance*.\n\n\nThe name is derived from \"Salamanca\" and the wise king \"Solomon\".[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Present day[edit]\n\n\nSalamanca draws undergraduate and graduate students from across Spain and the world; it is the top-ranked university in Spain based on the number of students coming from other regions.[18] It is also known for its Spanish courses for non-native speakers, which attract more than two thousand foreign students each year.[19]\n\n\nToday, the University of Salamanca is an important center for the study of humanities and is particularly noted for its language studies, as well as in laws and economics. Scientific research is carried out in the university and research centers associated with it, such as at the Centro de Investigación del Cáncer [Cancer Research Centre],[20] Instituto de Neurociencias de Castilla y León or INCyL [Institute of Neuroscience of Castile and León],[21] Centro de Láseres Pulsados Ultracortos Ultraintensos [Ultrashort Ultraintense Pulse Lasers Centre]. It is one of only two Hispanophone universities in the world that have a MoU with the United Nations to train language professionals for the organization.[22] In conjunction with the University of Cambridge, the University of Salamanca co-founded the Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE) in 1989.\n\n\nIn 2018, the institution celebrated its eighth centennial.[23]\n\n\n\n## Library[edit]\n\n\nThe library holds about 906,000 volumes.[24]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Notable staff[edit]\n\n\n* Juan de Galavís, professor of theology; later became Archbishop of Santo Domingo and Archbishop of Bogotá\n* Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola, professor of Philosophy of Law and Natural Law\n* Enrique Gil Robles, professor of Natural Law\n* Paul Nuñez Coronel (d.1534), professor of Hebrew\n* Miguel de Unamuno, writer\n* Beatriz Galindo, (d. 1534), professor of Latin and rhetoric\n* Luisa de Medrano (d. 1527) professor of Latin.

Emerging around 1150 as a corporation associated with the cathedral school of Notre Dame de Paris, it was considered the second-oldest university in Europe.[1]\n\n\nOfficially chartered in 1200 by King Philip II of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was later often nicknamed after its theological College of Sorbonne, founded by Robert de Sorbon and chartered by King Louis IX around 1257.[1]\n\n\nHighly reputed internationally for its academic performance in the humanities ever since the Middle Ages – notably in theology and philosophy – it introduced several academic standards and traditions that have endured ever since and spread internationally, such as doctoral degrees and student nations. Notable popes, royalty, scientists, and intellectuals were educated at the University of Paris. A few of the colleges of the time are still visible close to the Panthéon and Jardin du Luxembourg: Collège des Bernardins (18 rue de Poissy, 5th arr.), Hôtel de Cluny (6 Place Paul Painlevé, 5th arr.), Collège Sainte-Barbe (4 rue Valette, 5th arr.), Collège d'Harcourt (44 Boulevard Saint-Michel, 6th arr.), and Cordeliers (21 rue École de Médecine, 6th arr.).[2]\n\n\nIn 1793, during the French Revolution, the university was closed and, by Item 27 of the Revolutionary Convention, the college endowments and buildings were sold.[3] A new University of France replaced it in 1806 with four independent faculties: the Faculty of Humanities (French: *Faculté des Lettres*), the Faculty of Law (later including Economics), the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Theology (closed in 1885).\n\n\nIn 1970, following the civil unrest of May 1968, the university was divided into 13 autonomous universities.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nIn 1150, the future University of Paris was a student-teacher corporation operating as an annex of the Notre-Dame cathedral school. The earliest historical reference to it is found in Matthew Paris' reference to the studies of his own teacher (an abbot of St. Albans) and his acceptance into \"the fellowship of the elect Masters\" there in about 1170,[4] and it is known that Lotario dei Conti di Segni, the future Pope Innocent III, completed his studies there in 1182 at the age of 21.\n\n\nThe corporation was formally recognised as an \"*Universitas*\" in an edict by King Philippe-Auguste in 1200: in it, among other accommodations granted to future students, he allowed the corporation to operate under ecclesiastic law which would be governed by the elders of the Notre-Dame Cathedral school, and assured all those completing courses there that they would be granted a diploma.[5]\n\n\nThe university had four faculties: Arts, Medicine, Law, and Theology. The Faculty of Arts was the lowest in rank, but also the largest, as students had to graduate there in order to be admitted to one of the higher faculties. The students were divided into four *nationes* according to language or regional origin: France, Normandy, Picardy, and England. The last came to be known as the *Alemannian* (German) nation. Recruitment to each nation was wider than the names might imply: the English-German nation included students from Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.\n\n\nThe faculty and nation system of the University of Paris (along with that of the University of Bologna) became the model for all later medieval universities. Under the governance of the Church, students wore robes and shaved the tops of their heads in tonsure, to signify they were under the protection of the church. Students followed the rules and laws of the Church and were not subject to the king's laws or courts. This presented problems for the city of Paris, as students ran wild, and its official had to appeal to Church courts for justice. Students were often very young, entering the school at 13 or 14 years of age and staying for six to 12 years.\n\n\n\n### 12th century: Organisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)La Sorbonne\nThree schools were especially famous in Paris: the *palatine or palace school*, the *school of Notre-Dame*, and that of Sainte-Geneviève Abbey. The decline of royalty brought about the decline of the first. The other two were ancient but did not have much visibility in the early centuries. The glory of the palatine school doubtless eclipsed theirs, until it completely gave way to them. These two centres were much frequented and many of their masters were esteemed for their learning. The first renowned professor at the school of Ste-Geneviève was Hubold, who lived in the tenth century. Not content with the courses at Liège, he continued his studies at Paris, entered or allied himself with the chapter of Ste-Geneviève, and attracted many pupils via his teaching. Distinguished professors from the school of Notre-Dame in the eleventh century include Lambert, disciple of Fulbert of Chartres; Drogo of Paris; Manegold of Germany; and Anselm of Laon. These two schools attracted scholars from every country and produced many illustrious men, among whom were: St. Stanislaus of Szczepanów, Bishop of Kraków; Gebbard, Archbishop of Salzburg; St. Stephen, third Abbot of Cîteaux; Robert d'Arbrissel, founder of the Abbey of Fontevrault etc. Three other men who added prestige to the schools of Notre-Dame and Ste-Geneviève were William of Champeaux, Abélard, and Peter Lombard.\n\n\nHumanistic instruction comprised grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy (trivium and quadrivium). To the higher instruction belonged dogmatic and moral theology, whose source was the Scriptures and the Patristic Fathers. It was completed by the study of Canon law. The School of Saint-Victor arose to rival those of Notre-Dame and Ste-Geneviève. It was founded by William of Champeaux when he withdrew to the Abbey of Saint-Victor. Its most famous professors are Hugh of St. Victor and Richard of St. Victor.\n\n\nThe plan of studies expanded in the schools of Paris, as it did elsewhere. A Bolognese compendium of canon law called the *Decretum Gratiani* brought about a division of the theology department. Hitherto the discipline of the Church had not been separate from so-called theology; they were studied together under the same professor. But this vast collection necessitated a special course, which was undertaken first at Bologna, where Roman law was taught. In France, first Orléans and then Paris erected chairs of canon law. Before the end of the twelfth century, the Decretals of Gerard La Pucelle, Mathieu d'Angers, and Anselm (or Anselle) of Paris, were added to the Decretum Gratiani. However, civil law was not included at Paris. In the twelfth century, medicine began to be publicly taught at Paris: the first professor of medicine in Paris records is Hugo, *physicus excellens qui quadrivium docuit*.\n\n\nProfessors were required to have measurable knowledge and be appointed by the university. Applicants had to be assessed by examination; if successful, the examiner, who was the head of the school, and known as *scholasticus*, *capiscol*, and *chancellor,* appointed an individual to teach. This was called the licence or faculty to teach. The licence had to be granted freely. No one could teach without it; on the other hand, the examiner could not refuse to award it when the applicant deserved it.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe school of Saint-Victor, under the abbey, conferred the licence in its own right; the school of Notre-Dame depended on the diocese, that of Ste-Geneviève on the abbey or chapter. The diocese and the abbey or chapter, through their chancellor, gave professorial investiture in their respective territories where they had jurisdiction. Besides Notre-Dame, Ste-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, there were several schools on the \"Island\" and on the \"Mount\". \"Whoever\", says Crevier \"had the right to teach might open a school where he pleased, provided it was not in the vicinity of a principal school.\" Thus a certain Adam, who was of English origin, kept his \"near the Petit Pont\"; another Adam, Parisian by birth, \"taught at the Grand Pont which is called the Pont-au-Change\" (*Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris,* I, 272).\n\n\nThe number of students in the school of the capital grew constantly, so that lodgings were insufficient. French students included princes of the blood, sons of the nobility, and ranking gentry. The courses at Paris were considered so necessary as a completion of studies that many foreigners flocked to them. Popes Celestine II, Adrian IV and Innocent III studied at Paris, and Alexander III sent his nephews there. Noted German and English students included Otto of Freisingen, Cardinal Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, St. Thomas of Canterbury, and John of Salisbury; while Ste-Geneviève became practically the seminary for Denmark. The chroniclers of the time called Paris the city of letters par excellence, placing it above Athens, Alexandria, Rome, and other cities: \"At that time, there flourished at Paris philosophy and all branches of learning, and there the seven arts were studied and held in such esteem as they never were at Athens, Egypt, Rome, or elsewhere in the world.\" (\"Les gestes de Philippe-Auguste\"). Poets extolled the university in their verses, comparing it to all that was greatest, noblest, and most valuable in the world.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sorbonne covered by snow.\nTo allow poor students to study the first college des dix-Huit was founded by a knight returning from Jerusalem called Josse of London for 18 scholars who received lodgings and 12 pence or denarii a month.[6]\n\n\nAs the university developed, it became more institutionalized. First, the professors formed an association, for according to Matthew Paris, John of Celles, twenty-first Abbot of St Albans, England, was admitted as a member of the teaching corps of Paris after he had followed the courses (*Vita Joannis I, XXI, abbat. S. Alban*). The masters, as well as the students, were divided according to national origin,. Alban wrote that Henry II, King of England, in his difficulties with St. Thomas of Canterbury, wanted to submit his cause to a tribunal composed of professors of Paris, chosen from various provinces (Hist. major, Henry II, to end of 1169). This was likely the start of the division according to \"nations,\" which was later to play an important part in the university. Celestine III ruled that both professors and students had the privilege of being subject only to the ecclesiastical courts, not to civil courts.\n\n\nThe three schools: Notre-Dame, Sainte-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, may be regarded as the triple cradle of the *Universitas scholarium*, which included masters and students; hence the name *University*. Henry Denifle and some others hold that this honour is exclusive to the school of Notre-Dame (Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis), but the reasons do not seem convincing. He excludes Saint-Victor because, at the request of the abbot and the religious of Saint-Victor, Gregory IX in 1237 authorized them to resume the interrupted teaching of theology. But the university was largely founded about 1208, as is shown by a Bull of Innocent III. Consequently, the schools of Saint-Victor might well have contributed to its formation. Secondly, Denifle excludes the schools of Ste-Geneviève because there had been no interruption in the teaching of the liberal arts. This is debatable and through the period, theology was taught. The chancellor of Ste-Geneviève continued to give degrees in arts, something he would have ceased if his abbey had no part in the university organization.\n\n\n\n### 13th–14th century: Expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Meeting of doctors at the University of Paris. From a 16th-century miniature.\nIn 1200, King Philip II issued a diploma \"for the security of the scholars of Paris,\" which affirmed that students were subject only to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The provost and other officers were forbidden to arrest a student for any offence, unless to transfer him to ecclesiastical authority. The king's officers could not intervene with any member unless having a mandate from an ecclesiastical authority. His action followed a violent incident between students and officers outside the city walls at a pub.\n\n\nIn 1215, the Apostolic legate, Robert de Courçon, issued new rules governing who could become a professor. To teach the arts, a candidate had to be at least twenty-one, to have studied these arts at least six years, and to take an engagement as professor for at least two years. For a chair in theology, the candidate had to be thirty years of age, with eight years of theological studies, of which the last three years were devoted to special courses of lectures in preparation for the mastership. These studies had to be made in the local schools under the direction of a master. In Paris, one was regarded as a scholar only by studies with particular masters. Lastly, purity of morals was as important as reading. The licence was granted, according to custom, gratuitously, without oath or condition. Masters and students were permitted to unite, even by oath, in defence of their rights, when they could not otherwise obtain justice in serious matters. No mention is made either of law or of medicine, probably because these sciences were less prominent.\n\n\n\nMain article: University of Paris strike of 1229\n\nIn 1229, a denial of justice by the queen led to suspension of the courses. The pope intervened with a bull that began with lavish praise of the university: \"Paris\", said Gregory IX, \"mother of the sciences, is another Cariath-Sepher, city of letters\". He commissioned the Bishops of Le Mans and Senlis and the Archdeacon of Châlons to negotiate with the French Court for the restoration of the university, but by the end of 1230 they had accomplished nothing. Gregory IX then addressed a Bull of 1231 to the masters and scholars of Paris. Not only did he settle the dispute, he empowered the university to frame statutes concerning the discipline of the schools, the method of instruction, the defence of theses, the costume of the professors, and the obsequies of masters and students (expanding upon Robert de Courçon's statutes). Most importantly, the pope granted the university the right to suspend its courses, if justice were denied it, until it should receive full satisfaction.\n\n\nThe pope authorized Pierre Le Mangeur to collect a moderate fee for the conferring of the license of professorship. Also, for the first time, the scholars had to pay tuition fees for their education: two sous weekly, to be deposited in the common fund.\n\n\n\n#### Rector[edit]\n\n\nThe university was organized as follows: at the head of the teaching body was a rector. The office was elective and of short duration; at first it was limited to four or six weeks. Simon de Brion, legate of the Holy See in France, realizing that such frequent changes caused serious inconvenience, decided that the rectorate should last three months, and this rule was observed for three years. Then the term was lengthened to one, two, and sometimes three years. The right of election belonged to the procurators of the four nations. Henry of Unna was proctor of the University of Paris in the 14th century, beginning his term on January 13, 1340.\n\n\n\n#### Four \"nations\"[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map showing the territories covered by the four nations of the University of Paris during the Middle Ages.\nMain article: Nation (university)\n\nThe \"nations\" appeared in the second half of the twelfth century. They were mentioned in the Bull of Honorius III in 1222. Later, they formed a distinct body. By 1249, the four nations existed with their procurators, their rights (more or less well-defined), and their keen rivalries: the nations were the French, English, Normans, and Picards. After the Hundred Years' War, the English nation was replaced by the Germanic. The four nations constituted the faculty of arts or letters.\n\n\nThe territories covered by the four nations were:\n\n\n\n* French nation: all the Romance-speaking parts of Europe except those included within the Norman and Picard nations\n* English nation (renamed 'German nation' after the Hundred Years' War): the British Isles, the Germanic-speaking parts of continental Europe (except those included within the Picard nation), and the Slavic-speaking parts of Europe. The majority of students within that nation came from Germany and Scotland, and when it was renamed 'German nation' it was also sometimes called *natio Germanorum et Scotorum* (\"nation of the Germans and Scots\").[7][8]\n* Norman nation: the ecclesiastical province of Rouen, which corresponded approximately to the Duchy of Normandy. This was a Romance-speaking territory, but it was not included within the French nation.\n* Picard nation: the Romance-speaking bishoprics of Beauvais, Noyon, Amiens, Laon, and Arras; the bilingual (Romance and Germanic-speaking) bishoprics of Thérouanne, Cambrai, and Tournai; a large part of the bilingual bishopric of Liège; and the southernmost part of the Germanic-speaking bishopric of Utrecht (the part of that bishopric located south of the river Meuse; the rest of the bishopric north of the Meuse belonged to the English nation). It was estimated that about half of the students in the Picard nation were Romance-speakers (Picard and Walloon), and the other half were Germanic-speakers (West Flemish, East Flemish, Brabantian and Limburgish dialects).[9]\n\n\n#### Faculties[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Faculty of Law of Paris\n\nTo classify professors' knowledge, the schools of Paris gradually divided into faculties. Professors of the same science were brought into closer contact until the community of rights and interests cemented the union and made them distinct groups. The faculty of medicine seems to have been the last to form. But the four faculties were already formally established by 1254, when the university described in a letter \"theology, jurisprudence, medicine, and rational, natural, and moral philosophy\". The masters of theology often set the example for the other faculties—e.g., they were the first to adopt an official seal.\n\n\nThe faculties of theology, canon law, and medicine, were called \"superior faculties\". The title of \"Dean\" as designating the head of a faculty, came into use by 1268 in the faculties of law and medicine, and by 1296 in the faculty of theology. It seems that at first the deans were the oldest masters. The faculty of arts continued to have four procurators of its four nations and its head was the rector. As the faculties became more fully organized, the division into four nations partially disappeared for theology, law and medicine, though it continued in arts. Eventually the superior faculties included only doctors, leaving the bachelors to the faculty of arts. At this period, therefore, the university had two principal degrees, the baccalaureate and the doctorate. It was not until much later that the licentiate and the DEA became intermediate degrees.\n\n\n\n#### Colleges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rue Saint-Jacques and the Sorbonne in Paris\nThe scattered condition of the scholars in Paris often made lodging difficult. Some students rented rooms from townspeople, who often exacted high rates while the students demanded lower. This tension between scholars and citizens would have developed into a sort of civil war if Robert de Courçon had not found the remedy of taxation. It was upheld in the Bull of Gregory IX of 1231, but with an important modification: its exercise was to be shared with the citizens. The aim was to offer the students a shelter where they would fear neither annoyance from the owners nor the dangers of the world. Thus were founded the colleges (colligere, to assemble); meaning not centers of instruction, but simple student boarding-houses. Each had a special goal, being established for students of the same nationality or the same science. Often, masters lived in each college and oversaw its activities.\n\n\nFour colleges appeared in the 12th century; they became more numerous in the 13th, including Collège d'Harcourt (1280) and the Collège de Sorbonne (1257). Thus the University of Paris assumed its basic form. It was composed of seven groups, the four nations of the faculty of arts, and the three superior faculties of theology, law, and medicine. Men who had studied at Paris became an increasing presence in the high ranks of the Church hierarchy; eventually, students at the University of Paris saw it as a right that they would be eligible to benefices. Church officials such as St. Louis and Clement IV lavishly praised the university.\n\n\nBesides the famous Collège de Sorbonne, other *collegia* provided housing and meals to students, sometimes for those of the same geographical origin in a more restricted sense than that represented by the nations. There were 8 or 9 *collegia* for foreign students: the oldest one was the Danish college, the *Collegium danicum* or *dacicum*, founded in 1257. Swedish students could, during the 13th and 14th centuries, live in one of three Swedish colleges, the *Collegium Upsaliense*, the *Collegium Scarense* or the *Collegium Lincopense*, named after the Swedish dioceses of Uppsala, Skara and Linköping.\n\n\nThe *Collège de Navarre* was founded in 1305, originally aimed at students from Navarre, but due to its size, wealth, and the links between the crowns of France and Navarre, it quickly accepted students from other nations. The establishment of the College of Navarre was a turning point in the university's history: Navarra was the first college to offer teaching to its students, which at the time set it apart from all previous colleges, founded as charitable institutions that provided lodging, but no tuition. Navarre's model combining lodging and tuition would be reproduced by other colleges, both in Paris and other universities.\n[10]\n\n\nThe German College, *Collegium alemanicum* is mentioned as early as 1345, the Scots college or *Collegium scoticum* was founded in 1325. The Lombard college or *Collegium lombardicum* was founded in the 1330s. The *Collegium constantinopolitanum* was, according to a tradition, founded in the 13th century to facilitate a merging of the eastern and western churches. It was later reorganized as a French institution, the *Collège de la Marche-Winville*. The Collège de Montaigu was founded by the Archbishop of Rouen in the 14th century, and reformed in the 15th century by the humanist Jan Standonck, when it attracted reformers from within the Roman Catholic Church (such as Erasmus and Ignatius of Loyola) and those who subsequently became Protestants (John Calvin and John Knox).\n\n\nAt this time, the university also went the controversy of the condemnations of 1210–1277.\n\n\nThe Irish College in Paris originated in 1578 with students dispersed between Collège Montaigu, Collège de Boncourt, and the Collège de Navarre, in 1677 it was awarded possession of the Collège des Lombards. A new Irish College was built in 1769 in rue du Cheval Vert (now rue des Irlandais), which exists today as the Irish Chaplaincy and Cultural centre.\n\n\n\n### 15th–18th century: Influence in France and Europe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Old Sorbonne on fire in 1670.\n![](image)The Sorbonne, Paris, in a 17th-century engraving\nIn the fifteenth century, Guillaume d'Estouteville, a cardinal and Apostolic legate, reformed the university, correcting its perceived abuses and introducing various modifications. This reform was less an innovation than a recall to observance of the old rules, as was the reform of 1600, undertaken by the royal government with regard to the three higher faculties. Nonetheless, and as to the faculty of arts, the reform of 1600 introduced the study of Greek, of French poets and orators, and of additional classical figures like Hesiod, Plato, Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, and Sallust. The prohibition from teaching civil law was never well observed at Paris, but in 1679 Louis XIV officially authorized the teaching of civil law in the faculty of decretals. The \"faculty of law\" hence replaced the \"faculty of decretals\". The colleges meantime had multiplied; those of Cardinal Le-Moine and Navarre were founded in the fourteenth century. The Hundred Years' War was fatal to these establishments, but the university set about remedying the injury.\n\n\nBesides its teaching, the University of Paris played an important part in several disputes: in the Church, during the Great Schism; in the councils, in dealing with heresies and divisions; in the State, during national crises. Under the domination of England it played a role in the trial of Joan of Arc.\n\n\nProud of its rights and privileges, the University of Paris fought energetically to maintain them, hence the long struggle against the mendicant orders on academic as well as on religious grounds. Hence also the shorter conflict against the Jesuits, who claimed by word and action a share in its teaching. It made extensive use of its right to decide administratively according to occasion and necessity. In some instances it openly endorsed the censures of the faculty of theology and pronounced condemnation in its own name, as in the case of the Flagellants.\n\n\nIts patriotism was especially manifested on two occasions. During the captivity of King John, when Paris was given over to factions, the university sought to restore peace; and under Louis XIV, when the Spaniards crossed the Somme and threatened the capital, it placed two hundred men at the king's disposal and offered the Master of Arts degree gratuitously to scholars who should present certificates of service in the army (Jourdain, *Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris au XVIIe et XVIIIe siècle*, 132–34; *Archiv. du ministère de l'instruction publique*).\n\n\n\n### 1793: Abolition by the French Revolution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sorbonne as seen from *rue des Écoles*.\nThe ancient university disappeared with the ancien régime in the French Revolution. On 15 September 1793, petitioned by the Department of Paris and several departmental groups, the National Convention decided that independently of the primary schools, \n\n\n> \"there should be established in the Republic three progressive degrees of instruction; the first for the knowledge indispensable to artisans and workmen of all kinds; the second for further knowledge necessary to those intending to embrace the other professions of society; and the third for those branches of instruction the study of which is not within the reach of all men\".\n> \n> \n\n\nMeasures were to be taken immediately: \"For means of execution the department and the municipality of Paris are authorized to consult with the Committee of Public Instruction of the National Convention, in order that these establishments shall be put in action by 1 November next, and consequently colleges now in operation and the faculties of theology, medicine, arts, and law are suppressed throughout the Republic\". This was the death-sentence of the university. It was not to be restored after the Revolution had subsided, no more than those of the provinces.\n\n\n\n### 1806–1968: Re-establishment[edit]\n\n\nThe university was re-established by Napoleon on 1 May 1806. All the faculties were replaced by a single centre, the University of France. The decree of 17 March 1808 created five distinct faculties: Law, Medicine, Letters/Humanities, Sciences, and Theology; traditionally, Letters and Sciences had been grouped together into one faculty, that of \"Arts\". After a century, people recognized that the new system was less favourable to study. The defeat of 1870 at the hands of Prussia was partially blamed on the growth of the superiority of the German university system of the 19th century, and led to another serious reform of the French university. In the 1880s, the \"licence\" (bachelor) degree is divided into, for the Faculty of Letters: Letters, Philosophy, History, Modern Languages, with French, Latin and Greek being requirements for all of them; and for the Faculty of Science, into: Mathematics, Physical Sciences and Natural Sciences; the Faculty of Theology is abolished by the Republic. At this time, the building of the Sorbonne was fully renovated.[11]\n\n\n\n### May 1968–1970: Shutdown[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: May 68\n\nThe student revolts of the late 1960s were caused in part by the French government's failure to plan for a sudden explosion in the number of university students as a result of the postwar baby boom. The number of French university students skyrocketed from only 280,000 during the 1962–63 academic year to 500,000 in 1967–68, but at the start of the decade, there were only 16 public universities in the entire country. To accommodate this rapid growth, the government hastily developed bare-bones off-site faculties as annexes of existing universities (roughly equivalent to American satellite campuses). These faculties did not have university status of their own, and lacked academic traditions, amenities to support student life, or resident professors. One-third of all French university students ended up in these new faculties, and were ripe for radicalization as a result of being forced to pursue their studies in such shabby conditions.[12]\n\n\nIn 1966, after a student revolt in Paris, Christian Fouchet, minister of education, proposed \"the reorganisation of university studies into separate two- and four-year degrees, alongside the introduction of selective admission criteria\" as a response to overcrowding in lecture halls.[13] Dissatisfied with these educational reforms, students began protesting in November 1967, at the campus of the University of Paris in Nanterre;[14] indeed, according to James Marshall, these reforms were seen \"as the manifestations of the technocratic-capitalist state by some, and by others as attempts to destroy the liberal university\".[15] After student activists protested against the Vietnam War, the campus was closed by authorities on 22 March and again on 2 May 1968.[16] Agitation spread to the Sorbonne the next day, and many students were arrested in the following week.[17] Barricades were erected throughout the Latin Quarter, and a massive demonstration took place on 13 May, gathering students and workers on strike.[18] The number of workers on strike reached about nine million by 22 May.[14] As explained by Bill Readings:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> [President Charles de Gaulle] responded on May 24 by calling for a referendum, and [...] the revolutionaries, led by informal action committees, attacked and burned the Paris Stock Exchange in response. The Gaullist government then held talks with union leaders, who agreed to a package of wage-rises and increases in union rights. The strikers, however, simply refused the plan. With the French state tottering, de Gaulle fled France on May 29 for a French military base in Germany. He later returned and, with the assurance of military support, announced [general] elections [within] forty days. [...] Over the next two months, the strikes were broken (or broke up) while the election was won by the Gaullists with an increased majority.[19]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n### 1970: Division[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of universities and higher education institutions in the Paris region § History since the dissolution of the University of Paris (1970)\n\nFollowing the disruption, de Gaulle appointed Edgar Faure as minister of education; Faure was assigned to prepare a legislative proposal for reform of the French university system, with the help of academics.[20] Their proposal was adopted on 12 November 1968;[21] in accordance with the new law, the faculties of the University of Paris were to reorganize themselves.[22] This led to the division of the University of Paris into 13 universities.\n\n\nIn 2017, Paris 4 and Paris 6 universities merged to form the Sorbonne University.[23] In 2019, Paris 5 and Paris 7 universities merged to form the new Paris Cité University, leaving the number of successor universities at 11.[24]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Number\n | Previous name\n | Current name\n | Faculties/institutes before breakup\n | Current subjects\n | Students\n | Academy\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Paris I\n | University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne | Faculty of Law and Economics (35 out of 41 of the economics Professors joined, along with a few professors from law) and the Faculty of Humanities.

Emerging around 1150 as a corporation associated with the cathedral school of Notre Dame de Paris, it was considered the second-oldest university in Europe.[1]\n\n\nOfficially chartered in 1200 by King Philip II of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was later often nicknamed after its theological College of Sorbonne, founded by Robert de Sorbon and chartered by King Louis IX around 1257.[1]\n\n\nHighly reputed internationally for its academic performance in the humanities ever since the Middle Ages – notably in theology and philosophy – it introduced several academic standards and traditions that have endured ever since and spread internationally, such as doctoral degrees and student nations. Notable popes, royalty, scientists, and intellectuals were educated at the University of Paris. A few of the colleges of the time are still visible close to the Panthéon and Jardin du Luxembourg: Collège des Bernardins (18 rue de Poissy, 5th arr.), Hôtel de Cluny (6 Place Paul Painlevé, 5th arr.), Collège Sainte-Barbe (4 rue Valette, 5th arr.), Collège d'Harcourt (44 Boulevard Saint-Michel, 6th arr.), and Cordeliers (21 rue École de Médecine, 6th arr.).[2]\n\n\nIn 1793, during the French Revolution, the university was closed and, by Item 27 of the Revolutionary Convention, the college endowments and buildings were sold.[3] A new University of France replaced it in 1806 with four independent faculties: the Faculty of Humanities (French: *Faculté des Lettres*), the Faculty of Law (later including Economics), the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Theology (closed in 1885).\n\n\nIn 1970, following the civil unrest of May 1968, the university was divided into 13 autonomous universities.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nIn 1150, the future University of Paris was a student-teacher corporation operating as an annex of the Notre-Dame cathedral school. The earliest historical reference to it is found in Matthew Paris' reference to the studies of his own teacher (an abbot of St. Albans) and his acceptance into \"the fellowship of the elect Masters\" there in about 1170,[4] and it is known that Lotario dei Conti di Segni, the future Pope Innocent III, completed his studies there in 1182 at the age of 21.\n\n\nThe corporation was formally recognised as an \"*Universitas*\" in an edict by King Philippe-Auguste in 1200: in it, among other accommodations granted to future students, he allowed the corporation to operate under ecclesiastic law which would be governed by the elders of the Notre-Dame Cathedral school, and assured all those completing courses there that they would be granted a diploma.[5]\n\n\nThe university had four faculties: Arts, Medicine, Law, and Theology. The Faculty of Arts was the lowest in rank, but also the largest, as students had to graduate there in order to be admitted to one of the higher faculties. The students were divided into four *nationes* according to language or regional origin: France, Normandy, Picardy, and England. The last came to be known as the *Alemannian* (German) nation. Recruitment to each nation was wider than the names might imply: the English-German nation included students from Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.\n\n\nThe faculty and nation system of the University of Paris (along with that of the University of Bologna) became the model for all later medieval universities. Under the governance of the Church, students wore robes and shaved the tops of their heads in tonsure, to signify they were under the protection of the church. Students followed the rules and laws of the Church and were not subject to the king's laws or courts. This presented problems for the city of Paris, as students ran wild, and its official had to appeal to Church courts for justice. Students were often very young, entering the school at 13 or 14 years of age and staying for six to 12 years.\n\n\n\n### 12th century: Organisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)La Sorbonne\nThree schools were especially famous in Paris: the *palatine or palace school*, the *school of Notre-Dame*, and that of Sainte-Geneviève Abbey. The decline of royalty brought about the decline of the first. The other two were ancient but did not have much visibility in the early centuries. The glory of the palatine school doubtless eclipsed theirs, until it completely gave way to them. These two centres were much frequented and many of their masters were esteemed for their learning. The first renowned professor at the school of Ste-Geneviève was Hubold, who lived in the tenth century. Not content with the courses at Liège, he continued his studies at Paris, entered or allied himself with the chapter of Ste-Geneviève, and attracted many pupils via his teaching. Distinguished professors from the school of Notre-Dame in the eleventh century include Lambert, disciple of Fulbert of Chartres; Drogo of Paris; Manegold of Germany; and Anselm of Laon. These two schools attracted scholars from every country and produced many illustrious men, among whom were: St. Stanislaus of Szczepanów, Bishop of Kraków; Gebbard, Archbishop of Salzburg; St. Stephen, third Abbot of Cîteaux; Robert d'Arbrissel, founder of the Abbey of Fontevrault etc. Three other men who added prestige to the schools of Notre-Dame and Ste-Geneviève were William of Champeaux, Abélard, and Peter Lombard.\n\n\nHumanistic instruction comprised grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy (trivium and quadrivium). To the higher instruction belonged dogmatic and moral theology, whose source was the Scriptures and the Patristic Fathers. It was completed by the study of Canon law. The School of Saint-Victor arose to rival those of Notre-Dame and Ste-Geneviève. It was founded by William of Champeaux when he withdrew to the Abbey of Saint-Victor. Its most famous professors are Hugh of St. Victor and Richard of St. Victor.\n\n\nThe plan of studies expanded in the schools of Paris, as it did elsewhere. A Bolognese compendium of canon law called the *Decretum Gratiani* brought about a division of the theology department. Hitherto the discipline of the Church had not been separate from so-called theology; they were studied together under the same professor. But this vast collection necessitated a special course, which was undertaken first at Bologna, where Roman law was taught. In France, first Orléans and then Paris erected chairs of canon law. Before the end of the twelfth century, the Decretals of Gerard La Pucelle, Mathieu d'Angers, and Anselm (or Anselle) of Paris, were added to the Decretum Gratiani. However, civil law was not included at Paris. In the twelfth century, medicine began to be publicly taught at Paris: the first professor of medicine in Paris records is Hugo, *physicus excellens qui quadrivium docuit*.\n\n\nProfessors were required to have measurable knowledge and be appointed by the university. Applicants had to be assessed by examination; if successful, the examiner, who was the head of the school, and known as *scholasticus*, *capiscol*, and *chancellor,* appointed an individual to teach. This was called the licence or faculty to teach. The licence had to be granted freely. No one could teach without it; on the other hand, the examiner could not refuse to award it when the applicant deserved it.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe school of Saint-Victor, under the abbey, conferred the licence in its own right; the school of Notre-Dame depended on the diocese, that of Ste-Geneviève on the abbey or chapter. The diocese and the abbey or chapter, through their chancellor, gave professorial investiture in their respective territories where they had jurisdiction. Besides Notre-Dame, Ste-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, there were several schools on the \"Island\" and on the \"Mount\". \"Whoever\", says Crevier \"had the right to teach might open a school where he pleased, provided it was not in the vicinity of a principal school.\" Thus a certain Adam, who was of English origin, kept his \"near the Petit Pont\"; another Adam, Parisian by birth, \"taught at the Grand Pont which is called the Pont-au-Change\" (*Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris,* I, 272).\n\n\nThe number of students in the school of the capital grew constantly, so that lodgings were insufficient. French students included princes of the blood, sons of the nobility, and ranking gentry. The courses at Paris were considered so necessary as a completion of studies that many foreigners flocked to them. Popes Celestine II, Adrian IV and Innocent III studied at Paris, and Alexander III sent his nephews there. Noted German and English students included Otto of Freisingen, Cardinal Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, St. Thomas of Canterbury, and John of Salisbury; while Ste-Geneviève became practically the seminary for Denmark. The chroniclers of the time called Paris the city of letters par excellence, placing it above Athens, Alexandria, Rome, and other cities: \"At that time, there flourished at Paris philosophy and all branches of learning, and there the seven arts were studied and held in such esteem as they never were at Athens, Egypt, Rome, or elsewhere in the world.\" (\"Les gestes de Philippe-Auguste\"). Poets extolled the university in their verses, comparing it to all that was greatest, noblest, and most valuable in the world.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sorbonne covered by snow.\nTo allow poor students to study the first college des dix-Huit was founded by a knight returning from Jerusalem called Josse of London for 18 scholars who received lodgings and 12 pence or denarii a month.[6]\n\n\nAs the university developed, it became more institutionalized. First, the professors formed an association, for according to Matthew Paris, John of Celles, twenty-first Abbot of St Albans, England, was admitted as a member of the teaching corps of Paris after he had followed the courses (*Vita Joannis I, XXI, abbat. S. Alban*). The masters, as well as the students, were divided according to national origin,. Alban wrote that Henry II, King of England, in his difficulties with St. Thomas of Canterbury, wanted to submit his cause to a tribunal composed of professors of Paris, chosen from various provinces (Hist. major, Henry II, to end of 1169). This was likely the start of the division according to \"nations,\" which was later to play an important part in the university. Celestine III ruled that both professors and students had the privilege of being subject only to the ecclesiastical courts, not to civil courts.\n\n\nThe three schools: Notre-Dame, Sainte-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, may be regarded as the triple cradle of the *Universitas scholarium*, which included masters and students; hence the name *University*. Henry Denifle and some others hold that this honour is exclusive to the school of Notre-Dame (Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis), but the reasons do not seem convincing. He excludes Saint-Victor because, at the request of the abbot and the religious of Saint-Victor, Gregory IX in 1237 authorized them to resume the interrupted teaching of theology. But the university was largely founded about 1208, as is shown by a Bull of Innocent III. Consequently, the schools of Saint-Victor might well have contributed to its formation. Secondly, Denifle excludes the schools of Ste-Geneviève because there had been no interruption in the teaching of the liberal arts. This is debatable and through the period, theology was taught. The chancellor of Ste-Geneviève continued to give degrees in arts, something he would have ceased if his abbey had no part in the university organization.\n\n\n\n### 13th–14th century: Expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Meeting of doctors at the University of Paris. From a 16th-century miniature.\nIn 1200, King Philip II issued a diploma \"for the security of the scholars of Paris,\" which affirmed that students were subject only to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The provost and other officers were forbidden to arrest a student for any offence, unless to transfer him to ecclesiastical authority. The king's officers could not intervene with any member unless having a mandate from an ecclesiastical authority. His action followed a violent incident between students and officers outside the city walls at a pub.\n\n\nIn 1215, the Apostolic legate, Robert de Courçon, issued new rules governing who could become a professor. To teach the arts, a candidate had to be at least twenty-one, to have studied these arts at least six years, and to take an engagement as professor for at least two years. For a chair in theology, the candidate had to be thirty years of age, with eight years of theological studies, of which the last three years were devoted to special courses of lectures in preparation for the mastership. These studies had to be made in the local schools under the direction of a master. In Paris, one was regarded as a scholar only by studies with particular masters. Lastly, purity of morals was as important as reading. The licence was granted, according to custom, gratuitously, without oath or condition. Masters and students were permitted to unite, even by oath, in defence of their rights, when they could not otherwise obtain justice in serious matters. No mention is made either of law or of medicine, probably because these sciences were less prominent.\n\n\n\nMain article: University of Paris strike of 1229\n\nIn 1229, a denial of justice by the queen led to suspension of the courses. The pope intervened with a bull that began with lavish praise of the university: \"Paris\", said Gregory IX, \"mother of the sciences, is another Cariath-Sepher, city of letters\". He commissioned the Bishops of Le Mans and Senlis and the Archdeacon of Châlons to negotiate with the French Court for the restoration of the university, but by the end of 1230 they had accomplished nothing. Gregory IX then addressed a Bull of 1231 to the masters and scholars of Paris. Not only did he settle the dispute, he empowered the university to frame statutes concerning the discipline of the schools, the method of instruction, the defence of theses, the costume of the professors, and the obsequies of masters and students (expanding upon Robert de Courçon's statutes). Most importantly, the pope granted the university the right to suspend its courses, if justice were denied it, until it should receive full satisfaction.\n\n\nThe pope authorized Pierre Le Mangeur to collect a moderate fee for the conferring of the license of professorship. Also, for the first time, the scholars had to pay tuition fees for their education: two sous weekly, to be deposited in the common fund.\n\n\n\n#### Rector[edit]\n\n\nThe university was organized as follows: at the head of the teaching body was a rector. The office was elective and of short duration; at first it was limited to four or six weeks. Simon de Brion, legate of the Holy See in France, realizing that such frequent changes caused serious inconvenience, decided that the rectorate should last three months, and this rule was observed for three years. Then the term was lengthened to one, two, and sometimes three years. The right of election belonged to the procurators of the four nations. Henry of Unna was proctor of the University of Paris in the 14th century, beginning his term on January 13, 1340.\n\n\n\n#### Four \"nations\"[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map showing the territories covered by the four nations of the University of Paris during the Middle Ages.\nMain article: Nation (university)\n\nThe \"nations\" appeared in the second half of the twelfth century. They were mentioned in the Bull of Honorius III in 1222. Later, they formed a distinct body. By 1249, the four nations existed with their procurators, their rights (more or less well-defined), and their keen rivalries: the nations were the French, English, Normans, and Picards. After the Hundred Years' War, the English nation was replaced by the Germanic. The four nations constituted the faculty of arts or letters.\n\n\nThe territories covered by the four nations were:\n\n\n\n* French nation: all the Romance-speaking parts of Europe except those included within the Norman and Picard nations\n* English nation (renamed 'German nation' after the Hundred Years' War): the British Isles, the Germanic-speaking parts of continental Europe (except those included within the Picard nation), and the Slavic-speaking parts of Europe. The majority of students within that nation came from Germany and Scotland, and when it was renamed 'German nation' it was also sometimes called *natio Germanorum et Scotorum* (\"nation of the Germans and Scots\").[7][8]\n* Norman nation: the ecclesiastical province of Rouen, which corresponded approximately to the Duchy of Normandy. This was a Romance-speaking territory, but it was not included within the French nation.\n* Picard nation: the Romance-speaking bishoprics of Beauvais, Noyon, Amiens, Laon, and Arras; the bilingual (Romance and Germanic-speaking) bishoprics of Thérouanne, Cambrai, and Tournai; a large part of the bilingual bishopric of Liège; and the southernmost part of the Germanic-speaking bishopric of Utrecht (the part of that bishopric located south of the river Meuse; the rest of the bishopric north of the Meuse belonged to the English nation). It was estimated that about half of the students in the Picard nation were Romance-speakers (Picard and Walloon), and the other half were Germanic-speakers (West Flemish, East Flemish, Brabantian and Limburgish dialects).[9]\n\n\n#### Faculties[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Faculty of Law of Paris\n\nTo classify professors' knowledge, the schools of Paris gradually divided into faculties. Professors of the same science were brought into closer contact until the community of rights and interests cemented the union and made them distinct groups. The faculty of medicine seems to have been the last to form. But the four faculties were already formally established by 1254, when the university described in a letter \"theology, jurisprudence, medicine, and rational, natural, and moral philosophy\". The masters of theology often set the example for the other faculties—e.g., they were the first to adopt an official seal.\n\n\nThe faculties of theology, canon law, and medicine, were called \"superior faculties\". The title of \"Dean\" as designating the head of a faculty, came into use by 1268 in the faculties of law and medicine, and by 1296 in the faculty of theology. It seems that at first the deans were the oldest masters. The faculty of arts continued to have four procurators of its four nations and its head was the rector. As the faculties became more fully organized, the division into four nations partially disappeared for theology, law and medicine, though it continued in arts. Eventually the superior faculties included only doctors, leaving the bachelors to the faculty of arts. At this period, therefore, the university had two principal degrees, the baccalaureate and the doctorate. It was not until much later that the licentiate and the DEA became intermediate degrees.\n\n\n\n#### Colleges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rue Saint-Jacques and the Sorbonne in Paris\nThe scattered condition of the scholars in Paris often made lodging difficult. Some students rented rooms from townspeople, who often exacted high rates while the students demanded lower. This tension between scholars and citizens would have developed into a sort of civil war if Robert de Courçon had not found the remedy of taxation. It was upheld in the Bull of Gregory IX of 1231, but with an important modification: its exercise was to be shared with the citizens. The aim was to offer the students a shelter where they would fear neither annoyance from the owners nor the dangers of the world. Thus were founded the colleges (colligere, to assemble); meaning not centers of instruction, but simple student boarding-houses. Each had a special goal, being established for students of the same nationality or the same science. Often, masters lived in each college and oversaw its activities.\n\n\nFour colleges appeared in the 12th century; they became more numerous in the 13th, including Collège d'Harcourt (1280) and the Collège de Sorbonne (1257). Thus the University of Paris assumed its basic form. It was composed of seven groups, the four nations of the faculty of arts, and the three superior faculties of theology, law, and medicine. Men who had studied at Paris became an increasing presence in the high ranks of the Church hierarchy; eventually, students at the University of Paris saw it as a right that they would be eligible to benefices. Church officials such as St. Louis and Clement IV lavishly praised the university.\n\n\nBesides the famous Collège de Sorbonne, other *collegia* provided housing and meals to students, sometimes for those of the same geographical origin in a more restricted sense than that represented by the nations. There were 8 or 9 *collegia* for foreign students: the oldest one was the Danish college, the *Collegium danicum* or *dacicum*, founded in 1257. Swedish students could, during the 13th and 14th centuries, live in one of three Swedish colleges, the *Collegium Upsaliense*, the *Collegium Scarense* or the *Collegium Lincopense*, named after the Swedish dioceses of Uppsala, Skara and Linköping.\n\n\nThe *Collège de Navarre* was founded in 1305, originally aimed at students from Navarre, but due to its size, wealth, and the links between the crowns of France and Navarre, it quickly accepted students from other nations. The establishment of the College of Navarre was a turning point in the university's history: Navarra was the first college to offer teaching to its students, which at the time set it apart from all previous colleges, founded as charitable institutions that provided lodging, but no tuition. Navarre's model combining lodging and tuition would be reproduced by other colleges, both in Paris and other universities.\n[10]\n\n\nThe German College, *Collegium alemanicum* is mentioned as early as 1345, the Scots college or *Collegium scoticum* was founded in 1325. The Lombard college or *Collegium lombardicum* was founded in the 1330s. The *Collegium constantinopolitanum* was, according to a tradition, founded in the 13th century to facilitate a merging of the eastern and western churches. It was later reorganized as a French institution, the *Collège de la Marche-Winville*. The Collège de Montaigu was founded by the Archbishop of Rouen in the 14th century, and reformed in the 15th century by the humanist Jan Standonck, when it attracted reformers from within the Roman Catholic Church (such as Erasmus and Ignatius of Loyola) and those who subsequently became Protestants (John Calvin and John Knox).\n\n\nAt this time, the university also went the controversy of the condemnations of 1210–1277.\n\n\nThe Irish College in Paris originated in 1578 with students dispersed between Collège Montaigu, Collège de Boncourt, and the Collège de Navarre, in 1677 it was awarded possession of the Collège des Lombards. A new Irish College was built in 1769 in rue du Cheval Vert (now rue des Irlandais), which exists today as the Irish Chaplaincy and Cultural centre.\n\n\n\n### 15th–18th century: Influence in France and Europe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Old Sorbonne on fire in 1670.\n![](image)The Sorbonne, Paris, in a 17th-century engraving\nIn the fifteenth century, Guillaume d'Estouteville, a cardinal and Apostolic legate, reformed the university, correcting its perceived abuses and introducing various modifications. This reform was less an innovation than a recall to observance of the old rules, as was the reform of 1600, undertaken by the royal government with regard to the three higher faculties. Nonetheless, and as to the faculty of arts, the reform of 1600 introduced the study of Greek, of French poets and orators, and of additional classical figures like Hesiod, Plato, Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, and Sallust. The prohibition from teaching civil law was never well observed at Paris, but in 1679 Louis XIV officially authorized the teaching of civil law in the faculty of decretals. The \"faculty of law\" hence replaced the \"faculty of decretals\". The colleges meantime had multiplied; those of Cardinal Le-Moine and Navarre were founded in the fourteenth century. The Hundred Years' War was fatal to these establishments, but the university set about remedying the injury.\n\n\nBesides its teaching, the University of Paris played an important part in several disputes: in the Church, during the Great Schism; in the councils, in dealing with heresies and divisions; in the State, during national crises. Under the domination of England it played a role in the trial of Joan of Arc.\n\n\nProud of its rights and privileges, the University of Paris fought energetically to maintain them, hence the long struggle against the mendicant orders on academic as well as on religious grounds. Hence also the shorter conflict against the Jesuits, who claimed by word and action a share in its teaching. It made extensive use of its right to decide administratively according to occasion and necessity. In some instances it openly endorsed the censures of the faculty of theology and pronounced condemnation in its own name, as in the case of the Flagellants.\n\n\nIts patriotism was especially manifested on two occasions. During the captivity of King John, when Paris was given over to factions, the university sought to restore peace; and under Louis XIV, when the Spaniards crossed the Somme and threatened the capital, it placed two hundred men at the king's disposal and offered the Master of Arts degree gratuitously to scholars who should present certificates of service in the army (Jourdain, *Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris au XVIIe et XVIIIe siècle*, 132–34; *Archiv. du ministère de l'instruction publique*).\n\n\n\n### 1793: Abolition by the French Revolution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sorbonne as seen from *rue des Écoles*.\nThe ancient university disappeared with the ancien régime in the French Revolution. On 15 September 1793, petitioned by the Department of Paris and several departmental groups, the National Convention decided that independently of the primary schools, \n\n\n> \"there should be established in the Republic three progressive degrees of instruction; the first for the knowledge indispensable to artisans and workmen of all kinds; the second for further knowledge necessary to those intending to embrace the other professions of society; and the third for those branches of instruction the study of which is not within the reach of all men\".\n> \n> \n\n\nMeasures were to be taken immediately: \"For means of execution the department and the municipality of Paris are authorized to consult with the Committee of Public Instruction of the National Convention, in order that these establishments shall be put in action by 1 November next, and consequently colleges now in operation and the faculties of theology, medicine, arts, and law are suppressed throughout the Republic\". This was the death-sentence of the university. It was not to be restored after the Revolution had subsided, no more than those of the provinces.\n\n\n\n### 1806–1968: Re-establishment[edit]\n\n\nThe university was re-established by Napoleon on 1 May 1806. All the faculties were replaced by a single centre, the University of France. The decree of 17 March 1808 created five distinct faculties: Law, Medicine, Letters/Humanities, Sciences, and Theology; traditionally, Letters and Sciences had been grouped together into one faculty, that of \"Arts\". After a century, people recognized that the new system was less favourable to study. The defeat of 1870 at the hands of Prussia was partially blamed on the growth of the superiority of the German university system of the 19th century, and led to another serious reform of the French university. In the 1880s, the \"licence\" (bachelor) degree is divided into, for the Faculty of Letters: Letters, Philosophy, History, Modern Languages, with French, Latin and Greek being requirements for all of them; and for the Faculty of Science, into: Mathematics, Physical Sciences and Natural Sciences; the Faculty of Theology is abolished by the Republic. At this time, the building of the Sorbonne was fully renovated.[11]\n\n\n\n### May 1968–1970: Shutdown[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: May 68\n\nThe student revolts of the late 1960s were caused in part by the French government's failure to plan for a sudden explosion in the number of university students as a result of the postwar baby boom. The number of French university students skyrocketed from only 280,000 during the 1962–63 academic year to 500,000 in 1967–68, but at the start of the decade, there were only 16 public universities in the entire country. To accommodate this rapid growth, the government hastily developed bare-bones off-site faculties as annexes of existing universities (roughly equivalent to American satellite campuses). These faculties did not have university status of their own, and lacked academic traditions, amenities to support student life, or resident professors. One-third of all French university students ended up in these new faculties, and were ripe for radicalization as a result of being forced to pursue their studies in such shabby conditions.[12]\n\n\nIn 1966, after a student revolt in Paris, Christian Fouchet, minister of education, proposed \"the reorganisation of university studies into separate two- and four-year degrees, alongside the introduction of selective admission criteria\" as a response to overcrowding in lecture halls.[13] Dissatisfied with these educational reforms, students began protesting in November 1967, at the campus of the University of Paris in Nanterre;[14] indeed, according to James Marshall, these reforms were seen \"as the manifestations of the technocratic-capitalist state by some, and by others as attempts to destroy the liberal university\".[15] After student activists protested against the Vietnam War, the campus was closed by authorities on 22 March and again on 2 May 1968.[16] Agitation spread to the Sorbonne the next day, and many students were arrested in the following week.[17] Barricades were erected throughout the Latin Quarter, and a massive demonstration took place on 13 May, gathering students and workers on strike.[18] The number of workers on strike reached about nine million by 22 May.[14] As explained by Bill Readings:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> [President Charles de Gaulle] responded on May 24 by calling for a referendum, and [...] the revolutionaries, led by informal action committees, attacked and burned the Paris Stock Exchange in response. The Gaullist government then held talks with union leaders, who agreed to a package of wage-rises and increases in union rights. The strikers, however, simply refused the plan. With the French state tottering, de Gaulle fled France on May 29 for a French military base in Germany. He later returned and, with the assurance of military support, announced [general] elections [within] forty days. [...] Over the next two months, the strikes were broken (or broke up) while the election was won by the Gaullists with an increased majority.[19]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n### 1970: Division[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of universities and higher education institutions in the Paris region § History since the dissolution of the University of Paris (1970)\n\nFollowing the disruption, de Gaulle appointed Edgar Faure as minister of education; Faure was assigned to prepare a legislative proposal for reform of the French university system, with the help of academics.[20] Their proposal was adopted on 12 November 1968;[21] in accordance with the new law, the faculties of the University of Paris were to reorganize themselves.[22] This led to the division of the University of Paris into 13 universities.\n\n\nIn 2017, Paris 4 and Paris 6 universities merged to form the Sorbonne University.[23] In 2019, Paris 5 and Paris 7 universities merged to form the new Paris Cité University, leaving the number of successor universities at 11.[24]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Number\n | Previous name\n | Current name\n | Faculties/institutes before breakup\n | Current subjects\n | Students\n | Academy\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Paris I\n | University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne | Faculty of Law and Economics (35 out of 41 of the economics Professors joined, along with a few professors from law) and the Faculty of Humanities.
