A former mascot of the team, Cool-kun, who was a penguin, was Mar-kun's friend and rival. He was retired by the team in 2016.[4] |\n| Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks | Hawk Family\n | The SoftBank Hawks have the most mascots of any NPB team, with 11, 9 of which being part of the Hawk Family.

Frep was introduced in 2016, initially as an apprentice to Brisky, then became main in 2018.
