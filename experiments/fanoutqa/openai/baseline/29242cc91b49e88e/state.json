That changed in 2008 when Downey starred in two critically and commercially successful films, *Iron Man* and *Tropic Thunder*. In the article Ben Stiller wrote for Downey's entry in the 2008 edition of *The Time 100*, he offered an observation on Downey's commercially successful summer at the box office:\n\n\n\n\n> Yes, Downey is *Iron Man*, but he really is Actor Man\u00a0... In the realm where box office is irrelevant and talent is king, the realm that actually means something, he has always ruled, and finally this summer he gets to have his cake and let us eat him up all the way to the multiplex, where his mastery is in full effect. \n> \n> \u2014\u200aBen Stiller, The 2008 *Time 100*, entry No. 60, \"Robert Downey Jr.\"[76]\n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first role Downey accepted after *Iron Man* was Sherlock Holmes in Guy Ritchie's adaptation *Sherlock Holmes*. Warner Bros. released it on December 25, 2009.[97] The film set several box office records in the United States for a Christmas Day release, beating the previous record-holder, 2008's *Marley & Me*, by nearly $10M, and finished second to *Avatar* in a record-setting Christmas weekend box office. *Sherlock Holmes* ended up being the 8th highest-grossing film of 2009.[98][99] When Downey won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for his role as Sherlock Holmes, he noted in his acceptance speech that he had prepared no remarks because \"Susan Downey told me that Matt Damon was going to win so don't bother preparing a speech\".[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2007, Downey was cast as the title character in the film *Iron Man*,[77] with director Jon Favreau explaining the choice by stating: \"Downey wasn't the most obvious choice, but he understood what makes the character tick. He found a lot of his own life experience in 'Tony Stark'.\"[78] Favreau insisted on having Downey as he repeatedly claimed that Downey would be to *Iron Man* what Johnny Depp is to the *Pirates of the Caribbean* series: a lead actor who could both elevate the quality of the film and increase the public's interest in it.[43][79][80][81] For the role, Downey had to gain more than 20 pounds (9 kilograms) of muscle in five months to look like he \"had the power to forge iron\".[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n89. **^** Vary, Adam B.

In 2008, Downey was named by *Time* magazine among the 100 most influential people in the world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by *Forbes* as Hollywood's highest-paid actor.[2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDowney says he has been drug-free since July 2003[139] and credited his wife with helping him overcome his drug and alcohol habits, along with his family, therapy, meditation, twelve-step recovery programs, yoga, and the practice of Wing Chun kung fu,[25] the martial art he learned from Eric Oram, who is also a fight consultant in several of Downey's movies.[140][141] Oram was Downey's personal fight coordinator in *Avengers: Age of Ultron* and *Captain America: Civil War*.[142] In December 2015, Downey received a full and unconditional pardon from Governor of California Jerry Brown for his prior drug convictions.[143][144] Oram wrote a letter in support of Downey's pardon to Governor Brown.[145] When asked on *The Oprah Winfrey Show* how he was able to make his sobriety stick this time, Downey said: \"It's really not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems.

That same year he acted opposite Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise as a narcotics detective in Michael Mann's crime thriller *Collateral* (2004).[1] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* praised Ruffalo writing, \" [He] provides an extra dimension of intelligence to what initially looks like a stock cop role.\"[12] He starred in *Just Like Heaven* (2005) with Reese Witherspoon which was adapted from the French novel by Marc Levy entitled, *If Only It Were True*. That same year he acted in the Rob Reiner romantic comedy *Rumor Has It* (2005) starring Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Costner and Shirley MacLaine.[1]\n\n\nIn 2006 he starred in the political drama remake *All the King's Men* acting opposite Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Anthony Hopkins.

Ruffalo acted alongside Lauren Ambrose, Pablo Schreiber and Zoe Wanamaker. Charles Isherwood of *The New York Times* wrote of his performance, \"Nobody slings it with more panache than Mark Ruffalo, the soulful movie and stage actor making his Broadway debut here.\"[13] David Rooney of *Variety* wrote \"The most arresting work onstage comes from Ruffalo, channeling prickly charm into a proud man who uses glib aggression to camouflage his frustration. Ruffalo\u2019s scenes with Ambrose are the drama\u2019s most electric moments\".[14] The role earned him a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play nomination.[1]\n\n\nIn March 2007, he appeared in David Fincher's crime thriller *Zodiac* as SFPD homicide inspector Dave Toschi, who ran the investigation to find and apprehend the Zodiac killer from 1969 through most of the 1970s.[1] Ruffalo acted opposite Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr..

Toschi was role model for the Clint Eastwood film *Dirty Harry*.[15] That same year, Ruffalo played divorced lawyer Dwight Arno, who accidentally kills a child and speeds away, in Terry George's film *Reservation Road*, based on the novel by John Burnham Schwartz.[16] In 2008, Ruffalo starred as a con man in *The Brothers Bloom* with Adrien Brody and Rachel Weisz and co-starred with Julianne Moore in *Blindness*. 2008 also saw Ruffalo in Brian Goodman's *What Doesn't Kill You* with Ethan Hawke and Amanda Peet, which was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival.

Ruffalo stated in an interview that he approached Cholodenko after watching *High Art* and said he would love to work with her. Years later, she called Ruffalo and said she wrote a script and had him in mind for the part. Justin Lowe of *The Hollywood Reporter* praised all three leads for their chemistry and performances writing, \"Moore, Bening and Ruffalo all deliver endearingly quirky comic performances\".[22] His role earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ruffalo at the Toronto premiere of *The Avengers* in 2012\nRuffalo starred in *The Avengers* (2012), the sixth installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, replacing Edward Norton as Dr. Bruce Banner / Hulk.[24] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* praised Ruffalo's work writing, \"Ruffalo actually makes Bruce and Hulk interesting, even droll characters (he also plays the monster in mo-cap), superior to the Eric Bana and Edward Norton incarnations, and his version ingeniously locates the big green monster's secret not in the over-rehearsed subject of \"anger management\" but depression and self-hate.\"[25] He reprised the role again in *Iron Man 3* (2013),[26] and in *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015),[27]\n\n\n\nIn 2013 he starred in the romantic comedy *Begin Again* acting alongside Keira Knightley. The film received positive reviews and was a financial success. The following year, Ruffalo starred as Ned Weeks in the HBO television adaptation of Larry Kramer's AIDS-era play, *The Normal Heart* (2014), his performance earned him an Emmy nomination.[28] He says he has had an outpouring of support for his performance: \n\n\n> I've never had so sincere and vulnerable a response from people for anything that I've ever done. ... And of everything that I've done since I've been on social media, which hasn't been that long, by the way, I haven't had such an overwhelmingly positive response as I have from *The Normal Heart* directly to me. And it's a blessing, man. If this is it, if I have a piano dropped on me tomorrow, then I would go down thinking, \"You know what, I did okay as far as my career goes, because that's a gift. That's rare.\"[29]\n> \n> \n\n\nAlso in 2014, Ruffalo received his second Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of wrestler Dave Schultz in the biographical drama *Foxcatcher* directed by Bennett Miller. Ruffalo co-starred alongside Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, and Vanessa Redgrave. Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* wrote of their performances, \"Tatum and Ruffalo, as Mark and Dave, have outdone themselves. These actors give what seems to me the most compelling portrayal of brothers since Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro in Scorsese\u2019s *Raging Bull*.\"[30] The next year in 2015, he starred as a father of two with bipolar disorder in the independent comedy film *Infinitely Polar Bear*, for which he earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nomination.\n\n\nAlso in 2015 he portrayed journalist Michael Rezendes in the drama film *Spotlight*, for which he earned his third Academy Award nomination and a BAFTA Award nomination. Ruffalo acted opposite Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, and Liev Schreiber. Ruffalo told *The Hollywood Reporter* that he met with Rezendes and studied him as research for the film saying, \"I a lot of time with the real journalist, I had meals with him. I talked with him for hours. I sat next to him at work, I watched him work the phones. I watched him write his stories. I talked to him about his life and his family. I had him give me tours of Boston. As much as I could soak him up seemed to be the most important part.\".[31]\n\n\nThe following year he portrayed Agent Dylan Rhoades in *Now You See Me 2* (2016) and executive produced the romantic drama *Anything* (2017). He returned to Broadway in the revival of the Arthur Miller play *The Price* (2017) at the American Airlines Theatre. Ruffalo acted opposite Danny DeVito and Tony Shalhoub. Marilyn Stasio of *Variety* wrote, \"Ruffalo and DeVito clearly get a kick out of the buying and selling rituals of Victor and Solomon. There is warmth in their tones and mutual respect in their exchange of confidences\".[32]\n\n\nIn 2019 he starred as Robert Bilott in the Todd Haynes directed legal thriller *Dark Waters* which he also produced. The film co-starred Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Pullman, and Victor Garber. During this time he reprised his role of Bruce Banner in *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017),[33] *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018),[34][35] *Captain Marvel* (2019),[36] and *Avengers: Endgame* (2019).[37] He has been noted for spoiling the endings of *Avengers: Infinity War* a year ahead of theatrical release,[34][35] as well as *Avengers: Endgame* a few weeks ahead of release.[37]\n\n\n\n### 2020\u2013present[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020 Ruffalo portrayed dual roles of Dominick Birdsey / Thomas Birdsey in the HBO limited series *I Know This Much Is True* where he also served as an executive producer. Daniel D'Addario of *Variety* wrote, \"Ruffalo\u2019s performances carry the series. This is his two-man show, with supporting characters glimmering in and out\".[38] For his role he earned the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie. Ruffalo has continued to appear as Bruce Banner / The Hulk in *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* (2020)[39] and in the Disney+ series *She-Hulk: Attorney at Law* (2022).[40] In 2022 he acted in the Netflix science fiction action comedy *The Adam Project* opposite Ryan Reynolds, Jennifer Garner, and Zoe Saldana.\n\n\nIn 2023 he starred in the Yorgos Lanthimos directed black comedy fantasy film *Poor Things* starring Emma Stone and Willem Dafoe. The film premiered at the Venice International Film Festival where it received the Golden Lion. Maureen Lee Lenker of *Entertainment Weekly* wrote, \"Ruffalo appears to be having the time of his life, chewing the scenery with a manic glee. He's built a career playing solid, decent men, and what fun it is to watch him play a reprobate cad [and] a puffed-up vainglorious peacock, a man whose ego is the size of an entire continent\".[41] the same year, he played Daniel LeBlanc in the Netflix miniseries *All the Light We Cannot See* (2023). The series is based on Anthony Doerr's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name[42] and was released November 2, 2023.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Upcoming projects[edit]\n\n\nIn 2024 he is set to portray Hieronymous Marshall in the Bong Joon-ho directed science fiction film *Mickey 17*.

They have three children.[45][46]\n\n\nAfter completing work on the film *The Last Castle*, Ruffalo was diagnosed with a vestibular schwannoma, a type of brain tumor also known as an acoustic neuroma. The tumor was found to be benign; however, the surgery to remove the mass resulted in partial facial paralysis and affected his hearing.[47] The paralysis subsided after a year, but Ruffalo remains deaf in his left ear.[48]\n\n\nOn December 1, 2008, Ruffalo's younger brother, Scott, was found outside his home on North Palm Drive in Beverly Hills with an execution-style bullet wound to the head.[49][50] Scott was taken to a hospital, but died the following week.[51] The case remained unsolved as of 2013.[52]\n\n\nRuffalo and his family live in Sullivan County, New York, describing the Catskill Mountains as his \"home\". Ruffalo also owns two apartments in New York City, one for business and another for investment.[53] Ruffalo's mother and stepfather live in Boothbay Harbor, Maine, where he and his family occasionally spend their summers.[54]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Ruffalo was sued by residents of Ellenville, New York for not cleaning up a fire that broke out on the set of a car dealership that was used as a location for *I Know This Much Is True*.[55] The lawsuit claims that the residents suffered physical and emotional injuries and added that the fire caused damage to their homes and exposed them to toxic fumes.[56]\n\n\n\n## Activism and political views[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ruffalo with Medal of Honor recipient Retired U.S. Marine Corps Cpl. Kyle Carpenter in 2014\nRuffalo was interviewed by \"We Are Change\" at an anti-war rally in 2007.[57] Ruffalo expressed views in line with the 9/11 truth movement when he stated: \"I'm baffled by the way all three buildings came down. My first reaction was that buildings don't fall down like that.\"[58] In 2008, Ruffalo expressed concern that gas companies were eyeing his family's land in Callicoon, New York. After doing his own investigation, *New York* magazine wrote, he became \"anti-fracking's first famous face\".[59] On October 4, 2010, Ruffalo appeared on *The Rachel Maddow Show* to discuss hydraulic fracturing and the FRAC Act of 2009.[60] He claimed in the December 2010 issue of *GQ* that after he organized screenings in Pennsylvania of a documentary about natural-gas-drilling called *Gasland*, he was placed on a terror advisory list.[61] The Pennsylvania Governor's Office of Homeland Security denied the claim.[62]\n\n\nRuffalo is pro-choice. He has explained his opinion by saying: \"I don't want to turn back the hands of time to when women shuttled across state lines in the thick of night to resolve an unwanted pregnancy, in a cheap hotel room.\"[63] Ruffalo has called for an economic revolution, saying that \"capitalism today is failing us, killing us, and robbing from our children's future.\"[64]\n\n\nHe has shown support for the LGBT community;[65] however, he has received backlash from the transgender community for supporting the casting of Matt Bomer, a cisgender man, to play a trans woman in the film *Anything*, on which Ruffalo was an executive producer.[66]\n\n\nIn 2015, Ruffalo supported \"Education Is Not a Crime\" campaign alongside other artists and intellectuals including Nazanin Boniadi, Abbas Milani, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Azar Nafisi, Omid Djalili, Eva LaRue, Mohammad Maleki (former president of the University of Tehran), and Nobel Peace laureates such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Shirin Ebadi, Tawakkol Karman, Jody Williams, and Mairead Maguire, to draw attention to the Iranian government's systematic denial of university education to young Baha'is.[67]\n\n\nIn the 2016 election, Ruffalo supported Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders.[68] While on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*, Ruffalo endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for president in 2020 United States presidential election, stating \"you know when he gets in the office, he is going to be fighting for us\".[69] In February 2016, Ruffalo tweeted a *Tech Times* article in which a group of Argentinian doctors attributed the cause of a microcephaly outbreak in Brazil to the use of a larvicide chemical added to reservoirs of drinking water to combat dengue fever, rather than the Zika virus.[70] *The New York Times* described the claim as \"dubious\" and stated that those \"sounding the alarm\", did not mention that the larvicide did not work through the central nervous system and that it has been approved by the World Health Organization.[70] In March 2016, Ruffalo narrated and produced *Dear President Obama: The Clean Energy Revolution Is Now*, a documentary by director Jon Bowermaster which looks at President Barack Obama's environmental tenure and legacy concerning the massive expansion of oil and natural gas drilling.[71]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Ruffalo posted a petition on Twitter urging NBC to stop hiring white conservative commentators.[72] The same month, Ruffalo endorsed Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election. He tweeted: \"Because @jeremycorbyn offers people an alternative to the Corporate status quo, which never ends well for them, I humbly endorse Corbyn.\"[73][74] In October, Ruffalo actively supported the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in their opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline project.[75] Ruffalo signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as \"a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world\" and endorsed him for in the 2019 UK general election.[76] In October 2019, Ruffalo tweeted that \"until George W. Bush is brought to justice for the crimes of the Iraq War, (including American-led torture, Iraqi deaths & displacement, and the deep scars\u2014emotional & otherwise\u2014inflicted on our military that served his folly), we can't even begin to talk about kindness.\"[77]\n\n\nAlso in 2019, Ruffalo starred in and co-produced *Dark Waters*, which spotlighted another one of his environmental concerns with its true-life depiction of a corporate lawyer's relentless pursuit of justice to expose poisonous pollution by chemical behemoth DuPont. In June 2020, Ruffalo appeared in a webinar conference for the Irish Green Party to encourage members to accept the recently negotiated programme for government, agreed between the party, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il.[78] In October 2020, speaking to Mehdi Hasan, Ruffalo condemned what he called Israel's \"asymmetrical warfare\" against the Palestinians, stating, \"There is no reason that an ally of America should not be held to the same standards as any other nation in the world.\" Ruffalo also related that he had been called an antisemite for his views, saying, \"[It's] really tough to hear. And the fact that so many people will take it to that extreme, when you're talking about that kind of inequality, that kind of oppression, that kind of apartheid.\"[79] In 2021, he said it was \"inflammatory\" and \"disrespectful\" to suggest Israel is committing genocide.[80]\n\n\nIn November 2021, Ruffalo criticized the not guilty ruling in the case of Kyle Rittenhouse in his hometown of Kenosha, Wisconsin and said the people shot by Rittenhouse were murdered.[81][82][83] In April 2022, Ruffalo urged voters to check voter ID requirements in their states through posts to his social media. Ruffalo cited VoteRiders as a source of assistance for voter ID requirements across the United States.[84][85] In 2023, Ruffalo sought to block the sale of the West Park Presbyterian Church, which was built in the 1880s and has been designated a city landmark. The congregation said it could not afford the cost of maintaining the deteriorating church building and wanted to use the proceeds of the sale for charity work. Ruffalo said the church building should be saved. He lives in the church neighborhood and has started a campaign to raise money for the building.[86]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Ruffalo criticized the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, for describing the civilian deaths during the Israeli attacks on Gaza as 'collateral damage.'[87]\n\n\n\n## Acting credits and awards[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mark Ruffalo on screen and stage and List of awards and nominations received by Mark Ruffalo\n\nRuffalo has had a range of credits on screen and stage, including several performances of varying genres\u2014mostly as a supporting actor.

He rose to prominence playing Kim Hyde in the Australian television series *Home and Away* (2004\u20132007) before beginning a film career in Hollywood. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Hemsworth started playing Thor with the 2011 film of the same name and most recently reprised the role in *Thor: Love and Thunder* (2022), which established him among the world's highest-paid actors.[1][2]\n\n\nHis other film roles include the action films *Star Trek* (2009), *Snow White and the Huntsman* (2012) and its sequel *The Huntsman: Winter's War* (2016), *Red Dawn* (2012), *Blackhat* (2015), *Men in Black: International* (2019), *Extraction* (2020), the thriller *A Perfect Getaway* (2009) and the comedy *Ghostbusters* (2016). Hemsworth's most critically acclaimed films include the comedy horror *The Cabin in the Woods* (2012) and the biographical sports film *Rush* (2013) in which he portrayed James Hunt.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nChristopher Hemsworth[3] was born on 11 August 1983[4] in Melbourne,[5] to Leonie (n\u00e9e van Os),[6] an English teacher, and Craig Hemsworth, a social-services counsellor.[7][8] He is the second of three sons, following Luke (b. 1980) and preceding Liam (b. 1990); both of them are also actors. His maternal grandfather is a Dutch immigrant and his maternal grandmother is of Irish descent;[9][*non-primary source needed*] on his paternal line he is of English, Scottish, and German ancestry.[6] He was brought up both in Melbourne and in the Outback in Bulman, Northern Territory. He has said, \"My earliest memories were on the cattle stations up in the Outback, and then we moved back to Melbourne and then back out there and then back again. Certainly most of my childhood was in Melbourne but probably my most vivid memories were up there [in Bulman] with crocodiles and buffalo. Very different walks of life.\"[5] He attended high school at Heathmont College[5] before his family again returned to the Northern Territory, and then moved a few years later to Phillip Island.[10]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early work (2002\u20132010)[edit]\n\n\nHemsworth started his career by appearing in several television series. In 2002, Hemsworth starred in two episodes of fantasy television series *Guinevere Jones* as King Arthur, as well as making an appearance in soap opera series *Neighbours* and one episode of *Marshall Law*. The following year, he appeared in an episode of *The Saddle Club*. In 2004, Hemsworth auditioned for the role of Robbie Hunter in Australian soap opera *Home and Away*. He did not receive the part, but was subsequently recalled for the part of Kim Hyde. He moved to Sydney to join the cast, appearing in 171 episodes of the series.[11] He left the cast of *Home and Away* on 3 July 2007. Hemsworth later remarked that although he became more visible after *Home and Away*, his work on a soap opera did not earn him respect within the film industry.[12]\n\n\nHemsworth was a contestant on the fifth season of *Dancing with the Stars Australia*, partnered with professional dancer Abbey Ross. The season premiered on 26 September 2006, and after six weeks, Hemsworth was eliminated on 7 November. Hemsworth's appearance in the franchise almost cost him the role of Thor, as producers of the Marvel film franchise feared fans would be put off.[13]\n\n\nIn 2009, Hemsworth played James T. Kirk's father, George Kirk, in the opening scenes of J. J. Abrams' film *Star Trek*. The role was initially offered to Matt Damon, who turned it down; Abrams appreciated Hemsworth taking on the role.[14] Josh Tyler of *CinemaBlend* was impressed with Hemsworth, describing the actor's scene as the \"best five minutes I've spent in a movie theater this year.\"[15] The film was a box office success, grossing US$385.7\u00a0million.[16] That same year, Hemsworth played the character Kale Garrity in the thriller *A Perfect Getaway*. It was a modest success, grossing US$22\u00a0million against a US$14\u00a0million budget,[17] and received mixed reviews,[18][19] but Hemsworth was praised for his \"appropriately intimidating\" performance of a \"thuggish backpacker.\"[20] Paul Young of *Screen Rant* also praised Hemsworth's performance as \"solid.\"[21]\n\n\nHemsworth went on to play Sam in 2010's *Ca$h* alongside English actor Sean Bean, which was the first film he shot when he arrived in the United States. The film's director, Stephen Milburn Anderson, said Hemsworth had only been in the United States for six weeks when he had auditioned for the role, recalling, \"Here's a guy who is young, has the right look, is a very good actor and, let's face it, he's beautiful. So I say, we need to get this guy in. I was very impressed\".[22] In November 2010, *The Hollywood Reporter* named Hemsworth one of the young male actors who are \"pushing\u00a0\u2013 or being pushed\" onto the Hollywood \"A-List\".[23]\n\n\n\n### Thor and worldwide recognition (2011\u20132015)[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Sony Pictures announced that Hemsworth would star in the thriller *Shadow Runner*,[24] but the film has yet to go into production. That same year, Hemsworth was cast as the superhero Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. His first film in the franchise was 2011's *Thor*. He and castmate Tom Hiddleston, who ultimately played Loki, had each auditioned for the role, for which Hemsworth said he gained 20 pounds of muscle.[25] With a worldwide gross of US$449.3\u00a0million,[26] *Thor* was the 15th highest-grossing film of 2011.[27] The film received positive reviews,[28] and Hemsworth's portrayal of the God of Thunder was praised by Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times*.[29] Hemsworth reprised the role the following year for the film *The Avengers* (2012) as one of the six superheroes\u2014alongside Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark / Iron Man, Chris Evans' Steve Rogers / Captain America, Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner / Hulk, Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanova / Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton / Hawkeye\u2014sent to defend Earth from his adopted brother, Loki.[30] The film was a critical[31] and commercial success, grossing over US$1.5\u00a0billion worldwide.[32] The ensemble cast was praised for their onscreen chemistry by Peter Travers of *Rolling Stone*.[33]\n\n\nHemsworth shot the horror film *The Cabin in the Woods* shortly after the release of *Star Trek*, but it went unreleased until 2012. It garnered positive reviews,[34] and his portrayal of Alpha male jock Curt Vaughan was described by Alison Foreman of Mashable as his \"sexiest\" role yet.[35] Hemsworth later starred opposite Kristen Stewart in the film *Snow White and the Huntsman* (2012) as the Huntsman. Although a commercial success, grossing US$396\u00a0million worldwide,[36] it received mixed reviews.[37] Critics were critical of Hemsworth and Stewart's onscreen chemistry, and Angela Watercutter of *Wired* felt the characters were \"not fully fleshed-out.\"[38] Hemsworth was cast as Jed Eckert in the 2012 *Red Dawn* remake after MGM saw dailies footage of a scene from *The Cabin in the Woods;*[39] he was cast as Thor two days after being cast in *Red Dawn*.[39] The film was a box-office bomb, grossing only US$50\u00a0million against a production budget of US$65\u00a0million,[40] and received negative reviews.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hemsworth in 2013\nIn 2013, Hemsworth starred in Ron Howard's sports drama film *Rush*, as 1976 Formula 1 World Champion James Hunt.[42] The film was critically praised and became a box office success, grossing US$98.2\u00a0million against a budget of US$38\u00a0million.[43] Henry Barnes of *The Guardian* was impressed with Hemsworth's performance, praising the actor for delivering the \"superb script\" with \"some mastery.\"[44] Later that year, Hemsworth reprised the role of Thor for the sequel to *Thor* in *Thor: The Dark World* (2013).[45] Although a commercial success with a worldwide gross of US$644.6\u00a0million,[46] the film became the lowest-rated film in the MCU franchise on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes at 66% approval rating.[47] The chemistry between Hemsworth and Hiddleston was praised by critics; Ben Child of *The Guardian* wrote, \"Thanks to Hiddleston and Hemsworth's impressive collective charisma, *Thor: The Dark World* is far from a franchise killer.\"[48]\n\n\nIn 2015, Hemsworth starred in director Michael Mann's action thriller *Blackhat*, opposite Viola Davis.[49] The film bombed at the box office[50] and was poorly received.[51] For many critics, a significant issue of the film was the casting of Hemsworth as a hacker;[52] Christy Lemire of the *Chicago Sun-Times* remarked, \"Anyone who makes [their] way in the world sitting in front of a computer screen all day is not going to look as hunky as Hemsworth.\"[53] Hemsworth himself later admitted to being displeased with his performance: \"I didn't enjoy what I did in the film,\" he commented. \"It just felt flat, and it was also an attempt to do what I thought people might have wanted to see. But I don't think I'm good in that space.\"[54] He reprised his role as Thor for the fourth time in the sequel to *The Avengers*, *Avengers: Age of Ultron*.[55] In addition to the film receiving positive reviews[56] and grossing over US$1.4\u00a0billion worldwide,[57] Hemsworth also won the People's Choice Awards for Favorite Action Movie Actor.[58] Hemsworth returned to the set of *Home and Away* in November 2014 to film a scene as an extra and not as his character Kim Hyde.[59][60] The episode which he appeared in was broadcast on 19 May 2015.[60]\n\n\nThat same year, he co-starred in the comedy film *Vacation*, along with Ed Helms, a revival of the film series that originally starred Chevy Chase.[61] He was nominated for the MTV Movie Awards for Best Kiss with Leslie Mann.[62] His last 2015 film was *In the Heart of the Sea*, based on the book of the same name by Nathaniel Philbrick, with Hemsworth playing first mate Owen Chase. In an interview on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!*, he said that to prepare for the role of starving sailors, the cast was put on a diet of 500\u2013600 calories a day to lose weight.[63] *In the Heart of the Sea* received mixed reviews from critics, and was a box office disappointment, grossing US$93\u00a0million against a US$100\u00a0million budget,[64] but Hemsworth received a nomination for Choice Movie Actor: Action at the 18th Teen Choice Awards.[65]\n\n\n\n### Continued commercial success (2016\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Hemsworth reprised the role of Eric the Huntsman in *The Huntsman: Winter's War*, alongside Jessica Chastain, who played his love interest. Writing for IndieWire, Oliver Lyttelton criticised the onscreen chemistry between Hemsworth and Chastain, stating that \"they're both struggling uphill against accents they're palpably not comfortable with, displaying zero chemistry, and frankly appearing to be in different films.\"[66] The film underperformed compared to its predecessor, grossing only US$165\u00a0million.[67] Hemsworth later joined the cast of the reboot *Ghostbusters* film, playing Kevin the receptionist.[68][69] The film disappointed critically and commercially, but Hemsworth was praised for \"deliver[ing] the most fun\" by Caroline Westbrook of *Metro*[70] and won the Kids' Choice Awards for Favorite Movie Actor.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hemsworth promoting *Thor: Ragnarok* at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con\nHemsworth reprised his role as Thor in *Thor: Ragnarok*, released on 3 November 2017 in the U.S.,[72] and again in both the third and fourth *Avengers* films, *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame* in 2018 and 2019 respectively.[73] All three films were a critical and commercial success.[74] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com likened Hemsworth's acting to Cary Grant, stating that \"Hemsworth's charisma holds [*Thor: Ragnarok*] together whenever it threatens to spin apart\".[75] Hemsworth won the Teen Choice Awards for Choice Sci-Fi Movie Actor.[76] Meanwhile, in his review of *Avengers: Endgame*, Joe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* acknowledged \"Hemsworth's Thor, endearing despite some ragged material and the actor's seemingly limited dramatic range\" while praising Hemsworth in the MCU Infinity Saga finale \"as the graceful, exuberant comic actor he was destined to be, while Thor morphs, alarmingly and charmingly\u2014yet still heroically\u2014into a beer-bellied apparition who could pass for Jeff Lebowski.\"[77] In 2017, Hemsworth was the guest narrator at Disney's Candlelight Processional at Disneyland.[78]\n\n\nIn 2019, Hemsworth also starred in a spin-off of the *Men in Black* series, titled *Men in Black: International*.[79] The film grossed US$253\u00a0million worldwide and received generally unfavourable reviews from critics, who criticised the \"lackluster action and forgettable plot,\" although the chemistry between Hemsworth and co-star Tessa Thompson was praised.[80] The following year, he starred in the Netflix action thriller *Extraction*, reuniting him with the Russo brothers, who served as producers.[81] After being watched by 90\u00a0million households in its initial month of release, the film broke Netflix's viewership record previously held by *Bird Box*.[82][83] In 2020, Hemsworth reprised the role of Thor in the fourth film, *Thor: Love and Thunder*. Filming began in February 2021 in Australia,[84][85] and it was released on June 23, 2022.[86]\n\n\nHemsworth has also been working on *Limitless*, a six-part documentary series, for National Geographic.

Johansson and Evans wrote their own dialogue for several scenes they had together.[144] Johansson was attracted to her character's way of doing her job, employing her feminine wiles and not her physical appeal.[145] The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $714\u00a0million worldwide.[146] Critic Odie Henderson saw \"a genuine emotional shorthand at work, especially from Johansson, who is excellent here\".[147] The role earned her a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination.[148]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n175. **^** Vary, Adam B.

She dropped out of the project following backlash to the casting of a cisgender woman to play a transgender man.[170]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJohansson played a supporting role in the film *Chef* (2014), alongside Robert Downey, Jr., Sof\u00eda Vergara, and director Jon Favreau. It grossed over $45\u00a0million at the box office and was well received by critics. The *Chicago Sun-Times* writer Richard Roeper found the film \"funny, quirky and insightful, with a bounty of interesting supporting characters\".[149] In Luc Besson's science fiction action film *Lucy* (2014), Johansson starred as the title character, who gains psychokinetic abilities when a nootropic drug is absorbed into her bloodstream.[150] Besson discussed the role with several actresses, and cast Johansson based on her strong reaction to the script and her discipline.[151] Critics generally praised the film's themes, visuals, and Johansson's performance; some found the plot nonsensical.[152] IGN's Jim Vejvoda attributed the film's success to her acting and Besson's style.[153] The film grossed $458\u00a0million on a budget of $40\u00a0million to become the 18th highest-grossing film of 2014.[154]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n129. **^** Buchanan, Kyle (June 21, 2013). \"Exclusive: Scarlett Johansson Replaced Samantha Morton in Spike Jonze's New Film, Her\". *New York*.

After initial reservations about playing a teenage character, Johansson was convinced by a friend to take on the part.[98] Ben Brantley of *The New York Times* wrote Johansson \"melts into her character so thoroughly that her nimbus of celebrity disappears\".[99] *Variety*'s David Rooney was impressed with the play and Johansson in particular, describing her as the chief performer.[100] She won the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play.[101] Some critics and Broadway actors criticized the award committee's decision to reward the work of mainstream Hollywood actors, including Johansson. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Johansson and Wes Anderson at the premiere of *Asteroid City* at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n235. **^** Sachdeva, Maanya (September 16, 2021). \"Britney Spears, Scarlett Johansson and Jason Sudeikis among Time 100 most influential\". *The Independent*.

Over the next few years, Renner had guest roles in *Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane* (1999), *The Net* (1999), *The Time of Your Life* (1999), and *Angel* (2000).[13] In 2001 Renner had a small role in an episode of *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation*.

He found the non-fiction role a challenge to cope with after he had finished shooting the film, knowing that Dahmer had murdered seventeen victims.[15] His performance was well received, and he gained a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Male. He also appeared in Pink's 2003 music video for her song \"Trouble\" as a Bad Boy Sheriff.[16] Renner went on to appear in *S.W.A.T.*[17] as the former police partner of Colin Farrell's character in 2003 and *The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things* in 2004.[18]\n\n\nIn 2005, Renner starred with Julia Stiles and Forest Whitaker in *A Little Trip to Heaven*,[19] with roles in *North Country* and *12 and Holding*.

I love Matt\".[33]\n\n\n\n### 2013\u2013present: continued work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Renner at the *Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters* premiere in 2013\nRenner starred in the action horror film *Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters* (released in January 2013), in which he and Gemma Arterton played Hansel and Gretel, respectively.

The app was created by Escapex, a company that specializes in monetized apps for celebrities.[52] *Fast Company* wrote extensively about Renner's app in April 2019, calling it \"a surprising new kind of social media\".[53]\n\n\nThe community developed to include memes, selfies, and a \"Happy Rennsday\" event on Wednesdays. As early as October 2017, there were claims of censorship, bullying, and \"contest-rigging\". In September 2019, comedian Stefan Heck publicized his discovery of the fact that replies through the app appear as if they were sent by Renner himself in push notifications. After several users abused this feature, Renner asked Escapex to shut down the app.[54][55][56][57][58]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nRenner married Canadian model Sonni Pacheco on January 13, 2014.[59] Renner and Pacheco have a daughter.[60] On December 30, 2014, Pacheco filed for divorce from Renner, citing irreconcilable differences.[61] They share custody of their daughter.[62] Pacheco and their daughter made cameo appearances in the film *American Hustle*.\n\n\nSince 2014, Renner has lived in Washoe County, Nevada,[63][64][65] near Nevada State Route 431 and the Mount Rose ski resort.[66] He has a house-renovating business with his best friend and fellow actor, Kristoffer Winters.[12][67] He has studied Arnis and Muay Thai martial arts as preparation for his roles in the *Mission: Impossible* and *Avengers* franchises.[3][7]\n\n\nRenner is a fan of the San Francisco 49ers.[68] He narrated the NFL Network documentary series *The Timeline* episode \"A Tale of Two Cities\", which chronicles the history of the team's rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys,[69] and the introductory video for the grand opening of Levi's Stadium.[70]\n\n\nOn January 1, 2023, Renner was hospitalized after an accident in which he suffered blunt chest trauma and 30 broken bones from being hit and run over by his snowplow at home.[71][72][73] The snowplow was an extremely large snowcat weighing 14,330 pounds (6,500\u00a0kg).[74] Renner was flown by helicopter[75] to Renown Regional Medical Center (the region's only trauma center).[76] Renner underwent surgery and remained in the intensive care unit in critical condition.[72] By January 17, Renner was released from the hospital and had returned home to continue his recovery.[77] Doctors who treated him said that Renner's physicality and health likely helped him survive the accident, and added that ten weeks after the accident, Renner was beginning to regain enough strength to walk with a cane.[78]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1995\n | *National Lampoon's Senior Trip* | Mark \"Dags\" D'Agastino\n |  |\n| 1996\n | *Paper Dragons* | Jack\n |  |\n| 2001\n | *Fish in a Barrel* | Remy\n |  |\n| 2002\n | *Dahmer* | Jeffrey Dahmer |  |\n| *Monkey Love* | Dil\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *S.W.A.T.* | Brian Gamble\n |  |\n| 2004\n | *The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things* | Emerson\n |  |\n| 2005\n | *A Little Trip to Heaven* | Fred\n |  |\n| *North Country* | Bobby Sharp\n |  |\n| *12 and Holding* | Gus Maitland\n |  |\n| *Neo Ned* | Ned\n |  |\n| *Lords of Dogtown* | Jay Adams' Manager\n | Uncredited[*citation needed*] |\n| 2006\n | *Love Comes to the Executioner* | Chick Prigusivac\n |  |\n| 2007\n | *The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford* | Wood Hite |  |\n| *28 Weeks Later* | Sergeant Doyle\n |  |\n| *Take* | Saul\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *The Hurt Locker* | Sergeant First Class William James\n |  |\n| 2009\n | *Ingenious* | Sam\n | aka *Lightbulb* |\n| 2010\n | *The Town* | James \"Jem\" Coughlin\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Mission: Impossible\u00a0\u2013 Ghost Protocol* | William Brandt\n |  |\n| *Thor* | Clint Barton / Hawkeye | Uncredited cameo[79] |\n| 2012\n | *The Avengers* |  |\n| *The Bourne Legacy* | Aaron Cross / Kenneth J.

This placed him as the seventh-highest-grossing lead actor and the second-highest-grossing actor, behind only voice actor Frank Welker. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJackson's early film roles include *Coming to America* (1988), *Juice* (1992), *True Romance* (1993), *Menace II Society* (1993), and *Fresh* (1994).
