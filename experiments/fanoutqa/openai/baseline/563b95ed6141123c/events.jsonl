The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population,[13] was the site of many of the first civilizations. Its 4.7 billion people[14] constitute roughly 60% of the world's population, having more people than all other continents combined.[15]\n\n\nAsia shares the landmass of Eurasia with Europe, and of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. In general terms, it is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black seas, separating it from Europe.[16]\n\n\nChina and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1,800 CE. China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east,[17][18][19] and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia,[20] attracting European commerce, exploration and colonialism. The accidental discovery of a trans-Atlantic route from Europe to America by Columbus while in search for a route to India demonstrates this deep fascination. The Silk Road became the main east–west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route. Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen.[21] Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, as well as many other religions.\n\n\nGiven its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a name dating back to classical antiquity—may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography.[*citation needed*] Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the Middle East, temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in Siberia.\n\n\n\n\n## Definition and boundaries[edit]\n\n\nFurther information on Asian borders: Geography of Asia § Boundary, Boundaries between continents, List of transcontinental countries § Asia and Europe, and Copenhagen criteria\n\n### Asia–Africa boundary[edit]\n\n\nThe boundary between Asia and Africa is the Red Sea, the Gulf of Suez, and the Suez Canal.[22] This makes Egypt a transcontinental country, with the Sinai peninsula in Asia and the remainder of the country in Africa.\n\n\n\n### Asia–Europe boundary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Definitions used for the boundary between Europe and Asia in different countries around the world\nThe threefold division of the Old World into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus.[*citation needed*] Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni river) in Georgia of Caucasus (from its mouth by Poti on the Black Sea coast, through the Surami Pass and along the Kura River to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BCE.[23] During the Hellenistic period,[24] this convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the Tanais (the modern Don River). This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius,[25] Strabo[26] and Ptolemy.[27]\n\n\nThe border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics.[28] The Don River became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when Peter the Great, king of the Tsardom of Russia, defeating rival claims of Sweden and the Ottoman Empire to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of Siberia, synthesized a new Russian Empire extending to the Ural Mountains and beyond, founded in 1721.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 Philip Johan von Strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the Ural Mountains as the border of Asia. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the Emba River as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.[29] The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the Caucasus Mountains, although it is sometimes placed further north.[28]\n\n\n\n### Asia–Oceania boundary[edit]\n\n\nThe border between Asia and the region of Oceania is usually placed somewhere in the Indonesia Archipelago. The Maluku Islands are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with Indonesian New Guinea, to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Indonesian Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, \"The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process.\"[30]\n\n\n\n### Asia–North America boundary[edit]\n\n\nThe Bering Strait and Bering Sea separate the landmasses of Asia and North America, as well as forming the international boundary between Russia and the United States. This national and continental boundary separates the Diomede Islands in the Bering Strait, with Big Diomede in Russia and Little Diomede in the United States. The Aleutian Islands are an island chain extending westward from the Alaskan Peninsula toward Russia's Komandorski Islands and Kamchatka Peninsula. Most of them are always associated with North America, except for the westernmost Near Islands group, which is on Asia's continental shelf beyond the North Aleutians Basin and on rare occasions could be associated with Asia, which could then allow the U.S. state of Alaska as well as the United States itself to be considered a transcontinental state. The Aleutian Islands are sometimes associated with Oceania, owing to their status as remote Pacific islands, and their proximity to the Pacific Plate.[31][32][33] This is extremely rare however, due to their non-tropical biogeography, as well as their inhabitants, who have historically been related to Indigenous Americans.[34][35]\n\n\nSt. Lawrence Island in the northern Bering Sea belongs to Alaska and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of North America, as with the Rat Islands in the Aleutian chain. At their nearest points, Alaska and Russia are separated by only 4 kilometres (2.5 miles).\n\n\n\n### Ongoing definition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Afro-Eurasia shown in green\nGeographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world, beginning with the Ancient Greeks, being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means. Asia does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.[36]\n\n\nFrom the time of Herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them.[37] For example, Sir Barry Cunliffe, the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely \"the western excrescence of the continent of Asia\".[38]\n\n\nGeographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of Eurasia with Europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass. Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass—Afro-Eurasia (except for the Suez Canal)—and share a common continental shelf. Almost all of Europe and a major part of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate, adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the Chersky Range) on the North American Plate.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ptolemy's Asia\nThe term \"Asia\" is believed to originate in the Bronze Age placename *Assuwa* (Hittite: 𒀸𒋗𒉿, romanized: *aš-šu-wa*) which originally referred only to a portion of northwestern Anatolia. The term appears in Hittite records recounting how a confederation of Assuwan states including Troy unsuccessfully rebelled against the Hittite king Tudhaliya I around 1400 BCE.[39][40][41] Roughly contemporary Linear B documents contain the term *asiwia* (Mycenaean Greek: 𐀀𐀯𐀹𐀊, romanized: *a-si-wi-ja*), seemingly in reference to captives from the same area.[42][43]\n\n\n\n![](image)The province of Asia highlighted (in red) within the Roman Empire\nHerodotus used the term Ἀσία in reference to Anatolia and the territory of the Persian Empire, in contrast to Greece and Egypt. He reports that Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of Prometheus, but that Lydians say it was named after *Asies*, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis.[44] In Greek mythology, \"Asia\" (*Ἀσία*) or \"Asie\" (*Ἀσίη*) was the name of a \"Nymph or Titan goddess of Lydia\".[45] The Iliad (attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer) mentions two Phrygians in the Trojan War named Asios (an adjective meaning \"Asian\");[46] and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as ασιος.[47] According to many Muslims, the term came from Ancient Egypt's Queen Asiya, the adoptive mother of Moses.[48]\n\n\nThe term was later adopted by the Romans, who used it in reference to the province of Asia, located in western Anatolia.[49] One of the first writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was Pliny.[50]\n\n\nIn languages of the Chinese character cultural sphere words related to the character 亜細亜 Yàxìyà are used. This has been criticized as implying an inferiority of the continent as 亜 means inferior. However it is a mere phonetic representation.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Asia\n\n![](image)The Silk Road connected civilizations across Asia.[51]\n![](image)The Mongol Empire at its greatest extent. The gray area is the later Timurid Empire.\nThe history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East (West Asia), linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian steppes.\nThe coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and the Yellow River shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.\n\n\nThe central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo-Europeans, who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the Tocharians resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of Siberia, was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and tundra. These areas remained very sparsely populated.\n\n\nThe center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The Caucasus and Himalaya mountains and the Karakum and Gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.\n\n\nThe Islamic Caliphate's defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West Asia and southern parts of Central Asia and western parts of South Asia under its control during its conquests of the 7th century. The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, Song dynasty reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.[52]\n\n\nThe Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the Silk Road.[53]\n\n\nThe Russian Empire began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The Ottoman Empire controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the Manchu conquered China and established the Qing dynasty. The Islamic Mughal Empire and the Hindu Maratha Empire controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.[54]\n\n\nWestern European colonisation of Asia coincided with the Industrial Revolution in the West and the dethroning of India and China as the world's foremost economies.[55] The British Empire became dominant in South Asia, with large parts of the region first being conquered by British traders before falling under direct British rule; extreme poverty doubled to over 50% during this era.[56] The Middle East was contested and partitioned by the British and French,[57] while Southeast Asia was carved up between the British, Dutch and French.[58] Various Western powers dominated China in what later became known as the \"century of humiliation\", with the British-supported opium trade and later Opium Wars resulting in China being forced into an unprecedented situation of importing more than it exported.[59][60] Foreign domination of China was furthered by the Empire of Japan, which controlled most of East Asia and much of Southeast Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands during this era; Japan's domination was enabled by its rapid rise that had taken place during the Meiji era of the late 19th century, in which it applied industrial knowledge learned from the West and thus overtook the rest of Asia.[61][62]\n\n\nWith the end of World War II in 1945 and the wartime ruination of Europe and imperial Japan, many countries in Asia were able to rapidly free themselves of colonial rule.[63] The independence of India came along with the carving out of a separate nation for the majority of Indian Muslims, which today has become the countries Pakistan and Bangladesh.[64]\n\n\nSome Arab countries took economic advantage of massive oil deposits that were discovered in their territory, becoming globally influential.[65] East Asian nations (along with Singapore in Southeast Asia) became economically prosperous with high-growth \"tiger economies\",[66] with China regaining its place among the top two economies of the world by the 21st century.[67] India has grown significantly because of economic liberalisation that started in the 1990s,[68] with extreme poverty now below 20%.[69]\n\n\n\n* ![The threefold division of the Old World into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus.](image)\n\nThe threefold division of the Old World into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus.\n* ![1825 map of Asia by Sidney Edwards Morse](image)\n\n1825 map of Asia by Sidney Edwards Morse\n* ![Map of western, southern, and central Asia in 1885[70]](image)\n\nMap of western, southern, and central Asia in 1885[70]\n* ![The map of Asia in 1796, which also included the continent of Australia (then known as New Holland)](image)\n\nThe map of Asia in 1796, which also included the continent of Australia (then known as New Holland)\n* ![1890 map of Asia](image)\n\n1890 map of Asia\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Asia\n\nSee also: Category:Biota of Asia\n\n![](image)The Himalayan range is home to some of the planet's highest peaks.\nAsia is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at 62,800 kilometres (39,022 mi). Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia. It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma–Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas.[16][71] It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe. Geographically, Russia is partly in Asia, but is considered a European nation, both culturally and politically.\n\n\nThe Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East. The Yangtze River in China is the longest river in the continent. The Himalayas between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.\n\n\n\n* ![Siberian tundra](image)\n\nSiberian tundra\n* ![Rainforest in Borneo](image)\n\nRainforest in Borneo\n* ![Kerala backwaters](image)\n\nKerala backwaters\n* ![Mongolian steppe](image)\n\nMongolian steppe\n* ![South China Karst](image)\n\nSouth China Karst\n* ![Taman Negara, Peninsular Malaysia](image)\n\nTaman Negara, Peninsular Malaysia\n* ![Altai Mountains](image)\n\nAltai Mountains\n* ![Hunza Valley](image)\n\nHunza Valley\n* ![Atolls of the Maldives](image)\n\nAtolls of the Maldives\n* ![Wadi Rum in Jordan](image)\n\nWadi Rum in Jordan\n\n\n### Main regions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Division of Asia into regions by the UNSD * North Asia\n* Central Asia\n* West Asia (Near East)\n* South Asia\n* East Asia (Far East)\n* Southeast Asia\n\nThere are various approaches to the regional division of Asia. The following subdivision into regions is used, among others, by the UN statistics agency UNSD. This division of Asia into regions by the United Nations is done solely for statistical reasons and does not imply any assumption about political or other affiliations of countries and territories.[72]\n\n\n\n* North Asia (Siberia)[note 4]\n* Central Asia (The 'stans)\n* West Asia (The Middle East or Near East and the Caucasus)\n* South Asia (Indian subcontinent)\n* East Asia (Far East)\n* Southeast Asia (East Indies and Indochina)\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Asia\n\n![](image)Köppen-Geiger climate classification map for Asia[73]\nAsia has extremely diverse climate features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan.\n\n\n\n#### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Climate change in South Asia, Climate change in Southeast Asia, Climate change in Central Asia, Climate change in East Asia, and Climate change in North Asia\n\nFurther information: Category:Climate change in Asia\n\nClimate change is having major impacts on many countries in the continent.\nA survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm Maplecroft identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan, China and Sri Lanka were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change.[74][75][76] Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a semi-arid climate, the temperature increased by 0.4 °C between 1901 and 2003.\nA 2013 study by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefiting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use renewable energy.[77]\n\n\nThe ten countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam – are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change in the world, however, ASEAN's climate mitigation efforts are not commensurate with the climate threats and risks it faces.[78]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Asia, List of Asian countries by GDP, List of countries in Asia-Pacific by GDP (nominal), and List of Asian and Pacific countries by GDP (PPP)\n\n![](image)Singapore has one of the busiest container ports in the world and is the world's fourth largest foreign exchange trading center.\nAsia has the largest continental economy in the world by both GDP nominal and PPP values, and is the fastest growing economic region.[79] As of 2023[update], China is by far the largest economy on the continent, making up nearly half of the continent's economy by GDP nominal. It is followed by Japan, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which are all ranked amongst the top 20 largest economies both by nominal and PPP values.[80] Based on Global Office Locations 2011, Asia dominated the office locations with 4 of the top 5 being in Asia: Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. Around 68 percent of international firms have an office in Hong Kong.[81]\n\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economies of China[82] and India grew rapidly, both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8%. Other recent very-high-growth nations in Asia include Israel, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines, and mineral-rich nations such as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Brunei, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to economic historian Angus Maddison in his book *The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective*, India had the world's largest economy during 0 BCE and 1000 BCE. Historically, India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until 19th century, contributing 25% of the world's industrial output.[83][84][85][86] China was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history and shared the mantle with India.[87][18][88] For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the Soviet Union (measured in net material product) in 1990 and Germany in 1968. (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or APEC). This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy. It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2027.[79]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP by currency exchange rates was almost as large as that of the rest of Asia combined.[79] In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the US as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen/US$. Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim, known as the Asian tigers, which are now all considered developed economies, having amongst the highest GDP per capita in Asia.[89][79]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mumbai is one of the most populous cities on the continent. The city is an infrastructure and tourism hub, and plays a crucial role in the economy of India.\nAsia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to Citigroup in 2011, 9 of 11 Global Growth Generators countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth. They are Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.[90] Asia has three main financial centers: Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore. Call centers and business process outsourcing (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, English-speaking workers. The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers. Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTrade between Asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for Asia. Individual main routes have emerged from this. The main route leads from the Chinese coast south via Hanoi to Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur through the Strait of Malacca via the Sri Lankan Colombo to the southern tip of India via Malé to East Africa Mombasa, from there to Djibouti, then through the Red Sea over the Suez Canal into Mediterranean, there via Haifa, Istanbul and Athens to the upper Adriatic to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe or further to Barcelona and around Spain and France to the European northern ports. A far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via South Africa to Europe. A particularly significant part of the Asian goods traffic is carried out across the Pacific towards Los Angeles and Long Beach. In contrast to the sea routes, the Silk Road via the land route to Europe is on the one hand still under construction and on the other hand is much smaller in terms of scope. Intra-Asian trade, including sea trade, is growing rapidly.[91][92][93][94][95][96][97][98]\n\n\nIn 2010, Asia had 3.3 million millionaires (people with net worth over US$1 million excluding their homes), slightly below North America with 3.4 million millionaires. Last year Asia had toppled Europe.[99]\nCitigroup in The Wealth Report 2012 stated that Asian centa-millionaire overtook North America's wealth for the first time as the world's \"economic center of gravity\" continued moving east. At the end of 2011, there were 18,000 Asian people mainly in Southeast Asia, China and Japan who have at least $100 million in disposable assets, while North America with 17,000 people and Western Europe with 14,000 people.[100]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (nominal, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) China | 17,700,899 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Japan | 4,230,862 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) India | 3,732,224 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Russia | 1,862,470 | 2023\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) South Korea | 1,709,232 | 2021\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Indonesia | 1,417,387 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Turkey | 1,154,600 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | 1,069,437 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Taiwan | 751,930 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Israel | 521,688 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (PPP, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) China | 32,897,929 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) India | 13,119,622 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Japan | 6,495,214 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Russia[101] | 5,326,855 | 2022\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Indonesia | 4,393,370 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Turkey | 3,613,540 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) South Korea | 2,924,189 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | 2,246,535 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Egypt | 1,809,425 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Iran | 1,725,874 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![A Thai temple complex with several ornate buildings, and a lot of visitors](image)Wat Phra Kaew in the Grand Palace is among Bangkok's major tourist attractions.\nSee also the categories Tourism in Asia and Transport in Asia\n\nWith growing Regional Tourism with domination of Chinese visitors, MasterCard has released Global Destination Cities Index 2013 with 10 of 20 are dominated by Asia and Pacific Region Cities and also for the first time a city of a country from Asia (Bangkok) set in the top-ranked with 15.98 million international visitors.[102]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Asia\n\nSee also: List of Asian countries by population and List of Asian countries by life expectancy\n\n\n\nHistorical populations| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1500  | 243,000,000 | —     |\n| 1700  | 436,000,000 | +0.29% |\n| 1900  | 947,000,000 | +0.39% |\n| 1950  | 1,402,000,000 | +0.79% |\n| 1999  | 3,634,000,000 | +1.96% |\n| 2016 | 4,462,676,731 | +1.22% |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since\n1970, is the only country on the \"Top 10 Movers\" list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region's top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy.[103]\n  \nNepal, a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world's fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements. Its present life expectancy is 25 years longer than in the 1970s. More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago.[103]\n  \n Hong Kong ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 7 in the world, which is in the \"very high human development\" category), followed by Singapore (9), Japan (19) and South Korea (22). Afghanistan (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.[103]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Asia\n\nAsia is home to several language families and many language isolates. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to Ethnologue, more than 700 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 400 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.\n\n\n\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eastern philosophy, Religion in Asia, and List of Asian mythologies\n\nMany of the world's major religions have their origins in Asia, including the five most practiced in the world (excluding irreligion), which are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion (classified as Confucianism and Taoism), and Buddhism respectively. Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the Great Flood for example, as presented to Jews in the Hebrew Bible in the narrative of Noah—and later to Christians in the Old Testament, and to Muslims in the Quran—is earliest found in Mesopotamian mythology, in the Enûma Eliš and *Epic of Gilgamesh*. Hindu mythology similarly tells about an avatar of Vishnu in the form of a fish who warned Manu of a terrible flood. Ancient Chinese mythology also tells of a Great Flood spanning generations, one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control.\n\n\n\n#### Abrahamic[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Christianity in Asia and Islam in Asia\n\n![](image)The Western Wall and the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem\n![](image)The Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem\n![](image)Pilgrims in the annual Hajj at the Kaabah in Mecca\nThe Abrahamic religions including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Druze faith,[104] and Baháʼí Faith originated in West Asia.[105][106]\n\n\nJudaism, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in Israel, the indigenous homeland and historical birthplace of the Hebrew nation: which today consists both of those Jews who remained in the Middle East and those who returned from diaspora in Europe, North America, and other regions;[107] though various diaspora communities persist worldwide. Jews are the predominant ethnic group in Israel (75.6%) numbering at about 6.1 million,[108] although the levels of adherence to Jewish religion vary. Outside of Israel there are small ancient Jewish communities in Turkey (17,400),[109] Azerbaijan (9,100),[110] Iran (8,756),[111] India (5,000) and Uzbekistan (4,000),[112] among many other places. In total, there are 14.4–17.5 million (2016, est.)[113] Jews alive in the world today, making them one of the smallest Asian minorities, at roughly 0.3 to 0.4 percent of the total population of the continent.\n\n\nChristianity is a widespread religion in Asia with more than 286 million adherents according to Pew Research Center in 2010,[114] and nearly 364 million according to Britannica Book of the Year 2014.[115] Constituting around 12.6% of the total population of Asia. In the Philippines and East Timor, Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion;[116] it was introduced by the Spaniards and the Portuguese, respectively. In Armenia and Georgia, Eastern Orthodoxy is the predominant religion.[116] In the Middle East, such as in the Levant, Anatolia and Fars, Syriac Christianity (Church of the East) and Oriental Orthodoxy are prevalent minority denominations,[117] which are both Eastern Christian sects mainly adhered to Assyrian people or Syriac Christians. Vibrant indigenous minorities in West Asia are adhering to the Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodoxy.[116] Saint Thomas Christians in India trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century.[118] Significant Christian communities also found in Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia.[116]\n\n\nIslam, which originated in the Hejaz located in modern-day Saudi Arabia, is the second largest and most widely-spread religion in Asia with at least 1 billion Muslims constituting around 23.8% of the total population of Asia.[119] With 12.7% of the world Muslim population, the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is Indonesia, followed by Pakistan (11.5%), India (10%), Bangladesh, Iran and Turkey. Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are the three holiest cities for Islam in all the world. The Hajj and Umrah attract large numbers of Muslim devotees from all over the world to Mecca and Medina. Iran is the largest Shi'a country.\n\n\nThe Druze Faith or Druzism originated in West Asia, is a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of figures like Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, and Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. The number of Druze people worldwide is around one million, with about 45% to 50% live in Syria, 35% to 40% live in Lebanon, and less than 10% live in Israel, with recently there has been a growing Druze diaspora.[120]\n\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh. Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because Baháʼí activities in many Muslim countries has been severely suppressed by authorities. Lotus Temple is a big Baháʼí Temple in India.\n\n\n\n#### Indian and East Asian religions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Swaminarayan Akshardham Temple in Delhi, according to the Guinness World Records, is the *World's Largest Comprehensive Hindu Temple*.[121]\nAlmost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. Indian philosophy includes Hindu philosophy and Buddhist philosophy. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, Cārvāka, preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, Confucianism, Taoism and Zen Buddhism took shape.\n\n\nAs of 2012[update], Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bali, Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hindu-Buddhist temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, the largest religious monument in the world\nBuddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia. Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of Cambodia (96%),[122] Thailand (95%),[123] Burma (80–89%),[124] Japan (36–96%),[125] Bhutan (75–84%),[126] Sri Lanka (70%),[127] Laos (60–67%)[128] and Mongolia (53–93%).[129] Taiwan (35–93%),[130][131][132][133] South Korea (23–50%),[134] Malaysia (19–21%),[135] Nepal (9–11%),[136] Vietnam (10–75%),[137] China (20–50%),[138] North Korea (2–14%),[139][140][141] and small communities in India and Bangladesh. The Communist-governed countries of China, Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist, thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be under-reported.\n\n\nJainism is found mainly in India and in overseas Indian communities such as the United States and Malaysia. Sikhism is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia, especially Southeast Asia. Confucianism is found predominantly in Mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations. Taoism is found mainly in Mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. In many Chinese communities, Taoism is easily syncretized with Mahayana Buddhism, thus exact religious statistics are difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.\n\n\n\n* ![Japanese wedding at the Meiji Shrine](image)\n\nJapanese wedding at the Meiji Shrine\n* ![Hindu festival celebrated by Singapore's Tamil community](image)\n\nHindu festival celebrated by Singapore's Tamil community\n* ![Bar mitzvah at the Western Wall in Jerusalem](image)\n\nBar mitzvah at the Western Wall in Jerusalem\n* ![Catholic procession of the Black Nazarene in Manila](image)\n\nCatholic procession of the Black Nazarene in Manila\n* ![Druze dignitaries celebrating the Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu'ayb festival at the tomb of the prophet in Hittin](image)\n\nDruze dignitaries celebrating the Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu'ayb festival at the tomb of the prophet in Hittin\n* ![Christian Armenians praying at the Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat](image)\n\nChristian Armenians praying at the Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat\n* ![Muslim men praying at the Ortaköy Mosque in Istanbul](image)\n\nMuslim men praying at the Ortaköy Mosque in Istanbul\n* ![Buddhist Monks performing traditional Sand mandala made from coloured sand](image)\n\nBuddhist Monks performing traditional Sand mandala made from coloured sand\n\n\n## Modern conflicts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A refugee special train in Ambala, Punjab during the partition of India in 1947\n![](image)US forces drop Napalm on suspected Viet Cong positions in 1965.\n![](image)Wounded civilians arrive at a hospital in Aleppo during the Syrian Civil War, October 2012.\n![](image)Demonstrations in Hong Kong against the Extradition bill began in March 2019 and turned into continuing mass movements, drawing around 2 million protesters by June\nSome of the events pivotal in the Asia territory related to the relationship with the outside world in the post-Second World War were:\n\n\n\n* The Partition of India\n* The Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948\n* The Chinese Civil War\n* The Kashmir conflict\n* The Balochistan Conflict\n* The Naxalite–Maoist insurgency in India\n* The Korean War\n* The French Indochina War\n* The Vietnam War\n* The Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation\n* The 1959 Tibetan uprising\n* The Sino-Vietnamese War\n* The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971\n* The Bangladesh Liberation War\n* The Yom Kippur War\n* The Indo-Pakistani war of 1965\n* The Xinjiang conflict\n* The Iranian Revolution\n* The Soviet–Afghan War\n* The Iran–Iraq War\n* The Cambodian Killing Fields\n* The Insurgency in Laos\n* The Lebanese Civil War\n* The Sri Lankan Civil War\n* The 1988 Maldives coup d'état\n* The Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n* The Gulf War\n* The Nepalese Civil War\n* The Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts\n* The West Papua conflict\n* The First Nagorno-Karabakh War\n* The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests\n* The Indonesian occupation of East Timor\n* The Kargil War\n* The 1999 Pakistani coup d'état\n* The War in Afghanistan\n* The Iraq War\n* The South Thailand insurgency\n* The 2006 Thai coup d'état\n* The Burmese Civil War\n* The Saffron Revolution\n* The Kurdish–Turkish conflict\n* The Arab Spring\n* The Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n* The Arab–Israeli conflict\n* The Syrian Civil War\n* The Sino-Indian War\n* The 2014 Thai coup d'état\n* The Moro conflict in the Philippines\n* The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n* The Turkish invasion of Syria\n* The Rohingya crisis in Myanmar\n* The Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen\n* The Hong Kong protests\n* The 2020 China–India skirmishes\n* The Sino-Indian border dispute\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Asia\n\nThe culture of Asia is a diverse blend of customs and traditions that have been practiced by the various ethnic groups of the continent for centuries. The continent is divided into six geographic sub-regions: Central Asia, East Asia, North Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Asia.[142] These regions are defined by their cultural similarities, including common religions, languages, and ethnicities. West Asia, also known as Southwest Asia or the Middle East, has cultural roots in the ancient civilizations of the Fertile Crescent and Mesopotamia, which gave rise to the Persian, Arab, Ottoman empires, as well as the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.[143] These civilizations, which are located in the Hilly flanks, are among the oldest in the world, with evidence of farming dating back to around 9000 BCE.[144] Despite the challenges posed by the vast size of the continent and the presence of natural barriers such as deserts and mountain ranges, trade and commerce have helped to create a Pan-Asian culture that is shared across the region.[145]\n\n\n\n### Nobel prizes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Indian polymath Rabindranath Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, and became Asia's first Nobel laureate.\nThe polymath Rabindranath Tagore, a Bengali poet, dramatist, and writer from Santiniketan, now in West Bengal, India, became in 1913 the first Asian Nobel laureate. He won his Nobel Prize in Literature for notable impact his prose works and poetic thought had on English, French, and other national literatures of Europe and the Americas. He is also the writer of the national anthems of Bangladesh and India.\n\n\nOther Asian writers who won Nobel Prize for literature include Yasunari Kawabata (Japan, 1968), Kenzaburō Ōe (Japan, 1994), Gao Xingjian (China, 2000), Orhan Pamuk (Turkey, 2006), and Mo Yan (China, 2012). Some may consider the American writer, Pearl S. Buck, an honorary Asian Nobel laureate, having spent considerable time in China as the daughter of missionaries, and based many of her novels, namely *The Good Earth* (1931) and *The Mother* (1933), as well as the biographies of her parents for their time in China, *The Exile* and *Fighting Angel*, all of which earned her the Literature prize in 1938.\n\n\nAlso, Mother Teresa of India and Shirin Ebadi of Iran were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their significant and pioneering efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children. Ebadi is the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to receive the prize. Another Nobel Peace Prize winner is Aung San Suu Kyi from Burma for her peaceful and non-violent struggle under a military dictatorship in Burma. She is a nonviolent pro-democracy activist and leader of the National League for Democracy in Burma (Myanmar) and a noted prisoner of conscience. She is a Buddhist and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for \"his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China\" on 8 October 2010. He is the first Chinese citizen to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China. In 2014, Kailash Satyarthi from India and Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \"for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education\".\n\n\nSir C.V. Raman is the first Asian to get a Nobel prize in Sciences. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him\".\n\n\nJapan has won the most Nobel Prizes of any Asian nation with 24 followed by India which has won 13.\n\n\nAmartya Sen, (born 3 November 1933) is an Indian economist who was awarded the 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his contributions to welfare economics and social choice theory, and for his interest in the problems of society's poorest members.\n\n\nOther Asian Nobel Prize winners include Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Abdus Salam, Malala Yousafzai, Robert Aumann, Menachem Begin, Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko, Daniel Kahneman, Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, Ada Yonath, Yasser Arafat, José Ramos-Horta and Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo of Timor Leste, Kim Dae-jung, and 13 Japanese scientists. Most of the said awardees are from Japan and Israel except for Chandrasekhar and Raman (India), Abdus Salam and Malala Yousafzai, (Pakistan), Arafat (Palestinian Territories), Kim (South Korea), and Horta and Belo (Timor Leste).\n\n\nIn 2006, Dr. Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for the establishment of Grameen Bank, a community development bank that lends money to poor people, especially women in Bangladesh. Dr. Yunus received his PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University, United States. He is internationally known for the concept of micro credit which allows poor and destitute people with little or no collateral to borrow money. The borrowers typically pay back money within the specified period and the incidence of default is very low.\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama has received approximately eighty-four awards over his spiritual and political career.[146] On 22 June 2006, he became one of only four people ever to be recognized with Honorary Citizenship by the Governor General of Canada.

The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population,[13] was the site of many of the first civilizations. Its 4.7 billion people[14] constitute roughly 60% of the world's population, having more people than all other continents combined.[15]\n\n\nAsia shares the landmass of Eurasia with Europe, and of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. In general terms, it is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black seas, separating it from Europe.[16]\n\n\nChina and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1,800 CE. China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east,[17][18][19] and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia,[20] attracting European commerce, exploration and colonialism. The accidental discovery of a trans-Atlantic route from Europe to America by Columbus while in search for a route to India demonstrates this deep fascination. The Silk Road became the main east–west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route. Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen.[21] Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, as well as many other religions.\n\n\nGiven its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a name dating back to classical antiquity—may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography.[*citation needed*] Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the Middle East, temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in Siberia.\n\n\n\n\n## Definition and boundaries[edit]\n\n\nFurther information on Asian borders: Geography of Asia § Boundary, Boundaries between continents, List of transcontinental countries § Asia and Europe, and Copenhagen criteria\n\n### Asia–Africa boundary[edit]\n\n\nThe boundary between Asia and Africa is the Red Sea, the Gulf of Suez, and the Suez Canal.[22] This makes Egypt a transcontinental country, with the Sinai peninsula in Asia and the remainder of the country in Africa.\n\n\n\n### Asia–Europe boundary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Definitions used for the boundary between Europe and Asia in different countries around the world\nThe threefold division of the Old World into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus.[*citation needed*] Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni river) in Georgia of Caucasus (from its mouth by Poti on the Black Sea coast, through the Surami Pass and along the Kura River to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BCE.[23] During the Hellenistic period,[24] this convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the Tanais (the modern Don River). This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius,[25] Strabo[26] and Ptolemy.[27]\n\n\nThe border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics.[28] The Don River became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when Peter the Great, king of the Tsardom of Russia, defeating rival claims of Sweden and the Ottoman Empire to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of Siberia, synthesized a new Russian Empire extending to the Ural Mountains and beyond, founded in 1721.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 Philip Johan von Strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the Ural Mountains as the border of Asia. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the Emba River as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.[29] The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the Caucasus Mountains, although it is sometimes placed further north.[28]\n\n\n\n### Asia–Oceania boundary[edit]\n\n\nThe border between Asia and the region of Oceania is usually placed somewhere in the Indonesia Archipelago. The Maluku Islands are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with Indonesian New Guinea, to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Indonesian Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, \"The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process.\"[30]\n\n\n\n### Asia–North America boundary[edit]\n\n\nThe Bering Strait and Bering Sea separate the landmasses of Asia and North America, as well as forming the international boundary between Russia and the United States. This national and continental boundary separates the Diomede Islands in the Bering Strait, with Big Diomede in Russia and Little Diomede in the United States. The Aleutian Islands are an island chain extending westward from the Alaskan Peninsula toward Russia's Komandorski Islands and Kamchatka Peninsula. Most of them are always associated with North America, except for the westernmost Near Islands group, which is on Asia's continental shelf beyond the North Aleutians Basin and on rare occasions could be associated with Asia, which could then allow the U.S. state of Alaska as well as the United States itself to be considered a transcontinental state. The Aleutian Islands are sometimes associated with Oceania, owing to their status as remote Pacific islands, and their proximity to the Pacific Plate.[31][32][33] This is extremely rare however, due to their non-tropical biogeography, as well as their inhabitants, who have historically been related to Indigenous Americans.[34][35]\n\n\nSt. Lawrence Island in the northern Bering Sea belongs to Alaska and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of North America, as with the Rat Islands in the Aleutian chain. At their nearest points, Alaska and Russia are separated by only 4 kilometres (2.5 miles).\n\n\n\n### Ongoing definition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Afro-Eurasia shown in green\nGeographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world, beginning with the Ancient Greeks, being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means. Asia does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.[36]\n\n\nFrom the time of Herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them.[37] For example, Sir Barry Cunliffe, the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely \"the western excrescence of the continent of Asia\".[38]\n\n\nGeographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of Eurasia with Europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass. Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass—Afro-Eurasia (except for the Suez Canal)—and share a common continental shelf. Almost all of Europe and a major part of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate, adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the Chersky Range) on the North American Plate.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ptolemy's Asia\nThe term \"Asia\" is believed to originate in the Bronze Age placename *Assuwa* (Hittite: 𒀸𒋗𒉿, romanized: *aš-šu-wa*) which originally referred only to a portion of northwestern Anatolia. The term appears in Hittite records recounting how a confederation of Assuwan states including Troy unsuccessfully rebelled against the Hittite king Tudhaliya I around 1400 BCE.[39][40][41] Roughly contemporary Linear B documents contain the term *asiwia* (Mycenaean Greek: 𐀀𐀯𐀹𐀊, romanized: *a-si-wi-ja*), seemingly in reference to captives from the same area.[42][43]\n\n\n\n![](image)The province of Asia highlighted (in red) within the Roman Empire\nHerodotus used the term Ἀσία in reference to Anatolia and the territory of the Persian Empire, in contrast to Greece and Egypt. He reports that Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of Prometheus, but that Lydians say it was named after *Asies*, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis.[44] In Greek mythology, \"Asia\" (*Ἀσία*) or \"Asie\" (*Ἀσίη*) was the name of a \"Nymph or Titan goddess of Lydia\".[45] The Iliad (attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer) mentions two Phrygians in the Trojan War named Asios (an adjective meaning \"Asian\");[46] and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as ασιος.[47] According to many Muslims, the term came from Ancient Egypt's Queen Asiya, the adoptive mother of Moses.[48]\n\n\nThe term was later adopted by the Romans, who used it in reference to the province of Asia, located in western Anatolia.[49] One of the first writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was Pliny.[50]\n\n\nIn languages of the Chinese character cultural sphere words related to the character 亜細亜 Yàxìyà are used. This has been criticized as implying an inferiority of the continent as 亜 means inferior. However it is a mere phonetic representation.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Asia\n\n![](image)The Silk Road connected civilizations across Asia.[51]\n![](image)The Mongol Empire at its greatest extent. The gray area is the later Timurid Empire.\nThe history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East (West Asia), linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian steppes.\nThe coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and the Yellow River shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.\n\n\nThe central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo-Europeans, who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the Tocharians resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of Siberia, was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and tundra. These areas remained very sparsely populated.\n\n\nThe center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The Caucasus and Himalaya mountains and the Karakum and Gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.\n\n\nThe Islamic Caliphate's defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West Asia and southern parts of Central Asia and western parts of South Asia under its control during its conquests of the 7th century. The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, Song dynasty reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.[52]\n\n\nThe Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the Silk Road.[53]\n\n\nThe Russian Empire began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The Ottoman Empire controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the Manchu conquered China and established the Qing dynasty. The Islamic Mughal Empire and the Hindu Maratha Empire controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.[54]\n\n\nWestern European colonisation of Asia coincided with the Industrial Revolution in the West and the dethroning of India and China as the world's foremost economies.[55] The British Empire became dominant in South Asia, with large parts of the region first being conquered by British traders before falling under direct British rule; extreme poverty doubled to over 50% during this era.[56] The Middle East was contested and partitioned by the British and French,[57] while Southeast Asia was carved up between the British, Dutch and French.[58] Various Western powers dominated China in what later became known as the \"century of humiliation\", with the British-supported opium trade and later Opium Wars resulting in China being forced into an unprecedented situation of importing more than it exported.[59][60] Foreign domination of China was furthered by the Empire of Japan, which controlled most of East Asia and much of Southeast Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands during this era; Japan's domination was enabled by its rapid rise that had taken place during the Meiji era of the late 19th century, in which it applied industrial knowledge learned from the West and thus overtook the rest of Asia.[61][62]\n\n\nWith the end of World War II in 1945 and the wartime ruination of Europe and imperial Japan, many countries in Asia were able to rapidly free themselves of colonial rule.[63] The independence of India came along with the carving out of a separate nation for the majority of Indian Muslims, which today has become the countries Pakistan and Bangladesh.[64]\n\n\nSome Arab countries took economic advantage of massive oil deposits that were discovered in their territory, becoming globally influential.[65] East Asian nations (along with Singapore in Southeast Asia) became economically prosperous with high-growth \"tiger economies\",[66] with China regaining its place among the top two economies of the world by the 21st century.[67] India has grown significantly because of economic liberalisation that started in the 1990s,[68] with extreme poverty now below 20%.[69]\n\n\n\n* ![The threefold division of the Old World into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus.](image)\n\nThe threefold division of the Old World into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BCE, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus.\n* ![1825 map of Asia by Sidney Edwards Morse](image)\n\n1825 map of Asia by Sidney Edwards Morse\n* ![Map of western, southern, and central Asia in 1885[70]](image)\n\nMap of western, southern, and central Asia in 1885[70]\n* ![The map of Asia in 1796, which also included the continent of Australia (then known as New Holland)](image)\n\nThe map of Asia in 1796, which also included the continent of Australia (then known as New Holland)\n* ![1890 map of Asia](image)\n\n1890 map of Asia\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Asia\n\nSee also: Category:Biota of Asia\n\n![](image)The Himalayan range is home to some of the planet's highest peaks.\nAsia is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at 62,800 kilometres (39,022 mi). Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia. It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma–Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas.[16][71] It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe. Geographically, Russia is partly in Asia, but is considered a European nation, both culturally and politically.\n\n\nThe Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East. The Yangtze River in China is the longest river in the continent. The Himalayas between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.\n\n\n\n* ![Siberian tundra](image)\n\nSiberian tundra\n* ![Rainforest in Borneo](image)\n\nRainforest in Borneo\n* ![Kerala backwaters](image)\n\nKerala backwaters\n* ![Mongolian steppe](image)\n\nMongolian steppe\n* ![South China Karst](image)\n\nSouth China Karst\n* ![Taman Negara, Peninsular Malaysia](image)\n\nTaman Negara, Peninsular Malaysia\n* ![Altai Mountains](image)\n\nAltai Mountains\n* ![Hunza Valley](image)\n\nHunza Valley\n* ![Atolls of the Maldives](image)\n\nAtolls of the Maldives\n* ![Wadi Rum in Jordan](image)\n\nWadi Rum in Jordan\n\n\n### Main regions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Division of Asia into regions by the UNSD * North Asia\n* Central Asia\n* West Asia (Near East)\n* South Asia\n* East Asia (Far East)\n* Southeast Asia\n\nThere are various approaches to the regional division of Asia. The following subdivision into regions is used, among others, by the UN statistics agency UNSD. This division of Asia into regions by the United Nations is done solely for statistical reasons and does not imply any assumption about political or other affiliations of countries and territories.[72]\n\n\n\n* North Asia (Siberia)[note 4]\n* Central Asia (The 'stans)\n* West Asia (The Middle East or Near East and the Caucasus)\n* South Asia (Indian subcontinent)\n* East Asia (Far East)\n* Southeast Asia (East Indies and Indochina)\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Asia\n\n![](image)Köppen-Geiger climate classification map for Asia[73]\nAsia has extremely diverse climate features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan.\n\n\n\n#### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Climate change in South Asia, Climate change in Southeast Asia, Climate change in Central Asia, Climate change in East Asia, and Climate change in North Asia\n\nFurther information: Category:Climate change in Asia\n\nClimate change is having major impacts on many countries in the continent.\nA survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm Maplecroft identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan, China and Sri Lanka were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change.[74][75][76] Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a semi-arid climate, the temperature increased by 0.4 °C between 1901 and 2003.\nA 2013 study by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefiting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use renewable energy.[77]\n\n\nThe ten countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam – are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change in the world, however, ASEAN's climate mitigation efforts are not commensurate with the climate threats and risks it faces.[78]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Asia, List of Asian countries by GDP, List of countries in Asia-Pacific by GDP (nominal), and List of Asian and Pacific countries by GDP (PPP)\n\n![](image)Singapore has one of the busiest container ports in the world and is the world's fourth largest foreign exchange trading center.\nAsia has the largest continental economy in the world by both GDP nominal and PPP values, and is the fastest growing economic region.[79] As of 2023[update], China is by far the largest economy on the continent, making up nearly half of the continent's economy by GDP nominal. It is followed by Japan, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which are all ranked amongst the top 20 largest economies both by nominal and PPP values.[80] Based on Global Office Locations 2011, Asia dominated the office locations with 4 of the top 5 being in Asia: Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. Around 68 percent of international firms have an office in Hong Kong.[81]\n\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the economies of China[82] and India grew rapidly, both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8%. Other recent very-high-growth nations in Asia include Israel, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines, and mineral-rich nations such as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Brunei, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to economic historian Angus Maddison in his book *The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective*, India had the world's largest economy during 0 BCE and 1000 BCE. Historically, India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until 19th century, contributing 25% of the world's industrial output.[83][84][85][86] China was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history and shared the mantle with India.[87][18][88] For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the Soviet Union (measured in net material product) in 1990 and Germany in 1968. (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or APEC). This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy. It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2027.[79]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP by currency exchange rates was almost as large as that of the rest of Asia combined.[79] In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the US as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen/US$. Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim, known as the Asian tigers, which are now all considered developed economies, having amongst the highest GDP per capita in Asia.[89][79]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mumbai is one of the most populous cities on the continent. The city is an infrastructure and tourism hub, and plays a crucial role in the economy of India.\nAsia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to Citigroup in 2011, 9 of 11 Global Growth Generators countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth. They are Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.[90] Asia has three main financial centers: Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore. Call centers and business process outsourcing (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, English-speaking workers. The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers. Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTrade between Asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for Asia. Individual main routes have emerged from this. The main route leads from the Chinese coast south via Hanoi to Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur through the Strait of Malacca via the Sri Lankan Colombo to the southern tip of India via Malé to East Africa Mombasa, from there to Djibouti, then through the Red Sea over the Suez Canal into Mediterranean, there via Haifa, Istanbul and Athens to the upper Adriatic to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe or further to Barcelona and around Spain and France to the European northern ports. A far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via South Africa to Europe. A particularly significant part of the Asian goods traffic is carried out across the Pacific towards Los Angeles and Long Beach. In contrast to the sea routes, the Silk Road via the land route to Europe is on the one hand still under construction and on the other hand is much smaller in terms of scope. Intra-Asian trade, including sea trade, is growing rapidly.[91][92][93][94][95][96][97][98]\n\n\nIn 2010, Asia had 3.3 million millionaires (people with net worth over US$1 million excluding their homes), slightly below North America with 3.4 million millionaires. Last year Asia had toppled Europe.[99]\nCitigroup in The Wealth Report 2012 stated that Asian centa-millionaire overtook North America's wealth for the first time as the world's \"economic center of gravity\" continued moving east. At the end of 2011, there were 18,000 Asian people mainly in Southeast Asia, China and Japan who have at least $100 million in disposable assets, while North America with 17,000 people and Western Europe with 14,000 people.[100]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (nominal, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) China | 17,700,899 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Japan | 4,230,862 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) India | 3,732,224 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Russia | 1,862,470 | 2023\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) South Korea | 1,709,232 | 2021\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Indonesia | 1,417,387 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Turkey | 1,154,600 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | 1,069,437 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Taiwan | 751,930 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Israel | 521,688 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country\n | GDP (PPP, Peak Year)millions of USD | Peak Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) China | 32,897,929 | 2023\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) India | 13,119,622 | 2023\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Japan | 6,495,214 | 2023\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Russia[101] | 5,326,855 | 2022\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Indonesia | 4,393,370 | 2023\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Turkey | 3,613,540 | 2023\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) South Korea | 2,924,189 | 2023\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | 2,246,535 | 2023\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Egypt | 1,809,425 | 2023\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Iran | 1,725,874 | 2023\n |\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![A Thai temple complex with several ornate buildings, and a lot of visitors](image)Wat Phra Kaew in the Grand Palace is among Bangkok's major tourist attractions.\nSee also the categories Tourism in Asia and Transport in Asia\n\nWith growing Regional Tourism with domination of Chinese visitors, MasterCard has released Global Destination Cities Index 2013 with 10 of 20 are dominated by Asia and Pacific Region Cities and also for the first time a city of a country from Asia (Bangkok) set in the top-ranked with 15.98 million international visitors.[102]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Asia\n\nSee also: List of Asian countries by population and List of Asian countries by life expectancy\n\n\n\nHistorical populations| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1500  | 243,000,000 | —     |\n| 1700  | 436,000,000 | +0.29% |\n| 1900  | 947,000,000 | +0.39% |\n| 1950  | 1,402,000,000 | +0.79% |\n| 1999  | 3,634,000,000 | +1.96% |\n| 2016 | 4,462,676,731 | +1.22% |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since\n1970, is the only country on the \"Top 10 Movers\" list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region's top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy.[103]\n  \nNepal, a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world's fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements. Its present life expectancy is 25 years longer than in the 1970s. More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago.[103]\n  \n Hong Kong ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 7 in the world, which is in the \"very high human development\" category), followed by Singapore (9), Japan (19) and South Korea (22). Afghanistan (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.[103]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Asia\n\nAsia is home to several language families and many language isolates. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to Ethnologue, more than 700 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 400 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.\n\n\n\n### Religions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eastern philosophy, Religion in Asia, and List of Asian mythologies\n\nMany of the world's major religions have their origins in Asia, including the five most practiced in the world (excluding irreligion), which are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion (classified as Confucianism and Taoism), and Buddhism respectively. Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the Great Flood for example, as presented to Jews in the Hebrew Bible in the narrative of Noah—and later to Christians in the Old Testament, and to Muslims in the Quran—is earliest found in Mesopotamian mythology, in the Enûma Eliš and *Epic of Gilgamesh*. Hindu mythology similarly tells about an avatar of Vishnu in the form of a fish who warned Manu of a terrible flood. Ancient Chinese mythology also tells of a Great Flood spanning generations, one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control.\n\n\n\n#### Abrahamic[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Christianity in Asia and Islam in Asia\n\n![](image)The Western Wall and the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem\n![](image)The Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem\n![](image)Pilgrims in the annual Hajj at the Kaabah in Mecca\nThe Abrahamic religions including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Druze faith,[104] and Baháʼí Faith originated in West Asia.[105][106]\n\n\nJudaism, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in Israel, the indigenous homeland and historical birthplace of the Hebrew nation: which today consists both of those Jews who remained in the Middle East and those who returned from diaspora in Europe, North America, and other regions;[107] though various diaspora communities persist worldwide. Jews are the predominant ethnic group in Israel (75.6%) numbering at about 6.1 million,[108] although the levels of adherence to Jewish religion vary. Outside of Israel there are small ancient Jewish communities in Turkey (17,400),[109] Azerbaijan (9,100),[110] Iran (8,756),[111] India (5,000) and Uzbekistan (4,000),[112] among many other places. In total, there are 14.4–17.5 million (2016, est.)[113] Jews alive in the world today, making them one of the smallest Asian minorities, at roughly 0.3 to 0.4 percent of the total population of the continent.\n\n\nChristianity is a widespread religion in Asia with more than 286 million adherents according to Pew Research Center in 2010,[114] and nearly 364 million according to Britannica Book of the Year 2014.[115] Constituting around 12.6% of the total population of Asia. In the Philippines and East Timor, Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion;[116] it was introduced by the Spaniards and the Portuguese, respectively. In Armenia and Georgia, Eastern Orthodoxy is the predominant religion.[116] In the Middle East, such as in the Levant, Anatolia and Fars, Syriac Christianity (Church of the East) and Oriental Orthodoxy are prevalent minority denominations,[117] which are both Eastern Christian sects mainly adhered to Assyrian people or Syriac Christians. Vibrant indigenous minorities in West Asia are adhering to the Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodoxy.[116] Saint Thomas Christians in India trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century.[118] Significant Christian communities also found in Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia.[116]\n\n\nIslam, which originated in the Hejaz located in modern-day Saudi Arabia, is the second largest and most widely-spread religion in Asia with at least 1 billion Muslims constituting around 23.8% of the total population of Asia.[119] With 12.7% of the world Muslim population, the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is Indonesia, followed by Pakistan (11.5%), India (10%), Bangladesh, Iran and Turkey. Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are the three holiest cities for Islam in all the world. The Hajj and Umrah attract large numbers of Muslim devotees from all over the world to Mecca and Medina. Iran is the largest Shi'a country.\n\n\nThe Druze Faith or Druzism originated in West Asia, is a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of figures like Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, and Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. The number of Druze people worldwide is around one million, with about 45% to 50% live in Syria, 35% to 40% live in Lebanon, and less than 10% live in Israel, with recently there has been a growing Druze diaspora.[120]\n\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh. Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because Baháʼí activities in many Muslim countries has been severely suppressed by authorities. Lotus Temple is a big Baháʼí Temple in India.\n\n\n\n#### Indian and East Asian religions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Swaminarayan Akshardham Temple in Delhi, according to the Guinness World Records, is the *World's Largest Comprehensive Hindu Temple*.[121]\nAlmost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. Indian philosophy includes Hindu philosophy and Buddhist philosophy. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, Cārvāka, preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, Confucianism, Taoism and Zen Buddhism took shape.\n\n\nAs of 2012[update], Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bali, Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hindu-Buddhist temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, the largest religious monument in the world\nBuddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia. Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of Cambodia (96%),[122] Thailand (95%),[123] Burma (80–89%),[124] Japan (36–96%),[125] Bhutan (75–84%),[126] Sri Lanka (70%),[127] Laos (60–67%)[128] and Mongolia (53–93%).[129] Taiwan (35–93%),[130][131][132][133] South Korea (23–50%),[134] Malaysia (19–21%),[135] Nepal (9–11%),[136] Vietnam (10–75%),[137] China (20–50%),[138] North Korea (2–14%),[139][140][141] and small communities in India and Bangladesh. The Communist-governed countries of China, Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist, thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be under-reported.\n\n\nJainism is found mainly in India and in overseas Indian communities such as the United States and Malaysia. Sikhism is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia, especially Southeast Asia. Confucianism is found predominantly in Mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations. Taoism is found mainly in Mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. In many Chinese communities, Taoism is easily syncretized with Mahayana Buddhism, thus exact religious statistics are difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.\n\n\n\n* ![Japanese wedding at the Meiji Shrine](image)\n\nJapanese wedding at the Meiji Shrine\n* ![Hindu festival celebrated by Singapore's Tamil community](image)\n\nHindu festival celebrated by Singapore's Tamil community\n* ![Bar mitzvah at the Western Wall in Jerusalem](image)\n\nBar mitzvah at the Western Wall in Jerusalem\n* ![Catholic procession of the Black Nazarene in Manila](image)\n\nCatholic procession of the Black Nazarene in Manila\n* ![Druze dignitaries celebrating the Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu'ayb festival at the tomb of the prophet in Hittin](image)\n\nDruze dignitaries celebrating the Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu'ayb festival at the tomb of the prophet in Hittin\n* ![Christian Armenians praying at the Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat](image)\n\nChristian Armenians praying at the Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat\n* ![Muslim men praying at the Ortaköy Mosque in Istanbul](image)\n\nMuslim men praying at the Ortaköy Mosque in Istanbul\n* ![Buddhist Monks performing traditional Sand mandala made from coloured sand](image)\n\nBuddhist Monks performing traditional Sand mandala made from coloured sand\n\n\n## Modern conflicts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A refugee special train in Ambala, Punjab during the partition of India in 1947\n![](image)US forces drop Napalm on suspected Viet Cong positions in 1965.\n![](image)Wounded civilians arrive at a hospital in Aleppo during the Syrian Civil War, October 2012.\n![](image)Demonstrations in Hong Kong against the Extradition bill began in March 2019 and turned into continuing mass movements, drawing around 2 million protesters by June\nSome of the events pivotal in the Asia territory related to the relationship with the outside world in the post-Second World War were:\n\n\n\n* The Partition of India\n* The Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948\n* The Chinese Civil War\n* The Kashmir conflict\n* The Balochistan Conflict\n* The Naxalite–Maoist insurgency in India\n* The Korean War\n* The French Indochina War\n* The Vietnam War\n* The Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation\n* The 1959 Tibetan uprising\n* The Sino-Vietnamese War\n* The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971\n* The Bangladesh Liberation War\n* The Yom Kippur War\n* The Indo-Pakistani war of 1965\n* The Xinjiang conflict\n* The Iranian Revolution\n* The Soviet–Afghan War\n* The Iran–Iraq War\n* The Cambodian Killing Fields\n* The Insurgency in Laos\n* The Lebanese Civil War\n* The Sri Lankan Civil War\n* The 1988 Maldives coup d'état\n* The Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n* The Gulf War\n* The Nepalese Civil War\n* The Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts\n* The West Papua conflict\n* The First Nagorno-Karabakh War\n* The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests\n* The Indonesian occupation of East Timor\n* The Kargil War\n* The 1999 Pakistani coup d'état\n* The War in Afghanistan\n* The Iraq War\n* The South Thailand insurgency\n* The 2006 Thai coup d'état\n* The Burmese Civil War\n* The Saffron Revolution\n* The Kurdish–Turkish conflict\n* The Arab Spring\n* The Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n* The Arab–Israeli conflict\n* The Syrian Civil War\n* The Sino-Indian War\n* The 2014 Thai coup d'état\n* The Moro conflict in the Philippines\n* The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n* The Turkish invasion of Syria\n* The Rohingya crisis in Myanmar\n* The Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen\n* The Hong Kong protests\n* The 2020 China–India skirmishes\n* The Sino-Indian border dispute\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Asia\n\nThe culture of Asia is a diverse blend of customs and traditions that have been practiced by the various ethnic groups of the continent for centuries. The continent is divided into six geographic sub-regions: Central Asia, East Asia, North Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Asia.[142] These regions are defined by their cultural similarities, including common religions, languages, and ethnicities. West Asia, also known as Southwest Asia or the Middle East, has cultural roots in the ancient civilizations of the Fertile Crescent and Mesopotamia, which gave rise to the Persian, Arab, Ottoman empires, as well as the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.[143] These civilizations, which are located in the Hilly flanks, are among the oldest in the world, with evidence of farming dating back to around 9000 BCE.[144] Despite the challenges posed by the vast size of the continent and the presence of natural barriers such as deserts and mountain ranges, trade and commerce have helped to create a Pan-Asian culture that is shared across the region.[145]\n\n\n\n### Nobel prizes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Indian polymath Rabindranath Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, and became Asia's first Nobel laureate.\nThe polymath Rabindranath Tagore, a Bengali poet, dramatist, and writer from Santiniketan, now in West Bengal, India, became in 1913 the first Asian Nobel laureate. He won his Nobel Prize in Literature for notable impact his prose works and poetic thought had on English, French, and other national literatures of Europe and the Americas. He is also the writer of the national anthems of Bangladesh and India.\n\n\nOther Asian writers who won Nobel Prize for literature include Yasunari Kawabata (Japan, 1968), Kenzaburō Ōe (Japan, 1994), Gao Xingjian (China, 2000), Orhan Pamuk (Turkey, 2006), and Mo Yan (China, 2012). Some may consider the American writer, Pearl S. Buck, an honorary Asian Nobel laureate, having spent considerable time in China as the daughter of missionaries, and based many of her novels, namely *The Good Earth* (1931) and *The Mother* (1933), as well as the biographies of her parents for their time in China, *The Exile* and *Fighting Angel*, all of which earned her the Literature prize in 1938.\n\n\nAlso, Mother Teresa of India and Shirin Ebadi of Iran were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their significant and pioneering efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children. Ebadi is the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to receive the prize. Another Nobel Peace Prize winner is Aung San Suu Kyi from Burma for her peaceful and non-violent struggle under a military dictatorship in Burma. She is a nonviolent pro-democracy activist and leader of the National League for Democracy in Burma (Myanmar) and a noted prisoner of conscience. She is a Buddhist and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for \"his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China\" on 8 October 2010. He is the first Chinese citizen to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China. In 2014, Kailash Satyarthi from India and Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \"for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education\".\n\n\nSir C.V. Raman is the first Asian to get a Nobel prize in Sciences. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him\".\n\n\nJapan has won the most Nobel Prizes of any Asian nation with 24 followed by India which has won 13.\n\n\nAmartya Sen, (born 3 November 1933) is an Indian economist who was awarded the 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his contributions to welfare economics and social choice theory, and for his interest in the problems of society's poorest members.\n\n\nOther Asian Nobel Prize winners include Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Abdus Salam, Malala Yousafzai, Robert Aumann, Menachem Begin, Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko, Daniel Kahneman, Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, Ada Yonath, Yasser Arafat, José Ramos-Horta and Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo of Timor Leste, Kim Dae-jung, and 13 Japanese scientists. Most of the said awardees are from Japan and Israel except for Chandrasekhar and Raman (India), Abdus Salam and Malala Yousafzai, (Pakistan), Arafat (Palestinian Territories), Kim (South Korea), and Horta and Belo (Timor Leste).\n\n\nIn 2006, Dr. Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for the establishment of Grameen Bank, a community development bank that lends money to poor people, especially women in Bangladesh. Dr. Yunus received his PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University, United States. He is internationally known for the concept of micro credit which allows poor and destitute people with little or no collateral to borrow money. The borrowers typically pay back money within the specified period and the incidence of default is very low.\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama has received approximately eighty-four awards over his spiritual and political career.[146] On 22 June 2006, he became one of only four people ever to be recognized with Honorary Citizenship by the Governor General of Canada. On 28 May 2005, he received the Christmas Humphreys Award from the Buddhist Society in the United Kingdom. Most notable was the Nobel Peace Prize, presented in Oslo, Norway on 10 December 1989.\n\n\n\n## Political geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Asia\n\nSee also: List of sovereign states and

They share the same culture and speak the Dhivehi language. They are principally an Indo-Aryan people, closely related to the Sinhalese and having traces of Middle Eastern, South Asian, Austronesian and African genes in the population.\n\n\nIn the past there was also a small Tamil population known as the Giraavaru people. This group have now been almost completely absorbed into the larger Maldivian society but were once native to the island of Giraavaru (Kaafu Atoll). This island was evacuated in 1968 due to heavy erosion of the island.\n\n\nFilipinos in the Maldives numbering 3,000 in 2018.\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Maldives\n\nDhivehi, an Indo-Aryan language closely related to the Sinhala language of Sri Lanka, and written in a specialized Arabic script (Thaana), is the official language and is spoken by virtually the whole population. English is also spoken as a second language by many.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Islam in Maldives\n\nSunni Islam is the state religion. Historically, the Maldives were converted to Islam from Buddhism in the 12th century. \nUnder the 2008 constitution Islam is the official religion of the entire population, as adherence to it is required for citizenship.\n\n\n\n## CIA World Factbook demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n301,475 (July 2000 est.) - 369,031 (July 2007 est.)[11]\n\n\n\n### Age structure[edit]\n\n\n* 0–14 years: 22.3% (male 45,038/female 43,291)\n* 15–64 years: 73.8% (male 180,874/female 171,703)\n* 65 years and over: 3.9% (male 7,711/female 7,717) (2010 est.)\n\n\n### Sex ratio[edit]\n\n\n* *at birth:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n* *under 15 years:* 1.06 male(s)/female\n* *15-64 years:* 1.04 male(s)/female\n* *65 years and over:* 1.09 male(s)/female\n* *total population:* 1.05 male(s)/female (2000 est.)\n\n\n### Nationality[edit]\n\n\n* *noun:* Maldivian(s)\n* *adjective:* Maldivian\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\n* *definition:* age 15 and over can read and write\n* *total population:* 96.3%\n* *male:* 96.2%\n* *female:* 96.4% (2000 census)\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nThe average Maldivian citizen has 4.7 years of education[12]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Maldives Population census (2022) - Maldives Bureau of Statistics\".\n2. **^** World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision Archived 6 May 2011 at the Wayback Machine\n3. **^** \"Department of National Planning, Republic of Maldives - Offline\". *planning.gov.mv*.

They share the same culture and speak the Dhivehi language. They are principally an Indo-Aryan people, closely related to the Sinhalese and having traces of Middle Eastern, South Asian, Austronesian and African genes in the population.\n\n\nIn the past there was also a small Tamil population known as the Giraavaru people.

The remaining 1.45 million people living in Singapore are classed as non-residents, a group consisting mainly of foreign students and individuals on work passes.\n\n\nSingapore is a multiracial, multiethnic, and multicultural Asian society. Major religions include Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Taoism, and Hinduism. Its people are broadly organised under the CMIO (Chinese–Malay–Indian–Other) system of categorisation. Although Malays are recognised as the indigenous community,[3][4][5][6] 75.9% of the citizens and permanent resident visa holders are ethnic Chinese, with ethnic Malays and Indians comprising 15.0% and 7.5% respectively. Together, the three largest ethnic groups comprise 98.4% of the citizen population.[7] The remaining 1.6% comprises members of \"Other\" races, which comprises largely Eurasians. Despite long term occupancy, Singapore excludes 29% of the population as non-residents for the purpose of resident statistics.[7] Officially, mixed-race Singaporeans are often regarded as having the race of their father. However, race categorisation, for example on an individual's identity card, may also reflect both ethnicities of their parents.[8]\n\n\nThere are four official languages in Singapore – English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil. Malay is the symbolic national language, while English is the main working language.[9] Education in Singapore is bilingual, with English being the medium of instruction. Students are also required to learn a second language, usually Malay, Mandarin, or Tamil.[10][11] Singlish, a local creole and accent, is often used in colloquial speech between all native races of Singapore. There is also Singdarin, a Mandarin creole.\n\n\nThe annual total population growth rate for the year 2020 was -0.3%.[12][13] Singapore's resident total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.10 in 2020; the Singaporean Chinese, Malay and Indian fertility rates were 0.94, 1.83 and 0.97 respectively.[14] In 2018, the Singaporean Malay fertility rate was about 85% higher than that of Singaporean Chinese and Singaporean Indians, while approximately 70% higher in 2010.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Population growth[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Population growth and immigration in selected periods**[16]\n| Period\n | Population increase\n | Natural increase\n | Net immigration\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1881–1891\n | 43,857\n | −30,932A | 74,798\n |\n| 1901–1911\n | 75,729\n | −59,978A | 135,707\n |\n| 1921–1931\n | 230,387\n | 18,176\n | 212,211\n |\n| 1947–1957\n | 507,800\n | 395,600\n | 112,200\n |\n| 1970–1980\n | 339,400\n | 315,400\n | 24,000\n |\n| 1990–2000\n | 980,755\n | 325,887\n | 654,868\n |\n| 2000–2010\n | 1,048,845\n | 224,718\n | 824,127\n |\n| 2010–2020\n | 609,075\n | 203,643\n | 405,432\n |\n| * **^A** Negative figures are due to low birth rate and high death rate\n |\n\n\nSee also: Immigration to Singapore\n\nPopulation growth in Singapore was for a long period fueled by immigration, starting soon after Stamford Raffles landed in Singapore in 1819, when the population of the island was estimated to be around 1,000.[17] The first official census taken in January 1824 showed that the resident population of Singapore had grown to 10,683: 4,580 Malays, 3,317 Chinese, 1,925 Bugis, 756 natives of India, 74 Europeans, 16 Armenians, and 15 Arabs.[18] Chinese males greatly outnumbered the females; in the 1826 population figures there were 5,747 Chinese males but only 341 Chinese females, in contrast to 2,501 Malay males and 2,289 Malay females. The figures for around a thousand Indians in 1826 are also similarly skewed towards male – 209 male and 35 female Bengalis, 772 males and 5 females from the Coromandel Coast.[19] By 1836, the population figure had risen to 29,980, and marked a change in demographics as the Malays were outnumbered for the first time; 45.9% of the population were Chinese versus 41.9% for Malays (including Javanese and Bugis).[20][21] Women from China were discouraged from emigrating, and most of the Chinese females in this early period of Singapore were likely *nyonyas* from Malacca; it was noted in 1837 that there were no Chinese women in Singapore who had emigrated directly from China.[21]\n\n\nThe imbalance of the sexes continued for a long period, for example, the 1901 census figures show that there were 130,367 Chinese males compared to 33,674 Chinese females.[22] Such imbalance also meant that fewer people were born in early Singapore, and in the first hundred years, most of the Chinese population in Singapore were immigrants. By the late 1890s, only around 10% of the Chinese population in Singapore were born there.[23] Many of the early migrant workers from China and India did not intend to settle permanently to raise their families in Singapore; they worked to send back remittance to their families back home, and would return to China or India after they had earned enough money. Later an increasing number of Chinese chose to settle permanently in Singapore, especially in the 1920s when it became more favourable to stay in Singapore rather than returning to China. Change in social attitude in the modern era also meant that Chinese women were freer to emigrate from China, and the sex ratio began to normalise.[21] This gradual normalisation of sex ratio led to an increase in the number of native births. Immigration continued to be the main reason for the Chinese population increase in Singapore until the 1931–1947 period when the natural increase in population surpassed the net immigration figure.[23][24]\n\n\nAfter World War II, in the period from 1947 to 1957, Singapore saw a massive population increase mostly due to increased number of native births.[25] The birth rate rose and the death rate fell; the average annual growth rate was 4.4%, of which 1% was due to immigration; Singapore experienced its highest birth rate in 1957 at 42.7 per thousand individuals. (This was also the same year the United States saw its peak birth rate.)\n\n\nImmigration to Singapore also fell sharply after Singapore independence due to tighter control of immigration from Malaysia and other countries. The population increase became dominated by native births with 315,400 in the 1970–1980 period due to natural increase compared to 24,000 from net migration. However, a lower rate of natural growth in population and the need for low-skill labour resulted in a deliberate shift in policy by the Singapore government to allow more foreigners to live and work in the country, and net migration increased in the 1980–1990 period to nearly 200,000. By the decade of 1990–2000, the net migrant number of over 600,000 had surpassed the natural growth of the population, and accounted for nearly two-thirds of the population increase. The same high level of immigration is also seen in the next decade with 664,083 net migration recorded.[16]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Net migration rate\n | 9.12 migrants/1,000 population (2006 est.)\n |\n\n\nDue to the continued low birth rate, amongst other reasons, the Singapore government has varied its immigration policy over the years. As the demand for labour grew with industrialisation, foreign talent with professional qualifications as well as less-skilled foreign workers has made up a significant and increasing proportion of Singapore's total population since the 2000s and 2010s. Curbs on immigration, however, began to be implemented in the 2010s to ease increasing social issues arising from the high level of immigration.[26]\n\n\n\n### Population planning[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Population planning in Singapore\n\n\n\nPer-period population growth, 1947—2000[25]\n| Period | Growth rate\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1947—1957 | 84.7%\n |\n| 1957—1970 | 90.8%\n |\n| 1970—1980 | 13.3%\n |\n| 1980—1990 | 18.5%\n |\n| 1990— 2000 | 20.6%\n |\n\n\nThe post-war boom in births led to an interest in family planning, and by 1960, the government publicly funded and supported family planning programmes. After independence in 1965, the birth rate had fallen to 29.5 per thousand individuals, and the natural growth rate had fallen to 2.5%. Birth rates in the 1960s were still perceived as high by the government; on average, a baby was born every 11 minutes in 1965. Kandang Kerbau Hospital (KKH)—which specialised in women's health and was the most popular hospital to have children—saw over 100 deliveries per day in 1962. In 1966, KKH delivered 39835 babies, earning it a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for \"largest number of births in a single maternity facility\" for ten years. Because there was generally a massive shortage of beds in that era, mothers with routine deliveries were discharged from hospitals within 24 hours.[27]\n\n\nIn September 1965 the Minister for Health, Yong Nyuk Lin, submitted a white paper to Parliament, recommending a \"Five-year Mass Family Planning programme\" that would reduce the birth rate to 20.0 per thousand individuals by 1970. In 1966, the Family Planning and Population Board (FPPB) had been established based on the findings of the white paper, providing clinical services and public education on family planning.[28]\n\n\nBy 1970, the *Stop at Two* campaign was firmly established, implementing incentives, disincentives and public exhortation to discourage families from having more than two children. After 1975, the fertility rate declined below replacement level, in a sign that Singapore was undergoing the demographic transition. In 1983, the *Graduate Mothers' Scheme* was implemented in an attempt to get educated women, especially women with a university degree, to marry and procreate, while the government encouraged women without an O-level degree to get sterilised. This was done out of the Lee Kuan Yew government's belief that for the nation to best develop and avoid hardship, the educated classes should be encouraged to contribute to the nation's breeding pool, while the uneducated should not, sparking the *Great Marriage Debate*.[28]\n\n\nIn 1986, the government reversed its population policy—except its stance on low-income, lowly-educated women—and initiated the Have Three or More (if you can afford it) campaign, offering cash and public administration incentives to have children. In 2001, the Singapore government started its Baby Bonus scheme.\n\n\nSingapore has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world.[29] In 2012, Singapore total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.20 children born per woman, a sub-replacement fertility rate. Ethnic Chinese had a fertility of 1.07 in 2004 (1.65 in 1990), while Malays had a TFR of 2.10 (2.69 in 1990). Both figures declined further in 2006. TFR for Indians was 1.30 in 2004 and 1.89 in 1990.[30] The Singapore government has launched several highly publicised attempts to raise the fertility rate and increase awareness of the negative effects of an ageing population, the elderly (65 and above) had constituted 9.9% of its population in 2012; this proportion is still significantly lower than that of many other developed nations, such as the United States and Japan. In February 2015, National University of Singapore launched the \"New Age Institute\" in conjunction with Washington University in St. Louis to conduct research on this issue.[31]\n\n\n\n### Area planning[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Planning areas of Singapore and New towns of Singapore\n\nThe population of Singapore are generally housed within new towns, which are large scale satellite housing developments designed to be self contained. It includes public housing units, private housing, a town centre and other amenities.[32] Since the 1950s, Singapore had a city centre surrounded by slums and squatter colonies. By 1959 when Singapore attained self government, the problem of housing shortage had grown. Combined with a fast population growth, it led to congestion and squalor.[33] The new towns planning concept was introduced in July 1952 by the country's public housing authority, Housing and Development Board (HDB), to counter the housing shortage problem and to relocate most of the population crammed within the city centre to other parts of the island.[34][35] Today, there are 23 new towns and 3 estates within the country, with Bedok being the largest by area and population.[36]\n\n\n\n### Population white paper[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Population White Paper\n\nIn early 2013, the Parliament of Singapore debated over the policies recommended by the Population White Paper entitled *A Sustainable Population for a Dynamic Singapore*. Citing that Singapore's 900,000 Baby Boomers would comprise a quarter of the citizen population by 2030 and that its workforce would shrink \"from 2020 onwards\", the White Paper projected that by 2030, Singapore's \"total population could range between 6.5 and 6.9 million\", with resident population between 4.2 and 4.4 million and citizen population between 3.6 and 3.8 million. The White Paper called for an increase in the number of foreign workers so as to provide balance between the number of skilled and less-skilled workers, as well as provide healthcare and domestic services. It also claimed that foreign workers help businesses thrive when the economy is good.[37] The motion was passed[38] albeit after amendments made to leave out \"population policy\" and add focus on infrastructure and transport development.\n\n\nThe White Paper was heavily criticised and panned by opposition parties and government critics.[39] Member of Parliament Low Thia Khiang of the Workers' Party of Singapore had criticised current measures of increasing the fertility rate, claiming that this would lead to an increase of a higher cost of living and discourage young couples from having more kids. As for current immigration policies, he had noted that immigrants were a source of friction for Singaporeans and that an increased population would put more stress and strain on the urban infrastructure.[40] On 16 February 2013, nearly 3,000 people rallied to protest against the White Paper at Hong Lim Park and raised concerns that the increased population would lead to the deterioration of public service and the increase of the cost of living.[41]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Population size and growth by residential status[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

the post-independence period, the population of Singapore has been categorised into four main groups: Chinese, Malays, Indians, and Others. The CMIO system was first proposed in 1956 to organise the education system of Singapore by four national languages.[49]\n\n\nAlthough population growth in Singapore was driven by immigration for a long period during the colonial period, the population increase in Singapore became dominated by native births in Singapore around the middle of the 20th century, and boomed after the Second World War. After Singapore became independent in 1965, the free movement of people between Malaysia and Singapore ended, and net immigration dropped to a low level of 24,000 in the decade of 1970–80 due to tighter control on immigration.[16] However, the fertility of the Chinese population declined sharply after the post-war boom, while that of the Malays remained high. There was therefore a corresponding percentage increase of the Malay population, which rose to 14.5% in 1967 after a long period of continual decline.[21]\n\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the policy on immigration changed; the number of immigrants increased sharply and became again an important factor in the growth of population in Singapore. By the 1990–2000 period, the number of migrants had overtaken the natural population increase, constituting nearly two-thirds of the decadal population increase with 640,571 net migrants including non-residents.[16] While the racial composition of its citizens has been fairly constant in recent years, it shows a shift in the figures for its residents (citizens plus permanent residents). Fewer of the immigrants were Malays, therefore the percentage resident population of the Malays began to fall. Indian residents, however, rose to 9.2% in 2010 due to an increase in the number of Indians migrant workers (compared to 7.4% Indians in the figures for citizens).[50]\n\n\nThe population profile of the country changed dramatically after the relaxation of immigration policy, with a huge increase in the number of transient migrant workers. Official figures show that the number of foreigners on short-term permits (termed 'non-residents') has grown from 30,900 in 1970 to 797,900 in 2005, which translate roughly to a 24-fold increase in 35 years, or from 1% of the population in 1970 to 18.3% in 2005. Despite this huge increase, no further breakdown is given by Singstat. By 2010, the population of non-residents had increased to 25.7%. It was estimated in the mid-2010s that around 40% of Singapore's population were of foreign origin (permanent residents plus non-residents such as foreign students and workers including dependents).[51]\n\n\n\n\n\nProportion of non-residents out of total population[52][53][7]\n|  | 1970 | 1980 | 1990 | 2000 | 2009 | 2014 | 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Non-residents (residents = citizens + PRs)\n | 2.9%\n | 5.5%\n | 10.2%\n | 18.7%\n | 25.3%\n | 29.3%\n | 28.9%\n |\n\n\nWhile the Singapore Department of Statistics reports overall population figures for Singapore (4.48 million in 2006), as a matter of policy, it only provides more detailed demographic breakdown analysis for the approximately 80% of the population (in 2006) who are Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents (collectively termed 'residents').

Other estimates place the then population of Singapore at 1,000, belonging to various local tribes.[17] Early census figures show a long influx of migrant workers into the country, initially comprising mostly Malays, but shortly thereafter followed by the Chinese. By 1821, the population was estimated to have increased to 4,724 Malays and 1,150 Chinese.[59]\n\n\nIn the first census of 1824, 6,505 out of the 10,683 total were Malays and Bugis, constituting over 60% of the population. Large number of Chinese migrants started to enter Singapore just months after it became a British settlement, and they were predominantly male. In 1826, official census figures give a total population of 13,750, with 6,088 Chinese, 4,790 Malays, 1,242 Bugis, 1,021 Indians from Bengal (244) and the Coromandel Coast (777), smaller number of Javanese (267), Europeans (87) and other peoples.[19] The population total of Singapore increased to 16,000 in 1829, 26,000 five years later. By 1836, the Chinese at 13,749 had become the most populous ethnic group, overtaking the broad Malay grouping (12,538, including other groups such as the Bugis, Javanese, and Balinese from the Dutch East Indies).[60] By 1849, the population had reached 59,043, 24,790 of them Chinese.[61]\n\n\nMany of the migrants from China in the 19th century came to work on the pepper and gambier plantations, with 11,000 Chinese immigrants recorded in one year.[62] Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements, many of whom then settled in Singapore after their contract ended. By 1860, the total population had reached around 90,000, of these 50,000 were Chinese, and 2,445 Europeans and Eurasians. The first thorough census in Singapore was undertaken in 1871, and the people were grouped into 33 racial, ethnic or national categories, with Chinese forming the largest group at 57.6%.[63]\n\n\nCensuses were then conducted at 10-year intervals afterwards. The 1881 census grouped the people into 6 main categories, and further subdivided into 47 sub-categories. The 6 broad groups were given as Europeans, Eurasians, Malays, Chinese, Indians and Others in 1921.[49] The Malays group included other natives of the Malay archipelago, the Europeans included Americans, the Indians would be people from the Indian subcontinent including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh. In 1901, the total population of Singapore was 228,555,[62] with 15.8% Malays, 71.8% Chinese, 7.8% Indians, and 3.5% Europeans and Eurasians. The Chinese population figure of Singapore has stayed at over 70% of the total since, reaching 77.8% in 1947. After dropping from a peak of 60% in the early years of Singapore, the Malay population settled within the range of 11 and 16% in the first half of the 20th century, while Indians hovered between 7 and just over 9% in the same period.[60]\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation of colonial era Singapore\n| Ethnic group\n | PopulationA |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1824[64] | 1826[19] | 1836[20] | 1871[65] | 1901[65] | 1931[65][66] | 1957[67] |\n| Europeans\n | 74\n | 87\n | 141\n | 1,946\n | 3,824\n | 8,082\n | 10,826\n |\n| Eurasians |  |  | 117\n | 2,164\n | 4,120\n | 6,903\n | 11,382\n |\n| Native ChristiansB |  | 188\n | 421\n |  |  |  |  |\n| Armenians | 16\n | 19\n | 34\n |  |  | (81)\n |  |\n| Arabs | 15\n | 26\n | 41\n |  |  |  |  |\n| MalaysC | 4,580\n | 4,790\n | 9,632\n | 26,148\n | 36,080\n | 65,014\n | 197,059\n |\n| Bugis\n | 1,925\n | 1,242\n | 1,962D |  |  |  |  |\n| Javanese\n |  | 267\n | 903\n |  |  |  |  |\n| Chinese | 3,317\n | 6,088\n | 13,749\n | 54,572\n | 164,041\n | 418,640\n | 1,090,596\n |\n| Indians | 756\n | 1,021\n | 2,930\n | 11,610\n | 17,824\n | 50,811\n | 124,084\n |\n| OthersE |  | 12\n | 50\n | 671\n | 2,667\n | 8,275\n | 11,982\n |\n| Total\n | 10,683\n | 13,750\n | 29,980\n | 97,111\n | 228,555\n | 557,745\n | 1,445,929\n |\n\n\n* **^A** Population figures do not include transient populations of military personnel and convicts\n* **^B** Mostly of Portuguese descent\n* **^C** Include other peoples of the Malay Archipelago if figures not given separately\n* **^D** Include Balinese\n* **^E** Include Cafres, Siamese, Parsis, Jews, and other groupings if figures not given separately.\n\n\n\n\nAnnual growth rate for main ethnic groups in selected periods[24]\n| Ethnic group\n | 1824–1830 | 1849–1860 | 1881–1891 | 1901–1911 | 1931–1947\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chinese | 12.0% | 5.4% | 3.5% | 3.0% | 3.5%\n |\n| Malays | 2.9% | 5.2% | 0.1% | 1.5% | 3.6%\n |\n| Indians | 6.7% | 6.8% | 2.9% | 5.0% | 1.9%\n |\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Quadrilingual construction warning sign written in Singapore's four official languages; English, Chinese, Tamil and Malay.\nMain article: Languages of Singapore\n\n| Languages of Singapore (2020)[68] |\n| --- |\n| Languages |  | percent |\n| English |  | 48.3% |\n| Mandarin Chinese |  | 29.9% |\n| Malay |  | 9.2% |\n| Chinese dialects |  | 8.7% |\n| Tamil |  | 2.5% |\n| Others |  | 1.4% |\n\nSingapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil.\n\n\nMalay is the national language of the country, although English is the official language used in the educational system and by the government.

The use of other Chinese varieties, like Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese and Hakka, has been declining over the last two decades, although they are still being used especially by the older generations of the Chinese population.\n\n\nAbout 60% of Indian Singaporeans are Tamils although the percentage of those who speak Tamil at home has been declining, with around 37% of Singaporean Indians speaking Tamil at home according to the 2010 census.[69] Other spoken Indian languages are Punjabi, Malayalam, Hindi and Bengali, but none of them alone is spoken by more than 10% of the Indian Singaporeans. As with Chinese Singaporean, a large proportion of Indian Singaporeans speak English at home.[70] However, despite long term occupancy, Singapore excludes 29% of the population as non-residents for the purpose of resident statistics.\n\n\nAround 5,000 to 10,000 Peranakans, the early Chinese population of the region, still use the Hokkien-influenced Malay dialect called Baba Malay.\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages of Singapore Most Frequently Spoken at Home\n|  | 1980\n | 1990\n | 2000\n | 2010\n | 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English\n | 11.6%\n | 20.3%\n | 23.0%\n | 32.3%\n | 48.3%\n |\n| Mandarin Chinese\n | 10.2%\n | 26.0%\n | 35.0%\n | 35.6%\n | 29.9%\n |\n| Malay\n | 13.9%\n | 13.4%\n | 14.1%\n | 12.2%\n | 9.2%\n |\n| Chinese dialects\n | 59.5%\n | 36.7%\n | 23.8%\n | 14.3%\n | 8.7%\n |\n| Tamil\n | 3.1%\n | 2.9%\n | 3.2%\n | 3.3%\n | 2.5%\n |\n| Others\n | 1.7%\n | 0.7%\n | 0.9%\n | 2.3%\n | 1.4%\n |\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Singapore\n\nReligion in Singapore (census 2020)[71][72][73]\n\n\n\nBuddhism (31.1%)\nNo religion (20.0%)\nIslam (15.6%)\nProtestantism and other Christians (11.9%)\nTaoism and other Chinese religions (8.8%)\nCatholicism (7.0%)\nHinduism (5.0%)\nSikhism and other religions (0.6%)\n\nThe main religions of Singapore are Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Christianity, and Hinduism, with a significant number who profess no religion.[74][75]\n\n\nSingapore has freedom of religion, although the government restricts some religions such as Jehovah's Witnesses, due to their opposition to conscription. The majority of Malays are Muslim, while the plurality of Chinese practise Buddhism and syncretic Chinese folk traditions. Christianity is growing in the country. Taoism was overtaken as the second-most important religion in the 2000 census among the Chinese as more have increasingly described themselves as Buddhists rather than Taoist.[75] Indians are mostly Hindus though many are Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians. People who practise no religion form the third-largest group in Singapore.[76]\n\n\n\n## Marriage and divorce[edit]\n\n\n\n\nMarriages and divorces[46][77]\n|  | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Number of marriages** (excluding previously married)\n | 24,596 | 26,081 | 24,363 | 27,258 | 27,936 | 26,254 | 28,407\n |\n| **Number of divorces** (not including divorces under Muslim law)\n | 5,170 | 5,416 | 5,433 | 5,696 | 5,306 | 5,471 | 5,172 | 5,450 | 5,505 | 5,570\n |\n| **Median age of first marriage** (years)\n |\n| ...Grooms\n | 29.8 | 29.8 | 30.0 | 30.1 | 30.1 | 30.1 | 30.2\n |\n| ...Brides\n | 27.3 | 27.5 | 27.7 | 28.0 | 28.0 | 28.1 | 28.2\n |\n| **General marriage rate** |\n| ...Males (per 1,000 unmarried resident males aged 15 to 49)\n | 43.5 | 43.4 | 39.3 | 43.5 | 43.8 | 40.5 | 44.4\n |\n| ...Females (per 1,000 unmarried resident females aged 15 to 49)\n | 39.6 | 38.9 | 35.3 | 39.2 | 39.4 | 36.9 | 40.8\n |\n| **Median age at divorce** (years)\n |\n| ...Grooms\n | 39.9 | 40.5 | 41.0 | 41.3 | 41.6 | 42.4 | 42.6\n |\n| ...Brides\n | 36.3 | 36.9 | 37.4 | 37.7 | 38.0 | 38.2 | 38.4\n |\n| **General divorce rate** |\n| ...Males (per 1,000 married resident males aged 20 years and over)\n | 7.5 | 7.5 | 7.5 | 7.6 | 7.1 | 7.3 | 7.0\n |\n| ...Females (per 1,000 married resident females aged 20 years and over)\n | 7.3 | 7.1 | 7.2 | 7.2 | 6.7 | 6.9 | 6.5\n |\n| **Crude marriage rate** (per 1,000 resident population)\n |  |  |  | 6.7 |  |  |  |\n| **Crude rate of marital dissolution** (per 1,000 resident population)\n |  |  |  | 2.0 |  |  |  |\n\n\n## Literacy and education[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLiteracy rate population aged 15 years and above[78]\n| Year\n | 1960\n | 1970\n | 1980 | 1990 | 2000 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013\n | 2014\n | 2015\n | 2016\n | 2017\n | 2018\n | 2019\n | 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total\n | 52.6%\n | 68.9%\n | 82.3% | 89.1% | 92.5% | 95.9% | 96.2% | 96.4% | 96.6%\n | 96.7%\n | 96.8%\n | 97.0%\n | 97.2%\n | 97.3%\n | 97.5%\n | 97.1%\n |\n| Male\n | 70.3%\n | 83.0%\n | 91.4% | 95.1% | 96.6% | 98.0% | 98.4% | 98.5% | 98.5%\n | 98.6%\n | 98.6%\n | 98.7%\n | 98.8%\n | 98.9%\n | 98.9%\n | 98.5%\n |\n| Female\n | 32.8%\n | 54.3%\n | 73.1% | 83.0% | 88.6% | 93.8% | 94.1% | 94.4% | 94.7%\n | 94.9%\n | 95.2%\n | 95.4%\n | 95.7%\n | 95.9%\n | 96.1%\n | 95.8%\n |\n\n\n\n\nHighest qualification attained of resident non-student population aged 25 years and over[45]\n| Highest qualification attained | 2001 | 2011\n | 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Below secondary | 46.9% | 33.4%\n | 25.5%\n |\n| Secondary | 24.1% | 19.6%\n | 16.3%\n |\n| Post-secondary (non-tertiary) | 6.6% | 8.9%\n | 10.0%\n |\n| Diploma or professional qualification | 8.9% | 13.6%\n | 15.3%\n |\n| University | 13.6% | 24.5%\n | 33.0%\n |\n\n\nAmong residents aged 25–39 years, the percentage of university graduates increased from 23.7% in 2001 to 45.9% in 2011 while that who had attained a diploma or professional qualification increased from 15.9% to 22.9% over the same period.[45]\n\n\n\n## Employment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, the unemployment rate for persons aged 15 years and over was 2.5%, the lowest in the last four years, with a labour force of 2.3 million people.[79][80][81]\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment (thousands)[82]\n| Year | Employment *change* | Employment in December 2012\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012\n |\n| Total | −22.9 | −12.9 | 71.4 | 113.3 | 176.0 | 234.9 | 221.6 | 37.6 | 115.9 | 122.6 | 129.1 | 3,357.6\n |\n| Total (excluding foreign domestic workers) | −23.6 | −11.7 | 66.4 | 105.5 | 168.0 | 223.5 | 213.4 | 32.9 | 110.6 | 117.7 | 125.8 | 3,148.0\n |\n| Locals | 19.4 | 14.9 | 49.9 | 63.5 | 90.9 | 90.4 | 64.7 | 41.8 | 56.2 | 37.9 | 58.7 | 2,089.3\n |\n| Foreigners | −42.3 | −27.9 | 21.5 | 49.8 | 85.1 | 144.5 | 156.9 | −4.2 | 59.7 | 84.8 | 70.4 | 1,268.3\n |\n| Foreigners (excluding foreign domestic workers) | −43.0 | −26.6 | 16.5 | 42.0 | 77.1 | 133.1 | 148.7 | −8.9 | 54.4 | 79.8 | 67.1 | 1,058.7\n |\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment rate (%) for persons aged 15 years and over[83][82]\n| Year | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Overall | 3.6 | 4.0 | 3.4 | 3.1 | 2.7 | 2.1 | 2.2 | 3.0 | 2.2 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0\n |\n| Residents | 4.8 | 5.2 | 4.4 | 4.1 | 3.6 | 3.0 | 3.2 | 4.3 | 3.1 | 2.9 | 2.8 |  |  |\n| Singapore citizens | 5.1 | 5.4 | 4.8 | 4.4 | 3.7 | 3.1 | 3.4 | 4.5 | 3.4 | 3.0 | 3.0 |  |  |\n\n\n## Household income[edit]\n\n\n### Average household monthly income[edit]\n\n\nThe average household monthly income was SGD 4,943 in 2000, which was an increase of $3,080 in 1990 at an average annual rate of 4.9%.

decile[edit]\n\n\nWith the recovery from the 1998 economic slowdown, household income growth had resumed for the majority of households in 2000. However, for the lowest two deciles, the average household income in 2000 had declined compared with 1999. This was mainly due to the increase in the proportion of households with no income earner from 75% in 1999 to 87% in 2000 for the lowest 10%. Households with no income earner include those with retired elderly persons as well as unemployed members.[88]\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage monthly household income from work *including* employer CPF

The remaining 1.45 million people living in Singapore are classed as non-residents, a group consisting mainly of foreign students and individuals on work passes.\n\n\nSingapore is a multiracial, multiethnic, and multicultural Asian society. Major religions include Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Taoism, and Hinduism. Its people are broadly organised under the CMIO (Chinese–Malay–Indian–Other) system of categorisation. Although Malays are recognised as the indigenous community,[3][4][5][6] 75.9% of the citizens and permanent resident visa holders are ethnic Chinese, with ethnic Malays and Indians comprising 15.0% and 7.5% respectively. Together, the three largest ethnic groups comprise 98.4% of the citizen population.[7] The remaining 1.6% comprises members of \"Other\" races, which comprises largely Eurasians. Despite long term occupancy, Singapore excludes 29% of the population as non-residents for the purpose of resident statistics.[7] Officially, mixed-race Singaporeans are often regarded as having the race of their father. However, race categorisation, for example on an individual's identity card, may also reflect both ethnicities of their parents.[8]\n\n\nThere are four official languages in Singapore – English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil. Malay is the symbolic national language, while English is the main working language.[9] Education in Singapore is bilingual, with English being the medium of instruction. Students are also required to learn a second language, usually Malay, Mandarin, or Tamil.[10][11] Singlish, a local creole and accent, is often used in colloquial speech between all native races of Singapore. There is also Singdarin, a Mandarin creole.\n\n\nThe annual total population growth rate for the year 2020 was -0.3%.[12][13] Singapore's resident total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.10 in 2020; the Singaporean Chinese, Malay and Indian fertility rates were 0.94, 1.83 and 0.97 respectively.[14] In 2018, the Singaporean Malay fertility rate was about 85% higher than that of Singaporean Chinese and Singaporean Indians, while approximately 70% higher in 2010.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Population growth[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Population growth and immigration in selected periods**[16]\n| Period\n | Population increase\n | Natural increase\n | Net immigration\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1881–1891\n | 43,857\n | −30,932A | 74,798\n |\n| 1901–1911\n | 75,729\n | −59,978A | 135,707\n |\n| 1921–1931\n | 230,387\n | 18,176\n | 212,211\n |\n| 1947–1957\n | 507,800\n | 395,600\n | 112,200\n |\n| 1970–1980\n | 339,400\n | 315,400\n | 24,000\n |\n| 1990–2000\n | 980,755\n | 325,887\n | 654,868\n |\n| 2000–2010\n | 1,048,845\n | 224,718\n | 824,127\n |\n| 2010–2020\n | 609,075\n | 203,643\n | 405,432\n |\n| * **^A** Negative figures are due to low birth rate and high death rate\n |\n\n\nSee also: Immigration to Singapore\n\nPopulation growth in Singapore was for a long period fueled by immigration, starting soon after Stamford Raffles landed in Singapore in 1819, when the population of the island was estimated to be around 1,000.[17] The first official census taken in January 1824 showed that the resident population of Singapore had grown to 10,683: 4,580 Malays, 3,317 Chinese, 1,925 Bugis, 756 natives of India, 74 Europeans, 16 Armenians, and 15 Arabs.[18] Chinese males greatly outnumbered the females; in the 1826 population figures there were 5,747 Chinese males but only 341 Chinese females, in contrast to 2,501 Malay males and 2,289 Malay females. The figures for around a thousand Indians in 1826 are also similarly skewed towards male – 209 male and 35 female Bengalis, 772 males and 5 females from the Coromandel Coast.[19] By 1836, the population figure had risen to 29,980, and marked a change in demographics as the Malays were outnumbered for the first time; 45.9% of the population were Chinese versus 41.9% for Malays (including Javanese and Bugis).[20][21] Women from China were discouraged from emigrating, and most of the Chinese females in this early period of Singapore were likely *nyonyas* from Malacca; it was noted in 1837 that there were no Chinese women in Singapore who had emigrated directly from China.[21]\n\n\nThe imbalance of the sexes continued for a long period, for example, the 1901 census figures show that there were 130,367 Chinese males compared to 33,674 Chinese females.[22] Such imbalance also meant that fewer people were born in early Singapore, and in the first hundred years, most of the Chinese population in Singapore were immigrants. By the late 1890s, only around 10% of the Chinese population in Singapore were born there.[23] Many of the early migrant workers from China and India did not intend to settle permanently to raise their families in Singapore; they worked to send back remittance to their families back home, and would return to China or India after they had earned enough money. Later an increasing number of Chinese chose to settle permanently in Singapore, especially in the 1920s when it became more favourable to stay in Singapore rather than returning to China. Change in social attitude in the modern era also meant that Chinese women were freer to emigrate from China, and the sex ratio began to normalise.[21] This gradual normalisation of sex ratio led to an increase in the number of native births. Immigration continued to be the main reason for the Chinese population increase in Singapore until the 1931–1947 period when the natural increase in population surpassed the net immigration figure.[23][24]\n\n\nAfter World War II, in the period from 1947 to 1957, Singapore saw a massive population increase mostly due to increased number of native births.[25] The birth rate rose and the death rate fell; the average annual growth rate was 4.4%, of which 1% was due to immigration; Singapore experienced its highest birth rate in 1957 at 42.7 per thousand individuals. (This was also the same year the United States saw its peak birth rate.)\n\n\nImmigration to Singapore also fell sharply after Singapore independence due to tighter control of immigration from Malaysia and other countries. The population increase became dominated by native births with 315,400 in the 1970–1980 period due to natural increase compared to 24,000 from net migration. However, a lower rate of natural growth in population and the need for low-skill labour resulted in a deliberate shift in policy by the Singapore government to allow more foreigners to live and work in the country, and net migration increased in the 1980–1990 period to nearly 200,000. By the decade of 1990–2000, the net migrant number of over 600,000 had surpassed the natural growth of the population, and accounted for nearly two-thirds of the population increase. The same high level of immigration is also seen in the next decade with 664,083 net migration recorded.[16]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Net migration rate\n | 9.12 migrants/1,000 population (2006 est.)\n |\n\n\nDue to the continued low birth rate, amongst other reasons, the Singapore government has varied its immigration policy over the years. As the demand for labour grew with industrialisation, foreign talent with professional qualifications as well as less-skilled foreign workers has made up a significant and increasing proportion of Singapore's total population since the 2000s and 2010s. Curbs on immigration, however, began to be implemented in the 2010s to ease increasing social issues arising from the high level of immigration.[26]\n\n\n\n### Population planning[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Population planning in Singapore\n\n\n\nPer-period population growth, 1947—2000[25]\n| Period | Growth rate\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1947—1957 | 84.7%\n |\n| 1957—1970 | 90.8%\n |\n| 1970—1980 | 13.3%\n |\n| 1980—1990 | 18.5%\n |\n| 1990— 2000 | 20.6%\n |\n\n\nThe post-war boom in births led to an interest in family planning, and by 1960, the government publicly funded and supported family planning programmes. After independence in 1965, the birth rate had fallen to 29.5 per thousand individuals, and the natural growth rate had fallen to 2.5%. Birth rates in the 1960s were still perceived as high by the government; on average, a baby was born every 11 minutes in 1965. Kandang Kerbau Hospital (KKH)—which specialised in women's health and was the most popular hospital to have children—saw over 100 deliveries per day in 1962. In 1966, KKH delivered 39835 babies, earning it a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for \"largest number of births in a single maternity facility\" for ten years. Because there was generally a massive shortage of beds in that era, mothers with routine deliveries were discharged from hospitals within 24 hours.[27]\n\n\nIn September 1965 the Minister for Health, Yong Nyuk Lin, submitted a white paper to Parliament, recommending a \"Five-year Mass Family Planning programme\" that would reduce the birth rate to 20.0 per thousand individuals by 1970. In 1966, the Family Planning and Population Board (FPPB) had been established based on the findings of the white paper, providing clinical services and public education on family planning.[28]\n\n\nBy 1970, the *Stop at Two* campaign was firmly established, implementing incentives, disincentives and public exhortation to discourage families from having more than two children. After 1975, the fertility rate declined below replacement level, in a sign that Singapore was undergoing the demographic transition. In 1983, the *Graduate Mothers' Scheme* was implemented in an attempt to get educated women, especially women with a university degree, to marry and procreate, while the government encouraged women without an O-level degree to get sterilised. This was done out of the Lee Kuan Yew government's belief that for the nation to best develop and avoid hardship, the educated classes should be encouraged to contribute to the nation's breeding pool, while the uneducated should not, sparking the *Great Marriage Debate*.[28]\n\n\nIn 1986, the government reversed its population policy—except its stance on low-income, lowly-educated women—and initiated the Have Three or More (if you can afford it) campaign, offering cash and public administration incentives to have children. In 2001, the Singapore government started its Baby Bonus scheme.\n\n\nSingapore has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world.[29] In 2012, Singapore total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.20 children born per woman, a sub-replacement fertility rate. Ethnic Chinese had a fertility of 1.07 in 2004 (1.65 in 1990), while Malays had a TFR of 2.10 (2.69 in 1990). Both figures declined further in 2006. TFR for Indians was 1.30 in 2004 and 1.89 in 1990.[30] The Singapore government has launched several highly publicised attempts to raise the fertility rate and increase awareness of the negative effects of an ageing population, the elderly (65 and above) had constituted 9.9% of its population in 2012; this proportion is still significantly lower than that of many other developed nations, such as the United States and Japan. In February 2015, National University of Singapore launched the \"New Age Institute\" in conjunction with Washington University in St. Louis to conduct research on this issue.[31]\n\n\n\n### Area planning[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Planning areas of Singapore and New towns of Singapore\n\nThe population of Singapore are generally housed within new towns, which are large scale satellite housing developments designed to be self contained. It includes public housing units, private housing, a town centre and other amenities.[32] Since the 1950s, Singapore had a city centre surrounded by slums and squatter colonies. By 1959 when Singapore attained self government, the problem of housing shortage had grown. Combined with a fast population growth, it led to congestion and squalor.[33] The new towns planning concept was introduced in July 1952 by the country's public housing authority, Housing and Development Board (HDB), to counter the housing shortage problem and to relocate most of the population crammed within the city centre to other parts of the island.[34][35] Today, there are 23 new towns and 3 estates within the country, with Bedok being the largest by area and population.[36]\n\n\n\n### Population white paper[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Population White Paper\n\nIn early 2013, the Parliament of Singapore debated over the policies recommended by the Population White Paper entitled *A Sustainable Population for a Dynamic Singapore*. Citing that Singapore's 900,000 Baby Boomers would comprise a quarter of the citizen population by 2030 and that its workforce would shrink \"from 2020 onwards\", the White Paper projected that by 2030, Singapore's \"total population could range between 6.5 and 6.9 million\", with resident population between 4.2 and 4.4 million and citizen population between 3.6 and 3.8 million. The White Paper called for an increase in the number of foreign workers so as to provide balance between the number of skilled and less-skilled workers, as well as provide healthcare and domestic services. It also claimed that foreign workers help businesses thrive when the economy is good.[37] The motion was passed[38] albeit after amendments made to leave out \"population policy\" and add focus on infrastructure and transport development.\n\n\nThe White Paper was heavily criticised and panned by opposition parties and government critics.[39] Member of Parliament Low Thia Khiang of the Workers' Party of Singapore had criticised current measures of increasing the fertility rate, claiming that this would lead to an increase of a higher cost of living and discourage young couples from having more kids. As for current immigration policies, he had noted that immigrants were a source of friction for Singaporeans and that an increased population would put more stress and strain on the urban infrastructure.[40] On 16 February 2013, nearly 3,000 people rallied to protest against the White Paper at Hong Lim Park and raised concerns that the increased population would lead to the deterioration of public service and the increase of the cost of living.[41]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Population size and growth by residential status[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

the post-independence period, the population of Singapore has been categorised into four main groups: Chinese, Malays, Indians, and Others. The CMIO system was first proposed in 1956 to organise the education system of Singapore by four national languages.[49]\n\n\nAlthough population growth in Singapore was driven by immigration for a long period during the colonial period, the population increase in Singapore became dominated by native births in Singapore around the middle of the 20th century, and boomed after the Second World War. After Singapore became independent in 1965, the free movement of people between Malaysia and Singapore ended, and net immigration dropped to a low level of 24,000 in the decade of 1970–80 due to tighter control on immigration.[16] However, the fertility of the Chinese population declined sharply after the post-war boom, while that of the Malays remained high. There was therefore a corresponding percentage increase of the Malay population, which rose to 14.5% in 1967 after a long period of continual decline.[21]\n\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the policy on immigration changed; the number of immigrants increased sharply and became again an important factor in the growth of population in Singapore. By the 1990–2000 period, the number of migrants had overtaken the natural population increase, constituting nearly two-thirds of the decadal population increase with 640,571 net migrants including non-residents.[16] While the racial composition of its citizens has been fairly constant in recent years, it shows a shift in the figures for its residents (citizens plus permanent residents). Fewer of the immigrants were Malays, therefore the percentage resident population of the Malays began to fall. Indian residents, however, rose to 9.2% in 2010 due to an increase in the number of Indians migrant workers (compared to 7.4% Indians in the figures for citizens).[50]\n\n\nThe population profile of the country changed dramatically after the relaxation of immigration policy, with a huge increase in the number of transient migrant workers. Official figures show that the number of foreigners on short-term permits (termed 'non-residents') has grown from 30,900 in 1970 to 797,900 in 2005, which translate roughly to a 24-fold increase in 35 years, or from 1% of the population in 1970 to 18.3% in 2005. Despite this huge increase, no further breakdown is given by Singstat. By 2010, the population of non-residents had increased to 25.7%. It was estimated in the mid-2010s that around 40% of Singapore's population were of foreign origin (permanent residents plus non-residents such as foreign students and workers including dependents).[51]\n\n\n\n\n\nProportion of non-residents out of total population[52][53][7]\n|  | 1970 | 1980 | 1990 | 2000 | 2009 | 2014 | 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Non-residents (residents = citizens + PRs)\n | 2.9%\n | 5.5%\n | 10.2%\n | 18.7%\n | 25.3%\n | 29.3%\n | 28.9%\n |\n\n\nWhile the Singapore Department of Statistics reports overall population figures for Singapore (4.48 million in 2006), as a matter of policy, it only provides more detailed demographic breakdown analysis for the approximately 80% of the population (in 2006) who are Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents (collectively termed 'residents'). Of this group of about 3.6 million people in 2006, Chinese form 75.2%, Malays form 13.6%, Indians form 8.8%, while Eurasians and other groups form 2.4%. No breakdown by ethnicity is released for the non-resident population.

Other estimates place the then population of Singapore at 1,000, belonging to various local tribes.[17] Early census figures show a long influx of migrant workers into the country, initially comprising mostly Malays, but shortly thereafter followed by the Chinese. By 1821, the population was estimated to have increased to 4,724 Malays and 1,150 Chinese.[59]\n\n\nIn the first census of 1824, 6,505 out of the 10,683 total were Malays and Bugis, constituting over 60% of the population. Large number of Chinese migrants started to enter Singapore just months after it became a British settlement, and they were predominantly male. In 1826, official census figures give a total population of 13,750, with 6,088 Chinese, 4,790 Malays, 1,242 Bugis, 1,021 Indians from Bengal (244) and the Coromandel Coast (777), smaller number of Javanese (267), Europeans (87) and other peoples.[19] The population total of Singapore increased to 16,000 in 1829, 26,000 five years later. By 1836, the Chinese at 13,749 had become the most populous ethnic group, overtaking the broad Malay grouping (12,538, including other groups such as the Bugis, Javanese, and Balinese from the Dutch East Indies).[60] By 1849, the population had reached 59,043, 24,790 of them Chinese.[61]\n\n\nMany of the migrants from China in the 19th century came to work on the pepper and gambier plantations, with 11,000 Chinese immigrants recorded in one year.[62] Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements, many of whom then settled in Singapore after their contract ended. By 1860, the total population had reached around 90,000, of these 50,000 were Chinese, and 2,445 Europeans and Eurasians. The first thorough census in Singapore was undertaken in 1871, and the people were grouped into 33 racial, ethnic or national categories, with Chinese forming the largest group at 57.6%.[63]\n\n\nCensuses were then conducted at 10-year intervals afterwards. The 1881 census grouped the people into 6 main categories, and further subdivided into 47 sub-categories. The 6 broad groups were given as Europeans, Eurasians, Malays, Chinese, Indians and Others in 1921.[49] The Malays group included other natives of the Malay archipelago, the Europeans included Americans, the Indians would be people from the Indian subcontinent including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh. In 1901, the total population of Singapore was 228,555,[62] with 15.8% Malays, 71.8% Chinese, 7.8% Indians, and 3.5% Europeans and Eurasians. The Chinese population figure of Singapore has stayed at over 70% of the total since, reaching 77.8% in 1947. After dropping from a peak of 60% in the early years of Singapore, the Malay population settled within the range of 11 and 16% in the first half of the 20th century, while Indians hovered between 7 and just over 9% in the same period.[60]\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation of colonial era Singapore\n| Ethnic group\n | PopulationA |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1824[64] | 1826[19] | 1836[20] | 1871[65] | 1901[65] | 1931[65][66] | 1957[67] |\n| Europeans\n | 74\n | 87\n | 141\n | 1,946\n | 3,824\n | 8,082\n | 10,826\n |\n| Eurasians |  |  | 117\n | 2,164\n | 4,120\n | 6,903\n | 11,382\n |\n| Native ChristiansB |  | 188\n | 421\n |  |  |  |  |\n| Armenians | 16\n | 19\n | 34\n |  |  | (81)\n |  |\n| Arabs | 15\n | 26\n | 41\n |  |  |  |  |\n| MalaysC | 4,580\n | 4,790\n | 9,632\n | 26,148\n | 36,080\n | 65,014\n | 197,059\n |\n| Bugis\n | 1,925\n | 1,242\n | 1,962D |  |  |  |  |\n| Javanese\n |  | 267\n | 903\n |  |  |  |  |\n| Chinese | 3,317\n | 6,088\n | 13,749\n | 54,572\n | 164,041\n | 418,640\n | 1,090,596\n |\n| Indians | 756\n | 1,021\n | 2,930\n | 11,610\n | 17,824\n | 50,811\n | 124,084\n |\n| OthersE |  | 12\n | 50\n | 671\n | 2,667\n | 8,275\n | 11,982\n |\n| Total\n | 10,683\n | 13,750\n | 29,980\n | 97,111\n | 228,555\n | 557,745\n | 1,445,929\n |\n\n\n* **^A** Population figures do not include transient populations of military personnel and convicts\n* **^B** Mostly of Portuguese descent\n* **^C** Include other peoples of the Malay Archipelago if figures not given separately\n* **^D** Include Balinese\n* **^E** Include Cafres, Siamese, Parsis, Jews, and other groupings if figures not given separately.\n\n\n\n\nAnnual growth rate for main ethnic groups in selected periods[24]\n| Ethnic group\n | 1824–1830 | 1849–1860 | 1881–1891 | 1901–1911 | 1931–1947\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chinese | 12.0% | 5.4% | 3.5% | 3.0% | 3.5%\n |\n| Malays | 2.9% | 5.2% | 0.1% | 1.5% | 3.6%\n |\n| Indians | 6.7% | 6.8% | 2.9% | 5.0% | 1.9%\n |\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Quadrilingual construction warning sign written in Singapore's four official languages; English, Chinese, Tamil and Malay.\nMain article: Languages of Singapore\n\n| Languages of Singapore (2020)[68] |\n| --- |\n| Languages |  | percent |\n| English |  | 48.3% |\n| Mandarin Chinese |  | 29.9% |\n| Malay |  | 9.2% |\n| Chinese dialects |  | 8.7% |\n| Tamil |  | 2.5% |\n| Others |  | 1.4% |\n\nSingapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil.\n\n\nMalay is the national language of the country, although English is the official language used in the educational system and by the government. The colloquial English-based creole used in everyday life is often referred to as Singlish, spoken by all races of Singapore.\n\n\nThe government of Singapore promotes the use of Mandarin. The use of other Chinese varieties, like Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese and Hakka, has been declining over the last two decades, although they are still being used especially by the older generations of the Chinese population.\n\n\nAbout 60% of Indian Singaporeans are Tamils although the percentage of those who speak Tamil at home has been declining, with around 37% of Singaporean Indians speaking Tamil at home according to the 2010 census.[69] Other spoken Indian languages are Punjabi, Malayalam, Hindi and Bengali, but none of them alone is spoken by more than 10% of the Indian Singaporeans. As with Chinese Singaporean, a large proportion of Indian Singaporeans speak English at home.[70] However, despite long term occupancy, Singapore excludes 29% of the population as non-residents for the purpose of resident statistics.\n\n\nAround 5,000 to 10,000 Peranakans, the early Chinese population of the region, still use the Hokkien-influenced Malay dialect called Baba Malay.\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages of Singapore Most Frequently Spoken at Home\n|  | 1980\n | 1990\n | 2000\n | 2010\n | 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English\n | 11.6%\n | 20.3%\n | 23.0%\n | 32.3%\n | 48.3%\n |\n| Mandarin Chinese\n | 10.2%\n | 26.0%\n | 35.0%\n | 35.6%\n | 29.9%\n |\n| Malay\n | 13.9%\n | 13.4%\n | 14.1%\n | 12.2%\n | 9.2%\n |\n| Chinese dialects\n | 59.5%\n | 36.7%\n | 23.8%\n | 14.3%\n | 8.7%\n |\n| Tamil\n | 3.1%\n | 2.9%\n | 3.2%\n | 3.3%\n | 2.5%\n |\n| Others\n | 1.7%\n | 0.7%\n | 0.9%\n | 2.3%\n | 1.4%\n |\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Singapore\n\nReligion in Singapore (census 2020)[71][72][73]\n\n\n\nBuddhism (31.1%)\nNo religion (20.0%)\nIslam (15.6%)\nProtestantism and other Christians (11.9%)\nTaoism and other Chinese religions (8.8%)\nCatholicism (7.0%)\nHinduism (5.0%)\nSikhism and other religions (0.6%)\n\nThe main religions of Singapore are Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Christianity, and Hinduism, with a significant number who profess no religion.[74][75]\n\n\nSingapore has freedom of religion, although the government restricts some religions such as Jehovah's Witnesses, due to their opposition to conscription. The majority of Malays are Muslim, while the plurality of Chinese practise Buddhism and syncretic Chinese folk traditions. Christianity is growing in the country. Taoism was overtaken as the second-most important religion in the 2000 census among the Chinese as more have increasingly described themselves as Buddhists rather than Taoist.[75] Indians are mostly Hindus though many are Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians. People who practise no religion form the third-largest group in Singapore.[76]\n\n\n\n## Marriage and divorce[edit]\n\n\n\n\nMarriages and divorces[46][77]\n|  | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Number of marriages** (excluding previously married)\n | 24,596 | 26,081 | 24,363 | 27,258 | 27,936 | 26,254 | 28,407\n |\n| **Number of divorces** (not including divorces under Muslim law)\n | 5,170 | 5,416 | 5,433 | 5,696 | 5,306 | 5,471 | 5,172 | 5,450 | 5,505 | 5,570\n |\n| **Median age of first marriage** (years)\n |\n| ...Grooms\n | 29.8 | 29.8 | 30.0 | 30.1 | 30.1 | 30.1 | 30.2\n |\n| ...Brides\n | 27.3 | 27.5 | 27.7 | 28.0 | 28.0 | 28.1 | 28.2\n |\n| **General marriage rate** |\n| ...Males (per 1,000 unmarried resident males aged 15 to 49)\n | 43.5 | 43.4 | 39.3 | 43.5 | 43.8 | 40.5 | 44.4\n |\n| ...Females (per 1,000 unmarried resident females aged 15 to 49)\n | 39.6 | 38.9 | 35.3 | 39.2 | 39.4 | 36.9 | 40.8\n |\n| **Median age at divorce** (years)\n |\n| ...Grooms\n | 39.9 | 40.5 | 41.0 | 41.3 | 41.6 | 42.4 | 42.6\n |\n| ...Brides\n | 36.3 | 36.9 | 37.4 | 37.7 | 38.0 | 38.2 | 38.4\n |\n| **General divorce rate** |\n| ...Males (per 1,000 married resident males aged 20 years and over)\n | 7.5 | 7.5 | 7.5 | 7.6 | 7.1 | 7.3 | 7.0\n |\n| ...Females (per 1,000 married resident females aged 20 years and over)\n | 7.3 | 7.1 | 7.2 | 7.2 | 6.7 | 6.9 | 6.5\n |\n| **Crude marriage rate** (per 1,000 resident population)\n |  |  |  | 6.7 |  |  |  |\n| **Crude rate of marital dissolution** (per 1,000 resident population)\n |  |  |  | 2.0 |  |  |  |\n\n\n## Literacy and education[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLiteracy rate population aged 15 years and above[78]\n| Year\n | 1960\n | 1970\n | 1980 | 1990 | 2000 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013\n | 2014\n | 2015\n | 2016\n | 2017\n | 2018\n | 2019\n | 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total\n | 52.6%\n | 68.9%\n | 82.3% | 89.1% | 92.5% | 95.9% | 96.2% | 96.4% | 96.6%\n | 96.7%\n | 96.8%\n | 97.0%\n | 97.2%\n | 97.3%\n | 97.5%\n | 97.1%\n |\n| Male\n | 70.3%\n | 83.0%\n | 91.4% | 95.1% | 96.6% | 98.0% | 98.4% | 98.5% | 98.5%\n | 98.6%\n | 98.6%\n | 98.7%\n | 98.8%\n | 98.9%\n | 98.9%\n | 98.5%\n |\n| Female\n | 32.8%\n | 54.3%\n | 73.1% | 83.0% | 88.6% | 93.8% | 94.1% | 94.4% | 94.7%\n | 94.9%\n | 95.2%\n | 95.4%\n | 95.7%\n | 95.9%\n | 96.1%\n | 95.8%\n |\n\n\n\n\nHighest qualification attained of resident non-student population aged 25 years and over[45]\n| Highest qualification attained | 2001 | 2011\n | 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Below secondary | 46.9% | 33.4%\n | 25.5%\n |\n| Secondary | 24.1% | 19.6%\n | 16.3%\n |\n| Post-secondary (non-tertiary) | 6.6% | 8.9%\n | 10.0%\n |\n| Diploma or professional qualification | 8.9% | 13.6%\n | 15.3%\n |\n| University | 13.6% | 24.5%\n | 33.0%\n |\n\n\nAmong residents aged 25–39 years, the percentage of university graduates increased from 23.7% in 2001 to 45.9% in 2011 while that who had attained a diploma or professional qualification increased from 15.9% to 22.9% over the same period.[45]\n\n\n\n## Employment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, the unemployment rate for persons aged 15 years and over was 2.5%, the lowest in the last four years, with a labour force of 2.3 million people.[79][80][81]\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment (thousands)[82]\n| Year | Employment *change* | Employment in December 2012\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012\n |\n| Total | −22.9 | −12.9 | 71.4 | 113.3 | 176.0 | 234.9 | 221.6 | 37.6 | 115.9 | 122.6 | 129.1 | 3,357.6\n |\n| Total (excluding foreign domestic workers) | −23.6 | −11.7 | 66.4 | 105.5 | 168.0 | 223.5 | 213.4 | 32.9 | 110.6 | 117.7 | 125.8 | 3,148.0\n |\n| Locals | 19.4 | 14.9 | 49.9 | 63.5 | 90.9 | 90.4 | 64.7 | 41.8 | 56.2 | 37.9 | 58.7 | 2,089.3\n |\n| Foreigners | −42.3 | −27.9 | 21.5 | 49.8 | 85.1 | 144.5 | 156.9 | −4.2 | 59.7 | 84.8 | 70.4 | 1,268.3\n |\n| Foreigners (excluding foreign domestic workers) | −43.0 | −26.6 | 16.5 | 42.0 | 77.1 | 133.1 | 148.7 | −8.9 | 54.4 | 79.8 | 67.1 | 1,058.7\n |\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment rate (%) for persons aged 15 years and over[83][82]\n| Year | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Overall | 3.6 | 4.0 | 3.4 | 3.1 | 2.7 | 2.1 | 2.2 | 3.0 | 2.2 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 2.0\n |\n| Residents | 4.8 | 5.2 | 4.4 | 4.1 | 3.6 | 3.0 | 3.2 | 4.3 | 3.1 | 2.9 | 2.8 |  |  |\n| Singapore citizens | 5.1 | 5.4 | 4.8 | 4.4 | 3.7 | 3.1 | 3.4 | 4.5 | 3.4 | 3.0 | 3.0 |  |  |\n\n\n## Household income[edit]\n\n\n### Average household monthly income[edit]\n\n\nThe average household monthly income was SGD 4,943 in 2000, which was an increase of $3,080 in 1990 at an average annual rate of 4.9%.

decile[edit]\n\n\nWith the recovery from the 1998 economic slowdown, household income growth had resumed for the majority of households in 2000. However, for the lowest two deciles, the average household income in 2000 had declined compared with 1999. This was mainly due to the increase in the proportion of households with no income earner from 75% in 1999 to 87% in 2000 for the lowest 10%. Households with no income earner include those with retired elderly persons as well as unemployed members.[88]\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage monthly household income from work *including* employer CPF

Bahrain, but in 2022, the country was approximately 12%[21] Christian and had about 40[22][23] Jewish citizens.\n\n\nAccording to the website of Ministry of Information Affairs, 74% of the population are Muslim, with Christians being the second largest religious group, forming 10.2% of the population, Jews making up 0.21%. The percentage of local Bahraini Christians, Jews, Hindus and Baha’is is collectively 0.2%.[24][10]\n\n\nBahraini citizens of Muslim faith belong to the Shi'a and Sunni branches of Islam. The last official census (1941) to include sectarian identification reported 52% (88,298 citizens) as Shia and 48% as Sunni of the Muslim population.[25] Unofficial sources, such as the Library of Congress Country Studies,[26] and *The New York Times*,[27] estimate sectarian identification to be approximately 45% Sunni and 55% Shia. An official Bahraini document revealed that 51% of the country's citizens are Sunnis, while the Shiite population has declined to 49% of the Muslim population.[28]\n\n\nForeigners, overwhelmingly from South Asia and other Arab countries, constituted 52.6% of the population in 2020.[10] Of these, 50.9% are Muslim and 49.1% are non-Muslim,[10] including Christians (primarily: Catholic, Protestant, Syriac Orthodox, and Mar Thoma from South India), Hindus, Buddhists, Baháʼís, and Sikhs.\n\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nArabic\nEnglish\nPersian\nKurdish\nMalayalam\nUrdu\nBalochi\nKonkani\nHindi\nSinhalese\nTamil\nPunjabi\nBengali\nArmenian\nFilipino\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Bahranis\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Middle East: Bahrain\".

Bahrain, but in 2022, the country was approximately 12%[21] Christian and had about 40[22][23] Jewish citizens.\n\n\nAccording to the website of Ministry of Information Affairs, 74% of the population are Muslim, with Christians being the second largest religious group, forming 10.2% of the population, Jews making up 0.21%. The percentage of local Bahraini Christians, Jews, Hindus and Baha’is is collectively 0.2%.[24][10]\n\n\nBahraini citizens of Muslim faith belong to the Shi'a and Sunni branches of Islam. The last official census (1941) to include sectarian identification reported 52% (88,298 citizens) as Shia and 48% as Sunni of the Muslim population.[25] Unofficial sources, such as the Library of Congress Country Studies,[26] and *The New York Times*,[27] estimate sectarian identification to be approximately 45% Sunni and 55% Shia. An official Bahraini document revealed that 51% of the country's citizens are Sunnis, while the Shiite population has declined to 49% of the Muslim population.[28]\n\n\nForeigners, overwhelmingly from South Asia and other Arab countries, constituted 52.6% of the population in 2020.[10] Of these, 50.9% are Muslim and 49.1% are non-Muslim,[10] including Christians (primarily: Catholic, Protestant, Syriac Orthodox, and Mar Thoma from South India), Hindus, Buddhists, Baháʼís, and Sikhs.\n\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nArabic\nEnglish\nPersian\nKurdish\nMalayalam\nUrdu\nBalochi\nKonkani\nHindi\nSinhalese\nTamil\nPunjabi\nBengali\nArmenian\nFilipino\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Bahranis\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Middle East: Bahrain\".

Like neighbouring countries, Brunei is a Malay-dominated country. Many cultural and linguistic differences make Brunei Malays distinct from the larger Malay populations in nearby Malaysia and Indonesia, even though they are ethnically related and share the Muslim religion.\n\n\nBrunei has a hereditary nobility with the title Pengiran these are, more often than not, related to the Sultan by blood. The Sultan can award to commoners the title Pehin, the equivalent of a life peerage awarded in the United Kingdom. The Sultan also can award his subjects the Dato, the equivalent of a knighthood in the United Kingdom, and Datin, the equivalent of a damehood.\n\n\nBruneians adhere to the practice of using complete full names with all titles, including the title Haji (for men) or Hajjah (for women) for those who have made the Haj pilgrimage to Mecca. Many Brunei Malay women wear the tudong, a traditional head covering. Men wear the songkok, a traditional Malay cap. Men who have completed the Haj wear a white songkok.\n\n\nThe requirements to attain Brunei citizenship include passing tests in Malay culture, customs and language. Stateless permanent residents of Brunei are given International Certificates of Identity, which allow them to travel overseas. The majority of Brunei's Chinese are permanent residents, and many are stateless.\n\n\nPetroleum wealth allows the Brunei Government to provide the population with one of Asia's finest health care systems. The Brunei Medical and Health Department introduced the region's first government \"flying doctor service\" in early 1965. Malaria has been eradicated, and cholera is virtually nonexistent. There are three general hospitals—in Bandar Seri Begawan, Tutong, and Kuala Belait—and there are numerous health clinics throughout the country.\n\n\nEducation starts with preschool, followed by 6 years of primary education and up to 6 years of secondary education. Nine years of education are mandatory. Most of Brunei's college students attend universities and other institutions abroad, but approximately 2,542 study at the University of Brunei Darussalam. Opened in 1985, the university has a faculty of over 300 instructors and is located on a sprawling campus at Tungku, overlooking the South China Sea.\n\n\nThe official language is Malay, but English is widely understood and used in business. Other languages spoken are several Chinese dialects, Iban, and a number of native dialects. Islam is the official religion, but religious freedom is guaranteed under the constitution.\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nThe UN estimates Brunei's total population as 445,373 as of 2021.\n\n\nThe CIA World Factbook estimates the population at 450,565 as of July 2018.[1]\n\n\n\n### UN estimates[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| [2] | Total population (thousands)\n | Population aged 0–14 (%)\n | Population aged

Like neighbouring countries, Brunei is a Malay-dominated country. Many cultural and linguistic differences make Brunei Malays distinct from the larger Malay populations in nearby Malaysia and Indonesia, even though they are ethnically related and share the Muslim religion.\n\n\nBrunei has a hereditary nobility with the title Pengiran these are, more often than not, related to the Sultan by blood. The Sultan can award to commoners the title Pehin, the equivalent of a life peerage awarded in the United Kingdom. The Sultan also can award his subjects the Dato, the equivalent of a knighthood in the United Kingdom, and Datin, the equivalent of a damehood.\n\n\nBruneians adhere to the practice of using complete full names with all titles, including the title Haji (for men) or Hajjah (for women) for those who have made the Haj pilgrimage to Mecca. Many Brunei Malay women wear the tudong, a traditional head covering. Men wear the songkok, a traditional Malay cap. Men who have completed the Haj wear a white songkok.\n\n\nThe requirements to attain Brunei citizenship include passing tests in Malay culture, customs and language. Stateless permanent residents of Brunei are given International Certificates of Identity, which allow them to travel overseas. The majority of Brunei's Chinese are permanent residents, and many are stateless.\n\n\nPetroleum wealth allows the Brunei Government to provide the population with one of Asia's finest health care systems. The Brunei Medical and Health Department introduced the region's first government \"flying doctor service\" in early 1965. Malaria has been eradicated, and cholera is virtually nonexistent. There are three general hospitals—in Bandar Seri Begawan, Tutong, and Kuala Belait—and there are numerous health clinics throughout the country.\n\n\nEducation starts with preschool, followed by 6 years of primary education and up to 6 years of secondary education. Nine years of education are mandatory. Most of Brunei's college students attend universities and other institutions abroad, but approximately 2,542 study at the University of Brunei Darussalam. Opened in 1985, the university has a faculty of over 300 instructors and is located on a sprawling campus at Tungku, overlooking the South China Sea.\n\n\nThe official language is Malay, but English is widely understood and used in business. Other languages spoken are several Chinese dialects, Iban, and a number of native dialects. Islam is the official religion, but religious freedom is guaranteed under the constitution.\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nThe UN estimates Brunei's total population as 445,373 as of 2021.\n\n\nThe CIA World Factbook estimates the population at 450,565 as of July 2018.[1]\n\n\n\n### UN estimates[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| [2] | Total population (thousands)\n | Population aged 0–14 (%)\n | Population aged

Israel refers to the administrative division encompassing Israeli-controlled Jewish-majority civilian areas of Area C of the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem, as Judea and Samaria Area (Hebrew: אֵזוֹר יְהוּדָה וְשׁוֹמְרוֹן, *Ezor Yehuda VeShomron*).[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Demographic map of Gaza, West Bank, Israel proper and the Golan Heights\nThe demographic statistics of *The World Factbook* and the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics estimated that the collective Palestinian Arab population in the region of Palestine, including Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, amounted to 5.79 million people in 2017.[7][8] Of these, 2.16 million Arabs live in the West Bank, 1.84 million Arabs live in Israel, and 1.79 million Arabs live in the Gaza Strip.[7][8]\n\n\nThe demographic statistics of *The World Factbook* and the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics estimated (2017) that the collective population in the Palestinian territories amounted to 4,543,126 people in 2017. Thereof, 2,155,743 Arabs live in the West Bank, 1,795,183 Arabs live in the Gaza Strip, and 391,000 Jews live in the West Bank.[8] Approximately 214,600 Jews live in East Jerusalem.[9] East Jerusalem, once administered by Jordan, came under Israeli occupation after the 1967 Six-Day War.[10] In the Palestinian territories, c. 86% of the population is Arab (predominantly Sunni), c. 13% is Jewish, other <1% (cf. Israel: Jewish 74%, Arab 21%, other 5%).[8]\n\n\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), the number of Palestinians in the Palestinian Territory was 3,935,249 in 2009, resulting in a calculated population density of 654 capita per km2, of which 433 capita/km2 in the West Bank including Jerusalem and 4,073 capita/km2 in Gaza Strip.[11] In the mid-2009, the share of population less than 15 years was 41.9% and above 65 years 3%.[11]\n\n\nAccording to the UN, the population in the State of Palestine was c. 4.9 million in 2017, resulting in an estimated population density of 817 capita per km2.[12] However, a Census held on 1 December 2017 resulted in a total of 4,781.245. The estimate of the Palestine Central Bureau of Statistics for mid 2023 showed a population total of 5,483,450.\n\n\nOut of 224 listed countries and territories, the West Bank ranked 48th with a total fertility rate (TFR) of 3.2, and the Gaza Strip ranked 31st with a TFR of 3.97 according to *The World Factbook* in 2018.[13] In 2018, the West Bank had an estimated population growth rate of 1.81% (country comparison to the world: 56th) and the Gaza Strip had a population growth rate of 2.25% (35th).[14][15][16]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Population (mid-year, millions)[17][18][19] |\n| --- |\n| Year\n |

Israel refers to the administrative division encompassing Israeli-controlled Jewish-majority civilian areas of Area C of the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem, as Judea and Samaria Area (Hebrew: אֵזוֹר יְהוּדָה וְשׁוֹמְרוֹן, *Ezor Yehuda VeShomron*).[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Demographic map of Gaza, West Bank, Israel proper and the Golan Heights\nThe demographic statistics of *The World Factbook* and the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics estimated that the collective Palestinian Arab population in the region of Palestine, including Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, amounted to 5.79 million people in 2017.[7][8] Of these, 2.16 million Arabs live in the West Bank, 1.84 million Arabs live in Israel, and 1.79 million Arabs live in the Gaza Strip.[7][8]\n\n\nThe demographic statistics of *The World Factbook* and the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics estimated (2017) that the collective population in the Palestinian territories amounted to 4,543,126 people in 2017. Thereof, 2,155,743 Arabs live in the West Bank, 1,795,183 Arabs live in the Gaza Strip, and 391,000 Jews live in the West Bank.[8] Approximately 214,600 Jews live in East Jerusalem.[9] East Jerusalem, once administered by Jordan, came under Israeli occupation after the 1967 Six-Day War.[10] In the Palestinian territories, c. 86% of the population is Arab (predominantly Sunni), c. 13% is Jewish, other <1% (cf. Israel: Jewish 74%, Arab 21%, other 5%).[8]\n\n\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), the number of Palestinians in the Palestinian Territory was 3,935,249 in 2009, resulting in a calculated population density of 654 capita per km2, of which 433 capita/km2 in the West Bank including Jerusalem and 4,073 capita/km2 in Gaza Strip.[11] In the mid-2009, the share of population less than 15 years was 41.9% and above 65 years 3%.[11]\n\n\nAccording to the UN, the population in the State of Palestine was c. 4.9 million in 2017, resulting in an estimated population density of 817 capita per km2.[12] However, a Census held on 1 December 2017 resulted in a total of 4,781.245. The estimate of the Palestine Central Bureau of Statistics for mid 2023 showed a population total of 5,483,450.\n\n\nOut of 224 listed countries and territories, the West Bank ranked 48th with a total fertility rate (TFR) of 3.2, and the Gaza Strip ranked 31st with a TFR of 3.97 according to *The World Factbook* in 2018.[13] In 2018, the West Bank had an estimated population growth rate of 1.81% (country comparison to the world: 56th) and the Gaza Strip had a population growth rate of 2.25% (35th).[14][15][16]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Population (mid-year, millions)[17][18][19] |\n| --- |\n| Year\n |
