Nations on the current year's schedule are highlighted in green, with circuit locations marked in black. Former host nations are shown in dark grey. Former host circuits are marked with a white dot. *De facto* status of territories is shown.\nFormula One, abbreviated to F1, is currently the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body.[1] The \"formula\" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and vehicles must conform.[2] The Formula One World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, usually held on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets.[3] The results of each race are combined to determine two annual championships, one for drivers (World Drivers' Championship), and one for constructors (World Constructors' Championship).[4]\n\n\nThis list is for the circuits that hosted World Championship races from 1950 until now. The terms \"Formula One race\" and \"World Championship race\" were not always synonymous throughout history – see Formula One § Distinction between Formula One and World Championship races for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Formula One |\n| --- |\n| Current season\n* 2024 Formula One World Championship\n |\n| Related articles\n* History of Formula One\n* Formula One racing\n* Formula One regulations\n* Formula One cars\n* Formula One engines\n* Formula One tyres\n |\n| Lists\n* Drivers + (GP winners\n\t+ Sprint winners\n\t+ Polesitters\n\t+ Fastest laps\n\t+ Champions\n\t+ Numbers)\n\n\n* Constructors + (GP winners\n\t+ Champions)\n\n\n* Engine manufacturers + (GP winners\n\t+ Champions)\n\n\n* + Seasons\n\t+ Grands Prix\n\t+ Circuits\n\n\n* Race Promoters' Trophy winners\n\n\n* Points scoring systems\n\n\n* + National colours\n\t+ Sponsorship liveries\n\n\n* + Racing flags\n\t+ Red-flagged races\n\n\n* + Female drivers\n\t+ TV broadcasters\n\n\n* + Fatalities\n\t+ Video games\n |\n| Records\n* Drivers\n* Constructors\n* Engines\n* Tyres\n* Races\n |\n| Organisations\n* FIA\n* FIA World Motor Sport Council\n* Formula One Group\n* Liberty Media\n* Formula One Constructors' Association\n* Formula One Teams Association\n* Grand Prix Drivers' Association\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe first World Championship Grand Prix was held in 1950 at Silverstone; since then 76 circuits in total have hosted a Grand Prix. A lot of classic (older) circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations throughout their history: Nürburgring, Spa-Francorchamps, Monza, etc. Taking Nürburgring as an example, the first World Championship race there used the 22.835 km (14.189 mi) configuration, but concerns over safety meant that more recent Grands Prix have used a shorter, safer circuit.[5] Formula One circuits were predominantly in Europe during the early years of the championship; as the sport has expanded, so has the location of its circuits. The expansion into Asia and America has been a recent occurrence. Of the 20 circuits that hosted a Grand Prix in 2012, nearly half were not on the calendar before 1999.[6] The Autodromo Nazionale Monza has hosted the most World Championship races; the only season it did not host a race was in 1980, when the Italian Grand Prix was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari.[7] The Miami International Autodrome became the 76th circuit to host a Grand Prix, when it held the Miami Grand Prix in 2022; this is the latest addition to this list. The longest circuit to have hosted a Grand Prix is the Pescara Circuit, which hosted the 1957 Pescara Grand Prix: the 25.800 km (16.031 mi) long circuit in Pescara, Italy, held the annual Coppa Acerbo race, and in 1957 it was the only time that this race was included as part of the World Championship, a race which Stirling Moss won.[8] The Las Vegas Strip Circuit is due to host its first Grand Prix in 2023, with the Las Vegas Grand Prix.[9]\n\n\nAs some circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations, the most recent configuration used is listed in the table below.\n\n\n\n##

Nations on the current year's schedule are highlighted in green, with circuit locations marked in black. Former host nations are shown in dark grey. Former host circuits are marked with a white dot. *De facto* status of territories is shown.\nFormula One, abbreviated to F1, is currently the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body.[1] The \"formula\" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and vehicles must conform.[2] The Formula One World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, usually held on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets.[3] The results of each race are combined to determine two annual championships, one for drivers (World Drivers' Championship), and one for constructors (World Constructors' Championship).[4]\n\n\nThis list is for the circuits that hosted World Championship races from 1950 until now. The terms \"Formula One race\" and \"World Championship race\" were not always synonymous throughout history – see Formula One § Distinction between Formula One and World Championship races for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Formula One |\n| --- |\n| Current season\n* 2024 Formula One World Championship\n |\n| Related articles\n* History of Formula One\n* Formula One racing\n* Formula One regulations\n* Formula One cars\n* Formula One engines\n* Formula One tyres\n |\n| Lists\n* Drivers + (GP winners\n\t+ Sprint winners\n\t+ Polesitters\n\t+ Fastest laps\n\t+ Champions\n\t+ Numbers)\n\n\n* Constructors + (GP winners\n\t+ Champions)\n\n\n* Engine manufacturers + (GP winners\n\t+ Champions)\n\n\n* + Seasons\n\t+ Grands Prix\n\t+ Circuits\n\n\n* Race Promoters' Trophy winners\n\n\n* Points scoring systems\n\n\n* + National colours\n\t+ Sponsorship liveries\n\n\n* + Racing flags\n\t+ Red-flagged races\n\n\n* + Female drivers\n\t+ TV broadcasters\n\n\n* + Fatalities\n\t+ Video games\n |\n| Records\n* Drivers\n* Constructors\n* Engines\n* Tyres\n* Races\n |\n| Organisations\n* FIA\n* FIA World Motor Sport Council\n* Formula One Group\n* Liberty Media\n* Formula One Constructors' Association\n* Formula One Teams Association\n* Grand Prix Drivers' Association\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe first World Championship Grand Prix was held in 1950 at Silverstone; since then 76 circuits in total have hosted a Grand Prix. A lot of classic (older) circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations throughout their history: Nürburgring, Spa-Francorchamps, Monza, etc. Taking Nürburgring as an example, the first World Championship race there used the 22.835 km (14.189 mi) configuration, but concerns over safety meant that more recent Grands Prix have used a shorter, safer circuit.[5] Formula One circuits were predominantly in Europe during the early years of the championship; as the sport has expanded, so has the location of its circuits. The expansion into Asia and America has been a recent occurrence. Of the 20 circuits that hosted a Grand Prix in 2012, nearly half were not on the calendar before 1999.[6] The Autodromo Nazionale Monza has hosted the most World Championship races; the only season it did not host a race was in 1980, when the Italian Grand Prix was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari.[7] The Miami International Autodrome became the 76th circuit to host a Grand Prix, when it held the Miami Grand Prix in 2022; this is the latest addition to this list. The longest circuit to have hosted a Grand Prix is the Pescara Circuit, which hosted the 1957 Pescara Grand Prix: the 25.800 km (16.031 mi) long circuit in Pescara, Italy, held the annual Coppa Acerbo race, and in 1957 it was the only time that this race was included as part of the World Championship, a race which Stirling Moss won.[8] The Las Vegas Strip Circuit is due to host its first Grand Prix in 2023, with the Las Vegas Grand Prix.[9]\n\n\nAs some circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations, the most recent configuration used is listed in the table below.\n\n\n\n##

The event was held every year from 2004 until 2019 and is contracted to be held in 2024 and 2025.[1] The event was contracted to take place from 2020 to 2023, however the event was cancelled each year as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. \n\n\nIt is currently held at the Shanghai International Circuit, Jiading, Shanghai. Designed by Hermann Tilke and opened in 2004, the US$240 million Shanghai course was the most expensive Formula One circuit facility[2] until the $6 billion Abu Dhabi course opened five years later.[3] The 5.451 km (3.387 mi) track features one of the trickiest corner combinations on the Formula One calendar: Turn 1 and 2, a demanding 270-degree, right-handed corner combination whose radius increases as the corner progresses.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Chinese government began to seek to host an F1 race. After Zhuhai International Circuit was opened in 1996 in the city of Zhuhai in Guangdong Province, southern China, a race there was provisionally added to the 1999 F1 World Championship calendar.[4] But the track failed to meet FIA standard and the race was cancelled.[5]\n\n\nIn 2002, it was announced that the management of the Shanghai International Circuit, with assistance from the organizers of the Macau Grand Prix, had signed a seven-year contract with Formula One Management to host the Chinese Grand Prix from 2004 until 2011.[2] The first Chinese Grand Prix, held on 26 September 2004, was won by Ferrari's Rubens Barrichello. The following year, it hosted the final round of the Formula One championship, in which the newly crowned world champion Fernando Alonso won and claimed the constructor's title for Renault. In 2006, the Chinese Grand Prix was won by Michael Schumacher, his last victory in Formula One.\n\n\nIn November 2008, the BBC reported that a senior race official, Qiu Weichang, had suggested that the money-losing race might be cancelled. Following a similar announcement about the French Grand Prix, Qiu said that the race's future was under consideration, and a decision would be made in 2009.[6]\n\n\n2010 came and went with no formal announcement of an extension to the initial seven-race deal struck in 2004. However, immediately after the 2010 Shanghai race Bernie Ecclestone, who manages the contracts with the various circuits, said of the 2011 calendar, \"We are not dropping anything. [It's] 20 races – getting ready for 25\".[7]\n\n\nIt was only in February 2011 that a deal was agreed between F1 and the organisers of the Chinese round of the world championship.

The event was held every year from 2004 until 2019 and is contracted to be held in 2024 and 2025.[1] The event was contracted to take place from 2020 to 2023, however the event was cancelled each year as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. \n\n\nIt is currently held at the Shanghai International Circuit, Jiading, Shanghai. Designed by Hermann Tilke and opened in 2004, the US$240 million Shanghai course was the most expensive Formula One circuit facility[2] until the $6 billion Abu Dhabi course opened five years later.[3] The 5.451 km (3.387 mi) track features one of the trickiest corner combinations on the Formula One calendar: Turn 1 and 2, a demanding 270-degree, right-handed corner combination whose radius increases as the corner progresses.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Chinese government began to seek to host an F1 race. After Zhuhai International Circuit was opened in 1996 in the city of Zhuhai in Guangdong Province, southern China, a race there was provisionally added to the 1999 F1 World Championship calendar.[4] But the track failed to meet FIA standard and the race was cancelled.[5]\n\n\nIn 2002, it was announced that the management of the Shanghai International Circuit, with assistance from the organizers of the Macau Grand Prix, had signed a seven-year contract with Formula One Management to host the Chinese Grand Prix from 2004 until 2011.[2] The first Chinese Grand Prix, held on 26 September 2004, was won by Ferrari's Rubens Barrichello. The following year, it hosted the final round of the Formula One championship, in which the newly crowned world champion Fernando Alonso won and claimed the constructor's title for Renault. In 2006, the Chinese Grand Prix was won by Michael Schumacher, his last victory in Formula One.\n\n\nIn November 2008, the BBC reported that a senior race official, Qiu Weichang, had suggested that the money-losing race might be cancelled. Following a similar announcement about the French Grand Prix, Qiu said that the race's future was under consideration, and a decision would be made in 2009.[6]\n\n\n2010 came and went with no formal announcement of an extension to the initial seven-race deal struck in 2004. However, immediately after the 2010 Shanghai race Bernie Ecclestone, who manages the contracts with the various circuits, said of the 2011 calendar, \"We are not dropping anything. [It's] 20 races – getting ready for 25\".[7]\n\n\nIt was only in February 2011 that a deal was agreed between F1 and the organisers of the Chinese round of the world championship. Reasons for the delay appear to have been over the fee paid to F1 to host the race. After racking up losses year after year, the organisers of the race refused to pay the fee required, reported to be amongst the highest paid to host an F1 race. F1 bosses appear to have reduced the fee and the new agreement to host an F1 race ran to 2017.[8]\n\n\nIn September 2017, a new three-year contract to host the race was announced, keeping the race on the calendar until 2020.[9][10] In 2019 it hosted the 1000th round of the Formula One World Championship.\n\n\nThe 2020 Chinese Grand Prix, scheduled for 19 April, was postponed and later cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[11] No further editions of the race have been held since; plans for 2021, 2022 and 2023 races were announced and later cancelled.[12] The Chinese Grand Prix is to return to the Formula One calendar in 2024.[13]\n\n\n\n## Winners of the Chinese Grand Prix[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (drivers)[edit]\n\n\n*Drivers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Driver\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | ![United Kingdom](image) **Lewis Hamilton** | 2008, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2019 |\n| 2\n | ![Spain](image) **Fernando Alonso** | 2005, 2013 |\n| ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | 2012, 2016 |\n| Source:[14] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (constructors)[edit]\n\n\n*Teams **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Constructor\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019 |\n| 4\n | ![Italy](image) **Ferrari** | 2004, 2006, 2007, 2013 |\n| 3\n | ![United Kingdom](image) **McLaren** | 2008, 2010, 2011 |\n| 2\n | ![Austria](image) **Red Bull** | 2009, 2018 |\n| Source:[14] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (engine manufacturers)[edit]\n\n\n*Manufacturers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Manufacturer\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9\n | ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019 |\n| 4\n | ![Italy](image) **Ferrari** | 2004, 2006, 2007, 2013 |\n| 2\n | ![France](image) **Renault** | 2005, 2009 |\n| Source:[14] |\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\nAll Chinese Grands Prix have been held at Shanghai International Circuit.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Constructor\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 | ![Brazil](image) Rubens Barrichello | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2005 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Renault | Report |\n| 2006 | ![Germany](image) Michael Schumacher | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2007 | ![Finland](image) Kimi Räikkönen | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2008 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | McLaren-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2009 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull Racing-Renault | Report |\n| 2010 | ![United Kingdom](image) Jenson Button | McLaren-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2011 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | McLaren-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2012 | ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2013 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2014 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2015 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2016 | ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2017 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2018 | ![Australia](image) Daniel Ricciardo | Red Bull Racing-TAG Heuer | Report |\n| 2019 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| Source:[14] |\n\n\n## Support races[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Formula BMW Asia, Porsche Carrera Cup Asia and Asian Formula Renault Challenge supported the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix.

It was part of the Formula One World Championship from 1999 to 2017 and it was held during these years at the Sepang International Circuit. The Malaysian Grand Prix was held annually from 1962 to 1964 in Singapore, whilst it was a member of the Malaysian federation. Subsequent Grands Prix were held in Peninsular Malaysia.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Singapore and Shah Alam[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1962 to 1965 an annual race weekend for motorcycles and Formula Libre cars was held at the Thomson Road circuit in Singapore, named the Malaysia Grand Prix. After Singapore gained independence from Malaysia in 1965 the event was renamed the Singapore Grand Prix and continued until 1973.\n\n\nBetween Singapore's departure from the Malaysian federation and the opening of Sepang Circuit, Malaysia hosted a range of other racing categories in the Malaysian Grand Prix at Shah Alam's own circuit between 1968 and 1995 including Formula Libre (1968), Tasman Formula, (1969-1972), Formula Atlantic (1973–1975), Formula Two (1977) Formula Pacific (1978–1982) and Formula Brabham (1995).\n\n\n\n### Sepang International Circuit[edit]\n\n\nAs part of a series of major infrastructure projects in the 1990s under Mahathir Mohamad's government, the Sepang International Circuit was constructed between 1997 and 1999 close to Putrajaya, the then-newly founded administrative capital of the country, with the intent of hosting the Malaysian Grand Prix. Similar to other of the country's circuits, the circuit is known for its unpredictable humid tropical weather, varying from clear furnace hot days to tropical rain storms.\n\n\nThe inaugural Grand Prix at Sepang was held in 1999, and saw Michael Schumacher return to the sport after his absence due to a broken leg sustained at that year's British Grand Prix.[1] Ferrari dominated the race, with Schumacher handing the victory to title-hopeful teammate Eddie Irvine, only for both Ferraris to be disqualified due to a technical irregularity, before later being reinstated.[2]\n\n\nFrom 2001, the Malaysian Grand Prix moved from the end of the season to the beginning, which has seen some topsy-turvy results as teams and drivers got to grips with their new equipment, with many races heavily influenced by the winners and losers of the scramble for position into the tight double hairpin bend at the first corner.[3]\n\n\nThe 2001 event was hit by a heavy rainstorm in the middle of the race which made conditions very difficult. Conditions were so bad that the two Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello spun off almost simultaneously at the same corner. Remarkably, they both recovered to score a Ferrari 1–2, because for a long time they were nearly 5 seconds faster than anyone else on the field. Elsewhere, the race was even led by Jos Verstappen, surprisingly. However, as the track begun to dry, he fell back to seventh, but his efforts to keep positions were memorable.[4]\n\n\nOn 8 April 2007, shortly before the 2007 Malaysian Grand Prix, Formula One president Bernie Ecclestone was quoted as stating that the circuit was getting \"shabby\" and \"a bit tired\" from the lack of care, describing it as \"an old house that needs a bit of redecorating\". He noted that the circuit itself is not the issue, but rather the surrounding environment; rubbish is said to be littered all over the place, potentially damaging the circuit's good reputation when it was opened in 1999.[5]\n\n\nThe day before, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi had met Ecclestone to discuss an extension of the Formula One contract beyond 2010.[5] While the government had been given an additional extension to host the Grand Prix until 2015, the government was still mulling the offer, as of 23 April 2007.[6] The circuit was given a renewed contract in 2006 to organise the Malaysian Grand Prix for another five years.[5]\n\n\nOn 13 February 2008, the management of the Sepang International Circuit announced its aim to become Formula One's second night race from 2009 after Singapore, following discussions about buying a floodlighting system. Mokhzani Mahathir, the chairman of the circuit, was quoted as saying that the lights \"might be custom made for the circuit.\"[7] However, the organisers ended up settling for a late-afternoon start time.[8]\n\n\nThe 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix was held around sunset, starting at 17:00 local time (09:00 UTC). This proved disastrous due to heavy rainfall. The race was red-flagged and ultimately not restarted due to the low light level making it through the clouds. The race ended on lap 33, and with the regulations requiring 42 laps for full points, both driver and constructor results were halved in relation to points.[9]\n\n\nOn 7 April 2017, it was announced that the 2017 race would be the swansong of the Malaysian Grand Prix.[10][11] The race's contract was due to expire in 2018, but its future had been under threat due to rising hosting fees and declining ticket sales.[12] Malaysia's youth and sports minister at the time Khairy Jamaluddin said on Twitter: \"I think we should stop hosting the F1. At least for a while. Cost too high, returns limited. When we first hosted the F1 it was a big deal. First in Asia outside Japan. Now so many venues. No first mover advantage. Not a novelty.\"[13] The BBC reported that \"Malaysia had struggled in recent years to attract a significant crowd, its appeal having been damaged by the more glamorous night-time event on a street track in Singapore.\"[14]\n\n\n\n## Winners of the Malaysian Grand Prix[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (drivers)[edit]\n\n\n*A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One

It was part of the Formula One World Championship from 1999 to 2017 and it was held during these years at the Sepang International Circuit. The Malaysian Grand Prix was held annually from 1962 to 1964 in Singapore, whilst it was a member of the Malaysian federation. Subsequent Grands Prix were held in Peninsular Malaysia.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Singapore and Shah Alam[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1962 to 1965 an annual race weekend for motorcycles and Formula Libre cars was held at the Thomson Road circuit in Singapore, named the Malaysia Grand Prix. After Singapore gained independence from Malaysia in 1965 the event was renamed the Singapore Grand Prix and continued until 1973.\n\n\nBetween Singapore's departure from the Malaysian federation and the opening of Sepang Circuit, Malaysia hosted a range of other racing categories in the Malaysian Grand Prix at Shah Alam's own circuit between 1968 and 1995 including Formula Libre (1968), Tasman Formula, (1969-1972), Formula Atlantic (1973–1975), Formula Two (1977) Formula Pacific (1978–1982) and Formula Brabham (1995).\n\n\n\n### Sepang International Circuit[edit]\n\n\nAs part of a series of major infrastructure projects in the 1990s under Mahathir Mohamad's government, the Sepang International Circuit was constructed between 1997 and 1999 close to Putrajaya, the then-newly founded administrative capital of the country, with the intent of hosting the Malaysian Grand Prix. Similar to other of the country's circuits, the circuit is known for its unpredictable humid tropical weather, varying from clear furnace hot days to tropical rain storms.\n\n\nThe inaugural Grand Prix at Sepang was held in 1999, and saw Michael Schumacher return to the sport after his absence due to a broken leg sustained at that year's British Grand Prix.[1] Ferrari dominated the race, with Schumacher handing the victory to title-hopeful teammate Eddie Irvine, only for both Ferraris to be disqualified due to a technical irregularity, before later being reinstated.[2]\n\n\nFrom 2001, the Malaysian Grand Prix moved from the end of the season to the beginning, which has seen some topsy-turvy results as teams and drivers got to grips with their new equipment, with many races heavily influenced by the winners and losers of the scramble for position into the tight double hairpin bend at the first corner.[3]\n\n\nThe 2001 event was hit by a heavy rainstorm in the middle of the race which made conditions very difficult. Conditions were so bad that the two Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello spun off almost simultaneously at the same corner. Remarkably, they both recovered to score a Ferrari 1–2, because for a long time they were nearly 5 seconds faster than anyone else on the field. Elsewhere, the race was even led by Jos Verstappen, surprisingly. However, as the track begun to dry, he fell back to seventh, but his efforts to keep positions were memorable.[4]\n\n\nOn 8 April 2007, shortly before the 2007 Malaysian Grand Prix, Formula One president Bernie Ecclestone was quoted as stating that the circuit was getting \"shabby\" and \"a bit tired\" from the lack of care, describing it as \"an old house that needs a bit of redecorating\".

The inaugural edition of the race was held in Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia. It was the fifth full-night race title on the Formula One calendar, following the Singapore, Bahrain, Sakhir and Qatar Grands Prix.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2019, plans for a permanent motorsports complex to be built in the city of Qiddiya near the Saudi capital of Riyadh were made public. The project was conceived by Test and Training International, a motorsports consultancy headed by former Formula One driver Alexander Wurz, with the objective of creating a world-class circuit capable of hosting all FIA categories through to Formula One.[2] In January 2020, plans for a race track in Qiddiya were officially confirmed at an event, where track designer Wurz appeared alongside current and former Formula One drivers who were given the opportunity to drive on the layout in a racing simulator.[3] During the event, it was confirmed that the track was designed to FIA and FIM Grade 1 standards. At the time, Formula One declined to comment on the possibility of a race.[4]\n\n\nThe Saudi Arabian Grand Prix first appeared on the first draft of the 2021 Formula One provisional calendar, which was shown to teams at a Formula One Commission meeting, held in October 2020.[5] The draft calendar saw all 22 races from the original 2020 calendar carried over, with the addition of Saudi Arabia.[6] In November 2020, it was announced that the city of Jeddah would host the inaugural Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, in collaboration with the Saudi Automobile and Motorcycle Federation,[7] and the Jeddah Corniche Circuit would be located along the shore of the Red Sea.[8]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Saudi Arabia's minister of sport Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud expressed interest in having both Jeddah and Qiddiya host annual Formula One races or for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix to alternate between the two venues, once the Qiddiya track opens.[9]\n\n\nIn January 2023 it was reported that race organizers expected that the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix would be held in Jeddah until 2027 while work on the Qiddiya track continues after which the Jeddah circuit may still be used for a separate Saudi Arabian F1 race alongside Qiddiya.[10][11]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Sportswashing\n\nThe Grand Prix has received criticism from Amnesty International on the grounds of human rights in Saudi Arabia, which is a totalitarian state. Human Rights Watch also condemned the decision arguing that \"it is part of a cynical strategy to distract from Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses\". Formula One responded by saying that \"Formula One has made our position on human rights and other issues clear to all our partners and host countries who commit to respect human rights in the way their events are hosted and delivered\" and that \"Formula One has worked hard to be a positive force everywhere it races, including economic, social and cultural benefits\".[12][13] According to Human Rights Watch, the Grand Prix and other sports events are being used by Saudi Arabia to distract people from serious human rights abuses. The Global Initiative Director at Human Rights Watch, Minky Worden, called upon Formula One to assess situation in Saudi Arabia and insist on releasing women's rights defenders who spoke in favour of women's right to drive.[14] In February 2021, 45 human rights organizations called on Lewis Hamilton to boycott the Grand Prix, citing among other factors Saudi Arabia's role in the Yemeni Civil War and the assassination of *The Washington Post* journalist Jamal Khashoggi.[15][16] Saudi Arabia has denied the Grand Prix was being used for sportswashing, arguing that the race forms part of the country's efforts to open itself up to the outside world.[17] The event received criticism from human rights groups. Many accused the Arab nation and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of \"sportswashing\" their image. It was claimed that Saudi Arabia was stepping into some of the biggest sport events to cover its human rights violations.[18]\n\n\nFollowing the missile interception in Diriyah during the 2021 Diriyah ePrix, questions were raised about the event's viability.[19][20] Formula One later stated that they would never go to high security risk areas, though they also stated that they had \"every confidence that the Saudi government and its agencies have both the technology and capability to ensure this safety and security\".[21] During the 2021 race, Lewis Hamilton wore a rainbow-coloured helmet, showing his support for the LGBT community and showed that he wanted the rules on people in the LGBT community to change in Saudi Arabia. He also wore this helmet in the previous and following race.\n\n\nThe 2022 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix was impacted by the Saudi-led intervention in the Yemeni civil war. Yemen’s Houthi rebels carried out a missile attack on an Aramco oil depot (approximately 16 kilometres (10 mi) from the circuit), causing an explosion, during the first of two practice sessions. The incident highlighted risks for the race, with drivers, such as Lewis Hamilton, raising concerns over the event’s safety. After discussions lasting several hours, an agreement was reached to hold the event.[22] Besides the attack, there were serious questions over the years of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. The authoritative regime was criticised for its continued repression of dissidents, particularly in light of the mass execution of 81 people two weeks before the race.[23]\n\n\n\n## Circuit[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jeddah Corniche Circuit\n\nNamed as the 'fastest street track' on the Formula One calendar, with Formula One cars averaging around 250 km/h (160 mph), the track is the second longest on the Formula One calendar behind Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium.[24][25] The circuit is located on the Jeddah Corniche, adjoining the Red Sea. It was designed by Carsten Tilke, son of the famed circuit designer, Hermann Tilke.[26][27]\n\n\nIn Formula One, the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix race and qualifying are both held during the night, under the lights where the temperatures are substantially cooler than the day. The Formula 2 race is held during the day and two of the three Formula One practice sessions are held during daytime and high track temperatures.\n\n\n\n## Winners[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (constructors)[edit]\n\n\n*Teams **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Constructor\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2\n | ![Austria](image) **Red Bull Racing** | 2022, 2023 |\n| Source:[28] |\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\nAll Saudi Arabian Grands Prix were held at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Constructor\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2022 | ![Netherlands](image) Max Verstappen | Red Bull Racing-RBPT | Report |\n| 2023 | ![Mexico](image) Sergio Pérez | Red Bull Racing-Honda RBPT | Report |\n| Source:[29] |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Smith, Luke (5 November 2020). \"Saudi Arabia announces F1 night race in Jeddah for 2021\". *Motorsport.com*.

The inaugural edition of the race was held in Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia. It was the fifth full-night race title on the Formula One calendar, following the Singapore, Bahrain, Sakhir and Qatar Grands Prix.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2019, plans for a permanent motorsports complex to be built in the city of Qiddiya near the Saudi capital of Riyadh were made public. The project was conceived by Test and Training International, a motorsports consultancy headed by former Formula One driver Alexander Wurz, with the objective of creating a world-class circuit capable of hosting all FIA categories through to Formula One.[2] In January 2020, plans for a race track in Qiddiya were officially confirmed at an event, where track designer Wurz appeared alongside current and former Formula One drivers who were given the opportunity to drive on the layout in a racing simulator.[3] During the event, it was confirmed that the track was designed to FIA and FIM Grade 1 standards. At the time, Formula One declined to comment on the possibility of a race.[4]\n\n\nThe Saudi Arabian Grand Prix first appeared on the first draft of the 2021 Formula One provisional calendar, which was shown to teams at a Formula One Commission meeting, held in October 2020.[5] The draft calendar saw all 22 races from the original 2020 calendar carried over, with the addition of Saudi Arabia.[6] In November 2020, it was announced that the city of Jeddah would host the inaugural Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, in collaboration with the Saudi Automobile and Motorcycle Federation,[7] and the Jeddah Corniche Circuit would be located along the shore of the Red Sea.[8]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Saudi Arabia's minister of sport Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud expressed interest in having both Jeddah and Qiddiya host annual Formula One races or for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix to alternate between the two venues, once the Qiddiya track opens.[9]\n\n\nIn January 2023 it was reported that race organizers expected that the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix would be held in Jeddah until 2027 while work on the Qiddiya track continues after which the Jeddah circuit may still be used for a separate Saudi Arabian F1 race alongside Qiddiya.[10][11]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Sportswashing\n\nThe Grand Prix has received criticism from Amnesty International on the grounds of human rights in Saudi Arabia, which is a totalitarian state. Human Rights Watch also condemned the decision arguing that \"it is part of a cynical strategy to distract from Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses\". Formula One responded by saying that \"Formula One has made our position on human rights and other issues clear to all our partners and host countries who commit to respect human rights in the way their events are hosted and delivered\" and that \"Formula One has worked hard to be a positive force everywhere it races, including economic, social and cultural benefits\".[12][13] According to Human Rights Watch, the Grand Prix and other sports events are being used by Saudi Arabia to distract people from serious human rights abuses. The Global Initiative Director at Human Rights Watch, Minky Worden, called upon Formula One to assess situation in Saudi Arabia and insist on releasing women's rights defenders who spoke in favour of women's right to drive.[14] In February 2021, 45 human rights organizations called on Lewis Hamilton to boycott the Grand Prix, citing among other factors Saudi Arabia's role in the Yemeni Civil War and the assassination of *The Washington Post* journalist Jamal Khashoggi.[15][16] Saudi Arabia has denied the Grand Prix was being used for sportswashing, arguing that the race forms part of the country's efforts to open itself up to the outside world.[17] The event received criticism from human rights groups. Many accused the Arab nation and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of \"sportswashing\" their image. It was claimed that Saudi Arabia was stepping into some of the biggest sport events to cover its human rights violations.[18]\n\n\nFollowing the missile interception in Diriyah during the 2021 Diriyah ePrix, questions were raised about the event's viability.[19][20] Formula One later stated that they would never go to high security risk areas, though they also stated that they had \"every confidence that the Saudi government and its agencies have both the technology and capability to ensure this safety and security\".[21] During the 2021 race, Lewis Hamilton wore a rainbow-coloured helmet, showing his support for the LGBT community and showed that he wanted the rules on people in the LGBT community to change in Saudi Arabia. He also wore this helmet in the previous and following race.\n\n\nThe 2022 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix was impacted by the Saudi-led intervention in the Yemeni civil war. Yemen’s Houthi rebels carried out a missile attack on an Aramco oil depot (approximately 16 kilometres (10 mi) from the circuit), causing an explosion, during the first of two practice sessions. The incident highlighted risks for the race, with drivers, such as Lewis Hamilton, raising concerns over the event’s safety. After discussions lasting several hours, an agreement was reached to hold the event.[22] Besides the attack, there were serious questions over the years of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. The authoritative regime was criticised for its continued repression of dissidents, particularly in light of the mass execution of 81 people two weeks before the race.[23]\n\n\n\n## Circuit[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jeddah Corniche Circuit\n\nNamed as the 'fastest street track' on the Formula One calendar, with Formula One cars averaging around 250 km/h (160 mph), the track is the second longest on the Formula One calendar behind Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium.[24][25] The circuit is located on the Jeddah Corniche, adjoining the Red Sea. It was designed by Carsten Tilke, son of the famed circuit designer, Hermann Tilke.[26][27]\n\n\nIn Formula One, the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix race and qualifying are both held during the night, under the lights where the temperatures are substantially cooler than the day. The Formula 2 race is held during the day and two of the three Formula One practice sessions are held during daytime and high track temperatures.\n\n\n\n## Winners[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (constructors)[edit]\n\n\n*Teams **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Constructor\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2\n | ![Austria](image) **Red Bull Racing** | 2022, 2023 |\n| Source:[28] |\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\nAll Saudi Arabian Grands Prix were held at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Constructor\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2022 | ![Netherlands](image) Max Verstappen | Red Bull Racing-RBPT | Report |\n| 2023 | ![Mexico](image) Sergio Pérez | Red Bull Racing-Honda RBPT | Report |\n| Source:[29] |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Smith, Luke (5 November 2020). \"Saudi Arabia announces F1 night race in Jeddah for 2021\". *Motorsport.com*.

It made history as the first Formula One Grand Prix to be held in the Middle East, and was given the award for the \"Best Organised Grand Prix\" by the FIA.[2] The race has in the past been the third race of the Formula One calendar. However, in the 2006 season, Bahrain swapped places with the traditional opener, the Australian Grand Prix, which was pushed back to avoid a clash with the Commonwealth Games. In 2010, Bahrain staged the opening race of the 2010 season and the cars drove the full 6.299 km (3.914 mi) \"Endurance Circuit\" to celebrate F1's 'diamond jubilee'. In 2021, the Bahrain Grand Prix was the season opener again because the 2021 Australian Grand Prix was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nThe 2011 edition, due to be held on 13 March, was cancelled on 21 February due to the 2011 Bahraini protests[3] after drivers including Damon Hill and Mark Webber had protested.[4] Human rights activists called for a cancellation of the 2012 race due to reports of human rights abuses committed by the Bahraini authorities.[5] Team personnel also voiced concerns about safety,[6] but the race, nonetheless, was held as planned on 22 April 2012.\n\n\nIn 2014, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the first staging of the Bahrain Grand Prix, the race was held as a night event under floodlights.[7] In so doing it became the second Formula One night race after the Singapore Grand Prix in 2008. Bahrain's inaugural night event was won by Lewis Hamilton. Subsequent races have also been night races.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Bahrain International Circuit in 2010\nThe construction of the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir began in 2002. Bahrain had fought off fierce competition from elsewhere in the region to stage a F1 race, with Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates all hoping for the prestige of hosting a Formula One Grand Prix. \n\n\nThe race has been held in every Formula One season since 2004, with the exception of 2011, due to the 2011 Bahraini uprising. The first Bahrain Grand Prix was won by Michael Schumacher, driving for Ferrari. The following two editions, in 2005 and 2006, were won by Fernando Alonso, racing for Renault, and Felipe Massa won the 2007 and 2008 editions of the race for Ferrari. Jenson Button won the 2009 Bahrain Grand Prix driving for Brawn GP, and Fernando Alonso won his third Bahrain Grand Prix in 2010 driving for Ferrari. Following the cancellation of the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix, Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull won the 2012 and 2013 Grands Prix, followed by Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes winning in 2014 and 2015. Hamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg won in 2016, and Sebastian Vettel won another two editions of the race for Ferrari in 2017 and 2018. Lewis Hamilton then proceeded to win the following three Grands Prix, in 2019, 2020, and 2021, setting the record for the most Bahrain Grand Prix wins, with five. The 2022 round was won by Charles Leclerc, giving the Scuderia Ferrari their record seventh Bahrain Grand Prix victory. The most recent edition, held in 2023, was won by Max Verstappen of Red Bull Racing, their first Bahrain Grand Prix victory in over ten years.[8][9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Endurance circuit, used in 2010\nThe 2010 edition of the race saw a different circuit configuration used for the Grand Prix. The \"Endurance Circuit\" layout was used instead of the \"Grand Prix Circuit\" layout, extending the lap length to 6.299 km (3.914 mi).[10] The track was planned to revert back to its original layout for the 2011 edition,[11] and did so for the 2012 edition.[12]\n\n\nIn February 2022, it was reported that the event's contract had been extended to last until the 2036 Formula One season.[13]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\nOne notable characteristic of the course is its large run-off areas, which have been criticised for not punishing drivers who stray off the track. However, they tend to prevent sand getting onto the track. The circuit is regarded as one of the safest in the world.[14]\n\n\nAlthough alcoholic beverages are legal in Bahrain, the drivers do not spray the traditional champagne on the podium, instead spraying a non-alcoholic rosewater drink known as Waard.[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\n### 2011 cancellation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix\n\n![](image)A demonstrator protesting against the race\nOn 21 February 2011, it was announced that the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix scheduled for 13 March was cancelled due to the 2011 Bahraini protests.[3][15] On 3 June, FIA decided to reschedule the race for 30 October. World champion racer Damon Hill called on Formula One not to reschedule saying that if the race went ahead \"we will forever have the blight of association with repressive methods to achieve order\".[16] Bernie Ecclestone told the BBC in an interview: \"Hopefully there'll be peace and quiet and we can return in the future, but of course it's not on. The schedule cannot be rescheduled without the agreement of the participants – they're the facts.\"[17] A week after its decision to reschedule the race, Formula One announced the cancellation of the race for 2011.[4]\n\n\n\n### 2012 controversy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix\n\n![](image)A graffiti in Bahrain village\nHuman rights activists called for a cancellation of the 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix, which took place on 22 April, because of reports of ongoing use of excessive force by authorities and torture in detention.[5][18][19] That includes the killing of activist Salah Abbas Habib during a demonstration on the eve of the Grand Prix,[20] as well as the earlier fatal shooting of photojournalist Ahmed Ismael Hassan al-Samadi, who was covering a protest against the Bahrain Grand Prix.[21]\n\n\nOn 9 April 2012, *The Guardian* reported that according to an unnamed leading member of one of the teams who said his views were representative, \"the Formula One teams want the sport's governing body to cancel – or at least postpone – the Bahrain Grand Prix ..., because of increasing safety concerns amid ongoing protests in the kingdom ... I feel very uncomfortable about going to Bahrain. If I'm brutally frank, the only way they can pull this race off without incident is to have a complete military lockdown there. And I think that would be unacceptable, both for F1 and for Bahrain. But I don't see any other way they can do it\".[6]\n\n\nIn that context, Anonymous launched on 21 April 2012 the operation opBahrain, threatening the Formula 1 representatives of a cyberattack in case they go on with Bahrain Grand Prix. Hours later, Anonymous hackers took down the f1-racers.net website after launching a distributed denial-of-service attack on it.[22]\n\n\n\n### Continuing controversy[edit]\n\n\nSince the global media attention over the large scale demonstrations in 2011 and 2012, there have been continued reports from human rights groups about abuses and jailings in Bahrain relating to F1 protests. Among them are photographer Ahmed Humaidan, who was one of about 30 people jailed for roles in the 2012 protest,[23] and activist Najah Ahmed Yousif, who is in prison, and has been physically and sexually abused, for criticising the Bahrain F1 on social media.[24][25] Rights organisations continue to criticise the Formula One Group and Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) for refusing to follow their own Statement of Commitment to Respect for Human Rights, saying that by not leveraging their position of power to take action against such political crackdown, the F1 organisers are complicit to the dissidents' suffering.[26] In 2018, F1 \"admitted concern\" for Yousif, after continued public and media pressure; however, there has been no known follow up since.[27]\n\n\nA collection of human rights groups, led by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD), have claimed that the Bahrain Grand Prix has become a focal point of popular protests and serious human rights abuses committed by Bahraini security forces against protesters. The NGOs accuse F1 of performing invaluable PR for Bahrain's government and that it risked further normalizing of the human rights violations in the country.[28] In letters to Lewis Hamilton, three Bahraini political prisoners praised his commitment towards human rights issues, and requested him as an F1 world champion to bring their plight in notice of a wider audience.[29] The Grand Prix has been cited as an example of sportswashing.[30]\n\n\n\n### 2020 postponement[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Formula One World Championship\n\nResponding to the COVID-19 pandemic, event organisers announced that no spectators would be permitted to attend the race that had been due to take place on 22 March.[31] However, a fortnight before the race was due to take place, the race was indefinitely postponed.[32] The race was rescheduled to 29 November, and it was one of two events held around the Bahrain International Circuit across two weekends, with the second race taking place on the outer layout and being named the Sakhir Grand Prix.\n\n\n\n### 2020 controversy[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the rescheduled F1 calendar, Bahrain was announced as hosting two races back to back November 2020. However, the event received backlash not only from human rights organizations, but also from F1's newly crowned, seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton issued a warning to F1 and called on the sport to face its responsibilities and confront / deal with the human rights issues in the countries it visits. A consortium of human rights organizations led by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) wrote to Formula One CEO, Chase Carey that the race in Bahrain became a focal point of protests in the country and human rights abuses carried out by Bahraini security against demonstrators. The government of Bahrain, on the other hand, denied allegations of sportswashing.[33]\n\n\n\n### Legal complaint over Bahrain contract[edit]\n\n\nOn 27 October 2022, the F1 was hit with a legal complaint that it turned a blind eye to human rights violations when it announced in February that the Bahrain GP will stay on the calendar until 2036. The claim said F1 breached Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines. The complaint, made through the British government’s UK National Contact Point (NCP), was served by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (Bird) and two alleged torture survivors from Bahrain, Najah Yusuf and Hajer Mansoor.[34]\n\n\n\n## Winners[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (drivers)[edit]\n\n\n*Drivers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Driver\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 5\n | ![United Kingdom](image) **Lewis Hamilton** | 2014, 2015, 2019, 2020, 2021 |\n| 4\n | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | 2012, 2013, 2017, 2018 |\n| 3\n | ![Spain](image) **Fernando Alonso** | 2005, 2006, 2010 |\n| 2\n | ![Brazil](image) Felipe Massa | 2007, 2008 |\n| Source:[9] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (constructors)[edit]\n\n\n*Teams **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Constructor\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | ![Italy](image) **Ferrari** | 2004, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2017, 2018, 2022 |\n| 6\n | ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2014, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, 2021 |\n| 3\n | ![Austria](image) **Red Bull** | 2012, 2013, 2023 |\n| 2\n | ![France](image) Renault | 2005, 2006 |\n| Source:[9] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (engine manufacturers)[edit]\n\n\n*Manufacturers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Manufacturer\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | ![Italy](image) **Ferrari** | 2004, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2017, 2018, 2022 |\n| ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2009, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, 2021 |\n| 4\n | ![France](image) **Renault** | 2005, 2006, 2012, 2013 |\n| Source:[9] |\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Constructor\n | Configuration\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 | ![Germany](image) Michael Schumacher | Ferrari | Grand Prix Circuit | Report |\n| 2005 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Renault | Report |\n| 2006 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Renault | Report |\n| 2007 | ![Brazil](image) Felipe Massa | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2008 | ![Brazil](image) Felipe Massa | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2009 | ![United Kingdom](image) Jenson Button | Brawn-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2010 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Ferrari | Endurance Circuit | Report |\n| 2011 | *Cancelled due to 2011 Bahraini uprising* | Report |\n| 2012 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Grand Prix Circuit | Report |\n| 2013 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Report |\n| 2014 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2015 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2016 | ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2017 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2018 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2019 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2020 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2021 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2022 | ![Monaco](image) Charles Leclerc | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2023 | ![Netherlands](image) Max Verstappen | Red Bull-Honda RBPT | Report |\n| Sources:[9][8] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Tourism in Bahrain\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Grandprix.com. \"Gulf Air to sponsor Bahrain Grand Prix\". *www.grandprix.com*.

It made history as the first Formula One Grand Prix to be held in the Middle East, and was given the award for the \"Best Organised Grand Prix\" by the FIA.[2] The race has in the past been the third race of the Formula One calendar. However, in the 2006 season, Bahrain swapped places with the traditional opener, the Australian Grand Prix, which was pushed back to avoid a clash with the Commonwealth Games. In 2010, Bahrain staged the opening race of the 2010 season and the cars drove the full 6.299 km (3.914 mi) \"Endurance Circuit\" to celebrate F1's 'diamond jubilee'. In 2021, the Bahrain Grand Prix was the season opener again because the 2021 Australian Grand Prix was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nThe 2011 edition, due to be held on 13 March, was cancelled on 21 February due to the 2011 Bahraini protests[3] after drivers including Damon Hill and Mark Webber had protested.[4] Human rights activists called for a cancellation of the 2012 race due to reports of human rights abuses committed by the Bahraini authorities.[5] Team personnel also voiced concerns about safety,[6] but the race, nonetheless, was held as planned on 22 April 2012.\n\n\nIn 2014, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the first staging of the Bahrain Grand Prix, the race was held as a night event under floodlights.[7] In so doing it became the second Formula One night race after the Singapore Grand Prix in 2008. Bahrain's inaugural night event was won by Lewis Hamilton. Subsequent races have also been night races.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Bahrain International Circuit in 2010\nThe construction of the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir began in 2002. Bahrain had fought off fierce competition from elsewhere in the region to stage a F1 race, with Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates all hoping for the prestige of hosting a Formula One Grand Prix. \n\n\nThe race has been held in every Formula One season since 2004, with the exception of 2011, due to the 2011 Bahraini uprising. The first Bahrain Grand Prix was won by Michael Schumacher, driving for Ferrari. The following two editions, in 2005 and 2006, were won by Fernando Alonso, racing for Renault, and Felipe Massa won the 2007 and 2008 editions of the race for Ferrari. Jenson Button won the 2009 Bahrain Grand Prix driving for Brawn GP, and Fernando Alonso won his third Bahrain Grand Prix in 2010 driving for Ferrari. Following the cancellation of the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix, Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull won the 2012 and 2013 Grands Prix, followed by Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes winning in 2014 and 2015. Hamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg won in 2016, and Sebastian Vettel won another two editions of the race for Ferrari in 2017 and 2018. Lewis Hamilton then proceeded to win the following three Grands Prix, in 2019, 2020, and 2021, setting the record for the most Bahrain Grand Prix wins, with five. The 2022 round was won by Charles Leclerc, giving the Scuderia Ferrari their record seventh Bahrain Grand Prix victory. The most recent edition, held in 2023, was won by Max Verstappen of Red Bull Racing, their first Bahrain Grand Prix victory in over ten years.[8][9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Endurance circuit, used in 2010\nThe 2010 edition of the race saw a different circuit configuration used for the Grand Prix. The \"Endurance Circuit\" layout was used instead of the \"Grand Prix Circuit\" layout, extending the lap length to 6.299 km (3.914 mi).[10] The track was planned to revert back to its original layout for the 2011 edition,[11] and did so for the 2012 edition.[12]\n\n\nIn February 2022, it was reported that the event's contract had been extended to last until the 2036 Formula One season.[13]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\nOne notable characteristic of the course is its large run-off areas, which have been criticised for not punishing drivers who stray off the track. However, they tend to prevent sand getting onto the track. The circuit is regarded as one of the safest in the world.[14]\n\n\nAlthough alcoholic beverages are legal in Bahrain, the drivers do not spray the traditional champagne on the podium, instead spraying a non-alcoholic rosewater drink known as Waard.[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\n### 2011 cancellation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix\n\n![](image)A demonstrator protesting against the race\nOn 21 February 2011, it was announced that the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix scheduled for 13 March was cancelled due to the 2011 Bahraini protests.[3][15] On 3 June, FIA decided to reschedule the race for 30 October. World champion racer Damon Hill called on Formula One not to reschedule saying that if the race went ahead \"we will forever have the blight of association with repressive methods to achieve order\".[16] Bernie Ecclestone told the BBC in an interview: \"Hopefully there'll be peace and quiet and we can return in the future, but of course it's not on. The schedule cannot be rescheduled without the agreement of the participants – they're the facts.\"[17] A week after its decision to reschedule the race, Formula One announced the cancellation of the race for 2011.[4]\n\n\n\n### 2012 controversy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix\n\n![](image)A graffiti in Bahrain village\nHuman rights activists called for a cancellation of the 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix, which took place on 22 April, because of reports of ongoing use of excessive force by authorities and torture in detention.[5][18][19] That includes the killing of activist Salah Abbas Habib during a demonstration on the eve of the Grand Prix,[20] as well as the earlier fatal shooting of photojournalist Ahmed Ismael Hassan al-Samadi, who was covering a protest against the Bahrain Grand Prix.[21]\n\n\nOn 9 April 2012, *The Guardian* reported that according to an unnamed leading member of one of the teams who said his views were representative, \"the Formula One teams want the sport's governing body to cancel – or at least postpone – the Bahrain Grand Prix ..., because of increasing safety concerns amid ongoing protests in the kingdom ... I feel very uncomfortable about going to Bahrain. If I'm brutally frank, the only way they can pull this race off without incident is to have a complete military lockdown there. And I think that would be unacceptable, both for F1 and for Bahrain. But I don't see any other way they can do it\".[6]\n\n\nIn that context, Anonymous launched on 21 April 2012 the operation opBahrain, threatening the Formula 1 representatives of a cyberattack in case they go on with Bahrain Grand Prix. Hours later, Anonymous hackers took down the f1-racers.net website after launching a distributed denial-of-service attack on it.[22]\n\n\n\n### Continuing controversy[edit]\n\n\nSince the global media attention over the large scale demonstrations in 2011 and 2012, there have been continued reports from human rights groups about abuses and jailings in Bahrain relating to F1 protests. Among them are photographer Ahmed Humaidan, who was one of about 30 people jailed for roles in the 2012 protest,[23] and activist Najah Ahmed Yousif, who is in prison, and has been physically and sexually abused, for criticising the Bahrain F1 on social media.[24][25] Rights organisations continue to criticise the Formula One Group and Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) for refusing to follow their own Statement of Commitment to Respect for Human Rights, saying that by not leveraging their position of power to take action against such political crackdown, the F1 organisers are complicit to the dissidents' suffering.[26] In 2018, F1 \"admitted concern\" for Yousif, after continued public and media pressure; however, there has been no known follow up since.[27]\n\n\nA collection of human rights groups, led by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD), have claimed that the Bahrain Grand Prix has become a focal point of popular protests and serious human rights abuses committed by Bahraini security forces against protesters. The NGOs accuse F1 of performing invaluable PR for Bahrain's government and that it risked further normalizing of the human rights violations in the country.[28] In letters to Lewis Hamilton, three Bahraini political prisoners praised his commitment towards human rights issues, and requested him as an F1 world champion to bring their plight in notice of a wider audience.[29] The Grand Prix has been cited as an example of sportswashing.[30]\n\n\n\n### 2020 postponement[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Formula One World Championship\n\nResponding to the COVID-19 pandemic, event organisers announced that no spectators would be permitted to attend the race that had been due to take place on 22 March.[31] However, a fortnight before the race was due to take place, the race was indefinitely postponed.[32] The race was rescheduled to 29 November, and it was one of two events held around the Bahrain International Circuit across two weekends, with the second race taking place on the outer layout and being named the Sakhir Grand Prix.\n\n\n\n### 2020 controversy[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the rescheduled F1 calendar, Bahrain was announced as hosting two races back to back November 2020. However, the event received backlash not only from human rights organizations, but also from F1's newly crowned, seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton issued a warning to F1 and called on the sport to face its responsibilities and confront / deal with the human rights issues in the countries it visits. A consortium of human rights organizations led by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) wrote to Formula One CEO, Chase Carey that the race in Bahrain became a focal point of protests in the country and human rights abuses carried out by Bahraini security against demonstrators. The government of Bahrain, on the other hand, denied allegations of sportswashing.[33]\n\n\n\n### Legal complaint over Bahrain contract[edit]\n\n\nOn 27 October 2022, the F1 was hit with a legal complaint that it turned a blind eye to human rights violations when it announced in February that the Bahrain GP will stay on the calendar until 2036. The claim said F1 breached Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines. The complaint, made through the British government’s UK National Contact Point (NCP), was served by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (Bird) and two alleged torture survivors from Bahrain, Najah Yusuf and Hajer Mansoor.[34]\n\n\n\n## Winners[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (drivers)[edit]\n\n\n*Drivers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Driver\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 5\n | ![United Kingdom](image) **Lewis Hamilton** | 2014, 2015, 2019, 2020, 2021 |\n| 4\n | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | 2012, 2013, 2017, 2018 |\n| 3\n | ![Spain](image) **Fernando Alonso** | 2005, 2006, 2010 |\n| 2\n | ![Brazil](image) Felipe Massa | 2007, 2008 |\n| Source:[9] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (constructors)[edit]\n\n\n*Teams **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Constructor\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | ![Italy](image) **Ferrari** | 2004, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2017, 2018, 2022 |\n| 6\n | ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2014, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, 2021 |\n| 3\n | ![Austria](image) **Red Bull** | 2012, 2013, 2023 |\n| 2\n | ![France](image) Renault | 2005, 2006 |\n| Source:[9] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (engine manufacturers)[edit]\n\n\n*Manufacturers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Manufacturer\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | ![Italy](image) **Ferrari** | 2004, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2017, 2018, 2022 |\n| ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2009, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, 2021 |\n| 4\n | ![France](image) **Renault** | 2005, 2006, 2012, 2013 |\n| Source:[9] |\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Constructor\n | Configuration\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 | ![Germany](image) Michael Schumacher | Ferrari | Grand Prix Circuit | Report |\n| 2005 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Renault | Report |\n| 2006 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Renault | Report |\n| 2007 | ![Brazil](image) Felipe Massa | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2008 | ![Brazil](image) Felipe Massa | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2009 | ![United Kingdom](image) Jenson Button | Brawn-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2010 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Ferrari | Endurance Circuit | Report |\n| 2011 | *Cancelled due to 2011 Bahraini uprising* | Report |\n| 2012 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Grand Prix Circuit | Report |\n| 2013 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Report |\n| 2014 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2015 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2016 | ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2017 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2018 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2019 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2020 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2021 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2022 | ![Monaco](image) Charles Leclerc | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2023 | ![Netherlands](image) Max Verstappen | Red Bull-Honda RBPT | Report |\n| Sources:[9][8] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Tourism in Bahrain\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Grandprix.com. \"Gulf Air to sponsor Bahrain Grand Prix\". *www.grandprix.com*.
