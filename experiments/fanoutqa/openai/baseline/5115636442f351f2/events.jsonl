The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane.\n\n\nKauffman and Crane began developing *Friends* under the working title *Insomnia Cafe* between November and December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including title changes to *Six of One*[2] and *Friends Like Us*, the series was finally named *Friends*.[3] Filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions and Warner Bros. Television.\n\n\nThe show ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings; it ultimately reached the number-one spot in its eighth season. The series finale aired on May 6, 2004, and was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fifth-most-watched series finale in television history[4][5][6] and the most-watched television episode of the 2000s.[7][8] *Friends* received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular television shows of all time.[9] The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series award in 2002 for its eighth season.[10] The show ranked no. 21 on *TV Guide*'s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time,[11] and no. 5 on *Empire* magazine's The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.[12] In 1997, the episode \"The One with the Prom Video\" was ranked no. 100 on *TV Guide*'s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time.[13] In 2013, *Friends* ranked no. 24 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 Best Written TV Series of All Time,[14] and no. 28 on *TV Guide*'s 60 Best TV Series of All Time.[15] The sitcom's cast members returned for *Friends: The Reunion*, a reunion special which was released on HBO Max on May 27, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nSet in New York, N.Y, this series follows the eventful day-to-day lives of a group of 6 unique 20-something friends as they live, work, and love in the city.\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Friends and Joey characters\n\n* Main cast\n* ![Jennifer Aniston](image)\n\nJennifer Aniston as   \nRachel Green\n* ![Courteney Cox](image)\n\nCourteney Cox as   \nMonica Geller\n* ![Lisa Kudrow](image)\n\nLisa Kudrow as   \nPhoebe Buffay\n* ![Matt LeBlanc](image)\n\nMatt LeBlanc as   \nJoey Tribbiani\n* ![Matthew Perry](image)\n\nMatthew Perry as   \nChandler Bing\n* ![David Schwimmer](image)\n\nDavid Schwimmer as   \nRoss Geller\n\n\n* Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green:   \nA fashion enthusiast and Monica Geller's best friend from childhood. Rachel first moves in with Monica in season one after nearly marrying Barry Farber. Rachel and Ross Geller are later involved in an on-again, off-again relationship throughout the series. Rachel dates other men during the series, such as Italian neighbor, Paolo, in season one; Joshua Bergin, a client from Bloomingdale's, in season four; Tag Jones, her assistant, in season seven; and Joey Tribbiani, one of her close friends, in season ten. Rachel's first job is as a waitress at the coffee house Central Perk, but she later becomes an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's in season three, and a buyer at Ralph Lauren in season five. Rachel and Ross have a daughter named Emma in \"The One Where Rachel Has a Baby, Part Two\" at the end of season eight. In the final episode of the series, Ross and Rachel confess their love for each other, and Rachel gives up a dream fashion job at Louis Vuitton in Paris to be with him. It is heavily implied in the spin-off series, *Joey*, that Rachel married Ross after the series finale.\n* Courteney Cox as Monica Geller:   \nThe \"mother hen\" of the group and a chef,[16] known for her perfectionist, bossy, competitive, and obsessive-compulsive nature.[17][18] Monica was overweight as a child. She works as a chef in various restaurants throughout the show. Monica's first serious relationship is with a long-time family friend Richard Burke, who is twenty-one years her senior. The two maintain a strong relationship for some time until Richard expresses that he does not want to have children. Monica and Chandler, one of her best friends, later start a relationship after spending a night with each other in London in the season four finale, leading to their marriage in season seven and the adoption of twins at the end of the series.\n* Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay:   \nA masseuse and self-taught musician. As a child, Phoebe lived in upstate New York with her mother, until her mother committed suicide and Phoebe took to the streets. She writes and sings her own strange songs, accompanying herself on the guitar. She has an identical twin named Ursula, who shares few of Phoebe's traits. Phoebe has three serious relationships over the show's run: David, a scientist, in season one, with whom she breaks up when he moves to Minsk on a research grant; Gary, a police officer whose badge she finds, in season five; and an on-and-off relationship with Mike Hannigan in seasons nine and ten. In season nine, Phoebe and Mike break up due to his desire not to marry. David returns from Minsk, leading to the two getting back together, but she eventually rejects him for Mike when both of them propose to her. Phoebe and Mike marry in season ten.[19][20]\n* Matt LeBlanc as Joey Tribbiani:   \nA struggling actor and food lover who becomes famous for his role on soap opera *Days of Our Lives* as Dr. Drake Ramoray. Joey has many short-term girlfriends. Despite his womanizing, Joey is innocent, caring, and well-intentioned.[21] Joey often uses the catchphrase pick-up line \"How you doin'?\" in his attempts to win over most of the women he meets. Joey rooms with his best friend Chandler for years, and later with Rachel. He falls in love with Rachel in season eight, but Rachel politely tells Joey that she does not share his feelings. They eventually date briefly in season ten, but after realizing it will not work due to their friendship and Rachel's complicated relationship with Ross, they return to being friends. At the end of the series, he is the only remaining single member of the group, and becomes the main protagonist of the sequel series *Joey*.\n* Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing:   \nAn executive in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large, multinational corporation. Chandler hates this job, although it pays well. He attempts to quit during season one but is lured back with a new office and a pay raise. He eventually quits this job in season nine due to a transfer to Tulsa. He becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency later that season. Chandler has a peculiar family history being the son of an erotic novelist mother and a gay, cross-dressing Las Vegas star father. Chandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor and bad luck in relationships.[22] Chandler marries Monica, one of his best friends, in season seven, and they adopt twins at the end of the series. Before his relationship with Monica, Chandler dated Janice Hosenstein in season one and subsequently broke up with her many times.\n* David Schwimmer as Ross Geller:   \nMonica's \"geeky\" older brother, a palaeontologist working at the American Museum of Natural History, and later a tenured professor of palaeontology at New York University. Ross is involved in an on-again, off-again relationship with Rachel throughout the series. He has three failed marriages during the series: Carol Willick, a lesbian who is also the mother of his son, Ben Geller; Emily Waltham, who divorces him after he accidentally says Rachel's name instead of hers during their wedding vows; and Rachel, as the two drunkenly marry in Las Vegas. His divorces become a running joke within the series. Following a one-night stand, he and Rachel have a daughter, Emma, by the end of season eight. They finally confess that they are still in love with each other in the series finale. It is heavily implied in the spin-off series, *Joey*, that Ross married Rachel after the series finale.\n\n\nJames Michael Tyler appears as Gunther, a barista at Central Perk, in every season of the show, but is only ever credited as a guest star. Gunther has a mostly secret profound love for Rachel throughout the entire series. At one point he becomes the manager of the coffee house. It is revealed that Gunther speaks Dutch in addition to English, as well as being a former soap opera actor.\n\n\nIn their original contracts for the first season, cast members were paid $22,500 per episode.[23] The cast members received different salaries in the second season, beginning from the $20,000 range to $40,000 per episode.[23][24] Before their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals.[25] The actors were given the salary of the least paid cast member. The stars were each paid $75,000 per episode in season three, $85,000 in season four, $100,000 in season five, $125,000 in season six, $750,000 in seasons seven and eight, and $1 million in seasons nine and ten, making Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow the highest-paid TV actresses of all time.[26][27][28] The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations. At the time, that financial benefit of a piece of the show's lucrative back-end profits had only been given out to stars who had ownership rights in a show, like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby.[29]\n\n\nSeries creator David Crane wanted all six actors to be equally prominent,[30] and the series was lauded as being \"the first true 'ensemble' show.\"[31] The cast members made efforts to keep the ensemble format and not allow one member to dominate;[31] they entered themselves in the same acting categories for awards,[32] opted for collective salary negotiations,[31] and asked to appear together on magazine cover photos in the first season.[33] The cast members also became best friends off-screen,[34] so much so that recurring guest star Tom Selleck reported that he sometimes felt left out.[35]\n\n\nThe cast remained good friends after the series run, most notably Cox and Aniston, with Aniston being godmother to Cox and David Arquette's daughter, Coco.[36] In the official farewell commemorative book *Friends 'Til the End*, each separately acknowledged in interviews that the cast had become their family.[37][38]\n\n\n\n## Season synopses[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Friends episodes\n\n![](image)*Friends* in first season.

Rachel arrives at Central Perk, wearing her wedding dress, after leaving her fiancé, Barry, an orthodontist, at the altar. She moves into her high school friend Monica's apartment, and gets a waitress job at Central Perk.\n\n\nRoss, who has had a crush on Rachel since high school, often attempts to declare his feelings for her. However many obstacles stand in his way, including his insecurities, Rachel dating an Italian neighbor named Paolo, and the fact that he is expecting a baby with his lesbian ex-wife, Carol, who gives birth to Ben later in the season. Joey never has a steady girlfriend and constantly sleeps with a variety of women. Phoebe is rather odd and complex, mostly due to her mother's suicide when she was a child and having lived on the streets for a time. However, the gang loves her regardless.\n\n\nChandler breaks up with his girlfriend, Janice (Maggie Wheeler), only to find himself reconnecting with her throughout the series. Near the end of the season, while Ross is at a paleontology dig in China, Chandler accidentally lets slip that Ross loves Rachel, who then realizes that she also cares for him. The season ends with Rachel waiting at the airport for Ross, who is returning from China.\n\n\n\n### Season 2[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 2)\n\nRachel greets Ross at the airport only to discover that he has returned with Julie (Lauren Tom), someone he knew from graduate school. Rachel's attempts to tell Ross that she loves him initially mirror his failed attempts in the first season. After he breaks up with Julie for Rachel, friction between them develops when Rachel discovers Ross's list of the cons of dating her. They eventually begin a relationship after Rachel sees an old home video from her and Monica's prom night and realizes Ross was going to stand in for her prom date who nearly stood her up.\n\n\nMonica is promoted to head chef at the Iridium restaurant, then gets fired for accepting gifts from a supplier, which is against company policy. Needing money, she is forced to take an embarrassing job as a waitress at a 1950s-style diner. She begins dating Richard Burke (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced family friend who is 21 years her senior. They eventually break up when Monica realizes that Richard, already a father, does not want more children. Joey is cast in a fictional version of the soap opera, *Days of Our Lives* as neurosurgeon Dr. Drake Ramoray. He moves out of his and Chandler's apartment, forcing Chandler to get a new roommate, Eddie (Adam Goldberg).\n\n\nHowever, Eddie is annoying and somewhat deranged. When Joey claims in a soap opera magazine interview that he writes many of his own lines, offending the show's writer, his character is killed off. No longer able to afford his expensive new apartment, Joey moves back in with Chandler, kicking Eddie out in the process. In the season finale, Chandler talks to an anonymous woman in an online chat room. When they agree to meet in person, the woman turns out to be Janice.\n\n\n\n### Season 3[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 3)\n\nSeason 3 takes on a significantly more serialized format. Chandler and Janice date for several episodes until Joey catches Janice kissing her soon-to-be ex-husband. Not wanting to destroy her family, Chandler urges Janice to go back to her husband, then becomes depressed over the breakup for several episodes. Rachel quits her job at Central Perk and begins working at Bloomingdale's, an upscale department store chain. Ross soon becomes jealous of her colleague Mark and frustrated by Rachel's long work hours. She is tired of his constant jealousy and insecurity, and decides they need a relationship break.\n\n\nRoss, hurt and somewhat drunk, immediately sleeps with Chloe, \"the hot girl from the Xerox place,\" causing Rachel to break up with him completely. Although Phoebe initially believes she has no family except her twin sister Ursula (Lisa Kudrow), she learns she has a half-brother, Frank Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi) and discovers her birth mother, Phoebe Abbott (Teri Garr) over the course of the season. Joey falls in love with his acting partner Kate (Dina Meyer), but is jealous of her dating the director of their play. They begin a brief relationship that ends when she takes an acting job in Los Angeles.\n\n\nMonica dates millionaire Pete Becker (Jon Favreau), despite her initially not being attracted to him. However, she breaks up with Pete after he is seriously hurt trying to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion and refuses to quit. Phoebe sets Ross up on a date with her friend, Bonnie (Christine Taylor), inciting Rachel's jealousy. She tries sabotaging the relationship by coercing Bonnie to shave her head bald, and eventually admits to Ross that she still has feelings for him. The season closes with Ross having to choose between Rachel and Bonnie.\n\n\n\n### Season 4[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 4)\n\nIn the season 4 premiere, after Ross breaks up with Bonnie, he and Rachel briefly reconcile after Ross pretends to read a long letter that Rachel wrote for him. However, Ross continues to insist that the two were on a break when he slept with Chloe, so they break up again. Joey dates Kathy (Paget Brewster), a girl that Chandler has a crush on. Kathy and Chandler later kiss, which causes drama between Chandler and Joey. Joey only forgives Chandler and allows him to date Kathy after Chandler spends Thanksgiving in a box as punishment.\n\n\nChandler's relationship with Kathy ends after he discovers that she cheated on him due to an argument. Phoebe loses her job as a masseuse after making out with one of her clients and she accompanies Monica, who has become a caterer for hire. They soon start a catering business together but Monica, after negatively reviewing a restaurant, Allesandro's, is offered the position of head chef. Despite initially being pressured by the wrath of her co-workers, Monica eventually asserts her dominance in the kitchen. Phoebe becomes a surrogate for her brother and his wife, Alice (Debra Jo Rupp).\n\n\nMonica and Rachel are forced to switch apartments with Joey and Chandler after losing a bet during a quiz game, but manage to switch back by bribing them with Knicks season tickets and a one-minute kiss (off-screen) between each other. After her boss dies, Rachel is demoted to personal shopping and meets and later dates a customer named Joshua (Tate Donovan). Ross begins dating an English woman named Emily (Helen Baxendale), and they quickly get engaged. Rachel struggles to cope and hastily suggests to Joshua that they marry, after which he rejects her. In the season finale, the group, apart from a heavily pregnant Phoebe and Rachel, travel to Ross and Emily's wedding in London. Chandler and Monica sleep together, and Rachel, realizing that she is still in love with Ross, rushes to London to stop Ross and Emily's wedding, but changes her mind when she sees them happy together. While saying his vows, Ross accidentally says Rachel's name at the altar, shocking his bride and the guests.\n\n\n\n### Season 5[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 5)\n\nRoss and Emily marry, but an angry and humiliated Emily flees the reception.

Ross agrees, but later attends a dinner with all his friends, Rachel included. Emily phones Ross, discovers Rachel is there, realizes she does not trust him and ends their marriage.

Ross promises Rachel he will get them an annulment, then secretly does nothing because he cannot face having three failed marriages. By the time Rachel discovers they are still married, an annulment is impossible due to their history; they are forced to get a divorce. After ignoring the numerous signs that they should get married, Monica and Chandler decide to live together, forcing Rachel to move in with Phoebe. Joey gets a new roommate, Janine (Elle Macpherson).\n\n\nThey develop feelings for each other and date briefly until Janine criticizes Monica and Chandler, ending the relationship. After Janine moves out, Joey struggles with paying his bills so he takes a job at Central Perk. He soon lands a role on a cable TV series called *Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.*, starring alongside a crime-fighting robot. Ross gets a teaching job at New York University. He dates Elizabeth (Alexandra Holden), a student, despite it being against university policy. Elizabeth's father, Paul (Bruce Willis), disapproves of Ross but falls for Rachel, and they start dating.\n\n\nBoth relationships soon end: Elizabeth is too immature for Ross, and previously reserved Paul opens up emotionally and is more than Rachel can handle. Phoebe and Rachel's apartment catches fire, and Rachel moves in with Joey, while Phoebe stays with Chandler and Monica, though they later switch. While at a museum that has a two-year wait for weddings, Monica puts her name on the reservation list as a joke. When Chandler intercepts the museum's phone call about a cancellation, he panics; however, Chandler has been planning to propose while pretending he may never want to marry.\n\n\nWhile dining at a fancy restaurant, Chandler's planned proposal is subverted by Monica's ex-boyfriend Richard Burke, who unexpectedly shows up. Richard later tells Monica he wants to marry her and have children. Monica becomes upset at Chandler, believing his ruse about not wanting to marry. Chandler believes Monica has left him until he comes home to find their apartment decorated with candles and her waiting to propose to him. When she becomes too emotional to continue, Chandler proposes and she accepts.\n\n\n\n### Season 7[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 7)\n\nThe seventh season mainly follows Monica and Chandler as they plan their wedding amid various problems. Joey's television series, *Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E* is canceled, but he is offered his old role on *Days of Our Lives*; the show is retconned with the revelation that Dr. Drake Ramoray has been in a four-year coma and is revived with a brain transplant from another character. Phoebe's repaired apartment now has one large bedroom instead of the original two, so Rachel permanently stays at Joey's. Rachel is promoted at Ralph Lauren and impulsively hires a young assistant, Tag Jones (Eddie Cahill), based on his looks, passing over a more qualified woman. Tag discovers her feelings about him at Thanksgiving dinner, and they begin dating, hiding it from co-workers. However, on her 30th birthday, Rachel ends their relationship, realizing Tag is too young and immature, particularly if she intends to follow her marriage schedule.\n\n\nHours before Monica and Chandler's wedding ceremony, Chandler panics and goes into hiding just as Phoebe and Rachel find a positive pregnancy test in Monica and Chandler's bathroom. They assume Monica is pregnant. Ross and Phoebe find Chandler and convince him to return for the ceremony, though he briefly bolts again after overhearing Phoebe and Rachel discussing the pregnancy test. He quickly returns, embracing the idea of fatherhood. After the ceremony, Monica denies she is pregnant; unbeknown to everyone, the positive pregnancy test is Rachel's.\n\n\n\n### Season 8[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 8)\n\nSeason 8 begins at Monica and Chandler's wedding reception. Phoebe and Monica discover Rachel's pregnancy and persuade her to take another test to confirm it. Phoebe initially claims the test is negative, badly disappointing Rachel, then reveals it is positive, saying Rachel now knows how she really feels about having a baby. Ross is eventually revealed to be the father, and the season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy. Rachel and Ross agree to be co-parents without resuming their romantic relationship; Ross begins dating Mona (Bonnie Somerville), who is Monica's co-worker from Allesandro's.\n\n\nJoey takes Rachel out to quell her fears about motherhood, and realizes he has romantic feelings for her. While suppressing his feelings, he encourages Rachel to stay at Ross's apartment so he can be involved in the pregnancy. The arrangement is too much for Mona, and she breaks up with Ross. Joey tells Ross about his feelings for Rachel. Ross initially is angry, then gives his blessing. Joey tells Rachel that he loves her, but she realizes she does not feel the same way, and they remain friends. When Rachel goes into labor, Ross's mother gives him a family heirloom ring and encourages him to propose to Rachel. Ross hesitates, and puts the ring in his jacket, which he later leaves in Rachel's room.\n\n\nAfter Monica jokes about having kids, she and Chandler decide to have a baby, starting while they are still at the hospital. After a prolonged labor, during which numerous other expectant mothers, including Janice, are taken to the delivery room, Rachel gives birth to baby Emma. She is left saddened and afraid after Janice later says that Ross may not always be there for her and the baby. When Joey comforts Rachel, the ring falls from Ross's jacket to the floor. Joey kneels to pick it up, and Rachel, believing he is proposing, impulsively says yes. Meanwhile, Ross intends to ask Rachel if she wants to resume their relationship.\n\n\n\n### Season 9[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 9)\n\nSeason nine begins with Ross and Rachel cohabitating with their daughter Emma, after Joey and Rachel clear up the proposal misunderstanding. Monica and Chandler run into obstacles as they try for a baby: Chandler unknowingly agrees to a work transfer to Tulsa just as Monica is offered a head chef job at a new restaurant, Javu, resulting in Chandler commuting back and forth. After being apart from Monica during Christmas, Chandler quits to pursue a new career in advertising, starting as an unpaid intern at an ad agency, and eventually being hired as a junior copywriter. Monica and Chandler discover they are physically incompatible to conceive and after considering multiple options, decide to adopt.\n\n\nPhoebe begins dating Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd) for most of the season until Mike says that he never wants to marry again. Phoebe dates her ex-boyfriend from season 1, David (Hank Azaria) who plans on proposing to her, but Mike proposes first. Phoebe rejects both proposals but gets back together with Mike, only needing the reassurance that they have a future together. Rachel, believing that her co-worker Gavin (Dermot Mulroney) is trying to steal her job while she is on maternity leave, returns to Ralph Lauren early. She discovers at her birthday party that Gavin has feelings for her. They kiss but do not pursue a relationship due to her history with Ross.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Ross, having seen the kiss, retaliates by dating other women. After realizing that her and Ross's living situation is too weird, Rachel and Emma move in with Joey. Rachel develops a crush on him, only to be disheartened when he starts dating Charlie (Aisha Tyler), a new palaeontology professor to whom Ross is attracted. In the finale, the group travels to Barbados for Ross's keynote speech at a conference. Joey and Charlie break up upon realizing they have nothing in common. Joey then learns about Rachel's feelings for him, but says they cannot pursue this because of Ross. However, upon seeing Ross and Charlie kiss each other, he goes to Rachel's hotel room, and the finale ends with them kissing.\n\n\n\n### Season 10[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 10)\n\nThe tenth season brings several long-running story lines to a close. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross's feelings about their relationship, and after disastrous attempts to consummate, decide it is best they remain friends. Charlie breaks up with Ross to get back together with her ex-boyfriend. Mid-season, Joey officiates Phoebe and Mike's wedding outside the Central Perk coffee house after a snow storm paralyzes the city, preventing them and guests getting to the wedding venue. Monica and Chandler are chosen by a pregnant woman named Erica (Anna Faris) to adopt her baby.\n\n\nFollowing this, Monica and Chandler prepare to move to a house in the suburbs to raise their family, saddening everyone, particularly Joey, who is coping with all the changes in his life. In the series finale, Erica gives birth to fraternal twins, much to Monica and Chandler's surprise. Rachel is fired from Ralph Lauren after her boss overhears her interviewing for a job at Gucci. She encounters her former Bloomingdale co-worker Mark, who offers her a new job at Louis Vuitton in Paris. Ross, believing Rachel wants to stay, tries bribing Mr. Zelner to rehire her until he realizes Rachel wants to go to Paris. When Rachel says a tearful personal goodbye to everyone except Ross at her going away party, a hurt and angry Ross confronts Rachel, and they end up sleeping together.\n\n\nRachel leaves, and Ross – realizing how much he loves Rachel – chases her to the airport. When he reaches her, Rachel says she has to go to Paris. Before the plane takes off, Rachel calls Ross's home phone and leaves a voice mail, apologizing for the way it ended. While speaking, she realizes that she loves him too, and gets off the plane at the last minute. The series ends with all the friends, plus Monica and Chandler's new babies, leaving the empty apartment together for a final cup of coffee at Central Perk. The show ends first with a shot of everyone's keys to Monica and Chandler's apartment left on the counter top, and then pans to a shot of the apartment's purple door.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Conception[edit]\n\n\n\n> It's about sex, love, relationships, careers, a time in your life when everything's possible. And it's about friendship because when you're single and in the city, your friends are your family.\n> \n> — The original treatment used by Crane, Kauffman and Bright to pitch the series to NBC.[49]\n> \n\n\nDavid Crane and Marta Kauffman began developing three new television pilots that would premiere in 1994 after their sitcom *Family Album* was cancelled by CBS in 1993.[50] Kauffman and Crane decided to pitch the series about \"six people in their 20s making their way in Manhattan\" to NBC since they thought it would fit best there.[51] (Film director and screenwriter Cameron Crowe has asserted that the concept originated with Warner Bros. Television wanting him to make his 1992 movie *Singles* into a television show.[52][53] Crowe alleges that when he refused permission, the idea was then taken over by Crane and Kaufman, who changed some details from the premise of the movie while developing the show.[52][53])\n\n\nCrane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series *Dream On*.[54] The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed they were looking at a time when the future was \"more of a question mark.\"[49] They found the concept to be interesting, as they believed \"everybody knows that feeling\",[49] and because it was also how they felt about their own lives at the time.[49] The team titled the series *Insomnia Cafe* and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to NBC in December 1993.[49][51]\n\n\nAt the same time, Warren Littlefield, the then-president of NBC Entertainment, was seeking a comedy involving young people living together and sharing expenses. Littlefield wanted the group to share memorable periods of their lives with friends, who had become \"new, surrogate family members.\"[19] However, Littlefield found difficulty in bringing the concept to life and found the scripts developed by NBC to be terrible. When Kauffman, Crane and Bright pitched *Insomnia Cafe*, Littlefield was impressed that they knew who their characters were.[19] NBC bought the idea as a put pilot, meaning they risked financial penalties if the pilot was not filmed.[55]\n\n\nKauffman and Crane took three days to write the pilot script for a show they titled *Friends Like Us.*[49][56] Littlefield wanted the series to \"represent Generation X and explore a new kind of tribal bonding\", but the rest disagreed. Crane argued that it was not a series for one generation, and wanted to produce a series that everyone would enjoy watching.[19] NBC liked the script and ordered the series. They changed the title to *Six of One*, mainly because they felt *Friends Like Us* was too similar to the ABC sitcom *These Friends of Mine*.[57]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Pilot (Friends)\n\n![](image)The producers wanted Courteney Cox (*pictured*) to portray Rachel; however, Cox wanted to play Monica and co-creator Marta Kauffman agreed after watching the audition.\nOnce it became apparent that the series was a favored project at NBC, Littlefield reported that he was getting calls from every agent in town, wanting their client to be a part of the series.[19] Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles.[58] The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75. Those who received a callback read in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright. At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and these actors were asked to read for Les Moonves, then president of Warner Bros. Television.[59]\n\n\nHaving worked with David Schwimmer in the past,[58] the series creators wrote the character of Ross with him in mind, and he was the first actor cast.[60] Cox wanted to play the role of Monica because she liked the \"strong\" character, but the producers had her in mind to play Rachel because of her \"cheery, upbeat energy\", which was not how they envisioned Monica; after Cox's audition, though, Kauffman agreed with Cox, and she got the role.[49][61] When Matt LeBlanc auditioned for Joey, he put a \"different spin\" on the character.[49] He played Joey more simple-minded than intended and gave the character heart. Although Crane and Kauffman did not want LeBlanc for the role at the time, they were told by the network to cast him.[49] Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow were cast based on their auditions.[58] Perry and Aniston, both still under contract to other shows that year, were cast days before shooting of the pilot began.[62]\n\n\nMore changes occurred to the series's storylines during the casting process. The writers found that they had to adjust the characters they had written to suit the actors, and the discovery process of the characters occurred throughout the first season. Kauffman acknowledged that Joey's character became \"this whole new being\", and that \"it wasn't until we did the first Thanksgiving episode that we realized how much fun Monica's neuroses are.\"[63]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nIn the weeks after NBC's pick up of *Friends*, Crane, Kauffman and Bright reviewed sent-in scripts that writers had originally prepared for other series, mainly unproduced *Seinfeld* episodes.[64] Kauffman and Crane hired a team of seven young writers because \"When you're 40, you can't do it anymore. The networks and studios are looking for young people coming in out of college.\"[65] The creators felt that using six equal characters, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for \"myriad storylines and give the show legs.\"[30] The majority of the storyline ideas came from the writers, although the actors added ideas.[58] Although the writers originally planned the big love story to be between Joey and Monica, the idea of a romantic interest between Ross and Rachel emerged during the period when Kauffman and Crane wrote the pilot script.[49]\n\n\nDuring the production of the pilot, NBC requested that the script be changed to feature one dominant storyline and several minor ones, but the writers refused, wanting to keep three storylines of equal weight.[57] NBC also wanted the writers to include an older character to balance out the young ones. Crane and Kauffman were forced to comply and wrote a draft of an early episode that featured \"Pat the Cop\". who would be used to provide advice to the other characters. Crane found the storyline to be terrible, and Kauffman joked, \"You know the kids [*sic*] book, *Pat the Bunny*? We had Pat the Cop.\" NBC eventually relented and dropped the idea.[49]\n\n\nEach summer, the producers would outline the storylines for the subsequent season.[66] Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign.[64] The hardest episodes to write were always \"the first one and the last one of each season.\"[67] Unlike other storylines, the idea for a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel.[66]\n\n\nThe storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none.[66] Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.[63]\n\n\nThe episode title format—\"The One ...\"[68]—was created when the producers realized that the episode titles would not be featured in the opening credits, and therefore would be unknown to most of the audience. Episode titles officially begin with \"The One ...\" except the title of the pilot episode and the series finale \"The Last One\". The season 5 episode \"The One Hundredth\" has the alternative title of \"The One With The Triplet\".\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Greenwich Village building, 90 Bedford Street, used as the friends' apartment block in establishing shots\nThe first season was shot on Stage 5 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.[69] NBC executives had worried that the coffee house setting was too hip and asked for the series to be set in a diner, but eventually consented to the coffee house concept.[49] The opening title sequence was filmed in a fountain at the Warner Bros. Ranch at 4:00 am, while it was particularly cold for a Burbank morning.[70] At the beginning of the second season, production moved to the larger Stage 24, which was renamed The \"Friends\" Stage after the series finale.[71]\n\n\nFilming for the series began during the summer of 1994 in front of a live audience, who were given a summary of the series to familiarize themselves with the six main characters.[49] A hired comedian entertained the studio audience between takes.[33] Each 22-minute episode took six hours to film—twice the length of most sitcom tapings—mainly due to the several retakes and rewrites of the script.[33]\n\n\nAlthough the producers always wanted to find the right stories to take advantage of being on location, *Friends* was never shot in New York. Bright felt that filming outside the studio made episodes less funny, even when shooting on the lot outside, and that the live audience was an integral part of the series.[58] When the series was criticized for incorrectly depicting New York, with the financially struggling group of friends being able to afford huge apartments, Bright noted that the set had to be big enough for the cameras, lighting, and \"for the audience to be able to see what's going on\".[58] The apartments also needed to provide a place for the actors to execute the actions in the scripts.[58]\n\n\nThe fourth-season finale was shot on location in London because the producers were aware of the series' popularity in the UK.[58] The scenes were shot in a studio with three audiences each made up of 500 people. These were the show's largest audiences throughout its run. The fifth-season finale, set in Las Vegas, was filmed at Warner Bros. Studios, although Bright met people who thought it was filmed on location.[72]\n\n\n\n## Series finale[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Last One (Friends)\n\n![](image)The cast became very emotional while filming the final episode. Jennifer Aniston explained, \"We're like very delicate china right now, and we're speeding toward a brick wall.\"[73]\nThe series's creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in January 2004, four months before its original airing. Crane, Kauffman and Bright watched the finales of other sitcoms to prepare the episode's outline, paying attention to what worked and what did not. They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, citing the finale of *The Mary Tyler Moore Show* as the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale. They did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\"[74] The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience and with a minimum number of crew members. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly:[74]\n\n\n\n\n> It's exactly what I had hoped. We all end up with a sense of a new beginning and the audience has a sense that it's a new chapter in the lives of all these characters. \n> \n> — David Schwimmer on the series finale.[74]\n> \n\n\nNBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype.[75] Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen.[76] The finale was the subject of two episodes of *Dateline NBC*, one of which ran for two hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before the airing of the episode. Following the finale, *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno* was filmed on the set of the *Friends*' Central Perk coffee house, which featured the cast as guests.[77][78] The advertising rates for the finale averaged $2 million for 30 seconds of commercial time, breaking the record held by the *Seinfeld* finale at $1.7 million.[76]\n\n\nIn the U.S., 52.5 million viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast since the *Seinfeld* finale in 1998.[77] The finale was the fifth most-watched series finale in television history, only behind the finales of *M\\*A\\*S\\*H*, *Cheers*, *The Fugitive*, and *Seinfeld*, which were respectively watched by 105, 80.4, 78.0 and 76.3 million viewers.[79] The retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36 million viewers, and the finale was the second most-watched television broadcast of the year in the United States, only behind the Super Bowl.[77] Following the finales of *Friends* and *Frasier*, media critics speculated about the fate of the sitcom genre. Opinions varied between a signalling of the end of the sitcom genre, a small decline in the large history of the genre,[76] and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows.[75]\n\n\n\n## Reunion special[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends: The Reunion\n\nOn November 12, 2019, *The Hollywood Reporter* announced that Warner Bros TV was developing a *Friends* reunion for HBO Max that would feature the whole cast and creators returning.[80] On February 21, 2020, HBO confirmed that the unscripted reunion special, tentatively named \"The One Where They Got Back Together\", was set to be released in May the same year, along with the 236 original episodes of the series.[81][82] On March 18, 2020, it was announced that the special, which was set to film on the *Friends* stage on March 23 and 24, had been postponed indefinitely, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[83] In November 2020, Matthew Perry tweeted that the reunion is set to start filming in March 2021.[84][85] On May 13, 2021, a teaser trailer was released officially announcing *Friends*: The Reunion also known as \"The One Where They Get Back Together\". The reunion special was released on HBO Max on May 27, 2021.[86]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nEarly reviews of the series were mixed; the first season holds a Metacritic score of 65 out of 100, based on 24 sampled reviews, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[87] Tom Feran of *The Plain Dealer* wrote that the series traded \"vaguely and less successfully on the hanging-out style of *Seinfeld*\",[88] while Ann Hodges of the *Houston Chronicle* called it \"the new *Seinfeld* wannabe, but it will never be as funny as *Seinfeld*.\"[89] In the *Los Angeles Daily News*, Ray Richmond named the series as \"one of the brighter comedies of the new season\",[90] and the *Los Angeles Times* called it \"flat-out the best comedy series of the new season.\"[91]\n\n\nThe *Chicago Sun-Times*' Ginny Holbert found Joey and Rachel's characters to be underdeveloped,[92] while Richmond commended the cast as a \"likeable youth ensemble\" with \"good chemistry.\"[90] Robert Bianco of *USA Today* was complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him \"terrific.\" He also praised the female leads, but was concerned that Perry's role as Chandler was \"undefined\" and that LeBlanc was \"relying too much on the same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it.\"[93] The authors of *Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends* thought that the cast was \"trying just a little too hard\"; in particular, Perry and Schwimmer.[94]\n\n\nAs the series progressed, reviews became more positive, and *Friends* became one of the most popular sitcoms of its time. It is now often ranked among the all-time best TV shows.[9][11][12] Critics commended the series for having consistently sharp writing and for the chemistry between the main actors.[95] Noel Holston of *Newsday*, who had dismissed the pilot as a \"so-so *Seinfeld* wannabe\" in 1994, repudiated his earlier review after rewatching the episode and felt like writing an apology to the writers.[63] Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com thought that the series \"hit its stride\" in the second season. Havrilesky found the character-specific jokes and situations \"could reliably make you laugh out loud a few times each episode\", and the quality of writing allowed the stories to be \"original and innovative.\"[96]\n\n\nBill Carter of *The New York Times* called the eighth season a \"truly stunning comeback.\" Carter found that by \"generating new hot storylines and high-decibel laughs\", the series made its way \"back into the hearts of its fans.\"[97] However, Liane Bonin of *Entertainment Weekly* felt that the direction of the ninth season was a \"disappointing buzzkill\", criticizing it for the non-stop celebrity guest spots and going into jump the shark territory. Although disappointed with the season, Bonin noted that \"the writing [was] still sharp.\"[98] Havrilesky thought that the tenth season was \"alarmingly awful, far worse than you would ever imagine a show that was once so good could be.\"[96] *Friends* was featured on *Time*'s list of \"The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time\", saying, \"the well-hidden secret of this show was that it called itself *Friends*, and was really about family.\"[99]\n\n\nReviews of the series finale were mostly positive. *USA Today*'s Robert Bianco described the finale as entertaining and satisfying and praised it for deftly mixing emotion and humor while highlighting each of the stars.[100] Sarah Rodman of the *Boston Herald* praised Aniston and Schwimmer for their acting, but felt that their characters' reunion was \"a bit too neat, even if it was what most of the show's legions of fans wanted.\"[101] Roger Catlin of the *Hartford Courant* felt that newcomers to the series would be \"surprised at how laughless the affair could be, and how nearly every strained gag depends on the sheer stupidity of its characters.\"[102] Ken Parish Perkins, writing for *Fort Worth Star-Telegram*, pointed out that the finale was \"more touching than comical, more satisfying in terms of closure than knee-slappingly funny.\"[103]\n\n\n\n\n> It may have been impossible for any one episode to live up to the hype and expectations built up around the Friends finale, but this hour probably came as close as fans could have reasonably hoped. Ultimately, the two-hour package did exactly what it was supposed to do. It wrapped up the story while reminding us why we liked the show and will miss it.\n> \n> — Robert Bianco of *USA Today* on the series finale.[100]\n> \n\n\nIn a 2021 program on ITV, *Mr. Bean* writer Richard Curtis accused the *Friends* writers of stealing the joke which involved Joey getting a turkey stuck on his head in \"The One with All the Thanksgivings\" from the 1992 episode \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean\". In that episode, Mr Bean got a turkey stuck on his head after losing his watch while stuffing the turkey and put his head in to try and retrieve it. Rowan Atkinson, however, argued that jokes are meant to be stolen, or to inspire.[104]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Friends\n\nTo maintain the series's ensemble format, the main cast members decided to enter themselves in the same acting categories for awards.[32] Beginning with the eighth season, the actors decided to submit themselves in the lead actor balloting, rather than in the supporting actor fields.[105] The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards,[106] winning six.\n\n\nAniston and Kudrow are the only main cast members to win an Emmy, while Cox is the only actor not to be nominated. The series won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2002, receiving nominations in 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, and 2003.[107] The series also won an American Comedy Award,[108] one GLAAD Media Award,[109] one Golden Globe Award,[110] three Logie Awards,[111][112] six People's Choice Awards,[113][114] one Satellite Award,[115] and one Screen Actors Guild Award.[116]\n\n\n\n### Ratings[edit]\n\n\nThe table below shows the ratings of *Friends* in the United States, where it consistently ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings.[117] \"Rank\" refers to how well *Friends* rated compared to other television series that aired during primetime hours of the corresponding television season. It is shown in relation to the total number of series airing on the then-six major English-language networks in a given season. \"Viewers\" refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes, broadcast during the television season in the series' regular timeslot. The \"season premiere\" is the date that the first episode of the season aired, and the \"season finale\" is the date that the final episode of the season aired. Following the September 11 attacks, ratings increased 17% over the previous season.[97]\n\n\n\n\n\nRatings table\n| Season\n | Timeslot\n | Season premiere\n | Season finale\n | TV season\n | Rank\n | Viewers(in millions)\n | Most-watched episode\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Title\n | Viewers(in millions)\n |\n| 1 | Thursday 8:30 pm  (1–16)  Thursday 9:30 pm  (17–24) | September 22, 1994\n | May 18, 1995\n | 1994–95 | 8 | 24.3[117] | \"The One Where Rachel Finds Out\"\n | 31.3[118] |\n| 2 | Thursday 8:00 pm\n | September 21, 1995\n | May 16, 1996\n | 1995–96 | 3 | 30[117] | \"The One After the Superbowl\"\n | 52.9[118] |\n| 3 | September 19, 1996\n | May 15, 1997\n | 1996–97 | 4 | 24.9[117] | \"The One Where Chandler Can't Remember Which Sister\"\n | 29.80[119] |\n| 4 | September 25, 1997\n | May 7, 1998\n | 1997–98 | 4 | 24.0[117] | \"The One with Ross's Wedding\"\n | 31.61[120] |\n| 5 | September 24, 1998\n | May 20, 1999\n | 1998–99 | 2 | 23.5[117] | \"The One After Ross Says Rachel\"\n | 31.12[121] |\n| 6 | September 23, 1999\n | May 18, 2000\n | 1999–2000 | 5 | 20.7[117] | \"The One with the Proposal\"\n | 30.73[122] |\n| 7 | October 12, 2000\n | May 17, 2001\n | 2000–01 | 5 | 20.2[117] | \"The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding\"\n | 30.05[123] |\n| 8 | September 27, 2001\n | May 16, 2002\n | 2001–02 | 1 | 24.5[117] | \"The One Where Rachel Has a Baby\"\n | 34.91[124] |\n| 9 | September 26, 2002\n | May 15, 2003\n | 2002–03 | 2 | 21.8[117] | \"The One Where No One Proposes\"\n | 34.01[125] |\n| 10 | September 25, 2003\n | May 6, 2004\n | 2003–04 | 4 | 22.8[117] | \"The Last One\"\n | 52.46[126] |\n\n\n### Syndication[edit]\n\n\nBecause of syndication revenue, *Friends* continues to generate approximately $1 billion each year for Warner Bros. That translates into about $20 million in annual residuals each for Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, who each get 2% of syndication income for *Friends*.[127]\n\n\nAll episodes became available on Netflix on January 1, 2015, introducing a new generation to the show. UK *Friends* reruns' ratings in 2015 increased by more than 10% annually. The 2016 reruns' US weekly audience, not including streaming, of 16 million would make it a hit on network television were the show still being produced.[128] In the US, the series has a syndication deal through multiple networks, including Nick at Nite, TBS, and Paramount Network. In July 2019, it was announced that from the beginning of 2020, *Friends* would not be available on Netflix in the US and instead would be shown on Warner Bros. Discovery's video-streaming service HBO Max,[129] which launched in May 2020.[130]\n\n\n\n## Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The set of Central Perk at Warner Bros. Studios\nAlthough the producers thought of *Friends* as \"only a TV show\", psychologists investigated the cultural impact of *Friends* during the series' run. Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed \"The Rachel\" and copied around the world.[19] Joey's catchphrase, \"How *you* doin'?\", became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends.[131] The series also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word \"*so*\" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier. Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change.[31] Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech.[132]\n\n\n*Friends* has also been credited in helping non-English speaking students to learn the language. A 2012 poll by Kaplan International English Colleges found that more than a quarter (26%) of its students cited the sitcom as the best show for helping them improve their English.[133] Notable individuals who have also said that the sitcom helped them learn English include Liverpool F.C. manager Jürgen Klopp,[134] BTS member RM[135] and Belgian professional golfer Thomas Pieters.[136]\n\n\n*Friends* was parodied in the twelfth season *Murder, She Wrote* episode \"Murder Among Friends\". In the episode, amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) investigates the murder of a writer for *Buds*, a fictional television series about the daily lives of a group of city friends. The episode was devised after CBS moved *Murder, She Wrote* from its regular Sunday night timeslot to a Thursday night timeslot directly opposite *Friends* on NBC; Angela Lansbury was quoted by Bruce Lansbury, her brother and *Murder, She Wrote*'s supervising producer, as having \"a bit of an attitude\" about the move to Thursday, but he saw the plot as \"a friendly setup, no mean-spiritedness.\"[137]\n\n\nJerry Ludwig, the writer of the episode, researched the \"flavor\" of *Buds* by watching episodes of *Friends*.[137] Producers of *Married... with Children* attempted to create a spinoff series called *Enemies*, which was intended to act as an antithesis to *Friends* in the same way *Married... with Children* had been to family sitcoms such as *The Cosby Show*. However, the Fox network declined to pick up the series.[138]\n\n\nThe Central Perk coffee house, one of the principal settings of the series, is part of the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood. People sometimes propose marriage on the couch, and many tourists cry when they sit on it.[128] The coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide. In 2006, Iranian businessman Mojtaba Asadian started a Central Perk franchise, registering the name in 32 countries. The decor of the coffee houses is inspired by *Friends*, featuring replica couches, counters, neon signage and bricks. The coffee houses contain paintings of the various characters from the series, and televisions playing *Friends* episodes. James Michael Tyler, who plays the Central Perk manager in the series, Gunther, attended the grand opening of the Dubai café, where he worked as a waiter.[139]\n\n\nCentral Perk was rebuilt as part of a museum exhibit at Warner Bros. Studios and was shown on *The Ellen DeGeneres Show* in October 2008. Jennifer Aniston visited the set for the first time since the series finale in 2004.[140] From September 24 to October 7, 2009, a Central Perk replica was based at Broadwick Street, Soho, London. The coffee house sold coffee to customers and featured a display of *Friends* memorabilia and props, such as the Geller Cup from the season three episode \"The One with the Football\".[141] In Beijing, business owner Du Xin opened a coffee shop named Central Perk in March 2010.[142]\n\n\n\n![](image)After filming on the finale concluded, Stage 24 at Warner Bros Studios, where *Friends* had been filmed since Season 2, was renamed \"The Friends Stage\".\nIn India, there are six *Friends*-themed cafes, located in Chandigarh (named Central Perk); Kolkata; and West Bengal (named F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Cafe), which features many icons from the original T.V. series, including Chandler and Joey's ugly dog statue, the orange sofa, the purple door of Monica and Rachel's apartment, and Phoebe's pink bicycle. The other three cafes are located in Delhi, Gurgaon; Bhubaneswar, Odisha; and Pune, Maharashtra.[143][144]\n\n\nThere are two *Friends* themed cafes in Pakistan—one in Lahore, Punjab, known as \"Friends Cafe\" and the other in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa called \"Central Perk\". Both cafes have an iconic couch, a guitar and foosball table, quotes from the show on the walls and episode reruns on a projector. They're planning to have their own Gunther at the bar.[145]\n\n\nIn 2016, a Central Perk replica was opened in Outram, Singapore. It is the only Central Perk that has been given the intellectual property rights by Warner Bros. outside of the United States. The café includes feature walls, replicating the walls of the main characters' apartments and memorabilia and props used on the show.[146][147] In August 2019, it was announced that a Central Perk Lego set would be launched to mark the show's 25 anniversary.[148]\n\n\n*Friends* has also developed an alternative family lifestyle by representing young people who live unconventional domestic lives. It presents the idea that \"all you need are good friends\" and can construct families through choice. The audience is able to identify with the program through the troubles seen on weekly episodes. It portrays a new way of living life and developing relationships which are not normally seen in conventional society.[149] According to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, *Friends* is \"one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture.\" The images of youth and the roles they portray are better defined and represent a lifestyle that centres around creating and sustaining relationships between friends running their own lives and seeking help from each other.[150]\n\n\n\n![](image)The *Friends* Experience exhibit at Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto in 2022[151]\n*Vox* stated that *Friends* had an impact on the creation of other conflictless \"hangout sitcoms\", with groups of adult friends who are funny and have similar character traits. One example of this is *How I Met Your Mother*, which *The Guardian*'s TV and radio blog notes also shares its setting with *Friends*, Manhattan. Other examples include *The Big Bang Theory*, *New Girl*, and *Happy Endings*.[152][153][154][155]\n\n\nReaders of *TV Guide* voted the cast of *Friends* their Best Comedy cast of all time, ranking at 29% of the votes, beating *Seinfeld*, which registered 18%.[156] A poll undertaken by *60 Minutes* and *Vanity Fair* named *Friends* the third-greatest sitcom of all time.[157] In 2014, the series was ranked by *Mundo Estranho* the Best TV Series of All Time.[158] A 2015 survey by *The Hollywood Reporter* of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named *Friends* as their No. 1 favorite show.[159]\n\n\n\n## Distribution[edit]\n\n\n### Broadcast[edit]\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nAfter the produced pilot lived up to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name *Friends* on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30 p.m. time slot. The pilot aired between *Mad About You* and *Seinfeld*,[19] and was watched by almost 22 million American viewers.[3] The series was a huge success throughout its run and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV.[160] When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing and that at least two of the cast members would not sign on for another season.[97] When it was confirmed that *Friends* would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7 million per episode—that it took to bring the series back for another season.[97]\n\n\nAfter year-long expectations that the ninth season would be the series's last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team did not want to extend negotiations into the next year and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale.[161] NBC agreed to pay $10 million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series.[95] Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series.[161] The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.[98]\n\n\nIn fall 2001, Warner Bros. Domestic Cable made a deal with sister network TBS (both were owned by Time Warner) to air the series in rerun syndication. Warner Bros. Domestic Cable announced that it had sold additional cable rights to *Friends* to Nick at Nite which began airing in the fall of 2011 (unlike the TBS and broadcast syndication airings, Nick at Nite broadcasts of the series, which began airing as part of a seven-night launch marathon on September 5, 2011, replace the end credit tag scenes with marginalized credits featuring promotions for the series and other Nick at Nite programs). Warner Bros. was expected to make $200 million in license fees and advertising from the deal. Nick at Nite paid $500,000 per episode to air the episodes after 6 pm. ET for six years through fall 2017. In syndication until 2005, *Friends* had earned $4 million per episode in cash license fees for a total of $944 million.[162]\n\n\nComedy Central began airing reruns of *Friends* in October 2019.\n\n\n\n#### International[edit]\n\n\nHaving already made huge success in the United States, *Friends* producers decided to air the show in Europe. It premiered in the United Kingdom on April 28, 1995.[163] Season 1 was broadcast until September 1995 on Channel 4 at 9:30 PM on Friday nights, and immediately was a success. The popularity of the show allowed the theme song by the Rembrandts to hit number 3 on the UK Singles Charts in September 1995.[164]\n\n\nThe popularity of the show in Britain led to an episode being produced in London at the end of the fourth season, starring British actress Helen Baxendale, who became a leading cast member in seasons four and five during her character's relationship with Ross. The show has since aired on different channels in the UK in their original, unedited international versions prior to their being re-edited for US broadcast and syndication. These versions, with additional footage not seen domestically, have aired on such stations as Channel 4, Sky1, E4, and Comedy Central UK.[165][166][167][168][169]\n\n\nIn September 2011, *Friends* officially ended on E4 after the channel re-ran the series since 2004. Comedy Central took over the rights to air the program from October 2011. Since 2018 Channel 5 started airing the program. In the Republic of Ireland, each season of the show made its European debut on RTÉ2. After 2004 RTÉ2 began to repeat the series from the start before moving over to TV3 and its digital channel 3e in 2010.[170][171] As of February 2015[update], repeats of the show have returned to RTÉ2 while also broadcasting on Comedy Central Ireland.[172][173]\n\n\nSeason 10's finale in the UK, broadcast on May 28, 2004, was on Channel 4. It was broadcast from 9 pm to 10 pm and attracted *Friends'* largest UK audiences. It attracted almost 10 million viewers, and is currently standing at Number 10 in Channel 4's most-watched shows. *Big Brother* was moved to 10 pm, which *Friends* had beaten. *Friends* got 9.6 million viewers at 9 pm, while *Big Brother 5*'s launch attracted 7.2 million viewers at 10 pm, which is the most-watched premiere on UK TV ever. However, on January 3, 2007, *Celebrity Big Brother 5*'s launch was watched by 7.3 million viewers, and its eviction on January 19, 2007, was watched by 8.7 million viewers.\n\n\n*Friends* has previously aired in Australia on the Seven Network (season 1), Nine Network (season 2–10), Network Ten (2007–09, repeats), Arena, 111 Hits, 9Gem (2012–2018, repeats), and TVHits. It currently airs on 10 Peach and on pay TV channel Fox Comedy, both of which broadcast the high-definition version of the series.[174][175] The show is broadcast on TV2 in New Zealand.[176]\n\n\nIn Canada, the series was broadcast on Global. In later years, it was syndicated on several of its cable sibling networks, including Slice, DTour, and TVTropolis, its previous incarnation.[177][178] The series is now syndicated to Bell Media owned CTV Comedy Channel.\n\n\nIn Latin America, the first seven seasons aired on Sony, and the remaining seasons on Warner.[179] In Brazil, free-to-air networks RedeTV! and SBT also aired a few seasons.\n\n\nIn India, the show is broadcast by Comedy Central at various times. It is the most-watched English language show in the country.[180]\n\n\nIn the Philippines, the show was originally aired on ABC-5[181][182]\nfrom 1996 to 2005 and ETC from 2005 to 2014.\n\n\nIn Greece, the show was broadcast on Star Channel.[183] In Cyprus, *Friends* aired on CyBC 2 while reruns air on TVOne.[184]\n\n\nIn 2022, Bilibili, iQIYI, Tencent Video, and Youku began distributing edited *Friends* episodes in China. These edited versions of episodes removed most LGBT content, not edited in original Chinese airings. Chinese fans of the show reacted negatively online.[185]\n\n\n\n### Remaster[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in March 2012, high definition versions of all 236 *Friends* episodes were made available to local broadcast stations, starting with the pilot episode. For the remastered episodes, Warner Bros. restored previously cropped images on the left and right sides of the screen, using the original 35 mm film source, to use the entire 16:9 widescreen frame. Because the show was not originally filmed for widescreen, but rather filmed in 4-perf format and protected for 4:3, some cropping problems arise in some shots where information from the top and bottom of the frame is removed, and some expanded shots reveal unintentional artifacts, including set edges, boom mics and body doubles replacing some of the main cast.[186]\n\n\nIn early versions of the HD remasters, there were also a few shots, including chroma effects shots, which were sourced from standard-definition videotape sources, as not all of the footage had been located in time for the remaster. The original film sources for these shots were later rescanned for later broadcast and release.[186] These masters had been airing in New Zealand on TV2 since January 2011, and the earlier HD prints continue to air on Comedy Central in the United Kingdom as of 2020.[187] Netflix added all ten seasons of *Friends* in high definition to its streaming service in the United States in January 2015 before the platform discontinued the series in late 2019.\n\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n### Streaming[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Warner Bros. chairman and chief executive officer, Kevin Tsujihara, announced that the company had licensed the North American streaming rights of all ten seasons of *Friends* to Netflix,[188][189] in a deal said to be worth around $500,000 an episode,[190] or about $120 million in total. The show became available on Netflix from January 1, 2015.[191] The Netflix airings are the versions aired on NBC rather than the longer international versions, as discussed below. The series left Netflix in the US on January 1, 2020, as it began streaming on HBO Max on May 27, 2020.[192] The series left Netflix in Canada for Crave on December 31, 2020.[193]\n\n\n\n### Blu-ray and DVD[edit]\n\n\nAll ten seasons have been released on DVD individually and as a box set. Each Region 1 season release contains special features and are presented in their aforementioned original international broadcast versions, although Region 2 releases are as originally aired domestically. For the first season, each episode is updated with color correction and sound enhancement.[58] A wide range of *Friends* merchandise has been produced by various companies. In September 1995, WEA Records released the first album of music from *Friends*, the *Friends Original TV Soundtrack*, containing music featured in previous and future episodes. The soundtrack debuted on the *Billboard* 200 at number 46,[194] and sold 500,000 copies in November 1995.[195]\n\n\nIn 1999, a second soundtrack album entitled *Friends Again* was released.[196] Other merchandise includes a *Friends* version of the DVD game \"Scene It?\", and a quiz video game for PlayStation 2 and PC entitled *Friends: The One with All the Trivia*.[197][198] On September 28, 2009, a box set was released in the UK celebrating the show's 15th anniversary. The box set contained extended episodes, an episode guide, and original special features.[199]\n\n\nWarner Home Video released a complete series collection on Blu-ray on November 13, 2012.[200] The collection does not feature the extra deleted scenes and jokes that were included on prior DVD releases, and are therefore presented in their NBC broadcast versions.\n\n\nIn Australia, the original DVD releases were fold out box sets which contained three discs, and released as follows: Season 1 and Season 2 on March 13, 2002, Season 3 and Season 4 on July 9, 2002, Season 5, 6 and 7 on July 29, 2002, Season 8 on March 18, 2003, Season 9 on February 11, 2004, and Season 10 on November 24, 2004. Repackaged sets, slimmed into regular DVD cases also containing three discs were released from 2003 to 2004. Collector's Edition sets were released from September 9, 2003, through to February 1, 2006, these sets contains 4 discs, in fat DVD cases, with extra bonus material.\n\n\nOn October 4, 2006, the individual seasons were repackaged into regular DVD case sets and marked as \"Including Brand New Bonus Disc\". Once again each individual season were repackaged with new artwork on March 31, 2010. The first complete series boxset on DVD was released around 2004 or 2005, this was titled 'The One With All Ten Seasons\" and the packaging was a black box with a lift up lid and contains exclusive packaging for all ten seasons.\n\n\nThe second complete series boxset was released August 21, 2013 and was a red box which contained the 2010 individual season sets inside. On October 1, 2014, was the 20th Anniversary boxset, this was a white box and contained the same 2010 individual releases inside. On October 7, 2015, another boxset was released 'The One With All Ten Seasons\", the same name used on the original boxset, however this time slimmed down and contains the 2010 individual releases inside. The outer box is open on insert side for the cases to slide in and out, more of a budget release. In 2016, a repackaged 'The Complete Series' Blu-ray boxset was issued, containing the same 10 individual seasons in the original set, however the box is more cut down and is opened on one side, and also does not include the book that contained the episode guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n| DVD name\n | Eps\n | DVD release dates\n | Blu-ray release dates\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Region 1\n | Region 2\n | Region 4\n | Region A\n | Region B UK\n | Region B Australia\n |\n| The Complete First Season\n | 24\n | April 30, 2002[201] | May 29, 2000[*citation needed*] | October 4, 2006[202] | April 30, 2013\n |  |  |\n| The Complete Second Season\n | 24\n | September 3, 2002[203][204] | May 29, 2000[*citation needed*] | October 4, 2006[205] | April 30, 2013\n |  |  |\n| The Complete Third Season\n | 25\n | April 1, 2003[206] | May 29, 2000[*citation needed*] | October 4, 2006[207] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Fourth Season\n | 24\n | July 15, 2003[208] | May 29, 2000[*citation needed*] | October 4, 2006[209] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Fifth Season\n | 24\n | November 4, 2003[210] | May 29, 2000[*citation needed*] | October 4, 2006[211] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Sixth Season\n | 25\n | January 27, 2004[212] | July 17, 2000[213] | October 4, 2006[214] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Seventh Season\n | 24\n | April 6, 2004[215] | October 25, 2004[216] | October 4, 2006[217] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Eighth Season\n | 24\n | November 9, 2004[218] | October 25, 2004[219] | October 4, 2006[220] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Ninth Season\n | 24\n | March 8, 2005[221] | October 25, 2004[222] | October 4, 2006[223] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Tenth Season\n | 18\n | November 15, 2005[224] | October 25, 2004[225] | October 4, 2006[226] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Series\n | 236\n | November 15, 2005November 14, 2006(re-issue)April 16, 2013(re-issue 2013)September 17, 2019[227](re-issue 2019) | October 2, 2006November 12, 2007(re-issue)September 28, 2009(15th Anniversary Edition) |  | November 13, 2012\n | November 12, 2012\n | November 21, 2012(JB Hi-Fi exclusive)August 21, 2013\n |\n\n\n## Spin-off[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Joey (TV series)\n\n![](image)LeBlanc hoped that by having his own show, *Joey*, \"probably the least evolved character\" on *Friends* would become more developed.[228]\nAfter the series finale in 2004, LeBlanc signed on for the spin-off series, *Joey*, following Joey's move to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. Kauffman and Crane were not interested in the spin-off, although Bright agreed to executive produce the series with Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan.[229] NBC heavily promoted *Joey* and gave it *Friends*' Thursday 8:00 pm timeslot.[230][231]\n\n\nThe pilot was watched by 18.6 million American viewers,[232] but ratings continually decreased throughout the series's two seasons, averaging 10.2 million viewers in the first season and 7.1 million in the second.[72] The final broadcast episode on March 7, 2006, was watched by 7.09 million viewers;[233] NBC cancelled the series on May 15, 2006, after two seasons, leaving eight episodes unaired.[234] Bright blamed the collaboration between NBC executives, the studio and other producers for quickly ruining the series:[72]\n\n\n\n\n> On *Friends*, Joey was a womanizer, but we enjoyed his exploits. He was a solid friend, a guy you knew you could count on. Joey was deconstructed to be a guy who couldn't get a job, couldn't ask a girl out. He became a pathetic, mopey character. I felt he was moving in the wrong direction, but I was not heard. \n> \n> — Kevin S. Bright on the reason for *Joey*'s cancellation.[72]\n> \n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* *Friends 'Til the End*\n* The Friends Experience\n* Music of *Friends*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Fergus, George (December 12, 2018). \"Friends (1994) (a Titles & Air Dates Guide)\". epguides.

The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane.\n\n\nKauffman and Crane began developing *Friends* under the working title *Insomnia Cafe* between November and December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including title changes to *Six of One*[2] and *Friends Like Us*, the series was finally named *Friends*.[3] Filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions and Warner Bros. Television.\n\n\nThe show ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings; it ultimately reached the number-one spot in its eighth season. The series finale aired on May 6, 2004, and was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fifth-most-watched series finale in television history[4][5][6] and the most-watched television episode of the 2000s.[7][8] *Friends* received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular television shows of all time.[9] The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series award in 2002 for its eighth season.[10] The show ranked no. 21 on *TV Guide*'s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time,[11] and no. 5 on *Empire* magazine's The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.[12] In 1997, the episode \"The One with the Prom Video\" was ranked no. 100 on *TV Guide*'s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time.[13] In 2013, *Friends* ranked no. 24 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 Best Written TV Series of All Time,[14] and no. 28 on *TV Guide*'s 60 Best TV Series of All Time.[15] The sitcom's cast members returned for *Friends: The Reunion*, a reunion special which was released on HBO Max on May 27, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nSet in New York, N.Y, this series follows the eventful day-to-day lives of a group of 6 unique 20-something friends as they live, work, and love in the city.\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Friends and Joey characters\n\n* Main cast\n* ![Jennifer Aniston](image)\n\nJennifer Aniston as   \nRachel Green\n* ![Courteney Cox](image)\n\nCourteney Cox as   \nMonica Geller\n* ![Lisa Kudrow](image)\n\nLisa Kudrow as   \nPhoebe Buffay\n* ![Matt LeBlanc](image)\n\nMatt LeBlanc as   \nJoey Tribbiani\n* ![Matthew Perry](image)\n\nMatthew Perry as   \nChandler Bing\n* ![David Schwimmer](image)\n\nDavid Schwimmer as   \nRoss Geller\n\n\n* Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green:   \nA fashion enthusiast and Monica Geller's best friend from childhood. Rachel first moves in with Monica in season one after nearly marrying Barry Farber. Rachel and Ross Geller are later involved in an on-again, off-again relationship throughout the series. Rachel dates other men during the series, such as Italian neighbor, Paolo, in season one; Joshua Bergin, a client from Bloomingdale's, in season four; Tag Jones, her assistant, in season seven; and Joey Tribbiani, one of her close friends, in season ten. Rachel's first job is as a waitress at the coffee house Central Perk, but she later becomes an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's in season three, and a buyer at Ralph Lauren in season five. Rachel and Ross have a daughter named Emma in \"The One Where Rachel Has a Baby, Part Two\" at the end of season eight. In the final episode of the series, Ross and Rachel confess their love for each other, and Rachel gives up a dream fashion job at Louis Vuitton in Paris to be with him. It is heavily implied in the spin-off series, *Joey*, that Rachel married Ross after the series finale.\n* Courteney Cox as Monica Geller:   \nThe \"mother hen\" of the group and a chef,[16] known for her perfectionist, bossy, competitive, and obsessive-compulsive nature.[17][18] Monica was overweight as a child. She works as a chef in various restaurants throughout the show. Monica's first serious relationship is with a long-time family friend Richard Burke, who is twenty-one years her senior. The two maintain a strong relationship for some time until Richard expresses that he does not want to have children. Monica and Chandler, one of her best friends, later start a relationship after spending a night with each other in London in the season four finale, leading to their marriage in season seven and the adoption of twins at the end of the series.\n* Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay:   \nA masseuse and self-taught musician. As a child, Phoebe lived in upstate New York with her mother, until her mother committed suicide and Phoebe took to the streets. She writes and sings her own strange songs, accompanying herself on the guitar. She has an identical twin named Ursula, who shares few of Phoebe's traits. Phoebe has three serious relationships over the show's run: David, a scientist, in season one, with whom she breaks up when he moves to Minsk on a research grant; Gary, a police officer whose badge she finds, in season five; and an on-and-off relationship with Mike Hannigan in seasons nine and ten. In season nine, Phoebe and Mike break up due to his desire not to marry. David returns from Minsk, leading to the two getting back together, but she eventually rejects him for Mike when both of them propose to her. Phoebe and Mike marry in season ten.[19][20]\n* Matt LeBlanc as Joey Tribbiani:   \nA struggling actor and food lover who becomes famous for his role on soap opera *Days of Our Lives* as Dr. Drake Ramoray. Joey has many short-term girlfriends. Despite his womanizing, Joey is innocent, caring, and well-intentioned.[21] Joey often uses the catchphrase pick-up line \"How you doin'?\" in his attempts to win over most of the women he meets. Joey rooms with his best friend Chandler for years, and later with Rachel. He falls in love with Rachel in season eight, but Rachel politely tells Joey that she does not share his feelings. They eventually date briefly in season ten, but after realizing it will not work due to their friendship and Rachel's complicated relationship with Ross, they return to being friends. At the end of the series, he is the only remaining single member of the group, and becomes the main protagonist of the sequel series *Joey*.\n* Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing:   \nAn executive in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large, multinational corporation. Chandler hates this job, although it pays well. He attempts to quit during season one but is lured back with a new office and a pay raise. He eventually quits this job in season nine due to a transfer to Tulsa. He becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency later that season. Chandler has a peculiar family history being the son of an erotic novelist mother and a gay, cross-dressing Las Vegas star father. Chandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor and bad luck in relationships.[22] Chandler marries Monica, one of his best friends, in season seven, and they adopt twins at the end of the series. Before his relationship with Monica, Chandler dated Janice Hosenstein in season one and subsequently broke up with her many times.\n* David Schwimmer as Ross Geller:   \nMonica's \"geeky\" older brother, a palaeontologist working at the American Museum of Natural History, and later a tenured professor of palaeontology at New York University. Ross is involved in an on-again, off-again relationship with Rachel throughout the series. He has three failed marriages during the series: Carol Willick, a lesbian who is also the mother of his son, Ben Geller; Emily Waltham, who divorces him after he accidentally says Rachel's name instead of hers during their wedding vows; and Rachel, as the two drunkenly marry in Las Vegas. His divorces become a running joke within the series. Following a one-night stand, he and Rachel have a daughter, Emma, by the end of season eight. They finally confess that they are still in love with each other in the series finale. It is heavily implied in the spin-off series, *Joey*, that Ross married Rachel after the series finale.\n\n\nJames Michael Tyler appears as Gunther, a barista at Central Perk, in every season of the show, but is only ever credited as a guest star. Gunther has a mostly secret profound love for Rachel throughout the entire series. At one point he becomes the manager of the coffee house. It is revealed that Gunther speaks Dutch in addition to English, as well as being a former soap opera actor.\n\n\nIn their original contracts for the first season, cast members were paid $22,500 per episode.[23] The cast members received different salaries in the second season, beginning from the $20,000 range to $40,000 per episode.[23][24] Before their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals.[25] The actors were given the salary of the least paid cast member. The stars were each paid $75,000 per episode in season three, $85,000 in season four, $100,000 in season five, $125,000 in season six, $750,000 in seasons seven and eight, and $1 million in seasons nine and ten, making Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow the highest-paid TV actresses of all time.[26][27][28] The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations. At the time, that financial benefit of a piece of the show's lucrative back-end profits had only been given out to stars who had ownership rights in a show, like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby.[29]\n\n\nSeries creator David Crane wanted all six actors to be equally prominent,[30] and the series was lauded as being \"the first true 'ensemble' show.\"[31] The cast members made efforts to keep the ensemble format and not allow one member to dominate;[31] they entered themselves in the same acting categories for awards,[32] opted for collective salary negotiations,[31] and asked to appear together on magazine cover photos in the first season.[33] The cast members also became best friends off-screen,[34] so much so that recurring guest star Tom Selleck reported that he sometimes felt left out.[35]\n\n\nThe cast remained good friends after the series run, most notably Cox and Aniston, with Aniston being godmother to Cox and David Arquette's daughter, Coco.[36] In the official farewell commemorative book *Friends 'Til the End*, each separately acknowledged in interviews that the cast had become their family.[37][38]\n\n\n\n## Season synopses[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Friends episodes\n\n![](image)*Friends* in first season.

Rachel arrives at Central Perk, wearing her wedding dress, after leaving her fiancé, Barry, an orthodontist, at the altar. She moves into her high school friend Monica's apartment, and gets a waitress job at Central Perk.\n\n\nRoss, who has had a crush on Rachel since high school, often attempts to declare his feelings for her. However many obstacles stand in his way, including his insecurities, Rachel dating an Italian neighbor named Paolo, and the fact that he is expecting a baby with his lesbian ex-wife, Carol, who gives birth to Ben later in the season. Joey never has a steady girlfriend and constantly sleeps with a variety of women. Phoebe is rather odd and complex, mostly due to her mother's suicide when she was a child and having lived on the streets for a time. However, the gang loves her regardless.\n\n\nChandler breaks up with his girlfriend, Janice (Maggie Wheeler), only to find himself reconnecting with her throughout the series. Near the end of the season, while Ross is at a paleontology dig in China, Chandler accidentally lets slip that Ross loves Rachel, who then realizes that she also cares for him. The season ends with Rachel waiting at the airport for Ross, who is returning from China.\n\n\n\n### Season 2[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 2)\n\nRachel greets Ross at the airport only to discover that he has returned with Julie (Lauren Tom), someone he knew from graduate school. Rachel's attempts to tell Ross that she loves him initially mirror his failed attempts in the first season. After he breaks up with Julie for Rachel, friction between them develops when Rachel discovers Ross's list of the cons of dating her. They eventually begin a relationship after Rachel sees an old home video from her and Monica's prom night and realizes Ross was going to stand in for her prom date who nearly stood her up.\n\n\nMonica is promoted to head chef at the Iridium restaurant, then gets fired for accepting gifts from a supplier, which is against company policy. Needing money, she is forced to take an embarrassing job as a waitress at a 1950s-style diner. She begins dating Richard Burke (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced family friend who is 21 years her senior. They eventually break up when Monica realizes that Richard, already a father, does not want more children. Joey is cast in a fictional version of the soap opera, *Days of Our Lives* as neurosurgeon Dr. Drake Ramoray. He moves out of his and Chandler's apartment, forcing Chandler to get a new roommate, Eddie (Adam Goldberg).\n\n\nHowever, Eddie is annoying and somewhat deranged. When Joey claims in a soap opera magazine interview that he writes many of his own lines, offending the show's writer, his character is killed off. No longer able to afford his expensive new apartment, Joey moves back in with Chandler, kicking Eddie out in the process. In the season finale, Chandler talks to an anonymous woman in an online chat room. When they agree to meet in person, the woman turns out to be Janice.\n\n\n\n### Season 3[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 3)\n\nSeason 3 takes on a significantly more serialized format. Chandler and Janice date for several episodes until Joey catches Janice kissing her soon-to-be ex-husband. Not wanting to destroy her family, Chandler urges Janice to go back to her husband, then becomes depressed over the breakup for several episodes. Rachel quits her job at Central Perk and begins working at Bloomingdale's, an upscale department store chain. Ross soon becomes jealous of her colleague Mark and frustrated by Rachel's long work hours. She is tired of his constant jealousy and insecurity, and decides they need a relationship break.\n\n\nRoss, hurt and somewhat drunk, immediately sleeps with Chloe, \"the hot girl from the Xerox place,\" causing Rachel to break up with him completely. Although Phoebe initially believes she has no family except her twin sister Ursula (Lisa Kudrow), she learns she has a half-brother, Frank Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi) and discovers her birth mother, Phoebe Abbott (Teri Garr) over the course of the season. Joey falls in love with his acting partner Kate (Dina Meyer), but is jealous of her dating the director of their play. They begin a brief relationship that ends when she takes an acting job in Los Angeles.\n\n\nMonica dates millionaire Pete Becker (Jon Favreau), despite her initially not being attracted to him. However, she breaks up with Pete after he is seriously hurt trying to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion and refuses to quit. Phoebe sets Ross up on a date with her friend, Bonnie (Christine Taylor), inciting Rachel's jealousy. She tries sabotaging the relationship by coercing Bonnie to shave her head bald, and eventually admits to Ross that she still has feelings for him. The season closes with Ross having to choose between Rachel and Bonnie.\n\n\n\n### Season 4[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 4)\n\nIn the season 4 premiere, after Ross breaks up with Bonnie, he and Rachel briefly reconcile after Ross pretends to read a long letter that Rachel wrote for him. However, Ross continues to insist that the two were on a break when he slept with Chloe, so they break up again. Joey dates Kathy (Paget Brewster), a girl that Chandler has a crush on. Kathy and Chandler later kiss, which causes drama between Chandler and Joey. Joey only forgives Chandler and allows him to date Kathy after Chandler spends Thanksgiving in a box as punishment.\n\n\nChandler's relationship with Kathy ends after he discovers that she cheated on him due to an argument. Phoebe loses her job as a masseuse after making out with one of her clients and she accompanies Monica, who has become a caterer for hire. They soon start a catering business together but Monica, after negatively reviewing a restaurant, Allesandro's, is offered the position of head chef. Despite initially being pressured by the wrath of her co-workers, Monica eventually asserts her dominance in the kitchen. Phoebe becomes a surrogate for her brother and his wife, Alice (Debra Jo Rupp).\n\n\nMonica and Rachel are forced to switch apartments with Joey and Chandler after losing a bet during a quiz game, but manage to switch back by bribing them with Knicks season tickets and a one-minute kiss (off-screen) between each other. After her boss dies, Rachel is demoted to personal shopping and meets and later dates a customer named Joshua (Tate Donovan). Ross begins dating an English woman named Emily (Helen Baxendale), and they quickly get engaged. Rachel struggles to cope and hastily suggests to Joshua that they marry, after which he rejects her. In the season finale, the group, apart from a heavily pregnant Phoebe and Rachel, travel to Ross and Emily's wedding in London. Chandler and Monica sleep together, and Rachel, realizing that she is still in love with Ross, rushes to London to stop Ross and Emily's wedding, but changes her mind when she sees them happy together. While saying his vows, Ross accidentally says Rachel's name at the altar, shocking his bride and the guests.\n\n\n\n### Season 5[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 5)\n\nRoss and Emily marry, but an angry and humiliated Emily flees the reception. Rachel soon admits her love for Ross, but realizing how ridiculous this is, advises him to work on his marriage to Emily. She develops a crush on her neighbor Danny and they date briefly, until she realizes that he is too close with his sister. Monica and Chandler try to keep their new relationship a secret from their friends. Phoebe gives birth to triplets in the show's 100th episode. She gives birth to a boy, Frank Jr. Jr., and two girls, Leslie and Chandler, the latter of whom was supposed to be a boy, but was later revealed to be a girl.\n\n\nAfter weeks of trying to contact her, Emily agrees to reconcile with Ross and move to New York if he breaks off all communication with Rachel. Ross agrees, but later attends a dinner with all his friends, Rachel included. Emily phones Ross, discovers Rachel is there, realizes she does not trust him and ends their marriage. Ross takes out his anger at work, resulting in him being indefinitely suspended from the museum, and he moves in with Chandler and Joey until eventually getting a new apartment across the street from them.\n\n\nRachel gets a new job at Ralph Lauren. Phoebe has a brief relationship with a police officer, Gary (Michael Rapaport), after finding his badge and using it as her own.

They decide to get married on a trip to Las Vegas, but change their plans after witnessing Ross and Rachel drunkenly stumbling out of the wedding chapel.\n\n\n\n### Season 6[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 6)\n\nIn the season 6 premiere, Ross and Rachel's marriage turns out to be a drunken mistake that neither remembers until the other friends mention it. Ross promises Rachel he will get them an annulment, then secretly does nothing because he cannot face having three failed marriages. By the time Rachel discovers they are still married, an annulment is impossible due to their history; they are forced to get a divorce. After ignoring the numerous signs that they should get married, Monica and Chandler decide to live together, forcing Rachel to move in with Phoebe. Joey gets a new roommate, Janine (Elle Macpherson).\n\n\nThey develop feelings for each other and date briefly until Janine criticizes Monica and Chandler, ending the relationship. After Janine moves out, Joey struggles with paying his bills so he takes a job at Central Perk. He soon lands a role on a cable TV series called *Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.*, starring alongside a crime-fighting robot. Ross gets a teaching job at New York University. He dates Elizabeth (Alexandra Holden), a student, despite it being against university policy. Elizabeth's father, Paul (Bruce Willis), disapproves of Ross but falls for Rachel, and they start dating.\n\n\nBoth relationships soon end: Elizabeth is too immature for Ross, and previously reserved Paul opens up emotionally and is more than Rachel can handle. Phoebe and Rachel's apartment catches fire, and Rachel moves in with Joey, while Phoebe stays with Chandler and Monica, though they later switch. While at a museum that has a two-year wait for weddings, Monica puts her name on the reservation list as a joke. When Chandler intercepts the museum's phone call about a cancellation, he panics; however, Chandler has been planning to propose while pretending he may never want to marry.\n\n\nWhile dining at a fancy restaurant, Chandler's planned proposal is subverted by Monica's ex-boyfriend Richard Burke, who unexpectedly shows up. Richard later tells Monica he wants to marry her and have children. Monica becomes upset at Chandler, believing his ruse about not wanting to marry. Chandler believes Monica has left him until he comes home to find their apartment decorated with candles and her waiting to propose to him. When she becomes too emotional to continue, Chandler proposes and she accepts.\n\n\n\n### Season 7[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 7)\n\nThe seventh season mainly follows Monica and Chandler as they plan their wedding amid various problems. Joey's television series, *Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E* is canceled, but he is offered his old role on *Days of Our Lives*; the show is retconned with the revelation that Dr. Drake Ramoray has been in a four-year coma and is revived with a brain transplant from another character. Phoebe's repaired apartment now has one large bedroom instead of the original two, so Rachel permanently stays at Joey's. Rachel is promoted at Ralph Lauren and impulsively hires a young assistant, Tag Jones (Eddie Cahill), based on his looks, passing over a more qualified woman. Tag discovers her feelings about him at Thanksgiving dinner, and they begin dating, hiding it from co-workers. However, on her 30th birthday, Rachel ends their relationship, realizing Tag is too young and immature, particularly if she intends to follow her marriage schedule.\n\n\nHours before Monica and Chandler's wedding ceremony, Chandler panics and goes into hiding just as Phoebe and Rachel find a positive pregnancy test in Monica and Chandler's bathroom. They assume Monica is pregnant. Ross and Phoebe find Chandler and convince him to return for the ceremony, though he briefly bolts again after overhearing Phoebe and Rachel discussing the pregnancy test. He quickly returns, embracing the idea of fatherhood. After the ceremony, Monica denies she is pregnant; unbeknown to everyone, the positive pregnancy test is Rachel's.\n\n\n\n### Season 8[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 8)\n\nSeason 8 begins at Monica and Chandler's wedding reception. Phoebe and Monica discover Rachel's pregnancy and persuade her to take another test to confirm it. Phoebe initially claims the test is negative, badly disappointing Rachel, then reveals it is positive, saying Rachel now knows how she really feels about having a baby. Ross is eventually revealed to be the father, and the season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy. Rachel and Ross agree to be co-parents without resuming their romantic relationship; Ross begins dating Mona (Bonnie Somerville), who is Monica's co-worker from Allesandro's.\n\n\nJoey takes Rachel out to quell her fears about motherhood, and realizes he has romantic feelings for her. While suppressing his feelings, he encourages Rachel to stay at Ross's apartment so he can be involved in the pregnancy. The arrangement is too much for Mona, and she breaks up with Ross. Joey tells Ross about his feelings for Rachel. Ross initially is angry, then gives his blessing. Joey tells Rachel that he loves her, but she realizes she does not feel the same way, and they remain friends. When Rachel goes into labor, Ross's mother gives him a family heirloom ring and encourages him to propose to Rachel. Ross hesitates, and puts the ring in his jacket, which he later leaves in Rachel's room.\n\n\nAfter Monica jokes about having kids, she and Chandler decide to have a baby, starting while they are still at the hospital. After a prolonged labor, during which numerous other expectant mothers, including Janice, are taken to the delivery room, Rachel gives birth to baby Emma. She is left saddened and afraid after Janice later says that Ross may not always be there for her and the baby. When Joey comforts Rachel, the ring falls from Ross's jacket to the floor. Joey kneels to pick it up, and Rachel, believing he is proposing, impulsively says yes. Meanwhile, Ross intends to ask Rachel if she wants to resume their relationship.\n\n\n\n### Season 9[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends (season 9)\n\nSeason nine begins with Ross and Rachel cohabitating with their daughter Emma, after Joey and Rachel clear up the proposal misunderstanding. Monica and Chandler run into obstacles as they try for a baby: Chandler unknowingly agrees to a work transfer to Tulsa just as Monica is offered a head chef job at a new restaurant, Javu, resulting in Chandler commuting back and forth. After being apart from Monica during Christmas, Chandler quits to pursue a new career in advertising, starting as an unpaid intern at an ad agency, and eventually being hired as a junior copywriter. Monica and Chandler discover they are physically incompatible to conceive and after considering multiple options, decide to adopt.\n\n\nPhoebe begins dating Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd) for most of the season until Mike says that he never wants to marry again. Phoebe dates her ex-boyfriend from season 1, David (Hank Azaria) who plans on proposing to her, but Mike proposes first. Phoebe rejects both proposals but gets back together with Mike, only needing the reassurance that they have a future together. Rachel, believing that her co-worker Gavin (Dermot Mulroney) is trying to steal her job while she is on maternity leave, returns to Ralph Lauren early. She discovers at her birthday party that Gavin has feelings for her. They kiss but do not pursue a relationship due to her history with Ross.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Ross, having seen the kiss, retaliates by dating other women. After realizing that her and Ross's living situation is too weird, Rachel and Emma move in with Joey. Rachel develops a crush on him, only to be disheartened when he starts dating Charlie (Aisha Tyler), a new palaeontology professor to whom Ross is attracted. In the finale, the group travels to Barbados for Ross's keynote speech at a conference. Joey and Charlie break up upon realizing they have nothing in common.

Mid-season, Joey officiates Phoebe and Mike's wedding outside the Central Perk coffee house after a snow storm paralyzes the city, preventing them and guests getting to the wedding venue. Monica and Chandler are chosen by a pregnant woman named Erica (Anna Faris) to adopt her baby.\n\n\nFollowing this, Monica and Chandler prepare to move to a house in the suburbs to raise their family, saddening everyone, particularly Joey, who is coping with all the changes in his life. In the series finale, Erica gives birth to fraternal twins, much to Monica and Chandler's surprise. Rachel is fired from Ralph Lauren after her boss overhears her interviewing for a job at Gucci. She encounters her former Bloomingdale co-worker Mark, who offers her a new job at Louis Vuitton in Paris. Ross, believing Rachel wants to stay, tries bribing Mr. Zelner to rehire her until he realizes Rachel wants to go to Paris. When Rachel says a tearful personal goodbye to everyone except Ross at her going away party, a hurt and angry Ross confronts Rachel, and they end up sleeping together.\n\n\nRachel leaves, and Ross – realizing how much he loves Rachel – chases her to the airport. When he reaches her, Rachel says she has to go to Paris. Before the plane takes off, Rachel calls Ross's home phone and leaves a voice mail, apologizing for the way it ended. While speaking, she realizes that she loves him too, and gets off the plane at the last minute. The series ends with all the friends, plus Monica and Chandler's new babies, leaving the empty apartment together for a final cup of coffee at Central Perk. The show ends first with a shot of everyone's keys to Monica and Chandler's apartment left on the counter top, and then pans to a shot of the apartment's purple door.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Conception[edit]\n\n\n\n> It's about sex, love, relationships, careers, a time in your life when everything's possible. And it's about friendship because when you're single and in the city, your friends are your family.\n> \n> — The original treatment used by Crane, Kauffman and Bright to pitch the series to NBC.[49]\n> \n\n\nDavid Crane and Marta Kauffman began developing three new television pilots that would premiere in 1994 after their sitcom *Family Album* was cancelled by CBS in 1993.[50] Kauffman and Crane decided to pitch the series about \"six people in their 20s making their way in Manhattan\" to NBC since they thought it would fit best there.[51] (Film director and screenwriter Cameron Crowe has asserted that the concept originated with Warner Bros. Television wanting him to make his 1992 movie *Singles* into a television show.[52][53] Crowe alleges that when he refused permission, the idea was then taken over by Crane and Kaufman, who changed some details from the premise of the movie while developing the show.[52][53])\n\n\nCrane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series *Dream On*.[54] The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed they were looking at a time when the future was \"more of a question mark.\"[49] They found the concept to be interesting, as they believed \"everybody knows that feeling\",[49] and because it was also how they felt about their own lives at the time.[49] The team titled the series *Insomnia Cafe* and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to NBC in December 1993.[49][51]\n\n\nAt the same time, Warren Littlefield, the then-president of NBC Entertainment, was seeking a comedy involving young people living together and sharing expenses. Littlefield wanted the group to share memorable periods of their lives with friends, who had become \"new, surrogate family members.\"[19] However, Littlefield found difficulty in bringing the concept to life and found the scripts developed by NBC to be terrible. When Kauffman, Crane and Bright pitched *Insomnia Cafe*, Littlefield was impressed that they knew who their characters were.[19] NBC bought the idea as a put pilot, meaning they risked financial penalties if the pilot was not filmed.[55]\n\n\nKauffman and Crane took three days to write the pilot script for a show they titled *Friends Like Us.*[49][56] Littlefield wanted the series to \"represent Generation X and explore a new kind of tribal bonding\", but the rest disagreed. Crane argued that it was not a series for one generation, and wanted to produce a series that everyone would enjoy watching.[19] NBC liked the script and ordered the series. They changed the title to *Six of One*, mainly because they felt *Friends Like Us* was too similar to the ABC sitcom *These Friends of Mine*.[57]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Pilot (Friends)\n\n![](image)The producers wanted Courteney Cox (*pictured*) to portray Rachel; however, Cox wanted to play Monica and co-creator Marta Kauffman agreed after watching the audition.\nOnce it became apparent that the series was a favored project at NBC, Littlefield reported that he was getting calls from every agent in town, wanting their client to be a part of the series.[19] Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles.[58] The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75. Those who received a callback read in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright. At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and these actors were asked to read for Les Moonves, then president of Warner Bros. Television.[59]\n\n\nHaving worked with David Schwimmer in the past,[58] the series creators wrote the character of Ross with him in mind, and he was the first actor cast.[60] Cox wanted to play the role of Monica because she liked the \"strong\" character, but the producers had her in mind to play Rachel because of her \"cheery, upbeat energy\", which was not how they envisioned Monica; after Cox's audition, though, Kauffman agreed with Cox, and she got the role.[49][61] When Matt LeBlanc auditioned for Joey, he put a \"different spin\" on the character.[49] He played Joey more simple-minded than intended and gave the character heart. Although Crane and Kauffman did not want LeBlanc for the role at the time, they were told by the network to cast him.[49] Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow were cast based on their auditions.[58] Perry and Aniston, both still under contract to other shows that year, were cast days before shooting of the pilot began.[62]\n\n\nMore changes occurred to the series's storylines during the casting process. The writers found that they had to adjust the characters they had written to suit the actors, and the discovery process of the characters occurred throughout the first season. Kauffman acknowledged that Joey's character became \"this whole new being\", and that \"it wasn't until we did the first Thanksgiving episode that we realized how much fun Monica's neuroses are.\"[63]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nIn the weeks after NBC's pick up of *Friends*, Crane, Kauffman and Bright reviewed sent-in scripts that writers had originally prepared for other series, mainly unproduced *Seinfeld* episodes.[64] Kauffman and Crane hired a team of seven young writers because \"When you're 40, you can't do it anymore. The networks and studios are looking for young people coming in out of college.\"[65] The creators felt that using six equal characters, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for \"myriad storylines and give the show legs.\"[30] The majority of the storyline ideas came from the writers, although the actors added ideas.[58] Although the writers originally planned the big love story to be between Joey and Monica, the idea of a romantic interest between Ross and Rachel emerged during the period when Kauffman and Crane wrote the pilot script.[49]\n\n\nDuring the production of the pilot, NBC requested that the script be changed to feature one dominant storyline and several minor ones, but the writers refused, wanting to keep three storylines of equal weight.[57] NBC also wanted the writers to include an older character to balance out the young ones. Crane and Kauffman were forced to comply and wrote a draft of an early episode that featured \"Pat the Cop\". who would be used to provide advice to the other characters. Crane found the storyline to be terrible, and Kauffman joked, \"You know the kids [*sic*] book, *Pat the Bunny*? We had Pat the Cop.\" NBC eventually relented and dropped the idea.[49]\n\n\nEach summer, the producers would outline the storylines for the subsequent season.[66] Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign.[64] The hardest episodes to write were always \"the first one and the last one of each season.\"[67] Unlike other storylines, the idea for a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel.[66]\n\n\nThe storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none.[66] Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.[63]\n\n\nThe episode title format—\"The One ...\"[68]—was created when the producers realized that the episode titles would not be featured in the opening credits, and therefore would be unknown to most of the audience. Episode titles officially begin with \"The One ...\" except the title of the pilot episode and the series finale \"The Last One\". The season 5 episode \"The One Hundredth\" has the alternative title of \"The One With The Triplet\".\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Greenwich Village building, 90 Bedford Street, used as the friends' apartment block in establishing shots\nThe first season was shot on Stage 5 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.[69] NBC executives had worried that the coffee house setting was too hip and asked for the series to be set in a diner, but eventually consented to the coffee house concept.[49] The opening title sequence was filmed in a fountain at the Warner Bros. Ranch at 4:00 am, while it was particularly cold for a Burbank morning.[70] At the beginning of the second season, production moved to the larger Stage 24, which was renamed The \"Friends\" Stage after the series finale.[71]\n\n\nFilming for the series began during the summer of 1994 in front of a live audience, who were given a summary of the series to familiarize themselves with the six main characters.[49] A hired comedian entertained the studio audience between takes.[33] Each 22-minute episode took six hours to film—twice the length of most sitcom tapings—mainly due to the several retakes and rewrites of the script.[33]\n\n\nAlthough the producers always wanted to find the right stories to take advantage of being on location, *Friends* was never shot in New York. Bright felt that filming outside the studio made episodes less funny, even when shooting on the lot outside, and that the live audience was an integral part of the series.[58] When the series was criticized for incorrectly depicting New York, with the financially struggling group of friends being able to afford huge apartments, Bright noted that the set had to be big enough for the cameras, lighting, and \"for the audience to be able to see what's going on\".[58] The apartments also needed to provide a place for the actors to execute the actions in the scripts.[58]\n\n\nThe fourth-season finale was shot on location in London because the producers were aware of the series' popularity in the UK.[58] The scenes were shot in a studio with three audiences each made up of 500 people. These were the show's largest audiences throughout its run. The fifth-season finale, set in Las Vegas, was filmed at Warner Bros. Studios, although Bright met people who thought it was filmed on location.[72]\n\n\n\n## Series finale[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Last One (Friends)\n\n![](image)The cast became very emotional while filming the final episode. Jennifer Aniston explained, \"We're like very delicate china right now, and we're speeding toward a brick wall.\"[73]\nThe series's creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in January 2004, four months before its original airing. Crane, Kauffman and Bright watched the finales of other sitcoms to prepare the episode's outline, paying attention to what worked and what did not. They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, citing the finale of *The Mary Tyler Moore Show* as the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale. They did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\"[74] The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience and with a minimum number of crew members. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly:[74]\n\n\n\n\n> It's exactly what I had hoped. We all end up with a sense of a new beginning and the audience has a sense that it's a new chapter in the lives of all these characters. \n> \n> — David Schwimmer on the series finale.[74]\n> \n\n\nNBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype.[75] Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen.[76] The finale was the subject of two episodes of *Dateline NBC*, one of which ran for two hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before the airing of the episode. Following the finale, *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno* was filmed on the set of the *Friends*' Central Perk coffee house, which featured the cast as guests.[77][78] The advertising rates for the finale averaged $2 million for 30 seconds of commercial time, breaking the record held by the *Seinfeld* finale at $1.7 million.[76]\n\n\nIn the U.S., 52.5 million viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast since the *Seinfeld* finale in 1998.[77] The finale was the fifth most-watched series finale in television history, only behind the finales of *M\\*A\\*S\\*H*, *Cheers*, *The Fugitive*, and *Seinfeld*, which were respectively watched by 105, 80.4, 78.0 and 76.3 million viewers.[79] The retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36 million viewers, and the finale was the second most-watched television broadcast of the year in the United States, only behind the Super Bowl.[77] Following the finales of *Friends* and *Frasier*, media critics speculated about the fate of the sitcom genre. Opinions varied between a signalling of the end of the sitcom genre, a small decline in the large history of the genre,[76] and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows.[75]\n\n\n\n## Reunion special[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Friends: The Reunion\n\nOn November 12, 2019, *The Hollywood Reporter* announced that Warner Bros TV was developing a *Friends* reunion for HBO Max that would feature the whole cast and creators returning.[80] On February 21, 2020, HBO confirmed that the unscripted reunion special, tentatively named \"The One Where They Got Back Together\", was set to be released in May the same year, along with the 236 original episodes of the series.[81][82] On March 18, 2020, it was announced that the special, which was set to film on the *Friends* stage on March 23 and 24, had been postponed indefinitely, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[83] In November 2020, Matthew Perry tweeted that the reunion is set to start filming in March 2021.[84][85] On May 13, 2021, a teaser trailer was released officially announcing *Friends*: The Reunion also known as \"The One Where They Get Back Together\". The reunion special was released on HBO Max on May 27, 2021.[86]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nEarly reviews of the series were mixed; the first season holds a Metacritic score of 65 out of 100, based on 24 sampled reviews, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[87] Tom Feran of *The Plain Dealer* wrote that the series traded \"vaguely and less successfully on the hanging-out style of *Seinfeld*\",[88] while Ann Hodges of the *Houston Chronicle* called it \"the new *Seinfeld* wannabe, but it will never be as funny as *Seinfeld*.\"[89] In the *Los Angeles Daily News*, Ray Richmond named the series as \"one of the brighter comedies of the new season\",[90] and the *Los Angeles Times* called it \"flat-out the best comedy series of the new season.\"[91]\n\n\nThe *Chicago Sun-Times*' Ginny Holbert found Joey and Rachel's characters to be underdeveloped,[92] while Richmond commended the cast as a \"likeable youth ensemble\" with \"good chemistry.\"[90] Robert Bianco of *USA Today* was complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him \"terrific.\" He also praised the female leads, but was concerned that Perry's role as Chandler was \"undefined\" and that LeBlanc was \"relying too much on the same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it.\"[93] The authors of *Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends* thought that the cast was \"trying just a little too hard\"; in particular, Perry and Schwimmer.[94]\n\n\nAs the series progressed, reviews became more positive, and *Friends* became one of the most popular sitcoms of its time. It is now often ranked among the all-time best TV shows.[9][11][12] Critics commended the series for having consistently sharp writing and for the chemistry between the main actors.[95] Noel Holston of *Newsday*, who had dismissed the pilot as a \"so-so *Seinfeld* wannabe\" in 1994, repudiated his earlier review after rewatching the episode and felt like writing an apology to the writers.[63] Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com thought that the series \"hit its stride\" in the second season. Havrilesky found the character-specific jokes and situations \"could reliably make you laugh out loud a few times each episode\", and the quality of writing allowed the stories to be \"original and innovative.\"[96]\n\n\nBill Carter of *The New York Times* called the eighth season a \"truly stunning comeback.\" Carter found that by \"generating new hot storylines and high-decibel laughs\", the series made its way \"back into the hearts of its fans.\"[97] However, Liane Bonin of *Entertainment Weekly* felt that the direction of the ninth season was a \"disappointing buzzkill\", criticizing it for the non-stop celebrity guest spots and going into jump the shark territory. Although disappointed with the season, Bonin noted that \"the writing [was] still sharp.\"[98] Havrilesky thought that the tenth season was \"alarmingly awful, far worse than you would ever imagine a show that was once so good could be.\"[96] *Friends* was featured on *Time*'s list of \"The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time\", saying, \"the well-hidden secret of this show was that it called itself *Friends*, and was really about family.\"[99]\n\n\nReviews of the series finale were mostly positive. *USA Today*'s Robert Bianco described the finale as entertaining and satisfying and praised it for deftly mixing emotion and humor while highlighting each of the stars.[100] Sarah Rodman of the *Boston Herald* praised Aniston and Schwimmer for their acting, but felt that their characters' reunion was \"a bit too neat, even if it was what most of the show's legions of fans wanted.\"[101] Roger Catlin of the *Hartford Courant* felt that newcomers to the series would be \"surprised at how laughless the affair could be, and how nearly every strained gag depends on the sheer stupidity of its characters.\"[102] Ken Parish Perkins, writing for *Fort Worth Star-Telegram*, pointed out that the finale was \"more touching than comical, more satisfying in terms of closure than knee-slappingly funny.\"[103]\n\n\n\n\n> It may have been impossible for any one episode to live up to the hype and expectations built up around the Friends finale, but this hour probably came as close as fans could have reasonably hoped. Ultimately, the two-hour package did exactly what it was supposed to do. It wrapped up the story while reminding us why we liked the show and will miss it.\n> \n> — Robert Bianco of *USA Today* on the series finale.[100]\n> \n\n\nIn a 2021 program on ITV, *Mr. Bean* writer Richard Curtis accused the *Friends* writers of stealing the joke which involved Joey getting a turkey stuck on his head in \"The One with All the Thanksgivings\" from the 1992 episode \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean\". In that episode, Mr Bean got a turkey stuck on his head after losing his watch while stuffing the turkey and put his head in to try and retrieve it. Rowan Atkinson, however, argued that jokes are meant to be stolen, or to inspire.[104]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Friends\n\nTo maintain the series's ensemble format, the main cast members decided to enter themselves in the same acting categories for awards.[32] Beginning with the eighth season, the actors decided to submit themselves in the lead actor balloting, rather than in the supporting actor fields.[105] The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards,[106] winning six.\n\n\nAniston and Kudrow are the only main cast members to win an Emmy, while Cox is the only actor not to be nominated. The series won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2002, receiving nominations in 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, and 2003.[107] The series also won an American Comedy Award,[108] one GLAAD Media Award,[109] one Golden Globe Award,[110] three Logie Awards,[111][112] six People's Choice Awards,[113][114] one Satellite Award,[115] and one Screen Actors Guild Award.[116]\n\n\n\n### Ratings[edit]\n\n\nThe table below shows the ratings of *Friends* in the United States, where it consistently ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings.[117] \"Rank\" refers to how well *Friends* rated compared to other television series that aired during primetime hours of the corresponding television season. It is shown in relation to the total number of series airing on the then-six major English-language networks in a given season. \"Viewers\" refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes, broadcast during the television season in the series' regular timeslot. The \"season premiere\" is the date that the first episode of the season aired, and the \"season finale\" is the date that the final episode of the season aired. Following the September 11 attacks, ratings increased 17% over the previous season.[97]\n\n\n\n\n\nRatings table\n| Season\n | Timeslot\n | Season premiere\n | Season finale\n | TV season\n | Rank\n | Viewers(in millions)\n | Most-watched episode\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Title\n | Viewers(in millions)\n |\n| 1 | Thursday 8:30 pm  (1–16)  Thursday 9:30 pm  (17–24) | September 22, 1994\n | May 18, 1995\n | 1994–95 | 8 | 24.3[117] | \"The One Where Rachel Finds Out\"\n | 31.3[118] |\n| 2 | Thursday 8:00 pm\n | September 21, 1995\n | May 16, 1996\n | 1995–96 | 3 | 30[117] | \"The One After the Superbowl\"\n | 52.9[118] |\n| 3 | September 19, 1996\n | May 15, 1997\n | 1996–97 | 4 | 24.9[117] | \"The One Where Chandler Can't Remember Which Sister\"\n | 29.80[119] |\n| 4 | September 25, 1997\n | May 7, 1998\n | 1997–98 | 4 | 24.0[117] | \"The One with Ross's Wedding\"\n | 31.61[120] |\n| 5 | September 24, 1998\n | May 20, 1999\n | 1998–99 | 2 | 23.5[117] | \"The One After Ross Says Rachel\"\n | 31.12[121] |\n| 6 | September 23, 1999\n | May 18, 2000\n | 1999–2000 | 5 | 20.7[117] | \"The One with the Proposal\"\n | 30.73[122] |\n| 7 | October 12, 2000\n | May 17, 2001\n | 2000–01 | 5 | 20.2[117] | \"The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding\"\n | 30.05[123] |\n| 8 | September 27, 2001\n | May 16, 2002\n | 2001–02 | 1 | 24.5[117] | \"The One Where Rachel Has a Baby\"\n | 34.91[124] |\n| 9 | September 26, 2002\n | May 15, 2003\n | 2002–03 | 2 | 21.8[117] | \"The One Where No One Proposes\"\n | 34.01[125] |\n| 10 | September 25, 2003\n | May 6, 2004\n | 2003–04 | 4 | 22.8[117] | \"The Last One\"\n | 52.46[126] |\n\n\n### Syndication[edit]\n\n\nBecause of syndication revenue, *Friends* continues to generate approximately $1 billion each year for Warner Bros. That translates into about $20 million in annual residuals each for Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, who each get 2% of syndication income for *Friends*.[127]\n\n\nAll episodes became available on Netflix on January 1, 2015, introducing a new generation to the show. UK *Friends* reruns' ratings in 2015 increased by more than 10% annually. The 2016 reruns' US weekly audience, not including streaming, of 16 million would make it a hit on network television were the show still being produced.[128] In the US, the series has a syndication deal through multiple networks, including Nick at Nite, TBS, and Paramount Network. In July 2019, it was announced that from the beginning of 2020, *Friends* would not be available on Netflix in the US and instead would be shown on Warner Bros. Discovery's video-streaming service HBO Max,[129] which launched in May 2020.[130]\n\n\n\n## Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The set of Central Perk at Warner Bros. Studios\nAlthough the producers thought of *Friends* as \"only a TV show\", psychologists investigated the cultural impact of *Friends* during the series' run. Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed \"The Rachel\" and copied around the world.[19] Joey's catchphrase, \"How *you* doin'?\", became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends.[131] The series also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word \"*so*\" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier. Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change.[31] Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech.[132]\n\n\n*Friends* has also been credited in helping non-English speaking students to learn the language. A 2012 poll by Kaplan International English Colleges found that more than a quarter (26%) of its students cited the sitcom as the best show for helping them improve their English.[133] Notable individuals who have also said that the sitcom helped them learn English include Liverpool F.C. manager Jürgen Klopp,[134] BTS member RM[135] and Belgian professional golfer Thomas Pieters.[136]\n\n\n*Friends* was parodied in the twelfth season *Murder, She Wrote* episode \"Murder Among Friends\". In the episode, amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) investigates the murder of a writer for *Buds*, a fictional television series about the daily lives of a group of city friends. The episode was devised after CBS moved *Murder, She Wrote* from its regular Sunday night timeslot to a Thursday night timeslot directly opposite *Friends* on NBC; Angela Lansbury was quoted by Bruce Lansbury, her brother and *Murder, She Wrote*'s supervising producer, as having \"a bit of an attitude\" about the move to Thursday, but he saw the plot as \"a friendly setup, no mean-spiritedness.\"[137]\n\n\nJerry Ludwig, the writer of the episode, researched the \"flavor\" of *Buds* by watching episodes of *Friends*.[137] Producers of *Married... with Children* attempted to create a spinoff series called *Enemies*, which was intended to act as an antithesis to *Friends* in the same way *Married... with Children* had been to family sitcoms such as *The Cosby Show*. However, the Fox network declined to pick up the series.[138]\n\n\nThe Central Perk coffee house, one of the principal settings of the series, is part of the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood. People sometimes propose marriage on the couch, and many tourists cry when they sit on it.[128] The coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide. In 2006, Iranian businessman Mojtaba Asadian started a Central Perk franchise, registering the name in 32 countries. The decor of the coffee houses is inspired by *Friends*, featuring replica couches, counters, neon signage and bricks. The coffee houses contain paintings of the various characters from the series, and televisions playing *Friends* episodes. James Michael Tyler, who plays the Central Perk manager in the series, Gunther, attended the grand opening of the Dubai café, where he worked as a waiter.[139]\n\n\nCentral Perk was rebuilt as part of a museum exhibit at Warner Bros. Studios and was shown on *The Ellen DeGeneres Show* in October 2008. Jennifer Aniston visited the set for the first time since the series finale in 2004.[140] From September 24 to October 7, 2009, a Central Perk replica was based at Broadwick Street, Soho, London. The coffee house sold coffee to customers and featured a display of *Friends* memorabilia and props, such as the Geller Cup from the season three episode \"The One with the Football\".[141] In Beijing, business owner Du Xin opened a coffee shop named Central Perk in March 2010.[142]\n\n\n\n![](image)After filming on the finale concluded, Stage 24 at Warner Bros Studios, where *Friends* had been filmed since Season 2, was renamed \"The Friends Stage\".\nIn India, there are six *Friends*-themed cafes, located in Chandigarh (named Central Perk); Kolkata; and West Bengal (named F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Cafe), which features many icons from the original T.V. series, including Chandler and Joey's ugly dog statue, the orange sofa, the purple door of Monica and Rachel's apartment, and Phoebe's pink bicycle. The other three cafes are located in Delhi, Gurgaon; Bhubaneswar, Odisha; and Pune, Maharashtra.[143][144]\n\n\nThere are two *Friends* themed cafes in Pakistan—one in Lahore, Punjab, known as \"Friends Cafe\" and the other in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa called \"Central Perk\". Both cafes have an iconic couch, a guitar and foosball table, quotes from the show on the walls and episode reruns on a projector. They're planning to have their own Gunther at the bar.[145]\n\n\nIn 2016, a Central Perk replica was opened in Outram, Singapore. It is the only Central Perk that has been given the intellectual property rights by Warner Bros. outside of the United States. The café includes feature walls, replicating the walls of the main characters' apartments and memorabilia and props used on the show.[146][147] In August 2019, it was announced that a Central Perk Lego set would be launched to mark the show's 25 anniversary.[148]\n\n\n*Friends* has also developed an alternative family lifestyle by representing young people who live unconventional domestic lives. It presents the idea that \"all you need are good friends\" and can construct families through choice. The audience is able to identify with the program through the troubles seen on weekly episodes. It portrays a new way of living life and developing relationships which are not normally seen in conventional society.[149] According to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, *Friends* is \"one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture.\" The images of youth and the roles they portray are better defined and represent a lifestyle that centres around creating and sustaining relationships between friends running their own lives and seeking help from each other.[150]\n\n\n\n![](image)The *Friends* Experience exhibit at Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto in 2022[151]\n*Vox* stated that *Friends* had an impact on the creation of other conflictless \"hangout sitcoms\", with groups of adult friends who are funny and have similar character traits. One example of this is *How I Met Your Mother*, which *The Guardian*'s TV and radio blog notes also shares its setting with *Friends*, Manhattan. Other examples include *The Big Bang Theory*, *New Girl*, and *Happy Endings*.[152][153][154][155]\n\n\nReaders of *TV Guide* voted the cast of *Friends* their Best Comedy cast of all time, ranking at 29% of the votes, beating *Seinfeld*, which registered 18%.[156] A poll undertaken by *60 Minutes* and *Vanity Fair* named *Friends* the third-greatest sitcom of all time.[157] In 2014, the series was ranked by *Mundo Estranho* the Best TV Series of All Time.[158] A 2015 survey by *The Hollywood Reporter* of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named *Friends* as their No. 1 favorite show.[159]\n\n\n\n## Distribution[edit]\n\n\n### Broadcast[edit]\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nAfter the produced pilot lived up to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name *Friends* on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30 p.m. time slot. The pilot aired between *Mad About You* and *Seinfeld*,[19] and was watched by almost 22 million American viewers.[3] The series was a huge success throughout its run and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV.[160] When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing and that at least two of the cast members would not sign on for another season.[97] When it was confirmed that *Friends* would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7 million per episode—that it took to bring the series back for another season.[97]\n\n\nAfter year-long expectations that the ninth season would be the series's last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team did not want to extend negotiations into the next year and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale.[161] NBC agreed to pay $10 million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series.[95] Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series.[161] The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.[98]\n\n\nIn fall 2001, Warner Bros. Domestic Cable made a deal with sister network TBS (both were owned by Time Warner) to air the series in rerun syndication. Warner Bros. Domestic Cable announced that it had sold additional cable rights to *Friends* to Nick at Nite which began airing in the fall of 2011 (unlike the TBS and broadcast syndication airings, Nick at Nite broadcasts of the series, which began airing as part of a seven-night launch marathon on September 5, 2011, replace the end credit tag scenes with marginalized credits featuring promotions for the series and other Nick at Nite programs). Warner Bros. was expected to make $200 million in license fees and advertising from the deal. Nick at Nite paid $500,000 per episode to air the episodes after 6 pm. ET for six years through fall 2017. In syndication until 2005, *Friends* had earned $4 million per episode in cash license fees for a total of $944 million.[162]\n\n\nComedy Central began airing reruns of *Friends* in October 2019.\n\n\n\n#### International[edit]\n\n\nHaving already made huge success in the United States, *Friends* producers decided to air the show in Europe. It premiered in the United Kingdom on April 28, 1995.[163] Season 1 was broadcast until September 1995 on Channel 4 at 9:30 PM on Friday nights, and immediately was a success. The popularity of the show allowed the theme song by the Rembrandts to hit number 3 on the UK Singles Charts in September 1995.[164]\n\n\nThe popularity of the show in Britain led to an episode being produced in London at the end of the fourth season, starring British actress Helen Baxendale, who became a leading cast member in seasons four and five during her character's relationship with Ross. The show has since aired on different channels in the UK in their original, unedited international versions prior to their being re-edited for US broadcast and syndication. These versions, with additional footage not seen domestically, have aired on such stations as Channel 4, Sky1, E4, and Comedy Central UK.[165][166][167][168][169]\n\n\nIn September 2011, *Friends* officially ended on E4 after the channel re-ran the series since 2004. Comedy Central took over the rights to air the program from October 2011. Since 2018 Channel 5 started airing the program. In the Republic of Ireland, each season of the show made its European debut on RTÉ2. After 2004 RTÉ2 began to repeat the series from the start before moving over to TV3 and its digital channel 3e in 2010.[170][171] As of February 2015[update], repeats of the show have returned to RTÉ2 while also broadcasting on Comedy Central Ireland.[172][173]\n\n\nSeason 10's finale in the UK, broadcast on May 28, 2004, was on Channel 4. It was broadcast from 9 pm to 10 pm and attracted *Friends'* largest UK audiences. It attracted almost 10 million viewers, and is currently standing at Number 10 in Channel 4's most-watched shows. *Big Brother* was moved to 10 pm, which *Friends* had beaten. *Friends* got 9.6 million viewers at 9 pm, while *Big Brother 5*'s launch attracted 7.2 million viewers at 10 pm, which is the most-watched premiere on UK TV ever. However, on January 3, 2007, *Celebrity Big Brother 5*'s launch was watched by 7.3 million viewers, and its eviction on January 19, 2007, was watched by 8.7 million viewers.\n\n\n*Friends* has previously aired in Australia on the Seven Network (season 1), Nine Network (season 2–10), Network Ten (2007–09, repeats), Arena, 111 Hits, 9Gem (2012–2018, repeats), and TVHits. It currently airs on 10 Peach and on pay TV channel Fox Comedy, both of which broadcast the high-definition version of the series.[174][175] The show is broadcast on TV2 in New Zealand.[176]\n\n\nIn Canada, the series was broadcast on Global. In later years, it was syndicated on several of its cable sibling networks, including Slice, DTour, and TVTropolis, its previous incarnation.[177][178] The series is now syndicated to Bell Media owned CTV Comedy Channel.\n\n\nIn Latin America, the first seven seasons aired on Sony, and the remaining seasons on Warner.[179] In Brazil, free-to-air networks RedeTV! and SBT also aired a few seasons.\n\n\nIn India, the show is broadcast by Comedy Central at various times. It is the most-watched English language show in the country.[180]\n\n\nIn the Philippines, the show was originally aired on ABC-5[181][182]\nfrom 1996 to 2005 and ETC from 2005 to 2014.\n\n\nIn Greece, the show was broadcast on Star Channel.[183] In Cyprus, *Friends* aired on CyBC 2 while reruns air on TVOne.[184]\n\n\nIn 2022, Bilibili, iQIYI, Tencent Video, and Youku began distributing edited *Friends* episodes in China. These edited versions of episodes removed most LGBT content, not edited in original Chinese airings. Chinese fans of the show reacted negatively online.[185]\n\n\n\n### Remaster[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in March 2012, high definition versions of all 236 *Friends* episodes were made available to local broadcast stations, starting with the pilot episode. For the remastered episodes, Warner Bros. restored previously cropped images on the left and right sides of the screen, using the original 35 mm film source, to use the entire 16:9 widescreen frame. Because the show was not originally filmed for widescreen, but rather filmed in 4-perf format and protected for 4:3, some cropping problems arise in some shots where information from the top and bottom of the frame is removed, and some expanded shots reveal unintentional artifacts, including set edges, boom mics and body doubles replacing some of the main cast.[186]\n\n\nIn early versions of the HD remasters, there were also a few shots, including chroma effects shots, which were sourced from standard-definition videotape sources, as not all of the footage had been located in time for the remaster. The original film sources for these shots were later rescanned for later broadcast and release.[186] These masters had been airing in New Zealand on TV2 since January 2011, and the earlier HD prints continue to air on Comedy Central in the United Kingdom as of 2020.[187] Netflix added all ten seasons of *Friends* in high definition to its streaming service in the United States in January 2015 before the platform discontinued the series in late 2019.\n\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n### Streaming[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Warner Bros. chairman and chief executive officer, Kevin Tsujihara, announced that the company had licensed the North American streaming rights of all ten seasons of *Friends* to Netflix,[188][189] in a deal said to be worth around $500,000 an episode,[190] or about $120 million in total. The show became available on Netflix from January 1, 2015.[191] The Netflix airings are the versions aired on NBC rather than the longer international versions, as discussed below. The series left Netflix in the US on January 1, 2020, as it began streaming on HBO Max on May 27, 2020.[192] The series left Netflix in Canada for Crave on December 31, 2020.[193]\n\n\n\n### Blu-ray and DVD[edit]\n\n\nAll ten seasons have been released on DVD individually and as a box set. Each Region 1 season release contains special features and are presented in their aforementioned original international broadcast versions, although Region 2 releases are as originally aired domestically. For the first season, each episode is updated with color correction and sound enhancement.[58] A wide range of *Friends* merchandise has been produced by various companies. In September 1995, WEA Records released the first album of music from *Friends*, the *Friends Original TV Soundtrack*, containing music featured in previous and future episodes. The soundtrack debuted on the *Billboard* 200 at number 46,[194] and sold 500,000 copies in November 1995.[195]\n\n\nIn 1999, a second soundtrack album entitled *Friends Again* was released.[196] Other merchandise includes a *Friends* version of the DVD game \"Scene It?\", and a quiz video game for PlayStation 2 and PC entitled *Friends: The One with All the Trivia*.[197][198] On September 28, 2009, a box set was released in the UK celebrating the show's 15th anniversary. The box set contained extended episodes, an episode guide, and original special features.[199]\n\n\nWarner Home Video released a complete series collection on Blu-ray on November 13, 2012.[200] The collection does not feature the extra deleted scenes and jokes that were included on prior DVD releases, and are therefore presented in their NBC broadcast versions.\n\n\nIn Australia, the original DVD releases were fold out box sets which contained three discs, and released as follows: Season 1 and Season 2 on March 13, 2002, Season 3 and Season 4 on July 9, 2002, Season 5, 6 and 7 on July 29, 2002, Season 8 on March 18, 2003, Season 9 on February 11, 2004, and Season 10 on November 24, 2004. Repackaged sets, slimmed into regular DVD cases also containing three discs were released from 2003 to 2004. Collector's Edition sets were released from September 9, 2003, through to February 1, 2006, these sets contains 4 discs, in fat DVD cases, with extra bonus material.\n\n\nOn October 4, 2006, the individual seasons were repackaged into regular DVD case sets and marked as \"Including Brand New Bonus Disc\". Once again each individual season were repackaged with new artwork on March 31, 2010. The first complete series boxset on DVD was released around 2004 or 2005, this was titled 'The One With All Ten Seasons\" and the packaging was a black box with a lift up lid and contains exclusive packaging for all ten seasons.\n\n\nThe second complete series boxset was released August 21, 2013 and was a red box which contained the 2010 individual season sets inside. On October 1, 2014, was the 20th Anniversary boxset, this was a white box and contained the same 2010 individual releases inside. On October 7, 2015, another boxset was released 'The One With All Ten Seasons\", the same name used on the original boxset, however this time slimmed down and contains the 2010 individual releases inside. The outer box is open on insert side for the cases to slide in and out, more of a budget release. In 2016, a repackaged 'The Complete Series' Blu-ray boxset was issued, containing the same 10 individual seasons in the original set, however the box is more cut down and is opened on one side, and also does not include the book that contained the episode guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n| DVD name\n | Eps\n | DVD release dates\n | Blu-ray release dates\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Region 1\n | Region 2\n | Region 4\n | Region A\n | Region B UK\n | Region B Australia\n |\n| The Complete First Season\n | 24\n | April 30, 2002[201] | May 29, 2000[*citation needed*] | October 4, 2006[202] | April 30, 2013\n |  |  |\n| The Complete Second Season\n | 24\n | September 3, 2002[203][204] | May 29, 2000[*citation needed*] | October 4, 2006[205] | April 30, 2013\n |  |  |\n| The Complete Third Season\n | 25\n | April 1, 2003[206] | May 29, 2000[*citation needed*] | October 4, 2006[207] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Fourth Season\n | 24\n | July 15, 2003[208] | May 29, 2000[*citation needed*] | October 4, 2006[209] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Fifth Season\n | 24\n | November 4, 2003[210] | May 29, 2000[*citation needed*] | October 4, 2006[211] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Sixth Season\n | 25\n | January 27, 2004[212] | July 17, 2000[213] | October 4, 2006[214] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Seventh Season\n | 24\n | April 6, 2004[215] | October 25, 2004[216] | October 4, 2006[217] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Eighth Season\n | 24\n | November 9, 2004[218] | October 25, 2004[219] | October 4, 2006[220] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Ninth Season\n | 24\n | March 8, 2005[221] | October 25, 2004[222] | October 4, 2006[223] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Tenth Season\n | 18\n | November 15, 2005[224] | October 25, 2004[225] | October 4, 2006[226] |  |  |  |\n| The Complete Series\n | 236\n | November 15, 2005November 14, 2006(re-issue)April 16, 2013(re-issue 2013)September 17, 2019[227](re-issue 2019) | October 2, 2006November 12, 2007(re-issue)September 28, 2009(15th Anniversary Edition) |  | November 13, 2012\n | November 12, 2012\n | November 21, 2012(JB Hi-Fi exclusive)August 21, 2013\n |\n\n\n## Spin-off[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Joey (TV series)\n\n![](image)LeBlanc hoped that by having his own show, *Joey*, \"probably the least evolved character\" on *Friends* would become more developed.[228]\nAfter the series finale in 2004, LeBlanc signed on for the spin-off series, *Joey*, following Joey's move to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. Kauffman and Crane were not interested in the spin-off, although Bright agreed to executive produce the series with Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan.[229] NBC heavily promoted *Joey* and gave it *Friends*' Thursday 8:00 pm timeslot.[230][231]\n\n\nThe pilot was watched by 18.6 million American viewers,[232] but ratings continually decreased throughout the series's two seasons, averaging 10.2 million viewers in the first season and 7.1 million in the second.[72] The final broadcast episode on March 7, 2006, was watched by 7.09 million viewers;[233] NBC cancelled the series on May 15, 2006, after two seasons, leaving eight episodes unaired.[234] Bright blamed the collaboration between NBC executives, the studio and other producers for quickly ruining the series:[72]\n\n\n\n\n> On *Friends*, Joey was a womanizer, but we enjoyed his exploits. He was a solid friend, a guy you knew you could count on. Joey was deconstructed to be a guy who couldn't get a job, couldn't ask a girl out. He became a pathetic, mopey character. I felt he was moving in the wrong direction, but I was not heard. \n> \n> — Kevin S. Bright on the reason for *Joey*'s cancellation.[72]\n> \n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* *Friends 'Til the End*\n* The Friends Experience\n* Music of *Friends*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Fergus, George (December 12, 2018). \"Friends (1994) (a Titles & Air Dates Guide)\". epguides.

Núñez Jr.), and Howard (Ben Falcone). \n\n\nMany well-known actors guest-starred on both series throughout their combined twelve-year run.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Ensemble cast[edit]\n\n\nThe main cast members of *Friends* were familiar to US television viewers before their roles on the series, but were not considered to be stars.[3][4] Series creator David Crane wanted all six characters to be equally prominent,[5] and the series was lauded as being \"the first true 'ensemble' show\".[6] The cast members made efforts to keep the ensemble format and not allow one member to dominate;[6] they entered themselves in the same acting categories for awards,[7] opted for collective instead of individual salary negotiations,[6] and asked to appear together on magazine cover photos in the first season.[8] The cast members became best friends off screen,[9] and one guest star, Tom Selleck, reported sometimes feeling left out.[10] The cast remained good friends after the series' run, notably Cox and Aniston, with Aniston being godmother to Cox and David Arquette's daughter, Coco.[11] In the official farewell commemorative book *Friends 'Til the End*, each separately acknowledged in their respective interview that the cast had become their family.[12]\n\n\n\n### Salaries[edit]\n\n\nIn their original contracts for the first season, the main cast were paid $22,500 per episode.[13] The cast members received different salaries in the second season, ranging from $25,000 to $40,000 per episode, with Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer being the highest paid.[13][14] Prior to their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals.[15] The main cast were paid $75,000 per episode for the third season, $85,000 for the fourth, $100,000 for the fifth, and $125,000 for the sixth.[16] They received $750,000 per episode for the seventh and eighth seasons, and $1 million per episode for the ninth and tenth seasons.[17] The cast also receive syndication royalties beginning with the fifth season.[14]\n\n\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Character\n | Portrayed by\n | *Friends* | *Joey* |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 1 | 2 |\n| Joseph Francis \"Joey\" Tribbiani Jr. | Matt LeBlanc | Main |\n| Rachel Karen Green | Jennifer Aniston | Main |  |\n| Monica Geller | Courteney Cox | Main |  |\n| Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan | Lisa Kudrow | Main |  |\n| Ursula Buffay | Guest |  | Guest[a] |  |\n| Chandler Muriel Bing | Matthew Perry | Main |  |\n| Ross Geller, Ph.D | David Schwimmer | Main |  |\n| Russ, Ph.D |  | Guest[b] |  |\n| Mike Hannigan | Paul Rudd |  | Also starring |  |\n| Gina Tribbiani | K.J.

All six actors appear in every episode.\n\n\n\n#### Rachel Green[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rachel Green\n\n**Rachel Karen Green** (Jennifer Aniston) is the spoiled but warm-hearted and likable daughter of Dr. Leonard Green (Ron Leibman), a rich, Long Island vascular surgeon, and Sandra Green (Marlo Thomas). She has two sisters, Jill (Reese Witherspoon) and Amy (Christina Applegate). Rachel is introduced into the series in the first episode after she leaves her fiancé, Barry Farber, at the altar, and attempts to live independently without financial support from her parents.[e 3] She flees from her almost-wedding to New York City to find Monica Geller, her friend from high school. Rachel moves into Monica's apartment and meets Phoebe Buffay and Joey Tribbiani. Rachel already knows Ross Geller, Monica's brother, as all three attended Lincoln High School. In the first episode, she is also reacquainted with Chandler Bing, Ross's college buddy; however, later episodes retcon this, and she is shown to have met Chandler on Thanksgiving, whilst Ross was at college. Rachel's first job is as a waitress at Central Perk coffee house. She later begins to work in fashion, becoming an assistant buyer, and later a personal shopper, at Bloomingdale's. She eventually becomes a buyer at Polo Ralph Lauren.\n\n\nA great deal of Rachel's life throughout the series revolves around her relationship with Ross Geller. At the end of season seven, during Monica's and Chandler's wedding, it is revealed that Rachel is pregnant from a one-night stand with Ross. Initially, Rachel is determined to raise the baby on her own, but later she realizes she needs Ross's help. She decides to move in with Ross, even though the two are not involved in an intimate relationship. Their daughter is born during the eighth-season finale. Her aunt Monica, 'gives' an indecisive Rachel the name Emma, which she had chosen for her own daughter, at age 14.\n\n\nDuring the tenth season, Rachel is offered a job with Louis Vuitton in Paris. She accepts and prepares to move herself and Emma to France. However, in the series finale, she declines the job offer and famously \"gets off the plane\". Rachel and Ross get back together in the final episode of the series.[e 4]\n\n\n\n#### Monica Geller[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Monica Geller\n\n**Monica E. Geller** (Courteney Cox) is the younger sister of Ross and best friend of Rachel, the latter of whom she allows to live with her after Rachel forsakes her own wedding. She works primarily as a chef at a variety of restaurants. She is described as the mother hen of the group,[18] and is known for her obsessive-compulsive and competitive nature.[19][20] Monica is often jokingly teased by the others, especially Ross, for having been overweight as a teen.\n\n\nIn the second season, Monica falls for her father Jack's (Elliott Gould) friend, Richard Burke (Tom Selleck). Despite the twenty-one year age difference, Monica and Richard are happy, and her parents accept their relationship. However, as a result of Monica yearning for a family but Richard having already had one, they break up at the end of the second season. Monica then pursues a chain of various men until she unexpectedly begins a relationship with her longtime friend, Chandler Bing, at the end of the fourth season, during her brother Ross' wedding to Emily Waltham in London. Monica and Chandler try to hide their relationship from the rest of the group for much of the fifth season, but eventually everyone finds out. After celebrating their first anniversary in Las Vegas, they move in together and get engaged by the sixth-season finale. After their marriage, Monica and Chandler try to conceive children, only to discover that they are unable to do so. In the final season of the series, they adopt new-born twins, whom they name Erica and Jack.\n\n\n\n#### Phoebe Buffay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Phoebe Buffay\n\n**Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan** (Lisa Kudrow) is an odd, ditzy albeit sweet-natured masseuse who grew up homeless, sometimes telling her friends outlandish tales of life on the street. She is an aspiring musician who plays the guitar and sings songs with somewhat unusual lyrics at the coffee shop. She has an identical twin sister, Ursula Pamela Buffay (also played by Kudrow), who is just as odd as Phoebe and appeared as a recurring character on *Mad About You*. After a series of dates and relationships with a number of men, Phoebe meets Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd) in season nine, whom she eventually marries in season ten. She also became a surrogate mother for her half-brother Frank Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi), giving birth to his triplets in the fifth season.\n\n\n\n#### Joey Tribbiani[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Joey Tribbiani\n\n**Joseph Francis \"Joey\" Tribbiani Jr.** (Matt LeBlanc) is a good-natured but not-so-bright struggling actor and food lover, who becomes mildly famous for his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on a fictionalized version of *Days of Our Lives*. Joey is a womanizer, with many girlfriends throughout the series, often using his catchphrase pick-up line \"How *you* doin'?\" He develops a crush on Rachel in season eight.\n\n\nPrior to his role on *Friends*, LeBlanc appeared as a regular on the short-lived *TV 101*, a minor character in the sitcom *Married... with Children*, and as a main character in its spin-offs, *Top of the Heap* and *Vinnie & Bobby*.[21] After *Friends* ended, LeBlanc portrayed Joey in a short-lived spin-off, *Joey*.\n\n\n\n#### Chandler Bing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chandler Bing\n\n**Chandler Muriel Bing** (Matthew Perry) is an executive in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large multi-national corporation. He later quits his job and becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency.\n\n\nChandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor.[22] He often teases his best friend Joey for the latter's stupidity. Chandler is often depicted as being somewhat of a hapless individual, suffering a lot of bad luck while struggling through life and occasionally struggling with an on-and-off smoking addiction. However, he eventually falls in deep mutual love with Monica and proposes to her at the close of season six, with the two of them marrying at the close of season seven. At the end of series, he and Monica adopt twins, whom they name Jack and Erica.[17]\n\n\nLike Aniston and LeBlanc, Perry had already appeared in several unsuccessful sitcom pilots before being cast. He had also starred in the TV series *Second Chance* and *Sydney*.\n\n\n\n#### Ross Geller[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ross Geller\n\n**Ross Geller** (David Schwimmer) is a paleontologist at a museum of prehistory, and later a professor of paleontology at New York University. Considered by some to be the most intelligent of the six main characters, but at the same time a clumsyquirky man, Ross is known for being a smart, know-it-all who prides himself on his rationality, despite his clear hopeless romanticism. He is shown to be the most caring of all six members in various instances on the show, but also shown to be the most neurotic and his insecurities often get him into trouble.\n\n\nRoss is Monica's older brother, Chandler's college roommate, and Rachel's on-again, off-again boyfriend. His first marriage has already failed by the time the show begins, with his second lasting mere weeks. The second divorce seemed to greatly depress him and make him quick-tempered near the start of season five, such as when he screams at his colleague for taking his sandwich and throwing it away. After he gets Ugly Naked Guy's apartment, he is offered to return to work, but he loses his temper again when he sees Chandler and Monica having sex through his window, becoming the last one to find out about their relationship. He also drunkenly married Rachel in Las Vegas, after which they unsuccessfully tried to annul it and had to settle for a divorce, which became Ross' third one. Ross's relationship with Rachel is a major storyline throughout the series. He is also the father of his ex-wife Carol's son, Ben, and Rachel's daughter, Emma. In the series finale, Ross and Rachel finally reconcile, deciding to be together once and for all.\n\n\nThe character of Ross was developed with David Schwimmer in the minds of writers and Schwimmer was also the first actor to be cast on the show.\n\n\nBefore being cast in *Friends*, Schwimmer played minor characters in *The Wonder Years* and *NYPD Blue*;[23] his first regular series role was in the sitcom *Monty*. Schwimmer is the only cast member native to New York City.\n\n\nRoss Geller was also voted as the best character on *Friends* in a poll conducted by Comedy Central UK.[24]\n\n\n\n### *Joey*[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Temperamental, promiscuous and not particularly bright but very street-wise, Gina is a caring but over-protective and domineering mother. For years she convinced her genius son Michael that he was born when she was 22 instead of 16 years old, and always says he is the one thing she has done well. She and Joey are friends in addition to being siblings, both having the gift of being extremely appealing to the opposite sex, with numerous lovers. Initially working as a hairdresser, by season two she works as a secretary for Joey's agent Bobbie, having impressed Bobbie with her brash manner. In season two she starts dating Michael's father Jimmy once again. In the season 2 episode \"Joey and the Holding Hands\", it is implied that Gina may be bisexual.\n\n\n\n#### Alex Garrett[edit]\n\n\n**Alexis \"Alex\" Garrett** (Andrea Anders) is Joey's next-door neighbor, landlady and friend in *Joey*. She is an educated, but slightly ditzy, blonde lawyer who graduated from Northwestern University and Pepperdine University School of Law. Initially intimidated, but also intrigued by Joey's tough street-wise older sister Gina, the two women eventually become friends and she becomes more bold in the way she dresses and acts, thanks to Gina's influence. She is puzzled but impressed by Joey's intuitive gift at being able to know when she is wearing thong panties and spends most of her time hanging out at Joey and Michael's apartment. She and Joey bond and become close friends. Her husband is a professional orchestra musician and is away from home most of the time and she confides her problems with her marriage in Joey. At the end of season one, she and Joey become romantically involved during her separation from her husband.\n\n\nIn season two, Alex becomes romantically interested in Joey and has a crush on him for a long period. Gina tries to help her to get over Joey, but once Alex starts dating Joey's friend Dean, Joey soon realizes that he is also in love with Alex. Alex and Joey start dating in season 2 and shortly before the final episode they become engaged.\n\n\nMatt LeBlanc and Andrea Anders dated in real life for several years after the cancellation of *Joey*.\n\n\n\n#### Michael Tribbiani[edit]\n\n\n**Michael Tribbiani** (Paulo Costanzo) is Joey's nephew who idolizes his Uncle Joey's ability to date many women, and who himself is sheltered and nervous around girls. He is self-conscious that he has been so sheltered and that his mother Gina breast fed him until he was seven. Early in the second season of *Joey* it is revealed that Michael has Asperger syndrome. He is a huge *Star Trek: The Next Generation* and *Star Wars* fan. He is extremely intelligent, an aerospace engineer, attends Caltech and specialises in applied thermodynamics, works with his rival Seth frequently on engineering projects, and is an obvious direct opposite from his more street-wise mother and uncle. He turns to Joey as a big brother and substitute father figure, even after his biological father Jimmy re-enters mother Gina's love life.\n\n\n\n#### Bobbie Morganstern[edit]\n\n\n**Roberta \"Bobbie\" Morganstern** (Jennifer Coolidge) is Joey's oversexed agent whom he hires after Estelle Leonard's death, and reportedly the twelfth most powerful woman in Hollywood. She has an enormous crush on Joey's nephew Michael. She often entertains herself by making her office assistant do funny tricks, or shocking herself with a stun-gun. She is brash, forward, aggressive, highly entertaining and slightly ditzy, laughing at everything and at anyone's expense, including her client Joey's. She was once sued by Phil Collins.\n\n\n\n#### Howard[edit]\n\n\n**Howard** (Ben Falcone) is Joey's friend and neighbor in *Joey*.\n\n\n\n#### Zach Miller[edit]\n\n\n**Zach Miller** (Miguel A. Núñez Jr.) is an actor who joins the cast and becomes one of Joey's best friends in the second season of *Joey*. Zach has an interesting career, going from playing extras on TV, to directing amateur plays. Zach does not appear to have a home; he was seen at one time living in Joey's trailer while working on a major blockbuster movie. In one episode, Zach and Joey, both drunk, get married in Tijuana, in a parody of Ross and Rachel marrying each other in the season-five finale of *Friends*. Zach's final appearance was in \"Joey and the Big Move\". Núñez was absent from the last five episodes, including the finale of the series, because he found another job. Zach's absence within the show was not mentioned, nor was the character at all.\n\n\n\n## Characters recurring throughout series[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Character\n | Actor\n | Season\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 5\n | 6\n | 7\n | 8\n | 9\n | 10\n |\n| **Recurring characters** |\n| Gunther\n | James Michael Tyler | Recurring |\n| Janice Litman-Goralnik\n | Maggie Wheeler | Recurring | Guest | Recurring | Guest |\n| Carol Willick\n | Jane Sibbett[b] | Recurring | Guest | Recurring | Guest |  |\n| Judy Geller\n | Christina Pickles | Recurring | Guest | Recurring | Guest | Recurring | Guest |\n| Jack Geller\n | Elliott Gould | Recurring | Guest | Recurring | Guest | Recurring | Guest |\n| Susan Bunch\n | Jessica Hecht | Recurring | Guest |  | Guest |  |\n| Marcel\n | *Katie* | Recurring |  |\n| Barry Farber\n | Mitchell Whitfield | Recurring | Guest |  | Recurring |  |\n| Mr. Heckles\n | Larry Hankin | Recurring | Guest |  |\n| Paolo\n | Cosimo Fusco | Recurring | Guest |  |\n| Ben Geller\n | Cole Sprouse | Guest | Recurring | Guest | Recurring |  |\n| Estelle Leonard\n | June Gable | Guest | Recurring | Guest |  | Guest | Recurring | Guest |  | Guest |\n| Julie\n | Lauren Tom | Guest | Recurring |  |\n| Mindy Hunter\n | Jennifer GreyJana Marie Hupp | Guest |  |\n| Fun Bobby\n | Vincent Ventresca | Guest |  |\n| Terry\n | Max Wright | Guest |  |\n| Mr. Douglas\n | Dorien Wilson | Guest |  |\n| Jasmine\n | Cynthia Mann\n | Guest |  | Recurring | Guest |  |\n| Kiki\n | Michele Maika\n | Guest |  | Guest |  |\n| Nora Tyler Bing\n | Morgan Fairchild | Guest |  | Guest |  | Recurring | Guest |  |\n| David\n | Hank Azaria | Guest |  | Guest |  | Recurring |  |\n| Steve\n | Jon Lovitz | Guest |  | Guest |  |\n| Frank Buffay Jr.\n | Giovanni Ribisi |  | Recurring | Guest |  | Guest |\n| Richard Burke\n | Tom Selleck |  | Recurring | Guest |  | Recurring |  |\n| Mr. Treeger\n | Michael G.

Subsequent episodes featured Sibbett in the role.\n\nEach of the following characters of *Friends* may or may not be particularly significant to the story of the series; each was introduced in one season and would usually appear in subsequent seasons.\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 1[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 1)\n\n#### Gunther[edit]\n\n\n**Gunther** (James Michael Tyler): The manager of the Central Perk coffee house, who first appears as a background character in \"The One with the Sonogram at the End\".[25] He is a former actor who once played Bryce on *All My Children* before that character was \"killed in an avalanche.\"[e 5] Gunther develops an unrequited crush on Rachel in the third season, which he keeps to himself until \"The Last One\".[e 4] Apart from Ross, whom he dislikes, he is on reasonably good terms with the rest of the gang despite occasionally being annoyed by wacky antics or comments from them. His motivation for disliking Ross is jealousy (as he is aware of Ross's relationship with Rachel), which is made clear numerous times, most notably in \"The One with the Morning After\" when he reveals to Rachel that Ross slept with another woman while Rachel was on a break from their relationship.[e 6] Gunther appears in a majority of the episodes, but only occasionally calls attention to himself and almost never has a large role in the plot of an episode. In \"The One with The Stain\",[e 7] Gunther is shown to be fluent in Dutch (although with a strong American accent), calling Ross an \"ezel\" as he converses with him.\n\n\nJames Michael Tyler was cast as Gunther because he was the only extra who could competently work the cappuccino machine on the Central Perk set. Tyler appears as Gunther in a co-host voice-over in the *Friends* trivia game for PS2, PC and Xbox, and in the board game *Friends: Scene It?*. *The Seattle Times* ranked Gunther as the eighth best guest character of the series in 2004.[26] When asked in 2009 by Heatworld.com what Gunther would be doing \"now\", Tyler joked, \"He'd probably have a very traditional marriage, with lots of white-haired babies running around with hair brighter than the sun.\"[27] Aside from the main cast, he appears in the most episodes.\n\n\n\n#### Jack and Judy Geller[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Elliott Gould portrayed Jack Geller, Ross and Monica's father, in 20 episodes, spanning from 1994 to 2003.\n**Jack** (Elliott Gould) and **Judy Geller** (Christina Pickles): Ross and Monica's parents. In early appearances, Jack frequently makes inappropriate comments, which he punctuates by exclaiming \"I'm just *saying*...!\", while Judy makes condescending remarks about Monica's lack of a love life and sometimes forgets her daughter even exists, while overtly favoring Ross. Jack is more balanced in his attention and care towards both Ross and Monica, though after the Gellers sell their house in season 7, it is revealed that Jack used boxes of Monica's old stuff to block rainwater from getting to his Porsche. As penance, Jack decides to gift Monica the Porsche.\n\n\nDespite each of them having their own quirks, they are occasionally dumbfounded by the crazy antics of their son and daughter, such as Ross' disastrous wedding to Emily and Monica's ridiculous speech at their 35th anniversary party. They are also sometimes bemused by the antics of the other four friends, such as idiotic or crazy comments from Phoebe and Joey, a revolting trifle cooked by Rachel, and Chandler entering a coed whirlpool alongside Jack without wearing anything underneath the towel wrapped around his waist. In the season 10 episode The One with The Cake, the couple record a message for their granddaughter's 18th birthday in which they state they might not be around by then.\n\n\nPickles was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her appearance in \"The One Where Nana Dies Twice\" in 1995.[e 8][*failed verification*] In 2004, *The Seattle Times* ranked Jack and Judy jointly as the second best guest characters of the series.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Barry Farber[edit]\n\n\n**Barry Farber** (Mitchell Whitfield): Rachel's jilted fiancé. Barry, an orthodontist, decides to go on his and Rachel's honeymoon with her maid of honor Mindy, and soon begins a relationship with her. Their relationship hits a rough patch when he and Rachel consider getting back together.[e 9] He decides to stay with Mindy, and the two are later married. Rachel is invited to the wedding, but receives a cold reception for jilting Barry while she is there, and a ridiculous speech from Ross which bemuses everyone in the room does not exactly improve the situation for her, until she, in a desperate attempt to salvage some pride, walks onto the stage where the microphone is and starts singing the Copacabana.[e 10] In the episode \"The One That Could Have Been Part 1\" Rachel mentions that Barry and Mindy have divorced after five years, when Mindy found out he was cheating on her.[e 11] Barry's last name is given as \"Finkle\" in the pilot[e 3] and \"Farber\" in every other appearance except in \"The One with the Flashback\",[e 12] where he is referred to as \"Barry Barber\". He has also been called \"Barry White\", and is possibly[*original research?*] named as an homage to long-time NY talk show host Barry Farber.\n\n\n\n#### Carol Willick and Susan Bunch[edit]\n\n\n\n**Carol Willick** (Anita Barone for the character's debut episode, Jane Sibbett thereafter) and **Susan Bunch** (Jessica Hecht): Carol is Ross' lesbian ex-wife, who came out before the pilot, and Susan is her partner. Carol divorced Ross to be with Susan. In the second episode of the series, Carol tells Ross that she is pregnant with his child,[e 13] and is having the baby with her partner Susan, though she wishes Ross to be part of the baby's life. Carol and Susan are often bemused by Ross' behavior throughout his onscreen appearances with them. Though Ross and Carol are on good terms after their divorce, Ross resents Susan for losing Carol to her.[e 14] Although Susan and Ross are initially, naturally enough, often at odds, they briefly put aside their differences when Carol gives birth to a boy, whom they all agree, after weeks of argument, to name Ben.[e 15] Carol and Susan announce their plans to get married in \"The One with the Lesbian Wedding\", but Carol's parents refuse to attend the wedding, leading Carol to doubt her decision. Ross initially hesitant to see his ex-wife remarry, finds himself in the position of being the one to encourage her to go ahead with the ceremony despite her parents' opposition. At the reception, Susan thanks Ross for his part in saving the wedding, and offers to dance with him; he agrees, apparently resolving their strained relationship.[e 16] Carol and Susan make irregular appearances until \"The One That Could Have Been\" (Susan),[e 11] and \"The One with the Truth About London\" (Carol).\n\n\nCarol and Susan were based on creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane's best friends in New York: \"We didn't create them for any particular political reason or because of lesbian chic. It was just an opportunity to tell a really interesting story.\"[28] The characters were called a positive example of a gay couple on television by GLAAD. Jessica Hecht originally auditioned to play Monica.[29]\n\n\n\n#### Marcel[edit]\n\n\n**Marcel** (live animal actor): A Capuchin monkey that Ross initially keeps as a pet,[e 17] and who provides comic relief for his geeky master. One time Rachel loses him in the city,[e 18] and calls Animal Control—only to learn from Ross that Marcel is an illegal exotic animal that cannot be kept in the city. After unsuccessfully trying to prevent animal control officer Luisa (Megan Cavanagh) from discovering that they are harboring an illegal exotic animal and bemusing her with their wacky behavior throughout these unsuccessful attempts, Rachel, Monica, Ross and Phoebe learn that Luisa is a former classmate of Rachel's and Monica's who upon recognizing Rachel attempts to spite her for snubbing her in high school by attempting to confiscate Marcel. To prevent this, Rachel threatens to tell Luisa's boss about how she shot Phoebe \"in the ass with a dart\" that had been meant for Marcel. Later, as Marcel sexually matures and begins to hump everything, Ross has to give him away to a zoo[e 19]—\"where he can have access to regular monkey-lovin'.\" Ultimately, Ross finds out that Marcel then got stolen from the zoo and taken into a life of show business, and—after starring in a liquor commercial—is starring in a movie in New York,[e 20] where they are reunited one last time. In a later season Ross questions why he had a monkey as a pet, and in another episode is mentioned during an argument with Joey. Despite Marcel being male, in reality the monkey was a female called Katie.\n\n\n\n#### Janice Litman-Goralnik[edit]\n\n\n\n**Janice Litman-Goralnik** (née **Hosenstein**) (Maggie Wheeler): Chandler's on-again, off-again girlfriend for the first four seasons. Janice is one of the few supporting characters who appears in all of the *Friends* seasons (along with Gunther and Ross and Monica's parents). She has a distinctive nasal voice, a machine gun laugh, and a thick New York accent, all of which annoy the friends, especially Joey. She first appears in \"The One with the East German Laundry Detergent\",[e 21] when Chandler breaks up with her (through Phoebe); he then invites her to New Year's in a moment of weakness, only to dump her again before midnight.[e 17] She then shows up as Chandler's blind date the night before Valentine's Day where they sleep together; Chandler breaks up with her the next day but she is fine with it, telling him she knows they will meet again.[e 22] In season two, in the wake of Mr. Heckles' death, Chandler resolves not to die alone and calls Janice, but is disappointed to discover that she is married and pregnant.[e 23] In \"The One with Barry and Mindy's Wedding\", Chandler arranges a meeting with a mystery woman over the Internet, who turns out to be Janice, who reveals that her husband is having an affair with his secretary and that they are divorcing.[e 10] To the surprise of the others, and to Joey's indignance, Chandler stays with Janice through the beginning of the third season, having fallen in love with her and no longer finding her annoying. Joey later sees Janice kissing her husband Gary while in the midst of their divorce[e 24] and tells Chandler. Chandler confronts Janice, who admits that she loves both men. However, Joey implies to Chandler that were he in his position, he would not try to interfere with Janice being happy with the father of her child. This, combined with Chandler's lingering trauma from his own parents' divorce, leads to the end of their relationship in \"The One with the Giant Poking Device\" when Chandler urges Janice to go back to her husband, not wanting to destroy her family.[e 25]\n\n\nFollowing this, Janice becomes a running gag on the show, appearing in some form in one episode per season (two in season 8 when counting \"The One Where Rachel Has a Baby\" as two separate episodes) from season 4 onwards. When Janice returns to Chandler's life, having finally gotten divorced after her reconciliation fell through, Chandler finds her insufferable again, and pretends to move to Yemen to get away from her.[e 26] In season five, Janice has a brief fling with Ross shortly after he has broken up with Emily, where he spends the entire date complaining about everything, causing her to find him insufferable and leave him, with the irony of the situation quickly dawning on him and persuading him to get his act together; she then implies to Joey that she will date him next.[e 27] She later makes a voice cameo on a mix tape that Chandler plays for Monica, having passed it off as his own and not knowing Janice had made it for him.[e 28] When Chandler and Monica become engaged, Janice re-enters their lives and, now mostly over Chandler, attempts to forcibly invite herself to the wedding; she only leaves when Monica states that Chandler still has feelings for her.[e 29] When Ross and Rachel await the birth of their daughter Emma in season 8, Janice and her new, partially-deaf husband Sid are placed in the same labor room as Rachel; she gives birth to a son, Aaron, who she jokes will be Emma's future husband. She also strongly advises Rachel that Ross will not stay around to raise the baby if they are not married, citing how her own ex-husband is largely estranged from their daughter.[e 30] In season 9, as Monica and Chandler make plans to have children, they go to a fertility clinic where Janice and Sid are coincidentally visiting; when Chandler worries about his sperm, she offers Chandler advice and support.[e 31] In season 10, Janice and her family come close to buying a house next door to the one Monica and Chandler are buying; to get rid of her, Chandler once again pretends he still loves her, causing her to become fearful that they will end up ruining their marriages if she lives next door to him, so she decides not to buy the house after all. She leaves, seemingly for good, but does kiss him one last time before she goes.[e 32]\n\n\nThroughout the series, Janice enjoys spending time with the six friends, which is ironic and very inconvenient for them, since none of them can stand to be around her.[*original research?*] She utters her catchphrase, \"*Ohhh—myyy—Gawd!*\", almost every time she re-enters the show, and Chandler sometimes imitates her with it. Janice's distinctive laugh was born out of a slip-up Wheeler made during the rehearsal of \"The One with the East German Laundry Detergent\";[e 21] after Chandler and Janice's \"More latte?\"/\"No, I'm still working on mine\" lines, Wheeler laughed.[30] *The Seattle Times* ranked Janice as the best guest character of the series in 2004.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Mr. Heckles[edit]\n\n\n**Mr. Heckles** (Larry Hankin): Monica and Rachel's downstairs neighbor, a domineering, highly unusual elderly man who constantly complains about the noise, even though the six friends are being perfectly decent in volume whenever he claims that they are disturbing him. His reason for this is never revealed, until \"The One Where Mr Heckles Dies\", in which the group discover that the noises being made in their apartment are apparently amplified in his, and when Chandler hears banging coming from the above room while in Heckles' apartment (although it is never revealed exactly what the people upstairs were doing to cause the banging) it annoys him so much that he inadvertently imitates Heckles by banging on the roof with his broom.[e 23] He appears in \"The One with Two Parts, Part 1\"[e 33] and \"The One Where the Monkey Gets Away\"[e 18] before dying in \"The One Where Mr. Heckles Dies\".[e 23] As a last spiteful act, he leaves all of his junk to \"the noisy girls in the apartment above mine\". He makes a final cameo appearance in \"The One with the Flashback\",[e 12] set in 1993, where he complains that Phoebe's noise is disturbing his oboe practice (even though he does not actually play the oboe), and inadvertently (and cruelly) causes Joey to be Chandler's roommate. He usually states that items are his, and when the other person states that he does not have one, Mr. Heckles says that he could have one. For instance, when Rachel and Phoebe are searching for the owner of a lost cat, Mr. Heckles said \"Yes, that's my cat.\" They told him he did not have a cat, to which he responded \"I could have a cat.\"\nHe also likes to bang on the ceiling with a broom when he feels people are being too loud. This appears to be how he dies when, according to Mr. Treeger, Mr. Heckles died of a heart attack, while 'sweeping'.\nHis first appearance in the series was in season 1, \"The One with the Blackout\", where he is credited simply \"as the Weird Man\".\n\n\n\n#### Paolo[edit]\n\n\n**Paolo** (Cosimo Fusco): an Italian neighbor in Rachel's building, who Rachel meets and hooks up with in \"The One with the Blackout\".[e 34] They start dating, making Ross jealous. She dumps him after he gropes Phoebe[e 35] but has a last one-night stand with him in \"The One with Ross's New Girlfriend\".[e 36] In the Italian version of the show, Paolo's name is changed to Pablo and his nationality is Spanish.\n\n\n\n#### Terry[edit]\n\n\n**Terry** (Max Wright): the original manager at Central Perk before Gunther takes the title, who does not hide the fact that he thinks Rachel is a terrible waitress and Phoebe is \"*so* bad\" as a musician. He denies Rachel an advance on her wages in \"The One Where Underdog Gets Away\"[e 37] and hires a professional musician, Stephanie Schiffer (played by Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders), to replace Phoebe in \"The One with the Baby on the Bus\".[e 38] He is last mentioned in \"The One Where Rachel Quits\", where he asks Rachel to retake the waitress training through Gunther, and when Rachel quits midway through the training, he promptly hires a new and more experienced waitress. He presumably retires in season 4 and from this point onwards Gunther becomes the sole manager at Central Perk. The role of Terry was intended by the NBC producers to be much bigger. They saw him as an older character who would provide advice to the six friends but NBC were talked out of it by the show's creators.\n\n\n\n#### Fun Bobby[edit]\n\n\n**\"Fun Bobby\"** (**Robert**) (Vincent Ventresca): Monica's alcoholic boyfriend. In his first appearance in \"The One with the Monkey\",[e 17] his \"fun\" is sapped at Monica's New Year's party after his grandfather died, but his depression does not stop Monica, annoyed that he's \"bringing her party down\" from putting a party horn in his mouth and forcing him to blow on it, to his bemusement. In \"The One with Russ\",[e 39] the gang discovers that alcohol puts the \"fun\" into Fun Bobby. Monica tries to wean him off drinking but regrets it when he becomes extremely boring. Monica then begins drinking on their dates, so that she could sit through his mind-numbingly dull stories. Bobby then breaks up with Monica, stating that he is not strong enough for a co-dependent relationship. It is revealed in the episode \"The One with Phoebe's Husband\" that the underwear on the telephone pole was Monica's when she was having sex with Fun Bobby on the terrace.[e 40]\n\n\n\n#### David[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hank Azaria played David, Phoebe's recurring love interest, in 1994, 2001 and 2003.\n**David**, \"the Scientist Guy\" (Hank Azaria): a physicist with whom Phoebe falls in love in \"The One with the Monkey\", when he receives an academic grant for a three-year research trip to Minsk (incorrectly—and consistently—described in the scripts as being in Russia, rather than Belarus).[e 17] After a quarrel with his research partner Max (Wayne Pére), Phoebe urges him to take the trip, even though it breaks her heart. Seven years later, he returns to New York for a brief visit and shares an evening with Phoebe, at the end of which he wants to say he loves her, but chooses not to as it will make it harder for him to leave.[e 41] Two years later, he returns for another visit in \"The One with the Male Nanny\", where he kisses Phoebe before she admits she is seeing Mike Hannigan, who catches them together.[e 42] He returns permanently in \"The One with the Donor\", having failed in his research, and when he finds out that Phoebe and Mike have broken up, he and Phoebe begin dating again.[e 43] In \"The One in Barbados—Part 1\", David proposes to Phoebe but is turned down in favor of Mike.[e 44]\n\n\nIn 2003, Azaria was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance.[31] Azaria originally auditioned for the role of Joey.[32]\n\n\n\n#### Nora Tyler Bing[edit]\n\n\n**Nora Tyler Bing** (Morgan Fairchild): Chandler's mother, a best-selling erotic novelist whose works include *Euphoria Unbound*, *Euphoria At Midnight* and *Mistress Bitch*. She first appears in \"The One with Mrs. Bing\",[e 45] where she meets the gang while on a book tour in New York. After dinner, she kisses Ross. She makes a cameo appearance in the flashback scenes of \"The One with All the Thanksgivings\"[e 46] and later appears in \"The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding\" (with Kathleen Turner as Chandler's dad)[e 47] and \"The One After 'I Do'\".[e 48] *The Seattle Times* ranked Nora and her ex-husband jointly as the fifth best guest characters in 2004.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Ursula Buffay[edit]\n\n\nFictional character\n\n\n\n| Ursula Buffay |\n| --- |\n| *Friends, Mad About You* character |\n| First appearance | \"Married to the Job\" (1993)(*Mad About You*) |\n| Last appearance | \"The One with the Halloween Party\" (2001)(*Friends*) |\n| Portrayed by | Lisa Kudrow |\n| In-universe information |\n| Occupation | WaitressPornographic actress |\n| Family | Frank Buffay, Sr. (father)Phoebe Abbott (birth mother)Lily Buffay (adoptive mother)Phoebe Buffay (twin sister)Frank Buffay, Jr. (half-brother)Frances (grandmother)Frank Buffay, Jr., Jr. (nephew)Leslie Buffay (niece)Chandler Buffay (niece) |\n\n\n**Ursula Pamela Buffay** (Lisa Kudrow): Phoebe's identical twin sister who lives in SoHo. Kudrow originated the role of Ursula in the sitcom *Mad About You*, playing her as an inept waitress at Riff's who frequently forgets orders.[m 1] Ursula is every bit as odd as Phoebe is, but, unlike her sister, Ursula is a selfish, amoral, abrasive, brazen and hedonistic individual who is so self-absorbed and self-centered that she often forgets things, usually treats Phoebe with disdain and is not liked by anyone who truly knows her. Phoebe refers to Ursula as her \"evil twin\". She first appears in *Friends* in \"The One with Two Parts\":[e 33] Chandler and Joey are eating at Riff's and mistake Ursula for Phoebe. Joey becomes attracted to Ursula and they start dating. Ursula tells Phoebe that she is bored with Joey and claims that he is smart enough to figure this out on his own without her having to actually tell him, so Phoebe pretends to be her sister to let Joey down gently. In the same episode, Helen Hunt and Leila Kenzle cameo as their *Mad About You* characters Jamie Buchman and Fran Devanow, in a scene where they mistake Phoebe for Ursula in Central Perk. Ursula next appears briefly in \"The One with the Jam\",[e 49] where she is being stalked by Malcolm (David Arquette) who mistakes Phoebe for her. Phoebe naively begins a relationship with the man in question, but ends it with him when he cannot get over his obsession with Ursula. In \"The One with the Jellyfish\"[e 50] Phoebe tells Ursula that she has met their birth mother (Teri Garr), but Ursula already knows about her. In \"The One Where Chandler Can't Cry\",[e 51] Phoebe starts getting unwanted attention from men, and discovers that Ursula is starring in pornographic films using Phoebe's name, including a film called *Buffay The Vampire Layer*. Phoebe gets revenge by claiming Ursula's paychecks and embarrassing her many male fans. Flashbacks in \"The One Where They All Turn Thirty\"[e 52] reveal that Ursula sold Phoebe's birth certificate to a Swedish runaway, and that both sisters are thirty-one, not thirty. In \"The One with the Halloween Party\",[e 53] Ursula introduces Phoebe to Eric (Sean Penn), her fiancé. Phoebe is horrified that Ursula has lied to Eric that she is a teacher, a member of the Peace Corps, a non-smoker, and attends a church group; so she tells Eric the truth, upon which he breaks up with Ursula. The series finale of *Mad About You*, set 22 years into the future, reveals that Ursula becomes Governor of New York.[m 2]\n\n\n\n#### Mindy Hunter-Farber[edit]\n\n\n\n**Mindy Hunter-Farber** (Jennifer Grey in \"The One with the Evil Orthodontist\",[e 9] Jana Marie Hupp in \"The One with Barry and Mindy's Wedding\"[e 10]): Rachel's maid of honor at her abortive wedding to Barry. Mindy and Rachel were best friends while growing up and their friendship is tested after Rachel discovers Mindy and Barry are seeing each other. She asks Rachel to be her maid of honor and dress in a garish pink dress. Mindy marries Barry in \"The One with Barry and Mindy's Wedding\";[e 10] but he later cheats on her and she has divorced him by \"The One That Could Have Been, Part 1\".[e 11]\n\n\n\n#### Ben Geller[edit]\n\n\n**Ben Geller** (Various actors, 1995–1999; Cole Sprouse, 2000–2002): Ross and Carol's son, born during \"The One with the Birth\".[e 15] Ben is played as an infant by Michael Gunderson, by brothers Charles Thomas Allen and John Christopher Allen from season 3 to 5, and by Sprouse from season 6 to 8.\n\n\n\n#### Julie[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lauren Tom played Julie.\n**Julie** (Lauren Tom): an old graduate school colleague of Ross, whom he meets again while on a trip to China; she first appears in the final scene of the season 1 finale.[e 54] They start dating but break up soon after, when Ross reveals he loves Rachel.[e 55] During the entire time Julie and Ross were dating, Rachel hated the relationship because about a week before Ross came home from China, Rachel discovered that Ross was in love with her. This made Rachel's feelings for Ross grow at a fast rate, making her jealous of Julie's relationship with him. At the end \"The One with Russ\", Julie returns and falls in love with Ross' doppelgänger Russ, with the episodes' writer describing them as still being together by 2020. The scene where Rachel speaks slowly to Julie at the airport was based upon the real-life experience of actress Lauren Tom.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Steve[edit]\n\n\n**Steve** (Jon Lovitz): a restaurant owner and drug addict whom Phoebe knows. In 1995, Monica tries to impress him in an attempt to get a job at his restaurant, and Phoebe tells him he is welcome to go to her apartment and try her food there, but he gets stoned on the journey there and consequently acts obnoxious. At the end of the episode, Phoebe punishes him by giving him a very painful massage.[e 56] His drug problem eventually causes him to lose his restaurant, and, in 2003, Phoebe later fixes Rachel up with him (and Ross with nobody) on a blind date, as part of a secret strategy to get Rachel and Ross back together.[e 57]\n\n\n\n#### Ugly Naked Guy[edit]\n\n\n**Ugly Naked Guy** (Jon Haugen): A tenant in the apartment in the building across from Monica's apartment—who frequently, perhaps invariably, is naked with the drapes open—so the gang is frequently commenting on his activities—playing cello, wearing \"gravity boots\", etc. He is first mentioned in the second episode of the series,[e 13] but only appears twice: first, his belly and an arm are shown in \"The One with the Giant Poking Device\"[e 25]—in which he is being poked from across the street by the gang (who think he is dead) with a long device made from chopsticks; second, a rear view of him from head to waist is shown in \"The One Where Everybody Finds Out\"[e 58] (his final show)—in which he is moving out of his apartment and Ross tries to get the apartment by ingratiating himself with Ugly Naked Guy by cavorting with him in the nude. (In \"The One with the Flashback\",[e 12] it is learned that he used to be \"Hot Naked Guy\", but then, in 1993, started putting on weight).\n\n\nFor many years, the identity of the actor that played him in his extremely limited appearances was a mystery. It was speculated that Michael G. Hagerty, the actor who played Mr. Treeger, was Ugly Naked Guy. However, Hagerty denied this theory. On May 31, 2016, an article was published by Todd Van Luling in *The Huffington Post*, detailing his search for the identity of Ugly Naked Guy. His article revealed that an actor named Jon Haugen played the role.[33]\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 2[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 2)\n\n#### Mr. Treeger[edit]\n\n\n**Mr. Treeger** (Michael G. Hagerty): the superintendent of Monica's building, who first appears in \"The One Where Heckles Dies\",[e 23] when he shows Mr. Heckles's lawyer to Monica and Rachel's apartment. He next appears in \"The One with Phoebe's Dad\",[e 59] in which Ross thinks he is soliciting a bribe to fix Monica and Rachel's broken radiator (after they gave cookies instead of cash as Christmas tips and angered most of the servicepeople), when in fact Treeger actually appreciated the personal touch of the cookies. In season 4, when Joey rebuffs him for (gently) insulting Rachel in a moment of pique,[e 60] he threatens to have Monica and Rachel evicted unless Joey helps him practice ballroom dancing to impress a woman. In \"The One with the Free Porn\",[e 61] he cleans the shower drain of Chandler and Joey's newly won apartment, and warns them never to turn off their TV after they start receiving free porn. In his final on-screen appearance,[e 62] he has a fireman break down the door to Monica's apartment after Joey tells him he smells gas while she and Chandler are away on their honeymoon.\n\n\n\n#### Estelle Leonard[edit]\n\n\n**Estelle Leonard** (June Gable): Joey's talent agent. She is usually seen wearing colorful clothes, heavy make-up, and a bouffant. She chain smokes and has a strong New York accent. Gable's first appearance as Estelle, in \"The One with the Butt\",[e 63] was cut for time, though the character appears off-screen when she signs Joey and lands him his first film role, playing Al Pacino's butt-double. The cut scene is included in the episode's DVD release. Her first on-screen appearance comes in season 2's \"The One with Russ\",[e 39] where she gets Joey a recurring part in *Days of Our Lives*. Although she is shown to be supportive of Joey's career throughout the show, in \"The One Where Joey Loses His Health Insurance\"[e 64] it is suggested she has instead been bad-mouthing him after mistakenly assuming he has found another agent. She dies in the final season,[e 32] and Joey speaks at her memorial service, where it is revealed that by that point she represented only two clients — Joey and a man whose act is eating paper.\n\n\nWhen Gable auditioned for the role, she played Estelle quite plainly and was encouraged to \"go away and do something with her\". She returned to the audition room wearing a \"fat suit\" and eating a sandwich from a delicatessen, which she stubbed out a cigarette on. The performance was used in the deleted scene of \"The One with the Butt\".[e 63] Her age is never given but Gable believed that she was in her 80s.[34] In 2004, *The Seattle Times* ranked Estelle as the sixth-best guest character of the series.[26] Gable also plays the nurse who delivers Ben in \"The One with the Birth\".\n\n\n\n#### Richard Burke[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tom Selleck played Monica's boyfriend Dr. Richard Burke in several episodes between 1995 and 2000.\n**Dr. Richard Burke** (Tom Selleck): an ophthalmologist and close friend of Jack Geller. Richard is introduced when Monica caters an event for him in \"The One Where Ross and Rachel … You Know\".,[e 65] and they begin dating despite their 21-year age difference. Ross is initially upset, but becomes supportive of their relationship, especially when Monica decides to tell their parents. This does not go well at first, but even Monica's parents have to admit that they've never seen Richard happier and that he's not just \"fooling around\" with a younger woman.[e 66] He and Monica break up in \"The One with Barry and Mindy's Wedding\"[e 10] when he tells her he does not want more children, his own having already grown up (and had children of their own). Despite the two still being in love, they cannot reconcile this difference, and are both devastated for months. He makes a brief voice cameo in \"The One Where No One's Ready\",[e 67] and later they briefly attempt to rekindle their romance as \"friends\" before accepting that the reasons they broke up remain valid.[e 68] In \"The One in Vegas\", Monica and Richard bump into each other off-screen and have lunch together. Monica does not feel anything for Richard but refrains from telling Chandler because of their upcoming anniversary. When he learns the truth, they fight for most of the episode until Monica assures Chandler that she will never see Richard again. In \"The One with the Proposal\",[e 69] he runs into Monica and Chandler at dinner. While Chandler is planning to propose but pretends to be against marriage because he \"wants it to be a surprise\", Richard stuns Monica by telling her that he still loves her, and wants to marry her and have kids with her. Monica rejects him but later arrives at his apartment, frustrated with her own situation. She complains to him for a bit about how bad things are going in her love life before leaving to think things over. Eventually, Chandler comes to his apartment searching for Monica and tells Richard of his own proposal plan. Richard seems to lack sympathy for Chandler at first, responding to Chandler explaining away his plan to make her initially think he was against marriage by stating it had \"worked very well\" but when Chandler angrily tells him he has no right to ruin another man's relationship with her because he's already ruined his own, he realizes Chandler is right and tells him, \"You go get her, Chandler. And can I give you a bit of advice? If you get her, don't let her go. Trust me\" — noting that he hates the fact that he is a nice guy when Chandler thanks him. His apartment is put up for sale in season 9, in \"The One with Ross's Inappropriate Song\",[e 70] but Richard is not seen. While there, Chandler finds out that Richard made a sex tape with Monica which he steals and watches, but he and Monica later discover that Richard taped over her, relieving Chandler but leaving Monica feeling insulted.\n\n\nAll of Selleck's entrances in season 2 had to be refilmed after the audience left because \"it was like The Beatles with the screaming and the applause\".[35] Selleck was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series[36] in 2000 for his appearance in \"The One with the Proposal\". In 2004, *The Seattle Times* ranked Richard as the third-best guest character of the series.[26]\n\n\n\n\n#### Sandra Green[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Marlo Thomas played Sandra Green, Rachel, Jill and Amy's mother, who divorced Rachel's father in season 2, and appears in various episodes from then on.\n**Sandra Green** (Marlo Thomas): Rachel's overprotective mother. In \"The One with the Lesbian Wedding\",[e 16] she announces to Rachel that she never loved Rachel's father and is divorcing him. (\"You didn't marry your Barry, honey—but *I* married *mine*.\") She later accompanies everyone to Carol and Susan's wedding. In \"The One with the Two Parties\",[e 71] she arrives at Rachel's birthday party and is unaware for the whole night that her ex-husband is also there, as the six friends successfully prevent them from finding out each other are there by setting up two different parties, bemusing them both with their strange, wacky behavior in the process; Joey even ends up kissing Sandra to distract her from her ex-husband's departure. In \"The One with the Baby Shower\",[e 72] she is invited at the last minute to attend Rachel's baby shower, where she offers to move in with Ross and Rachel to help with the baby's first months; Rachel first accepts, then Ross makes her change her mind. When Rachel was planning to move to Paris, Sandra would fly out with Emma a few days later. However this never happens as Rachel chooses to remain in New York with Ross.\n\n\nFor her appearance in \"The One with the Lesbian Wedding\", Thomas was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 1996.[37]\n\n\n\n#### Frances[edit]\n\n\n**Frances** (Audra Lindley): Phoebe's grandmother by her mother Lily. Her only appearance is in \"The One with Phoebe's Dad\",[e 59] where she reveals to Phoebe that the person in the pictures she keeps around the house is not Phoebe's father, which motivates Phoebe to try to track down her real father. When Phoebe leaves Frances’ house to go and find her father, she kisses goodbye to a picture of her \"grandfather\", which is in fact a picture of Albert Einstein. Though the character appears in only one episode, she is mentioned in a few more, including in season 5's \"The One with Joey's Bag\",[e 73] where it is revealed that she has recently died and Phoebe plans her funeral. Phoebe inherits her grandmother's yellow taxi and apartment. She keeps the taxi until the very end of the series.\n\n\n\n#### Frank Buffay Jr.[edit]\n\n\n\n**Frank Buffay Jr.** (Giovanni Ribisi): Phoebe and Ursula's half-brother by their father. In \"The One with the Bullies\",[e 74] Phoebe meets him after finding the courage to knock on her father's suburban door, but learns from Frank Jr.'s mother (played by Laraine Newman) that her father walked out several years ago. Despite not finding her father, she connects with Frank Jr. who later visits the city[e 75] where he hits on Jasmine, one of Phoebe's coworkers, and mistakes her massage parlor for a whorehouse. He eventually falls in love with and becomes engaged to Alice Knight (Debra Jo Rupp), his former home-economics teacher who is 26 years his senior.[e 76] In \"The One with Phoebe's Uterus\",[e 1] Frank and Alice ask Phoebe to be a surrogate mother for their child, and she later gives birth to their triplets, whom she then says goodbye to in an emotional scene in \"The One Hundredth\".[e 2] Frank makes a final appearance in \"The One Where Ross is Fine\",[e 77] when he and the triplets meet Phoebe at Central Perk. In the episode, he claims he \"hasn't slept in four years\" and is so exhausted with raising the triplets he even proposed that Phoebe take one for her own. However, he soon realizes he loves his children too much to give any of them up; Phoebe proposes to start babysitting them so that Frank and Alice can enjoy some more time off.\n\n\nPreviously, Ribisi appeared in \"The One with the Baby on the Bus\" as a stranger who leaves a condom rather than money in Phoebe's guitar case when she is singing on the street, then comes back to retrieve it. It was never addressed if this was intended to be the same character as Frank, who had not yet been introduced by name.[e 38]\n\n\nIn 2004, *The Seattle Times* ranked Frank as the fourth-best guest character of the series.[26] Alice was only scheduled to appear in the one episode but was brought back for a recurring role after the surrogacy storyline—which was created when actor Lisa Kudrow became pregnant.[38]\n\n\n\n#### Leonard Green[edit]\n\n\n**Dr. Leonard Green** (Ron Leibman): Rachel, Jill and Amy's father, a surly, abrasive and rather amoral vascular surgeon; although he is genuinely affectionate and usually good-natured towards his daughter, he is generally a mean-spirited, nasty and disrespectful bully who is quick to insult anyone who, even by accident, irritates him in the slightest way, even if an insult was not intended. He takes an instant dislike to his daughter's boyfriend Ross when the latter refers to Green's profession as \"a game\".[e 71] Later, when Ross and Rachel conceive a child (Emma), he becomes furious that they're not engaged because he does not want his grandchild to be a bastard and ends up going to Ross' apartment and shouting at him because Rachel (who is afraid of Leonard's anger) lied to him and claimed that Ross refused to ask her to marry him, leading Rachel to eventually clarify the situation for him. However, he is still angry at her and believes love to be insignificant in a marriage.[e 78] He has a heart attack in \"The One Where Joey Speaks French\"[e 79] and is recovering in the hospital when Rachel arrives with Ross, who he once again treated with contempt.\n\n\nAlthough Leonard, like his daughter Amy, was a deliberately unpleasant and unlikeable character, the comic relief he provided caused him, again like his daughter Amy, to become memorable as a character fans[*clarification needed*] \"loved to hate.\"[*original research?*] As of 2020, Ron Leibman is the only one of the actors playing the group's parents to have died.\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 3[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 3)\n\n#### Mark Robinson[edit]\n\n\n**Mark Robinson** (Steven Eckholdt) first appears in \"The One Where Chandler Can't Remember Which Sister\", offering to get Rachel an interview at Bloomingdale's after overhearing her complaining to Monica about her current job. Ross is immediately jealous of Mark, and this, combined with Rachel's staggering obliviousness to Mark's obvious crush on her, puts a strain on their relationship, as Ross overcompensates by smothering Rachel. Although Mark quits Bloomingdale's for a different job in \"The One with Phoebe's Ex-Partner\", he and Rachel make plans to attend a fashion seminar together. After Ross and Rachel fight and Rachel suggests \"taking a break,\" Mark insists, over Rachel's protests, on coming to her apartment to comfort her (doing the same thing she had been mad at Ross for doing: not listening to her wishes and doing whatever he wants); when Ross calls and overhears Mark's voice, he mistakenly believes Mark is there to have sex with Rachel and, believing that their relationship is now over, gets drunk and sleeps with Chloe.[e 80] Weeks after their breakup, Mark asks Rachel on a date and she accepts, but she ultimately rejects his advances when she realizes she only accepted to get back at Ross.[e 81] After saying that he will \"get back at [Ross]\" by himself later, Mark is not seen again until season 10, \"The One with Princess Consuela\",[e 82] where he encounters Rachel and Ross after she has been fired from Ralph Lauren, and takes her out to dinner where he offers her a new job with Louis Vuitton in Paris. Ross fails to recognize him but becomes hostile all over again once reminded, even declaring his extreme hatred of Mark and forbids Rachel of going to dinner with him and with both of Ross and Rachel's breakups in seasons 3 and 4, oddly being unmentioned. It is also revealed that since his previous appearance he has married and had kids (twins, actually) – once informed of this, an embarrassed Ross wonders: \"Should we send something?\" Though Ross attempts to counter Mark's job offer by getting Rachel her job back at Ralph Lauren, he eventually relents upon realizing Rachel wants to go to Paris. However, when Ross confesses to Rachel at the airport that he is still in love with her, Rachel gets off the plane at the last minute to reunite with him, turning down Mark's job offer.\n\n\n\n#### Sophie[edit]\n\n\n**Sophie** (Laura Dean): Mark's replacement. Sophie is frequently abused by her boss Joanna and occasionally bewildered by ridiculous comments from Chandler (who had a brief relationship with Joanna). In the episode \"The One Where They're Going to *Party!*\",[e 83] she is ecstatic about Joanna's death.\n\n\n\n#### Joanna[edit]\n\n\n**Joanna** (Alison LaPlaca): Rachel's boss, who despite being occasionally bewildered by his ridiculous comments, dates Chandler in two episodes (once in season 3,[e 84] once in season 4[e 85]). She is hostile to her assistant, Sophie, but usually good-natured towards Rachel. After deliberately sabotaging Rachel's promotion in order to keep her, she finally offers Rachel a promotion within her own department,[e 83] but is knocked down and killed by a cab before she can effect it.\n\n\n\n#### Doug[edit]\n\n\n**Douglas \"Doug\"** (Sam McMurray): Chandler's new boss in \"The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion\".[e 86] Doug enjoys calling Chandler \"*Bing!*\" and slapping his male colleagues on the butt. Monica and Chandler play a game of tennis with Doug and his wife, who are left exhausted, irritated and bewildered by Monica's ridiculously overly-competitive attitude in \"The One with Chandler's Work Laugh\" (January 21, 1999; season 5, No. 12). In this episode, it is implied that he, his wife, and the rest of Chandler's co-workers all dislike Joey, whom Chandler claims damaged his reputation in their eyes (presumably with all his stupidity) after he invited him to a work office party, damage repaired by Monica when he invited her to a different one. In \"The One with Ross's Step Forward\" (airdate December 13; 2001; season 8, No. 11), he invites Monica and Chandler to dinner to celebrate his divorce. To get out of it, Chandler pretends that he wants to be on his own because he and Monica have split up but it backfires when Doug, who despite his seemingly cheerful and relieved attitude towards his divorce is in reality clearly depressed over it, tries to cheer Chandler up by taking him to strip clubs, drunkenly throwing cans at birds and throwing (Doug's) wedding ring into the gutter (Chandler had refused Doug's offer at first, but then made the mistake of thoughtlessly stating his reason for this as being that Monica would not appreciate it, only to then be forced to correct himself upon seeing Doug's confused expression). It is also revealed in this episode that he urinated on an ice sculpture during Monica and Chandler's engagement party, and this is why he was not invited to the wedding.\n\n\n\n#### Bonnie[edit]\n\n\n**Bonnie** (Christine Taylor): Phoebe's formerly bald friend, first mentioned in the episode \"The One with the Candy Hearts\" (although referred to as 'Abby' then), whom she sets up with Ross in \"The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion\". Rachel met Bonnie two years prior to the events of this episode, and remembers her as a \"weird bald chick\"; however, when Rachel meets her she is horrified to see that her hair has actually grown back and she is actually a very attractive woman. Since Rachel still has feelings for Ross, she, in a successful attempt to sabotage his relationship with Bonnie, convinces her to shave her hair off again in \"The One at the Beach\" (airdate May 15, 1997; season 3, No. 25). She makes a brief appearance at the beginning of \"The One with the Jellyfish\", when Ross decides to dump her and get back together with Rachel. He implies that he made a dreadful mess of breaking up with her, both upsetting and enraging her in the process.\n\n\n\n#### Phoebe Abbott[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Teri Garr played Phoebe's birth mother, Phoebe Abbott, in three episodes of seasons 3 and 4.\n**Phoebe Abbott** (Teri Garr): Phoebe's birth mother. Phoebe tracks her down in \"The One at the Beach\", believing her to be a friend of Lily's. She reveals her parentage at the end of the episode and makes amends with Phoebe in \"The One with the Jellyfish\". Later, when Phoebe wants to be a surrogate mother for Frank and Alice's child,[e 1] she lends Phoebe her puppy to demonstrate how difficult it is to give up children after carrying them.\n\n\n\n#### The Chick and the Duck[edit]\n\n\n\n**The Chick** and **the Duck** (live animal actors): Chandler and Joey's pet birds. In \"The One with a Chick and a Duck\", Joey adopts a chick from an animal sanctuary, misunderstanding a news report about people who buy chicks and then find they cannot properly care for them. Encouraged by Phoebe to return the chick, but discovering that the animals would be euthanized, Chandler, who went to give the chick back, returns home with the chick and a duck. Chandler and Joey treat the chick and the duck as their own children—at one point, Chandler punishes the duck by sending him out to the hall (\"You stay out here and think about what you did!\").\n\n\nChandler briefly names the chick \"Yasmine\", after *Baywatch* actress Yasmine Bleeth (the chick later, however, turns out to be a rooster, not a hen); and in \"The One with Ross's Thing\", Chandler refers to the possible offspring of the duck and the chick as \"Dick\", while Joey refers to it as \"Chuck\". By season 6 the animals disappeared; the duck was mentioned but not seen in season 7. In the final episode of the series,[e 4] Joey bought Chandler a new duckling and chick as a housewarming gift—which Joey names \"Duck Jr.\" and \"Chick Jr.\"—and it is revealed that the original birds died a while ago, and Chandler, not wanting Joey to be upset about it, told him that they had gone to live on a farm, where visitors were not allowed.\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 4[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 4)\n\n#### Stu[edit]\n\n\nStuart \"Stu\" (Fred Stoller): a waiter at the restaurant Allesandro's, where Monica gets a job in \"The One Where They're Going to Party!\" In \"The One with the Girl from Poughkeepsie\" (airdate December 18, 1997; season 4, No. 10), Stu leads a kitchen staff rebellion against Monica (his motivation being partly that she had written an extremely critical review of the restaurant's food and service in the paper prior to being hired to work there herself, which he and the rest of the staff had felt publicly humiliated by and partly that a member of his family lost his job after she replaced him as the head chef), locking her in a cold storage room and writing insults on her chef's hat. Monica hires Joey as a stooge so she can show her authority in front of the staff by firing him in front of them all, and the rebellion soon ends. In \"The One with the Stripper\",[e 78] Stu gives Monica the phone number of someone she assumes is a stripper for Chandler's belated bachelor party, though she turns out to be a prostitute.\n\n\n\n#### Emily Waltham[edit]\n\n\nEmily Waltham (Helen Baxendale): The English niece of Rachel's boss Mr. Waltham, who arrives for a two-week visit to New York in \"The One with Joey's Dirty Day\". She has a whirlwind romance with Ross and they decide to get married. Her friendly relationship with Rachel soon changes during the wedding. The friends fly to London for their wedding in \"The One with Ross's Wedding\" (airdate May 7, 1998; season 4, No. 23 & 24), and Ross accidentally says Rachel's name at the altar, humiliating Emily in front of her friends and family. She aims to reconcile with him at the airport in \"The One After Ross Says Rachel\" (airdate September 24, 1998; season 5, No. 1) but sees Rachel with him about to go on their honeymoon and storms out again. Ross tries to convince her to move to New York.[e 87] She agrees but makes him promise to get rid of everything Rachel has ever come into physical contact with, in the friends' apartments, which would be virtually impossible, and she demands that he never see Rachel again. When she learns that he's having dinner with the old gang—including Rachel—she tells him she cannot trust him and she decides to end the marriage. She makes a final voice cameo in \"The One with the Ride Along\",[e 88] when she leaves a message on Ross's answering machine the night before her new wedding, telling him she is having second thoughts about it and is worried that they made a mistake splitting up. Rachel accidentally deletes the message, but tells Ross about it and convinces him not to respond to it. Emily's surname is that of the city where both creators of the show attended college.\n\n\nPatsy Kensit was originally approached to play the role but turned it down.[39] Emily and Ross's marriage was intended to last much longer in the series, but Helen Baxendale became pregnant prior to season 5 and was unable to travel for the show; hence, her limited appearances after season 4.[40] Helen Baxendale was asked to reprise the role in season 10, but turned it down to star in the West End play *After Miss Julie*, and because she did not want the same level of tabloid attention she received in 1998.[41]\n\n\n\n#### Stephen and Andrea Waltham[edit]\n\n\n\nStephen (Tom Conti) and Andrea Waltham (Jennifer Saunders): Emily's father and shrewish stepmother, introduced in \"The One with Ross's Wedding, Part 2\". Their marriage is icy and they openly treat one another with disdain. They are equally hostile towards Jack and Judy Geller when the Gellers refuse to pay for their house to be remodelled after the wedding reception. When the wedding takes place, like all of the guests they are shocked and utterly dumbfounded when Ross accidentally says Rachel's name instead of Emily's during the vows. In \"The One After Ross Says 'Rachel'\", Stephen angrily tells Ross that consequently Emily has gone into hiding after escaping out of the bathroom window and now feels humiliated, but this does not stop Andrea from telling Ross in front of him that she thinks he (Ross) is \"delicious\". Andrea's final words onscreen are, to Ross, \"Call me.\" Stephen's final words onscreen, to Andrea in response to her flirting with Ross, are \"You spend half your life in the bathroom-why don't you ever go out the bloody window?!\"\n\n\nJennifer Saunders co-star in *Absolutely Fabulous*, June Whitfield, makes a cameo appearance as the Waltham's housekeeper in \"The One with Ross's Wedding\".\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 5[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 5)\n\n#### Mr. Zelner[edit]\n\n\nMr. Zelner (Steve Ireland): an executive at Polo Ralph Lauren, who interviews Rachel while at the same time finding her quirks hard to deal with in \"The One with Rachel's Inadvertent Kiss\".[e 89] After Rachel is promoted in season 7, he becomes a recurring character. In \"The One with Princess Consuela\", he fires Rachel after overhearing her interview with a Gucci representative.[e 82] Ross tries to get Rachel her job back by bribing Zelner: Zelner has a son called Ross who likes dinosaurs. Ross says his name is \"Ron\", shocked to hear that Zelner's son is also named Ross.[e 32]\n\n\n\n#### Kim[edit]\n\n\nKim (Joanna Gleason): a colleague of Rachel's at Polo Ralph Lauren. In \"The One Where Rachel Smokes\", Rachel thinks she is missing out on important decisions, as they are always made when Kim takes a smoking break. She tries to take up smoking so she can stay in the loop but is unsuccessful when Kim, initially bewildered by Rachel's wacky behavior throughout her attempts to join her while she is smoking, threatens to fire her if she keeps damaging her health.[e 90] Later, Kim thinks Rachel kissed Ralph Lauren in order to take her job, when it was really Phoebe who kissed \"Kenny the copy guy\". After unsuccessfully trying to deny the affair, Rachel pretends Ralph dumped her. Kim believes her when she sees what she thinks is a cold look from Ralph (appearing as himself) in the elevator.[e 91]\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 6[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 6)\n\n*Note*: All characters who were introduced in this season did not re-appear in further seasons. Consequently, they are listed in the section on this page \"Only in season 6\".\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 7[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 7)\n\n#### Tag Jones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eddie Cahill recurred as Tag Jones in six episodes of season 7 and one episode of season 8.\nTag Jones (Eddie Cahill): Rachel's inexperienced but attractive new assistant at Polo Ralph Lauren. She hires him after being promoted, not because he is the best choice for the job but because she is smitten with him.[e 92] After he also becomes interested in her they try to keep their relationship a secret from her boss Zelner; otherwise Tag's employment would be a conflict of interest.[e 93] In \"The One Where They All Turn Thirty\" Rachel breaks up with Tag when she realizes that their six-year age difference makes him too young and immature for her to be dating if she intends to follow her marriage schedule.[e 52] He reappears in \"The One with the Red Sweater\" in season eight when Phoebe thinks he is the father of Rachel's unborn baby. He tells Rachel that he has matured a lot since their break-up and wants to resume their relationship, but backs off when he finds out she is pregnant by someone else. He later meets up with Ross—who is the real father and is wearing the same kind of red sweater.[e 94]\n\n\n\n#### Charles Bing/Helena Handbasket[edit]\n\n\nCharles Bing/Helena Handbasket (Kathleen Turner): Chandler's gay dad and Nora's ex-wife, regularly referred to as an unseen character in previous seasons. Determined to invite her to their wedding in \"The One with Chandler's Dad\", Monica drags Chandler to Charles' burlesque show in Las Vegas, where she is seen for the first time, performing under the name \"Helena Handbasket\". Chandler invites her to the wedding,[e 95] and she and Nora walk Chandler down the aisle in \"The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding, Part 1\".[e 96] She does not appear at the reception in \"The One After 'I Do'\",[e 48] though a deleted scene reveals she is upstairs crying after Joey accidentally ruined her dress.\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 8[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 8)\n\n#### Emma[edit]\n\n\n\nEmma Geller-Green (Cali Sheldon & Noelle Sheldon): Rachel and Ross' infant daughter. Though Ross had originally wanted to name his daughter \"Isabella\", Rachel wound up in tears when she decided that the name did not suit the baby and was dismayed by her other remaining choice, Delilah. Monica graciously suggests \"Emma\", the name she had chosen for her own future daughter when she was fourteen, but concedes that since \"*Nothing* goes with 'Bing', so I'm screwed,\" Rachel can give the name to her own daughter.\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 9[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 9)\n\n#### Mike Hannigan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Paul Rudd played the recurring character Mike Hannigan, boyfriend and later husband of Phoebe, throughout seasons 9 and 10.\nMichael \"Mike\" Hannigan (Paul Rudd): Phoebe's boyfriend and later husband: in \"The One with the Pediatrician\" (airdate October 10, 2002; season 9, No. 3), Joey and Phoebe decide to go on a double date, promising to fix each other up with blind dates. However, Joey forgets about Phoebe's date, and wanting to prevent her from discovering this when she enquires about the name of the man he has fixed her up with, he pretends that someone called \"Mike\" will be her date. He then enters the coffee shop and desperately yells \"Mike!\" Mike Hannigan replies and is roped into the date, which does not go well as Mike accidentally makes it clear that he does not actually know Joey personally, and Joey tries to recover the situation, consequently upsetting Phoebe and turning off his own blind date Mary-Ellen in the process. Mike feels sorry for Phoebe as he watches her leave and when he spots her again in the coffee shop the next day, he speaks to her and explains that he allowed himself to be roped into the date \"because I was told that I'd get a free dinner-which I didn't-and that I'd meet a pretty girl-which I did.\" A flattered Phoebe does not turn him down when he asks her out on a second date,[e 97] which is equally bad thanks to Ross, who accidentally upsets Phoebe before it can begin, causing her to spend rather a lot of the night crying on Mike's shoulder. Ross goes to Mike's house and tries to explain to him that he had accidentally upset Phoebe, which sets off a chain of ridiculous events that result in Mike ultimately deciding he has feelings for Phoebe, and eventually, they decide to move in together;[e 98] Phoebe suggests that one day they could get married but he tells her that, after his messy divorce, he never wants to get married again, which results in them breaking up. Emotionally unable to be apart from each other, they reconcile in \"The One with the Memorial Service\" (airdate March 13, 2003; season 9, No. 17). In \"The One in Barbados, Part 1\", Monica summons Mike to Barbados, where he proposes to Phoebe at the same time as David. She turns both men down but admits that Mike is the man she wants to be with. Subsequently, Mike has to break up with Precious (Anne Dudek), the girl he has been seeing since breaking up with Phoebe, but Phoebe (who annoys Precious by calling her \"Susie\") convinces Precious to dump *him* instead.[e 99] In \"The One Where Rachel's Sister Babysits\" (airdate October 30, 2003; season 10, No. 5), he proposes to her, and they are married soon after by Joey.[e 100] When Phoebe briefly changes her name to \"Princess Consuela Bananahammock\",[e 82] he suggests changing his name to \"Crap Bag\" making her change it back. He makes a brief appearance in \"The Last One\", bringing over a \"Welcome to the World, Baby Bing\" banner to Monica and Chandler's and tells Phoebe that he also wants to have a baby, to which Phoebe agrees.\n\n\n\n#### Theodore and Bitsy Hannigan[edit]\n\n\n\nTheodore and Bitsy Hannigan (Gregory Itzin and Cristine Rose): Mike's rich, haughty parents. He introduces Phoebe to them,[e 70] and soon after they make it clear that they do not approve of Phoebe due to being both irritated and bewildered by her odd quirks, but Mike defies them and declares his love for her in front of his parents and their two \"sinfully boring\" friends (who are likewise bemused by the odd quirks of Phoebe). They later meet Joey, who confuses and bemuses them with his comments about how nice it is that \"their little ones are growing up\" (Phoebe had told him he was \"like a dad\" to her) and later attend the wedding in \"The One with Phoebe's Wedding\". His father “crushes a pill” into his wife's drink at the wedding so that she does not create a scene and she appears happy and carefree.\n\n\n\n#### Amy Green[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Christina Applegate played Amy Green.\nAmy Green (Christina Applegate): one of Rachel's two sisters, who first appears in \"The One with Rachel's Other Sister\" (airdate November 21, 2002; season 9, No. 8). She arrives at Monica and Chandler's for Thanksgiving dinner, where she is annoyed that she would not get custody of Emma if Rachel and Ross died. A boorish, hedonistic, brazen, dimwitted, amoral, materialistic and utterly unlikeable bully who could not care less about other people's feelings, she greatly irritates the friends with her cruelly honest opinions of them and selfish, self-absorbed attitude; though seems a little afraid of Monica, convinced that she is crazy (after witnessing Monica's bizarre rules when it comes to eating off the china plates she and Chandler received as a wedding present). When Rachel and Amy later have a fight after the former feels the latter has insulted Emma, which results in them accidentally breaking one of Monica's plates (causing her to nearly pass out), Chandler firmly tells both of them off as a father would do, and demands that Amy apologise for ruining Thanksgiving, for which she does. He then later hints to her that their fight was \"a major turn-on\". Rachel also makes up with Amy after offering to let her use her Ralph Lauren employee discount.\n\n\nAmy appears again in \"The One Where Rachel's Sister Babysits\", where she tells Rachel that she plans to marry her ex-boyfriend's father, who is rich. However, upon Rachel's advice to try to make it on her own, Amy calls off her engagement and sleeps over at Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel tries to teach her responsibility by letting her babysit Emma (who Amy calls 'Ella', insisting it is prettier), and tries to convince her to stop being so selfish and do something nice for another person. Eventually, Amy decides to take Rachel's advice and do something nice for Emma. Only trouble is, the utterly self-absorbed and self-centered Amy decides to get Emma's ears pierced. Ross and Rachel are horrified and angry at Amy, especially as she reveals she plans on becoming a baby stylist. However, Amy and Rachel make up at the end of the episode when they gossip about their sister Jill gaining a ton of weight. This was an oblique reference to Reese Witherspoon (who played Jill) being pregnant.\n\n\nAlthough Amy, like her father Leonard, was a deliberately unpleasant and unlikeable character, the comic relief she provided caused her to, again like her father Leonard, become memorable as a character that fans \"loved to hate\". In 2003, Applegate won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her appearance in \"The One with Rachel's Other Sister\" and was nominated again for her appearance in \"The One Where Rachel's Sister Babysits\".\n\n\n\n#### Charlie Wheeler[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Comedian Aisha Tyler played Joey's, then Ross', paleontologist girlfriend in seasons 9 and 10.\nCharlie Wheeler (Aisha Tyler): an attractive paleontology professor (goes to Woodroffe school) whom Ross falls for in \"The One with the Soap Opera Party\" (airdate April 24, 2003; season 9, No. 20). He plans to ask her out, but is too late when she gets together with Joey instead. Initially angry, he eventually accepts Joey and Charlie's relationship and helps Joey come up with intelligent places to take her on dates in \"The One with the Fertility Test\". At Ross's conference in \"The One in Barbados\", Charlie tells Joey that they have nothing in common and breaks up with him. She and Ross then get together. In \"The One with Ross's Grant\" (airdate November 6, 2003; season 10, No. 6), she breaks up with Ross and gets back together with her old flame, Dr. Benjamin Hobart (Greg Kinnear).\n\n\nThe character of Charlie was created in part to counter criticism the *Friends* production staff had received for featuring too few characters played by ethnic minority actors. Aisha Tyler was only the second major supporting character to be portrayed by a black actress, following Gabrielle Union's appearance as Kristen Lang in \"The One with the Cheap Wedding Dress\" (airdate March 15, 2001; season 7, No. 17).[42] The role was not specifically written for a black actor. Tyler told the *St Petersburg Times*, \"I hope [people's] frustration over [the lack of diversity] is tempered by the fact that when they wrote this role, they didn't wimp out. They wrote her so smart and sexy and elevated, she wasn't just the black girl on *Friends*.\"[43]\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 10[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 10)\n\n![](image)Anna Faris played Erica, a young expectant woman who lets Monica and Chandler adopt her twins in season 10.\n#### Erica[edit]\n\n\nErica (Anna Faris): a young girl from Cincinnati who decides to let Monica and Chandler adopt her baby in \"The One with the Birth Mother\" (airdate January 8, 2004; season 10, No. 9). She visits New York in \"The One Where Joey Speaks French\" and sees the tourist sites with Monica and Chandler. She goes into labor at the end of \"The One with Rachel's Going Away Party\" and gives birth to twins Erica and Jack in \"The Last One\".\n\n\n\n#### Jack and Erica Bing[edit]\n\n\n\nJack and Erica Bing—the adopted son and daughter of Monica and Chandler, born in \"The Last One\". They were portrayed by Cristobal and Antonella. It is revealed that Monica and Chandler did not know they would be having twins until they were born. Chandler suggests giving one of them up but Monica refuses, saying, \"We cannot split them up. They're our children and they're coming with us.\"[e 4]\n\n\n\n#### Missy Goldberg[edit]\n\n\nMissy Goldberg (Ellen Pompeo): a woman from Ross' and Chandler's college, at which they both made a pact to not ask her out so it would not damage their friendship, introduced in \"The One Where the Stripper Cries\" (airdate February 5, 2004; season 10, No. 11). At a reunion, Chandler gives Ross permission to break the pact, now that he is married, where it is revealed that Chandler and Missy made out numerous times during college after school hours in the school's science labs, which Ross calls his \"turf\".\n\n\n\n#### Benjamin Hobart[edit]\n\n\nBenjamin Hobart (Greg Kinnear): Nobel Prize–winning paleontologist and ex-boyfriend of Ross' girlfriend Charlie Wheeler, introduced in \"The One with Ross's Grant\". After seeing Charlie again for the first time in an apparently long while and meeting Ross for the first time (who bemuses him with ridiculous comments) he eventually confesses to Ross he is still in love with her and then unsuccessfully tries to persuade Ross to break up with her. When Ross refuses, Benjamin comes to resent him and displays this resentment by asking utterly ridiculous questions at the grant interview. He and Charlie eventually get back together, after Ross makes him confess his actions in front of her.\n\n\n\n#### Amanda Buffamonteezi[edit]\n\n\nAmanda Buffamonteezi (Jennifer Coolidge): an annoying lady who used to live in the building before moving to England.[e 101] She picks up a fake English accent and claims to have slept with Evel Knievel. Her inflated ego and utterly self-absorbed attitude cause Monica and Phoebe to find her insufferable, but since they do not want to hurt the nonetheless good-natured Amanda's feelings, they agree to meet up with her in the coffee shop after Chandler ruins their original plan not to take any of her phone calls by doing exactly that and informing her that they are in the house with him, and then bemuses her by informing her that he takes pedicures before handing the phone to Monica.\n\n\nJennifer Coolidge also appears in the spin-off series Joey playing his agent.\n\n\n\n#### Roy[edit]\n\n\nRoy (Danny DeVito): a stripper in \"The One Where the Stripper Cries\", who is hired for Phoebe's bachelorette party at the last minute after she expresses disappointment that the party is not \"dirtier\". Put under pressure to quickly hire a stripper by Phoebe (who had forgotten to ask them to hire one prior to when the party actually began) they look through the phone book and call the first stripper whose number they discover, asking him to quickly arrive at Monica's apartment where the party is taking place. When he turns up, the girls are surprised to see that he is at least 50 years old, but also delusional about his physical appearance, as he clearly has trouble accepting the fact that he has not aged gracefully and is not physically appealing to women anymore. When he sees that Phoebe is not enjoying his performance he gets annoyed, particularly when she claims while cringing that \"this is how (she) looks when (she's) turned on.\" They have an argument over whether or not he should be paid for arriving after a rather difficult and rushed journey to the apartment on his part, and when she refuses to allow a sympathetic Rachel and Monica to pay him and also insults him, the sensitive stripper gets upset and cries as he is forced to accept the fact that he is no longer physically attractive, but stripping is all he knows. In her guilt, Phoebe comforts him and tells him that he should teach stripping instead. At her insistence, he then performs one last time for the party.\n\n\n\n#### Mackenzie[edit]\n\n\nMackenzie (Dakota Fanning): the daughter of the current residents of the house Monica and Chandler buy. She winds up helping Joey deal with his anxieties about Chandler and Monica moving out of the city. As a bit of revenge for Joey's overanxious behavior, Monica and Chandler briefly pretend that Mackenzie is a ghost.[e 32]\n\n\n\n## Characters appearing in only one season[edit]\n\n\nEach of the following characters of *Friends*, portrayed by a celebrity, may or may not be particularly significant to the story\n\n\n\n### Only in season 1[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 1)\n\n![](image)George Clooney (*pictured*) and Noah Wyle portray Drs. Michael Mitchell and Jeffrey Rosen, respectively. In *ER*, they portray, Drs. Doug Ross and John Carter, respectively\n#### Joseph Tribbiani Sr. and Gloria Tribbiani[edit]\n\n\n\nIn \"The One with the Boobies\" (airdate January 19, 1995; season 1, No. 13), Joey finds out that his father, Joey Sr. (Robert Costanzo), is having an affair with another woman, Ronni (Lee Garlington). Joey (the son) tries to set things right, but Gloria (Brenda Vaccaro), Joey's mother, who secretly knew about the affair all along, makes Joey change it back because her husband's been unusually nice to her since he started cheating on her.\n\n\nThough Joey's parents do not appear on the show again, Joey Sr. later makes an appearance on the spin-off series *Joey*, making Costanzo the only actor, besides Matt LeBlanc, to reprise his role from *Friends* on the series.\n\n\n\n#### Drs. Michael Mitchell and Jeffrey Rosen[edit]\n\n\n\nDrs. Michael Mitchell (George Clooney) and Jeffrey Rosen (Noah Wyle): Two doctors whom Rachel and Monica meet at a hospital and go on a date with. Monica and Rachel pretend to be each other for health insurance purposes—eventually causing things to go wild. Dr. Mitchell later saves the life of Ross's monkey, Marcel, who swallows alphabet tiles from a *Scrabble* game and nearly chokes to death.[e 33] (Clooney and Wyle were also cast as physicians on the NBC medical drama *ER* when they appeared together on *Friends*.)\n\n\n\n#### Jill Goodacre Connick[edit]\n\n\n\nJill Goodacre Connick (herself) gets trapped with Chandler in an ATM vestibule in \"The One with the Blackout\".[e 34] Chandler uses her cell phone to tell Joey and the others, engages in awkward conversion with her, and plays a \"spin the phone pen over your head\" game with her.\n\n\n\n#### Alan[edit]\n\n\nAlan (Geoffrey Lower) is Monica's boyfriend in \"The One with the Thumb\".[e 102] Everyone likes him more than Monica does. At the end of the episode Monica breaks up with him, and has the break-up talk with the other friends as if they broke up with him, too. The irony is that Alan is relieved when Monica breaks up with him as [he] 'just can't stand your friends'.\n\n\n\n#### Lydia[edit]\n\n\nLydia (Leah Remini): a single mother-to-be whose childbirth Joey assists before Carol gives birth to Ben.[e 15] Their conversations mostly revolve around whose favored basketball team is better, the Boston Celtics (Lydia) or New York Knicks (Joey). In the end, the father of Lydia's baby arrives, and Joey leaves them alone. Remini had originally auditioned for the role of Monica.\n\n\n\n#### Roger[edit]\n\n\nRoger (Fisher Stevens): a psychiatrist who Phoebe dates in \"The One with the Boobies\". The other friends take a swift dislike to him after he (very accurately) diagnoses their unconscious needs and foibles—such as Chandler's intimacy issues and Ross' guilt over being favored over Monica by their parents—and their narcissistic group dynamic. Phoebe breaks up with him, having joined the others in hating him; he is never seen again, but is mentioned in the following episode (\"The One with the Candy Hearts\") when Phoebe calls him because \"it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day\"—essentially confirming what he said about her neediness and clinginess.\n\n\n\n### Only in season 2[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 2)\n\n![](image)\nChris Isaak portrays Phoebe's date, Rob Donnan, who bans her from the library for singing songs that, as parents claim, offensively influence children.\n![](image)\nJulia Roberts portrays Susie Moss, who plots revenge on Chandler for lifting her skirt to reveal her underwear in her childhood by taking away his clothes and leaving him her underwear in the public place.\n![](image)\nBrooke Shields portrays Erika Ford, who stalks Joey and believes that Joey is Dr. Drake Ramoray, his role.\n\n\n---\nThree above pictured actors appear in \"The One After the Superbowl\" (1996).\n\n#### Caroline Duffy[edit]\n\n\nCaroline Duffy (Lea Thompson): a cartoonist. Reprising her role from *Caroline in the City*, she talks with Joey and Chandler—seeing them with Ben and consequently thinking them to be lovers—in \"The One with the Baby on the Bus\".[e 38]\n\n\n\n#### Eddie Manoick[edit]\n\n\nEddie Manoick (Adam Goldberg): Chandler's roommate after Joey moves into his own apartment, having landed the recurring role Dr. Drake Ramoray on *Days of Our Lives*.[e 66] Chandler quickly realizes they have nothing in common: Eddie hates *Baywatch*, foosball, and sports in general. When they seem to be successfully bonding, Eddie reveals his disturbed inner thoughts, and begins to show signs of mental illness, such as stealing mannequin heads from Macy's and obsessively dehydrating fruit. In \"The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies\",[e 103] he suspects Chandler of both having sex with his ex-girlfriend Tilly and killing his goldfish. He later forgets these events, but Chandler demands he move out after learning that Eddie watches him sleep.[e 5] Eddie agrees to leave but later denies the conversation took place, instead believing that he and Chandler took a weekend road trip to Las Vegas. Chandler ultimately gets rid of Eddie by allowing Joey to move back in after Joey's career falters following the death of Dr. Ramoray. They change the locks, move Eddie's stuff out into the hall, and pretend that Eddie never lived there; confused, Eddie leaves and is never seen again.\n\n\nAdam Goldberg later appeared in the second season of *Joey* as **Jimmy Costa**, the biological father of Joey's nephew, Michael.\n\n\n\n#### Rob Donnan[edit]\n\n\nRob Donnan (Chris Isaak): Rob asks Phoebe to sing for the children at a library, but the parents are horrified by her morbidly honest lyrics. However, the kids like the songs and come to the café to listen to her, and Phoebe teaches Rob \"Smelly Cat\".[e 20] Isaak's song \"Wicked Game\" plays in the background when Rachel and Ross sleep together for the first time (\"The One Where Ross and Rachel...You Know\").\n\n\n\n#### Zoo staff[edit]\n\n\n\nThe Zoo Administrator (Fred Willard) of the zoo Ross sent Marcel to, who tries to cover up a break-in in which Marcel is kidnapped and forced into show business. When Ross visits the zoo to visit Marcel, the administrator lies and tells Ross that Marcel has died. Ross later learns the truth about what happened from an unusual janitor (Dan Castellaneta), an unusual man with a strange fascination for the animals in the zoo.[e 20]\n\n\n\n#### Susie Moss[edit]\n\n\nSusie \"Underpants\" Moss (Julia Roberts): an old childhood friend of Chandler, who's working on the production of a movie,[e 20] and with whom Chandler has a colored history: when they were in elementary school, Chandler pulled up Susie's skirt when she was on stage, revealing her underwear to the entire school, and she never lived it down until she graduated high school. They arrange a date, Chandler unsuspecting that it is a plot to get revenge. After convincing him to wear her panties, Susie takes him out to dinner, undresses him in the men's room, and takes off with his clothes—leaving him in a bathroom stall wearing nothing but her panties. She is never seen again. Julia Roberts and Matthew Perry briefly dated in real life.\n\n\n\n#### Jean-Claude Van Damme[edit]\n\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme (himself):\nan actor in the movie Susie's producing, over whom Rachel and Monica compete for attention. Monica has a crush on him but is too shy to ask him out; so Rachel attempts to on her behalf, but he says he'd rather go out with her (Rachel). Rachel asks Monica for permission, which she unhappily gives. After Rachel goes on the date with him it causes a fight between her and Monica that ends with Rachel telling Monica that she will not see him anymore, so that Monica can go out with him. When Monica goes on her date with him, she finds out he only agreed to go out (with Monica) because Rachel told him that Monica was \"dying to have a threesome with him and Drew Barrymore\". Monica immediately dumps him. When she gets home she and Rachel fight again, but this time end up apologizing to each other, agreeing they should not have let him come between them. He is last seen being greatly irritated – along with everyone else on the studio set – by Joey's stupidity while trying to act alongside him.[e 20]\n\n\n\n#### Erika Ford[edit]\n\n\nErika Ford (Brooke Shields): a mentally ill stalker who thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Ramoray, the character he plays on *Days of Our Lives*.[e 20] Despite this, Joey goes on a date with her. She dumps him when she suspects \"Drake\" is cheating on her with another woman (actually another character in the soap opera). He tries to explain that \"It's a TV show!\" and \"I'm not *Drake!*\", but she does not understand, so Ross tells her Joey's \"Hans Ramoray\", Drake's \"evil twin\"—and Joey tells her to go to Salem to find the \"real\" Drake Ramoray. She is never seen again afterwards.\n\n\n\n#### Ryan[edit]\n\n\nRyan (Charlie Sheen) arrives in New York on leave from the Navy to see Phoebe, who has chicken pox at the time.[e 104] He is bewildered to see Phoebe covering her head with a scarf, trying to disguise the fact that she has chicken pox; eventually convincing her to admit this to him, he decides he cannot stand to be apart from her and consequently catches chicken pox from her and they both spend the rest of the time sick and trying to not scratch at the sores.\n\n\n\n#### Duncan Sullivan[edit]\n\n\nDuncan Sullivan (Steve Zahn) is a Canadian ice dancer that Phoebe married in order to allow him to get a Green card.[e 40] While Phoebe believed him to be homosexual, he returned to ask Phoebe for a divorce because he has realized he is straight and has proposed to another woman.

A slightly-taller doppelgänger of Ross, Russ is a dentist. While both Ross and Rachel are initially oblivious to Russ' resemblance to Ross, Rachel finally notices after the duo get into an argument over what defines a \"doctor\". In the final scene of the episode, \"The One with Russ\", Russ reveals to Phoebe and Chandler that Rachel had broken up with him. As Russ wonders what he will do with his life, Ross' own ex-girlfriend Julie enters and meets eyes with Russ, the two instantly falling in love, and leaving Central Perk together. In 2019, Lauren Tom described the couple as still being together by that year.[44]\n\n\n\n### Only in season 3[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 3)\n\n![](image)Jon Favreau played Monica's entrepreneur and ultimate fighting boyfriend Pete Becker in six episodes\n![](image)In \"The One with the Screamer\" (1997), Ben Stiller portrayed Tommy, Rachel's date, whom Ross finds insane for yelling at people whenever angered\n![](image)\n![](image)\nRobin Williams (*far above*) and Billy Crystal (*above*) portrayed uncredited roles of Tomas and Tim, respectively, in the opening of \"The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion\" (1997).\n\n#### Chloe[edit]\n\n\nChloe (Angela Featherstone): First mentioned (though only as \"the girl from the copy place\") in \"The One with the Princess Leia Fantasy\" and \"The One with the Jam\", and first seen in \"The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break\", when Chloe (almost effortlessly) seduces Ross after he and Rachel have a fight and he believes she (Rachel) is sleeping with Mark. Ross tries to get her out of his apartment quickly the next day (in \"The One with the Morning After\") after hearing a voice message from Rachel rescinding their \"break\", but Chloe is still there (albeit hidden) when Rachel arrives.

He asks her out for a pizza, and takes her to Rome. Monica worries about the fact that she is not attracted to him and cannot figure out why. When Pete offers her a job in his restaurant, she turns him down, not wanting to hurt his feelings, but a goodbye kiss from Pete finally awakens her feelings. Monica thinks he is going to propose in \"The One with Ross's Thing\"; instead, he tells her he wants to become an Ultimate Fighting Champion. He gets badly beaten by Tank Abbott,[e 86] and every other fighter he encounters, and Monica reluctantly ends their relationship after he refuses to quit despite his increasingly debilitating injuries.\n\n\nThe character of Pete was conceived as \"a Bill Gates billionaire genius scientist-type\" to whom Monica was not attracted. The producers and casting director had difficulty finding an actor to play Pete as they wanted, \"someone who was appealing enough that we liked him, so we could root for him, but on the other hand, wasn't so drop-dead male model gorgeous that we would go, 'What's your problem?' to Monica when she didn't fall for him.\"[45]\n\n\n\n#### Kate Miller[edit]\n\n\nKate Miller (Dina Meyer): Joey's co-star in the play *Boxing Day*.[e 81] Joey falls for her, and she sleeps with him, but she is already dating the director, Marshall Townend, and sees Joey as a one-night stand.

He later dumps Kate after she (and the play) gets bad reviews.\n\n\n\n#### Vince and Jason[edit]\n\n\nVince (Matt Battaglia) is a fire fighter and Jason (Robert Gant) is a kindergarten teacher. Phoebe dates both men for some time before they find out about each other, and both break up with Phoebe.\n\n\n\n#### Lauren[edit]\n\n\nLauren (Jennifer Milmore): Kate's understudy in *Boxing Day*.

Ross tries to warn Rachel and the other friends, but they do not believe him, assuming he's just jealous. However, Tommy's true colours are exposed when all six friends see him lose his temper after Joey and Chandler's pet baby chicken urinates in his hand and he screams at both it and their pet duck. Accepting, to his own chagrin, that the others are now afraid of him, he breaks up with Rachel and is never seen again.\n\n\n\n#### Isabella Rossellini[edit]\n\n\nIsabella Rossellini (herself): Rossellini visits Central Perk at the end of the episode \"The One with Frank Jr.\" One of the episode's plotlines involved Ross and Rachel compile lists, each of 5 people (celebrities) they can have sex with; Rossellini was originally on Ross' list, but he replaces her with Winona Ryder because Rossellini is \"international\", and thus will never be around...only to see Rossellini herself. Rachel encourages Ross to pursue her, knowing he'll get shot down; Rossellini is somewhat charmed and intrigued by Ross's \"list,\" but leaves after seeing that she is not on the final version (quipping that she has a list of five coffee house guys, but she has just bumped Ross off her list).\n\n\n\n#### Tomas and Tim[edit]\n\n\n\nTomas (Robin Williams) and Tim (Billy Crystal): two strangers at the coffee shop. Appearing at the beginning of \"The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion\", they perform a superfluous skit while sitting on the group's sofa at Central Perk.

Eventually Tim reveals how he's sleeping with Tomas' wife; bursting into tears, Tomas starts shouting at and insulting Tim, and leaves the shop in a loud fury, followed by Tim, who gives the six shocked, bewildered friends one last embarrassed, apologetic look before he leaves. Robin Williams and Billy Crystal were filming nearby and adlibbed all their lines, and were uncredited.\n\n\n\n\n### Only in season 4[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 4)\n\n![](image)Paget Brewster played Kathy, an actress who dates and cheats on first Joey, then Chandler in season 4\n![](image)Tate Donovan recurred as Rachel's boyfriend Joshua at the same time as he was dating Jennifer Aniston\n![](image)Michael Vartan portrayed Richard Burke's (Tom Selleck) son, Tim, in only one episode as Monica's date\n#### Kathy[edit]\n\n\nKathy (Paget Brewster): Joey's girlfriend, introduced in \"The One with Joey's New Girlfriend\" (airdate October 30, 1997; season 4, No. 5).

Although Chandler is initially uncomfortable about the possibility of their relationship becoming sexual as he would be directly compared to Joey, Monica and Rachel are able to give Chandler some pointers. Sometime later, Chandler goes to see Kathy in a play and becomes jealous of her steamy onstage sex scenes with her co-star, Nick. Chandler starts to suspect that she is cheating on him; when he confronts her about it, she leaves, offended, and Chandler assumes the worst.

When Rachel confronts Melissa about the kiss, she pretends to have no memory of it ever happening because she does not think Rachel will return her love. At the end of dinner, Rachel kisses her again to prove to Phoebe that she can do something crazy. Melissa takes this to mean that Rachel loves her back. She says that \"nobody can kiss that good and not mean it\", but Rachel says that she is just a good kisser. Melissa is extremely embarrassed and tries to act as if she was kidding, saying, \"I'm not in love with you. I don't hear coconuts banging together.

Appears in \"The One Where Rachel Goes Back to Work\", \"The One with the Mugging\" and \"The One with the Lottery\", when he offers Chandler the job of junior copywriter.\n\n\n\n#### Molly[edit]\n\n\nMolly (Melissa George): Emma's hot nanny, whom Ross gets to hire since Rachel does not see it in her.[e 133] When Joey sees her, his lady killer instinct kicks in. Ross tries to make Joey stay away from her when he flirts with her, which makes Joey want her more. Ross wants Chandler to watch Joey and make sure he does not go after Molly. When Ross is lecturing Joey there is a knock on the door and it is Molly's girlfriend. They kiss, and Ross no longer has a problem—although Joey's even more turned on by her lesbian status. Molly makes one more cameo appearance, in \"The One Where Monica Sings\" (airdate January 30, 2003; season 9, No. 13).\n\n\n\n#### Sandy[edit]\n\n\nSandy (Freddie Prinze Jr.): Emma's first nanny.[e 42] After unsuccessfully interviewing several female nannies, both Ross and Rachel are surprised to see that Sandy is male. During the interview he wins Rachel over and she hires him despite Ross not being keen. Sandy proves himself to be highly competent, advising Ross and Rachel that toy dinosaurs he found in the apartment were not age-appropriate for Emma (only for Ross to tell him that they were his [Ross'] toys, causing a bemused Sandy to reply \"Also not age-appropriate\") and even educating the idiotic Joey with his techniques; however, he is let go after Ross cannot get used to the idea of having a male nanny, but not before convincing the latter to break down in tears when reminiscing about his bad experience with his father.\n\n\n\n#### Zach[edit]\n\n\nZach (John Stamos), a prospective sperm donor for Monica, who finds out that Chandler cannot get her pregnant.[e 43]\n\n\n\n#### Wendy[edit]\n\n\nWendy (Selma Blair), a philandering co-worker of Chandler's in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who tries to seduce him when he's forced to spend Christmas there.[e 134]\n\n\n\n### Only in season 10[edit]\n\n\nMain section: § Introduced in season 10.

All six actors appear in every episode.\n\n\n\n#### Rachel Green[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rachel Green\n\n**Rachel Karen Green** (Jennifer Aniston) is the spoiled but warm-hearted and likable daughter of Dr. Leonard Green (Ron Leibman), a rich, Long Island vascular surgeon, and Sandra Green (Marlo Thomas). She has two sisters, Jill (Reese Witherspoon) and Amy (Christina Applegate). Rachel is introduced into the series in the first episode after she leaves her fiancé, Barry Farber, at the altar, and attempts to live independently without financial support from her parents.[e 3] She flees from her almost-wedding to New York City to find Monica Geller, her friend from high school. Rachel moves into Monica's apartment and meets Phoebe Buffay and Joey Tribbiani. Rachel already knows Ross Geller, Monica's brother, as all three attended Lincoln High School. In the first episode, she is also reacquainted with Chandler Bing, Ross's college buddy; however, later episodes retcon this, and she is shown to have met Chandler on Thanksgiving, whilst Ross was at college. Rachel's first job is as a waitress at Central Perk coffee house. She later begins to work in fashion, becoming an assistant buyer, and later a personal shopper, at Bloomingdale's. She eventually becomes a buyer at Polo Ralph Lauren.\n\n\nA great deal of Rachel's life throughout the series revolves around her relationship with Ross Geller. At the end of season seven, during Monica's and Chandler's wedding, it is revealed that Rachel is pregnant from a one-night stand with Ross. Initially, Rachel is determined to raise the baby on her own, but later she realizes she needs Ross's help. She decides to move in with Ross, even though the two are not involved in an intimate relationship. Their daughter is born during the eighth-season finale. Her aunt Monica, 'gives' an indecisive Rachel the name Emma, which she had chosen for her own daughter, at age 14.\n\n\nDuring the tenth season, Rachel is offered a job with Louis Vuitton in Paris. She accepts and prepares to move herself and Emma to France. However, in the series finale, she declines the job offer and famously \"gets off the plane\". Rachel and Ross get back together in the final episode of the series.[e 4]\n\n\n\n#### Monica Geller[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Monica Geller\n\n**Monica E. Geller** (Courteney Cox) is the younger sister of Ross and best friend of Rachel, the latter of whom she allows to live with her after Rachel forsakes her own wedding. She works primarily as a chef at a variety of restaurants. She is described as the mother hen of the group,[18] and is known for her obsessive-compulsive and competitive nature.[19][20] Monica is often jokingly teased by the others, especially Ross, for having been overweight as a teen.\n\n\nIn the second season, Monica falls for her father Jack's (Elliott Gould) friend, Richard Burke (Tom Selleck). Despite the twenty-one year age difference, Monica and Richard are happy, and her parents accept their relationship. However, as a result of Monica yearning for a family but Richard having already had one, they break up at the end of the second season. Monica then pursues a chain of various men until she unexpectedly begins a relationship with her longtime friend, Chandler Bing, at the end of the fourth season, during her brother Ross' wedding to Emily Waltham in London. Monica and Chandler try to hide their relationship from the rest of the group for much of the fifth season, but eventually everyone finds out. After celebrating their first anniversary in Las Vegas, they move in together and get engaged by the sixth-season finale. After their marriage, Monica and Chandler try to conceive children, only to discover that they are unable to do so. In the final season of the series, they adopt new-born twins, whom they name Erica and Jack.\n\n\n\n#### Phoebe Buffay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Phoebe Buffay\n\n**Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan** (Lisa Kudrow) is an odd, ditzy albeit sweet-natured masseuse who grew up homeless, sometimes telling her friends outlandish tales of life on the street. She is an aspiring musician who plays the guitar and sings songs with somewhat unusual lyrics at the coffee shop. She has an identical twin sister, Ursula Pamela Buffay (also played by Kudrow), who is just as odd as Phoebe and appeared as a recurring character on *Mad About You*. After a series of dates and relationships with a number of men, Phoebe meets Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd) in season nine, whom she eventually marries in season ten. She also became a surrogate mother for her half-brother Frank Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi), giving birth to his triplets in the fifth season.\n\n\n\n#### Joey Tribbiani[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Joey Tribbiani\n\n**Joseph Francis \"Joey\" Tribbiani Jr.** (Matt LeBlanc) is a good-natured but not-so-bright struggling actor and food lover, who becomes mildly famous for his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on a fictionalized version of *Days of Our Lives*. Joey is a womanizer, with many girlfriends throughout the series, often using his catchphrase pick-up line \"How *you* doin'?\" He develops a crush on Rachel in season eight.\n\n\nPrior to his role on *Friends*, LeBlanc appeared as a regular on the short-lived *TV 101*, a minor character in the sitcom *Married... with Children*, and as a main character in its spin-offs, *Top of the Heap* and *Vinnie & Bobby*.[21] After *Friends* ended, LeBlanc portrayed Joey in a short-lived spin-off, *Joey*.\n\n\n\n#### Chandler Bing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chandler Bing\n\n**Chandler Muriel Bing** (Matthew Perry) is an executive in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large multi-national corporation. He later quits his job and becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency.\n\n\nChandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor.[22] He often teases his best friend Joey for the latter's stupidity. Chandler is often depicted as being somewhat of a hapless individual, suffering a lot of bad luck while struggling through life and occasionally struggling with an on-and-off smoking addiction. However, he eventually falls in deep mutual love with Monica and proposes to her at the close of season six, with the two of them marrying at the close of season seven. At the end of series, he and Monica adopt twins, whom they name Jack and Erica.[17]\n\n\nLike Aniston and LeBlanc, Perry had already appeared in several unsuccessful sitcom pilots before being cast. He had also starred in the TV series *Second Chance* and *Sydney*.\n\n\n\n#### Ross Geller[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ross Geller\n\n**Ross Geller** (David Schwimmer) is a paleontologist at a museum of prehistory, and later a professor of paleontology at New York University. Considered by some to be the most intelligent of the six main characters, but at the same time a clumsyquirky man, Ross is known for being a smart, know-it-all who prides himself on his rationality, despite his clear hopeless romanticism. He is shown to be the most caring of all six members in various instances on the show, but also shown to be the most neurotic and his insecurities often get him into trouble.\n\n\nRoss is Monica's older brother, Chandler's college roommate, and Rachel's on-again, off-again boyfriend. His first marriage has already failed by the time the show begins, with his second lasting mere weeks. The second divorce seemed to greatly depress him and make him quick-tempered near the start of season five, such as when he screams at his colleague for taking his sandwich and throwing it away. After he gets Ugly Naked Guy's apartment, he is offered to return to work, but he loses his temper again when he sees Chandler and Monica having sex through his window, becoming the last one to find out about their relationship. He also drunkenly married Rachel in Las Vegas, after which they unsuccessfully tried to annul it and had to settle for a divorce, which became Ross' third one. Ross's relationship with Rachel is a major storyline throughout the series. He is also the father of his ex-wife Carol's son, Ben, and Rachel's daughter, Emma. In the series finale, Ross and Rachel finally reconcile, deciding to be together once and for all.\n\n\nThe character of Ross was developed with David Schwimmer in the minds of writers and Schwimmer was also the first actor to be cast on the show.\n\n\nBefore being cast in *Friends*, Schwimmer played minor characters in *The Wonder Years* and *NYPD Blue*;[23] his first regular series role was in the sitcom *Monty*. Schwimmer is the only cast member native to New York City.\n\n\nRoss Geller was also voted as the best character on *Friends* in a poll conducted by Comedy Central UK.[24]\n\n\n\n### *Joey*[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Temperamental, promiscuous and not particularly bright but very street-wise, Gina is a caring but over-protective and domineering mother. For years she convinced her genius son Michael that he was born when she was 22 instead of 16 years old, and always says he is the one thing she has done well. She and Joey are friends in addition to being siblings, both having the gift of being extremely appealing to the opposite sex, with numerous lovers. Initially working as a hairdresser, by season two she works as a secretary for Joey's agent Bobbie, having impressed Bobbie with her brash manner. In season two she starts dating Michael's father Jimmy once again. In the season 2 episode \"Joey and the Holding Hands\", it is implied that Gina may be bisexual.\n\n\n\n#### Alex Garrett[edit]\n\n\n**Alexis \"Alex\" Garrett** (Andrea Anders) is Joey's next-door neighbor, landlady and friend in *Joey*. She is an educated, but slightly ditzy, blonde lawyer who graduated from Northwestern University and Pepperdine University School of Law. Initially intimidated, but also intrigued by Joey's tough street-wise older sister Gina, the two women eventually become friends and she becomes more bold in the way she dresses and acts, thanks to Gina's influence. She is puzzled but impressed by Joey's intuitive gift at being able to know when she is wearing thong panties and spends most of her time hanging out at Joey and Michael's apartment. She and Joey bond and become close friends. Her husband is a professional orchestra musician and is away from home most of the time and she confides her problems with her marriage in Joey. At the end of season one, she and Joey become romantically involved during her separation from her husband.\n\n\nIn season two, Alex becomes romantically interested in Joey and has a crush on him for a long period. Gina tries to help her to get over Joey, but once Alex starts dating Joey's friend Dean, Joey soon realizes that he is also in love with Alex. Alex and Joey start dating in season 2 and shortly before the final episode they become engaged.\n\n\nMatt LeBlanc and Andrea Anders dated in real life for several years after the cancellation of *Joey*.\n\n\n\n#### Michael Tribbiani[edit]\n\n\n**Michael Tribbiani** (Paulo Costanzo) is Joey's nephew who idolizes his Uncle Joey's ability to date many women, and who himself is sheltered and nervous around girls. He is self-conscious that he has been so sheltered and that his mother Gina breast fed him until he was seven. Early in the second season of *Joey* it is revealed that Michael has Asperger syndrome. He is a huge *Star Trek: The Next Generation* and *Star Wars* fan. He is extremely intelligent, an aerospace engineer, attends Caltech and specialises in applied thermodynamics, works with his rival Seth frequently on engineering projects, and is an obvious direct opposite from his more street-wise mother and uncle. He turns to Joey as a big brother and substitute father figure, even after his biological father Jimmy re-enters mother Gina's love life.\n\n\n\n#### Bobbie Morganstern[edit]\n\n\n**Roberta \"Bobbie\" Morganstern** (Jennifer Coolidge) is Joey's oversexed agent whom he hires after Estelle Leonard's death, and reportedly the twelfth most powerful woman in Hollywood. She has an enormous crush on Joey's nephew Michael. She often entertains herself by making her office assistant do funny tricks, or shocking herself with a stun-gun. She is brash, forward, aggressive, highly entertaining and slightly ditzy, laughing at everything and at anyone's expense, including her client Joey's. She was once sued by Phil Collins.\n\n\n\n#### Howard[edit]\n\n\n**Howard** (Ben Falcone) is Joey's friend and neighbor in *Joey*.\n\n\n\n#### Zach Miller[edit]\n\n\n**Zach Miller** (Miguel A. Núñez Jr.) is an actor who joins the cast and becomes one of Joey's best friends in the second season of *Joey*. Zach has an interesting career, going from playing extras on TV, to directing amateur plays. Zach does not appear to have a home; he was seen at one time living in Joey's trailer while working on a major blockbuster movie. In one episode, Zach and Joey, both drunk, get married in Tijuana, in a parody of Ross and Rachel marrying each other in the season-five finale of *Friends*. Zach's final appearance was in \"Joey and the Big Move\". Núñez was absent from the last five episodes, including the finale of the series, because he found another job. Zach's absence within the show was not mentioned, nor was the character at all.\n\n\n\n## Characters recurring throughout series[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Character\n | Actor\n | Season\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 5\n | 6\n | 7\n | 8\n | 9\n | 10\n |\n| **Recurring characters** |\n| Gunther\n | James Michael Tyler | Recurring |\n| Janice Litman-Goralnik\n | Maggie Wheeler | Recurring | Guest | Recurring | Guest |\n| Carol Willick\n | Jane Sibbett[b] | Recurring | Guest | Recurring | Guest |  |\n| Judy Geller\n | Christina Pickles | Recurring | Guest | Recurring | Guest | Recurring | Guest |\n| Jack Geller\n | Elliott Gould | Recurring | Guest | Recurring | Guest | Recurring | Guest |\n| Susan Bunch\n | Jessica Hecht | Recurring | Guest |  | Guest |  |\n| Marcel\n | *Katie* | Recurring |  |\n| Barry Farber\n | Mitchell Whitfield | Recurring | Guest |  | Recurring |  |\n| Mr. Heckles\n | Larry Hankin | Recurring | Guest |  |\n| Paolo\n | Cosimo Fusco | Recurring | Guest |  |\n| Ben Geller\n | Cole Sprouse | Guest | Recurring | Guest | Recurring |  |\n| Estelle Leonard\n | June Gable | Guest | Recurring | Guest |  | Guest | Recurring | Guest |  | Guest |\n| Julie\n | Lauren Tom | Guest | Recurring |  |\n| Mindy Hunter\n | Jennifer GreyJana Marie Hupp | Guest |  |\n| Fun Bobby\n | Vincent Ventresca | Guest |  |\n| Terry\n | Max Wright | Guest |  |\n| Mr. Douglas\n | Dorien Wilson | Guest |  |\n| Jasmine\n | Cynthia Mann\n | Guest |  | Recurring | Guest |  |\n| Kiki\n | Michele Maika\n | Guest |  | Guest |  |\n| Nora Tyler Bing\n | Morgan Fairchild | Guest |  | Guest |  | Recurring | Guest |  |\n| David\n | Hank Azaria | Guest |  | Guest |  | Recurring |  |\n| Steve\n | Jon Lovitz | Guest |  | Guest |  |\n| Frank Buffay Jr.\n | Giovanni Ribisi |  | Recurring | Guest |  | Guest |\n| Richard Burke\n | Tom Selleck |  | Recurring | Guest |  | Recurring |  |\n| Mr. Treeger\n | Michael G.

Subsequent episodes featured Sibbett in the role.\n\nEach of the following characters of *Friends* may or may not be particularly significant to the story of the series; each was introduced in one season and would usually appear in subsequent seasons.\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 1[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 1)\n\n#### Gunther[edit]\n\n\n**Gunther** (James Michael Tyler): The manager of the Central Perk coffee house, who first appears as a background character in \"The One with the Sonogram at the End\".[25] He is a former actor who once played Bryce on *All My Children* before that character was \"killed in an avalanche.\"[e 5] Gunther develops an unrequited crush on Rachel in the third season, which he keeps to himself until \"The Last One\".[e 4] Apart from Ross, whom he dislikes, he is on reasonably good terms with the rest of the gang despite occasionally being annoyed by wacky antics or comments from them. His motivation for disliking Ross is jealousy (as he is aware of Ross's relationship with Rachel), which is made clear numerous times, most notably in \"The One with the Morning After\" when he reveals to Rachel that Ross slept with another woman while Rachel was on a break from their relationship.[e 6] Gunther appears in a majority of the episodes, but only occasionally calls attention to himself and almost never has a large role in the plot of an episode. In \"The One with The Stain\",[e 7] Gunther is shown to be fluent in Dutch (although with a strong American accent), calling Ross an \"ezel\" as he converses with him.\n\n\nJames Michael Tyler was cast as Gunther because he was the only extra who could competently work the cappuccino machine on the Central Perk set. Tyler appears as Gunther in a co-host voice-over in the *Friends* trivia game for PS2, PC and Xbox, and in the board game *Friends: Scene It?*. *The Seattle Times* ranked Gunther as the eighth best guest character of the series in 2004.[26] When asked in 2009 by Heatworld.com what Gunther would be doing \"now\", Tyler joked, \"He'd probably have a very traditional marriage, with lots of white-haired babies running around with hair brighter than the sun.\"[27] Aside from the main cast, he appears in the most episodes.\n\n\n\n#### Jack and Judy Geller[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Elliott Gould portrayed Jack Geller, Ross and Monica's father, in 20 episodes, spanning from 1994 to 2003.\n**Jack** (Elliott Gould) and **Judy Geller** (Christina Pickles): Ross and Monica's parents. In early appearances, Jack frequently makes inappropriate comments, which he punctuates by exclaiming \"I'm just *saying*...!\", while Judy makes condescending remarks about Monica's lack of a love life and sometimes forgets her daughter even exists, while overtly favoring Ross. Jack is more balanced in his attention and care towards both Ross and Monica, though after the Gellers sell their house in season 7, it is revealed that Jack used boxes of Monica's old stuff to block rainwater from getting to his Porsche. As penance, Jack decides to gift Monica the Porsche.\n\n\nDespite each of them having their own quirks, they are occasionally dumbfounded by the crazy antics of their son and daughter, such as Ross' disastrous wedding to Emily and Monica's ridiculous speech at their 35th anniversary party. They are also sometimes bemused by the antics of the other four friends, such as idiotic or crazy comments from Phoebe and Joey, a revolting trifle cooked by Rachel, and Chandler entering a coed whirlpool alongside Jack without wearing anything underneath the towel wrapped around his waist. In the season 10 episode The One with The Cake, the couple record a message for their granddaughter's 18th birthday in which they state they might not be around by then.\n\n\nPickles was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her appearance in \"The One Where Nana Dies Twice\" in 1995.[e 8][*failed verification*] In 2004, *The Seattle Times* ranked Jack and Judy jointly as the second best guest characters of the series.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Barry Farber[edit]\n\n\n**Barry Farber** (Mitchell Whitfield): Rachel's jilted fiancé. Barry, an orthodontist, decides to go on his and Rachel's honeymoon with her maid of honor Mindy, and soon begins a relationship with her. Their relationship hits a rough patch when he and Rachel consider getting back together.[e 9] He decides to stay with Mindy, and the two are later married. Rachel is invited to the wedding, but receives a cold reception for jilting Barry while she is there, and a ridiculous speech from Ross which bemuses everyone in the room does not exactly improve the situation for her, until she, in a desperate attempt to salvage some pride, walks onto the stage where the microphone is and starts singing the Copacabana.[e 10] In the episode \"The One That Could Have Been Part 1\" Rachel mentions that Barry and Mindy have divorced after five years, when Mindy found out he was cheating on her.[e 11] Barry's last name is given as \"Finkle\" in the pilot[e 3] and \"Farber\" in every other appearance except in \"The One with the Flashback\",[e 12] where he is referred to as \"Barry Barber\". He has also been called \"Barry White\", and is possibly[*original research?*] named as an homage to long-time NY talk show host Barry Farber.\n\n\n\n#### Carol Willick and Susan Bunch[edit]\n\n\n\n**Carol Willick** (Anita Barone for the character's debut episode, Jane Sibbett thereafter) and **Susan Bunch** (Jessica Hecht): Carol is Ross' lesbian ex-wife, who came out before the pilot, and Susan is her partner. Carol divorced Ross to be with Susan. In the second episode of the series, Carol tells Ross that she is pregnant with his child,[e 13] and is having the baby with her partner Susan, though she wishes Ross to be part of the baby's life. Carol and Susan are often bemused by Ross' behavior throughout his onscreen appearances with them. Though Ross and Carol are on good terms after their divorce, Ross resents Susan for losing Carol to her.[e 14] Although Susan and Ross are initially, naturally enough, often at odds, they briefly put aside their differences when Carol gives birth to a boy, whom they all agree, after weeks of argument, to name Ben.[e 15] Carol and Susan announce their plans to get married in \"The One with the Lesbian Wedding\", but Carol's parents refuse to attend the wedding, leading Carol to doubt her decision. Ross initially hesitant to see his ex-wife remarry, finds himself in the position of being the one to encourage her to go ahead with the ceremony despite her parents' opposition. At the reception, Susan thanks Ross for his part in saving the wedding, and offers to dance with him; he agrees, apparently resolving their strained relationship.[e 16] Carol and Susan make irregular appearances until \"The One That Could Have Been\" (Susan),[e 11] and \"The One with the Truth About London\" (Carol).\n\n\nCarol and Susan were based on creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane's best friends in New York: \"We didn't create them for any particular political reason or because of lesbian chic. It was just an opportunity to tell a really interesting story.\"[28] The characters were called a positive example of a gay couple on television by GLAAD. Jessica Hecht originally auditioned to play Monica.[29]\n\n\n\n#### Marcel[edit]\n\n\n**Marcel** (live animal actor): A Capuchin monkey that Ross initially keeps as a pet,[e 17] and who provides comic relief for his geeky master. One time Rachel loses him in the city,[e 18] and calls Animal Control—only to learn from Ross that Marcel is an illegal exotic animal that cannot be kept in the city. After unsuccessfully trying to prevent animal control officer Luisa (Megan Cavanagh) from discovering that they are harboring an illegal exotic animal and bemusing her with their wacky behavior throughout these unsuccessful attempts, Rachel, Monica, Ross and Phoebe learn that Luisa is a former classmate of Rachel's and Monica's who upon recognizing Rachel attempts to spite her for snubbing her in high school by attempting to confiscate Marcel. To prevent this, Rachel threatens to tell Luisa's boss about how she shot Phoebe \"in the ass with a dart\" that had been meant for Marcel. Later, as Marcel sexually matures and begins to hump everything, Ross has to give him away to a zoo[e 19]—\"where he can have access to regular monkey-lovin'.\" Ultimately, Ross finds out that Marcel then got stolen from the zoo and taken into a life of show business, and—after starring in a liquor commercial—is starring in a movie in New York,[e 20] where they are reunited one last time. In a later season Ross questions why he had a monkey as a pet, and in another episode is mentioned during an argument with Joey. Despite Marcel being male, in reality the monkey was a female called Katie.\n\n\n\n#### Janice Litman-Goralnik[edit]\n\n\n\n**Janice Litman-Goralnik** (née **Hosenstein**) (Maggie Wheeler): Chandler's on-again, off-again girlfriend for the first four seasons. Janice is one of the few supporting characters who appears in all of the *Friends* seasons (along with Gunther and Ross and Monica's parents). She has a distinctive nasal voice, a machine gun laugh, and a thick New York accent, all of which annoy the friends, especially Joey. She first appears in \"The One with the East German Laundry Detergent\",[e 21] when Chandler breaks up with her (through Phoebe); he then invites her to New Year's in a moment of weakness, only to dump her again before midnight.[e 17] She then shows up as Chandler's blind date the night before Valentine's Day where they sleep together; Chandler breaks up with her the next day but she is fine with it, telling him she knows they will meet again.[e 22] In season two, in the wake of Mr. Heckles' death, Chandler resolves not to die alone and calls Janice, but is disappointed to discover that she is married and pregnant.[e 23] In \"The One with Barry and Mindy's Wedding\", Chandler arranges a meeting with a mystery woman over the Internet, who turns out to be Janice, who reveals that her husband is having an affair with his secretary and that they are divorcing.[e 10] To the surprise of the others, and to Joey's indignance, Chandler stays with Janice through the beginning of the third season, having fallen in love with her and no longer finding her annoying. Joey later sees Janice kissing her husband Gary while in the midst of their divorce[e 24] and tells Chandler. Chandler confronts Janice, who admits that she loves both men. However, Joey implies to Chandler that were he in his position, he would not try to interfere with Janice being happy with the father of her child. This, combined with Chandler's lingering trauma from his own parents' divorce, leads to the end of their relationship in \"The One with the Giant Poking Device\" when Chandler urges Janice to go back to her husband, not wanting to destroy her family.[e 25]\n\n\nFollowing this, Janice becomes a running gag on the show, appearing in some form in one episode per season (two in season 8 when counting \"The One Where Rachel Has a Baby\" as two separate episodes) from season 4 onwards. When Janice returns to Chandler's life, having finally gotten divorced after her reconciliation fell through, Chandler finds her insufferable again, and pretends to move to Yemen to get away from her.[e 26] In season five, Janice has a brief fling with Ross shortly after he has broken up with Emily, where he spends the entire date complaining about everything, causing her to find him insufferable and leave him, with the irony of the situation quickly dawning on him and persuading him to get his act together; she then implies to Joey that she will date him next.[e 27] She later makes a voice cameo on a mix tape that Chandler plays for Monica, having passed it off as his own and not knowing Janice had made it for him.[e 28] When Chandler and Monica become engaged, Janice re-enters their lives and, now mostly over Chandler, attempts to forcibly invite herself to the wedding; she only leaves when Monica states that Chandler still has feelings for her.[e 29] When Ross and Rachel await the birth of their daughter Emma in season 8, Janice and her new, partially-deaf husband Sid are placed in the same labor room as Rachel; she gives birth to a son, Aaron, who she jokes will be Emma's future husband. She also strongly advises Rachel that Ross will not stay around to raise the baby if they are not married, citing how her own ex-husband is largely estranged from their daughter.[e 30] In season 9, as Monica and Chandler make plans to have children, they go to a fertility clinic where Janice and Sid are coincidentally visiting; when Chandler worries about his sperm, she offers Chandler advice and support.[e 31] In season 10, Janice and her family come close to buying a house next door to the one Monica and Chandler are buying; to get rid of her, Chandler once again pretends he still loves her, causing her to become fearful that they will end up ruining their marriages if she lives next door to him, so she decides not to buy the house after all. She leaves, seemingly for good, but does kiss him one last time before she goes.[e 32]\n\n\nThroughout the series, Janice enjoys spending time with the six friends, which is ironic and very inconvenient for them, since none of them can stand to be around her.[*original research?*] She utters her catchphrase, \"*Ohhh—myyy—Gawd!*\", almost every time she re-enters the show, and Chandler sometimes imitates her with it. Janice's distinctive laugh was born out of a slip-up Wheeler made during the rehearsal of \"The One with the East German Laundry Detergent\";[e 21] after Chandler and Janice's \"More latte?\"/\"No, I'm still working on mine\" lines, Wheeler laughed.[30] *The Seattle Times* ranked Janice as the best guest character of the series in 2004.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Mr. Heckles[edit]\n\n\n**Mr. Heckles** (Larry Hankin): Monica and Rachel's downstairs neighbor, a domineering, highly unusual elderly man who constantly complains about the noise, even though the six friends are being perfectly decent in volume whenever he claims that they are disturbing him. His reason for this is never revealed, until \"The One Where Mr Heckles Dies\", in which the group discover that the noises being made in their apartment are apparently amplified in his, and when Chandler hears banging coming from the above room while in Heckles' apartment (although it is never revealed exactly what the people upstairs were doing to cause the banging) it annoys him so much that he inadvertently imitates Heckles by banging on the roof with his broom.[e 23] He appears in \"The One with Two Parts, Part 1\"[e 33] and \"The One Where the Monkey Gets Away\"[e 18] before dying in \"The One Where Mr. Heckles Dies\".[e 23] As a last spiteful act, he leaves all of his junk to \"the noisy girls in the apartment above mine\". He makes a final cameo appearance in \"The One with the Flashback\",[e 12] set in 1993, where he complains that Phoebe's noise is disturbing his oboe practice (even though he does not actually play the oboe), and inadvertently (and cruelly) causes Joey to be Chandler's roommate. He usually states that items are his, and when the other person states that he does not have one, Mr. Heckles says that he could have one. For instance, when Rachel and Phoebe are searching for the owner of a lost cat, Mr. Heckles said \"Yes, that's my cat.\" They told him he did not have a cat, to which he responded \"I could have a cat.\"\nHe also likes to bang on the ceiling with a broom when he feels people are being too loud. This appears to be how he dies when, according to Mr. Treeger, Mr. Heckles died of a heart attack, while 'sweeping'.\nHis first appearance in the series was in season 1, \"The One with the Blackout\", where he is credited simply \"as the Weird Man\".\n\n\n\n#### Paolo[edit]\n\n\n**Paolo** (Cosimo Fusco): an Italian neighbor in Rachel's building, who Rachel meets and hooks up with in \"The One with the Blackout\".[e 34] They start dating, making Ross jealous. She dumps him after he gropes Phoebe[e 35] but has a last one-night stand with him in \"The One with Ross's New Girlfriend\".[e 36] In the Italian version of the show, Paolo's name is changed to Pablo and his nationality is Spanish.\n\n\n\n#### Terry[edit]\n\n\n**Terry** (Max Wright): the original manager at Central Perk before Gunther takes the title, who does not hide the fact that he thinks Rachel is a terrible waitress and Phoebe is \"*so* bad\" as a musician. He denies Rachel an advance on her wages in \"The One Where Underdog Gets Away\"[e 37] and hires a professional musician, Stephanie Schiffer (played by Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders), to replace Phoebe in \"The One with the Baby on the Bus\".[e 38] He is last mentioned in \"The One Where Rachel Quits\", where he asks Rachel to retake the waitress training through Gunther, and when Rachel quits midway through the training, he promptly hires a new and more experienced waitress. He presumably retires in season 4 and from this point onwards Gunther becomes the sole manager at Central Perk. The role of Terry was intended by the NBC producers to be much bigger. They saw him as an older character who would provide advice to the six friends but NBC were talked out of it by the show's creators.\n\n\n\n#### Fun Bobby[edit]\n\n\n**\"Fun Bobby\"** (**Robert**) (Vincent Ventresca): Monica's alcoholic boyfriend. In his first appearance in \"The One with the Monkey\",[e 17] his \"fun\" is sapped at Monica's New Year's party after his grandfather died, but his depression does not stop Monica, annoyed that he's \"bringing her party down\" from putting a party horn in his mouth and forcing him to blow on it, to his bemusement. In \"The One with Russ\",[e 39] the gang discovers that alcohol puts the \"fun\" into Fun Bobby. Monica tries to wean him off drinking but regrets it when he becomes extremely boring. Monica then begins drinking on their dates, so that she could sit through his mind-numbingly dull stories. Bobby then breaks up with Monica, stating that he is not strong enough for a co-dependent relationship. It is revealed in the episode \"The One with Phoebe's Husband\" that the underwear on the telephone pole was Monica's when she was having sex with Fun Bobby on the terrace.[e 40]\n\n\n\n#### David[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hank Azaria played David, Phoebe's recurring love interest, in 1994, 2001 and 2003.\n**David**, \"the Scientist Guy\" (Hank Azaria): a physicist with whom Phoebe falls in love in \"The One with the Monkey\", when he receives an academic grant for a three-year research trip to Minsk (incorrectly—and consistently—described in the scripts as being in Russia, rather than Belarus).[e 17] After a quarrel with his research partner Max (Wayne Pére), Phoebe urges him to take the trip, even though it breaks her heart. Seven years later, he returns to New York for a brief visit and shares an evening with Phoebe, at the end of which he wants to say he loves her, but chooses not to as it will make it harder for him to leave.[e 41] Two years later, he returns for another visit in \"The One with the Male Nanny\", where he kisses Phoebe before she admits she is seeing Mike Hannigan, who catches them together.[e 42] He returns permanently in \"The One with the Donor\", having failed in his research, and when he finds out that Phoebe and Mike have broken up, he and Phoebe begin dating again.[e 43] In \"The One in Barbados—Part 1\", David proposes to Phoebe but is turned down in favor of Mike.[e 44]\n\n\nIn 2003, Azaria was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance.[31] Azaria originally auditioned for the role of Joey.[32]\n\n\n\n#### Nora Tyler Bing[edit]\n\n\n**Nora Tyler Bing** (Morgan Fairchild): Chandler's mother, a best-selling erotic novelist whose works include *Euphoria Unbound*, *Euphoria At Midnight* and *Mistress Bitch*. She first appears in \"The One with Mrs. Bing\",[e 45] where she meets the gang while on a book tour in New York. After dinner, she kisses Ross. She makes a cameo appearance in the flashback scenes of \"The One with All the Thanksgivings\"[e 46] and later appears in \"The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding\" (with Kathleen Turner as Chandler's dad)[e 47] and \"The One After 'I Do'\".[e 48] *The Seattle Times* ranked Nora and her ex-husband jointly as the fifth best guest characters in 2004.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Ursula Buffay[edit]\n\n\nFictional character\n\n\n\n| Ursula Buffay |\n| --- |\n| *Friends, Mad About You* character |\n| First appearance | \"Married to the Job\" (1993)(*Mad About You*) |\n| Last appearance | \"The One with the Halloween Party\" (2001)(*Friends*) |\n| Portrayed by | Lisa Kudrow |\n| In-universe information |\n| Occupation | WaitressPornographic actress |\n| Family | Frank Buffay, Sr. (father)Phoebe Abbott (birth mother)Lily Buffay (adoptive mother)Phoebe Buffay (twin sister)Frank Buffay, Jr. (half-brother)Frances (grandmother)Frank Buffay, Jr., Jr. (nephew)Leslie Buffay (niece)Chandler Buffay (niece) |\n\n\n**Ursula Pamela Buffay** (Lisa Kudrow): Phoebe's identical twin sister who lives in SoHo. Kudrow originated the role of Ursula in the sitcom *Mad About You*, playing her as an inept waitress at Riff's who frequently forgets orders.[m 1] Ursula is every bit as odd as Phoebe is, but, unlike her sister, Ursula is a selfish, amoral, abrasive, brazen and hedonistic individual who is so self-absorbed and self-centered that she often forgets things, usually treats Phoebe with disdain and is not liked by anyone who truly knows her. Phoebe refers to Ursula as her \"evil twin\". She first appears in *Friends* in \"The One with Two Parts\":[e 33] Chandler and Joey are eating at Riff's and mistake Ursula for Phoebe. Joey becomes attracted to Ursula and they start dating. Ursula tells Phoebe that she is bored with Joey and claims that he is smart enough to figure this out on his own without her having to actually tell him, so Phoebe pretends to be her sister to let Joey down gently. In the same episode, Helen Hunt and Leila Kenzle cameo as their *Mad About You* characters Jamie Buchman and Fran Devanow, in a scene where they mistake Phoebe for Ursula in Central Perk. Ursula next appears briefly in \"The One with the Jam\",[e 49] where she is being stalked by Malcolm (David Arquette) who mistakes Phoebe for her. Phoebe naively begins a relationship with the man in question, but ends it with him when he cannot get over his obsession with Ursula. In \"The One with the Jellyfish\"[e 50] Phoebe tells Ursula that she has met their birth mother (Teri Garr), but Ursula already knows about her. In \"The One Where Chandler Can't Cry\",[e 51] Phoebe starts getting unwanted attention from men, and discovers that Ursula is starring in pornographic films using Phoebe's name, including a film called *Buffay The Vampire Layer*. Phoebe gets revenge by claiming Ursula's paychecks and embarrassing her many male fans. Flashbacks in \"The One Where They All Turn Thirty\"[e 52] reveal that Ursula sold Phoebe's birth certificate to a Swedish runaway, and that both sisters are thirty-one, not thirty. In \"The One with the Halloween Party\",[e 53] Ursula introduces Phoebe to Eric (Sean Penn), her fiancé. Phoebe is horrified that Ursula has lied to Eric that she is a teacher, a member of the Peace Corps, a non-smoker, and attends a church group; so she tells Eric the truth, upon which he breaks up with Ursula. The series finale of *Mad About You*, set 22 years into the future, reveals that Ursula becomes Governor of New York.[m 2]\n\n\n\n#### Mindy Hunter-Farber[edit]\n\n\n\n**Mindy Hunter-Farber** (Jennifer Grey in \"The One with the Evil Orthodontist\",[e 9] Jana Marie Hupp in \"The One with Barry and Mindy's Wedding\"[e 10]): Rachel's maid of honor at her abortive wedding to Barry. Mindy and Rachel were best friends while growing up and their friendship is tested after Rachel discovers Mindy and Barry are seeing each other. She asks Rachel to be her maid of honor and dress in a garish pink dress. Mindy marries Barry in \"The One with Barry and Mindy's Wedding\";[e 10] but he later cheats on her and she has divorced him by \"The One That Could Have Been, Part 1\".[e 11]\n\n\n\n#### Ben Geller[edit]\n\n\n**Ben Geller** (Various actors, 1995–1999; Cole Sprouse, 2000–2002): Ross and Carol's son, born during \"The One with the Birth\".[e 15] Ben is played as an infant by Michael Gunderson, by brothers Charles Thomas Allen and John Christopher Allen from season 3 to 5, and by Sprouse from season 6 to 8.\n\n\n\n#### Julie[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lauren Tom played Julie.\n**Julie** (Lauren Tom): an old graduate school colleague of Ross, whom he meets again while on a trip to China; she first appears in the final scene of the season 1 finale.[e 54] They start dating but break up soon after, when Ross reveals he loves Rachel.[e 55] During the entire time Julie and Ross were dating, Rachel hated the relationship because about a week before Ross came home from China, Rachel discovered that Ross was in love with her. This made Rachel's feelings for Ross grow at a fast rate, making her jealous of Julie's relationship with him. At the end \"The One with Russ\", Julie returns and falls in love with Ross' doppelgänger Russ, with the episodes' writer describing them as still being together by 2020. The scene where Rachel speaks slowly to Julie at the airport was based upon the real-life experience of actress Lauren Tom.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Steve[edit]\n\n\n**Steve** (Jon Lovitz): a restaurant owner and drug addict whom Phoebe knows. In 1995, Monica tries to impress him in an attempt to get a job at his restaurant, and Phoebe tells him he is welcome to go to her apartment and try her food there, but he gets stoned on the journey there and consequently acts obnoxious. At the end of the episode, Phoebe punishes him by giving him a very painful massage.[e 56] His drug problem eventually causes him to lose his restaurant, and, in 2003, Phoebe later fixes Rachel up with him (and Ross with nobody) on a blind date, as part of a secret strategy to get Rachel and Ross back together.[e 57]\n\n\n\n#### Ugly Naked Guy[edit]\n\n\n**Ugly Naked Guy** (Jon Haugen): A tenant in the apartment in the building across from Monica's apartment—who frequently, perhaps invariably, is naked with the drapes open—so the gang is frequently commenting on his activities—playing cello, wearing \"gravity boots\", etc. He is first mentioned in the second episode of the series,[e 13] but only appears twice: first, his belly and an arm are shown in \"The One with the Giant Poking Device\"[e 25]—in which he is being poked from across the street by the gang (who think he is dead) with a long device made from chopsticks; second, a rear view of him from head to waist is shown in \"The One Where Everybody Finds Out\"[e 58] (his final show)—in which he is moving out of his apartment and Ross tries to get the apartment by ingratiating himself with Ugly Naked Guy by cavorting with him in the nude. (In \"The One with the Flashback\",[e 12] it is learned that he used to be \"Hot Naked Guy\", but then, in 1993, started putting on weight).\n\n\nFor many years, the identity of the actor that played him in his extremely limited appearances was a mystery. It was speculated that Michael G. Hagerty, the actor who played Mr. Treeger, was Ugly Naked Guy. However, Hagerty denied this theory. On May 31, 2016, an article was published by Todd Van Luling in *The Huffington Post*, detailing his search for the identity of Ugly Naked Guy. His article revealed that an actor named Jon Haugen played the role.[33]\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 2[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 2)\n\n#### Mr. Treeger[edit]\n\n\n**Mr. Treeger** (Michael G. Hagerty): the superintendent of Monica's building, who first appears in \"The One Where Heckles Dies\",[e 23] when he shows Mr. Heckles's lawyer to Monica and Rachel's apartment. He next appears in \"The One with Phoebe's Dad\",[e 59] in which Ross thinks he is soliciting a bribe to fix Monica and Rachel's broken radiator (after they gave cookies instead of cash as Christmas tips and angered most of the servicepeople), when in fact Treeger actually appreciated the personal touch of the cookies. In season 4, when Joey rebuffs him for (gently) insulting Rachel in a moment of pique,[e 60] he threatens to have Monica and Rachel evicted unless Joey helps him practice ballroom dancing to impress a woman. In \"The One with the Free Porn\",[e 61] he cleans the shower drain of Chandler and Joey's newly won apartment, and warns them never to turn off their TV after they start receiving free porn. In his final on-screen appearance,[e 62] he has a fireman break down the door to Monica's apartment after Joey tells him he smells gas while she and Chandler are away on their honeymoon.\n\n\n\n#### Estelle Leonard[edit]\n\n\n**Estelle Leonard** (June Gable): Joey's talent agent. She is usually seen wearing colorful clothes, heavy make-up, and a bouffant. She chain smokes and has a strong New York accent. Gable's first appearance as Estelle, in \"The One with the Butt\",[e 63] was cut for time, though the character appears off-screen when she signs Joey and lands him his first film role, playing Al Pacino's butt-double. The cut scene is included in the episode's DVD release. Her first on-screen appearance comes in season 2's \"The One with Russ\",[e 39] where she gets Joey a recurring part in *Days of Our Lives*. Although she is shown to be supportive of Joey's career throughout the show, in \"The One Where Joey Loses His Health Insurance\"[e 64] it is suggested she has instead been bad-mouthing him after mistakenly assuming he has found another agent. She dies in the final season,[e 32] and Joey speaks at her memorial service, where it is revealed that by that point she represented only two clients — Joey and a man whose act is eating paper.\n\n\nWhen Gable auditioned for the role, she played Estelle quite plainly and was encouraged to \"go away and do something with her\". She returned to the audition room wearing a \"fat suit\" and eating a sandwich from a delicatessen, which she stubbed out a cigarette on. The performance was used in the deleted scene of \"The One with the Butt\".[e 63] Her age is never given but Gable believed that she was in her 80s.[34] In 2004, *The Seattle Times* ranked Estelle as the sixth-best guest character of the series.[26] Gable also plays the nurse who delivers Ben in \"The One with the Birth\".\n\n\n\n#### Richard Burke[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tom Selleck played Monica's boyfriend Dr. Richard Burke in several episodes between 1995 and 2000.\n**Dr. Richard Burke** (Tom Selleck): an ophthalmologist and close friend of Jack Geller. Richard is introduced when Monica caters an event for him in \"The One Where Ross and Rachel … You Know\".,[e 65] and they begin dating despite their 21-year age difference. Ross is initially upset, but becomes supportive of their relationship, especially when Monica decides to tell their parents. This does not go well at first, but even Monica's parents have to admit that they've never seen Richard happier and that he's not just \"fooling around\" with a younger woman.[e 66] He and Monica break up in \"The One with Barry and Mindy's Wedding\"[e 10] when he tells her he does not want more children, his own having already grown up (and had children of their own). Despite the two still being in love, they cannot reconcile this difference, and are both devastated for months. He makes a brief voice cameo in \"The One Where No One's Ready\",[e 67] and later they briefly attempt to rekindle their romance as \"friends\" before accepting that the reasons they broke up remain valid.[e 68] In \"The One in Vegas\", Monica and Richard bump into each other off-screen and have lunch together. Monica does not feel anything for Richard but refrains from telling Chandler because of their upcoming anniversary. When he learns the truth, they fight for most of the episode until Monica assures Chandler that she will never see Richard again. In \"The One with the Proposal\",[e 69] he runs into Monica and Chandler at dinner. While Chandler is planning to propose but pretends to be against marriage because he \"wants it to be a surprise\", Richard stuns Monica by telling her that he still loves her, and wants to marry her and have kids with her. Monica rejects him but later arrives at his apartment, frustrated with her own situation. She complains to him for a bit about how bad things are going in her love life before leaving to think things over. Eventually, Chandler comes to his apartment searching for Monica and tells Richard of his own proposal plan. Richard seems to lack sympathy for Chandler at first, responding to Chandler explaining away his plan to make her initially think he was against marriage by stating it had \"worked very well\" but when Chandler angrily tells him he has no right to ruin another man's relationship with her because he's already ruined his own, he realizes Chandler is right and tells him, \"You go get her, Chandler. And can I give you a bit of advice? If you get her, don't let her go. Trust me\" — noting that he hates the fact that he is a nice guy when Chandler thanks him. His apartment is put up for sale in season 9, in \"The One with Ross's Inappropriate Song\",[e 70] but Richard is not seen. While there, Chandler finds out that Richard made a sex tape with Monica which he steals and watches, but he and Monica later discover that Richard taped over her, relieving Chandler but leaving Monica feeling insulted.\n\n\nAll of Selleck's entrances in season 2 had to be refilmed after the audience left because \"it was like The Beatles with the screaming and the applause\".[35] Selleck was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series[36] in 2000 for his appearance in \"The One with the Proposal\". In 2004, *The Seattle Times* ranked Richard as the third-best guest character of the series.[26]\n\n\n\n\n#### Sandra Green[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Marlo Thomas played Sandra Green, Rachel, Jill and Amy's mother, who divorced Rachel's father in season 2, and appears in various episodes from then on.\n**Sandra Green** (Marlo Thomas): Rachel's overprotective mother. In \"The One with the Lesbian Wedding\",[e 16] she announces to Rachel that she never loved Rachel's father and is divorcing him. (\"You didn't marry your Barry, honey—but *I* married *mine*.\") She later accompanies everyone to Carol and Susan's wedding. In \"The One with the Two Parties\",[e 71] she arrives at Rachel's birthday party and is unaware for the whole night that her ex-husband is also there, as the six friends successfully prevent them from finding out each other are there by setting up two different parties, bemusing them both with their strange, wacky behavior in the process; Joey even ends up kissing Sandra to distract her from her ex-husband's departure. In \"The One with the Baby Shower\",[e 72] she is invited at the last minute to attend Rachel's baby shower, where she offers to move in with Ross and Rachel to help with the baby's first months; Rachel first accepts, then Ross makes her change her mind. When Rachel was planning to move to Paris, Sandra would fly out with Emma a few days later. However this never happens as Rachel chooses to remain in New York with Ross.\n\n\nFor her appearance in \"The One with the Lesbian Wedding\", Thomas was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 1996.[37]\n\n\n\n#### Frances[edit]\n\n\n**Frances** (Audra Lindley): Phoebe's grandmother by her mother Lily. Her only appearance is in \"The One with Phoebe's Dad\",[e 59] where she reveals to Phoebe that the person in the pictures she keeps around the house is not Phoebe's father, which motivates Phoebe to try to track down her real father. When Phoebe leaves Frances’ house to go and find her father, she kisses goodbye to a picture of her \"grandfather\", which is in fact a picture of Albert Einstein. Though the character appears in only one episode, she is mentioned in a few more, including in season 5's \"The One with Joey's Bag\",[e 73] where it is revealed that she has recently died and Phoebe plans her funeral. Phoebe inherits her grandmother's yellow taxi and apartment. She keeps the taxi until the very end of the series.\n\n\n\n#### Frank Buffay Jr.[edit]\n\n\n\n**Frank Buffay Jr.** (Giovanni Ribisi): Phoebe and Ursula's half-brother by their father. In \"The One with the Bullies\",[e 74] Phoebe meets him after finding the courage to knock on her father's suburban door, but learns from Frank Jr.'s mother (played by Laraine Newman) that her father walked out several years ago. Despite not finding her father, she connects with Frank Jr. who later visits the city[e 75] where he hits on Jasmine, one of Phoebe's coworkers, and mistakes her massage parlor for a whorehouse. He eventually falls in love with and becomes engaged to Alice Knight (Debra Jo Rupp), his former home-economics teacher who is 26 years his senior.[e 76] In \"The One with Phoebe's Uterus\",[e 1] Frank and Alice ask Phoebe to be a surrogate mother for their child, and she later gives birth to their triplets, whom she then says goodbye to in an emotional scene in \"The One Hundredth\".[e 2] Frank makes a final appearance in \"The One Where Ross is Fine\",[e 77] when he and the triplets meet Phoebe at Central Perk. In the episode, he claims he \"hasn't slept in four years\" and is so exhausted with raising the triplets he even proposed that Phoebe take one for her own. However, he soon realizes he loves his children too much to give any of them up; Phoebe proposes to start babysitting them so that Frank and Alice can enjoy some more time off.\n\n\nPreviously, Ribisi appeared in \"The One with the Baby on the Bus\" as a stranger who leaves a condom rather than money in Phoebe's guitar case when she is singing on the street, then comes back to retrieve it. It was never addressed if this was intended to be the same character as Frank, who had not yet been introduced by name.[e 38]\n\n\nIn 2004, *The Seattle Times* ranked Frank as the fourth-best guest character of the series.[26] Alice was only scheduled to appear in the one episode but was brought back for a recurring role after the surrogacy storyline—which was created when actor Lisa Kudrow became pregnant.[38]\n\n\n\n#### Leonard Green[edit]\n\n\n**Dr. Leonard Green** (Ron Leibman): Rachel, Jill and Amy's father, a surly, abrasive and rather amoral vascular surgeon; although he is genuinely affectionate and usually good-natured towards his daughter, he is generally a mean-spirited, nasty and disrespectful bully who is quick to insult anyone who, even by accident, irritates him in the slightest way, even if an insult was not intended. He takes an instant dislike to his daughter's boyfriend Ross when the latter refers to Green's profession as \"a game\".[e 71] Later, when Ross and Rachel conceive a child (Emma), he becomes furious that they're not engaged because he does not want his grandchild to be a bastard and ends up going to Ross' apartment and shouting at him because Rachel (who is afraid of Leonard's anger) lied to him and claimed that Ross refused to ask her to marry him, leading Rachel to eventually clarify the situation for him. However, he is still angry at her and believes love to be insignificant in a marriage.[e 78] He has a heart attack in \"The One Where Joey Speaks French\"[e 79] and is recovering in the hospital when Rachel arrives with Ross, who he once again treated with contempt.\n\n\nAlthough Leonard, like his daughter Amy, was a deliberately unpleasant and unlikeable character, the comic relief he provided caused him, again like his daughter Amy, to become memorable as a character fans[*clarification needed*] \"loved to hate.\"[*original research?*] As of 2020, Ron Leibman is the only one of the actors playing the group's parents to have died.\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 3[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 3)\n\n#### Mark Robinson[edit]\n\n\n**Mark Robinson** (Steven Eckholdt) first appears in \"The One Where Chandler Can't Remember Which Sister\", offering to get Rachel an interview at Bloomingdale's after overhearing her complaining to Monica about her current job. Ross is immediately jealous of Mark, and this, combined with Rachel's staggering obliviousness to Mark's obvious crush on her, puts a strain on their relationship, as Ross overcompensates by smothering Rachel. Although Mark quits Bloomingdale's for a different job in \"The One with Phoebe's Ex-Partner\", he and Rachel make plans to attend a fashion seminar together. After Ross and Rachel fight and Rachel suggests \"taking a break,\" Mark insists, over Rachel's protests, on coming to her apartment to comfort her (doing the same thing she had been mad at Ross for doing: not listening to her wishes and doing whatever he wants); when Ross calls and overhears Mark's voice, he mistakenly believes Mark is there to have sex with Rachel and, believing that their relationship is now over, gets drunk and sleeps with Chloe.[e 80] Weeks after their breakup, Mark asks Rachel on a date and she accepts, but she ultimately rejects his advances when she realizes she only accepted to get back at Ross.[e 81] After saying that he will \"get back at [Ross]\" by himself later, Mark is not seen again until season 10, \"The One with Princess Consuela\",[e 82] where he encounters Rachel and Ross after she has been fired from Ralph Lauren, and takes her out to dinner where he offers her a new job with Louis Vuitton in Paris. Ross fails to recognize him but becomes hostile all over again once reminded, even declaring his extreme hatred of Mark and forbids Rachel of going to dinner with him and with both of Ross and Rachel's breakups in seasons 3 and 4, oddly being unmentioned. It is also revealed that since his previous appearance he has married and had kids (twins, actually) – once informed of this, an embarrassed Ross wonders: \"Should we send something?\" Though Ross attempts to counter Mark's job offer by getting Rachel her job back at Ralph Lauren, he eventually relents upon realizing Rachel wants to go to Paris. However, when Ross confesses to Rachel at the airport that he is still in love with her, Rachel gets off the plane at the last minute to reunite with him, turning down Mark's job offer.\n\n\n\n#### Sophie[edit]\n\n\n**Sophie** (Laura Dean): Mark's replacement. Sophie is frequently abused by her boss Joanna and occasionally bewildered by ridiculous comments from Chandler (who had a brief relationship with Joanna). In the episode \"The One Where They're Going to *Party!*\",[e 83] she is ecstatic about Joanna's death.\n\n\n\n#### Joanna[edit]\n\n\n**Joanna** (Alison LaPlaca): Rachel's boss, who despite being occasionally bewildered by his ridiculous comments, dates Chandler in two episodes (once in season 3,[e 84] once in season 4[e 85]). She is hostile to her assistant, Sophie, but usually good-natured towards Rachel. After deliberately sabotaging Rachel's promotion in order to keep her, she finally offers Rachel a promotion within her own department,[e 83] but is knocked down and killed by a cab before she can effect it.\n\n\n\n#### Doug[edit]\n\n\n**Douglas \"Doug\"** (Sam McMurray): Chandler's new boss in \"The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion\".[e 86] Doug enjoys calling Chandler \"*Bing!*\" and slapping his male colleagues on the butt. Monica and Chandler play a game of tennis with Doug and his wife, who are left exhausted, irritated and bewildered by Monica's ridiculously overly-competitive attitude in \"The One with Chandler's Work Laugh\" (January 21, 1999; season 5, No. 12). In this episode, it is implied that he, his wife, and the rest of Chandler's co-workers all dislike Joey, whom Chandler claims damaged his reputation in their eyes (presumably with all his stupidity) after he invited him to a work office party, damage repaired by Monica when he invited her to a different one. In \"The One with Ross's Step Forward\" (airdate December 13; 2001; season 8, No. 11), he invites Monica and Chandler to dinner to celebrate his divorce. To get out of it, Chandler pretends that he wants to be on his own because he and Monica have split up but it backfires when Doug, who despite his seemingly cheerful and relieved attitude towards his divorce is in reality clearly depressed over it, tries to cheer Chandler up by taking him to strip clubs, drunkenly throwing cans at birds and throwing (Doug's) wedding ring into the gutter (Chandler had refused Doug's offer at first, but then made the mistake of thoughtlessly stating his reason for this as being that Monica would not appreciate it, only to then be forced to correct himself upon seeing Doug's confused expression). It is also revealed in this episode that he urinated on an ice sculpture during Monica and Chandler's engagement party, and this is why he was not invited to the wedding.\n\n\n\n#### Bonnie[edit]\n\n\n**Bonnie** (Christine Taylor): Phoebe's formerly bald friend, first mentioned in the episode \"The One with the Candy Hearts\" (although referred to as 'Abby' then), whom she sets up with Ross in \"The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion\". Rachel met Bonnie two years prior to the events of this episode, and remembers her as a \"weird bald chick\"; however, when Rachel meets her she is horrified to see that her hair has actually grown back and she is actually a very attractive woman. Since Rachel still has feelings for Ross, she, in a successful attempt to sabotage his relationship with Bonnie, convinces her to shave her hair off again in \"The One at the Beach\" (airdate May 15, 1997; season 3, No. 25). She makes a brief appearance at the beginning of \"The One with the Jellyfish\", when Ross decides to dump her and get back together with Rachel. He implies that he made a dreadful mess of breaking up with her, both upsetting and enraging her in the process.\n\n\n\n#### Phoebe Abbott[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Teri Garr played Phoebe's birth mother, Phoebe Abbott, in three episodes of seasons 3 and 4.\n**Phoebe Abbott** (Teri Garr): Phoebe's birth mother. Phoebe tracks her down in \"The One at the Beach\", believing her to be a friend of Lily's. She reveals her parentage at the end of the episode and makes amends with Phoebe in \"The One with the Jellyfish\". Later, when Phoebe wants to be a surrogate mother for Frank and Alice's child,[e 1] she lends Phoebe her puppy to demonstrate how difficult it is to give up children after carrying them.\n\n\n\n#### The Chick and the Duck[edit]\n\n\n\n**The Chick** and **the Duck** (live animal actors): Chandler and Joey's pet birds. In \"The One with a Chick and a Duck\", Joey adopts a chick from an animal sanctuary, misunderstanding a news report about people who buy chicks and then find they cannot properly care for them. Encouraged by Phoebe to return the chick, but discovering that the animals would be euthanized, Chandler, who went to give the chick back, returns home with the chick and a duck. Chandler and Joey treat the chick and the duck as their own children—at one point, Chandler punishes the duck by sending him out to the hall (\"You stay out here and think about what you did!\").\n\n\nChandler briefly names the chick \"Yasmine\", after *Baywatch* actress Yasmine Bleeth (the chick later, however, turns out to be a rooster, not a hen); and in \"The One with Ross's Thing\", Chandler refers to the possible offspring of the duck and the chick as \"Dick\", while Joey refers to it as \"Chuck\". By season 6 the animals disappeared; the duck was mentioned but not seen in season 7. In the final episode of the series,[e 4] Joey bought Chandler a new duckling and chick as a housewarming gift—which Joey names \"Duck Jr.\" and \"Chick Jr.\"—and it is revealed that the original birds died a while ago, and Chandler, not wanting Joey to be upset about it, told him that they had gone to live on a farm, where visitors were not allowed.\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 4[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 4)\n\n#### Stu[edit]\n\n\nStuart \"Stu\" (Fred Stoller): a waiter at the restaurant Allesandro's, where Monica gets a job in \"The One Where They're Going to Party!\" In \"The One with the Girl from Poughkeepsie\" (airdate December 18, 1997; season 4, No. 10), Stu leads a kitchen staff rebellion against Monica (his motivation being partly that she had written an extremely critical review of the restaurant's food and service in the paper prior to being hired to work there herself, which he and the rest of the staff had felt publicly humiliated by and partly that a member of his family lost his job after she replaced him as the head chef), locking her in a cold storage room and writing insults on her chef's hat. Monica hires Joey as a stooge so she can show her authority in front of the staff by firing him in front of them all, and the rebellion soon ends. In \"The One with the Stripper\",[e 78] Stu gives Monica the phone number of someone she assumes is a stripper for Chandler's belated bachelor party, though she turns out to be a prostitute.\n\n\n\n#### Emily Waltham[edit]\n\n\nEmily Waltham (Helen Baxendale): The English niece of Rachel's boss Mr. Waltham, who arrives for a two-week visit to New York in \"The One with Joey's Dirty Day\". She has a whirlwind romance with Ross and they decide to get married. Her friendly relationship with Rachel soon changes during the wedding. The friends fly to London for their wedding in \"The One with Ross's Wedding\" (airdate May 7, 1998; season 4, No. 23 & 24), and Ross accidentally says Rachel's name at the altar, humiliating Emily in front of her friends and family. She aims to reconcile with him at the airport in \"The One After Ross Says Rachel\" (airdate September 24, 1998; season 5, No. 1) but sees Rachel with him about to go on their honeymoon and storms out again. Ross tries to convince her to move to New York.[e 87] She agrees but makes him promise to get rid of everything Rachel has ever come into physical contact with, in the friends' apartments, which would be virtually impossible, and she demands that he never see Rachel again. When she learns that he's having dinner with the old gang—including Rachel—she tells him she cannot trust him and she decides to end the marriage. She makes a final voice cameo in \"The One with the Ride Along\",[e 88] when she leaves a message on Ross's answering machine the night before her new wedding, telling him she is having second thoughts about it and is worried that they made a mistake splitting up. Rachel accidentally deletes the message, but tells Ross about it and convinces him not to respond to it. Emily's surname is that of the city where both creators of the show attended college.\n\n\nPatsy Kensit was originally approached to play the role but turned it down.[39] Emily and Ross's marriage was intended to last much longer in the series, but Helen Baxendale became pregnant prior to season 5 and was unable to travel for the show; hence, her limited appearances after season 4.[40] Helen Baxendale was asked to reprise the role in season 10, but turned it down to star in the West End play *After Miss Julie*, and because she did not want the same level of tabloid attention she received in 1998.[41]\n\n\n\n#### Stephen and Andrea Waltham[edit]\n\n\n\nStephen (Tom Conti) and Andrea Waltham (Jennifer Saunders): Emily's father and shrewish stepmother, introduced in \"The One with Ross's Wedding, Part 2\". Their marriage is icy and they openly treat one another with disdain. They are equally hostile towards Jack and Judy Geller when the Gellers refuse to pay for their house to be remodelled after the wedding reception. When the wedding takes place, like all of the guests they are shocked and utterly dumbfounded when Ross accidentally says Rachel's name instead of Emily's during the vows. In \"The One After Ross Says 'Rachel'\", Stephen angrily tells Ross that consequently Emily has gone into hiding after escaping out of the bathroom window and now feels humiliated, but this does not stop Andrea from telling Ross in front of him that she thinks he (Ross) is \"delicious\". Andrea's final words onscreen are, to Ross, \"Call me.\" Stephen's final words onscreen, to Andrea in response to her flirting with Ross, are \"You spend half your life in the bathroom-why don't you ever go out the bloody window?!\"\n\n\nJennifer Saunders co-star in *Absolutely Fabulous*, June Whitfield, makes a cameo appearance as the Waltham's housekeeper in \"The One with Ross's Wedding\".\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 5[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 5)\n\n#### Mr. Zelner[edit]\n\n\nMr. Zelner (Steve Ireland): an executive at Polo Ralph Lauren, who interviews Rachel while at the same time finding her quirks hard to deal with in \"The One with Rachel's Inadvertent Kiss\".[e 89] After Rachel is promoted in season 7, he becomes a recurring character. In \"The One with Princess Consuela\", he fires Rachel after overhearing her interview with a Gucci representative.[e 82] Ross tries to get Rachel her job back by bribing Zelner: Zelner has a son called Ross who likes dinosaurs. Ross says his name is \"Ron\", shocked to hear that Zelner's son is also named Ross.[e 32]\n\n\n\n#### Kim[edit]\n\n\nKim (Joanna Gleason): a colleague of Rachel's at Polo Ralph Lauren. In \"The One Where Rachel Smokes\", Rachel thinks she is missing out on important decisions, as they are always made when Kim takes a smoking break. She tries to take up smoking so she can stay in the loop but is unsuccessful when Kim, initially bewildered by Rachel's wacky behavior throughout her attempts to join her while she is smoking, threatens to fire her if she keeps damaging her health.[e 90] Later, Kim thinks Rachel kissed Ralph Lauren in order to take her job, when it was really Phoebe who kissed \"Kenny the copy guy\". After unsuccessfully trying to deny the affair, Rachel pretends Ralph dumped her. Kim believes her when she sees what she thinks is a cold look from Ralph (appearing as himself) in the elevator.[e 91]\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 6[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 6)\n\n*Note*: All characters who were introduced in this season did not re-appear in further seasons. Consequently, they are listed in the section on this page \"Only in season 6\".\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 7[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 7)\n\n#### Tag Jones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eddie Cahill recurred as Tag Jones in six episodes of season 7 and one episode of season 8.\nTag Jones (Eddie Cahill): Rachel's inexperienced but attractive new assistant at Polo Ralph Lauren. She hires him after being promoted, not because he is the best choice for the job but because she is smitten with him.[e 92] After he also becomes interested in her they try to keep their relationship a secret from her boss Zelner; otherwise Tag's employment would be a conflict of interest.[e 93] In \"The One Where They All Turn Thirty\" Rachel breaks up with Tag when she realizes that their six-year age difference makes him too young and immature for her to be dating if she intends to follow her marriage schedule.[e 52] He reappears in \"The One with the Red Sweater\" in season eight when Phoebe thinks he is the father of Rachel's unborn baby. He tells Rachel that he has matured a lot since their break-up and wants to resume their relationship, but backs off when he finds out she is pregnant by someone else. He later meets up with Ross—who is the real father and is wearing the same kind of red sweater.[e 94]\n\n\n\n#### Charles Bing/Helena Handbasket[edit]\n\n\nCharles Bing/Helena Handbasket (Kathleen Turner): Chandler's gay dad and Nora's ex-wife, regularly referred to as an unseen character in previous seasons. Determined to invite her to their wedding in \"The One with Chandler's Dad\", Monica drags Chandler to Charles' burlesque show in Las Vegas, where she is seen for the first time, performing under the name \"Helena Handbasket\". Chandler invites her to the wedding,[e 95] and she and Nora walk Chandler down the aisle in \"The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding, Part 1\".[e 96] She does not appear at the reception in \"The One After 'I Do'\",[e 48] though a deleted scene reveals she is upstairs crying after Joey accidentally ruined her dress.\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 8[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 8)\n\n#### Emma[edit]\n\n\n\nEmma Geller-Green (Cali Sheldon & Noelle Sheldon): Rachel and Ross' infant daughter. Though Ross had originally wanted to name his daughter \"Isabella\", Rachel wound up in tears when she decided that the name did not suit the baby and was dismayed by her other remaining choice, Delilah. Monica graciously suggests \"Emma\", the name she had chosen for her own future daughter when she was fourteen, but concedes that since \"*Nothing* goes with 'Bing', so I'm screwed,\" Rachel can give the name to her own daughter.\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 9[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 9)\n\n#### Mike Hannigan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Paul Rudd played the recurring character Mike Hannigan, boyfriend and later husband of Phoebe, throughout seasons 9 and 10.\nMichael \"Mike\" Hannigan (Paul Rudd): Phoebe's boyfriend and later husband: in \"The One with the Pediatrician\" (airdate October 10, 2002; season 9, No. 3), Joey and Phoebe decide to go on a double date, promising to fix each other up with blind dates. However, Joey forgets about Phoebe's date, and wanting to prevent her from discovering this when she enquires about the name of the man he has fixed her up with, he pretends that someone called \"Mike\" will be her date. He then enters the coffee shop and desperately yells \"Mike!\" Mike Hannigan replies and is roped into the date, which does not go well as Mike accidentally makes it clear that he does not actually know Joey personally, and Joey tries to recover the situation, consequently upsetting Phoebe and turning off his own blind date Mary-Ellen in the process. Mike feels sorry for Phoebe as he watches her leave and when he spots her again in the coffee shop the next day, he speaks to her and explains that he allowed himself to be roped into the date \"because I was told that I'd get a free dinner-which I didn't-and that I'd meet a pretty girl-which I did.\" A flattered Phoebe does not turn him down when he asks her out on a second date,[e 97] which is equally bad thanks to Ross, who accidentally upsets Phoebe before it can begin, causing her to spend rather a lot of the night crying on Mike's shoulder. Ross goes to Mike's house and tries to explain to him that he had accidentally upset Phoebe, which sets off a chain of ridiculous events that result in Mike ultimately deciding he has feelings for Phoebe, and eventually, they decide to move in together;[e 98] Phoebe suggests that one day they could get married but he tells her that, after his messy divorce, he never wants to get married again, which results in them breaking up. Emotionally unable to be apart from each other, they reconcile in \"The One with the Memorial Service\" (airdate March 13, 2003; season 9, No. 17). In \"The One in Barbados, Part 1\", Monica summons Mike to Barbados, where he proposes to Phoebe at the same time as David. She turns both men down but admits that Mike is the man she wants to be with. Subsequently, Mike has to break up with Precious (Anne Dudek), the girl he has been seeing since breaking up with Phoebe, but Phoebe (who annoys Precious by calling her \"Susie\") convinces Precious to dump *him* instead.[e 99] In \"The One Where Rachel's Sister Babysits\" (airdate October 30, 2003; season 10, No. 5), he proposes to her, and they are married soon after by Joey.[e 100] When Phoebe briefly changes her name to \"Princess Consuela Bananahammock\",[e 82] he suggests changing his name to \"Crap Bag\" making her change it back. He makes a brief appearance in \"The Last One\", bringing over a \"Welcome to the World, Baby Bing\" banner to Monica and Chandler's and tells Phoebe that he also wants to have a baby, to which Phoebe agrees.\n\n\n\n#### Theodore and Bitsy Hannigan[edit]\n\n\n\nTheodore and Bitsy Hannigan (Gregory Itzin and Cristine Rose): Mike's rich, haughty parents. He introduces Phoebe to them,[e 70] and soon after they make it clear that they do not approve of Phoebe due to being both irritated and bewildered by her odd quirks, but Mike defies them and declares his love for her in front of his parents and their two \"sinfully boring\" friends (who are likewise bemused by the odd quirks of Phoebe). They later meet Joey, who confuses and bemuses them with his comments about how nice it is that \"their little ones are growing up\" (Phoebe had told him he was \"like a dad\" to her) and later attend the wedding in \"The One with Phoebe's Wedding\". His father “crushes a pill” into his wife's drink at the wedding so that she does not create a scene and she appears happy and carefree.\n\n\n\n#### Amy Green[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Christina Applegate played Amy Green.\nAmy Green (Christina Applegate): one of Rachel's two sisters, who first appears in \"The One with Rachel's Other Sister\" (airdate November 21, 2002; season 9, No. 8). She arrives at Monica and Chandler's for Thanksgiving dinner, where she is annoyed that she would not get custody of Emma if Rachel and Ross died. A boorish, hedonistic, brazen, dimwitted, amoral, materialistic and utterly unlikeable bully who could not care less about other people's feelings, she greatly irritates the friends with her cruelly honest opinions of them and selfish, self-absorbed attitude; though seems a little afraid of Monica, convinced that she is crazy (after witnessing Monica's bizarre rules when it comes to eating off the china plates she and Chandler received as a wedding present). When Rachel and Amy later have a fight after the former feels the latter has insulted Emma, which results in them accidentally breaking one of Monica's plates (causing her to nearly pass out), Chandler firmly tells both of them off as a father would do, and demands that Amy apologise for ruining Thanksgiving, for which she does. He then later hints to her that their fight was \"a major turn-on\". Rachel also makes up with Amy after offering to let her use her Ralph Lauren employee discount.\n\n\nAmy appears again in \"The One Where Rachel's Sister Babysits\", where she tells Rachel that she plans to marry her ex-boyfriend's father, who is rich. However, upon Rachel's advice to try to make it on her own, Amy calls off her engagement and sleeps over at Joey and Rachel's apartment. Rachel tries to teach her responsibility by letting her babysit Emma (who Amy calls 'Ella', insisting it is prettier), and tries to convince her to stop being so selfish and do something nice for another person. Eventually, Amy decides to take Rachel's advice and do something nice for Emma. Only trouble is, the utterly self-absorbed and self-centered Amy decides to get Emma's ears pierced. Ross and Rachel are horrified and angry at Amy, especially as she reveals she plans on becoming a baby stylist. However, Amy and Rachel make up at the end of the episode when they gossip about their sister Jill gaining a ton of weight. This was an oblique reference to Reese Witherspoon (who played Jill) being pregnant.\n\n\nAlthough Amy, like her father Leonard, was a deliberately unpleasant and unlikeable character, the comic relief she provided caused her to, again like her father Leonard, become memorable as a character that fans \"loved to hate\". In 2003, Applegate won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her appearance in \"The One with Rachel's Other Sister\" and was nominated again for her appearance in \"The One Where Rachel's Sister Babysits\".\n\n\n\n#### Charlie Wheeler[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Comedian Aisha Tyler played Joey's, then Ross', paleontologist girlfriend in seasons 9 and 10.\nCharlie Wheeler (Aisha Tyler): an attractive paleontology professor (goes to Woodroffe school) whom Ross falls for in \"The One with the Soap Opera Party\" (airdate April 24, 2003; season 9, No. 20). He plans to ask her out, but is too late when she gets together with Joey instead. Initially angry, he eventually accepts Joey and Charlie's relationship and helps Joey come up with intelligent places to take her on dates in \"The One with the Fertility Test\". At Ross's conference in \"The One in Barbados\", Charlie tells Joey that they have nothing in common and breaks up with him. She and Ross then get together. In \"The One with Ross's Grant\" (airdate November 6, 2003; season 10, No. 6), she breaks up with Ross and gets back together with her old flame, Dr. Benjamin Hobart (Greg Kinnear).\n\n\nThe character of Charlie was created in part to counter criticism the *Friends* production staff had received for featuring too few characters played by ethnic minority actors. Aisha Tyler was only the second major supporting character to be portrayed by a black actress, following Gabrielle Union's appearance as Kristen Lang in \"The One with the Cheap Wedding Dress\" (airdate March 15, 2001; season 7, No. 17).[42] The role was not specifically written for a black actor. Tyler told the *St Petersburg Times*, \"I hope [people's] frustration over [the lack of diversity] is tempered by the fact that when they wrote this role, they didn't wimp out. They wrote her so smart and sexy and elevated, she wasn't just the black girl on *Friends*.\"[43]\n\n\n\n### Introduced in season 10[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 10)\n\n![](image)Anna Faris played Erica, a young expectant woman who lets Monica and Chandler adopt her twins in season 10.\n#### Erica[edit]\n\n\nErica (Anna Faris): a young girl from Cincinnati who decides to let Monica and Chandler adopt her baby in \"The One with the Birth Mother\" (airdate January 8, 2004; season 10, No. 9). She visits New York in \"The One Where Joey Speaks French\" and sees the tourist sites with Monica and Chandler. She goes into labor at the end of \"The One with Rachel's Going Away Party\" and gives birth to twins Erica and Jack in \"The Last One\".\n\n\n\n#### Jack and Erica Bing[edit]\n\n\n\nJack and Erica Bing—the adopted son and daughter of Monica and Chandler, born in \"The Last One\". They were portrayed by Cristobal and Antonella. It is revealed that Monica and Chandler did not know they would be having twins until they were born. Chandler suggests giving one of them up but Monica refuses, saying, \"We cannot split them up. They're our children and they're coming with us.\"[e 4]\n\n\n\n#### Missy Goldberg[edit]\n\n\nMissy Goldberg (Ellen Pompeo): a woman from Ross' and Chandler's college, at which they both made a pact to not ask her out so it would not damage their friendship, introduced in \"The One Where the Stripper Cries\" (airdate February 5, 2004; season 10, No. 11). At a reunion, Chandler gives Ross permission to break the pact, now that he is married, where it is revealed that Chandler and Missy made out numerous times during college after school hours in the school's science labs, which Ross calls his \"turf\".\n\n\n\n#### Benjamin Hobart[edit]\n\n\nBenjamin Hobart (Greg Kinnear): Nobel Prize–winning paleontologist and ex-boyfriend of Ross' girlfriend Charlie Wheeler, introduced in \"The One with Ross's Grant\". After seeing Charlie again for the first time in an apparently long while and meeting Ross for the first time (who bemuses him with ridiculous comments) he eventually confesses to Ross he is still in love with her and then unsuccessfully tries to persuade Ross to break up with her. When Ross refuses, Benjamin comes to resent him and displays this resentment by asking utterly ridiculous questions at the grant interview. He and Charlie eventually get back together, after Ross makes him confess his actions in front of her.\n\n\n\n#### Amanda Buffamonteezi[edit]\n\n\nAmanda Buffamonteezi (Jennifer Coolidge): an annoying lady who used to live in the building before moving to England.[e 101] She picks up a fake English accent and claims to have slept with Evel Knievel. Her inflated ego and utterly self-absorbed attitude cause Monica and Phoebe to find her insufferable, but since they do not want to hurt the nonetheless good-natured Amanda's feelings, they agree to meet up with her in the coffee shop after Chandler ruins their original plan not to take any of her phone calls by doing exactly that and informing her that they are in the house with him, and then bemuses her by informing her that he takes pedicures before handing the phone to Monica.\n\n\nJennifer Coolidge also appears in the spin-off series Joey playing his agent.\n\n\n\n#### Roy[edit]\n\n\nRoy (Danny DeVito): a stripper in \"The One Where the Stripper Cries\", who is hired for Phoebe's bachelorette party at the last minute after she expresses disappointment that the party is not \"dirtier\". Put under pressure to quickly hire a stripper by Phoebe (who had forgotten to ask them to hire one prior to when the party actually began) they look through the phone book and call the first stripper whose number they discover, asking him to quickly arrive at Monica's apartment where the party is taking place. When he turns up, the girls are surprised to see that he is at least 50 years old, but also delusional about his physical appearance, as he clearly has trouble accepting the fact that he has not aged gracefully and is not physically appealing to women anymore. When he sees that Phoebe is not enjoying his performance he gets annoyed, particularly when she claims while cringing that \"this is how (she) looks when (she's) turned on.\" They have an argument over whether or not he should be paid for arriving after a rather difficult and rushed journey to the apartment on his part, and when she refuses to allow a sympathetic Rachel and Monica to pay him and also insults him, the sensitive stripper gets upset and cries as he is forced to accept the fact that he is no longer physically attractive, but stripping is all he knows. In her guilt, Phoebe comforts him and tells him that he should teach stripping instead. At her insistence, he then performs one last time for the party.\n\n\n\n#### Mackenzie[edit]\n\n\nMackenzie (Dakota Fanning): the daughter of the current residents of the house Monica and Chandler buy. She winds up helping Joey deal with his anxieties about Chandler and Monica moving out of the city. As a bit of revenge for Joey's overanxious behavior, Monica and Chandler briefly pretend that Mackenzie is a ghost.[e 32]\n\n\n\n## Characters appearing in only one season[edit]\n\n\nEach of the following characters of *Friends*, portrayed by a celebrity, may or may not be particularly significant to the story\n\n\n\n### Only in season 1[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 1)\n\n![](image)George Clooney (*pictured*) and Noah Wyle portray Drs. Michael Mitchell and Jeffrey Rosen, respectively. In *ER*, they portray, Drs. Doug Ross and John Carter, respectively\n#### Joseph Tribbiani Sr. and Gloria Tribbiani[edit]\n\n\n\nIn \"The One with the Boobies\" (airdate January 19, 1995; season 1, No. 13), Joey finds out that his father, Joey Sr. (Robert Costanzo), is having an affair with another woman, Ronni (Lee Garlington). Joey (the son) tries to set things right, but Gloria (Brenda Vaccaro), Joey's mother, who secretly knew about the affair all along, makes Joey change it back because her husband's been unusually nice to her since he started cheating on her.\n\n\nThough Joey's parents do not appear on the show again, Joey Sr. later makes an appearance on the spin-off series *Joey*, making Costanzo the only actor, besides Matt LeBlanc, to reprise his role from *Friends* on the series.\n\n\n\n#### Drs. Michael Mitchell and Jeffrey Rosen[edit]\n\n\n\nDrs. Michael Mitchell (George Clooney) and Jeffrey Rosen (Noah Wyle): Two doctors whom Rachel and Monica meet at a hospital and go on a date with. Monica and Rachel pretend to be each other for health insurance purposes—eventually causing things to go wild. Dr. Mitchell later saves the life of Ross's monkey, Marcel, who swallows alphabet tiles from a *Scrabble* game and nearly chokes to death.[e 33] (Clooney and Wyle were also cast as physicians on the NBC medical drama *ER* when they appeared together on *Friends*.)\n\n\n\n#### Jill Goodacre Connick[edit]\n\n\n\nJill Goodacre Connick (herself) gets trapped with Chandler in an ATM vestibule in \"The One with the Blackout\".[e 34] Chandler uses her cell phone to tell Joey and the others, engages in awkward conversion with her, and plays a \"spin the phone pen over your head\" game with her.\n\n\n\n#### Alan[edit]\n\n\nAlan (Geoffrey Lower) is Monica's boyfriend in \"The One with the Thumb\".[e 102] Everyone likes him more than Monica does. At the end of the episode Monica breaks up with him, and has the break-up talk with the other friends as if they broke up with him, too. The irony is that Alan is relieved when Monica breaks up with him as [he] 'just can't stand your friends'.\n\n\n\n#### Lydia[edit]\n\n\nLydia (Leah Remini): a single mother-to-be whose childbirth Joey assists before Carol gives birth to Ben.[e 15] Their conversations mostly revolve around whose favored basketball team is better, the Boston Celtics (Lydia) or New York Knicks (Joey). In the end, the father of Lydia's baby arrives, and Joey leaves them alone. Remini had originally auditioned for the role of Monica.\n\n\n\n#### Roger[edit]\n\n\nRoger (Fisher Stevens): a psychiatrist who Phoebe dates in \"The One with the Boobies\". The other friends take a swift dislike to him after he (very accurately) diagnoses their unconscious needs and foibles—such as Chandler's intimacy issues and Ross' guilt over being favored over Monica by their parents—and their narcissistic group dynamic. Phoebe breaks up with him, having joined the others in hating him; he is never seen again, but is mentioned in the following episode (\"The One with the Candy Hearts\") when Phoebe calls him because \"it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day\"—essentially confirming what he said about her neediness and clinginess.\n\n\n\n### Only in season 2[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 2)\n\n![](image)\nChris Isaak portrays Phoebe's date, Rob Donnan, who bans her from the library for singing songs that, as parents claim, offensively influence children.\n![](image)\nJulia Roberts portrays Susie Moss, who plots revenge on Chandler for lifting her skirt to reveal her underwear in her childhood by taking away his clothes and leaving him her underwear in the public place.\n![](image)\nBrooke Shields portrays Erika Ford, who stalks Joey and believes that Joey is Dr. Drake Ramoray, his role.\n\n\n---\nThree above pictured actors appear in \"The One After the Superbowl\" (1996).\n\n#### Caroline Duffy[edit]\n\n\nCaroline Duffy (Lea Thompson): a cartoonist. Reprising her role from *Caroline in the City*, she talks with Joey and Chandler—seeing them with Ben and consequently thinking them to be lovers—in \"The One with the Baby on the Bus\".[e 38]\n\n\n\n#### Eddie Manoick[edit]\n\n\nEddie Manoick (Adam Goldberg): Chandler's roommate after Joey moves into his own apartment, having landed the recurring role Dr. Drake Ramoray on *Days of Our Lives*.[e 66] Chandler quickly realizes they have nothing in common: Eddie hates *Baywatch*, foosball, and sports in general. When they seem to be successfully bonding, Eddie reveals his disturbed inner thoughts, and begins to show signs of mental illness, such as stealing mannequin heads from Macy's and obsessively dehydrating fruit. In \"The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies\",[e 103] he suspects Chandler of both having sex with his ex-girlfriend Tilly and killing his goldfish. He later forgets these events, but Chandler demands he move out after learning that Eddie watches him sleep.[e 5] Eddie agrees to leave but later denies the conversation took place, instead believing that he and Chandler took a weekend road trip to Las Vegas. Chandler ultimately gets rid of Eddie by allowing Joey to move back in after Joey's career falters following the death of Dr. Ramoray. They change the locks, move Eddie's stuff out into the hall, and pretend that Eddie never lived there; confused, Eddie leaves and is never seen again.\n\n\nAdam Goldberg later appeared in the second season of *Joey* as **Jimmy Costa**, the biological father of Joey's nephew, Michael.\n\n\n\n#### Rob Donnan[edit]\n\n\nRob Donnan (Chris Isaak): Rob asks Phoebe to sing for the children at a library, but the parents are horrified by her morbidly honest lyrics. However, the kids like the songs and come to the café to listen to her, and Phoebe teaches Rob \"Smelly Cat\".[e 20] Isaak's song \"Wicked Game\" plays in the background when Rachel and Ross sleep together for the first time (\"The One Where Ross and Rachel...You Know\").\n\n\n\n#### Zoo staff[edit]\n\n\n\nThe Zoo Administrator (Fred Willard) of the zoo Ross sent Marcel to, who tries to cover up a break-in in which Marcel is kidnapped and forced into show business. When Ross visits the zoo to visit Marcel, the administrator lies and tells Ross that Marcel has died. Ross later learns the truth about what happened from an unusual janitor (Dan Castellaneta), an unusual man with a strange fascination for the animals in the zoo.[e 20]\n\n\n\n#### Susie Moss[edit]\n\n\nSusie \"Underpants\" Moss (Julia Roberts): an old childhood friend of Chandler, who's working on the production of a movie,[e 20] and with whom Chandler has a colored history: when they were in elementary school, Chandler pulled up Susie's skirt when she was on stage, revealing her underwear to the entire school, and she never lived it down until she graduated high school. They arrange a date, Chandler unsuspecting that it is a plot to get revenge. After convincing him to wear her panties, Susie takes him out to dinner, undresses him in the men's room, and takes off with his clothes—leaving him in a bathroom stall wearing nothing but her panties. She is never seen again. Julia Roberts and Matthew Perry briefly dated in real life.\n\n\n\n#### Jean-Claude Van Damme[edit]\n\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme (himself):\nan actor in the movie Susie's producing, over whom Rachel and Monica compete for attention. Monica has a crush on him but is too shy to ask him out; so Rachel attempts to on her behalf, but he says he'd rather go out with her (Rachel). Rachel asks Monica for permission, which she unhappily gives. After Rachel goes on the date with him it causes a fight between her and Monica that ends with Rachel telling Monica that she will not see him anymore, so that Monica can go out with him. When Monica goes on her date with him, she finds out he only agreed to go out (with Monica) because Rachel told him that Monica was \"dying to have a threesome with him and Drew Barrymore\".

When Pete offers her a job in his restaurant, she turns him down, not wanting to hurt his feelings, but a goodbye kiss from Pete finally awakens her feelings. Monica thinks he is going to propose in \"The One with Ross's Thing\"; instead, he tells her he wants to become an Ultimate Fighting Champion. He gets badly beaten by Tank Abbott,[e 86] and every other fighter he encounters, and Monica reluctantly ends their relationship after he refuses to quit despite his increasingly debilitating injuries.\n\n\nThe character of Pete was conceived as \"a Bill Gates billionaire genius scientist-type\" to whom Monica was not attracted. The producers and casting director had difficulty finding an actor to play Pete as they wanted, \"someone who was appealing enough that we liked him, so we could root for him, but on the other hand, wasn't so drop-dead male model gorgeous that we would go, 'What's your problem?' to Monica when she didn't fall for him.\"[45]\n\n\n\n#### Kate Miller[edit]\n\n\nKate Miller (Dina Meyer): Joey's co-star in the play *Boxing Day*.[e 81] Joey falls for her, and she sleeps with him, but she is already dating the director, Marshall Townend, and sees Joey as a one-night stand.

Ross tries to warn Rachel and the other friends, but they do not believe him, assuming he's just jealous. However, Tommy's true colours are exposed when all six friends see him lose his temper after Joey and Chandler's pet baby chicken urinates in his hand and he screams at both it and their pet duck. Accepting, to his own chagrin, that the others are now afraid of him, he breaks up with Rachel and is never seen again.\n\n\n\n#### Isabella Rossellini[edit]\n\n\nIsabella Rossellini (herself): Rossellini visits Central Perk at the end of the episode \"The One with Frank Jr.\" One of the episode's plotlines involved Ross and Rachel compile lists, each of 5 people (celebrities) they can have sex with; Rossellini was originally on Ross' list, but he replaces her with Winona Ryder because Rossellini is \"international\", and thus will never be around...only to see Rossellini herself. Rachel encourages Ross to pursue her, knowing he'll get shot down; Rossellini is somewhat charmed and intrigued by Ross's \"list,\" but leaves after seeing that she is not on the final version (quipping that she has a list of five coffee house guys, but she has just bumped Ross off her list).\n\n\n\n#### Tomas and Tim[edit]\n\n\n\nTomas (Robin Williams) and Tim (Billy Crystal): two strangers at the coffee shop.

Eventually Tim reveals how he's sleeping with Tomas' wife; bursting into tears, Tomas starts shouting at and insulting Tim, and leaves the shop in a loud fury, followed by Tim, who gives the six shocked, bewildered friends one last embarrassed, apologetic look before he leaves.

Although Chandler is initially uncomfortable about the possibility of their relationship becoming sexual as he would be directly compared to Joey, Monica and Rachel are able to give Chandler some pointers. Sometime later, Chandler goes to see Kathy in a play and becomes jealous of her steamy onstage sex scenes with her co-star, Nick. Chandler starts to suspect that she is cheating on him; when he confronts her about it, she leaves, offended, and Chandler assumes the worst.

He is last seen looking bemused but amused when Joey enters the room wearing Phoebe's maternity pants (under the deluded belief that he would need to change into a new pair of pants to achieve his goal of eating an entire turkey all by himself). Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston in real life at the time, and his given name is in fact \"William\".\n\n\n\n#### Jim Nelson[edit]\n\n\nJim Nelson (James LeGros): a bully who asks Phoebe out on a date, then to amuse himself intimidates her with a number of creepy, vulgar comments, causing her to walk out on him. Appears in \"The One with The Tea Leaves\".\n\n\n\n#### Parker[edit]\n\n\nParker (Alec Baldwin): an extremely energetic and optimistic man Phoebe meets at the dry cleaner in \"The One with the Tea Leaves\". He next appears in \"The One in Massapequa\" (airdate March 28, 2002; season 8, No. 18), where he meets the other five friends and annoys them with his habit of making a big fuss over everything, even the most trivial things. At Jack and Judy Geller's anniversary party, he drives everyone crazy by getting excited by anything and everything he sees. Phoebe overhears her friends making fun of Parker and scolds them, but he soon begins to irritate her as well. At her apartment after the party, unable to listen to him anymore, Phoebe snaps and angrily tells him she wants him to be \"much less happy\"; he breaks up with her...only to return, excited, to compliment Phoebe on the argument they just had.\n\n\n\n#### \"Sick Bastard\" and \"Evil Bitch\"[edit]\n\n\n\n\"Sick Bastard\" (Jimmy Palumbo) and \"Evil Bitch\" (Debi Mazar), the couple who are having a child and with whom Rachel, who is waiting to have her baby delivered, shares a semi-private room. The woman is apparently in pain and deeply frustrated about it, and the fact that her perverted husband keeps leering at Rachel earns him the brunt of her frustrations.\n\n\n\n### Only in season 9[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Friends (season 9)\n\n#### Leonard Hayes[edit]\n\n\nLeonard Hayes (Jeff Goldblum), a director who thinks Joey does not act \"urgent enough\"; he gets a bad first impression of Joey when he mistakenly thinks the latter is making fun of him in their conversation shortly after they first meet, but quickly comes around when he realizes that Joey is actually complimenting him in his own way. When Joey does the audition while needing to urinate, Leonard is impressed by the newfound urgency in his performance, so the former drinks a lot of liquids in preparation for the second audition. All goes well in the aforementioned second audition—that is until Leonard, failing to realize that Joey needs to urinate, makes the mistake of telling him to \"relax\" causing him to wet his pants on the spot—to Leonard's chagrin.[e 132]\n\n\n\n#### Gavin Mitchell[edit]\n\n\nGavin Mitchell (Dermot Mulroney), Rachel's temporary replacement at Polo Ralph Lauren. Zelner makes it known to Rachel that he likes Gavin, so Rachel ends her maternity leave early to compete with him in \"The One Where Rachel Goes Back to Work\" (airdate January 9, 2003; season 9, No. 11). Their working relationship has improved by \"The One with Phoebe's Rats\", and they kiss at her birthday party. In \"The One Where Monica Sings\" (airdate January 30, 2003; season 9, No. 13), Rachel tells Gavin that, although she likes him, a relationship would be difficult because of her history with Ross.\n\n\n\n#### Steve[edit]\n\n\nSteve (Phill Lewis): Chandler's boss at his internship. Appears in \"The One Where Rachel Goes Back to Work\", \"The One with the Mugging\" and \"The One with the Lottery\", when he offers Chandler the job of junior copywriter.\n\n\n\n#### Molly[edit]\n\n\nMolly (Melissa George): Emma's hot nanny, whom Ross gets to hire since Rachel does not see it in her.[e 133] When Joey sees her, his lady killer instinct kicks in. Ross tries to make Joey stay away from her when he flirts with her, which makes Joey want her more. Ross wants Chandler to watch Joey and make sure he does not go after Molly. When Ross is lecturing Joey there is a knock on the door and it is Molly's girlfriend. They kiss, and Ross no longer has a problem—although Joey's even more turned on by her lesbian status. Molly makes one more cameo appearance, in \"The One Where Monica Sings\" (airdate January 30, 2003; season 9, No. 13).\n\n\n\n#### Sandy[edit]\n\n\nSandy (Freddie Prinze Jr.): Emma's first nanny.[e 42] After unsuccessfully interviewing several female nannies, both Ross and Rachel are surprised to see that Sandy is male. During the interview he wins Rachel over and she hires him despite Ross not being keen. Sandy proves himself to be highly competent, advising Ross and Rachel that toy dinosaurs he found in the apartment were not age-appropriate for Emma (only for Ross to tell him that they were his [Ross'] toys, causing a bemused Sandy to reply \"Also not age-appropriate\") and even educating the idiotic Joey with his techniques; however, he is let go after Ross cannot get used to the idea of having a male nanny, but not before convincing the latter to break down in tears when reminiscing about his bad experience with his father.\n\n\n\n#### Zach[edit]\n\n\nZach (John Stamos), a prospective sperm donor for Monica, who finds out that Chandler cannot get her pregnant.[e 43]\n\n\n\n#### Wendy[edit]\n\n\nWendy (Selma Blair), a philandering co-worker of Chandler's in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who tries to seduce him when he's forced to spend Christmas there.[e 134]\n\n\n\n### Only in season 10[edit]\n\n\nMain section: § Introduced in season 10.
