She is the creator, writer, and star of the HBO television series *Girls* (2012–2017), for which she received several Emmy Award nominations and two Golden Globe Awards.[2][3] Dunham also directed several episodes of *Girls* and became the first woman to win the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Series.[4] Prior to *Girls*, Dunham wrote, directed, and starred in the semi-autobiographical independent film *Tiny Furniture* (2010), for which she won an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay.[5][6] Her second feature film, *Sharp Stick*, written and directed by Dunham, was released in 2022. Her third film, *Catherine Called Birdy*, had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2022. It was released in a limited release on September 23, 2022, by Amazon Studios, prior to streaming on Prime Video on October 7, 2022.\n\n\nIn 2013, Dunham was included in the annual *Time* 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[7] In 2014, Dunham released her first book, *Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's \"Learned\"*.[8] In 2015, along with *Girls* showrunner Jenni Konner, Dunham created the publication *Lenny Letter*, a feminist online newsletter.[9][10] The publication ran for three years before folding in late 2018.[11]\n\n\nDunham briefly appeared in films such as *Supporting Characters* and *This Is 40* (both 2012) and *Happy Christmas* (2014). She voiced Mary in the 2016 film *My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea*, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. On television, aside from *Girls*, she has played guest roles in *Scandal* and *The Simpsons* (both 2015). In 2017, she portrayed Valerie Solanas in *American Horror Story: Cult.*[12]\n\n\nDunham's work, as well as her outspoken presence on social media and in interviews, have attracted significant controversy, praise, criticism, and media scrutiny throughout her career.[13][14]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDunham was born in New York City.[15][16] Her father, Carroll Dunham, is a painter, and her mother, Laurie Simmons, is an artist and photographer, and a member of The Pictures Generation, known for her use of dolls and dollhouse furniture in her photographs of setup interior scenes.[17][18] Her father is Protestant of mostly English ancestry;[19] whereas her mother is Jewish.[20][21][22][23] Dunham has described herself as feeling \"very culturally Jewish, although that's the biggest cliché for a Jewish woman to say.\" The Modern Hebrew poetry of Yehuda Amichai helped her to connect with her Judaism.[24][25][26] The Dunham family are cousins of the Tiffany family, prominent in the jewelry trade.[27][28]\n\n\nDunham attended Friends Seminary before transferring in seventh grade to Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn, where she met *Tiny Furniture* actress and future *Girls* co-star Jemima Kirke.[29][30] As a teen, Dunham also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.[31] She attended The New School for a year before transferring to Oberlin College,[32][18] where she graduated in 2008 with a degree in creative writing.[18]\n\n\nShe has a younger sibling, Cyrus, a 2014 graduate of Brown University, who appeared in Dunham's first film, *Creative Nonfiction*, and starred in her second film, *Tiny Furniture*.[18][33] The siblings were raised in Brooklyn and spent summers in Salisbury, Connecticut.[34]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2000s: Oberlin College and early works[edit]\n\n\nWhile a student at Oberlin College, Dunham produced several independent short films and uploaded them to YouTube. Many of her early films dealt with themes of sexual enlightenment and were produced in a mumblecore filmmaking style, a dialog-heavy style in which young people talk about their personal relationships. In 2006, she produced *Pressure*, in which a girl and two friends talk about experiencing an orgasm for the first time, which makes Dunham's character feel pressured to do so as well.[35][36] \"I didn't go to film school\", Dunham explains. \"Instead I went to liberal arts school and self-imposed a curriculum of creating tiny flawed video sketches, brief meditations on comic conundrums, and slapping them on the Internet.\"[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Dunham on the set of her web series *Delusional Downtown Divas*Another early film, entitled *The Fountain*, which depicted her in a bikini brushing her teeth in the public fountain at Oberlin College, went viral on YouTube.[38][39] \"Her blithe willingness to disrobe without shame caused an outburst of censure from viewers,\" observed *The New Yorker*'s Rebecca Mead.[18] Dunham was shocked by the backlash and decided to take the video down:\n\n\n\n> There were just pages of YouTube comments about how fat I was, or how not fat I was,\" Dunham said. \"I didn't want you to Google me and the first thing you see is a debate about whether my breasts are misshapen.\"[18]\n> \n> \n\n\n*Pressures* (2006), *Open the Door* (2007), *Hooker on Campus* (2007), and *The Fountain* (2007) were released as DVD extras with *Tiny Furniture*.[40]\n\n\nIn 2007, Dunham starred in a ten-episode web series for Nerve.com entitled *Tight Shots*,[41][42] described by *The New York Times Magazine*'s Virginia Heffernan as \"a daffy serial about kids trying to make a movie and be artsy and have tons of sex.\"[43]\n\n\nIn 2009, Dunham created the *Index Magazine* web series, *Delusional Downtown Divas*, which satirized the New York City art scene. The production was unpaid, so Dunham and her friends \"pooled their money from babysitting and art-assistant gigs and borrowed some camera gear.\"[44]\n\n\nAlso in 2009, Dunham premiered *Creative Nonfiction*—a comedy where she plays Ella, a college student struggling to complete a screenplay[45]—at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. She was initially rejected by the festival the year before; she re-edited and successfully resubmitted the film.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2010–11: Breakthrough with *Tiny Furniture*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tiny Furniture\n\n![](image)Dunham speaking at the Maryland Film Festival in 2010Dunham had a career breakthrough with her semiautobiographic 2010 feature film *Tiny Furniture*; the film won Best Narrative Feature at South by Southwest Music and Media Conference, and subsequently screened at such festivals as Maryland Film Festival.[47] Dunham plays the lead role of Aura.[18] Laurie Simmons (Lena Dunham's real-life mother) plays Aura's mother, and Lena's real-life sibling Cyrus plays Aura's on-screen sibling. For her work on *Tiny Furniture*, Dunham also won an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay.[48]\n\n\nThe success of *Tiny Furniture* earned Dunham a blind script deal at HBO.[49] The network set Dunham up with veteran showrunner Jennifer Konner. Konner told Vulture's Jada Yuan that she got involved with Dunham because she was an obsessive *Tiny Furniture* fan:\n\n\n\n\n> I got a copy of *Tiny Furniture* from [HBO president] Sue Naegle. Actually, [*New Girl* creator] Liz Meriwether told me about it and said, 'Oh, there's this great movie. This girl, she's 23, she wrote, directed, and starred in it; she's in her underwear the whole time.' And I was like, 'I really don't want to see that.' And then she was like, 'Oh, trust me, it's great.' So Sue gave it to me just because she had it ... I used to, like, give out copies of the movie. But I'd just broken up with my writing partner and couldn't be less interested in the idea of supervising anybody. I really was like, 'I'm going to find my voice, and be on my own.' And then they called me and they were like, 'Oh, the *Tiny Furniture* girl is doing a show, do you want to supervise her?' And I was like, 'Yes! One million percent. Sign me up. Totally on board.'[50]\n> \n> \n\n\nDunham's star was also raised considerably when she was profiled by David Carr in *The New York Times*; he was later credited with introducing her to Judd Apatow.[51][52] Apatow watched *Tiny Furniture*, and was surprised Dunham had also written and directed the film. \"I emailed her and told her I thought it was great\", Apatow told *The Hollywood Reporter*. \"It turned out she was in the middle of negotiating a deal to develop a show for HBO and that her partner was Jenni Konner, whom I had worked with on *Undeclared* and a bunch of other projects. They asked me if I wanted to be a part of it, and I was thrilled to jump in.\"[53]\n\n\n\n### 2012–17: Mainstream success with *Girls* and first book[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Girls (TV series) and Not That Kind of Girl\n![](image)Dunham at the premiere of *Supporting Characters* at the 2012 Tribeca Film FestivalDunham's television series, *Girls*, was greenlit by HBO in early 2011.[54] Three episodes were screened to positive response at the 2012 South by Southwest Festival.[55]\n\n\nThe series follows Hannah Horvath (portrayed by Dunham), a 20-something writer struggling to get by in New York City. Some of the struggles facing Dunham's character Hannah—including being cut off financially from her parents, becoming a writer and making unfortunate decisions—are inspired by Dunham's real-life experiences.[56]\n\n\nDunham said *Girls* reflects a part of the population not portrayed in the 1998 HBO series *Sex and the City*. \"*Gossip Girl* was teens duking it out on the Upper East Side and *Sex and the City* was women who [had] figured out work and friends and now want to nail romance and family life. There was this 'hole-in-between' space that hadn't really been addressed,\" she said.[56] The pilot intentionally references *Sex and the City* as producers wanted to make it clear that the driving force behind *Girls* is that the characters were inspired by the former HBO series and moved to New York to pursue their dreams.[56] Dunham herself says she \"revere[s] that show just as much as any girl of my generation\".[56]\n\n\nThe first season premiered on HBO on April 15, 2012, and received critical acclaim. *The New York Times* applauded the series, writing that \"*Girls* may be the millennial generation's rebuttal to *Sex and the City*, but the first season was at times as cruelly insightful and bleakly funny as *Louie* on FX or *Curb Your Enthusiasm* on HBO.\"[57] James Poniewozik from *Time* reserved high praise for the series, calling it \"raw, audacious, nuanced and richly, often excruciatingly funny\".[58]\n\n\nDespite the acclaim, the series also generated significant criticism over its lack of racial representation and Dunham's frequent on-screen nudity.[59][60]\n\n\nThe first season garnered Dunham four Emmy Award nominations for her roles in acting, writing, and directing the series, as well as two Golden Globe Awards for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy and Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy.[61][62] In February 2013, Dunham became the first woman to win a Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Series for her work on *Girls*.[63]\n\n\n*Girls* was renewed for a second season in April 2012, before the first season had finished airing.[64] The finale episode of the first season drew over one million viewers.[65]\n\n\nThe second season of *Girls* continued to receive critical acclaim. David Wiegland of the *San Francisco Chronicle* said that \"The entire constellation of impetuous, ambitious, determined and insecure young urbanites in *Girls* is realigning in the new season, but at no point in the four episodes sent to critics for review do you feel that any of it is artificial\".[66] Verne Gay of *Newsday* said it is \"Sharper, smarter, more richly layered, detailed and acted\".[67] Ken Tucker of *Entertainment Weekly* felt that \"As bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as it was in its first season, *Girls* may now be even spunkier, funnier, and riskier\".[68] The second season ran on HBO from January 2013 to March 2013, with third and fourth seasons subsequently being renewed. The third season of *Girls* premiered in January 2014 with over one million viewers.[69] The following month, Dunham hosted an episode of *Saturday Night Live* with musical guest The National.[70]\n\n\nIn late 2012, Dunham signed a $3.5 million deal with Random House to publish her first book.[71] The book, an essay collection called *Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's \"Learned\"*, was published in September 2014.[72] It reached number two on *The New York Times Best Seller list* in October 2014.[73]\n\n\n\nOn January 5, 2015, days before the premiere of the fourth season, *Girls* was renewed for a fifth season,[74] despite dwindling viewership.[75] That year, Dunham launched A Casual Romance Productions, a production company to develop television and film projects.[76] The company produced *It's Me Hilary: The Man Who Drew Eloise*.[77] On February 20, 2015, it was reported that Dunham had been cast in a guest role in an episode of the ABC drama series *Scandal*, which aired March 19, 2015.[78] \n\n![](image)Dunham with Avy Kaufman at the 2016 Sundance Film FestivalIn September 2015, Dunham stated that the sixth season of *Girls* was likely to be the last season.[79] This was later confirmed by HBO.[80]\n\n\nIn 2016, Dunham appeared in her mother's film, *My Art*,[81] which had its world premiere at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival.[82] She also voiced Mary in *My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea*, a 2016 American animated teen comedy drama film directed by Dash Shaw.[83] It was selected to be screened in the Vanguard section at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.[84] Dunham also filmed scenes for the film *Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising*, but they were cut from the final film.\n\n\nIn 2017, she portrayed Valerie Solanas, the real-life radical feminist and *SCUM Manifesto* author who attempted to murder Andy Warhol in the late 1960s, in *American Horror Story: Cult.*[12]\n\n\n*Girls*' sixth and final season concluded on April 16, 2017, leaving a total of 62 episodes in the series.[85][86]\n\n\n\n### 2018–present: Second book, *Camping*, and other work[edit]\n\n\nSince 2016, Dunham has been working on a second book that will be published by Random House.[87]\n\n\nIn February 2018, A Casual Romance Productions announced that it would be producing *Camping*, a remake of the British comedy series of the same name for HBO, with Jennifer Garner in the lead and Dunham and Konner as showrunners and writers.[88][89] On July 25, 2018, the series held a panel at the Television Critics Association's annual summer press tour featuring executive producer Jenni Konner and cast member Jennifer Garner.[90] The following day, a teaser trailer for the series was released.[91]\n\n\n*Camping* has been met with a mixed to negative response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 28% approval rating, with an average rating of 5.1 out of 10 based on 32 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The first season of *Camping* makes it difficult to determine who the least happy campers are: those on the screen or those watching it.\"[92] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 49 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[93]\n\n\nIn August 2018, it was announced Dunham would appear in the film *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*, directed by Quentin Tarantino, which released on July 26, 2019.[94] Dunham portrayed the role of Catherine \"Gypsy\" Share.[95] In October 2018, coinciding with the expiration of their joint HBO contract, Dunham and Konner split as producing partners, dissolved their production company.[96] In August 2019, Dunham launched a new production company *Good Thing Going* which has a first look deal with HBO.[97]\n\n\nIn 2019, Lena Dunham and Alissa Bennett started a podcast called *The C-Word Podcast* produced by Luminary.[98]\n\n\nIn response to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, in March 2020 Dunham announced she would write a serialized novel, *Verified Strangers*, as a response to social isolation. She added that the act was a response to help herself and the readers in the time of anxiety.[99][100] The serialization started later that month on the *Vogue* website.[101] Dunham directed and served as an executive producer on the first episode of HBO's *Industry*.[102] That same year, she appeared in *The Stand In* directed by Jamie Babbit.[103]\n\n\nIn 2021, Dunham had a small role in *Music*, directed by Sia.[104] She also served as an executive producer on *Genera+ion*, a dramedy for HBO Max.[105]\n\n\nIn 2022, Dunham's second feature film, *Sharp Stick*, starring Kristine Froseth, Dunham, and Jon Bernthal, was released to mixed reviews. She also directed, wrote, and produced *Catherine Called Birdy*, an adaption of the children's novel of the same name by Karen Cushman for Working Title Films.[106][107]\n\n\n\n## In the media[edit]\n\n\nDunham has appeared on several magazine covers, including *Vogue*, *Elle*, *Marie Claire*, *Popular Mechanics*, and *Rolling Stone*. After Dunham posed with bare legs for *Glamour*'s February 2017 cover, she praised the magazine for featuring an unedited photo and leaving the cellulite on her thighs visible.[108][109]\n\n\n\n### *Lenny Letter*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lenny Letter\n\nIn 2015, Dunham, with Jenni Konner, co-founded *Lenny Letter*, a feminist online newsletter.[9][10] *Lenny Letter* was initially supported by Hearst Corporation advertising,[110] and subsequently by Condé Nast.[111] In addition to the regular newsletter, *Lenny Letter* published a Fiction Issue and a Poetry Issue during fall 2015.[112]\n\n\nNotable articles include an essay written by actress Jennifer Lawrence about the gender wage gap in Hollywood,[113] and one written by singer Alicia Keys about her decision to start wearing little to no make-up.[114]\n\n\nIn November 2017, following Dunham and Konner's controversial letter denouncing Aurora Perrineau's accusation of sexual assault by Murray Miller, Zinzi Clemmons announced that she would no longer contribute to the newsletter, saying Dunham's racism was \"well-known\" and called for all women of color to \"divest\" from Dunham.[115]\n\n\nIn October 2018, Dunham and Konner announced that *Lenny Letter* would be shutting down,[11][116] reportedly due to a decline in subscribers and failure to build momentum upon other platforms.[117]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nDunham's work and her outspoken presence on social media and in interviews have attracted significant controversy, criticism, and media scrutiny throughout her career.[13][14] On several occasions, Dunham has been accused of making racially insensitive remarks.[118][119][120]\n\n\nUpon release, *Girls* was met with criticism regarding the all-white main cast in the otherwise culturally diverse setting of New York City.[121][122] Though some pointed out that many white Americans are friends with other people of the same race, and adding a \"token\" African-American or Asian-American friend would be \"immature\" to reality.[123] Donald Glover guest starred as Sandy, a black Republican and Hannah's love interest, in the first two episodes of season two, which was criticized as tokenism in response to the initial backlash from the first season.[124]\n\n\nDunham spoke publicly about the criticism on several occasions; in an interview with IndieWire, she said:\n\n\n\n\n> I am a half-Jew, half-WASP, and I wrote two Jews and two WASPs. Something I wanted to avoid was tokenism in casting. If I had one of the four girls, if, for example, she was African-American, I feel like—not that the experience of an African-American girl and a white girl are drastically different, but there has to be specificity to that experience [that] I wasn't able to speak to. I really wrote the show from a gut-level place, and each character was a piece of me or based on someone close to me. And only later did I realize that it was four white girls. As much as I can say it was an accident, it was only later as the criticism came out, I thought, 'I hear this and I want to respond to it.' And this is a hard issue to speak to because all I want to do is sound sensitive and not say anything that will horrify anyone or make them feel more isolated, but I did write something that was super-specific to my experience, and I always want to avoid rendering an experience I can't speak to accurately.[125]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn her book *Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's \"Learned\"*, Dunham wrote about being sexually assaulted by an Oberlin College classmate, which resulted in controversy regarding the accuracy of her account and a case of mistaken identity when a former Oberlin College student named Barry (the pseudonym used for Dunham's alleged attacker in her book) sought legal advice to ensure people did not associate him with the content.[126][127][128] In the book, Dunham describes \"Barry\" as a man who wore cowboy boots, sported a mustache, hosted a radio show, worked at a campus library, and graduated from Oberlin in 2005; this description was characterized by the attorney of Dunham's former classmate, Aaron Minc, as detailed enough to point towards his client. Dunham later apologized for the confusion and Random House reprinted the book with a disclaimer, releasing a statement saying: \"Random House, on our own behalf and on behalf of our author, regrets the confusion.\"[129]\n\n\nOther passages in the book recounting interactions of a sexual nature, starting when she was seven years old - with her then one-year-old sibling Cyrus - also attracted significant controversy,[130] and prompted numerous editorials about children's sexuality and personal boundaries.[131][132][133]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Dunham criticized NFL player Odell Beckham Jr. for his interactions with her at the Met Gala. Dunham said, \"I was sitting next to Odell Beckham Jr., and it was so amazing because it was like he looked at me and he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards. He was like, 'That's a marshmallow. That's a child. That's a dog.' It wasn't mean — he just seemed confused. The vibe was very much like, 'Do I want to f--- it? Is it wearing a ... yep, it's wearing a tuxedo. I'm going to go back to my cell phone.\" She added, \"It was like we were forced to be together, and he literally was scrolling Instagram rather than have to look at a woman in a bow tie. I was like, 'This should be called the Metropolitan Museum of Getting Rejected by Athletes'.\"[134] Dunham was criticized for her comments, which some considered to be an example of \"white entitlement\".[135][136] She later apologized for her characterization of his interactions and thoughts.[137]\n\n\nIn December 2016, Dunham declared on a podcast that she wished she had had an abortion, explaining that she wanted to better understand women who have. The comment was widely condemned as insensitive.[138][139] Dunham later issued a lengthy apology on her Instagram.[140][141]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Dunham defended *Girls* writer Murray Miller, whom actress Aurora Perrineau had accused of sexually assaulting her in 2012 when she was seventeen. Dunham responded to the accusations by saying, \"While our first instinct is to listen to every woman's story, our insider knowledge of Murray's situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3% of assault cases that are misreported every year.\"[142] After an immediate backlash, Dunham apologized for that statement, saying that it was \"absolutely the wrong time to come forward with such a statement\" and that \"every woman who comes forward deserves to be heard, fully and completely, and our relationship to the accused should not be part of the calculation anyone makes when examining her case.\"[142] Dunham was described as a \"hipster racist\" for her defense of Miller, as Perrineau is of mixed race.[143][144] In December 2018, Dunham stated that, contrary to her previous statement, she had no \"insider information\" that exonerated Murray.[145][146][147]\n\n\nIn October 2018, Dunham was hired to write the screenplay for an untitled film based upon the memoir *A Hope More Powerful Than the Sea: One Refugee's Incredible Story of Love, Loss, and Survival*, by Melissa Fleming, which follows the true story of Doaa Al Zamel, who fled Egypt for Europe and became one of few survivors of a shipwrecked refugee boat, surviving days in open water and supporting herself and two orphaned children with only an inflatable water ring.[148] Steven Spielberg and J. J. Abrams are set to produce the film.[149] Dunham's hiring received backlash from those who felt that, instead of Dunham, a Syrian woman should have been hired.[150][151][152] Daniel Medina, a journalist, wrote: \"Lena Dunham constantly talks about representation as crucial to enrich storytelling. Yet, in practice, she has shown a disregard for actually elevating those voices. Now, she's been signed on to write a Syrian refugee's story?\".[153] Author Alia Malek stated: \"The idea that Lena Dunham is better situated to tell the story of a Syrian than somebody else implicit in that is a kind of hierarchy.\"[154]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Dunham began dating Jack Antonoff, the lead guitarist of the band fun. and the founder of Bleachers.[155][156] Dunham and Antonoff remained together until December 2017; they subsequently separated announcing that the separation was \"amicable\".[157][158]\n\n\nDunham was diagnosed with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) as a child, and continued to take a low dose of an anxiolytic (Klonopin) to relieve her anxiety until 2018.[159][160] In 2018 Dunham entered rehab for benzodiazpines addiction.[161] In April 2020, she celebrated two years of sobriety.[162][163][164]\n\n\nIn February 2018, Dunham wrote an essay for *Vogue* about her decision to have a hysterectomy due to endometriosis.[165]\n\n\nIn 2019, Dunham revealed that she has Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS).[166]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Dunham reported on Instagram her experience with COVID-19 because she observed people were not taking social distancing seriously. Though she was not hospitalized, she did have \"severe symptoms for three weeks\".[167]\n\n\nAfter a mutual friend set them up on a blind date, Dunham began dating English-Peruvian musician Luis Felber, in January 2021.[168][169][170] In September 2021, Dunham and Felber married in a Jewish ceremony at the Union Club in Soho.[170][169]\n\n\n\n## Political activities[edit]\n\n\nDunham supports gun control,[171] immigrant rights,[172] and gay rights.[173]\n\n\nIn fall of 2012, Dunham appeared in a video advertisement promoting President Barack Obama's re-election, delivering a monologue, which, according to a blog quoted in *The Atlantic*, tried to \"get the youth vote by comparing voting for the first time to having sex for the first time\".[174] Fox News reported criticism from conservatives such as Media Research Center's Lauren Thompson, public relations professional Ronn Torossian, and media trainer Louise Pennell, who labeled the advertisement as tasteless, inappropriate, and a ploy to lure the younger female vote.[175] It included a comment from Steve Hall of Ad Rants saying that \"not everyone was so offended.\" A friend of Dunham said the actress was not paid for her performance on the spot, and Dunham defended the ad by tweeting \"The video may be light but the message is serious: vote for women's rights.\" In *The Nation,* Ari Melber wrote \"the ad's style is vintage Lena: edgy and informed, controversial but achingly self-aware, sexually proud and affirmatively feminist.\"[176]\n\n\nIn 2014, Dunham was named the Recipient of Horizon Award 2014 by Point Foundation for her support of the gay community.[177]\n\n\nIn April 2016, she wrote in support of Hillary Clinton, pledging to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, if Donald Trump won the election.[178][179] Dunham rebuked Trump for the Access Hollywood tape.[180]\n\n\nAfter Trump's win, Dunham wrote she will not be moving to Canada, saying, \"I can survive staying in this country, MY country, to fight and love and use my embarrassment of blessings to do what's right.\"[181]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Dunham endorsed Jim Johnson, a Democratic New Jersey gubernatorial candidate.[182] Later that month, Dunham endorsed Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, in the United Kingdom general election.[183]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFilm work\n| Year\n |

She is the creator, writer, and star of the HBO television series *Girls* (2012–2017), for which she received several Emmy Award nominations and two Golden Globe Awards.[2][3] Dunham also directed several episodes of *Girls* and became the first woman to win the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Series.[4] Prior to *Girls*, Dunham wrote, directed, and starred in the semi-autobiographical independent film *Tiny Furniture* (2010), for which she won an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay.[5][6] Her second feature film, *Sharp Stick*, written and directed by Dunham, was released in 2022. Her third film, *Catherine Called Birdy*, had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2022. It was released in a limited release on September 23, 2022, by Amazon Studios, prior to streaming on Prime Video on October 7, 2022.\n\n\nIn 2013, Dunham was included in the annual *Time* 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[7] In 2014, Dunham released her first book, *Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's \"Learned\"*.[8] In 2015, along with *Girls* showrunner Jenni Konner, Dunham created the publication *Lenny Letter*, a feminist online newsletter.[9][10] The publication ran for three years before folding in late 2018.[11]\n\n\nDunham briefly appeared in films such as *Supporting Characters* and *This Is 40* (both 2012) and *Happy Christmas* (2014). She voiced Mary in the 2016 film *My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea*, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. On television, aside from *Girls*, she has played guest roles in *Scandal* and *The Simpsons* (both 2015). In 2017, she portrayed Valerie Solanas in *American Horror Story: Cult.*[12]\n\n\nDunham's work, as well as her outspoken presence on social media and in interviews, have attracted significant controversy, praise, criticism, and media scrutiny throughout her career.[13][14]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDunham was born in New York City.[15][16] Her father, Carroll Dunham, is a painter, and her mother, Laurie Simmons, is an artist and photographer, and a member of The Pictures Generation, known for her use of dolls and dollhouse furniture in her photographs of setup interior scenes.[17][18] Her father is Protestant of mostly English ancestry;[19] whereas her mother is Jewish.[20][21][22][23] Dunham has described herself as feeling \"very culturally Jewish, although that's the biggest cliché for a Jewish woman to say.\" The Modern Hebrew poetry of Yehuda Amichai helped her to connect with her Judaism.[24][25][26] The Dunham family are cousins of the Tiffany family, prominent in the jewelry trade.[27][28]\n\n\nDunham attended Friends Seminary before transferring in seventh grade to Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn, where she met *Tiny Furniture* actress and future *Girls* co-star Jemima Kirke.[29][30] As a teen, Dunham also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.[31] She attended The New School for a year before transferring to Oberlin College,[32][18] where she graduated in 2008 with a degree in creative writing.[18]\n\n\nShe has a younger sibling, Cyrus, a 2014 graduate of Brown University, who appeared in Dunham's first film, *Creative Nonfiction*, and starred in her second film, *Tiny Furniture*.[18][33] The siblings were raised in Brooklyn and spent summers in Salisbury, Connecticut.[34]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2000s: Oberlin College and early works[edit]\n\n\nWhile a student at Oberlin College, Dunham produced several independent short films and uploaded them to YouTube. Many of her early films dealt with themes of sexual enlightenment and were produced in a mumblecore filmmaking style, a dialog-heavy style in which young people talk about their personal relationships. In 2006, she produced *Pressure*, in which a girl and two friends talk about experiencing an orgasm for the first time, which makes Dunham's character feel pressured to do so as well.[35][36] \"I didn't go to film school\", Dunham explains. \"Instead I went to liberal arts school and self-imposed a curriculum of creating tiny flawed video sketches, brief meditations on comic conundrums, and slapping them on the Internet.\"[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Dunham on the set of her web series *Delusional Downtown Divas*Another early film, entitled *The Fountain*, which depicted her in a bikini brushing her teeth in the public fountain at Oberlin College, went viral on YouTube.[38][39] \"Her blithe willingness to disrobe without shame caused an outburst of censure from viewers,\" observed *The New Yorker*'s Rebecca Mead.[18] Dunham was shocked by the backlash and decided to take the video down:\n\n\n\n> There were just pages of YouTube comments about how fat I was, or how not fat I was,\" Dunham said. \"I didn't want you to Google me and the first thing you see is a debate about whether my breasts are misshapen.\"[18]\n> \n> \n\n\n*Pressures* (2006), *Open the Door* (2007), *Hooker on Campus* (2007), and *The Fountain* (2007) were released as DVD extras with *Tiny Furniture*.[40]\n\n\nIn 2007, Dunham starred in a ten-episode web series for Nerve.com entitled *Tight Shots*,[41][42] described by *The New York Times Magazine*'s Virginia Heffernan as \"a daffy serial about kids trying to make a movie and be artsy and have tons of sex.\"[43]\n\n\nIn 2009, Dunham created the *Index Magazine* web series, *Delusional Downtown Divas*, which satirized the New York City art scene. The production was unpaid, so Dunham and her friends \"pooled their money from babysitting and art-assistant gigs and borrowed some camera gear.\"[44]\n\n\nAlso in 2009, Dunham premiered *Creative Nonfiction*—a comedy where she plays Ella, a college student struggling to complete a screenplay[45]—at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. She was initially rejected by the festival the year before; she re-edited and successfully resubmitted the film.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2010–11: Breakthrough with *Tiny Furniture*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tiny Furniture\n\n![](image)Dunham speaking at the Maryland Film Festival in 2010Dunham had a career breakthrough with her semiautobiographic 2010 feature film *Tiny Furniture*; the film won Best Narrative Feature at South by Southwest Music and Media Conference, and subsequently screened at such festivals as Maryland Film Festival.[47] Dunham plays the lead role of Aura.[18] Laurie Simmons (Lena Dunham's real-life mother) plays Aura's mother, and Lena's real-life sibling Cyrus plays Aura's on-screen sibling. For her work on *Tiny Furniture*, Dunham also won an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay.[48]\n\n\nThe success of *Tiny Furniture* earned Dunham a blind script deal at HBO.[49] The network set Dunham up with veteran showrunner Jennifer Konner. Konner told Vulture's Jada Yuan that she got involved with Dunham because she was an obsessive *Tiny Furniture* fan:\n\n\n\n\n> I got a copy of *Tiny Furniture* from [HBO president] Sue Naegle. Actually, [*New Girl* creator] Liz Meriwether told me about it and said, 'Oh, there's this great movie. This girl, she's 23, she wrote, directed, and starred in it; she's in her underwear the whole time.' And I was like, 'I really don't want to see that.' And then she was like, 'Oh, trust me, it's great.' So Sue gave it to me just because she had it ... I used to, like, give out copies of the movie. But I'd just broken up with my writing partner and couldn't be less interested in the idea of supervising anybody. I really was like, 'I'm going to find my voice, and be on my own.' And then they called me and they were like, 'Oh, the *Tiny Furniture* girl is doing a show, do you want to supervise her?' And I was like, 'Yes! One million percent. Sign me up. Totally on board.'[50]\n> \n> \n\n\nDunham's star was also raised considerably when she was profiled by David Carr in *The New York Times*; he was later credited with introducing her to Judd Apatow.[51][52] Apatow watched *Tiny Furniture*, and was surprised Dunham had also written and directed the film. \"I emailed her and told her I thought it was great\", Apatow told *The Hollywood Reporter*. \"It turned out she was in the middle of negotiating a deal to develop a show for HBO and that her partner was Jenni Konner, whom I had worked with on *Undeclared* and a bunch of other projects. They asked me if I wanted to be a part of it, and I was thrilled to jump in.\"[53]\n\n\n\n### 2012–17: Mainstream success with *Girls* and first book[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Girls (TV series) and Not That Kind of Girl\n![](image)Dunham at the premiere of *Supporting Characters* at the 2012 Tribeca Film FestivalDunham's television series, *Girls*, was greenlit by HBO in early 2011.[54] Three episodes were screened to positive response at the 2012 South by Southwest Festival.[55]\n\n\nThe series follows Hannah Horvath (portrayed by Dunham), a 20-something writer struggling to get by in New York City. Some of the struggles facing Dunham's character Hannah—including being cut off financially from her parents, becoming a writer and making unfortunate decisions—are inspired by Dunham's real-life experiences.[56]\n\n\nDunham said *Girls* reflects a part of the population not portrayed in the 1998 HBO series *Sex and the City*. \"*Gossip Girl* was teens duking it out on the Upper East Side and *Sex and the City* was women who [had] figured out work and friends and now want to nail romance and family life. There was this 'hole-in-between' space that hadn't really been addressed,\" she said.[56] The pilot intentionally references *Sex and the City* as producers wanted to make it clear that the driving force behind *Girls* is that the characters were inspired by the former HBO series and moved to New York to pursue their dreams.[56] Dunham herself says she \"revere[s] that show just as much as any girl of my generation\".[56]\n\n\nThe first season premiered on HBO on April 15, 2012, and received critical acclaim. *The New York Times* applauded the series, writing that \"*Girls* may be the millennial generation's rebuttal to *Sex and the City*, but the first season was at times as cruelly insightful and bleakly funny as *Louie* on FX or *Curb Your Enthusiasm* on HBO.\"[57] James Poniewozik from *Time* reserved high praise for the series, calling it \"raw, audacious, nuanced and richly, often excruciatingly funny\".[58]\n\n\nDespite the acclaim, the series also generated significant criticism over its lack of racial representation and Dunham's frequent on-screen nudity.[59][60]\n\n\nThe first season garnered Dunham four Emmy Award nominations for her roles in acting, writing, and directing the series, as well as two Golden Globe Awards for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy and Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy.[61][62] In February 2013, Dunham became the first woman to win a Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Series for her work on *Girls*.[63]\n\n\n*Girls* was renewed for a second season in April 2012, before the first season had finished airing.[64] The finale episode of the first season drew over one million viewers.[65]\n\n\nThe second season of *Girls* continued to receive critical acclaim. David Wiegland of the *San Francisco Chronicle* said that \"The entire constellation of impetuous, ambitious, determined and insecure young urbanites in *Girls* is realigning in the new season, but at no point in the four episodes sent to critics for review do you feel that any of it is artificial\".[66] Verne Gay of *Newsday* said it is \"Sharper, smarter, more richly layered, detailed and acted\".[67] Ken Tucker of *Entertainment Weekly* felt that \"As bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as it was in its first season, *Girls* may now be even spunkier, funnier, and riskier\".[68] The second season ran on HBO from January 2013 to March 2013, with third and fourth seasons subsequently being renewed. The third season of *Girls* premiered in January 2014 with over one million viewers.[69] The following month, Dunham hosted an episode of *Saturday Night Live* with musical guest The National.[70]\n\n\nIn late 2012, Dunham signed a $3.5 million deal with Random House to publish her first book.[71] The book, an essay collection called *Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's \"Learned\"*, was published in September 2014.[72] It reached number two on *The New York Times Best Seller list* in October 2014.[73]\n\n\n\nOn January 5, 2015, days before the premiere of the fourth season, *Girls* was renewed for a fifth season,[74] despite dwindling viewership.[75] That year, Dunham launched A Casual Romance Productions, a production company to develop television and film projects.[76] The company produced *It's Me Hilary: The Man Who Drew Eloise*.[77] On February 20, 2015, it was reported that Dunham had been cast in a guest role in an episode of the ABC drama series *Scandal*, which aired March 19, 2015.[78] \n\n![](image)Dunham with Avy Kaufman at the 2016 Sundance Film FestivalIn September 2015, Dunham stated that the sixth season of *Girls* was likely to be the last season.[79] This was later confirmed by HBO.[80]\n\n\nIn 2016, Dunham appeared in her mother's film, *My Art*,[81] which had its world premiere at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival.[82] She also voiced Mary in *My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea*, a 2016 American animated teen comedy drama film directed by Dash Shaw.[83] It was selected to be screened in the Vanguard section at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.[84] Dunham also filmed scenes for the film *Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising*, but they were cut from the final film.\n\n\nIn 2017, she portrayed Valerie Solanas, the real-life radical feminist and *SCUM Manifesto* author who attempted to murder Andy Warhol in the late 1960s, in *American Horror Story: Cult.*[12]\n\n\n*Girls*' sixth and final season concluded on April 16, 2017, leaving a total of 62 episodes in the series.[85][86]\n\n\n\n### 2018–present: Second book, *Camping*, and other work[edit]\n\n\nSince 2016, Dunham has been working on a second book that will be published by Random House.[87]\n\n\nIn February 2018, A Casual Romance Productions announced that it would be producing *Camping*, a remake of the British comedy series of the same name for HBO, with Jennifer Garner in the lead and Dunham and Konner as showrunners and writers.[88][89] On July 25, 2018, the series held a panel at the Television Critics Association's annual summer press tour featuring executive producer Jenni Konner and cast member Jennifer Garner.[90] The following day, a teaser trailer for the series was released.[91]\n\n\n*Camping* has been met with a mixed to negative response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 28% approval rating, with an average rating of 5.1 out of 10 based on 32 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The first season of *Camping* makes it difficult to determine who the least happy campers are: those on the screen or those watching it.\"[92] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 49 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[93]\n\n\nIn August 2018, it was announced Dunham would appear in the film *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*, directed by Quentin Tarantino, which released on July 26, 2019.[94] Dunham portrayed the role of Catherine \"Gypsy\" Share.[95] In October 2018, coinciding with the expiration of their joint HBO contract, Dunham and Konner split as producing partners, dissolved their production company.[96] In August 2019, Dunham launched a new production company *Good Thing Going* which has a first look deal with HBO.[97]\n\n\nIn 2019, Lena Dunham and Alissa Bennett started a podcast called *The C-Word Podcast* produced by Luminary.[98]\n\n\nIn response to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, in March 2020 Dunham announced she would write a serialized novel, *Verified Strangers*, as a response to social isolation. She added that the act was a response to help herself and the readers in the time of anxiety.[99][100] The serialization started later that month on the *Vogue* website.[101] Dunham directed and served as an executive producer on the first episode of HBO's *Industry*.[102] That same year, she appeared in *The Stand In* directed by Jamie Babbit.[103]\n\n\nIn 2021, Dunham had a small role in *Music*, directed by Sia.[104] She also served as an executive producer on *Genera+ion*, a dramedy for HBO Max.[105]\n\n\nIn 2022, Dunham's second feature film, *Sharp Stick*, starring Kristine Froseth, Dunham, and Jon Bernthal, was released to mixed reviews. She also directed, wrote, and produced *Catherine Called Birdy*, an adaption of the children's novel of the same name by Karen Cushman for Working Title Films.[106][107]\n\n\n\n## In the media[edit]\n\n\nDunham has appeared on several magazine covers, including *Vogue*, *Elle*, *Marie Claire*, *Popular Mechanics*, and *Rolling Stone*. After Dunham posed with bare legs for *Glamour*'s February 2017 cover, she praised the magazine for featuring an unedited photo and leaving the cellulite on her thighs visible.[108][109]\n\n\n\n### *Lenny Letter*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lenny Letter\n\nIn 2015, Dunham, with Jenni Konner, co-founded *Lenny Letter*, a feminist online newsletter.[9][10] *Lenny Letter* was initially supported by Hearst Corporation advertising,[110] and subsequently by Condé Nast.[111] In addition to the regular newsletter, *Lenny Letter* published a Fiction Issue and a Poetry Issue during fall 2015.[112]\n\n\nNotable articles include an essay written by actress Jennifer Lawrence about the gender wage gap in Hollywood,[113] and one written by singer Alicia Keys about her decision to start wearing little to no make-up.[114]\n\n\nIn November 2017, following Dunham and Konner's controversial letter denouncing Aurora Perrineau's accusation of sexual assault by Murray Miller, Zinzi Clemmons announced that she would no longer contribute to the newsletter, saying Dunham's racism was \"well-known\" and called for all women of color to \"divest\" from Dunham.[115]\n\n\nIn October 2018, Dunham and Konner announced that *Lenny Letter* would be shutting down,[11][116] reportedly due to a decline in subscribers and failure to build momentum upon other platforms.[117]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nDunham's work and her outspoken presence on social media and in interviews have attracted significant controversy, criticism, and media scrutiny throughout her career.[13][14] On several occasions, Dunham has been accused of making racially insensitive remarks.[118][119][120]\n\n\nUpon release, *Girls* was met with criticism regarding the all-white main cast in the otherwise culturally diverse setting of New York City.[121][122] Though some pointed out that many white Americans are friends with other people of the same race, and adding a \"token\" African-American or Asian-American friend would be \"immature\" to reality.[123] Donald Glover guest starred as Sandy, a black Republican and Hannah's love interest, in the first two episodes of season two, which was criticized as tokenism in response to the initial backlash from the first season.[124]\n\n\nDunham spoke publicly about the criticism on several occasions; in an interview with IndieWire, she said:\n\n\n\n\n> I am a half-Jew, half-WASP, and I wrote two Jews and two WASPs. Something I wanted to avoid was tokenism in casting. If I had one of the four girls, if, for example, she was African-American, I feel like—not that the experience of an African-American girl and a white girl are drastically different, but there has to be specificity to that experience [that] I wasn't able to speak to. I really wrote the show from a gut-level place, and each character was a piece of me or based on someone close to me. And only later did I realize that it was four white girls. As much as I can say it was an accident, it was only later as the criticism came out, I thought, 'I hear this and I want to respond to it.' And this is a hard issue to speak to because all I want to do is sound sensitive and not say anything that will horrify anyone or make them feel more isolated, but I did write something that was super-specific to my experience, and I always want to avoid rendering an experience I can't speak to accurately.[125]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn her book *Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's \"Learned\"*, Dunham wrote about being sexually assaulted by an Oberlin College classmate, which resulted in controversy regarding the accuracy of her account and a case of mistaken identity when a former Oberlin College student named Barry (the pseudonym used for Dunham's alleged attacker in her book) sought legal advice to ensure people did not associate him with the content.[126][127][128] In the book, Dunham describes \"Barry\" as a man who wore cowboy boots, sported a mustache, hosted a radio show, worked at a campus library, and graduated from Oberlin in 2005; this description was characterized by the attorney of Dunham's former classmate, Aaron Minc, as detailed enough to point towards his client. Dunham later apologized for the confusion and Random House reprinted the book with a disclaimer, releasing a statement saying: \"Random House, on our own behalf and on behalf of our author, regrets the confusion.\"[129]\n\n\nOther passages in the book recounting interactions of a sexual nature, starting when she was seven years old - with her then one-year-old sibling Cyrus - also attracted significant controversy,[130] and prompted numerous editorials about children's sexuality and personal boundaries.[131][132][133]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Dunham criticized NFL player Odell Beckham Jr. for his interactions with her at the Met Gala. Dunham said, \"I was sitting next to Odell Beckham Jr., and it was so amazing because it was like he looked at me and he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards. He was like, 'That's a marshmallow. That's a child. That's a dog.' It wasn't mean — he just seemed confused. The vibe was very much like, 'Do I want to f--- it? Is it wearing a ... yep, it's wearing a tuxedo. I'm going to go back to my cell phone.\" She added, \"It was like we were forced to be together, and he literally was scrolling Instagram rather than have to look at a woman in a bow tie. I was like, 'This should be called the Metropolitan Museum of Getting Rejected by Athletes'.\"[134] Dunham was criticized for her comments, which some considered to be an example of \"white entitlement\".[135][136] She later apologized for her characterization of his interactions and thoughts.[137]\n\n\nIn December 2016, Dunham declared on a podcast that she wished she had had an abortion, explaining that she wanted to better understand women who have. The comment was widely condemned as insensitive.[138][139] Dunham later issued a lengthy apology on her Instagram.[140][141]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Dunham defended *Girls* writer Murray Miller, whom actress Aurora Perrineau had accused of sexually assaulting her in 2012 when she was seventeen. Dunham responded to the accusations by saying, \"While our first instinct is to listen to every woman's story, our insider knowledge of Murray's situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3% of assault cases that are misreported every year.\"[142] After an immediate backlash, Dunham apologized for that statement, saying that it was \"absolutely the wrong time to come forward with such a statement\" and that \"every woman who comes forward deserves to be heard, fully and completely, and our relationship to the accused should not be part of the calculation anyone makes when examining her case.\"[142] Dunham was described as a \"hipster racist\" for her defense of Miller, as Perrineau is of mixed race.[143][144] In December 2018, Dunham stated that, contrary to her previous statement, she had no \"insider information\" that exonerated Murray.[145][146][147]\n\n\nIn October 2018, Dunham was hired to write the screenplay for an untitled film based upon the memoir *A Hope More Powerful Than the Sea: One Refugee's Incredible Story of Love, Loss, and Survival*, by Melissa Fleming, which follows the true story of Doaa Al Zamel, who fled Egypt for Europe and became one of few survivors of a shipwrecked refugee boat, surviving days in open water and supporting herself and two orphaned children with only an inflatable water ring.[148] Steven Spielberg and J. J. Abrams are set to produce the film.[149] Dunham's hiring received backlash from those who felt that, instead of Dunham, a Syrian woman should have been hired.[150][151][152] Daniel Medina, a journalist, wrote: \"Lena Dunham constantly talks about representation as crucial to enrich storytelling. Yet, in practice, she has shown a disregard for actually elevating those voices. Now, she's been signed on to write a Syrian refugee's story?\".[153] Author Alia Malek stated: \"The idea that Lena Dunham is better situated to tell the story of a Syrian than somebody else implicit in that is a kind of hierarchy.\"[154]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Dunham began dating Jack Antonoff, the lead guitarist of the band fun. and the founder of Bleachers.[155][156] Dunham and Antonoff remained together until December 2017; they subsequently separated announcing that the separation was \"amicable\".[157][158]\n\n\nDunham was diagnosed with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) as a child, and continued to take a low dose of an anxiolytic (Klonopin) to relieve her anxiety until 2018.[159][160] In 2018 Dunham entered rehab for benzodiazpines addiction.[161] In April 2020, she celebrated two years of sobriety.[162][163][164]\n\n\nIn February 2018, Dunham wrote an essay for *Vogue* about her decision to have a hysterectomy due to endometriosis.[165]\n\n\nIn 2019, Dunham revealed that she has Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS).[166]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Dunham reported on Instagram her experience with COVID-19 because she observed people were not taking social distancing seriously. Though she was not hospitalized, she did have \"severe symptoms for three weeks\".[167]\n\n\nAfter a mutual friend set them up on a blind date, Dunham began dating English-Peruvian musician Luis Felber, in January 2021.[168][169][170] In September 2021, Dunham and Felber married in a Jewish ceremony at the Union Club in Soho.[170][169]\n\n\n\n## Political activities[edit]\n\n\nDunham supports gun control,[171] immigrant rights,[172] and gay rights.[173]\n\n\nIn fall of 2012, Dunham appeared in a video advertisement promoting President Barack Obama's re-election, delivering a monologue, which, according to a blog quoted in *The Atlantic*, tried to \"get the youth vote by comparing voting for the first time to having sex for the first time\".[174] Fox News reported criticism from conservatives such as Media Research Center's Lauren Thompson, public relations professional Ronn Torossian, and media trainer Louise Pennell, who labeled the advertisement as tasteless, inappropriate, and a ploy to lure the younger female vote.[175] It included a comment from Steve Hall of Ad Rants saying that \"not everyone was so offended.\" A friend of Dunham said the actress was not paid for her performance on the spot, and Dunham defended the ad by tweeting \"The video may be light but the message is serious: vote for women's rights.\" In *The Nation,* Ari Melber wrote \"the ad's style is vintage Lena: edgy and informed, controversial but achingly self-aware, sexually proud and affirmatively feminist.\"[176]\n\n\nIn 2014, Dunham was named the Recipient of Horizon Award 2014 by Point Foundation for her support of the gay community.[177]\n\n\nIn April 2016, she wrote in support of Hillary Clinton, pledging to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, if Donald Trump won the election.[178][179] Dunham rebuked Trump for the Access Hollywood tape.[180]\n\n\nAfter Trump's win, Dunham wrote she will not be moving to Canada, saying, \"I can survive staying in this country, MY country, to fight and love and use my embarrassment of blessings to do what's right.\"[181]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Dunham endorsed Jim Johnson, a Democratic New Jersey gubernatorial candidate.[182] Later that month, Dunham endorsed Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, in the United Kingdom general election.[183]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFilm work\n| Year\n |

In 2017, she starred in Zayn's music video for the single \"Dusk Till Dawn\" featuring Sia.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and family[edit]\n\n\nBorn in London on 26 April 1985,[3] Kirke was raised in New York City.[4] She is the daughter of Simon Kirke, the former drummer of the rock bands Bad Company and Free.[5] Her mother is Lorraine Kirke (née Dellal), the owner of Geminola, a vintage boutique in New York City that supplied a number of outfits for the television series *Sex and the City*.[6] Her character Jessa wore a wedding dress from Geminola in the season finale of the first season of *Girls*; also, earlier in her career, she was featured along with her sisters in a fashion piece in *Teen Vogue* in which they wore clothing from the store.[7]\n\n\nHer father is of English and Scottish descent (the Kirkes being a junior branch of a family of Nottinghamshire landed gentry and descending also from the Gibson-Craig baronets)[8][9] and her mother is Jewish.[10] Kirke's maternal grandfather, Jack Dellal, was a British businessman of Iraqi-Jewish descent and her maternal grandmother, Zehava Helmer, was an Israeli flight attendant.[11][12][13] Kirke has two sisters, actress Lola Kirke and singer and actress Domino Kirke.[14][15][16] She is a cousin of curator Alexander Dellal,[17] shoe designer Charlotte Olympia Dellal and model/photographer Alice Dellal.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kirke's DJ set for sister Lola's VIP 2023 event in Manhattan.\n## Fine art[edit]\n\n\nKirke majored in art as a student and received her Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2008.[18] In late 2011, she held an exhibition titled \"A Brief History\" through Skylight Projects.[19] In late 2017 to early 2018 she had a show at Sargeant's Daughters, a Lower East Side gallery,[20] where she exhibited portrait-style paintings, some of them neck-up, others full-figure, of women in their wedding dresses. Kirke was inspired by her own divorce and the exhibition also contained a self-portrait of Kirke in her wedding dress and veil.[21][22]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Kirke presented for Batsheva Hay's spring collection at Ben's Kosher Deli.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jemima Kirke reading poetry at Church Street Boxing Gym in New York City.\n## Acting[edit]\n\n\nGrowing up in West Village, Kirke found herself accepting a number of roles on her friends' projects. Dunham asked Kirke to take on a supporting role in her debut film *Tiny Furniture*. Kirke and a number of other friends were called upon as a favour to Dunham since there was not enough money to pay professional actors.[*citation needed*] Although the film turned out to be profitable, Kirke received no payment.[24] Kirke reunited with Dunham in the HBO series *Girls*, appearing in all six seasons from 2011 to 2017 as the character Jessa Johansson. Kirke next had supporting roles in the dark comedy films *Ava's Possessions* and *The Little Hours*. In 2018, Kirke starred alongside her real-life sister Lola Kirke in Emma Forrest's film *Untogether*. The film premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival.[25]\n\n\nIn 2011, Kirke appeared in the music video \"Wring It Out\" for the group Rival Schools.[26] Both this music video and *Smile for the Camera* were directed by her friend Jordan Galland. In 2017, she appeared in the music video for \"Gotta Get a Grip\" by Mick Jagger, directed by Saam Farahmand and appeared opposite Alex Cameron in his music video for the song \"Stranger's Kiss\". In September 2017, Kirke appeared opposite Zayn Malik in his music video for the song \"Dusk Till Dawn\".\n\n\nIn 2021, Kirke appeared in the Netflix series *Sex Education* in the role of Hope, headmistress of Moordale Secondary School. In 2021, it was announced that Kirke had accepted a role in *Conversations with Friends*, a series based on the book of the same name by Sally Rooney, in which she plays Melissa, an older, experienced writer fascinated by a younger couple.[27][28] In 2023, Kirke starred in the Apple TV+ series City on Fire, based on the book of the same name.[29]\n\n\n\n## Directing[edit]\n\n\nKirke's directorial debut was in 2019 when she spearheaded the video for the track \"Mama\" by her sister Lola Kirke.[30] She would go onto direct other projects including multiple music videos and a satire short film with Alex Cameron.[31]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, Kirke partnered with the Center for Reproductive Rights to create a public service announcement to advance the future of reproductive healthcare.[32] In the PSA, Kirke discusses the abortion she received in college where she could not afford the anesthesia in addition to the procedure and went without.[32][33]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKirke resides in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn[34] and East Hampton. She married lawyer Michael Mosberg in 2009 and they have two children.[35][36] In January 2017, it was announced Kirke and Mosberg had split.[37][38] The couple had reportedly separated in the summer of 2016.[39]\n\n\nKirke is close friends with Lena Dunham, the creator of *Tiny Furniture* and *Girls*.[1] They became friends while attending Saint Ann's School in New York City.[1]\n\n\nKirke began a relationship with Australian musician and singer songwriter Alex Cameron in July 2017. Cameron has said that his 2019 album *Miami Memory* is primarily influenced by his relationship with Kirke.[40][41] The couple has since separated.[42]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2005\n | *Smile for the Camera* | Twin Singer (voice)\n | Short film\n |\n| 2010\n | *Tiny Furniture* | Charlotte\n |  |\n| 2015\n | *Ava's Possessions* | Ivy\n |  |\n| 2017\n | *The Little Hours* | Marta\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *Wild Honey Pie* | Gillian\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *Untogether* | Andrea Moore\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *All These Small Moments* | Odessa\n |  |\n| 2020\n | *Sylvie's Love* | Countess\n |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2012–2017\n | *Girls* | Jessa Johansson\n | Main role; 53 episodes\n |\n| 2015\n | *Axe Cop* | Water Queen (voice)\n | Episode: \"The Center of the Ocean\"\n |\n| 2015\n | *The Simpsons* | Candace's Friend (voice)\n | Episode: \"Every Man's Dream\"\n |\n| 2018\n | *Maniac* | Adelaide\n | Miniseries; 5 episodes\n |\n| 2019\n | *High Maintenance* | Herself\n | Episode: \"Breathwork\"\n |\n| 2021\n | *Sex Education* | Hope Haddon\n | Main role, Season 3; 8 episodes\n |\n| 2022\n | *Conversations with Friends* | Melissa\n | Main role; 12 episodes\n |\n| 2023\n | *City on Fire* | Regan Hamilton Sweeney\n | Main role; 8 episodes\n |\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Artist(s)\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\n | \"Dusk Till Dawn\"\n | Zayn featuring Sia |  |\n| 2017\n | \"Stranger's Kiss\"\n | Alex Cameron (duet with Angel Olsen)\n |  |\n| 2018\n | \"Studmuffin96\"\n | Alex Cameron\n | director\n |\n| 2019\n | \"Marlon Brando\"\n | Alex Cameron\n | director\n |\n| 2019\n | \"Miami Memory\"\n | Alex Cameron\n |  |\n| 2022\n | \"Best Life\"\n | Alex Cameron\n | director\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Rosen, Christopher (23 April 2012). \"Jemima Kirke, 'Girls' Star, On Periods, Collaborations And Sex Scenes\". *HuffPost*.

In 2017, she starred in Zayn's music video for the single \"Dusk Till Dawn\" featuring Sia.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and family[edit]\n\n\nBorn in London on 26 April 1985,[3] Kirke was raised in New York City.[4] She is the daughter of Simon Kirke, the former drummer of the rock bands Bad Company and Free.[5] Her mother is Lorraine Kirke (née Dellal), the owner of Geminola, a vintage boutique in New York City that supplied a number of outfits for the television series *Sex and the City*.[6] Her character Jessa wore a wedding dress from Geminola in the season finale of the first season of *Girls*; also, earlier in her career, she was featured along with her sisters in a fashion piece in *Teen Vogue* in which they wore clothing from the store.[7]\n\n\nHer father is of English and Scottish descent (the Kirkes being a junior branch of a family of Nottinghamshire landed gentry and descending also from the Gibson-Craig baronets)[8][9] and her mother is Jewish.[10] Kirke's maternal grandfather, Jack Dellal, was a British businessman of Iraqi-Jewish descent and her maternal grandmother, Zehava Helmer, was an Israeli flight attendant.[11][12][13] Kirke has two sisters, actress Lola Kirke and singer and actress Domino Kirke.[14][15][16] She is a cousin of curator Alexander Dellal,[17] shoe designer Charlotte Olympia Dellal and model/photographer Alice Dellal.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kirke's DJ set for sister Lola's VIP 2023 event in Manhattan.\n## Fine art[edit]\n\n\nKirke majored in art as a student and received her Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2008.[18] In late 2011, she held an exhibition titled \"A Brief History\" through Skylight Projects.[19] In late 2017 to early 2018 she had a show at Sargeant's Daughters, a Lower East Side gallery,[20] where she exhibited portrait-style paintings, some of them neck-up, others full-figure, of women in their wedding dresses. Kirke was inspired by her own divorce and the exhibition also contained a self-portrait of Kirke in her wedding dress and veil.[21][22]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Kirke presented for Batsheva Hay's spring collection at Ben's Kosher Deli.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jemima Kirke reading poetry at Church Street Boxing Gym in New York City.\n## Acting[edit]\n\n\nGrowing up in West Village, Kirke found herself accepting a number of roles on her friends' projects. Dunham asked Kirke to take on a supporting role in her debut film *Tiny Furniture*. Kirke and a number of other friends were called upon as a favour to Dunham since there was not enough money to pay professional actors.[*citation needed*] Although the film turned out to be profitable, Kirke received no payment.[24] Kirke reunited with Dunham in the HBO series *Girls*, appearing in all six seasons from 2011 to 2017 as the character Jessa Johansson. Kirke next had supporting roles in the dark comedy films *Ava's Possessions* and *The Little Hours*. In 2018, Kirke starred alongside her real-life sister Lola Kirke in Emma Forrest's film *Untogether*. The film premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival.[25]\n\n\nIn 2011, Kirke appeared in the music video \"Wring It Out\" for the group Rival Schools.[26] Both this music video and *Smile for the Camera* were directed by her friend Jordan Galland. In 2017, she appeared in the music video for \"Gotta Get a Grip\" by Mick Jagger, directed by Saam Farahmand and appeared opposite Alex Cameron in his music video for the song \"Stranger's Kiss\". In September 2017, Kirke appeared opposite Zayn Malik in his music video for the song \"Dusk Till Dawn\".\n\n\nIn 2021, Kirke appeared in the Netflix series *Sex Education* in the role of Hope, headmistress of Moordale Secondary School. In 2021, it was announced that Kirke had accepted a role in *Conversations with Friends*, a series based on the book of the same name by Sally Rooney, in which she plays Melissa, an older, experienced writer fascinated by a younger couple.[27][28] In 2023, Kirke starred in the Apple TV+ series City on Fire, based on the book of the same name.[29]\n\n\n\n## Directing[edit]\n\n\nKirke's directorial debut was in 2019 when she spearheaded the video for the track \"Mama\" by her sister Lola Kirke.[30] She would go onto direct other projects including multiple music videos and a satire short film with Alex Cameron.[31]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, Kirke partnered with the Center for Reproductive Rights to create a public service announcement to advance the future of reproductive healthcare.[32] In the PSA, Kirke discusses the abortion she received in college where she could not afford the anesthesia in addition to the procedure and went without.[32][33]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKirke resides in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn[34] and East Hampton. She married lawyer Michael Mosberg in 2009 and they have two children.[35][36] In January 2017, it was announced Kirke and Mosberg had split.[37][38] The couple had reportedly separated in the summer of 2016.[39]\n\n\nKirke is close friends with Lena Dunham, the creator of *Tiny Furniture* and *Girls*.[1] They became friends while attending Saint Ann's School in New York City.[1]\n\n\nKirke began a relationship with Australian musician and singer songwriter Alex Cameron in July 2017. Cameron has said that his 2019 album *Miami Memory* is primarily influenced by his relationship with Kirke.[40][41] The couple has since separated.[42]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2005\n | *Smile for the Camera* | Twin Singer (voice)\n | Short film\n |\n| 2010\n | *Tiny Furniture* | Charlotte\n |  |\n| 2015\n | *Ava's Possessions* | Ivy\n |  |\n| 2017\n | *The Little Hours* | Marta\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *Wild Honey Pie* | Gillian\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *Untogether* | Andrea Moore\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *All These Small Moments* | Odessa\n |  |\n| 2020\n | *Sylvie's Love* | Countess\n |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2012–2017\n | *Girls* | Jessa Johansson\n | Main role; 53 episodes\n |\n| 2015\n | *Axe Cop* | Water Queen (voice)\n | Episode: \"The Center of the Ocean\"\n |\n| 2015\n | *The Simpsons* | Candace's Friend (voice)\n | Episode: \"Every Man's Dream\"\n |\n| 2018\n | *Maniac* | Adelaide\n | Miniseries; 5 episodes\n |\n| 2019\n | *High Maintenance* | Herself\n | Episode: \"Breathwork\"\n |\n| 2021\n | *Sex Education* | Hope Haddon\n | Main role, Season 3; 8 episodes\n |\n| 2022\n | *Conversations with Friends* | Melissa\n | Main role; 12 episodes\n |\n| 2023\n | *City on Fire* | Regan Hamilton Sweeney\n | Main role; 8 episodes\n |\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Artist(s)\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\n | \"Dusk Till Dawn\"\n | Zayn featuring Sia |  |\n| 2017\n | \"Stranger's Kiss\"\n | Alex Cameron (duet with Angel Olsen)\n |  |\n| 2018\n | \"Studmuffin96\"\n | Alex Cameron\n | director\n |\n| 2019\n | \"Marlon Brando\"\n | Alex Cameron\n | director\n |\n| 2019\n | \"Miami Memory\"\n | Alex Cameron\n |  |\n| 2022\n | \"Best Life\"\n | Alex Cameron\n | director\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Rosen, Christopher (23 April 2012). \"Jemima Kirke, 'Girls' Star, On Periods, Collaborations And Sex Scenes\". *HuffPost*.
