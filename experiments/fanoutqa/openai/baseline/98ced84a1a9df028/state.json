Cameron's debut was the 1978 science fiction short *Xenogenesis*, which he directed, wrote and produced.[1][2] In his early career, he did various technical jobs such as special visual effects producer, set dresser assistant, matte artist, and photographer. His feature directorial debut was the 1982 release *Piranha II: The Spawning*.[2][3] The next film he directed was the science fiction action thriller *The Terminator* (1984) which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as the titular cyborg assassin, and was Cameron's breakthrough feature.[4][5][6] In 1986, he directed and wrote the science fiction action sequel *Aliens* starring Sigourney Weaver.[7] He followed this by directing another science fiction film *The Abyss* (1989). In 1991, Cameron directed the sequel to *The Terminator*, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (with Schwarzenegger reprising his role),[8] and also executive produced the action crime film *Point Break*. Three years later he directed a third Schwarzenegger-starring action film *True Lies* (1994).[9]\n\n\nIn 1997, Cameron directed, wrote, and produced the epic romantic disaster film *Titanic* which grossed over $1.8 billion[10][a] at the worldwide box-office and became the highest grossing of all time.[b] He received the Academy Award for Best Director, the Academy Award for Best Film Editing, and shared the Academy Award for Best Picture with the other producers. It had a total of 14 Oscar nominations (tying the record set by the 1950 drama *All About Eve*) and won 11 (tying the record set by the 1959 epic historical drama *Ben-Hur*).[15] Cameron also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director and shared the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture\u00a0\u2013 Drama with the other producers.[16] He followed this by directing, and producing two underwater documentaries: *Ghosts of the Abyss* (2003), and *Aliens of the Deep* (2005). He returned to directing features in 2009 with the 3D science fiction film *Avatar*. It grossed over $2.9 billion at the worldwide box-office and became the highest grossing of all time surpassing *Titanic*.[c][14][19] *Avatar* was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won three in technical categories.[20] Cameron also earned a second Golden Globe Award for Best Director, and Best Motion Picture\u00a0\u2013 Drama.[21] He followed this by executive producing two 3D films, *Sanctum* (2011) and *Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away* (2012), as well as the documentary *Deepsea Challenge 3D* (2014).\n\n\nCameron made his television debut in 1998 playing himself in the sitcom *Mad About You*. Two years later he executive produced the science fiction television series *Dark Angel* (2000) starring Jessica Alba. In 2005, he appeared in two documentaries about the sinking of the RMS Titanic: *Last Mysteries of the Titanic*, and *Tony Robinson's Titanic Adventure*. He also made appearances as himself on the comedy-drama television series *Entourage* that same year. Cameron followed this by executive producing two biblical documentaries, *The Exodus Decoded* (2006) and *Lost Tomb of Jesus* (2007). He executive produced and appeared in a third Titanic related documentary, *Titanic: Final Word with James Cameron*, in 2012. Two years later, Cameron executive produced the climate change documentary television series *Years of Living Dangerously* (2014) which received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.[22]\n\n\n\n\n## Film[edit]\n\n\n### Feature films[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of Cameron (right) with Aliens producer Gale Anne Hurd (left) in 1986](image)Cameron (right) with his then wife and *Aliens* producer Gale Anne Hurd (left) in 1986[23]\n![A photograph of Cameron receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2009](image)Cameron receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2009\n\n\nKey\n| \u2020\n | Denotes films that have not yet been released\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Credited as\n | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Director\n | Writer\n | Producer\n | Editor\n |\n| 1978\n | *Xenogenesis* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n | Short filmCo-directed and co-written with Randall FrakesAlso Visual effects producer\n | [1] |\n| 1982\n | *Piranha II: The Spawning* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n | No\n | Co-written with Ovidio G.

He is considered one of the founding pioneers of the New Hollywood era, as well as one of the most popular directors and producers in film history.[1] He is also one of the co-founders of Amblin Entertainment, DreamWorks Pictures, and DreamWorks Animation.\n\n\nIn a career spanning more than five decades, Spielberg's films have spanned many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood escapist filmmaking.[2] In later years, his films began addressing humanistic issues such as the Holocaust, the transatlantic slave trade, civil rights, war, and terrorism.\n\n\nSpielberg won the Academy Award for Best Director for *Schindler's List* and *Saving Private Ryan*, as well as receiving six other nominations.[3] Three of Spielberg's films\u2014*Jaws*, *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, and *Jurassic Park*\u2014achieved box office records, originated, and came to epitomize the blockbuster film.[4] The worldwide box office receipts of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $10\u00a0billion worldwide, making him the highest-grossing director in cinematic history.\n\n\n\n\n## Films[edit]\n\n\nSpielberg has worked as a producer, executive producer, director, or in an otherwise creative capacity on several films where he was not credited.\n\n\n\n### Director and writer[edit]\n\n\n#### Feature film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Film\n | Credited as\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Director | Producer | Writer |\n| 1964\n | *Firelight* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Amateur film; also editor, cinematographer and composer\n |  |\n| 1971\n | *Duel* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n | Extended theatrical version of original TV movie\n |  |\n| 1973\n | *Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies* | No\n | No\n | Story\n |  | [5] |\n| 1974\n | *The Sugarland Express* | Yes\n | No\n | Story\n | Theatrical film directing debut |  |\n| 1975\n | *Jaws* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n | Also uncredited played the voice of the Amity Point Lifestation Worker and a musician with a clarinet in orchestra\n | [6] |\n| 1977\n | *Close Encounters of the Third Kind* | Yes\n | No\n | Yes\n | Also visual effects concepts\n | [7] |\n| 1979\n | *1941* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [8] |\n| 1981\n | *Raiders of the Lost Ark* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [9] |\n| 1982\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [10] |\n| *Poltergeist* | No\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Co-writer with Michael Grais and Mark Victor.\n | [11][12] |\n| 1983\n | *Twilight Zone: The Movie* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n | Segment: \"Kick the Can\"\n | [13] |\n| 1984\n | *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [14] |\n| 1985\n | *The Color Purple* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [15] |\n| *The Goonies* | No\n | Executive\n | Story\n | Also uncredited 2nd unit director and editor\n |  |\n| 1987\n | *Empire of the Sun* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [16] |\n| 1989\n | *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [17] |\n| *Always* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [18] |\n| 1991\n | *Hook* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [19] |\n| 1993\n | *Jurassic Park* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [20] |\n| *Schindler's List* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [21] |\n| 1997\n | *The Lost World: Jurassic Park* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [22] |\n| *Amistad* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [23] |\n| 1998\n | *Saving Private Ryan* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [24] |\n| 2001\n | *A.I.
