The six signed the Treaty of Paris creating the European Coal and Steel Community on 18 April 1951 (which came into force on 23 July 1952). Following on from this, they attempted to create a European Defence Community: with the idea of allowing West Germany to rearm under the authority of a common European military command, a treaty was signed in 1952. However the plan was rejected by the Senate of France, which also scuppered the draft treaty for a European Political Community (which would have created a political federation to ensure democratic control over the new European army). \n\n\nDependency on overseas oil and the steady exhaustion of coal deposits led to the idea of an atomic energy community (a separate Community was favoured by Monnet, rather than simply extending the powers of the ECSC as suggested by the Common Assembly). However, the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) and Germany desired a common market. In order to reconcile the two ideas, both communities would be created.[1] Thus, the six went on to sign the Treaties of Rome in 1957, establishing the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community. The institutions of these communities would later be merged in 1967, leading to them collectively being known as the \"European Communities\". \n\n\n\n## Inner Six and Outer Seven[edit]\n\n\nThe \"Inner Six\" were in contrast to the **outer seven** group of countries who formed the European Free Trade Association rather than engage in supranational European integration. Five of the Outer Seven would themselves later join the European Communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![European Union](image) EC Members (Inner Six)\n | EFTA Members (Outer Seven)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| * ![](image)\u00a0Belgium\n* ![](image)\u00a0France\n* ![](image)\u00a0Italy\n* ![](image)\u00a0Luxembourg\n* ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands\n* ![](image)\u00a0West Germany\n | * ![](image)\u00a0Austria\n* ![](image)\u00a0Denmark\n* ![](image)\u00a0Norway\n* ![](image)\u00a0Portugal\n* ![](image)\u00a0Sweden\n* ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland\n* ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom\n |\n\n\n![](image)The EC Inner Six alongside the EFTA Outer Seven from 1960 to 1972EC Members (Inner Six)\nEFTA members (Outer Seven)\n\nThe six would continue in their co-operation until 1973 when they were joined by two of the Outer Seven (UK and Denmark) and Ireland.\n\n\n\n## Enlargement and Brexit: Nine, Ten, Twelve, Fifteen, and beyond[edit]\n\n\nThe events of the 1956 Suez Crisis showed the United Kingdom that it could no longer operate alone, instead turning to the United States and the European Communities. The United Kingdom, along with Denmark, Ireland and Norway, applied for membership in 1960. However, then\u2013French President Charles de Gaulle saw British membership of the Community as a Trojan horse for United States interests, and hence stated he would veto British membership.[2] The four countries resubmitted their applications on 11 May 1967 and with Georges Pompidou succeeding Charles de Gaulle as French President, the veto was lifted. Negotiations began in 1970 and two years later the accession treaties were signed with all but Norway acceding to the Community (Norway rejected membership in a 1972 referendum).\nIn 1981 Greece joined the European Community, bringing the number to ten. After its democratic revolution, Portugal would also leave EFTA to join the Communities in 1986, along with Spain. The twelve were joined by Sweden, Austria and Finland (which had joined EFTA in 1986) in 1995, leaving only Norway and Switzerland as the remaining members of the original outer seven, although EFTA had gained two new members (Iceland and Liechtenstein) in the intervening time. On the other hand, membership of the Communities, now the European Union (EU), had reached 28. With the approval of Brexit, which saw the United Kingdom leave the EU on 31 January 2020 after a June 2016 referendum and political negotiations, the EU currently has 27 members.\n\n\n\n## Modern \"inner\" groups[edit]\n\n\nToday, there are still some groups within the European Union integrating faster than others, for example the eurozone and Schengen Area (see: Opt-outs in the European Union). The Treaty of Lisbon includes provisions for a group of countries to integrate without the inclusions of others if they do not wish to join in as, following the rejection of the European Constitution, some leaders wished to create an inner, more highly integrated federal Europe within a slower-moving EU.\n\n\nThe Inner Six are today among the most integrated members of the EU.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Participant\n | Schengen | AFSJ | CFR | Euro | EEA | ESM | EFC | SRM | Euro+ | CSDP | Pr\u00fcm | Patent | Divorce | Symbols |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Belgium](image) Belgium | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n |\n| ![France](image) France | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n |\n| ![Germany](image) Germany | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n |\n| ![Italy](image) Italy | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n |\n| ![Luxembourg](image) Luxembourg | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n |\n| ![Netherlands](image) Netherlands | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | x\n | o\n | o\n |\n\n\n\u00a0x\u00a0 \u2013 member\n\n\n\u00a0o\u00a0 \u2013 non-member\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Arraiolos meeting\n* Big Four (Western Europe)\n* Craiova Group\n* Enlargement of the European Union\n* EU Med Group\n* European Economic Area\n* European Free Trade Association\n* EU three\n* G6 (EU)\n* Multi-speed Europe\n* Opt-outs in the European Union\n* Schengen Agreement\n* Visegr\u00e1d Group\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 1957-1968 Successes and crises European NAvigator\n2. **^** France's own lesson from Suez BBC News\n\n</content>\n</document>",

As the presidency is the supreme magistracy of the country, the position is the highest office in France. The powers, functions and duties of prior presidential offices, in addition to their relation with the prime minister and government of France, have over time differed with the various constitutional documents since the Second Republic. \n\n\nThe president of the French Republic is the *ex officio* co-prince of Andorra, grand master of the Legion of Honour and of the National Order of Merit. The officeholder is also honorary proto-canon of the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome, although some have rejected the title in the past. \n\n\nThe current president is Emmanuel Macron, who succeeded Fran\u00e7ois Hollande on 14 May 2017, and was inaugurated for a second term on 7 May 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe presidency of France was first publicly proposed during the July Revolution of 1830, when it was offered to the Marquis de Lafayette. He demurred in favour of Prince Louis Phillipe, who became King of the French. Eighteen years later, during the opening phases of the Second Republic, the title was created for a popularly elected head of state, the first of whom was Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, nephew of Emperor Napoleon. Bonaparte served in that role until he staged an auto coup against the republic, proclaiming himself Napoleon III, Emperor of the French. Under the Third Republic the president was at first quite powerful, mainly because the royalist party was strong when the constitutional laws of 1875 were established, and it was hoped that a member of one of the two branches of the royal family would be able to serve as president and turn France into a constitutional monarchy. However, the next legislature was dominated by Republicans, and after President Patrice de MacMahon had unsuccessfully tried to obtain a new royalist majority by dissolving the *Chambre des D\u00e9put\u00e9s*, his successor Jules Gr\u00e9vy promised in 1879 that he would not use his presidential power of dissolution, and therefore lost his control over the legislature, effectively creating a parliamentary system that would be maintained for 80 years until the accession of Charles de Gaulle as president in 1959.[2] Indeed, when the Fourth Republic was created, after the Second World War, it was a parliamentary system, in which the office of President of the Republic was a largely ceremonial one. The Constitution of the Fifth Republic, adopted in 1958, greatly increased the president's powers. A 1962 referendum changed the constitution, so that the president would be directly elected by universal suffrage and not by the electoral college established in 1958. In 2000, a referendum shortened the presidential term from seven years to five years. A maximum of two consecutive terms was imposed after a 2008 constitutional reform.\n\n\n\n## Election[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Presidential elections in France\n\n### Term limits[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1962 presidential referendum, the president has been directly elected by universal suffrage; previously, an electoral college decided the head of state. The length of the presidential term was reduced from seven years to five years following a 2000 referendum; the first election for a shorter term was held in 2002. Then-president Jacques Chirac was first elected in 1995 and again in 2002, and would have been able to run in 2007 had he chosen to, given the lack of term limits.\n\n\nFollowing a further change, the constitutional law of 2008 on the modernization of the institutions of the Fifth Republic, a president cannot serve more than two consecutive terms. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac were previously the only presidents to date who have served a full two terms (14 years for the former, 12 years for the latter). Incumbent Emmanuel Macron is the fourth president (after de Gaulle, Mitterrand, and Chirac) to win re-election, having done so in 2022.\n\n\n\n### Electoral process[edit]\n\n\nFrench presidential elections are conducted using run-off voting, which ensures that the elected president always obtains a majority: if no candidate receives a majority of votes in the first round of voting, the two highest-scoring candidates arrive at a run-off. After a new president is elected, they go through a solemn investiture ceremony called a *passation des pouvoirs* (\"handing over of powers\").[3]\n\n\nIn order to be admitted as an official candidate, potential candidates must receive signed nominations (known as *parrainages*, for \"sponsors\") from more than 500 elected local officials, mostly mayors. These officials must be from at least 30 *d\u00e9partements* or overseas collectivities, and no more than 10% of them should be from the same *d\u00e9partement* or collectivity.[4] Furthermore, each official may nominate only one candidate.[5]\n\n\nThere are exactly 45,543 elected officials, including 33,872 mayors. Spending and financing of campaigns and political parties are highly regulated. There is a cap on spending (at approximately \u20ac20\u00a0million) and government public financing of 50% of spending if the candidate scores more than 5%. If the candidate receives less than 5% of the vote, the government funds \u20ac8,000,000 to the party (\u20ac4,000,000 paid in advance).[6] Advertising on TV is forbidden, but official time is given to candidates on public TV. An independent agency regulates election and party financing.\n\n\n\n## Powers[edit]\n\n\nThe French Fifth Republic is a semi-presidential system. Unlike other European presidents, the French president is quite powerful. Although the Prime Minister of France, through their government as well as Parliament, oversee much of the nation's actual day-to-day domestic affairs, the French president wields significant influence and authority, especially in the fields of national security and foreign policy. The president's greatest power is the ability to choose the prime minister. However, since it is the French National Assembly that has the sole power to dismiss the prime minister's government, the president is forced to name a prime minister who can command the support of a majority in the assembly. Since 2002, the legislative elections are held a few weeks after the presidential; a majority supporting the president's party or at the very least not opposing the president's choice is therefore very likely to be obtained. They have also the duty of arbitrating the functioning of governmental authorities for efficient service, as the head of state of France.\n\n\n\n* When a majority of the Assembly has opposite political views to that of the president, this leads to political *cohabitation*. In that case, the President's power is diminished, since much of the *de facto* power relies on a supportive prime minister and National Assembly, and is not directly attributed to the post of president.\n* When the majority of the Assembly sides with them, the president can take a more active role and may further influence government policy. The prime minister is then a more personal choice of the president, and can be easily replaced if the administration becomes unpopular. This device has been used in recent years by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Jacques Chirac, and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n\n\nSince 2002, the mandate of the president and the Assembly are both five years, and the two elections are close to each other. Therefore, the likelihood of a *cohabitation* is lower. Among the powers of the president:\n\n\n\n* The president promulgates laws.\n\t+ The president has a suspensive veto: when presented with a law, they can request another reading of it by the Parliament, but only once per law.\n\t+ The president may also refer the law for review to the Constitutional Council prior to promulgation.\n* The president may dissolve the French National Assembly.\n* The president may refer treaties or certain types of laws to popular referendum, within certain conditions (among them the agreement of the prime minister or the Parliament).\n* The president is the Chief of the Armed Forces.\n* The president may order the use of nuclear weapons.\n* The president names the prime minister. In theory, they cannot directly dismiss them, but at least a few recent PM's are known to have given an undated letter of resignation for themselves to the president upon taking office, and the president generally has some influence over the PM. The president also names and dismisses the other ministers, with the advice of the prime minister.\n* The president names most officials (with the assent of the cabinet).\n* The president names certain members of the Constitutional Council. (Former presidents are also members of this council)\n* The president receives foreign ambassadors.\n* The president may grant a pardon (but not an amnesty) to convicted criminals; the president can also lessen or suppress criminal sentences. This was of crucial importance when France still operated the death penalty: criminals sentenced to death would generally request that the president commute their sentence to life imprisonment.\n\n\nAll decisions of the president must be countersigned by the prime minister, except dissolving the National Assembly, choice of prime minister, and other dispositions referred to in Article 19.\n\n\n\n### Detailed constitutional powers[edit]\n\n\nThe constitutional attributions of the president are defined in Title II of the Constitution of France.\n\n\n**Article 5**: The president of the republic shall see that the Constitution is observed. He shall ensure, by his arbitration, the proper functioning of the public authorities and the continuity of the State. He shall be the guarantor of national independence, territorial integrity and observance of treaties.\n\n\n**Article 8**: The president of the republic shall appoint the prime minister. He shall terminate the appointment of the prime minister when the latter tenders the resignation of the Government. On the proposal of the prime minister, he shall appoint the other members of the Government and terminate their appointments.\n\n\n**Article 9**: The president of the republic shall preside over the Council of Ministers.\n\n\n**Article 10:** The president of the republic shall promulgate acts of parliament within fifteen days following the final adoption of an act and its transmission to the Government. He may, before the expiry of this time limit, ask Parliament to reconsider the act or sections of the Act. Reconsideration shall not be refused. *While the President has to sign all acts adopted by parliament into law, he cannot refuse to do so and exercise a kind of right of veto; his only power in that matter is to ask for a single reconsideration of the law by parliament and this power is subject to countersigning by the Prime minister.*\n\n\n**Article 11:** The president could submit laws to the people in a referendum with advice and consent of the cabinet.\n\n\n**Article 12**: The president of the republic may, after consulting the prime minister and the presidents of the assemblies, declare the National Assembly dissolved. A general election shall take place not less than twenty days and not more than forty days after the dissolution. The National Assembly shall convene as of right on the second Thursday following its election. Should it so convene outside the period prescribed for the ordinary session, a session shall be called by right for a fifteen-day period. No further dissolution shall take place within a year following this election.\n\n\n**Article 13:** The president of the republic shall sign the ordinances and decrees deliberated upon in the Council of Ministers. He shall make appointments to the civil and military posts of the State. [...]\n\n\n**Article 14**: The president of the republic shall accredit ambassadors and envoys extraordinary to foreign powers; foreign ambassadors and envoys extraordinary shall be accredited to him.\n\n\n**Article 15**: The president of the republic shall be commander-in-chief of the armed forces. He shall preside over the higher national defence councils and committees.\n\n\n**Article 16**: Where the institutions of the republic, the independence of the nation, the integrity of its territory or the fulfilment of its international commitments are under serious and immediate threat, and where the proper functioning of the constitutional public authorities is interrupted, the president of the republic shall take the measures required by these circumstances, after formally consulting the prime minister, the presidents of the assemblies and the Constitutional Council. He shall inform the nation of these measures in a message. The measures must stem from the desire to provide the constitutional public authorities, in the shortest possible time, with the means to carry out their duties. The Constitutional Council shall be consulted with regard to such measures. Parliament shall convene as of right. The National Assembly shall not be dissolved during the exercise of the emergency powers.\n\n\n***Article 16**, allowing the president a limited form of rule by decree for a limited period of time in exceptional circumstance, has been used only once, by Charles de Gaulle during the Algerian War, from 23 April to 29 September 1961.*\n\n\n**Article 17**: The president of the republic has the right to grant pardon.\n\n\n**Article 18**: The president of the republic shall communicate with the two assemblies of Parliament by means of messages, which he shall cause to be read and which shall not be the occasion for any debate. He can also give an address in front of the Congress of France in Versailles. Outside sessions, Parliament shall be convened especially for this purpose.[7]\n\n\n**Article 19**: Acts of the president of the republic, other than those provided for under articles 8 (first paragraph), 11, 12, 16, 18, 54, 56 and 61, shall be countersigned by the prime minister and, where required, by the appropriate ministers.\n\n\n\n### Presidential amnesties[edit]\n\n\nBefore the 2008 constitutional reform forbidding them, there was a tradition of so-called \"presidential amnesties\", which are something of a misnomer: after the election of a president, and of a National Assembly of the same party, parliament would traditionally vote a law granting amnesty for some petty crimes (it was also a way of reducing jail overpopulation). This practice had been increasingly criticized, particularly because it was believed to inspire people to commit traffic offences in the months preceding the election. Such an amnesty law would also authorize the president to designate individuals who have committed certain categories of crimes to be offered amnesty, if certain conditions are met. Such individual measures have been criticized for the political patronage that they allow. The difference between an amnesty and a presidential pardon is that the former clears all subsequent effects of the sentencing, as though the crime had not been committed, while pardon simply relieves the sentenced individual from part or all of the remainder of the sentence.\n\n\n\n## Criminal responsibility and impeachment[edit]\n\n\nArticles 67 and 68 organize the regime of criminal responsibility of the president. They were reformed by a 2007 constitutional act[8] in order to clarify a situation that previously resulted in legal controversies.[9] The president of the Republic enjoys immunity during their term: they cannot be requested to testify before any jurisdiction, they cannot be prosecuted, etc. However, the statute of limitation is suspended during their term, and enquiries and prosecutions can be restarted, at the latest one month after they leave office. The president is not deemed personally responsible for their actions in their official capacity, except where their actions are indicted before the International Criminal Court (France is a member of the ICC and the president is a French citizen as another following the Court's rules) or where impeachment is moved against them. Impeachment can be pronounced by the Republican High Court, a special court convened from both houses of Parliament on the proposal of either House, should the president have failed to discharge their duties in a way that evidently precludes the continuation of their term.\n\n\n\n## Succession and incapacity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alain Poher, Acting President of France in 1969 and 1974\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on**Orders of succession** |\n| Presidencies |\n| * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Brazil\n* Colombia\n* China\n* DR Congo\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Ireland\n* Republic of Korea\n* Mexico\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Romania\n* Sri Lanka\n* Taiwan\n* United States\n* Uruguay\n* Vietnam\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nUpon the death in office, removal, or resignation of the president, the Senate's president takes over as acting president.[10] Alain Poher is the only person to have served in this temporary position, and has done so twice: the first time in 1969 after Charles de Gaulle's resignation and a second time in 1974 after Georges Pompidou's death while in office. In this situation, the president of the Senate becomes Acting President of the Republic; they do not become the new president of the Republic as elected and therefore do not have to resign from their position as President of the Senate. \n\n\nThe first round of a new presidential election must be organized no sooner than twenty days and no later than thirty-five days following the vacancy of the presidency. Fifteen days can separate the first and second rounds of a presidential election; this means that the president of the Senate can only act as President of the Republic for a maximum period of fifty days. \n\n\nDuring this interim period, acting presidents are not allowed to dismiss the national assembly, nor are they allowed to call for a referendum or initiate any constitutional changes. If there is no president of the Senate, the powers of the president of the republic are exercised by the *Gouvernement*, meaning the Cabinet. This has been interpreted by some constitutional academics as meaning first the prime minister and, if they are themselves not able to act, the members of the cabinet in the order of the list of the decree that nominated them. This is in fact unlikely to happen, because if the president of the Senate is not able to act, the Senate will normally name a new president of the Senate, who will act as President of the Republic. \n\n\nDuring the Third French Republic the president of the Council of Ministers acted as president whenever the office was vacant.[11] According to article 7 of the Constitution, if the presidency becomes vacant for any reason, or if the president becomes incapacitated, upon the request of the *Gouvernement*, the Constitutional Council may rule, by a majority vote,[12] that the presidency is to be temporarily assumed by the president of the Senate. If the Council rules that the incapacity is permanent, the same procedure as for the resignation is applied, as described above. If the president cannot attend meetings, including meetings of the Council of Ministers, they can ask the prime minister to attend in their stead (Constitution, article 21). This clause has been applied by presidents travelling abroad, ill, or undergoing surgery. During the Second French Republic, there was a vice president. The only person to ever hold the position was Henri Georges Boulay de la Meurthe.\n\n\n\n## Death in office[edit]\n\n\nFour French presidents have died in office:\n\n\n\n* Sadi Carnot, who was assassinated by Sante Geronimo Caserio on 25 June 1894, aged 56.\n* F\u00e9lix Faure, who died on 16 February 1899, aged 58.\n* Paul Doumer, who was assassinated by Paul Gorguloff on 7 May 1932, aged 75, the oldest to die in office.\n* Georges Pompidou, who died on 2 April 1974, aged 62.\n\n\n## Pay and official residences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, the principal residence of the president\nThe president of the Republic is paid a salary according to a pay grade defined in comparison to the pay grades of the most senior members of the French Civil Service (\"out of scale\", *hors \u00e9chelle*, those whose pay grades are known as letters and not as numeric indices). In addition they are paid a residence stipend of 3%, and a function stipend of 25% on top of the salary and residence indemnity. This gross salary and these indemnities are the same as those of the prime minister, and are 50% higher than the highest paid to other members of the government,[13] which is itself defined as twice the average of the highest (pay grade G) and the lowest (pay grade A1) salaries in the \"out of scale\" pay grades.[14] Using the 2008 \"out of scale\" pay grades,[15] it amounts to a monthly pay of 20,963 euros, which fits the 19,000 euros quoted to the press in early 2008.[16] Using the pay grades starting from 1 July 2009,[17] this amounts to a gross monthly pay of \u20ac21,131. The salary and the residence stipend are taxable for income tax.[18] The official residence and office of the president is the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris. Other presidential residences include:\n\n\n\n* the H\u00f4tel de Marigny, standing next to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, houses foreign official guests;\n* the Ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet is normally open to visitors when not used for (rare) official meetings;\n* the Domaine national de Marly is normally open to visitors when not used for (rare) official meetings;\n* the Fort de Br\u00e9gan\u00e7on, in Southeastern France, is the official presidential vacation residence. In 2013, it became a national monument and is opened to the public some moments since 2014. The French president's private quarters there are still available for their use. La Lanterne became an official presidential vacation residence in 2007.\n\n\n## Latest election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 French presidential election\n\n## Pension and benefits[edit]\n\n\nAccording to French law, former presidents of the Republic have guaranteed lifetime pension defined according to the pay grade of the Councillors of State,[19] a courtesy diplomatic passport,[20] and, according to the French Constitution (Article 56), membership of the Constitutional Council. They also get personnel, an apartment and/or office, and other amenities, though the legal basis for these is disputed. The current system for providing personnel and other amenities to the former French presidents was devised in 1981 by Michel Charasse, then advisor to President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, in order to care for former president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing and the widow of former President Georges Pompidou.[21] In 2008, according to an answer by the services of the prime minister to a question from Ren\u00e9 Dosi\u00e8re, a member of the National Assembly,[22] the facilities comprised: a security detail, a car with a chauffeur, first class train tickets and an office or housing space, as well as a two people who service the space. In addition, funds are available for seven permanent assistants. President Hollande announced a reform of the system in 2016. Former presidents of France will no longer receive a car with chauffeur and the personnel in their living space was cut as well. Additionally, the number of assistants available for their use has been reduced, but a state flat or house remains available for former officeholders. Train tickets are also available if the trip is justified by the office of the former officeholder as part of official business. The security personnel around former presidents of France remained unchanged.[23]\n\n\n\n## Lists relating to the presidents of France[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n* List of French non-presidential heads of state by tenure\n* List of presidents of France\n* List of presidents of France by tenure\n* French presidential inauguration\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique: 14 910 \u20ac bruts par mois, Le Journal Du Net\n2. **^** \"Jules Gr\u00e9vy 1879 \u2013 1887\". *\u00c9LYS\u00c9E*. 15 November 2018.

The president has a ceremonial role (figurehead), but also has the right and duty to act politically.[3] He can give direction to general political and societal debates and have some important \"reserve powers\" in case of political instability (such as those provided for by Article 81 of the Basic Law).[4] The president also holds the prerogative to grant pardons on behalf of the federation. The German presidents, who can be elected to two consecutive five-year terms, have wide discretion about how they exercise their official duties.[5]\n\n\nUnder Article 59 (1) of the Basic Law (German Constitution), the president represents the Federal Republic of Germany in matters of international law, concludes treaties with foreign states on its behalf and accredits diplomats.[6] Furthermore, all federal laws must be signed by the president before they can come into effect; presidents may veto a law if they believe it to violate the constitution.\n\n\nThe president's actions and public appearances represent the state itself, its existence, legitimacy, and unity. The president enjoys a higher ranking at official functions than the chancellor. The president's role is integrative and includes the control function of upholding the law and the constitution. It is a matter of political tradition \u2013 not legal restrictions \u2013 that the president generally does not comment routinely on issues in the news, particularly when there is some controversy among the political parties.[7] This distance from day-to-day politics and daily governmental issues allows the president to be a source of clarification, to influence public debate, voice criticism, offer suggestions and make proposals. In order to exercise this power, he traditionally acts above party politics.[7]\n\n\nThe current officeholder is Frank-Walter Steinmeier who was elected on 12 February 2017 and re-elected on 13 February 2022. He is currently serving his second five-year-term, which began on 19 March 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Federal Convention (Germany)\n\nThe president is elected for a term of five years by secret ballot, without debate, by a specially convened Federal Convention which mirrors the aggregated majority position in the Bundestag (the federal parliament) and in the parliaments of the 16 German states. The convention consists of all Bundestag members, as well as an equal number of electors elected by the state legislatures in proportion to their respective populations. Since reunification, all Federal Conventions have had more than 1200 members, as the Bundestag has always had more than 600 parliamentarians since then. It is not required that state electors are chosen from the members of the state legislature; often some prominent citizens are chosen.\n\n\nThe German constitution, the Basic Law, requires that the convention be convened no later than 30 days before the scheduled expiry of the sitting president's term or 30 days after a premature expiry of a president's term. The body is convened and chaired by the President of the Bundestag. From 1979 to 2009, all these conventions were held on 23 May, the anniversary of the foundation of the Federal Republic in 1949. The resignation of Horst K\u00f6hler in 2010, which necessitated an early meeting of the Federal Convention, brought this tradition to an end.\n\n\nIn the first two rounds of the election, the candidate who achieves an absolute majority is elected. If, after two votes, no single candidate has received this level of support, in the third and final vote the candidate who wins a plurality of votes cast is elected.\n\n\nThe result of the election is often determined by party politics. In most cases, the candidate of the majority party or coalition in the Bundestag is considered to be the likely winner. However, as the members of the Federal Convention vote by secret ballot and are free to vote against their party's candidate, some presidential elections were considered open or too close to call beforehand because of relatively balanced majority positions or because the governing coalition's parties could not agree on one candidate and endorsed different people, as they did in 1969, when Gustav Heinemann won by only six votes on the third ballot. In other cases, elections have turned out to be much closer than expected. For example, in 2010, Wulff was expected to win on the first ballot, as the parties supporting him (CDU, CSU and FDP) had a stable absolute majority in the Federal Convention. Nevertheless, he failed to win a majority in the first and second ballots, while his main opponent Joachim Gauck had an unexpectedly strong showing. In the end, Wulff obtained a majority in the third ballot. If the opposition has turned in a strong showing in state elections, it can potentially have enough support to defeat the chancellor's party's candidate; this happened in the elections in 1979 and 2004. For this reason, presidential elections can indicate the result of an upcoming general election. According to a long-standing adage in German politics, \"if you can create a President, you can form a government.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Past presidential elections[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Election | Date | Site | Ballots | Winner  (endorsing parties)[a] | Electoral votes  (percentage) | Runner-up  (endorsing parties)[b] | Electoral votes  (percentage)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1st Federal Convention | 12 September 1949 | Bonn | 2 | Theodor Heuss  (**FDP**, **CDU**, **CSU)** | 416 (51.7%) | Kurt Schumacher  (SPD) | 312 (38.8%)\n |\n| 2nd Federal Convention | 17 July 1954 | West Berlin | 1 | Theodor Heuss  (**FDP**, **CDU**, **CSU**, SPD) | 871 (85.6%) | Alfred Weber  (KPD) | 12 (1.2%)\n |\n| 3rd Federal Convention | 1 July 1959 | West Berlin | 2 | Heinrich L\u00fcbke  (**CDU**, **CSU**) | 526 (50.7%) | Carlo Schmid  (SPD) | 386 (37.2%)\n |\n| 4th Federal Convention | 1 July 1964 | West Berlin | 1 | Heinrich L\u00fcbke  (**CDU**, **CSU**, SPD) | 710 (68.1%) | Ewald Bucher  (**FDP**) | 123 (11.8%)\n |\n| 5th Federal Convention | 5 March 1969 | West Berlin | 3 | Gustav Heinemann  (**SPD**, FDP) | 512 (49.4%) | Gerhard Schr\u00f6der  (**CDU**, **CSU**, NPD) | 506 (48.8%)\n |\n| 6th Federal Convention | 15 May 1974 | Bonn | 1 | Walter Scheel  (**FDP**, **SPD**) | 530 (51.2%) | Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker  (CDU, CSU) | 498 (48.1%)\n |\n| 7th Federal Convention | 23 May 1979 | Bonn | 1 | Karl Carstens  (CDU, CSU) | 528 (51%) | Annemarie Renger  (**SPD**) | 431 (41.6%)\n |\n| 8th Federal Convention | 23 May 1984 | Bonn | 1 | Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker  (**CDU**, **CSU**, **FDP**, SPD) | 832 (80%) | Luise Rinser  (Greens) | 68 (6.5%)\n |\n| 9th Federal Convention | 23 May 1989 | Bonn | 1 | Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker  (**CDU**, **CSU**, **FDP**, SPD) | 881 (84.9%) | none | 108 (10.4%) no-votes\n |\n| 10th Federal Convention | 23 May 1994 | Berlin | 3 | Roman Herzog  (**CDU**, **CSU**) | 696 (52.6%) | Johannes Rau  (SPD) | 605 (45.7%)\n |\n| 11th Federal Convention | 23 May 1999 | Berlin | 2 | Johannes Rau  (**SPD**, **Greens**) | 690 (51.6%) | Dagmar Schipanski  (CDU, CSU) | 572 (42.8%)\n |\n| 12th Federal Convention | 23 May 2004 | Berlin | 1 | Horst K\u00f6hler  (CDU, CSU, FDP) | 604 (50.1%) | Gesine Schwan  (**SPD**, **Greens**) | 589 (48.9%)\n |\n| 13th Federal Convention | 23 May 2009 | Berlin | 1 | Horst K\u00f6hler  (**CDU**, **CSU**, FDP, FW) | 613 (50.1%) | Gesine Schwan  (**SPD**, Greens) | 503 (41.1%)\n |\n| 14th Federal Convention | 30 June 2010 | Berlin | 3 | Christian Wulff  (**CDU**, **CSU**, **FDP**) | 625 (50.2%) | Joachim Gauck  (SPD, Greens) | 494 (39.7%)\n |\n| 15th Federal Convention | 18 March 2012 | Berlin | 1 | Joachim Gauck  (**CDU**, **CSU**, **FDP**, SPD, Greens, Free Voters, SSW) | 991 (79.9%) | Beate Klarsfeld  (The Left) | 126 (10.2%)\n |\n| 16th Federal Convention | 12 February 2017 | Berlin | 1 | Frank-Walter Steinmeier  (**SPD**, **CDU**, **CSU**, Greens, FDP, SSW) | 931 (74.3%) | Christoph Butterwegge  (The Left) | 128 (10.2%)\n |\n| 17th Federal Convention | 13 February 2022 | Berlin | 1 | Frank-Walter Steinmeier  (**SPD**, **Greens**,  **FDP**, CDU, CSU, SSW) | 1045 (72.7%) | Max Otte (AfD) | 140 (9.74%)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** governing parties in bold\n2. **^** governing parties in bold\n\n### Qualifications[edit]\n\n\nThe office of president is open to all Germans who are entitled to vote in Bundestag elections and have reached the age of 40, but no one may serve more than two consecutive five-year terms. As yet (2022), only five presidents (Heuss, L\u00fcbke, von Weizs\u00e4cker, K\u00f6hler and Steinmeier (in office)) have been elected for a second term and only two of them (Heuss and von Weizs\u00e4cker) completed those terms, while L\u00fcbke and K\u00f6hler resigned during their second term. The president must not be a member of the federal government or of a legislature at either the federal or state level.\n\n\n\n### Oath[edit]\n\n\nAfter taking office the president must take the following oath, stipulated by Article 56 of the Basic Law, in a joint session of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat (it is the only event that demands such a joint session constitutionally). The religious references may optionally be omitted.\n\n\n\n\n> I swear that I will dedicate my efforts to the well-being of the German people, promote their welfare, protect them from harm, uphold and defend the Basic Law and the laws of the Federation, perform my duties conscientiously and do justice to all. (So help me God.)[8]\n> \n> \n\n\nGerman constitutional law does not consider oaths of office as *constitutive* but only as *affirmative*. This means that the president does not have to take the oath at the moment of entering office in order to be able to exercise its constitutional powers. In practice, the oath is usually administered during the first days or weeks of a president's term on a date convenient for a joint session of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. Nevertheless, in theory a persistent refusal to take the oath is considered to be an impeachable offence by legal scholars.[9] If a president is re-elected for a second consecutive term, he does not take the oath again.\n\n\n\n## Duties and functions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bellevue Palace, Berlin (primary seat)\n![](image)Hammerschmidt Villa, Bonn (secondary seat)\nThe president is involved in the formation of the Federal Government and remains in close cooperation with it. Basically, the president is free to act on his own discretion. However, according to Article 58 of the German constitution, the decrees, and directives of the president require the countersignature of the chancellor or the corresponding federal minister in charge of the respective field of politics. This rule ensures the coherence of government action, similar to the system of checks and balances in the United States. There is no need for a countersignature if the president proposes, appoints or dismisses the chancellor, convenes or dissolves the Bundestag according to Article 63, declares a legislative state of emergency, calls on a chancellor and ministers to remain in office after the end of a chancellor's term until a successor is elected or exercises his right to pardon on behalf of the federation, as these are exclusive powers of the president.\n\n\nTherefore, the president also receives the chancellor regularly for talks on current policy issues. German presidents also hold talks with individual federal ministers and other senior officials at their own discretion. The \"Head of the Office of the President\" represents the will and views of the president in the meetings of the Federal Cabinet and reports back to the president.[10]\n\n\nThe president's most prominent powers and duties include:[10]\n\n\n\n* Proposing the chancellor to the Bundestag\n* Appointing and dismissing the chancellor and their cabinet ministers\n* Dissolving the Bundestag under certain circumstances\n* Declaring the legislative state of emergency under certain circumstances\n* Convening the Bundestag\n* Signing and promulgating laws or vetoing them under certain circumstances\n* Appointing and dismissing federal judges, federal civil servants, and commissioned and non-commissioned officers of the Armed Forces\n* Exercising the power to pardon individual offenders on behalf of the Federation\n* Awarding honors on behalf of the Federation\n* Representing Germany at home and abroad\n\n\n### Appointment of the Federal Government[edit]\n\n\nAfter the constitution of every new elected Bundestag, which automatically ends the term of the chancellor, and in every other case in which the office of chancellor has fallen vacant (death or resignation), the president will propose an individual as chancellor and must then, provided the individual is subsequently elected by a majority of the members of the current Bundestag (the so-called *Chancellor-majority)* on the first ballot, appoint the elected candidate to office. However, the Bundestag is also free to disregard the president's proposal (which has, as of 2022, never happened), in which case the parliament must within 14 days elect another individual, whom the parties in the Bundestag now choose themselves, to the post with the same so-called *Chancellor-majority*, whom the president is then obliged to appoint. If the Bundestag does not manage to do so, on the 15th day after the first ballot the Bundestag must hold one last ballot: if an individual is elected with the *Chancellor-majority*, the president is also obliged to appoint the elected candidate. If no clear consensus was reached, the president can either appoint as chancellor the individual who received a plurality of votes on this last ballot or dissolve the Bundestag. The president can dismiss the chancellor, but only if and when the Bundestag passes a constructive vote of no confidence, electing a new chancellor with the *Chancellor-majority* at the same time.[11] If this occurs, the president must dismiss the chancellor and appoint the successor elected by the Bundestag.[11]\n\n\nThe president also appoints and dismisses the remaining members of the federal government upon proposal of the chancellor. This theoretically means that the president can appoint only those candidates presented by the chancellor. It is unclear whether the president could refuse to dismiss or appoint a federal minister proposed, as no president has ever done so.\n\n\nIn practice, the president only proposes a person as chancellor who has previously garnered a majority support in prior coalition talks and traditionally does not interfere in those talks. However, after the \"Jamaica coalition\" talks failed in the wake of the 2017 election, President Steinmeier invited several Bundestag party leaders to try to bring them together to form a working government.\n\n\n\n### Other appointments[edit]\n\n\nThe president appoints federal judges, federal civil servants, and military officers.\n\n\n\n### Dissolution of the Bundestag[edit]\n\n\nIn case the Bundestag elects an individual for the office of chancellor by a plurality of votes, rather than a majority, on the 15th day of the election process, the president can, at his discretion, either appoint that individual as chancellor or dissolve the Bundestag, triggering a new election. If a vote of confidence is defeated in the Bundestag, and the incumbent chancellor proposes a dissolution, then the president may, at his discretion, dissolve the body within 21 days. As of 2022, this power has only been applied three times in the history of the Federal Republic. In all three occurrences, it is doubtful whether the motives for that dissolution were in accordance with the constitution's intentions. Each time the incumbent chancellor called for the vote of confidence with the stated intention of being defeated, in order to be able to call for new elections before the end of his regular term, as the Basic Law does not give the Bundestag a right to dissolve itself. The most recent occurrence was on 1 July 2005, when Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der asked for a vote of confidence[a], which was defeated.[12]\n\n\n\n### Promulgation of the law[edit]\n\n\nAll federal laws must be signed by the president before they can come into effect.[13] The president may refuse to sign the law, thus effectively vetoing it. In principle, the president has the full veto authority on any bill, but this, however, is not how past presidents handled their power.[14] Usually, the president checks if the law was passed according to the order mandated by the Constitution and/or if the content of the law is constitutional. Only in cases in which the incumbent president had serious doubts about the constitutionality of a bill laid before him, he has refused to sign it. It also has to be stated that the president may at his own discretion sign such a \"vetoed\" bill at any later time, if for example the Basic Law has been changed in the relevant aspect or if the bill in question has been amended according to his concerns, because his initial refusal to sign a bill is not technically a final veto.\n\n\nAs yet (2022), this has happened only nine times and no president has done it more often than two times during his term:\n\n\n\n* In 1951, Theodor Heuss vetoed a bill concerning income and corporation taxes, because it lacked the consent of the Bundesrat (in Germany some bills at the federal level need the consent of the Bundesrat, and some do not, which can be controversial at times).\n* In 1961, Heinrich L\u00fcbke refused to sign a bill concerning business and workforce trades he believed to be unconstitutional, because of a violation of the free choice of job.\n* In 1969, Gustav Heinemann vetoed the \"Engineer Act\", because he believed this legislative area to be under the authority of the states.\n* In 1970, Gustav Heinemann refused to sign the \"Architects Act\" for the same reason.\n* In 1976, Walter Scheel vetoed a bill about simplification measures regarding the conscientious objection of conscription, because it lacked the \u2013 in his opinion necessary \u2013 consent of the Bundesrat.\n* In 1991, Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker refused to sign an amendment to the \"Air Traffic Act\" allowing the privatization of the air traffic administration, which he believed to be unconstitutional. He signed the bill later after the \"Basic Law\" was changed in this aspect.\n* In 2006, Horst K\u00f6hler vetoed a bill concerning flight control, because he believed it to be unconstitutional.\n* Later the same year, Horst K\u00f6hler vetoed the \"Consumer Information Act\" for the same reason.\n* In 2020, Frank-Walter Steinmeier refused to sign the \"Hate Speech Act\" because of concerns about its constitutionality. In a letter sent to the Bundesrat, he stated his intent to sign the bill, if accordingly amended in a reasonable time.[15] He did so in April 2021.[16]\n\n\nKarl Carstens, Roman Herzog, Johannes Rau, Christian Wulff and Joachim Gauck have signed and promulgated all bills during their respective terms.[17]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nThe president represents Germany in the world (Art. 59 Basic Law), undertakes foreign visits and receives foreign dignitaries. He also concludes treaties with foreign nations (which do not come into effect until affirmed by the Bundestag), accredits German diplomats and receives the letters of accreditation of foreign diplomats.\n\n\n\n### Pardons and honours[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Article 60 (2) of the German Constitution, the president has the power to pardon. This means the president \"has the authority to revoke or commute penal or disciplinary sentences in individual cases. The federal president cannot, however, issue an amnesty waiving or commuting sentences for a whole category of offenses. That requires a law enacted by the Bundestag in conjunction with the Bundesrat. Due to the federal structure of Germany the federal president is only responsible for dealing with certain criminal matters (e.g. espionage and terrorism) and disciplinary proceedings against federal civil servants, federal judges, and soldiers\".[18]\n\n\nIt is customary that the federal president becomes the honorary godfather of the seventh child in a family if the parents wish it. He also sends letters of congratulations to centenarians and long-time married couples.[19]\n\n\n\n### Legislative state of emergency[edit]\n\n\nArticle 81 makes it possible to enact a law without the approval of the Bundestag: if the Bundestag rejects a motion of confidence, but a new chancellor is not elected nor is the Bundestag dissolved, the chancellor can declare a draft law to be \"urgent\". If the Bundestag refuses to approve the draft, the cabinet can ask the federal president to declare a \"legislative state of emergency\" (*Gesetzgebungsnotstand*) with regard to that specific law proposal.\n\n\nAfter the declaration of the president, the Bundestag has four weeks to discuss the draft law. If it does not approve it the cabinet can ask the Federal Council for approval. After the consent of the Federal Council is secured, the draft law becomes law.\n\n\nThere are some constraints on the \"legislative state of emergency\". After a president has declared the state of emergency for the first time, the government has only six months to use the procedure for other law proposals. Given the terms provided by the constitution, it is unlikely that the government can enact more than one other draft law in this way.\n\n\nAlso, the emergency has to be declared afresh for every proposal. This means that the six months are not a period in which the government together with the president and the Federal Council simply replaces the Bundestag as lawgiver. The Bundestag remains fully competent to pass laws during these six months. The state of emergency also ends if the office of the chancellor ends. During the same term and after the six months, the chancellor cannot use the procedure of Article 81 again.\n\n\nA \"legislative state of emergency\" has never been declared. In case of serious disagreement between the chancellor and the Bundestag, the chancellor resigns or the Bundestag faces new elections. The provision of Article 81 is intended to assist the government for a short time, but not to use it in crisis for a longer period. According to constitutional commentator Bryde, Article 81 provides the executive (government) with the power to \"enable decrees in a state of emergency\" (*exekutives Notverordnungsrecht*), but for historical reasons the constitution avoided this expression.[20]\n\n\n\n## Politics and influence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Former President Joachim Gauck and his partner Daniela Schadt\nThough candidates are usually selected by a political party or parties, the president nonetheless is traditionally expected to refrain from being an active member of any party after assuming office. Every president to date, except Joachim Gauck (who was an independent), has suspended his party membership for the duration of his term. Presidents have, however, spoken publicly about their personal views on political matters. The very fact that a president is expected to remain above politics usually means that when he does speak out on an issue, it is considered to be of great importance. In some cases, a presidential speech has dominated German political debate for a year or more.[21]\n\n\n\n## Reserve powers[edit]\n\n\nAccording to article 81 of the German constitution, the president can declare a \"Legislation Emergency\" and allow the federal government and the Bundesrat to enact laws without the approval of the Bundestag. He also has important decisive power regarding the appointment of a chancellor who was elected by plurality only, or the dissolution of the Bundestag under certain circumstances.\n\n\nIt is also theoretically possible, albeit a drastic step which has not happened since 1949, that the president refuses to sign legislation merely because he disagrees with its content, thus vetoing it, or refuse to approve a cabinet appointment.[22] In all cases in which a bill was not signed by the federal president, all presidents have claimed that the bill in question was manifestly unconstitutional. For example, in the autumn of 2006, President Horst K\u00f6hler did so twice within three months. Also, in some cases, a president has signed a law while asking that the political parties refer the case to the Federal Constitutional Court in order to test the law's constitutionality.\n\n\n\n## Succession[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Manuela Schwesig, the current President of the Bundesrat and Deputy of the President of Germany\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on**Orders of succession** |\n| Presidencies |\n| * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Brazil\n* Colombia\n* China\n* DR Congo\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Ireland\n* Republic of Korea\n* Mexico\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Romania\n* Sri Lanka\n* Taiwan\n* United States\n* Uruguay\n* Vietnam\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe Basic Law did not create an office of Vice President, but designated the President of the Bundesrat (by constitutional custom the head of government of one of the sixteen German states, elected by the Bundesrat in a predetermined order of annual alternation) as deputy of the president of Germany (Basic Law, Article 57). If the office of president falls vacant, they assume the powers of the president on an acting basis until a successor is elected. While doing so, they do not continue to exercise the role of chair of the Bundesrat.[23] If the president is temporarily unable to perform his duties (this happens frequently, for example if the president is abroad on a state visit), he can at his own discretion delegate his powers or parts of them to the president of the Bundesrat.[24] For example, in early November 2022, then President of the Bundesrat Peter Tschentscher deputised President Steinmeier when the latter was on a trip to Asia.[25]\n\n\nIf the president dies in office, resigns or is otherwise removed from office, a successor is to be elected within thirty days. Horst K\u00f6hler, upon his resignation on 31 May 2010, became the first president to trigger this re-election process. Jens B\u00f6hrnsen, President of the Senate and Mayor of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen and at the time President of the Bundesrat, became Acting President.[26] Similarly, when Christian Wulff resigned in 2012, it was Horst Seehofer, Minister-President of Bavaria, as President of the Bundesrat, who became Acting President. When Heinrich L\u00fcbke, on the other hand, announced his resignation in 1968, it only came into effect the following year, a mere three months before the scheduled end of his term and after the expedited election of his successor. Back in 1949, Karl Arnold, at the time Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia and President of the Bundesrat, also acted as head of state for a few days: after the Basic Law had come into effect and he himself was elected as President of the Bundesrat, the first President of Germany was not yet elected and the office therefore vacant.\n\n\nNone of these three presidents of the Bundesrat acting as President, has used any of the more important powers of the president, as for example vetoing a law or dissolving the Bundestag, although they would have been entitled to do so under the same conditions as the president.\n\n\n\n## Impeachment and removal[edit]\n\n\nWhile in office, the president enjoys immunity from prosecution and cannot be voted out of office or recalled. The only mechanism for removing the president is impeachment by the Bundestag *or* Bundesrat for willfully violating German law. In either of the two bodies a two-thirds majority is required. Once the Bundestag or the Bundesrat impeaches the president, the Federal Constitutional Court is charged with determining if he is guilty of the offence. If the charge is sustained, the court has the authority to remove the president from office.\n\n\n\n## Presidential office and symbols[edit]\n\n\n### Residences and office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ceremonial office in Bellevue Palace\nThe official residence of the president is Bellevue Palace in Berlin. The president's second official residence is the Hammerschmidt Villa in Bonn, the former capital city of West Germany.\n\n\nAlthough these are the president's official residences, he does not live in Bellevue palace. Instead, it is only used as a ceremonial office. The president and his wife live in a villa in Dahlem which is part of the Berlin borough of Steglitz-Zehlendorf.\n\n\nThe Office of the President (*Bundespr\u00e4sidialamt*) is a supreme federal authority. It organises the president's work, supports the president in the performance of his duties as head of state and coordinates his working relationships with other parts of the German government and administration. Its top official, who takes precedence over all other German state secretaries, is the Head of the Office of the President (*Chef des Bundespr\u00e4sidialamts*).\n\n\nThe office and its staff advise the president, inform him of all developments in domestic and foreign affairs and carry out the instructions of the president or forward these to the corresponding ministry or authority.[7]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Airbus A340 aircraft used by the president\nThe president's car is usually black, made in Germany and has the numberplate \"0 \u2013 1\" with the presidential standard on the right wing of the car. The president also uses a VIP helicopter operated by the Federal Police and VIP aircraft (Bombardier Global 5000, Airbus A319CJ, Airbus A310 or A340) operated by the Executive Transport Wing of the German Air Force. When the president is on board, the flight's callsign is \"German Airforce 001\".\n\n\n\n### Presidential standard[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The standard of the president of Germany as used from 1921 to 1933 and since 1950\nThe standard of the president of Germany was adopted on 11 April 1921, and used in this design until 1933. A slightly modified version also existed from 1926, that was used in addition to the 1921 version. In 1933, these versions were both replaced by another modified version, that was used until 1935.\n\n\nThe Weimar-era presidential standard from 1921 was adopted again as presidential standard by a decision by President Theodor Heuss on 20 January 1950, when he also formally adopted other Weimar-era state symbols including the coat of arms. The eagle (*Reichsadler*, now called *Bundesadler*) in the design that was used in the coat of arms and presidential standard in the Weimar Republic and today was originally introduced by a decision by President Friedrich Ebert on 11 November 1919.\n\n\nThe standard is flown on Bellevue palace when the president is in the official residence in Berlin or travelling in another part of Germany. It is taken down only when the president resides at Villa Hammerschmidt in Bonn, if he has designated another place in Germany as his official residence, or when he is abroad.[27]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe modern-day position of German president is significantly different from the Reich President of the Weimar Republic \u2013 a position which held considerable power and was regarded as an important figure in political life.[28]\n\n\n\n### Weimar Republic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: President of Germany (1919\u20131945)\n\nThe position of President of Germany was first established by the Weimar Constitution, which was drafted in the aftermath of World War I and the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II in 1918. In Germany the new head of state was called the *Reichspr\u00e4sident*.\n\n\nFriedrich Ebert (SPD) served as Germany's first president, followed by Paul von Hindenburg. The office effectively came to an end upon Hindenburg's death in 1934 and its powers merged with those of the chancellor. Adolf Hitler now ruled Germany as \"F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler\", combining his previous positions in party and government. However, he did officially become president;[29] the office was not abolished (though the constitutionally mandated presidential elections every seven years did not take place in the Nazi era) and briefly revived at the end of the Second World War when Hitler appointed Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz as his successor as \"President of Germany\". D\u00f6nitz agreed to the surrender to the Allies and was arrested a few days later.[30]\n\n\nThe Weimar Constitution created a semi-presidential system in which power was divided between the president, a cabinet and a parliament. The president enjoyed far greater power than the current president and had an active political role, rather than a largely ceremonial one. The influence of the president also increased greatly as a result of the instability of the Weimar period. The president had authority to appoint the chancellor and could dismiss the entire cabinet at any time. However, it was also necessary for the cabinet to enjoy the confidence of the Reichstag (parliament) because it could be removed by a vote of no confidence.[31] All bills had to receive the signature of the president to become law and, although he did not have an absolute veto on legislation, he could insist that a law be submitted for the approval of voters in a referendum. The president also had authority to dissolve the Reichstag, conduct foreign affairs, and command the armed forces. Article 48 of the constitution also provided the president sweeping powers in case of a crisis. If there was a threat to \"public order and security\" he could legislate by decree and suspend civil rights.\n\n\nThe Weimar constitution provided that the president be directly elected and serve a seven-year term. The election involved a form of the two-round system. However the first president was elected by the National Assembly and subsequently only two direct presidential elections actually occurred. These were the election of Paul von Hindenburg in 1925 and his re-election in 1932.\n\n\nThe system created by the Weimar constitution led to a number of problems. In particular, the fact that the president could appoint the cabinet, while the Reichstag had only a power of dismissal, created a high cabinet turn-over as ministers were appointed by the president only to be dismissed by the Reichstag shortly afterwards. Eventually Hindenburg stopped trying to appoint cabinets that enjoyed the confidence of the Reichstag and ruled by means of three \"presidential cabinets\" (*Pr\u00e4sidialkabinette*). Hindenburg was also able to use his power of dissolution to by-pass the Reichstag. If the Reichstag threatened to censure his ministers or revoke one of his decrees he could simply dissolve the body and be able to govern without its interference until elections had been held. This led to eight Reichstag elections taking place in the 14 years of the Republic's existence; only one parliamentary term, that of 1920\u20131924, was completed without elections being held early.\n\n\n\n### German Democratic Republic (\"East Germany\")[edit]\n\n\nMain article: President of East Germany\n\nThe German Democratic Republic established the office of a head of state with the title of President of the Republic (German: *Pr\u00e4sident der Republik*) in 1949, but abandoned the office with the death of the first president, Wilhelm Pieck, in 1960 in favour of a collective head of state closely modeled on its Soviet counterpart. All government positions of the country, including the presidency, were appointed by the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany on the approval of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\nFollowing the end of communist rule due to the Peaceful Revolution, the head of state became the parliamentary speaker with new, fair elections. Later that year, a draft constitution was written that would have restored the presidency, but ultimately this never materialized.\n\n\n\n### Federal Republic of Germany (\"West Germany\", 1949\u20131990)[edit]\n\n\nWith the promulgation of the *Grundgesetz* in 1949, the office of President of the Federal Republic (in German: *Bundespr\u00e4sident*) was created in West Germany. Partly due to the misuse of presidential powers in the Weimar Republic, the office's powers were significantly reduced. Not only is he indirectly elected, but most of the real power was transferred to the chancellor.\n\n\nBecause the reunification of Germany in 1990 was accomplished by the five East German states joining the Federal Republic, the president became the president of all German states without the establishment of a new presidential office.\n\n\n\n## List of presidents[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of presidents of Germany\n\nTwelve persons have served as President of the Federal Republic of Germany. Six of them were members of the CDU (L\u00fcbke, Carstens, von Weizs\u00e4cker, Herzog, K\u00f6hler, Wulff), three were members of the SPD (Heinemann, Rau, Steinmeier), two were members of the FDP (Heuss, Scheel) and one was an Independent (Gauck). Four presidents were ministers in the federal government before entering office (L\u00fcbke *Agriculture*, Heinemann *Justice*, Scheel, Steinmeier *Foreign Affairs*), two of them (Scheel, Steinmeier) having been Vice-Chancellor of Germany. Three were head of a state government (von Weizs\u00e4cker *West Berlin*, Rau *North Rhine-Westphalia*, Wulff *Lower Saxony*), Rau having been President of the Bundesrat. Two were members of the Bundestag (Heuss, Carstens), Carstens having been President of the Bundestag. One was president of the Federal Constitutional Court (Herzog), director of the IMF (K\u00f6hler) and Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records (Gauck). Only five presidents (Heuss, L\u00fcbke, von Weizs\u00e4cker, K\u00f6hler, Steinmeier) have been re-elected for a second five-year-term and only two of those (Heuss, von Weizs\u00e4cker) served the full ten years. Christian Wulff served the shortest tenure (1 year, 7 months and 18 days) of all presidents.\n\n\nThe president is (according to Art. 57 GG) deputised by the president of the Bundesrat who can perform any of the president's duties, if the president is temporarily unable to do so and delegates these duties to them (this frequently happens during state visits), or if the Presidency falls vacant, in which case they become acting President until a successor is elected, which has to happen within thirty days. This has happened three times:\n\n\n\n* In 1949, Karl Arnold acted as President after the *Grundgesetz* came into effect on 7 September 1949 and before Theodor Heuss was elected by the 1st Federal Convention on 12 September 1949.\n* In 2010, Jens B\u00f6hrnsen acted as President after the resignation of Horst K\u00f6hler and before the election of Christian Wulff.\n* In 2012, Horst Seehofer acted as President after the resignation of Christian Wulff and before the election of Joachim Gauck.\n\n\n\n\nList of presidents of Germany from 1949 \u2013 till date.\n| No. | Portrait\n |

In that role, the president represents national unity, and guarantees that Italian politics comply with the Constitution. The president is the commander-in-chief of the Italian Armed Forces and chairs the High Council of the Judiciary. A president's term of office lasts for seven years.[2] The incumbent president is former constitutional judge Sergio Mattarella, who was elected on 31 January 2015,[3] and re-elected on 29 January 2022.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Qualifications for office[edit]\n\n\nThe framers of the Constitution of Italy intended for the president to be an elder statesman of some stature. Article 84[2] states that any Italian citizen who is fifty or older on election day and enjoys civil and political rights can be elected president. The article also states that the presidency is incompatible with any other office; therefore, the president-elect must resign any other position before being sworn in.\n\n\nThe 1948 Constitution sets the presidential term at seven years. It does not put any term limit on the presidency,[2] although until 2013 no president ever ran for a second term. On 20 April 2013, President Giorgio Napolitano agreed to run for a second term in an attempt to break the parliamentary deadlock in the 2013 presidential elections and was duly reelected the same day.[5] However, he made it clear that he would not serve his full term and resigned in January 2015.\n\n\n\n## Election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italian presidential elections\n\nThe president of the Italian Republic is elected by an electoral college of about 660 members (1,009 in the 2022 election, before the 2020 Italian constitutional referendum which reduced the number of elected parliament members). It comprises both chambers of the Italian Parliament\u2014the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic\u2014meeting in joint session, combined with 58 special electors appointed by the regional councils of the 20 regions of Italy. Three representatives come from each region (save for the Aosta Valley, which due to its small size only appoints one), so as to guarantee representation for localities and minorities. The electoral college currently consists of:\n\n\n\n* Deputies (400)\n* Senators (200 elected, plus a small and variable number of senators for life)\n* Regional representatives (58)\n\n\nAccording to the Constitution, the election must be held by a secret ballot, with the senators, deputies and regional representatives all being required to vote. A two-thirds vote is required to elect on any of the first three rounds of balloting and after that a simple majority suffices. The number of rounds has often been large thanks to the secret ballot and fragmented nature of the Italian Parliament.[6] The election is presided over by the president of the Chamber of Deputies, who calls for the public counting of the votes. The vote is held in the Palazzo Montecitorio, seat of the Chamber of Deputies, which is expanded and re-configured for the event.  \nThere is no formal personal candidacy but only proposals from groups within the electoral college or from groups of no fewer than half a million citizens, so any citizen may be voted or elected, regardless of any expressed intention to be a candidate.  \nMembers of the electoral college, mostly being part of political parties, can make public or undisclosed agreements between each other on a name to vote as candidate, but the votes during the ballot remain secret as only the candidate's name is revealed but not the voter who wrote it so it's not always clear, especially to the public, if such agreements are there and if a party or a group of voters actually comply with them during a ballot.  \nFor these reasons, during the ballots, there could be votes for public figures not related to politics (actors, singers, soccer players for example or even fictitious characters) or non feasible candidates. Those kinds of votes are not fully beyond a political strategy, considering they're secret and that the first ballots requires a larger winning majority. They may be used to express discontent about the potential actual candidates, to test or show if a candidate is willing to become president at that moment, to spoil secondary candidates in order to increase interest in main candidates for future ballots, to spoil a potential candidate of the adversary party at the first ballots or to let other parties express their more interesting candidates before a potential winning ballot.  \n\nOften a successful vote is reached when the major political parties within the chambers reached an agreement on a willing candidate before that final ballot and their members comply with such agreement during the vote.\n\n\n\n## Presidential mandate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Second inauguration of Sergio Mattarella in front of the Italian Parliament on 3 February 2022.\nThe president of the Italian Republic assumes office after taking an oath before the Italian Parliament and delivering a presidential address.\n\n\nThe term of the president of the Italian Republic lasts seven years. This prevents any officeholder from being reelected by the same houses, which have a five-year mandate, also granting some freedom from excessive political ties to the appointing body. The Italian president's term may end by voluntary resignation, death while in office, permanent disability due to serious illness, or dismissal as for crimes of high treason or an attack on the Constitution.\n\n\nA former president of the Republic is called president *emeritus* of the Republic and becomes Senator for life *ex officio*. In the absence of the president of the republic, including travel abroad, presidential functions are performed by the president of the Senate.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Legal powers[edit]\n\n\nThe Constitution lays out the duties and powers of the president of the republic, including the following:\n\n\n\n1. In foreign affairs:\n\t* Accrediting and receiving diplomatic functionaries.\n\t* Ratifying international treaties upon authorization of Parliament (if required according to Article 80 of the Constitution).\n\t* Making official visits abroad, accompanied by a member of the government.\n\t* Declaring a state of war as decided by Parliament.\n2. In parliamentary affairs:\n\t* Appointing senators for life (that may be up to five altogether).\n\t* Calling the Chambers of Parliament into extraordinary session and dissolving them.\n\t* Calling elections and fixing the date for the first meeting of the new Chambers.\n3. In legislative matters:\n\t* Authorizing the presentation of proposed governmental bills to Parliament.\n\t* Promulgating the laws approved by the Parliament.\n\t* Sending a bill back to the parliament (with an explanation) and asking for its reconsideration (only permitted once per bill).\n4. Regarding popular sovereignty.\n\t* Calling referendums.\n5. In executive matters and as to official protocol.\n\t* Appointing the prime minister of Italy and Cabinet ministers on the advice of the prime minister.\n\t* Receiving the oath of the government.\n\t* Accepting the resignation of a government.\n\t* Promulgating government decrees. Without further approval by Parliament, these measures expire after 60 days.\n\t* Appointing certain high state functionaries.\n\t* Presiding over the *Consiglio Supremo di Difesa* (Supreme Defense Council) and commanding all the armed forces.\n\t* Decreeing the dissolution of regional councils and the removal of presidents of regions.\n6. In judicial matters:\n\t* Presiding over the *Consiglio Superiore della Magistratura* (Superior Judicial Council).\n\t* Appointing 5 members (one-third) of the Constitutional Court of Italy.\n\t* Granting pardons and commutations.\n\t* Cannot be punished for acts appertaining to his office unless guilty of high treason or violation of the Constitution. (article 90 of the Italian constitution)\n\t* It is a crime to undermine his honour or prestige. (article 278 of the Italian penal code)\n7. Others:\n\t* Granting honors.\n\n\nIn practice, the president's office has little real independent authority. The Constitution provides that nearly all presidential acts must be countersigned by the prime minister or an individual minister since actual political responsibility rests with the government. Most presidential powers are only formal and must be exercised through the government, while many of the others are duties that the president is required to perform. However, pardons and commutations have been recognized as autonomous powers of the president.\n\n\nHowever, the president's role is not entirely ceremonial. For example, the president\u2019s ability to send a piece of legislation back to Parliament is not taken lightly by legislators. While the president is required to promulgate the law if it is passed a second time, in practice legislators are unlikely to ignore his objections to legislation unless the measure is critical.[7] Moreover, the president's few powers expand when there is no clear majority in Parliament. During these times, the president has significant latitude in appointing prime ministers, such as when President Scalfaro appointed Lamberto Dini as prime minister against the wishes of outgoing Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi,[7] or when President Napolitano appointed Mario Monti in 2011 and Enrico Letta in 2013.[8]\n\n\nThis latitude extends even further to cabinet appointments, as in 2018 when President Mattarella blocked the appointment of Paolo Savona to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Mattarella felt that Savona's Euroscepticism would endanger Italy's relationship with the EU; he took the line that as the guardian of the Constitution, he could not allow this to happen.[9]\n\n\n\n## Succession[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Standard of the Substitute President of the Republic\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on**Orders of succession** |\n| Presidencies |\n| * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Brazil\n* Colombia\n* China\n* DR Congo\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Ireland\n* Republic of Korea\n* Mexico\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Romania\n* Sri Lanka\n* Taiwan\n* United States\n* Uruguay\n* Vietnam\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nAccording to Article 86[2] of the Constitution, in all the cases in which the president is unable to perform the functions of the office, these shall be performed by the president of the Senate, who would temporarily serve as acting president of Italy.\n\n\nIn the event of permanent incapacity, death in office or resignation of the president, the president of the Chamber of Deputies shall call an election of a new president within fifteen days, notwithstanding the longer term envisaged during the dissolution of the Parliament or in the three months preceding dissolution.\n\n\n\n## Residence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Quirinal Palace, the principal residence of the president\nThe officeholder resides in Rome at the Quirinal Palace and also has at his disposal the presidential holdings of Castelporziano,[10] near Rome and Villa Rosebery in Naples.[11] The residence at the Quirinal is guarded by the Corazzieri, an elite cuirassier honor guard that is part of the Carabinieri and has its historical roots in the guards of the House of Savoy.[12]\n\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of presidents of Italy\n* List of presidents of Italy by time in office\n* Italian presidential elections\n* Spouses and companions of the presidents of Italy\n* *Semestre bianco*\n* Presidential standard of Italy\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** MacBeth, Alex (2 February 2012). \"Roman Austerity: Parliamentary Salary Cuts a Drop in the Bucket\". *Spiegel Online* (in Italian).
