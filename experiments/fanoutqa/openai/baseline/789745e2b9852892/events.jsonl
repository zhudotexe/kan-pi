It was directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga from a screenplay he co-wrote with Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, based on a story conceived by Purvis, Wade and Fukunaga. Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Jeffrey Wright, Christoph Waltz, Ralph Fiennes, and Rory Kinnear reprise their roles from previous films, with Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch, Billy Magnussen, Ana de Armas, David Dencik and Dali Benssalah also starring. In *No Time to Die*, Bond has left active service with MI6 and is recruited by the CIA to find a kidnapped scientist, which leads to a showdown with a powerful and vengeful adversary armed with a technology capable of killing millions. \n\n\nDevelopment on the film began in 2016. It is the first *James Bond* film to be distributed by Universal Pictures, which acquired international distribution rights following the expiration of Sony Pictures' contract after the release of *Spectre* in 2015. United Artists Releasing holds the rights for North America, as well as worldwide digital and television rights; Universal also holds the worldwide rights for physical home media. Danny Boyle was originally attached to direct and co-write the screenplay with John Hodge. Both left in August 2018 due to creative differences, and Fukunaga was announced as Boyle's replacement one month later. Most of the cast had signed by April 2019. Principal photography took place from April to October 2019. Billie Eilish performed the theme song \"No Time to Die\", while Hans Zimmer scored the film, with Steve Mazzaro serving as score producer.\n\n\nAfter being delayed by Boyle's departure and later by the COVID-19 pandemic, *No Time to Die* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 28 September 2021. It was theatrically released on 30 September 2021 in the United Kingdom and on 8 October 2021 in the United States. The film received positive reviews and grossed over $774 million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2021 and the third-highest grossing Bond film. In addition to this, it had earned several other box-office record achievements, including becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time in the UK. The film was nominated for three awards at the 94th Academy Awards, winning Best Original Song, and received numerous other accolades.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nA young Madeleine Swann witnesses the murder of her mother by Lyutsifer Safin, whose family was assassinated by Swann's father Mr. White under orders from Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Swann shoots Safin and flees, falling into a frozen lake, but Safin rescues her.\n\n\nIn the present, after Blofeld's arrest,[a] Swann travels to Matera with James Bond. She asks Bond to visit the nearby grave of his ex-lover Vesper Lynd, where he survives an explosion orchestrated by Spectre operatives led by Primo, a mercenary with a bionic eye. Bond escapes with Swann but ends their relationship, believing that she betrayed him.\n\n\nFive years later, Spectre agents extract MI6 scientist Valdo Obruchev, who is secretly working for Safin, from a laboratory in London and steal Project Heracles, a programmable DNA-targeting nanobot bioweapon developed under M's oversight. Retired and living in Jamaica, Bond is contacted by CIA ally Felix Leiter and State Department agent Logan Ash, who ask for Bond's help extracting Obruchev from a Spectre party in Cuba. Bond declines but later accepts after Nomi, his successor as Agent 007, warns him not to interfere with her own extraction of Obruchev and puts him in contact with M, who refuses to answer his questions about Heracles.\n\n\nBond infiltrates the party with Paloma, a Cuban agent assisting Leiter. Blofeld, overseeing the gathering from Belmarsh through Primo's bionic eye, disperses a nanobot mist to kill Bond. However, Obruchev reprogrammed the nanobots under Safin's orders to kill the Spectre members instead. Outmaneuvering Nomi with Paloma's help, Bond brings Obruchev to Ash and Leiter aboard a trawler. Ash, also working for Safin, shoots Leiter and traps him with Bond below deck, fleeing with Obruchev after blowing up the ship. Leiter dies of his wounds, but Bond escapes.\n\n\nBond returns to London seeking to interrogate Blofeld about Obruchev's employer, but Blofeld reportedly only speaks to his psychiatrist, Swann. Safin coerces Swann into infecting herself with a nanobot dose to assassinate Blofeld. Meeting Swann in Belmarsh, Bond unknowingly infects himself with Swann's nanobots. Swann is too scared to confront Blofeld, who reveals to Bond that he planned the explosion at Vesper's grave to make Bond believe that Swann betrayed him. Enraged, Bond briefly strangles Blofeld, unknowingly allowing the nanobots to enter his system and kill him.\n\n\nBond tracks Swann to her childhood home in Norway, where they reconcile, and he meets her five-year-old daughter Mathilde. Swann insists she is not his child and shares intelligence her father gathered about Safin and the island his family owned. The following day, MI6 alert Bond that Ash is approaching, leading to Ash and several armed thugs ambushing Bond, Mathilde and Swann, chasing them into a nearby forest. Bond orders Swann and Mathilde to hide in the forest while he confronts Ash and his forces, defeating Ash's men before killing Ash, avenging Leiter's death. While Bond is fighting Ash, Safin absconds with Swann and Mathilde.\n\n\nQ provides Bond and Nomi with a submersible glider to infiltrate Safin's headquarters, a missile base in the Sea of Japan converted into a nanobot factory. Bond and Nomi plan to rescue Swann and Mathilde before ordering a missile strike on the facility. Bond confronts Safin, who flees with Mathilde but later releases her, while Swann escapes and reunites with Bond and Mathilde. Nomi kills Obruchev by kicking him into an acid pool,[4] then escorts Swann and Mathilde off the island. Bond kills Safin's remaining men, including Primo, then stays to open the silo doors for missiles launched from HMS *Dragon* to penetrate. Bond rushes back to the control room when the silo doors begin closing, but is ambushed by Safin, who infects him with a nanobot vial programmed to kill Swann and Mathilde. Bond shoots Safin dead and reopens the silo doors, but he chooses to remain on the island and die, to keep Swann and Mathilde safe. He radios Swann to say goodbye, expressing his love for her and Mathilde, who she confirms is his daughter. The missiles destroy the facility and Bond dies in the resulting explosion.\n\n\nLater, at MI6, M, Moneypenny, Nomi, Q, and Bill Tanner drink to Bond's memory. Driving Mathilde to Matera, Swann tells her a story about a man named Bond; James Bond.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Daniel Craig as James Bond:[5]  \nA former MI6 agent who was known as 007 during his service and has been retired for five years at the start of the film.[6][7] Director Cary Joji Fukunaga compared Bond to a \"wounded animal\" and described his state of mind as \"struggling to deal with his role as a '00 agent'. The world's changed. The rules of engagement aren't what they used to be. The rules of espionage are darker in this era of asymmetric warfare\".[8] Craig stated that the film is \"about relationships and family\".[9]\n* Léa Seydoux as Dr. Madeleine Swann:[10]  \n A psychotherapist, daughter of Mr. White, and Bond's love interest who assisted him in his mission in the film *Spectre*. Fukunaga underscored Madeleine's importance to the film, as her presence allowed him to explore Bond's unresolved trauma stemming from the death of Vesper Lynd in *Casino Royale*.[11] After seeing the film, Seydoux said: \"There's a lot of emotion in this *Bond*. It's very moving. I bet you're going to cry. When I watched it, I cried, which is weird because I am in it.\"[12]\n* Rami Malek as Lyutsifer Safin:[13]  \nA facially disfigured terrorist and scientist on a revenge mission against Spectre who later becomes Bond's adversary.[14][15] Producer Barbara Broccoli described the character as \"the one that really gets under Bond's skin. He's a nasty piece of work.\"[14] Malek described the character as someone who considers \"himself as a hero almost in the same way that Bond is a hero\".[16][17] Fukunaga described Safin as \"more dangerous than anyone [Bond has] ever encountered\" and a \"hyper-intelligent and worthy adversary\".[18][19]\n* Lashana Lynch as Nomi:[20]  \nA new \"00\" agent who entered active service some time after Bond's retirement and was assigned the 007 number.[21][22] Lynch hoped that her character would bring a new layer of relatability to the world of espionage, saying \"When you're dealing with a franchise that has been slick for so many years, I wanted to throw a human spin on it—to deal with anxiety and be someone who's figuring it out, completely on her toes\".[23]\n* Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory / M:[10] Head of MI6 and Bond's superior officer.\n* Ben Whishaw as Q:[10]  \nMI6's Quartermaster who outfits \"00\" agents with equipment for use in the field. In the film, Q is revealed to be gay when Moneypenny and Bond interrupt him planning a dinner date with another man.[24][25][26][27] Whishaw considers his version of Q to have ended, saying: \"I think I'm done now. I've done the three that I was ... contracted to do. So I think that might be it for me.\"[28]\n* Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny:[10]  \nM's secretary and Bond's ally. Harris says since *Spectre*, \"Moneypenny has grown up somewhat. I think she still has her soft spot for Bond though, that's never going to go. But she's an independent woman with her own life\".[29]\n* Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter:[30]  \nBond's friend and a CIA field officer. Wright was asked what can be expected from Felix in the film, to which he replied, \"Well, I think it's known that Felix pulls James back into the game and away we go from there\".[31] While Wright was surprised he was not asked to return in *Skyfall* and *Spectre*, he felt Felix's return in *No Time to Die* \"gives more weight\" due to his prior absence. Wright said that the film establishes the brotherhood of Bond and Felix, which he described as the \"core\" of their relationship.[32]\n* Billy Magnussen as Logan Ash: A CIA agent assigned by Leiter to support Bond in finding Obruchev.[33] Ash is later revealed to be a double agent working for Safin.\n* Christoph Waltz as Ernst Stavro Blofeld:[22]  \nBond's arch-enemy and foster brother. He is the founder and head of the criminal syndicate Spectre and is now in MI6 custody. Fukunaga explained why Blofeld returns and teased the character's \"new role\" in the film by saying: \"Blofeld is an iconic character in all the *Bond* films. He's in prison, but he certainly can't be done yet, right? So what could he be doing from in there and what nefarious, sadistic things does he have planned for James Bond and the rest of the world?\"[34]\n* David Dencik as Dr. Valdo Obruchev: A rogue scientist who created Project Heracles.[35]\n* Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner: M's chief of staff.[36]\n* Ana de Armas as Paloma: A CIA agent assisting Bond.[22] De Armas described her character as \"irresponsible\" and \"bubbly\" and playing a key role in Bond's mission.[37]\n* Dali Benssalah as Primo: A mercenary and an adversary whom Bond first encounters in Matera.[38]\n* Lisa-Dorah Sonnet as Mathilde: The five-year-old daughter of James Bond and Madeleine Swann.[39]\n\n\nAdditionally, Hugh Dennis and Priyanga Burford portray scientists working at an MI6 laboratory.[40] Mathilde Bourbin and Coline Defaud appear as Madeleine Swann's mother and young Madeleine respectively in the film's opening sequence.[41][42] Brigitte Millar also reprises her role as Spectre chief Dr. Vogel from *Spectre*.[43]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph of director Cary Joji Fukunaga at the UK premiere of television miniseries Maniac](image)Cary Joji Fukunaga, director of *No Time to Die*\nDevelopment of *No Time to Die* began in early 2016.[44] In March 2017, screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade—who have worked on every *Bond* film since *The World Is Not Enough* (1999)—were approached to write the script by producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson.[45] Purvis and Wade mapped out the story for the film in 2017.[46] Sam Mendes stated that he would not return after directing *Skyfall* and *Spectre*.[47] Christopher Nolan ruled himself out to direct.[48] By July 2017, Yann Demange, David Mackenzie and Denis Villeneuve were courted to direct.[49] In December 2017, Villeneuve decided against the role due to his commitments to *Dune*.[50]\n\n\nIn February 2018, Danny Boyle was established as frontrunner for the directing position.[51] Boyle's original pitch to Broccoli and Wilson saw John Hodge writing a screenplay based on Boyle's idea with Purvis and Wade's version scrapped.[52] Hodge's draft was greenlit, and Boyle was confirmed to direct with a production start date of December 2018.[53] However, Boyle and Hodge left in August 2018 due to creative differences.[54] It was reported at the time that Boyle's exit was due to the casting of Tomasz Kot as the lead villain; however, Boyle later confirmed the dispute was over the script.[55][56] The release date became contingent on whether the studio could find a replacement for Boyle within sixty days.[57][58] Cary Joji Fukunaga was announced as the new director in September 2018.[59][60] Fukunaga became the first American to direct an Eon Productions *Bond* film and the first director to receive a writing credit for any version.[61][b] Fukunaga had been considered for *Spectre* before Mendes was hired, and afterwards had expressed an interest to Broccoli and Wilson about directing a future *Bond* film.[64] Linus Sandgren was hired as cinematographer in December 2018.[65]\n\n\nPurvis and Wade were brought back to start working on a new script with Fukunaga in September 2018.[64][66] *Casino Royale* and *Quantum of Solace* screenwriter Paul Haggis turned in an uncredited rewrite in November 2018,[67] with Scott Z. Burns doing the same in February 2019.[68] At Daniel Craig's request, Phoebe Waller-Bridge provided a script polish in April 2019.[69] Waller-Bridge is the second female screenwriter credited with writing a *Bond* film after Johanna Harwood co-wrote *Dr. No* and *From Russia with Love*.[70][c] Barbara Broccoli was questioned about the MeToo movement at the *Bond 25* launch event, where she stated that Bond's attitude towards women would move with the times and the films should reflect that.[70] In a separate interview, Waller-Bridge argued that Bond was still relevant and that \"he needs to be true to this character\", instead suggesting that it was the films which had to grow and evolve, emphasising \"the important thing is that the film treats the women properly\".[64][73]\n\n\nSome concepts changed during development with Fukunaga. An early unrealised idea he considered was to have seen the film take place \"inside Bond's head\", while being tortured by Blofeld in *Spectre*, up until the end of act two of a three-act structure.[74] Originally, Safin, the villain, and his henchman would wear masks based on Siberian bear-hunting armour. The henchman character was written out before filming, and Fukunaga requested changes to Safin's costume. A new mask based on Noh, a Japanese style of theatre, was introduced as Fukunaga felt that the original mask was dominating the costume.[75]\n\n\nPaloma's costume, a navy Michael Lo Sordo gown, was chosen by costume designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb to enable the character to fight alongside Bond while still being dressed elegantly and formally for the black tie event in the plot.[76]\n\n\nThe film entered production under the working title of *Bond 25*. The title *No Time to Die* was announced on 20 August 2019.[77][d] Broccoli said: \"We were struggling to find a title. We wanted a title that wouldn't give away anything but would be understandable, and after you see the movie, have a deeper resonance, because that's often what Fleming titles are all about.\"[83]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nWhen Boyle was hired, he pitched the film to take place in present-day Russia and explore Bond's origins; he left the production after Broccoli and Wilson \"lost confidence\" in the idea.[84] During Boyle's time, a leaked casting sheet described the male leading role as a \"cold and charismatic Russian\" and the female leading role as a \"witty and skillful survivor\". Production also sought male supporting roles of Māori descent with \"advanced combat skills\".[85] The idea of Bond having a child was introduced by Hodge and retained for the final script.[84]\n\n\nWaller-Bridge was hired to revise dialogue, work on character development and add humour to the script.[86] The character of Paloma was made more significant from originally being a simple contact; Purvis and Wade indicated this was probably written by Waller-Bridge at Fukunaga's request.[46]\n\n\n*No Time to Die* is the first Eon-produced film in which Bond actually dies. Craig first proposed killing Bond in 2006, after the premiere of *Casino Royale*; Broccoli agreed to the suggestion. Craig said, \"It's the only way I could see for myself to end it all and to make it like that was my tenure, someone else could come and take over ... When he [Craig's Bond] goes, he can't come back.\"[87] Wilson said it was \"the fitting way to deal with a situation where a person is risking their life all the time. Eventually, the odds catch up with you.\"[87] The production team considered several ways for Bond to die, including being shot by an anonymous shooter. However, Fukunaga said that a \"conventional weapons death\" felt inappropriate considering that Bond had been able to \"escape from everything else\". Craig said the team tried to create a sense of tragedy and weight by using Safin's bioweapon, which killed \"the only thing that Bond wants in life ... to be with the people he loves\".[87]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nAfter *Spectre*, there was speculation that it would be Craig's final *Bond* film. Immediately after the film's release, Craig had complained about the rigours of performing the part, saying he would rather \"slash [his] wrists\" than play Bond again.[88] In May 2016, it was reported that Craig had received a $100 million offer from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to do two more *Bond* films, but turned it down.[89] In October 2016, Craig denied having made a decision but praised his time in the role, describing it as \"the best job in the world doing Bond\". He further denied that $150 million was offered to him for the next two instalments.[90] Eventually, Craig was paid $25 million for his involvement.[91] In August 2017, on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*, Craig said that the next film would mark his final appearance as Bond.[5][92] His position was reaffirmed between November 2019 and March 2020.[93][94] Craig later acknowledged that the physicality of the part had deterred him from returning to the role, having sustained injuries shooting earlier *Bond* films.[95][96][97] Craig was also drawn by the similarities to *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*. Craig said of *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*,[98]\n\n\n\n\n> It's one of the best movies because it had a love story. And what is life without love? I kind of lifted from Fleming Bond's ambiguity, conflict and passions.You could take 1952 passions or you could just transpose them to modern passions. And that's what I did. He loves, he cares, he’s honourable, he’s incorruptible and I love that he's a complex character\n> \n> — Daniel Craig, *The Guardian*[98]\n> \n\n\nWith Craig's departure, Broccoli said that *No Time to Die* would \"tie up loose narrative threads\" from Craig's previous *Bond* films and \"come to an emotionally satisfying conclusion\".[64]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Fukunaga said that Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris and Ralph Fiennes would all be reprising their roles in the film.[10] Fukunaga also said that Léa Seydoux would be reprising her role as Madeleine Swann, making her the first female lead to appear in successive *Bond* films.[10] Rory Kinnear returns as Bill Tanner, as does Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter.[30] Wright makes his third appearance in the series after *Casino Royale* and *Quantum of Solace* and becomes the first actor to play Leiter three times.[99] Ana de Armas, Dali Benssalah, David Dencik, Lashana Lynch, Billy Magnussen and Rami Malek were announced as cast members in a live stream, at Ian Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. The event was on 25 April 2019 and marked the official start of production.[30][100] The film is the second to unite de Armas with Craig, after *Knives Out* (filmed in 2018).[101] Malek was further announced as playing Safin, the film's villain,[102] but the actor revealed in an interview that his character would not be connected to any religion or ideology.[103]\n\n\nAfter the release of *Spectre* it was reported that Christoph Waltz had signed on to return as Blofeld for further *Bond* films, on the condition that Craig returned as Bond.[104] Despite Craig's definite casting as Bond, Waltz announced in October 2017 that he would not return as Blofeld, but did not give a reason for his departure.[105] Waltz's casting as Blofeld in *No Time to Die* was not announced at the press launch but was revealed in the trailer in December 2019.[106][107]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nFilming began at Langvann Lake, Norway, the backdrop for Madeleine's childhood home[108]\n![Photograph of Ponte Viadotto-Acquedotto Madonna della Stella, Italy](image)\nPonte Viadotto-Acquedotto Madonna della Stella, Gravina di Puglia, used in the bridge stunt[109]\n![Photograph of a winding road on the disputed island of Kalsoy](image)\nKalsoy serves as the disputed island that is Safin's base; its sets were inspired by those of Ken Adam and the buildings of Tadao Ando[110][111]\n\nProduction was scheduled to begin on 3 December 2018 at Pinewood Studios,[112] but filming was delayed until April 2019 after Boyle's departure.[60][113] The film is the first in the series to have sequences shot with 65mm IMAX film cameras.[114] Fukunaga and Sandgren pushed for using film over digital to enhance the look of the film.[64] The budget was reported to be between $250 million and $301 million,[3][115][116] while B25 Limited, Eon's subsidiary company created for the film's production, reported a total production cost of £214 million.[117]\n\n\nFilming locations included Italy, Jamaica, Norway, the Faroe Islands and London, in addition to Pinewood Studios.[118][119] In March 2019, production started in Nittedal, Norway, with the second unit capturing scenes on a frozen lake.[120][121] On 28 April 2019, principal photography officially began in Jamaica, including Port Antonio.[122][119] In May 2019, Craig sustained an ankle injury while filming in Jamaica and subsequently underwent minor surgery.[123] In June 2019, production was further interrupted when a controlled explosion damaged the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios and left a crew member with minor injuries.[124] Also in June 2019, production went back to Norway to shoot a driving sequence along the Atlantic Ocean Road featuring an Aston Martin V8 Vantage.[125][126] Aston Martin also confirmed that the DB5, DBS Superleggera, and Valhalla models would feature in the film.[127]\n\n\nProduction then moved to the UK. Scenes featuring Craig, Fiennes, Harris and Kinnear were filmed around London, including Whitehall, Senate House and Hammersmith.[128][129][130] In July 2019, filming took place in the town of Aviemore and in the surrounding Cairngorms National Park area.[131][132][133] Some scenes were also shot at the Ardverikie House Estate and on the banks of Loch Laggan, just outside the park.[134] The forest scene was filmed in Buttersteep Forest in Windsor Great Park.[135] In late August 2019, the second unit moved to southern Italy where they began to shoot a chase sequence involving an Aston Martin DB5 through the streets of Matera, including a doughnut in Piazza San Giovanni Battista.[136] In early September 2019, the main production unit, Craig and Léa Seydoux arrived to film scenes inside several production-built sets, as well as further sequences in Maratea and Gravina in Puglia.[137][138] Scenes were shot in the town of Sapri in southern Italy throughout September. Locations included the town's \"midnight canal\" and railway station. The city is referred to as \"Civita Lucana\" in the film.[139] In late September 2019, scenes were filmed in the Faroe Islands.[140]\n\n\nThe Ministry of Defence confirmed that filming took place around the Royal Navy destroyer HMS *Dragon* and a Royal Air Force C-17 aircraft, at RAF Brize Norton.[141][142][e] No weapons were fired.[143] The British Army's Household Cavalry unit was also filmed.[144] Filming of an action sequence with a seaplane took place at CMA CGM’s Kingston Container Terminal in Jamaica.[145][146] Whishaw praised Fukunaga's directing work, saying \"It was great and you know what was amazing is that he treated it, or was able to approach it, it felt to me almost as if it were an independent film. You know? And it was quite improvisational... we didn't do many takes\". He added, \"It was very light. Sometimes quite chaotic, but I'm very excited to see how he's constructed the final film\".[147]\nPrincipal photography wrapped up on 25 October 2019 at Pinewood Studios with the filming of a chase sequence set in Havana, Cuba.[148] Production had intended to shoot the sequence earlier, but was forced to reschedule when Craig injured his ankle in Jamaica.[97] Further pick-up shots at Pinewood were confirmed by Fukunaga on 20 December 2019.[149][150]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nVisual effects for *No Time to Die* were created by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Framestore, DNEG, and Cinesite.[151] Charlie Noble was the visual effects supervisor.[152] Post-production concluded without further changes, as the film's release date was delayed.[153]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: No Time to Die (soundtrack)\n\n![Composer Hans Zimmer](image)\n![Singer Billie Eilish](image)\nHans Zimmer (left) composed the film's score and Billie Eilish (right) performed the theme song.\n\nIn July 2019, Dan Romer was announced as composer for the film's score, having previously worked with Fukunaga on *Beasts of No Nation* and *Maniac*.[154] Romer left the film due to creative differences in November 2019.[155] Hans Zimmer replaced Romer by January 2020.[156] It is the first time in the *Bond* series history that a composer has been replaced during post-production, and the second major personnel change for the film after Boyle's departure.[157] Steve Mazzaro produced the score, while Johnny Marr played guitar. The *No Time to Die* score album was set to be released through Decca Records in March 2020 but was delayed to 1 October 2021 to coincide with the release of the film.[158][159]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Billie Eilish was announced as the performer of the film's theme song, with her brother, Finneas O'Connell, serving as co-writer as well as the track's producer. The song, which has the same title, was released on 13 February 2020.[160] At the age of 18, Eilish is the youngest artist to record a Bond theme song.[161][162] The song's music video was subsequently released on 1 October 2020.[163] Despite the film's delay, the song was nominated for and won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, on 14 March 2021, six months before the film's release date, because the song itself was released during the 2019–20 eligibility period, in anticipation of the film's original April 2020 release date.[164]\n\n\nThe song \"Dans la ville endormie\" by French singer Dalida is heard briefly in the opening scene.[165][166] Louis Armstrong's version of \"We Have All the Time in the World\" is a recurring theme included three times within the score and originally appeared in *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*, recalling both love and loss experienced by Bond following a similar poignancy in this film.[167] The track is played in full during the closing credits.[168]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Distribution rights[edit]\n\n\nThe Sony Pictures contract to co-produce the *Bond* films with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Eon Productions expired with the release of *Spectre* in 2015.[169] In April 2017, Sony Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures, and Annapurna Pictures entered a bidding competition to win the distribution rights.[170] MGM secured the North American, digital, and worldwide television rights to the film through its distribution arm United Artists Releasing.[171][172] Universal became the international distributor and worldwide holder of the rights for physical home media (DVD and Blu-ray) through its subsidiary Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, prior to its joint venture agreement in January 2020 with Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.[171][173][f]\n\n\n\n### Theatrical release and postponements[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema\n\n*No Time to Die* had its world premiere at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 28 September 2021, and was released in cinemas on 30 September 2021 in the UK and on 8 October 2021 in the US in 2D, RealD 3D, 4DX, ScreenX, Dolby Cinema and IMAX.[175][176] The film also opened the same week in September in South Korea and the following week in October in Brazil, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Russia. China and Australia would see the release later in October and November 2021. The film had the highest box office opening weekend takings in the UK for any *Bond* feature.[177][178]\n\n\n*No Time to Die* was originally scheduled for release in November 2019, but was postponed to February 2020 and then to April 2020 after Boyle's departure.[53][60][g] The premiere in China and a countrywide publicity tour, planned for April 2020, were cancelled due to the early outbreak of COVID-19 in the country.[181] By March 2020, the global spread of the virus and the declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization prompted a joint open letter from two *Bond* fan sites addressed to the producers. The letter asked that the release be delayed to minimise the risk of spreading the disease and to ensure the film's commercial success.[182][183] On 4 March 2020, MGM and Eon Productions announced that after \"thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace\" they had postponed the release until 12 November 2020 in the UK and 25 November 2020 in the US.[184][185][h] *No Time to Die* was the first major film affected by the pandemic.[179] According to *Deadline Hollywood*, MGM and Universal needed to assure a strong performance across all international markets. It was hoped that the rescheduling to November would ensure all cinemas, particularly those in China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, and France that were closed due to the pandemic, would be open and operational.[179]\n\n\nIn the early stages of the pandemic, an estimated 70,000 cinemas in China closed, and countries including Australia and the UK closed cinemas to minimise the spread of the virus.[186][187][188] *Variety* said the studio had already spent $66 million on promoting the film, while *The Hollywood Reporter* wrote that the delay cost MGM $30–50 million in wasted marketing costs, estimating that the global box office losses could have exceeded $300 million had the film stayed in its April 2020 slot.[116][189] In October 2020, *No Time to Die* was delayed again to 2 April 2021.[190] The decision to delay the release was made when it became apparent that theatrical markets, especially in the US, would not see full demand. After the delay was announced, the British chain Cineworld, the world's second-largest cinema chain, closed its cinemas indefinitely.[191] Chief executive Mooky Greidinger said the delay of *No Time to Die* was the \"last straw\" for Cineworld following a string of other film delays and cancellations.[192]\n\n\nIn January 2021, the film was rescheduled to 8 October 2021.[193] In February 2021, an earlier release date of 30 September 2021 was announced for the UK.[194] In August 2021, it was announced that the release date in Australia was delayed from 30 September to 11 November 2021, in response to their national lockdowns.[195][196] It was also screened at the Zurich Film Festival on the same day as the world premiere and the first *Bond* film to be in the official selection at a festival.[197] The release in China was on 29 October 2021.[198]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment released *No Time to Die* on DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray in the UK on 20 December 2021 and in the US on 21 December 2021.[199][200] It was available from digital download services on 9 November 2021 in the US.[201] The 31-day theatrical release window of the film is considered a relatively quick turnaround for a film of this size. One factor has been that *Bond* films attract an older audience and that demographic has been hesitant to return to cinemas during the pandemic.[202][203]\n\n\n*No Time to Die* was the top-ranking film on Vudu and Google Play for two weeks and iTunes for five weeks.[204][205][206][207][208] In the UK, it was the highest-selling digital title of 2021, with more than 430,000 units sold.[209] Upon its release in disc format, *No Time to Die* debuted atop the \"NPD VideoScan First Alert\" chart for both the overall disc sales and Blu-ray sales in the US.[210] According to *The Numbers*, it sold a combined 380,902 Blu-ray and DVD units in the first week for a revenue of $9.7 million.[3] It was the top-selling-title on both charts for three weeks.[211] It also debuted at the first position on Redbox's disc rental charts and second on its digital charts.[212] According to the NPD Group, it sold the eighth-highest amount of DVDs and Blu-rays in 2021, and the second-highest in December 2021.[213]\n\n\nIn the UK, it ranked atop the Official Film Chart for three weeks. The film was the highest-selling title on disc in the country during 2021 with 1.15 million units being sold, including 717,500 DVD and Blu-ray units being sold within two weeks. It was also the highest-selling Blu-ray title of 2021 with 237,000 units sold, in addition to becoming the highest-selling title on 4K Blu-ray in the first week of release and selling the highest number of discs for any title in first week of release since 2017 with 621,000 Blu-ray and DVDs being sold. In addition, it sold a combined 780,000 units across digital platforms and retail in the final week of 2021.[214][215][209][216]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*No Time to Die* grossed $160.9 million in the United States and Canada and $613.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $774.2 million.[2][3] It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2021.[217] Because of the combined production and promotional costs of at least $350 million, it was estimated that the film would have needed to gross at least $800 million worldwide in order to break even.[218][219]\n\n\n*No Time to Die*'s opening weekend set a $119.1 million box office from 54 countries, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico and Spain, besting its $90 million projections. It was the first film since the COVID-19 pandemic that crossed $100 million in an overseas debut without the China market.[220][221] *The Hollywood Reporter* stated the premiere was the biggest in the United Kingdom since the pandemic began.[222] In the United States and Canada, *No Time to Die* was projected to gross $65–85 million in its opening weekend.[223] The film made $23.3 million on its first day, including $6.3 million from Thursday night previews (which included $1 million from Wednesday previews), the best total of the franchise. It went on to debut to $55.2 million,[224][225] topping the box office and marking the fourth-best opening weekend of the franchise.[218] *No Time to Die* earned an additional $6.9 million on Columbus Day, bringing its four-day total in the United States and Canada to $62.2 million.[226][227] *Deadline Hollywood* attributed the slight underperformance to the film's 163-minute runtime limiting the number of showtimes.[226] *TheWrap* said that the opening was good news for cinemas, even if the studio did not break even during the film's theatrical run, and that it was an encouraging sign for upcoming adult-oriented pictures.[219] The film fell 56% in its second weekend to $24.3 million, finishing second behind newcomer *Halloween Kills*.[228] *No Time to Die* was re-released in IMAX for the weekend ending on 23 January 2022 as part of the 60th anniversary of the *Bond* film series.[229]\n\n\n*No Time to Die* became the highest-grossing film of 2021 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, surpassing *F9* on 17 October.[230] In China, the film opened to a $28.2 million weekend, displacing *The Battle at Lake Changjin* from the top rank on the country's box office, despite 13% of cinemas being closed due to China's policies against local COVID-19 outbreaks.[231] It remained atop the box office charts during its second weekend despite a drop of 59%, earning $11.4 million for a cumulative total of $49.2 million according to Artisan Gateway.[232] It became the highest-grossing non-Chinese film of 2021 outside the United States and Canada on 14 November, earning an estimated $24 million for a cume of $558.2 million, which included $126 million in the United Kingdom, $70 million in Germany and $57.9 million in China. It also opened to an $8.2 million weekend in Australia, which was the biggest opening for any film since December 2019.[233]\n\n\nDuring the weekend of 19–21 November, *No Time to Die* overtook *F9* to become the highest-grossing non-Chinese film of 2021, reaching a global cume of around $734 million as it grossed an estimated $2.6 million in the United States and Canada, as well as $13.4 million from 72 countries outside the two territories.[234][235] It overtook *Spectre* the following weekend to become the third-highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom as well as the second-highest-grossing *Bond* film in the market with a gross of $129.9 million.[236]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*No Time to Die* has an approval rating of 83% based on 425 reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The critics consensus states: \"It isn't the sleekest or most daring 007 adventure, but *No Time to Die* concludes Daniel Craig's franchise tenure in satisfying style.\"[237] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 67 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[238] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an 83% positive score, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend it.[226]\n\n\n\n![Photograph of UN Global Advocate Daniel Craig beside UN Secretary-General António Guterres, UNMAS Director Agnès Marcaillou, cropped to show only Craig](image)Daniel Craig was praised for his final portrayal of James Bond[239]\nThe film received praise from many film critics.[240] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* called it \"an epic barnstormer\" delivered \"with terrific panache\" and with \"pathos, action, drama, camp comedy, heartbreak, macabre horror, and outrageously silly old-fashioned action\".[241] Robbie Collin of *The Daily Telegraph* described it as \"extravagantly satisfying\", \"often very funny\" with gadgets \"both improbable and outrageous\", and that it has been filmed with \"gorgeous\" cinematography, starting with \"a sensationally thrilling and sinister prologue\" and ending with a \"moving conclusion\".[242] Kevin Maher of *The Times* wrote: \"It's better than good. It's magnificent\";[243] he later named the film one of the best films of 2021.[244]\n\n\nBarry Hertz of *The Globe and Mail* wrote that the film \"makes sure that my eyes are following each and every oh-whoa stunt. As well as guaranteeing that I actually care about whether (or, really, how) Bond gets out of this one.\"[245] Mick LaSalle of the *San Francisco Chronicle* wrote that the film \"takes its place among the best of the entire series\", and concluded \"Craig leaves the series in a mammoth, 163-minute extravaganza that audiences will be enjoying for decades. It's a lovely thing to see.\"[246] K. Austin Collins of *Rolling Stone* described the film as being \"just fine: sometimes intriguing, sometimes not, sometimes boring, sometimes not\", adding: \"It's a bit more successful if we think of it instead as a tribute to the Craig era, and to the star himself.\"[247]\n\n\nMichael O'Sullivan of *The Washington Post* gave the film three out of four stars, writing that it was \"a bit too long and a bit too complicated\", but added that it was \"also a fittingly complicated and ultimately perversely satisfying send-off for the actor\".[248] Peter Rainer of *The Christian Science Monitor* gave the film three out of five stars, writing: \"It offers up the requisite thrills, stunts, and bad guys. Beautiful people abound, and 007 still knows how to fill out a tux.\" However, he questioned \"Has James Bond become irrelevant?\"[249]\n\n\nConversely, some critics found fault with the film. John Nugent of *Empire* criticised its length (2 hours and 43 minutes), asserting that the plotting and exposition in the middle third \"doesn't justify that heaving runtime\". Nevertheless, he thought the film \"a fitting end to the Craig era\".[250] Kyle Smith of *National Review* also criticised the film's length, and described it as \"the least fun and most somber excursion in the entire Bond series\".[251] Clarisse Loughrey of *The Independent* found it uneventful and disappointing: its core premise of a biological weapon of mass destruction was described as \"generic spy nonsense\", while she felt that Rami Malek \"gives almost nothing to the role beyond his accent and stereotyped disfigurement makeup\".[252]\n\n\nDavid Sexton of *New Statesman* wrote that the film \"shows signs of emerging from an over-deliberated, market-sensitised production process\", adding: \"It delivers the set-pieces without ever trying to connect them with any urgency, almost like an anthology or re-mix.\"[253] Brian Tallerico of *RogerEbert.com* gave the film a score of two out of four stars, writing: \"For something that once felt like it so deftly balanced the old of a timeless character with a new, richer style, perhaps the biggest knock against [the film] is that there's nothing here that hasn't been done better in one of the other Craig movies.\"[254]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by No Time to Die\n\nAt the 94th Academy Awards, *No Time to Die* received nominations for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects, and won Best Original Song,[255] becoming the third film to do so after *Skyfall* and *Spectre*.[256] The film's other nominations include five British Academy Film Awards (winning one),[257] two Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning one),[258] and a Golden Globe Award (which it won).[259]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of James Bond\n* Production of the James Bond films\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As depicted in *Spectre* (2015)\n2. **^** The American directors John Huston and Robert Parrish were two of five directors who worked on the 1967 adaptation of *Casino Royale*, and Irvin Kershner directed the 1983 film *Never Say Never Again*.

It was directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga from a screenplay he co-wrote with Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, based on a story conceived by Purvis, Wade and Fukunaga. Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Jeffrey Wright, Christoph Waltz, Ralph Fiennes, and Rory Kinnear reprise their roles from previous films, with Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch, Billy Magnussen, Ana de Armas, David Dencik and Dali Benssalah also starring. In *No Time to Die*, Bond has left active service with MI6 and is recruited by the CIA to find a kidnapped scientist, which leads to a showdown with a powerful and vengeful adversary armed with a technology capable of killing millions. \n\n\nDevelopment on the film began in 2016. It is the first *James Bond* film to be distributed by Universal Pictures, which acquired international distribution rights following the expiration of Sony Pictures' contract after the release of *Spectre* in 2015. United Artists Releasing holds the rights for North America, as well as worldwide digital and television rights; Universal also holds the worldwide rights for physical home media. Danny Boyle was originally attached to direct and co-write the screenplay with John Hodge. Both left in August 2018 due to creative differences, and Fukunaga was announced as Boyle's replacement one month later. Most of the cast had signed by April 2019. Principal photography took place from April to October 2019. Billie Eilish performed the theme song \"No Time to Die\", while Hans Zimmer scored the film, with Steve Mazzaro serving as score producer.\n\n\nAfter being delayed by Boyle's departure and later by the COVID-19 pandemic, *No Time to Die* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 28 September 2021. It was theatrically released on 30 September 2021 in the United Kingdom and on 8 October 2021 in the United States. The film received positive reviews and grossed over $774 million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2021 and the third-highest grossing Bond film. In addition to this, it had earned several other box-office record achievements, including becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time in the UK. The film was nominated for three awards at the 94th Academy Awards, winning Best Original Song, and received numerous other accolades.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nA young Madeleine Swann witnesses the murder of her mother by Lyutsifer Safin, whose family was assassinated by Swann's father Mr. White under orders from Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Swann shoots Safin and flees, falling into a frozen lake, but Safin rescues her.\n\n\nIn the present, after Blofeld's arrest,[a] Swann travels to Matera with James Bond. She asks Bond to visit the nearby grave of his ex-lover Vesper Lynd, where he survives an explosion orchestrated by Spectre operatives led by Primo, a mercenary with a bionic eye. Bond escapes with Swann but ends their relationship, believing that she betrayed him.\n\n\nFive years later, Spectre agents extract MI6 scientist Valdo Obruchev, who is secretly working for Safin, from a laboratory in London and steal Project Heracles, a programmable DNA-targeting nanobot bioweapon developed under M's oversight. Retired and living in Jamaica, Bond is contacted by CIA ally Felix Leiter and State Department agent Logan Ash, who ask for Bond's help extracting Obruchev from a Spectre party in Cuba. Bond declines but later accepts after Nomi, his successor as Agent 007, warns him not to interfere with her own extraction of Obruchev and puts him in contact with M, who refuses to answer his questions about Heracles.\n\n\nBond infiltrates the party with Paloma, a Cuban agent assisting Leiter. Blofeld, overseeing the gathering from Belmarsh through Primo's bionic eye, disperses a nanobot mist to kill Bond. However, Obruchev reprogrammed the nanobots under Safin's orders to kill the Spectre members instead. Outmaneuvering Nomi with Paloma's help, Bond brings Obruchev to Ash and Leiter aboard a trawler. Ash, also working for Safin, shoots Leiter and traps him with Bond below deck, fleeing with Obruchev after blowing up the ship. Leiter dies of his wounds, but Bond escapes.\n\n\nBond returns to London seeking to interrogate Blofeld about Obruchev's employer, but Blofeld reportedly only speaks to his psychiatrist, Swann. Safin coerces Swann into infecting herself with a nanobot dose to assassinate Blofeld. Meeting Swann in Belmarsh, Bond unknowingly infects himself with Swann's nanobots. Swann is too scared to confront Blofeld, who reveals to Bond that he planned the explosion at Vesper's grave to make Bond believe that Swann betrayed him. Enraged, Bond briefly strangles Blofeld, unknowingly allowing the nanobots to enter his system and kill him.\n\n\nBond tracks Swann to her childhood home in Norway, where they reconcile, and he meets her five-year-old daughter Mathilde. Swann insists she is not his child and shares intelligence her father gathered about Safin and the island his family owned. The following day, MI6 alert Bond that Ash is approaching, leading to Ash and several armed thugs ambushing Bond, Mathilde and Swann, chasing them into a nearby forest. Bond orders Swann and Mathilde to hide in the forest while he confronts Ash and his forces, defeating Ash's men before killing Ash, avenging Leiter's death. While Bond is fighting Ash, Safin absconds with Swann and Mathilde.\n\n\nQ provides Bond and Nomi with a submersible glider to infiltrate Safin's headquarters, a missile base in the Sea of Japan converted into a nanobot factory. Bond and Nomi plan to rescue Swann and Mathilde before ordering a missile strike on the facility. Bond confronts Safin, who flees with Mathilde but later releases her, while Swann escapes and reunites with Bond and Mathilde. Nomi kills Obruchev by kicking him into an acid pool,[4] then escorts Swann and Mathilde off the island. Bond kills Safin's remaining men, including Primo, then stays to open the silo doors for missiles launched from HMS *Dragon* to penetrate. Bond rushes back to the control room when the silo doors begin closing, but is ambushed by Safin, who infects him with a nanobot vial programmed to kill Swann and Mathilde. Bond shoots Safin dead and reopens the silo doors, but he chooses to remain on the island and die, to keep Swann and Mathilde safe. He radios Swann to say goodbye, expressing his love for her and Mathilde, who she confirms is his daughter. The missiles destroy the facility and Bond dies in the resulting explosion.\n\n\nLater, at MI6, M, Moneypenny, Nomi, Q, and Bill Tanner drink to Bond's memory. Driving Mathilde to Matera, Swann tells her a story about a man named Bond; James Bond.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Daniel Craig as James Bond:[5]  \nA former MI6 agent who was known as 007 during his service and has been retired for five years at the start of the film.[6][7] Director Cary Joji Fukunaga compared Bond to a \"wounded animal\" and described his state of mind as \"struggling to deal with his role as a '00 agent'. The world's changed. The rules of engagement aren't what they used to be. The rules of espionage are darker in this era of asymmetric warfare\".[8] Craig stated that the film is \"about relationships and family\".[9]\n* Léa Seydoux as Dr. Madeleine Swann:[10]  \n A psychotherapist, daughter of Mr. White, and Bond's love interest who assisted him in his mission in the film *Spectre*. Fukunaga underscored Madeleine's importance to the film, as her presence allowed him to explore Bond's unresolved trauma stemming from the death of Vesper Lynd in *Casino Royale*.[11] After seeing the film, Seydoux said: \"There's a lot of emotion in this *Bond*. It's very moving. I bet you're going to cry. When I watched it, I cried, which is weird because I am in it.\"[12]\n* Rami Malek as Lyutsifer Safin:[13]  \nA facially disfigured terrorist and scientist on a revenge mission against Spectre who later becomes Bond's adversary.[14][15] Producer Barbara Broccoli described the character as \"the one that really gets under Bond's skin. He's a nasty piece of work.\"[14] Malek described the character as someone who considers \"himself as a hero almost in the same way that Bond is a hero\".[16][17] Fukunaga described Safin as \"more dangerous than anyone [Bond has] ever encountered\" and a \"hyper-intelligent and worthy adversary\".[18][19]\n* Lashana Lynch as Nomi:[20]  \nA new \"00\" agent who entered active service some time after Bond's retirement and was assigned the 007 number.[21][22] Lynch hoped that her character would bring a new layer of relatability to the world of espionage, saying \"When you're dealing with a franchise that has been slick for so many years, I wanted to throw a human spin on it—to deal with anxiety and be someone who's figuring it out, completely on her toes\".[23]\n* Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory / M:[10] Head of MI6 and Bond's superior officer.\n* Ben Whishaw as Q:[10]  \nMI6's Quartermaster who outfits \"00\" agents with equipment for use in the field. In the film, Q is revealed to be gay when Moneypenny and Bond interrupt him planning a dinner date with another man.[24][25][26][27] Whishaw considers his version of Q to have ended, saying: \"I think I'm done now. I've done the three that I was ... contracted to do. So I think that might be it for me.\"[28]\n* Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny:[10]  \nM's secretary and Bond's ally. Harris says since *Spectre*, \"Moneypenny has grown up somewhat. I think she still has her soft spot for Bond though, that's never going to go. But she's an independent woman with her own life\".[29]\n* Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter:[30]  \nBond's friend and a CIA field officer. Wright was asked what can be expected from Felix in the film, to which he replied, \"Well, I think it's known that Felix pulls James back into the game and away we go from there\".[31] While Wright was surprised he was not asked to return in *Skyfall* and *Spectre*, he felt Felix's return in *No Time to Die* \"gives more weight\" due to his prior absence. Wright said that the film establishes the brotherhood of Bond and Felix, which he described as the \"core\" of their relationship.[32]\n* Billy Magnussen as Logan Ash: A CIA agent assigned by Leiter to support Bond in finding Obruchev.[33] Ash is later revealed to be a double agent working for Safin.\n* Christoph Waltz as Ernst Stavro Blofeld:[22]  \nBond's arch-enemy and foster brother. He is the founder and head of the criminal syndicate Spectre and is now in MI6 custody. Fukunaga explained why Blofeld returns and teased the character's \"new role\" in the film by saying: \"Blofeld is an iconic character in all the *Bond* films. He's in prison, but he certainly can't be done yet, right? So what could he be doing from in there and what nefarious, sadistic things does he have planned for James Bond and the rest of the world?\"[34]\n* David Dencik as Dr. Valdo Obruchev: A rogue scientist who created Project Heracles.[35]\n* Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner: M's chief of staff.[36]\n* Ana de Armas as Paloma: A CIA agent assisting Bond.[22] De Armas described her character as \"irresponsible\" and \"bubbly\" and playing a key role in Bond's mission.[37]\n* Dali Benssalah as Primo: A mercenary and an adversary whom Bond first encounters in Matera.[38]\n* Lisa-Dorah Sonnet as Mathilde: The five-year-old daughter of James Bond and Madeleine Swann.[39]\n\n\nAdditionally, Hugh Dennis and Priyanga Burford portray scientists working at an MI6 laboratory.[40] Mathilde Bourbin and Coline Defaud appear as Madeleine Swann's mother and young Madeleine respectively in the film's opening sequence.[41][42] Brigitte Millar also reprises her role as Spectre chief Dr. Vogel from *Spectre*.[43]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph of director Cary Joji Fukunaga at the UK premiere of television miniseries Maniac](image)Cary Joji Fukunaga, director of *No Time to Die*\nDevelopment of *No Time to Die* began in early 2016.[44] In March 2017, screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade—who have worked on every *Bond* film since *The World Is Not Enough* (1999)—were approached to write the script by producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson.[45] Purvis and Wade mapped out the story for the film in 2017.[46] Sam Mendes stated that he would not return after directing *Skyfall* and *Spectre*.[47] Christopher Nolan ruled himself out to direct.[48] By July 2017, Yann Demange, David Mackenzie and Denis Villeneuve were courted to direct.[49] In December 2017, Villeneuve decided against the role due to his commitments to *Dune*.[50]\n\n\nIn February 2018, Danny Boyle was established as frontrunner for the directing position.[51] Boyle's original pitch to Broccoli and Wilson saw John Hodge writing a screenplay based on Boyle's idea with Purvis and Wade's version scrapped.[52] Hodge's draft was greenlit, and Boyle was confirmed to direct with a production start date of December 2018.[53] However, Boyle and Hodge left in August 2018 due to creative differences.[54] It was reported at the time that Boyle's exit was due to the casting of Tomasz Kot as the lead villain; however, Boyle later confirmed the dispute was over the script.[55][56] The release date became contingent on whether the studio could find a replacement for Boyle within sixty days.[57][58] Cary Joji Fukunaga was announced as the new director in September 2018.[59][60] Fukunaga became the first American to direct an Eon Productions *Bond* film and the first director to receive a writing credit for any version.[61][b] Fukunaga had been considered for *Spectre* before Mendes was hired, and afterwards had expressed an interest to Broccoli and Wilson about directing a future *Bond* film.[64] Linus Sandgren was hired as cinematographer in December 2018.[65]\n\n\nPurvis and Wade were brought back to start working on a new script with Fukunaga in September 2018.[64][66] *Casino Royale* and *Quantum of Solace* screenwriter Paul Haggis turned in an uncredited rewrite in November 2018,[67] with Scott Z. Burns doing the same in February 2019.[68] At Daniel Craig's request, Phoebe Waller-Bridge provided a script polish in April 2019.[69] Waller-Bridge is the second female screenwriter credited with writing a *Bond* film after Johanna Harwood co-wrote *Dr. No* and *From Russia with Love*.[70][c] Barbara Broccoli was questioned about the MeToo movement at the *Bond 25* launch event, where she stated that Bond's attitude towards women would move with the times and the films should reflect that.[70] In a separate interview, Waller-Bridge argued that Bond was still relevant and that \"he needs to be true to this character\", instead suggesting that it was the films which had to grow and evolve, emphasising \"the important thing is that the film treats the women properly\".[64][73]\n\n\nSome concepts changed during development with Fukunaga. An early unrealised idea he considered was to have seen the film take place \"inside Bond's head\", while being tortured by Blofeld in *Spectre*, up until the end of act two of a three-act structure.[74] Originally, Safin, the villain, and his henchman would wear masks based on Siberian bear-hunting armour. The henchman character was written out before filming, and Fukunaga requested changes to Safin's costume. A new mask based on Noh, a Japanese style of theatre, was introduced as Fukunaga felt that the original mask was dominating the costume.[75]\n\n\nPaloma's costume, a navy Michael Lo Sordo gown, was chosen by costume designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb to enable the character to fight alongside Bond while still being dressed elegantly and formally for the black tie event in the plot.[76]\n\n\nThe film entered production under the working title of *Bond 25*. The title *No Time to Die* was announced on 20 August 2019.[77][d] Broccoli said: \"We were struggling to find a title. We wanted a title that wouldn't give away anything but would be understandable, and after you see the movie, have a deeper resonance, because that's often what Fleming titles are all about.\"[83]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nWhen Boyle was hired, he pitched the film to take place in present-day Russia and explore Bond's origins; he left the production after Broccoli and Wilson \"lost confidence\" in the idea.[84] During Boyle's time, a leaked casting sheet described the male leading role as a \"cold and charismatic Russian\" and the female leading role as a \"witty and skillful survivor\". Production also sought male supporting roles of Māori descent with \"advanced combat skills\".[85] The idea of Bond having a child was introduced by Hodge and retained for the final script.[84]\n\n\nWaller-Bridge was hired to revise dialogue, work on character development and add humour to the script.[86] The character of Paloma was made more significant from originally being a simple contact; Purvis and Wade indicated this was probably written by Waller-Bridge at Fukunaga's request.[46]\n\n\n*No Time to Die* is the first Eon-produced film in which Bond actually dies. Craig first proposed killing Bond in 2006, after the premiere of *Casino Royale*; Broccoli agreed to the suggestion. Craig said, \"It's the only way I could see for myself to end it all and to make it like that was my tenure, someone else could come and take over ... When he [Craig's Bond] goes, he can't come back.\"[87] Wilson said it was \"the fitting way to deal with a situation where a person is risking their life all the time. Eventually, the odds catch up with you.\"[87] The production team considered several ways for Bond to die, including being shot by an anonymous shooter. However, Fukunaga said that a \"conventional weapons death\" felt inappropriate considering that Bond had been able to \"escape from everything else\". Craig said the team tried to create a sense of tragedy and weight by using Safin's bioweapon, which killed \"the only thing that Bond wants in life ... to be with the people he loves\".[87]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nAfter *Spectre*, there was speculation that it would be Craig's final *Bond* film. Immediately after the film's release, Craig had complained about the rigours of performing the part, saying he would rather \"slash [his] wrists\" than play Bond again.[88] In May 2016, it was reported that Craig had received a $100 million offer from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to do two more *Bond* films, but turned it down.[89] In October 2016, Craig denied having made a decision but praised his time in the role, describing it as \"the best job in the world doing Bond\". He further denied that $150 million was offered to him for the next two instalments.[90] Eventually, Craig was paid $25 million for his involvement.[91] In August 2017, on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*, Craig said that the next film would mark his final appearance as Bond.[5][92] His position was reaffirmed between November 2019 and March 2020.[93][94] Craig later acknowledged that the physicality of the part had deterred him from returning to the role, having sustained injuries shooting earlier *Bond* films.[95][96][97] Craig was also drawn by the similarities to *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*. Craig said of *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*,[98]\n\n\n\n\n> It's one of the best movies because it had a love story. And what is life without love? I kind of lifted from Fleming Bond's ambiguity, conflict and passions.You could take 1952 passions or you could just transpose them to modern passions. And that's what I did. He loves, he cares, he’s honourable, he’s incorruptible and I love that he's a complex character\n> \n> — Daniel Craig, *The Guardian*[98]\n> \n\n\nWith Craig's departure, Broccoli said that *No Time to Die* would \"tie up loose narrative threads\" from Craig's previous *Bond* films and \"come to an emotionally satisfying conclusion\".[64]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Fukunaga said that Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris and Ralph Fiennes would all be reprising their roles in the film.[10] Fukunaga also said that Léa Seydoux would be reprising her role as Madeleine Swann, making her the first female lead to appear in successive *Bond* films.[10] Rory Kinnear returns as Bill Tanner, as does Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter.[30] Wright makes his third appearance in the series after *Casino Royale* and *Quantum of Solace* and becomes the first actor to play Leiter three times.[99] Ana de Armas, Dali Benssalah, David Dencik, Lashana Lynch, Billy Magnussen and Rami Malek were announced as cast members in a live stream, at Ian Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. The event was on 25 April 2019 and marked the official start of production.[30][100] The film is the second to unite de Armas with Craig, after *Knives Out* (filmed in 2018).[101] Malek was further announced as playing Safin, the film's villain,[102] but the actor revealed in an interview that his character would not be connected to any religion or ideology.[103]\n\n\nAfter the release of *Spectre* it was reported that Christoph Waltz had signed on to return as Blofeld for further *Bond* films, on the condition that Craig returned as Bond.[104] Despite Craig's definite casting as Bond, Waltz announced in October 2017 that he would not return as Blofeld, but did not give a reason for his departure.[105] Waltz's casting as Blofeld in *No Time to Die* was not announced at the press launch but was revealed in the trailer in December 2019.[106][107]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nFilming began at Langvann Lake, Norway, the backdrop for Madeleine's childhood home[108]\n![Photograph of Ponte Viadotto-Acquedotto Madonna della Stella, Italy](image)\nPonte Viadotto-Acquedotto Madonna della Stella, Gravina di Puglia, used in the bridge stunt[109]\n![Photograph of a winding road on the disputed island of Kalsoy](image)\nKalsoy serves as the disputed island that is Safin's base; its sets were inspired by those of Ken Adam and the buildings of Tadao Ando[110][111]\n\nProduction was scheduled to begin on 3 December 2018 at Pinewood Studios,[112] but filming was delayed until April 2019 after Boyle's departure.[60][113] The film is the first in the series to have sequences shot with 65mm IMAX film cameras.[114] Fukunaga and Sandgren pushed for using film over digital to enhance the look of the film.[64] The budget was reported to be between $250 million and $301 million,[3][115][116] while B25 Limited, Eon's subsidiary company created for the film's production, reported a total production cost of £214 million.[117]\n\n\nFilming locations included Italy, Jamaica, Norway, the Faroe Islands and London, in addition to Pinewood Studios.[118][119] In March 2019, production started in Nittedal, Norway, with the second unit capturing scenes on a frozen lake.[120][121] On 28 April 2019, principal photography officially began in Jamaica, including Port Antonio.[122][119] In May 2019, Craig sustained an ankle injury while filming in Jamaica and subsequently underwent minor surgery.[123] In June 2019, production was further interrupted when a controlled explosion damaged the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios and left a crew member with minor injuries.[124] Also in June 2019, production went back to Norway to shoot a driving sequence along the Atlantic Ocean Road featuring an Aston Martin V8 Vantage.[125][126] Aston Martin also confirmed that the DB5, DBS Superleggera, and Valhalla models would feature in the film.[127]\n\n\nProduction then moved to the UK. Scenes featuring Craig, Fiennes, Harris and Kinnear were filmed around London, including Whitehall, Senate House and Hammersmith.[128][129][130] In July 2019, filming took place in the town of Aviemore and in the surrounding Cairngorms National Park area.[131][132][133] Some scenes were also shot at the Ardverikie House Estate and on the banks of Loch Laggan, just outside the park.[134] The forest scene was filmed in Buttersteep Forest in Windsor Great Park.[135] In late August 2019, the second unit moved to southern Italy where they began to shoot a chase sequence involving an Aston Martin DB5 through the streets of Matera, including a doughnut in Piazza San Giovanni Battista.[136] In early September 2019, the main production unit, Craig and Léa Seydoux arrived to film scenes inside several production-built sets, as well as further sequences in Maratea and Gravina in Puglia.[137][138] Scenes were shot in the town of Sapri in southern Italy throughout September. Locations included the town's \"midnight canal\" and railway station. The city is referred to as \"Civita Lucana\" in the film.[139] In late September 2019, scenes were filmed in the Faroe Islands.[140]\n\n\nThe Ministry of Defence confirmed that filming took place around the Royal Navy destroyer HMS *Dragon* and a Royal Air Force C-17 aircraft, at RAF Brize Norton.[141][142][e] No weapons were fired.[143] The British Army's Household Cavalry unit was also filmed.[144] Filming of an action sequence with a seaplane took place at CMA CGM’s Kingston Container Terminal in Jamaica.[145][146] Whishaw praised Fukunaga's directing work, saying \"It was great and you know what was amazing is that he treated it, or was able to approach it, it felt to me almost as if it were an independent film. You know? And it was quite improvisational... we didn't do many takes\". He added, \"It was very light. Sometimes quite chaotic, but I'm very excited to see how he's constructed the final film\".[147]\nPrincipal photography wrapped up on 25 October 2019 at Pinewood Studios with the filming of a chase sequence set in Havana, Cuba.[148] Production had intended to shoot the sequence earlier, but was forced to reschedule when Craig injured his ankle in Jamaica.[97] Further pick-up shots at Pinewood were confirmed by Fukunaga on 20 December 2019.[149][150]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nVisual effects for *No Time to Die* were created by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Framestore, DNEG, and Cinesite.[151] Charlie Noble was the visual effects supervisor.[152] Post-production concluded without further changes, as the film's release date was delayed.[153]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: No Time to Die (soundtrack)\n\n![Composer Hans Zimmer](image)\n![Singer Billie Eilish](image)\nHans Zimmer (left) composed the film's score and Billie Eilish (right) performed the theme song.\n\nIn July 2019, Dan Romer was announced as composer for the film's score, having previously worked with Fukunaga on *Beasts of No Nation* and *Maniac*.[154] Romer left the film due to creative differences in November 2019.[155] Hans Zimmer replaced Romer by January 2020.[156] It is the first time in the *Bond* series history that a composer has been replaced during post-production, and the second major personnel change for the film after Boyle's departure.[157] Steve Mazzaro produced the score, while Johnny Marr played guitar. The *No Time to Die* score album was set to be released through Decca Records in March 2020 but was delayed to 1 October 2021 to coincide with the release of the film.[158][159]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Billie Eilish was announced as the performer of the film's theme song, with her brother, Finneas O'Connell, serving as co-writer as well as the track's producer. The song, which has the same title, was released on 13 February 2020.[160] At the age of 18, Eilish is the youngest artist to record a Bond theme song.[161][162] The song's music video was subsequently released on 1 October 2020.[163] Despite the film's delay, the song was nominated for and won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, on 14 March 2021, six months before the film's release date, because the song itself was released during the 2019–20 eligibility period, in anticipation of the film's original April 2020 release date.[164]\n\n\nThe song \"Dans la ville endormie\" by French singer Dalida is heard briefly in the opening scene.[165][166] Louis Armstrong's version of \"We Have All the Time in the World\" is a recurring theme included three times within the score and originally appeared in *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*, recalling both love and loss experienced by Bond following a similar poignancy in this film.[167] The track is played in full during the closing credits.[168]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Distribution rights[edit]\n\n\nThe Sony Pictures contract to co-produce the *Bond* films with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Eon Productions expired with the release of *Spectre* in 2015.[169] In April 2017, Sony Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures, and Annapurna Pictures entered a bidding competition to win the distribution rights.[170] MGM secured the North American, digital, and worldwide television rights to the film through its distribution arm United Artists Releasing.[171][172] Universal became the international distributor and worldwide holder of the rights for physical home media (DVD and Blu-ray) through its subsidiary Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, prior to its joint venture agreement in January 2020 with Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.[171][173][f]\n\n\n\n### Theatrical release and postponements[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema\n\n*No Time to Die* had its world premiere at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 28 September 2021, and was released in cinemas on 30 September 2021 in the UK and on 8 October 2021 in the US in 2D, RealD 3D, 4DX, ScreenX, Dolby Cinema and IMAX.[175][176] The film also opened the same week in September in South Korea and the following week in October in Brazil, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Russia. China and Australia would see the release later in October and November 2021. The film had the highest box office opening weekend takings in the UK for any *Bond* feature.[177][178]\n\n\n*No Time to Die* was originally scheduled for release in November 2019, but was postponed to February 2020 and then to April 2020 after Boyle's departure.[53][60][g] The premiere in China and a countrywide publicity tour, planned for April 2020, were cancelled due to the early outbreak of COVID-19 in the country.[181] By March 2020, the global spread of the virus and the declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization prompted a joint open letter from two *Bond* fan sites addressed to the producers. The letter asked that the release be delayed to minimise the risk of spreading the disease and to ensure the film's commercial success.[182][183] On 4 March 2020, MGM and Eon Productions announced that after \"thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace\" they had postponed the release until 12 November 2020 in the UK and 25 November 2020 in the US.[184][185][h] *No Time to Die* was the first major film affected by the pandemic.[179] According to *Deadline Hollywood*, MGM and Universal needed to assure a strong performance across all international markets. It was hoped that the rescheduling to November would ensure all cinemas, particularly those in China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, and France that were closed due to the pandemic, would be open and operational.[179]\n\n\nIn the early stages of the pandemic, an estimated 70,000 cinemas in China closed, and countries including Australia and the UK closed cinemas to minimise the spread of the virus.[186][187][188] *Variety* said the studio had already spent $66 million on promoting the film, while *The Hollywood Reporter* wrote that the delay cost MGM $30–50 million in wasted marketing costs, estimating that the global box office losses could have exceeded $300 million had the film stayed in its April 2020 slot.[116][189] In October 2020, *No Time to Die* was delayed again to 2 April 2021.[190] The decision to delay the release was made when it became apparent that theatrical markets, especially in the US, would not see full demand. After the delay was announced, the British chain Cineworld, the world's second-largest cinema chain, closed its cinemas indefinitely.[191] Chief executive Mooky Greidinger said the delay of *No Time to Die* was the \"last straw\" for Cineworld following a string of other film delays and cancellations.[192]\n\n\nIn January 2021, the film was rescheduled to 8 October 2021.[193] In February 2021, an earlier release date of 30 September 2021 was announced for the UK.[194] In August 2021, it was announced that the release date in Australia was delayed from 30 September to 11 November 2021, in response to their national lockdowns.[195][196] It was also screened at the Zurich Film Festival on the same day as the world premiere and the first *Bond* film to be in the official selection at a festival.[197] The release in China was on 29 October 2021.[198]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment released *No Time to Die* on DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray in the UK on 20 December 2021 and in the US on 21 December 2021.[199][200] It was available from digital download services on 9 November 2021 in the US.[201] The 31-day theatrical release window of the film is considered a relatively quick turnaround for a film of this size. One factor has been that *Bond* films attract an older audience and that demographic has been hesitant to return to cinemas during the pandemic.[202][203]\n\n\n*No Time to Die* was the top-ranking film on Vudu and Google Play for two weeks and iTunes for five weeks.[204][205][206][207][208] In the UK, it was the highest-selling digital title of 2021, with more than 430,000 units sold.[209] Upon its release in disc format, *No Time to Die* debuted atop the \"NPD VideoScan First Alert\" chart for both the overall disc sales and Blu-ray sales in the US.[210] According to *The Numbers*, it sold a combined 380,902 Blu-ray and DVD units in the first week for a revenue of $9.7 million.[3] It was the top-selling-title on both charts for three weeks.[211] It also debuted at the first position on Redbox's disc rental charts and second on its digital charts.[212] According to the NPD Group, it sold the eighth-highest amount of DVDs and Blu-rays in 2021, and the second-highest in December 2021.[213]\n\n\nIn the UK, it ranked atop the Official Film Chart for three weeks. The film was the highest-selling title on disc in the country during 2021 with 1.15 million units being sold, including 717,500 DVD and Blu-ray units being sold within two weeks. It was also the highest-selling Blu-ray title of 2021 with 237,000 units sold, in addition to becoming the highest-selling title on 4K Blu-ray in the first week of release and selling the highest number of discs for any title in first week of release since 2017 with 621,000 Blu-ray and DVDs being sold. In addition, it sold a combined 780,000 units across digital platforms and retail in the final week of 2021.[214][215][209][216]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*No Time to Die* grossed $160.9 million in the United States and Canada and $613.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $774.2 million.[2][3] It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2021.[217] Because of the combined production and promotional costs of at least $350 million, it was estimated that the film would have needed to gross at least $800 million worldwide in order to break even.[218][219]\n\n\n*No Time to Die*'s opening weekend set a $119.1 million box office from 54 countries, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico and Spain, besting its $90 million projections. It was the first film since the COVID-19 pandemic that crossed $100 million in an overseas debut without the China market.[220][221] *The Hollywood Reporter* stated the premiere was the biggest in the United Kingdom since the pandemic began.[222] In the United States and Canada, *No Time to Die* was projected to gross $65–85 million in its opening weekend.[223] The film made $23.3 million on its first day, including $6.3 million from Thursday night previews (which included $1 million from Wednesday previews), the best total of the franchise. It went on to debut to $55.2 million,[224][225] topping the box office and marking the fourth-best opening weekend of the franchise.[218] *No Time to Die* earned an additional $6.9 million on Columbus Day, bringing its four-day total in the United States and Canada to $62.2 million.[226][227] *Deadline Hollywood* attributed the slight underperformance to the film's 163-minute runtime limiting the number of showtimes.[226] *TheWrap* said that the opening was good news for cinemas, even if the studio did not break even during the film's theatrical run, and that it was an encouraging sign for upcoming adult-oriented pictures.[219] The film fell 56% in its second weekend to $24.3 million, finishing second behind newcomer *Halloween Kills*.[228] *No Time to Die* was re-released in IMAX for the weekend ending on 23 January 2022 as part of the 60th anniversary of the *Bond* film series.[229]\n\n\n*No Time to Die* became the highest-grossing film of 2021 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, surpassing *F9* on 17 October.[230] In China, the film opened to a $28.2 million weekend, displacing *The Battle at Lake Changjin* from the top rank on the country's box office, despite 13% of cinemas being closed due to China's policies against local COVID-19 outbreaks.[231] It remained atop the box office charts during its second weekend despite a drop of 59%, earning $11.4 million for a cumulative total of $49.2 million according to Artisan Gateway.[232] It became the highest-grossing non-Chinese film of 2021 outside the United States and Canada on 14 November, earning an estimated $24 million for a cume of $558.2 million, which included $126 million in the United Kingdom, $70 million in Germany and $57.9 million in China. It also opened to an $8.2 million weekend in Australia, which was the biggest opening for any film since December 2019.[233]\n\n\nDuring the weekend of 19–21 November, *No Time to Die* overtook *F9* to become the highest-grossing non-Chinese film of 2021, reaching a global cume of around $734 million as it grossed an estimated $2.6 million in the United States and Canada, as well as $13.4 million from 72 countries outside the two territories.[234][235] It overtook *Spectre* the following weekend to become the third-highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom as well as the second-highest-grossing *Bond* film in the market with a gross of $129.9 million.[236]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*No Time to Die* has an approval rating of 83% based on 425 reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The critics consensus states: \"It isn't the sleekest or most daring 007 adventure, but *No Time to Die* concludes Daniel Craig's franchise tenure in satisfying style.\"[237] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 67 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[238] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an 83% positive score, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend it.[226]\n\n\n\n![Photograph of UN Global Advocate Daniel Craig beside UN Secretary-General António Guterres, UNMAS Director Agnès Marcaillou, cropped to show only Craig](image)Daniel Craig was praised for his final portrayal of James Bond[239]\nThe film received praise from many film critics.[240] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* called it \"an epic barnstormer\" delivered \"with terrific panache\" and with \"pathos, action, drama, camp comedy, heartbreak, macabre horror, and outrageously silly old-fashioned action\".[241] Robbie Collin of *The Daily Telegraph* described it as \"extravagantly satisfying\", \"often very funny\" with gadgets \"both improbable and outrageous\", and that it has been filmed with \"gorgeous\" cinematography, starting with \"a sensationally thrilling and sinister prologue\" and ending with a \"moving conclusion\".[242] Kevin Maher of *The Times* wrote: \"It's better than good. It's magnificent\";[243] he later named the film one of the best films of 2021.[244]\n\n\nBarry Hertz of *The Globe and Mail* wrote that the film \"makes sure that my eyes are following each and every oh-whoa stunt. As well as guaranteeing that I actually care about whether (or, really, how) Bond gets out of this one.\"[245] Mick LaSalle of the *San Francisco Chronicle* wrote that the film \"takes its place among the best of the entire series\", and concluded \"Craig leaves the series in a mammoth, 163-minute extravaganza that audiences will be enjoying for decades. It's a lovely thing to see.\"[246] K. Austin Collins of *Rolling Stone* described the film as being \"just fine: sometimes intriguing, sometimes not, sometimes boring, sometimes not\", adding: \"It's a bit more successful if we think of it instead as a tribute to the Craig era, and to the star himself.\"[247]\n\n\nMichael O'Sullivan of *The Washington Post* gave the film three out of four stars, writing that it was \"a bit too long and a bit too complicated\", but added that it was \"also a fittingly complicated and ultimately perversely satisfying send-off for the actor\".[248] Peter Rainer of *The Christian Science Monitor* gave the film three out of five stars, writing: \"It offers up the requisite thrills, stunts, and bad guys. Beautiful people abound, and 007 still knows how to fill out a tux.\" However, he questioned \"Has James Bond become irrelevant?\"[249]\n\n\nConversely, some critics found fault with the film. John Nugent of *Empire* criticised its length (2 hours and 43 minutes), asserting that the plotting and exposition in the middle third \"doesn't justify that heaving runtime\". Nevertheless, he thought the film \"a fitting end to the Craig era\".[250] Kyle Smith of *National Review* also criticised the film's length, and described it as \"the least fun and most somber excursion in the entire Bond series\".[251] Clarisse Loughrey of *The Independent* found it uneventful and disappointing: its core premise of a biological weapon of mass destruction was described as \"generic spy nonsense\", while she felt that Rami Malek \"gives almost nothing to the role beyond his accent and stereotyped disfigurement makeup\".[252]\n\n\nDavid Sexton of *New Statesman* wrote that the film \"shows signs of emerging from an over-deliberated, market-sensitised production process\", adding: \"It delivers the set-pieces without ever trying to connect them with any urgency, almost like an anthology or re-mix.\"[253] Brian Tallerico of *RogerEbert.com* gave the film a score of two out of four stars, writing: \"For something that once felt like it so deftly balanced the old of a timeless character with a new, richer style, perhaps the biggest knock against [the film] is that there's nothing here that hasn't been done better in one of the other Craig movies.\"[254]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by No Time to Die\n\nAt the 94th Academy Awards, *No Time to Die* received nominations for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects, and won Best Original Song,[255] becoming the third film to do so after *Skyfall* and *Spectre*.[256] The film's other nominations include five British Academy Film Awards (winning one),[257] two Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning one),[258] and a Golden Globe Award (which it won).[259]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of James Bond\n* Production of the James Bond films\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As depicted in *Spectre* (2015)\n2. **^** The American directors John Huston and Robert Parrish were two of five directors who worked on the 1967 adaptation of *Casino Royale*, and Irvin Kershner directed the 1983 film *Never Say Never Again*.

Directed by Sam Mendes and written by John Logan, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Jez Butterworth, it stars Daniel Craig as Bond, alongside Christoph Waltz, Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Dave Bautista, Monica Bellucci, and Ralph Fiennes. It was distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. In the film, Bond learns of Spectre, an international crime organisation led by Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Waltz).\n\n\nDespite initially stating he would not direct *Spectre,* Mendes confirmed his return in 2014 after Nicolas Winding Refn declined to direct; Mendes became the first to direct successive *James Bond* films since John Glen. The inclusion of Spectre and its associated characters marked the end of the *Thunderball* controversy, in which Kevin McClory and Fleming were embroiled in lengthy legal disputes over the film rights to the novel; *Spectre* is the first film to feature these elements since *Diamonds Are Forever* (1971). Following the Sony Pictures hack, it was revealed Sony and Eon clashed regarding finance, stunts, and filming locations; *Spectre* is estimated to have a final budget of $245–300 million, making it one of the most expensive films ever made. Principal photography began in December 2014 and lasted until July 2015, with filming locations including Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy, Morocco, and Mexico.\n\n\n*Spectre* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall on 26 October 2015 and was theatrically released in conventional and IMAX formats in the United Kingdom that day, and in the United States on 6 November. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the action sequences, cast performances (particularly Craig's and Bautista's), and the musical score, but criticised the pacing and formulaic narrative decisions. It grossed $880 million worldwide, making it the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the second-highest grossing *James Bond* film after *Skyfall,* unadjusted for inflation. The film's theme song, \"Writing's on the Wall\", won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Original Song. The next film in the series, *No Time to Die,* was released in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn Mexico City, MI6 agent James Bond foils a bombing attempt on a stadium during a Day of the Dead festival. Bond obtains a ring stylized with an octopus from the deceased[*failed verification*] attacker, Marco Sciarra, uncovering his connection to a secret organization.\n\n\nIn London, Gareth Mallory, the current M, suspends Bond for his unauthorized action. M is engaged in a power struggle with Max Denbigh (whom Bond dubs \"C\"), the Director-General of the new, privately backed Joint Intelligence Service formed by the merger of MI5 and MI6. C campaigns for Britain to join the global surveillance and intelligence initiative \"Nine Eyes\" and shut down the '00' section. Bond, who was operating on a mission posthumously assigned by the previous M to eliminate Sciarra and track down his employers, goes rogue from MI6, with Eve Moneypenny and Q agreeing to aid Bond covertly.\n\n\nFollowing the previous M's instructions, Bond attends Sciarra's funeral in Rome and rescues his widow Lucia from assassins. Lucia reveals Sciarra's association with a terrorist network run by figurehead Franz Oberhauser, who has been presumed dead for twenty years. Using Sciarra's ring, Bond infiltrates a meeting where Oberhauser targets the \"Pale King\" for assassination. Oberhauser recognizes Bond, who flees across the city in a modified Aston Martin DB10, pursued by the network's top assassin, Hinx. Moneypenny identifies the Pale King as Mr. White, a former member of the organization's subsidiary, Quantum.\n\n\nBond tracks White down to Altaussee, where he is dying of thallium poisoning. Bond offers to protect his daughter, psychiatrist Madeleine Swann, who possesses knowledge about \"L'Américain\". White commits suicide. Bond finds Swann, who is reluctant to trust him until Hinx and his forces abduct her. Bond rescues Swann, earning him her trust. Q reveals Le Chiffre, Dominic Greene and Raoul Silva as agents of Oberhauser's organization, which Swann reveals is named Spectre. Swann takes Bond to L'Américain, a hotel in Tangier, where a secret room directs them to Oberhauser's base in the Sahara. Hinx ambushes them en route to the base, but they fight him off and defeat him.\n\n\nArriving at the base, Bond and Swann confront Oberhauser, who reveals Spectre's involvement in the Joint Intelligence Service and the Nine Eyes programme. C, complicit in Spectre's scheme, plans to give Spectre unrestricted access to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes. After showing Swann a distressing recording of her father's suicide, Oberhauser subjects Bond to neurosurgical torture. He discusses his shared past with Bond to Swann, revealing that they became adoptive brothers after Bond's parents died. Falsely believing that his father loved Bond more than him, Oberhauser killed him and staged his death as well. Since then, he founded Spectre intending to target Bond and adopted the name Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Bond and Swann break free, stun Blofeld with an explosive wristwatch, and destroy the base before fleeing to London to prevent Nine Eyes from going online.\n\n\nIn London, Bond, Swann, M, Q, Bill Tanner and Moneypenny gather to arrest C. However, Swann and Bond are separately abducted by Spectre operatives while the others proceed with the plan. After Q stops Nine Eyes from going online, a fatal struggle between M and C results in C's death. Bond is taken to the ruins of the old MI6 building, scheduled for demolition after Silva's bombing,[N 2] where Swann is held captive. Blofeld, who survived the base's destruction with heavy scarring to his face, gives Bond a three-minute ultimatum to abandon Swann or attempt a rescue and risk death. Bond finds Swann and they escape as the building collapses. Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter, which crashes onto Westminster Bridge. Blofeld survives and is arrested by M.\n\n\nLater, Bond receives his restored Aston Martin DB5 from Q and drives off with Swann.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Daniel Craig as James Bond, agent 007. The director Sam Mendes has described Bond as being extremely focused in *Spectre*, likening his new-found dedication to hunting.[15]\n* Christoph Waltz as Ernst Stavro Blofeld (born Franz Oberhauser), Bond's nemesis and the mysterious mastermind behind Spectre, as well as the puppeteer responsible for a series of recent events in Bond's life, motivated by a longstanding grudge against him.\n* Léa Seydoux as Madeleine Swann, a psychiatrist working at a private medical clinic in the Austrian Alps,[16] and the daughter of Mr White.[17]\n* Ben Whishaw as Q, MI6 quartermaster who outfits Bond with equipment for use in the field.\n* Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny, a former agent who left the field to become M's assistant.\n* Dave Bautista as Mr. Hinx, Spectre's top assassin.[18]\n* Andrew Scott as Max Denbigh \"C\", head of the new joint intelligence service and an agent for Spectre, heavily involved with their plan to merge nine national intelligence agencies into the Nine Eyes Committee, allowing Spectre to have the power to take over the world.\n* Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner, M's chief of staff.[19]\n* Jesper Christensen as Mr. White, a fugitive from MI6 and a former senior figure in Spectre's Quantum subsidiary, as portrayed in *Casino Royale* and *Quantum of Solace*,[20][21] now dying from thallium poisoning after falling from Spectre's favour over his reservations relating to human trafficking.\n* Monica Bellucci as Lucia Sciarra, the Italian wife of assassin Marco Sciarra.[22]\n* Ralph Fiennes as M (Gareth Mallory), head of MI6.\n* Stephanie Sigman as Estrella, a Mexican agent who accompanies Bond on his mission to assassinate Marco Sciarra.\n* Alessandro Cremona as Marco Sciarra,[23] an Italian Spectre agent whom Bond kills in the pre-title sequence of the movie.\n* Judi Dench as Mallory's predecessor M, who posthumously gives Bond his mission. This film marks Dench's eighth and final appearance as M, 20 years after beginning with *GoldenEye*.[24]\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2013, Mendes said he would not return to direct the next film in the series, then known as *Bond 24*;[25][26] he later recanted and announced that he would return, as he found the script and the plans for the long-term future of the franchise appealing.[27] Nicolas Winding Refn would later reveal that he turned down an offer to direct the film.[28] In directing *Skyfall* and *Spectre*, Mendes became the first director to oversee two successive *Bond* films since John Glen directed five consecutive films, ending with *Licence to Kill* in 1989.[29] Dennis Gassner returned as the film's production designer,[30] while cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema took over from Roger Deakins.[30][31] In July 2015 Mendes noted that the combined crew of *Spectre* numbered over one thousand, making it a larger production than *Skyfall*.[32] Craig is listed as co-producer. He considered the credit a high point of his career, saying, \"I'm just so proud of the fact that my name comes up somewhere else on the titles.\"[33]\n\n\nThe film's usage of the Spectre organisation[N 3] and its characters marked the end of long-standing litigation between Eon Productions and producer Kevin McClory, who sued James Bond creator Ian Fleming in 1961 claiming ownership over elements of the novel *Thunderball*,[34] and in an out of court settlement two years later, was awarded the novel's film rights, including Spectre and its characters.[N 4] McClory died in 2006, and in November 2013 MGM and the McClory estate formally settled the issue with Danjaq, sister company of Eon Productions—with MGM acquiring the full copyright film rights to the concept of Spectre and all of the characters associated with it.[36] It has been suggested that with the acquisition of the film rights and the organisation's re-introduction to the series' continuity, the SPECTRE acronym was discarded and the organisation reimagined as \"Spectre\".[37][38][39]\n\n\nWhen Sony Pictures Entertainment renegotiated with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures the deal to co-finance the *Bond* franchise in 2011, they were tasked to provide 25% of the negative cost of both *Skyfall* and *Spectre*, in exchange for receiving 25% of the profits plus distribution fees for overseeing its worldwide rollout. When the film was announced in June 2013, the budget was not yet fixed, but was certain to be higher than the $210 million of *Skyfall* due to foreign locations and bigger payments for Mendes and Craig.[40] In November 2014, Sony was targeted by hackers who released details of confidential e-mails between Sony executives regarding several high-profile film projects. Included within these were several memos relating to the production of *Spectre*, claiming that the film was over budget, detailing early drafts of the script written by John Logan, and expressing Sony's frustration with the project.[41] Eon Productions later issued a statement confirming the leak of what they called \"an early version of the screenplay\".[42] Eon resisted Sony and MGM's arguments to cut down on stunts and location work to reduce the budget, but managed to secure tax incentives and rebates, such as $14 million from Mexico. *Spectre* has a final budget estimated between $250 million and $275 million.[40]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\n*Spectre* marked the return of many scriptwriters from the previous *Bond* films, such as *Skyfall* writer John Logan;[29] Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who had done work in five previous *Bond* films,[N 5] and British playwright Jez Butterworth, who had previously made uncredited contributions to *Skyfall*. Butterworth was brought in to polish the script, being helped by Mendes and Craig. Butterworth considered that his changes involved adding what he would like to see as a teenager, and limited the scenes with Bond talking to men, as \"Bond shoots other men—he doesn't sit around chatting to them. So you put a line through that.\"[44] With the acquisition of the rights to Spectre and its associated characters, Purvis and Wade revealed that the film would provide a minor retcon to the continuity of the previous films, with the Quantum organisation alluded to in *Casino Royale* and introduced in *Quantum of Solace* reimagined as a division within Spectre rather than an independent organisation which is implied to be no longer active by the film's events. The plot of *Spectre* also linked the events of *Skyfall* to Craig's first two *Bond* movies by revealing antagonist Raoul Silva to be associated with Spectre reverting *Skyfall*'s initial solo story status.[45] Various plot ideas were discussed and discarded during the writing process; Ralph Fiennes revealed in a 2021 podcast interview that at one stage Sam Mendes suggested a plot twist revealing M to be the villain, which Fiennes vetoed. Another draft by John Logan had MI6 chief of staff Bill Tanner uncovered as a Spectre mole.[46][47][48]\n\n\nDespite being an original story, *Spectre* draws on Ian Fleming's source material, most notably in the character of Franz Oberhauser, played by Christoph Waltz, and his father Hannes. Hannes Oberhauser is a background character in the short story \"Octopussy\" from the *Octopussy and The Living Daylights* collection, and is named in the film as having been a temporary legal guardian of a young Bond in 1983.[49] As Sam Mendes searched for events in young Bond's life to follow the childhood discussed in *Skyfall*, he came across Hannes Oberhauser, who becomes a father figure to Bond. From there, Mendes conceived the idea of \"a natural child who had been pushed out, cuckoo in the nest\" by Bond, which became Franz.[50] Similarly, Charmian Bond is shown to have been his full-time guardian, observing the back story established by Fleming.[49]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)At the age of 50, Monica Bellucci became the oldest actress to be cast as a Bond girl.\nThe main cast was revealed in December 2014 at the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios. Daniel Craig returned for his fourth appearance as James Bond, while Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw reprised their roles as M, Eve Moneypenny and Q respectively, having been established in *Skyfall*. Rory Kinnear also reprised his role as Bill Tanner in his third appearance in the series.[51]\n\n\nChristoph Waltz was cast in the role of Franz Oberhauser, though he refused to comment on the nature of the part.[52] It was later revealed with the film's release that he is Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Waltz got interested in the film for dealing with technology-assisted mass surveillance, \"speaking about relevant social issues in a way that few *Bonds* have done before\", and denied rumours that the role was written specially for him, but added that \"when I came on board, the role grew, evolved, and mutated.\"[53]\n\n\nDave Bautista was cast as Mr Hinx after producers sought an actor with a background in contact sports.[54] The character only has one line in the entire film, \"Shit\". Sam Mendes thought the silent nature would drive Bautista away, but the lifelong Bond fan expressed interest in reviving the quiet henchman archetype of characters such as Jaws. Bautista's performance was inspired mostly by Oddjob from *Goldfinger*,[55] and said not talking created an acting challenge, \"trying to find this way where I am actually going to have to speak without speaking.\"[56] After casting Bérénice Marlohe, a relative newcomer, as Sévérine in *Skyfall*, Mendes sought out a more experienced actor for the role of Madeleine Swann, ultimately casting Léa Seydoux in the role.[57] Monica Bellucci joined the cast as Lucia Sciarra, becoming, at the age of fifty, the oldest actress to be cast as a Bond girl. She had previously auditioned for the role of Paris Carver in *Tomorrow Never Dies*, but was passed over in favour of Teri Hatcher.[58] In a separate interview with Danish website Euroman, Jesper Christensen revealed he would be reprising his role as Mr White from *Casino Royale* and *Quantum of Solace*.[20][21] Christensen's character was reportedly killed off in a scene intended to be used as an epilogue to *Quantum of Solace*, before it was removed from the final cut of the film, enabling his return in *Spectre*.[59]\n\n\nIn addition to the principal cast, Alessandro Cremona was cast as Marco Sciarra, Stephanie Sigman was cast as Estrella, and Detlef Bothe was cast as a villain for scenes shot in Austria.[23][60][61] In February 2015 over 1,500 background artistes were hired for the pre-title sequence set in Mexico, though they were replicated in the film, giving the effect of around 10,000 extras.[62][63][16][64]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nMendes revealed that production would begin on 8 December 2014 at Pinewood Studios, with filming taking seven months.[65] Mendes also confirmed several filming locations, including London, Mexico City and Rome. Van Hoytema shot the film mostly on Kodak 35mm film stock (in addition to digital cameras such as the 6K Arri Alexa 65mm[66]), in contrast to *Skyfall* being filmed solely on digital cameras.[67] Early filming took place at Pinewood Studios, and around London, with scenes variously featuring Craig and Harris at Bond's flat, and Craig and Kinnear travelling down the River Thames.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAfter being cancelled in 2012, the Jaguar C-X75 was recommissioned to appear in *Spectre*.\n![](image)\nThe Aston Martin DB10 is driven by Bond in the film.\n![](image)\nThe Aston Martin DB5 reappears after reconstruction in Q's workshop at the film's ending, with Bond driving away with it.\n\nFilming was carried out in Austria between December 2014 and February 2015, with production taking place in the area around Sölden—including the Ötztal Glacier Road, Rettenbach glacier and the adjacent ski resort plus cable car station—Obertilliach and Lake Altaussee.[69][70][71] Scenes filmed in Austria centred on the Ice Q Restaurant, standing in for the fictional Hoffler Klinik, a private medical clinic in the Austrian Alps. Filming included an action scene featuring a Land Rover Defender Bigfoot and a Range Rover Sport.[72] Various airplane models were used in filming, from a life-sized plane with detachable wings to film the crash in the woods, to plane fuselages either built atop snowmobiles or shot from nitrogen cannons.[73] Production was temporarily halted first by an injury to Craig, who suffered a meniscus tear whilst shooting a fight scene with Bautista,[74][75] and later by an accident involving a filming vehicle that saw three crew members injured, at least one of them seriously.[76][77]\n\n\nFilming temporarily returned to England to shoot scenes at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, which stood in for a location in Rome, before moving on to the city itself for a five-week shoot across the city, with locations including the Ponte Sisto bridge and the Roman Forum.[78] The production faced opposition from a variety of special interest groups and city authorities, who were concerned about the potential for damage to historical sites around the city, and problems with graffiti and rubbish appearing in the film.[79][80] Special effects supervisor Chris Corbould stated the scenes had to be extensively planned prior to filming specially to avoid any mishaps, going to the point of building protection above steps where cars would drive.[73] A car chase scene set along the banks of the Tiber River and through the streets of Rome[81] featured an Aston Martin DB10 (a model developed especially for the film, with only 10 examples produced[82]) and a Jaguar C-X75.[72] The C-X75 was originally developed as a hybrid electric vehicle with four independent electric engines powered by two jet turbines, before the project was cancelled.[83] The version used for filming was converted to use a conventional internal combustion engine, to minimise the potential for disruption from mechanical problems with the complex hybrid system. The C-X75s used for filming were developed by the engineering division of Formula One racing team Williams, who built the original C-X75 prototype for Jaguar.[84] Remote driving pods were built above the cars so the vehicles could be driven while the cameras focused on Craig and Bautista at the steering wheel.[73] According to chief stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell, filming the chase had the \"risk of skidding into the Vatican\", and led to \"a record for smashing up cars in *Spectre*—seven Aston Martins in all,\" with the film's car expenses estimated at £24 million ($48 million).[85]\n\n\nWith filming completed in Rome, production moved to Mexico City in late March to shoot the film's opening sequence, with scenes to include the Day of the Dead festival filmed in and around the Zócalo and the Centro Histórico district.[86] At the time, no such Day of the Dead parade like the one from the film took place in Mexico City; in 2016, due to the interest raised by *Spectre* and the government's desire to promote the pre-Hispanic Mexican culture, the federal and local authorities decided to organise an actual \"Día de Muertos\" parade through Paseo de la Reforma and Centro Histórico on 29 October 2016, which was attended by 250,000 people.[87][88] The film opens with a long take that joins six shots seamlessly, and was one of the few scenes that required previsualisation. Through extensive planning, filming did not require motion control cameras. The scene joints were done in post-production through re-timing and re-projections, which even matched Mexico locations with interiors filmed at Pinewood.[73]\n\n\n\n![](image)Filming of the Mexico City scenes, revolving around a Day of the Dead parade\nThe planned scenes required the city square to be closed for filming a sequence involving a fight aboard a Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm Bo 105CBS helicopter flown by stunt pilot Chuck Aaron,[89] which called for modifications to be made to several buildings to prevent damage.[90] This particular scene in Mexico required 1,500 extras, 10 giant skeletons and 250,000 paper flowers.[91] Reports in the Mexican media added that the film's second unit would move to Palenque in the state of Chiapas, to film aerial manoeuvres considered too dangerous to shoot in an urban area.[92] These were pasted over a computer-generated square and crowd below the helicopter, with motion capture doubles fighting inside. Mendes and the effects team felt that this approach \"would get believable composition and movement\" compared to adding a digital helicopter above the Mexico City location.[93] Following filming in Mexico, and during a scheduled break, Craig was flown to New York to undergo minor surgery to fix his knee injury. It was reported that filming was not affected and he had returned to filming at Pinewood Studios as planned on 22 April.[94] Nonetheless, some parts of the Mexico scene were done with stunt doubles, whose faces were digitally replaced with Craig's.[73]\n\n\nOn 17 May 2015 filming took place on the Thames in London. Stunt scenes involving Craig and Seydoux on a speedboat as well as a low flying helicopter near Westminster Bridge were shot at night, with filming temporarily closing both Westminster and Lambeth Bridges. Scenes were also shot on the river near MI6's headquarters at Vauxhall Cross.[95] The crew returned to the river less than a week later to film scenes solely set on Westminster Bridge. The London Fire Brigade was on set to simulate rain as well as monitor smoke used for filming. Craig, Seydoux, and Waltz, as well as Harris and Fiennes, were seen being filmed.[96] Prior to this, scenes involving Fiennes were shot at a restaurant in Covent Garden.[97] Blofeld's helicopter crash was done with two full sized helicopter shells, which were rigged with steelwork and an overhead track. Computer-generated rotor blades and scenery damage were added in post-production. The MI6 building, which in the film is vacated and scheduled for demolition following the terrorist attack from *Skyfall*, was replaced in the production plates for a digital reconstruction. When the building is detonated, it is a combination of both a miniature and a breakaway version of the digital building.[73]\n\n\nAfter wrapping up in England, production travelled to Morocco in June, with filming taking place in Oujda, Tangier and Erfoud, after preliminary work was completed by the production's second unit.[98] The headquarters of Spectre in Morocco was located in Gara Medouar which is a 'crater' caused by erosion and of neither volcanic nor impact origin.[99] An explosion filmed in Morocco holds a Guinness World Record for the largest film stunt explosion in cinematic history, involving 8,140 litres of kerosene and 24 charges each with a kilogramme of high explosives.[100] The outside shots of a train in a desert featured the Oriental Desert Express.[101] Principal photography concluded on 5 July 2015. A wrap-up party for *Spectre* was held in commemoration before entering post-production.[102] Filming took 128 days.[103]\n\n\nWhilst filming in Mexico City, speculation in the media claimed that the script had been altered to accommodate the demands of Mexican authorities—reportedly influencing details of the scene and characters, casting choices, and modifying the script to portray the country in a \"positive light\"—to secure tax concessions and financial support worth up to $20 million for the film.[104] This was denied by producer Michael G. Wilson,[104] who stated that the scene had always been intended to be shot in Mexico as production had been attracted to the imagery of the Day of the Dead, and that the script had been developed from there.[105] Production of *Skyfall* had previously faced similar problems while attempting to secure permits to shoot the film's pre-title sequence in India before moving to Istanbul.[106][107]\n\n\nFive companies did the visual effects—Industrial Light & Magic, Double Negative, Moving Picture Company, Cinesite and Peerless—under the supervision of Steve Begg. The computer-generated effects included set extensions, digital touches on the vehicles, and crumbling buildings.[73][93] A sixth one, Framestore, handled the title sequence, the seventh in the series designed by Daniel Kleinman. It took four months to complete, and centred on an octopus motif reminiscent of the Spectre logo, along with images of love and relationships.[108]\n\n\n\n### Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spectre (soundtrack)\n\nThomas Newman returned as *Spectre*'s composer.[30] Rather than composing the score once the film had moved into post-production, Newman worked during filming.[64] The theatrical trailer released in July 2015 contained a rendition of John Barry's *On Her Majesty's Secret Service* theme.[109][110] Mendes stated that the final film would have more than 100 minutes of music.[32] The soundtrack album was released on 23 October 2015 in the UK and 6 November 2015 in the US on Decca Records.[111][112]\n\n\nThe English band Radiohead were commissioned to write the title song, and submitted \"Man of War\", an unreleased song written in the 1990s.[113] It was rejected as it had not been written for the film and so was ineligible for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.[114] Radiohead recorded another song for the film, \"Spectre\", but this was also rejected as too melancholy.[115][114]\n\n\nIn September 2015, Eon announced that Sam Smith had recorded the title theme, \"Writing's on the Wall\".[116] Smith reported writing the song in a single session with regular collaborator Jimmy Napes in under half an hour before recording a demo. Satisfied with the quality, the filmmakers used the demo in the final release.[117] \"Writing's on the Wall\" was released as a download on 25 September 2015.[118] It received mixed reviews from critics and fans, particularly in comparison to Adele's \"Skyfall\",[119][120][121][122] leading to Shirley Bassey trending on Twitter on the day it was released.[106][123] Despite the mixed reception, it became the first Bond theme to reach number one in the UK Singles Chart,[124] the second to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song,[125] and the fifth to be nominated.[126][127][N 6] It also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards.[128]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Williams FW37 of Felipe Massa (front) carrying the 007 logo on its wing mirrors at the 2015 Mexican Grand Prix\nDuring the December 2014 press conference announcing the start of filming, Aston Martin and Eon unveiled the new DB10 as the official car for the film. The DB10 was designed in collaboration between Aston Martin and the filmmakers, with only 10 being produced especially for *Spectre* as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the company's association with the franchise.[129] Only eight of those 10 were used for the film, however; the remaining two were used for promotional work.[130] After modifying the Jaguar C-X75 for the film, Williams F1 carried the 007 logo on their cars at the 2015 Mexican Grand Prix, with the team playing host to the cast and crew ahead of the Mexican premiere of the film.[131][132]\n\n\nTo promote the film, the film's marketers continued the trend established during *Skyfall*'s production of releasing still images of clapperboards and video blogs on Eon's official social media accounts.[133][134]\n\n\nOn 13 March 2015, several members of the cast and crew, including Craig, Whishaw, Wilson and Mendes, as well as previous James Bond actor, Sir Roger Moore, appeared in a sketch written by David Walliams and the Dawson Brothers for Comic Relief's Red Nose Day on BBC One. In the sketch, they film a behind-the-scenes documentary on the filming of *Spectre*.[135][136] The first teaser trailer for *Spectre* was released worldwide in March 2015,[137] followed by the theatrical trailer in July[138] and the final trailer in October.[139]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daniel Craig, producer Barbara Broccoli, Naomie Harris and Christoph Waltz in a premiere for *Spectre* in Berlin\n*Spectre* had its world premiere at the Royal Film Performance, an event in aid of the Film & TV Charity, in London on 26 October 2015 at the Royal Albert Hall, the same day as its general release in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.[140][141] It was released in the United States on 6 November.[*citation needed*] Following the announcement of the start of filming, Paramount Pictures brought forward the release of *Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation* to avoid competing with *Spectre*.[142] In March 2015 IMAX corporation announced that *Spectre* would be screened in its cinemas, following *Skyfall*'s success with the company.[143] In the UK it received a wider release than *Skyfall*, with a minimum of 647 cinemas including 40 IMAX screens, compared to *Skyfall*'s 587 locations and 21 IMAX screens.[144]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Spectre* was released for Digital HD on 22 January 2016 and on DVD and Blu-ray on 9 and 22 February 2016 in the US and UK respectively.[145] It debuted atop the home video charts in both countries,[146][147] and finished 2016 with 1.5 million units in the UK, the second best-selling title of the year, behind only *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*,[148] and 2 million copies in the US, 12th in the year-end charts.[149]\n\n\nThe film was later released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on 22 October 2019 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment along with the previous three films, and standalone on 25 February 2020 in the US and 23 March 2020 in the UK.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Spectre* grossed $880.7 million worldwide; $135.5 million of the takings were generated from the UK market and $200.1 million from North America.[14] Worldwide, this made it the second-highest-grossing *James Bond* film after *Skyfall*,[150] and the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2015.[151] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $98.4 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it sixteenth on their list of 2015's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[152] Sony had expected the net profit of the film to be around $38 million had it performed to the same level of its predecessor, but it earned 20% less than *Skyfall*.[153] Sony paid 50% of the production costs for the film—which totalled some $250 million after accounting for government incentives—but received only 25% of certain profits, once costs were recouped. The studio also spent tens of millions of dollars in marketing and had to give MGM some of the profit from the studio's non-Bond films, including *22 Jump Street*.[153]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film grossed £4.1 million ($6.4 million) from its Monday preview screenings.[154] It grossed £6.3 million ($9.2 million) on its opening day[155] and then £5.7 million ($8.8 million) on Wednesday, setting UK records for both days.[156] In the film's first seven days it grossed £41.7 million ($63.8 million), breaking the UK record for highest first-week opening, set by *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*'s £23.9 million ($36.9 million) in 2004.[157] Its Friday–Saturday gross was £20.4 million ($31.2 million) compared to *Skyfall*'s £20.1 million ($31 million). The film also broke the record for the best per-screen opening average with $110,000, a record previously held by *The Dark Knight* with $100,200.[158] It has grossed a total of $136.3 million there.[159] In the UK, it surpassed *Avatar* to become the country's highest-grossing IMAX release ever with $10.09 million.[160]\n\n\n*Spectre* opened in Germany with $22.5 million (including previews), which included a new record for the biggest Saturday of all time,[161] Australia with $8.7 million (including previews) and South Korea opened to $8.2 million (including previews).[162] Despite the 13 November Paris attacks, which led to numerous theatres being closed down, the film opened with $14.6 million (including $2 million in previews) in France.[163] In Mexico, where part of the film was shot, it debuted with more than double that of *Skyfall* with $4.5 million.[161] It also bested its predecessor's opening in various Nordic regions where MGM is distributing, such as in Finland ($2.7 million) and Norway ($2.9 million),[164] and in other markets like Denmark ($4.2 million), the Netherlands ($3.4 million), and Sweden ($3.1 million).[164] In India, it opened at No. 1 with $4.8 million which is 4% above the opening of *Skyfall*.[165] It topped the German-speaking Switzerland box office for four weeks and in the Netherlands, it held the No. 1 spot for seven weeks straight where it topped *Minions* to become the top movie of the year.[159][166] The top earning markets are Germany ($70.3 million) and France ($38.8 million).[167] In Paris, it has the second-highest ticket sales of all time with 4.1 million tickets sold only behind *Spider-Man 3* which sold over 6.3 million tickets in 2007.[168]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada the film opened on 6 November 2015, and in its opening weekend, was originally projected to gross $70–75 million from 3,927 screens, the widest release for a Bond film.[169] However, after it grossed $5.3 million from its early Thursday night showings and $28 million on its opening day, weekend projections were increased to $75–80 million. The film ended up grossing $70.4 million in its opening weekend (about $20 million less than *Skyfall'*s $90.6 million debut, including IMAX previews), but nevertheless finished first at the box office.[170] IMAX generated $9.1 million for *Spectre* at 374 screens, premium large format made $8 million from 429 cinemas, reaping 11% of the film's opening, which means that *Spectre* earned $17.1 million (23%) of its opening weekend total in large-format venues. Cinemark XD generated $1.9 million in 112 XD locations.[170][171]\n\n\nIn China, it opened on 12 November and earned $15 million on its opening day, which is the second biggest 2D single day gross for a Hollywood film behind the $18.5 million opening day of *Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation* and occupying 43% of all available screens which included $790,000 in advance night screenings.[172] Through its opening weekend, it earned $48.1 million from 14,700 screens which is 198% ahead of *Skyfall*,[162] a new record for a Hollywood 2D opening.[173] IMAX contributed $4.6 million on 246 screens, also a new record for a three-day opening for a November release (breaking *Interstellar*'s record).[162] In its second weekend, it added $12.1 million falling precipitously by 75% which is the second worst second weekend drop for any major Hollywood release in China of 2015.[174] It grossed a total of $84.7 million there after four weekends (foreign films in the Middle Kingdom play for 30 days only, unless granted special extensions).[175] Despite a strong opening, it failed to attain the $100 million mark there as projected due to mixed response from critics and audiences as well as facing competition from local films.[159][176][177]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Spectre* has an approval rating of 63% based on 371 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.4/10. Its critical consensus reads, \"*Spectre* nudges Daniel Craig's rebooted Bond closer to the glorious, action-driven spectacle of earlier entries, although it's admittedly reliant on established 007 formula.\"[178] Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned *Spectre* a score of 60 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[179] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[170]\n\n\n\n![](image)Dave Bautista was praised for his performance as Hinx.\nPrior to its UK release, *Spectre* mostly received positive reviews.[180] Mark Kermode, film critic for *The Observer*, gave the film four out of five stars, observing that the film did not live up to the standard set by *Skyfall*, but was able to tap into audience expectations.[181] Writing in *The Guardian*, Peter Bradshaw gave the film a full five stars, calling it \"inventive, intelligent and complex\", and singling out Craig's performance as the film's highlight.[182] In another five star review, *The Daily Telegraph*'s Robbie Collin described *Spectre* as \"a swaggering show of confidence'\", lauding it as \"a feat of pure cinematic necromancy\".[183] Positive yet critical assessments included Kim Newman of *Sight and Sound*, who wrote that \"for all its wayward plotting (including an unhelpful tie-in with Bond's childhood that makes very little sense) and off-the-peg elements, *Spectre* works\" as he felt \"the audience's patience gets tested by two and a half hours of set-pieces strung on one of the series' thinner plots\";[184] and IGN's Chris Tilly, who rated the film 7.2 out of 10, considering *Spectre* \"solid if unspectacular\", and concluding that \"the film falls frustratingly short of greatness.\"[185]\n\n\nCritical appraisal was mixed in the United States. In a review for RogerEbert.com, Matt Zoller Seitz gave *Spectre* 2.5 out of 4, describing it as inconsistent and unable to capitalise on its potential.[186] Kenneth Turan, reviewing the film for *Los Angeles Times*, concluded that *Spectre* \"comes off as exhausted and uninspired\".[187] Manohla Dargis of *The New York Times* criticised the film as having \"nothing surprising\" and sacrificing its originality for the sake of box office returns.[188] *Forbes'* Scott Mendelson also heavily criticised the film, denouncing *Spectre* as \"the worst 007 movie in 30 years\".[189] Darren Franich of *Entertainment Weekly* viewed *Spectre* as \"an overreaction to our current blockbuster moment\", aspiring \"to be a serialized sequel\" and proving \"itself as a Saga\". While noting that \"[n]othing that happens in *Spectre* holds up to even minor logical scrutiny\", he had \"come not to bury *Spectre*, but to weirdly praise it. Because the final act of the movie is so strange, so willfully obtuse, that it deserves extra attention.\"[190] Christopher Orr, writing in *The Atlantic*, also criticised the film, saying that *Spectre* \"backslides on virtually every [aspect]\".[191] Lawrence Toppman of *The Charlotte Observer* called Craig's performance \"Bored, James Bored.\"[192] Alyssa Rosenberg, writing for *The Washington Post*, stated that the film turned into \"a disappointingly conventional *Bond* film.\"[193]\n\n\nIn a positive review published in *Rolling Stone*, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, describing *Spectre* as \"party time for Bond fans, a fierce, funny, gorgeously produced valentine to the longest-running franchise in movies\".[194] Mick LaSalle from the *San Francisco Chronicle*, raved that \"One of the great satisfactions of *Spectre* is that, in addition to all the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organisation out to steal everyone's personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person.\"[195] Stephen Whitty from *The New York Daily News*, who awarded the film four of five stars, stated that \"Craig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin. And while Lea Seydoux doesn't leave a huge impression as this film's 'Bond girl', perhaps it's because we've already met—far too briefly—the hypnotic Monica Bellucci, as the first real 'Bond woman' since Diana Rigg.\"[196] *Chicago Sun-Times* film reviewer Richard Roeper, who gave the film three stars out of four, considered the film \"solidly in the middle of the all-time rankings, which means it's still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to like it that way.\"[197] Michael Phillips, reviewing for the *Chicago Tribune*, stated, \"For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, *Spectre* works best when everyone's on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes.\"[198] *Variety* film critic Guy Lodge complained in his review that \"What's missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of *Skyfall,* as the film sustains its predecessor's nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent.\"[199]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAccolades received by *Spectre* (2015 film)\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | 28 February 2016 | Best Original Song | Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for \"Writing's on the Wall\"\n | Won\n | [200] |\n| Alliance of Women Film Journalists Awards | 12 January 2016 | Most Egregious Age Difference Between Leading Man and Love Interest\n | Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux | Nominated\n | [201][202] |\n| Art Directors Guild Awards | 31 January 2016 | Excellence in Production Design for a Contemporary Film | Dennis Gassner | Nominated\n | [203] |\n| Critics' Choice Movie Awards | 17 January 2016 | Best Song | \"Writing's on the Wall\"\n | Nominated\n | [204] |\n| Best Actor in an Action Movie | Daniel Craig | Nominated\n |\n| Empire Awards | 20 March 2016 | Best British Film | *Spectre* | Won\n | [205] |\n| Best Thriller | *Spectre* | Won\n |\n| Golden Globe Awards | 10 January 2016 | Best Original Song | Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for \"Writing's on the Wall\"\n | Won\n | [206] |\n| Hollywood Music in Media Awards | 11 November 2015 | Best Original Song in a Feature Film | Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for \"Writing's on the Wall\"\n | Nominated\n | [207][208] |\n| Houston Film Critics Society Awards | 9 January 2016 | Best Original Song\n | \"Writing's on the Wall\"\n | Nominated\n | [209][210] |\n| Japan Academy Film Prize | 4 March 2016 | Outstanding Foreign Language Film | *Spectre* | Nominated\n | [211] |\n| Make-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild Awards | 20 February 2016 | Best Contemporary Hair Styling in a Feature-Length Motion Picture | Zoe Tahir\n | Nominated\n | [212] |\n| Satellite Awards | 21 February 2016 | Best Cinematography | Hoyte van Hoytema | Nominated\n | [213][214] |\n| Best Original Score | Thomas Newman | Nominated\n |\n| Best Original Song | Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for \"Writing's on the Wall\"\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Visual Effects | Steve Begg and Chris Corbould | Nominated\n |\n| Best Art Direction and Production Design | Dennis Gassner | Nominated\n |\n| Best Film Editing | Lee Smith | Nominated\n |\n| Best Sound (Editing and Mixing) | Per Hallberg, Karen Baker Landers, Scott Millan, Gregg Rudloff, and Stuart Wilson | Nominated\n |\n| Saturn Awards | 22 June 2016 | Best Action or Adventure Film | *Spectre* | Nominated\n | [215][216] |\n| St. Louis Film Critics Association Awards | 20 December 2015 | Best Song\n | \"Writing's on the Wall\"\n | Won\n | [217][218] |\n| Teen Choice Awards | 31 July 2016 | Choice Movie: Action | *Spectre* | Nominated\n | [219] |\n| Choice Movie Actress: Action\n | Léa Seydoux | Nominated\n |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The production budget for *Spectre* has been debated. Estimates range from $245–250[6][7][8][9][10] to as high as $300–350 million.[11][12][13] The $350 million figure also incorporates the $100 million marketing budget.[13] $21.5 million was spent on television advertisements and a further $100 million was spent on promotion and advertising.[8]\n2. **^** As depicted in *Skyfall* (2012)\n3. **^** Originally stylised \"SPECTRE\" as an acronym of **SP**ecial **E**xecutive for **C**ounter-intelligence, **T**errorism, **R**evenge and **E**xtortion\n4. **^** Following the settlement, McClory collaborated with Eon to produce the adaptation *Thunderball* (1965), and licensed Spectre and its characters to Eon for ten years,[35] allowing their subsequent appearances in *You Only Live Twice*, *On Her Majesty's Secret Service* and *Diamonds Are Forever*\n5. **^**  Purvis and Wade were credited for the screenplay of *Quantum of Solace*, as they wrote the original draft of the film. However, the final script was written by Paul Haggis, with several uncredited co-writers.[43]\n6. **^** The other four were \"Skyfall\" (2012), \"For Your Eyes Only\" (1981), \"Nobody Does It Better\" (1977), and \"Live and Let Die\" (1973).[126][125]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Dalton, Stephen (21 October 2015). \"'Spectre': Film Review\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

Directed by Sam Mendes and written by John Logan, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Jez Butterworth, it stars Daniel Craig as Bond, alongside Christoph Waltz, Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Dave Bautista, Monica Bellucci, and Ralph Fiennes. It was distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. In the film, Bond learns of Spectre, an international crime organisation led by Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Waltz).\n\n\nDespite initially stating he would not direct *Spectre,* Mendes confirmed his return in 2014 after Nicolas Winding Refn declined to direct; Mendes became the first to direct successive *James Bond* films since John Glen. The inclusion of Spectre and its associated characters marked the end of the *Thunderball* controversy, in which Kevin McClory and Fleming were embroiled in lengthy legal disputes over the film rights to the novel; *Spectre* is the first film to feature these elements since *Diamonds Are Forever* (1971). Following the Sony Pictures hack, it was revealed Sony and Eon clashed regarding finance, stunts, and filming locations; *Spectre* is estimated to have a final budget of $245–300 million, making it one of the most expensive films ever made. Principal photography began in December 2014 and lasted until July 2015, with filming locations including Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy, Morocco, and Mexico.\n\n\n*Spectre* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall on 26 October 2015 and was theatrically released in conventional and IMAX formats in the United Kingdom that day, and in the United States on 6 November. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the action sequences, cast performances (particularly Craig's and Bautista's), and the musical score, but criticised the pacing and formulaic narrative decisions. It grossed $880 million worldwide, making it the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the second-highest grossing *James Bond* film after *Skyfall,* unadjusted for inflation. The film's theme song, \"Writing's on the Wall\", won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Original Song. The next film in the series, *No Time to Die,* was released in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn Mexico City, MI6 agent James Bond foils a bombing attempt on a stadium during a Day of the Dead festival. Bond obtains a ring stylized with an octopus from the deceased[*failed verification*] attacker, Marco Sciarra, uncovering his connection to a secret organization.\n\n\nIn London, Gareth Mallory, the current M, suspends Bond for his unauthorized action. M is engaged in a power struggle with Max Denbigh (whom Bond dubs \"C\"), the Director-General of the new, privately backed Joint Intelligence Service formed by the merger of MI5 and MI6. C campaigns for Britain to join the global surveillance and intelligence initiative \"Nine Eyes\" and shut down the '00' section. Bond, who was operating on a mission posthumously assigned by the previous M to eliminate Sciarra and track down his employers, goes rogue from MI6, with Eve Moneypenny and Q agreeing to aid Bond covertly.\n\n\nFollowing the previous M's instructions, Bond attends Sciarra's funeral in Rome and rescues his widow Lucia from assassins. Lucia reveals Sciarra's association with a terrorist network run by figurehead Franz Oberhauser, who has been presumed dead for twenty years. Using Sciarra's ring, Bond infiltrates a meeting where Oberhauser targets the \"Pale King\" for assassination. Oberhauser recognizes Bond, who flees across the city in a modified Aston Martin DB10, pursued by the network's top assassin, Hinx. Moneypenny identifies the Pale King as Mr. White, a former member of the organization's subsidiary, Quantum.\n\n\nBond tracks White down to Altaussee, where he is dying of thallium poisoning. Bond offers to protect his daughter, psychiatrist Madeleine Swann, who possesses knowledge about \"L'Américain\". White commits suicide. Bond finds Swann, who is reluctant to trust him until Hinx and his forces abduct her. Bond rescues Swann, earning him her trust. Q reveals Le Chiffre, Dominic Greene and Raoul Silva as agents of Oberhauser's organization, which Swann reveals is named Spectre. Swann takes Bond to L'Américain, a hotel in Tangier, where a secret room directs them to Oberhauser's base in the Sahara. Hinx ambushes them en route to the base, but they fight him off and defeat him.\n\n\nArriving at the base, Bond and Swann confront Oberhauser, who reveals Spectre's involvement in the Joint Intelligence Service and the Nine Eyes programme. C, complicit in Spectre's scheme, plans to give Spectre unrestricted access to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes. After showing Swann a distressing recording of her father's suicide, Oberhauser subjects Bond to neurosurgical torture. He discusses his shared past with Bond to Swann, revealing that they became adoptive brothers after Bond's parents died. Falsely believing that his father loved Bond more than him, Oberhauser killed him and staged his death as well. Since then, he founded Spectre intending to target Bond and adopted the name Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Bond and Swann break free, stun Blofeld with an explosive wristwatch, and destroy the base before fleeing to London to prevent Nine Eyes from going online.\n\n\nIn London, Bond, Swann, M, Q, Bill Tanner and Moneypenny gather to arrest C. However, Swann and Bond are separately abducted by Spectre operatives while the others proceed with the plan. After Q stops Nine Eyes from going online, a fatal struggle between M and C results in C's death. Bond is taken to the ruins of the old MI6 building, scheduled for demolition after Silva's bombing,[N 2] where Swann is held captive. Blofeld, who survived the base's destruction with heavy scarring to his face, gives Bond a three-minute ultimatum to abandon Swann or attempt a rescue and risk death. Bond finds Swann and they escape as the building collapses. Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter, which crashes onto Westminster Bridge. Blofeld survives and is arrested by M.\n\n\nLater, Bond receives his restored Aston Martin DB5 from Q and drives off with Swann.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Daniel Craig as James Bond, agent 007. The director Sam Mendes has described Bond as being extremely focused in *Spectre*, likening his new-found dedication to hunting.[15]\n* Christoph Waltz as Ernst Stavro Blofeld (born Franz Oberhauser), Bond's nemesis and the mysterious mastermind behind Spectre, as well as the puppeteer responsible for a series of recent events in Bond's life, motivated by a longstanding grudge against him.\n* Léa Seydoux as Madeleine Swann, a psychiatrist working at a private medical clinic in the Austrian Alps,[16] and the daughter of Mr White.[17]\n* Ben Whishaw as Q, MI6 quartermaster who outfits Bond with equipment for use in the field.\n* Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny, a former agent who left the field to become M's assistant.\n* Dave Bautista as Mr. Hinx, Spectre's top assassin.[18]\n* Andrew Scott as Max Denbigh \"C\", head of the new joint intelligence service and an agent for Spectre, heavily involved with their plan to merge nine national intelligence agencies into the Nine Eyes Committee, allowing Spectre to have the power to take over the world.\n* Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner, M's chief of staff.[19]\n* Jesper Christensen as Mr. White, a fugitive from MI6 and a former senior figure in Spectre's Quantum subsidiary, as portrayed in *Casino Royale* and *Quantum of Solace*,[20][21] now dying from thallium poisoning after falling from Spectre's favour over his reservations relating to human trafficking.\n* Monica Bellucci as Lucia Sciarra, the Italian wife of assassin Marco Sciarra.[22]\n* Ralph Fiennes as M (Gareth Mallory), head of MI6.\n* Stephanie Sigman as Estrella, a Mexican agent who accompanies Bond on his mission to assassinate Marco Sciarra.\n* Alessandro Cremona as Marco Sciarra,[23] an Italian Spectre agent whom Bond kills in the pre-title sequence of the movie.\n* Judi Dench as Mallory's predecessor M, who posthumously gives Bond his mission. This film marks Dench's eighth and final appearance as M, 20 years after beginning with *GoldenEye*.[24]\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2013, Mendes said he would not return to direct the next film in the series, then known as *Bond 24*;[25][26] he later recanted and announced that he would return, as he found the script and the plans for the long-term future of the franchise appealing.[27] Nicolas Winding Refn would later reveal that he turned down an offer to direct the film.[28] In directing *Skyfall* and *Spectre*, Mendes became the first director to oversee two successive *Bond* films since John Glen directed five consecutive films, ending with *Licence to Kill* in 1989.[29] Dennis Gassner returned as the film's production designer,[30] while cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema took over from Roger Deakins.[30][31] In July 2015 Mendes noted that the combined crew of *Spectre* numbered over one thousand, making it a larger production than *Skyfall*.[32] Craig is listed as co-producer. He considered the credit a high point of his career, saying, \"I'm just so proud of the fact that my name comes up somewhere else on the titles.\"[33]\n\n\nThe film's usage of the Spectre organisation[N 3] and its characters marked the end of long-standing litigation between Eon Productions and producer Kevin McClory, who sued James Bond creator Ian Fleming in 1961 claiming ownership over elements of the novel *Thunderball*,[34] and in an out of court settlement two years later, was awarded the novel's film rights, including Spectre and its characters.[N 4] McClory died in 2006, and in November 2013 MGM and the McClory estate formally settled the issue with Danjaq, sister company of Eon Productions—with MGM acquiring the full copyright film rights to the concept of Spectre and all of the characters associated with it.[36] It has been suggested that with the acquisition of the film rights and the organisation's re-introduction to the series' continuity, the SPECTRE acronym was discarded and the organisation reimagined as \"Spectre\".[37][38][39]\n\n\nWhen Sony Pictures Entertainment renegotiated with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures the deal to co-finance the *Bond* franchise in 2011, they were tasked to provide 25% of the negative cost of both *Skyfall* and *Spectre*, in exchange for receiving 25% of the profits plus distribution fees for overseeing its worldwide rollout. When the film was announced in June 2013, the budget was not yet fixed, but was certain to be higher than the $210 million of *Skyfall* due to foreign locations and bigger payments for Mendes and Craig.[40] In November 2014, Sony was targeted by hackers who released details of confidential e-mails between Sony executives regarding several high-profile film projects. Included within these were several memos relating to the production of *Spectre*, claiming that the film was over budget, detailing early drafts of the script written by John Logan, and expressing Sony's frustration with the project.[41] Eon Productions later issued a statement confirming the leak of what they called \"an early version of the screenplay\".[42] Eon resisted Sony and MGM's arguments to cut down on stunts and location work to reduce the budget, but managed to secure tax incentives and rebates, such as $14 million from Mexico. *Spectre* has a final budget estimated between $250 million and $275 million.[40]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\n*Spectre* marked the return of many scriptwriters from the previous *Bond* films, such as *Skyfall* writer John Logan;[29] Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who had done work in five previous *Bond* films,[N 5] and British playwright Jez Butterworth, who had previously made uncredited contributions to *Skyfall*. Butterworth was brought in to polish the script, being helped by Mendes and Craig. Butterworth considered that his changes involved adding what he would like to see as a teenager, and limited the scenes with Bond talking to men, as \"Bond shoots other men—he doesn't sit around chatting to them. So you put a line through that.\"[44] With the acquisition of the rights to Spectre and its associated characters, Purvis and Wade revealed that the film would provide a minor retcon to the continuity of the previous films, with the Quantum organisation alluded to in *Casino Royale* and introduced in *Quantum of Solace* reimagined as a division within Spectre rather than an independent organisation which is implied to be no longer active by the film's events. The plot of *Spectre* also linked the events of *Skyfall* to Craig's first two *Bond* movies by revealing antagonist Raoul Silva to be associated with Spectre reverting *Skyfall*'s initial solo story status.[45] Various plot ideas were discussed and discarded during the writing process; Ralph Fiennes revealed in a 2021 podcast interview that at one stage Sam Mendes suggested a plot twist revealing M to be the villain, which Fiennes vetoed. Another draft by John Logan had MI6 chief of staff Bill Tanner uncovered as a Spectre mole.[46][47][48]\n\n\nDespite being an original story, *Spectre* draws on Ian Fleming's source material, most notably in the character of Franz Oberhauser, played by Christoph Waltz, and his father Hannes. Hannes Oberhauser is a background character in the short story \"Octopussy\" from the *Octopussy and The Living Daylights* collection, and is named in the film as having been a temporary legal guardian of a young Bond in 1983.[49] As Sam Mendes searched for events in young Bond's life to follow the childhood discussed in *Skyfall*, he came across Hannes Oberhauser, who becomes a father figure to Bond. From there, Mendes conceived the idea of \"a natural child who had been pushed out, cuckoo in the nest\" by Bond, which became Franz.[50] Similarly, Charmian Bond is shown to have been his full-time guardian, observing the back story established by Fleming.[49]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)At the age of 50, Monica Bellucci became the oldest actress to be cast as a Bond girl.\nThe main cast was revealed in December 2014 at the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios. Daniel Craig returned for his fourth appearance as James Bond, while Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw reprised their roles as M, Eve Moneypenny and Q respectively, having been established in *Skyfall*. Rory Kinnear also reprised his role as Bill Tanner in his third appearance in the series.[51]\n\n\nChristoph Waltz was cast in the role of Franz Oberhauser, though he refused to comment on the nature of the part.[52] It was later revealed with the film's release that he is Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Waltz got interested in the film for dealing with technology-assisted mass surveillance, \"speaking about relevant social issues in a way that few *Bonds* have done before\", and denied rumours that the role was written specially for him, but added that \"when I came on board, the role grew, evolved, and mutated.\"[53]\n\n\nDave Bautista was cast as Mr Hinx after producers sought an actor with a background in contact sports.[54] The character only has one line in the entire film, \"Shit\". Sam Mendes thought the silent nature would drive Bautista away, but the lifelong Bond fan expressed interest in reviving the quiet henchman archetype of characters such as Jaws. Bautista's performance was inspired mostly by Oddjob from *Goldfinger*,[55] and said not talking created an acting challenge, \"trying to find this way where I am actually going to have to speak without speaking.\"[56] After casting Bérénice Marlohe, a relative newcomer, as Sévérine in *Skyfall*, Mendes sought out a more experienced actor for the role of Madeleine Swann, ultimately casting Léa Seydoux in the role.[57] Monica Bellucci joined the cast as Lucia Sciarra, becoming, at the age of fifty, the oldest actress to be cast as a Bond girl. She had previously auditioned for the role of Paris Carver in *Tomorrow Never Dies*, but was passed over in favour of Teri Hatcher.[58] In a separate interview with Danish website Euroman, Jesper Christensen revealed he would be reprising his role as Mr White from *Casino Royale* and *Quantum of Solace*.[20][21] Christensen's character was reportedly killed off in a scene intended to be used as an epilogue to *Quantum of Solace*, before it was removed from the final cut of the film, enabling his return in *Spectre*.[59]\n\n\nIn addition to the principal cast, Alessandro Cremona was cast as Marco Sciarra, Stephanie Sigman was cast as Estrella, and Detlef Bothe was cast as a villain for scenes shot in Austria.[23][60][61] In February 2015 over 1,500 background artistes were hired for the pre-title sequence set in Mexico, though they were replicated in the film, giving the effect of around 10,000 extras.[62][63][16][64]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nMendes revealed that production would begin on 8 December 2014 at Pinewood Studios, with filming taking seven months.[65] Mendes also confirmed several filming locations, including London, Mexico City and Rome. Van Hoytema shot the film mostly on Kodak 35mm film stock (in addition to digital cameras such as the 6K Arri Alexa 65mm[66]), in contrast to *Skyfall* being filmed solely on digital cameras.[67] Early filming took place at Pinewood Studios, and around London, with scenes variously featuring Craig and Harris at Bond's flat, and Craig and Kinnear travelling down the River Thames.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAfter being cancelled in 2012, the Jaguar C-X75 was recommissioned to appear in *Spectre*.\n![](image)\nThe Aston Martin DB10 is driven by Bond in the film.\n![](image)\nThe Aston Martin DB5 reappears after reconstruction in Q's workshop at the film's ending, with Bond driving away with it.\n\nFilming was carried out in Austria between December 2014 and February 2015, with production taking place in the area around Sölden—including the Ötztal Glacier Road, Rettenbach glacier and the adjacent ski resort plus cable car station—Obertilliach and Lake Altaussee.[69][70][71] Scenes filmed in Austria centred on the Ice Q Restaurant, standing in for the fictional Hoffler Klinik, a private medical clinic in the Austrian Alps. Filming included an action scene featuring a Land Rover Defender Bigfoot and a Range Rover Sport.[72] Various airplane models were used in filming, from a life-sized plane with detachable wings to film the crash in the woods, to plane fuselages either built atop snowmobiles or shot from nitrogen cannons.[73] Production was temporarily halted first by an injury to Craig, who suffered a meniscus tear whilst shooting a fight scene with Bautista,[74][75] and later by an accident involving a filming vehicle that saw three crew members injured, at least one of them seriously.[76][77]\n\n\nFilming temporarily returned to England to shoot scenes at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, which stood in for a location in Rome, before moving on to the city itself for a five-week shoot across the city, with locations including the Ponte Sisto bridge and the Roman Forum.[78] The production faced opposition from a variety of special interest groups and city authorities, who were concerned about the potential for damage to historical sites around the city, and problems with graffiti and rubbish appearing in the film.[79][80] Special effects supervisor Chris Corbould stated the scenes had to be extensively planned prior to filming specially to avoid any mishaps, going to the point of building protection above steps where cars would drive.[73] A car chase scene set along the banks of the Tiber River and through the streets of Rome[81] featured an Aston Martin DB10 (a model developed especially for the film, with only 10 examples produced[82]) and a Jaguar C-X75.[72] The C-X75 was originally developed as a hybrid electric vehicle with four independent electric engines powered by two jet turbines, before the project was cancelled.[83] The version used for filming was converted to use a conventional internal combustion engine, to minimise the potential for disruption from mechanical problems with the complex hybrid system. The C-X75s used for filming were developed by the engineering division of Formula One racing team Williams, who built the original C-X75 prototype for Jaguar.[84] Remote driving pods were built above the cars so the vehicles could be driven while the cameras focused on Craig and Bautista at the steering wheel.[73] According to chief stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell, filming the chase had the \"risk of skidding into the Vatican\", and led to \"a record for smashing up cars in *Spectre*—seven Aston Martins in all,\" with the film's car expenses estimated at £24 million ($48 million).[85]\n\n\nWith filming completed in Rome, production moved to Mexico City in late March to shoot the film's opening sequence, with scenes to include the Day of the Dead festival filmed in and around the Zócalo and the Centro Histórico district.[86] At the time, no such Day of the Dead parade like the one from the film took place in Mexico City; in 2016, due to the interest raised by *Spectre* and the government's desire to promote the pre-Hispanic Mexican culture, the federal and local authorities decided to organise an actual \"Día de Muertos\" parade through Paseo de la Reforma and Centro Histórico on 29 October 2016, which was attended by 250,000 people.[87][88] The film opens with a long take that joins six shots seamlessly, and was one of the few scenes that required previsualisation. Through extensive planning, filming did not require motion control cameras. The scene joints were done in post-production through re-timing and re-projections, which even matched Mexico locations with interiors filmed at Pinewood.[73]\n\n\n\n![](image)Filming of the Mexico City scenes, revolving around a Day of the Dead parade\nThe planned scenes required the city square to be closed for filming a sequence involving a fight aboard a Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm Bo 105CBS helicopter flown by stunt pilot Chuck Aaron,[89] which called for modifications to be made to several buildings to prevent damage.[90] This particular scene in Mexico required 1,500 extras, 10 giant skeletons and 250,000 paper flowers.[91] Reports in the Mexican media added that the film's second unit would move to Palenque in the state of Chiapas, to film aerial manoeuvres considered too dangerous to shoot in an urban area.[92] These were pasted over a computer-generated square and crowd below the helicopter, with motion capture doubles fighting inside. Mendes and the effects team felt that this approach \"would get believable composition and movement\" compared to adding a digital helicopter above the Mexico City location.[93] Following filming in Mexico, and during a scheduled break, Craig was flown to New York to undergo minor surgery to fix his knee injury. It was reported that filming was not affected and he had returned to filming at Pinewood Studios as planned on 22 April.[94] Nonetheless, some parts of the Mexico scene were done with stunt doubles, whose faces were digitally replaced with Craig's.[73]\n\n\nOn 17 May 2015 filming took place on the Thames in London. Stunt scenes involving Craig and Seydoux on a speedboat as well as a low flying helicopter near Westminster Bridge were shot at night, with filming temporarily closing both Westminster and Lambeth Bridges. Scenes were also shot on the river near MI6's headquarters at Vauxhall Cross.[95] The crew returned to the river less than a week later to film scenes solely set on Westminster Bridge. The London Fire Brigade was on set to simulate rain as well as monitor smoke used for filming. Craig, Seydoux, and Waltz, as well as Harris and Fiennes, were seen being filmed.[96] Prior to this, scenes involving Fiennes were shot at a restaurant in Covent Garden.[97] Blofeld's helicopter crash was done with two full sized helicopter shells, which were rigged with steelwork and an overhead track. Computer-generated rotor blades and scenery damage were added in post-production. The MI6 building, which in the film is vacated and scheduled for demolition following the terrorist attack from *Skyfall*, was replaced in the production plates for a digital reconstruction. When the building is detonated, it is a combination of both a miniature and a breakaway version of the digital building.[73]\n\n\nAfter wrapping up in England, production travelled to Morocco in June, with filming taking place in Oujda, Tangier and Erfoud, after preliminary work was completed by the production's second unit.[98] The headquarters of Spectre in Morocco was located in Gara Medouar which is a 'crater' caused by erosion and of neither volcanic nor impact origin.[99] An explosion filmed in Morocco holds a Guinness World Record for the largest film stunt explosion in cinematic history, involving 8,140 litres of kerosene and 24 charges each with a kilogramme of high explosives.[100] The outside shots of a train in a desert featured the Oriental Desert Express.[101] Principal photography concluded on 5 July 2015. A wrap-up party for *Spectre* was held in commemoration before entering post-production.[102] Filming took 128 days.[103]\n\n\nWhilst filming in Mexico City, speculation in the media claimed that the script had been altered to accommodate the demands of Mexican authorities—reportedly influencing details of the scene and characters, casting choices, and modifying the script to portray the country in a \"positive light\"—to secure tax concessions and financial support worth up to $20 million for the film.[104] This was denied by producer Michael G. Wilson,[104] who stated that the scene had always been intended to be shot in Mexico as production had been attracted to the imagery of the Day of the Dead, and that the script had been developed from there.[105] Production of *Skyfall* had previously faced similar problems while attempting to secure permits to shoot the film's pre-title sequence in India before moving to Istanbul.[106][107]\n\n\nFive companies did the visual effects—Industrial Light & Magic, Double Negative, Moving Picture Company, Cinesite and Peerless—under the supervision of Steve Begg. The computer-generated effects included set extensions, digital touches on the vehicles, and crumbling buildings.[73][93] A sixth one, Framestore, handled the title sequence, the seventh in the series designed by Daniel Kleinman. It took four months to complete, and centred on an octopus motif reminiscent of the Spectre logo, along with images of love and relationships.[108]\n\n\n\n### Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spectre (soundtrack)\n\nThomas Newman returned as *Spectre*'s composer.[30] Rather than composing the score once the film had moved into post-production, Newman worked during filming.[64] The theatrical trailer released in July 2015 contained a rendition of John Barry's *On Her Majesty's Secret Service* theme.[109][110] Mendes stated that the final film would have more than 100 minutes of music.[32] The soundtrack album was released on 23 October 2015 in the UK and 6 November 2015 in the US on Decca Records.[111][112]\n\n\nThe English band Radiohead were commissioned to write the title song, and submitted \"Man of War\", an unreleased song written in the 1990s.[113] It was rejected as it had not been written for the film and so was ineligible for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.[114] Radiohead recorded another song for the film, \"Spectre\", but this was also rejected as too melancholy.[115][114]\n\n\nIn September 2015, Eon announced that Sam Smith had recorded the title theme, \"Writing's on the Wall\".[116] Smith reported writing the song in a single session with regular collaborator Jimmy Napes in under half an hour before recording a demo. Satisfied with the quality, the filmmakers used the demo in the final release.[117] \"Writing's on the Wall\" was released as a download on 25 September 2015.[118] It received mixed reviews from critics and fans, particularly in comparison to Adele's \"Skyfall\",[119][120][121][122] leading to Shirley Bassey trending on Twitter on the day it was released.[106][123] Despite the mixed reception, it became the first Bond theme to reach number one in the UK Singles Chart,[124] the second to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song,[125] and the fifth to be nominated.[126][127][N 6] It also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards.[128]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Williams FW37 of Felipe Massa (front) carrying the 007 logo on its wing mirrors at the 2015 Mexican Grand Prix\nDuring the December 2014 press conference announcing the start of filming, Aston Martin and Eon unveiled the new DB10 as the official car for the film. The DB10 was designed in collaboration between Aston Martin and the filmmakers, with only 10 being produced especially for *Spectre* as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the company's association with the franchise.[129] Only eight of those 10 were used for the film, however; the remaining two were used for promotional work.[130] After modifying the Jaguar C-X75 for the film, Williams F1 carried the 007 logo on their cars at the 2015 Mexican Grand Prix, with the team playing host to the cast and crew ahead of the Mexican premiere of the film.[131][132]\n\n\nTo promote the film, the film's marketers continued the trend established during *Skyfall*'s production of releasing still images of clapperboards and video blogs on Eon's official social media accounts.[133][134]\n\n\nOn 13 March 2015, several members of the cast and crew, including Craig, Whishaw, Wilson and Mendes, as well as previous James Bond actor, Sir Roger Moore, appeared in a sketch written by David Walliams and the Dawson Brothers for Comic Relief's Red Nose Day on BBC One. In the sketch, they film a behind-the-scenes documentary on the filming of *Spectre*.[135][136] The first teaser trailer for *Spectre* was released worldwide in March 2015,[137] followed by the theatrical trailer in July[138] and the final trailer in October.[139]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daniel Craig, producer Barbara Broccoli, Naomie Harris and Christoph Waltz in a premiere for *Spectre* in Berlin\n*Spectre* had its world premiere at the Royal Film Performance, an event in aid of the Film & TV Charity, in London on 26 October 2015 at the Royal Albert Hall, the same day as its general release in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.[140][141] It was released in the United States on 6 November.[*citation needed*] Following the announcement of the start of filming, Paramount Pictures brought forward the release of *Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation* to avoid competing with *Spectre*.[142] In March 2015 IMAX corporation announced that *Spectre* would be screened in its cinemas, following *Skyfall*'s success with the company.[143] In the UK it received a wider release than *Skyfall*, with a minimum of 647 cinemas including 40 IMAX screens, compared to *Skyfall*'s 587 locations and 21 IMAX screens.[144]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Spectre* was released for Digital HD on 22 January 2016 and on DVD and Blu-ray on 9 and 22 February 2016 in the US and UK respectively.[145] It debuted atop the home video charts in both countries,[146][147] and finished 2016 with 1.5 million units in the UK, the second best-selling title of the year, behind only *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*,[148] and 2 million copies in the US, 12th in the year-end charts.[149]\n\n\nThe film was later released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on 22 October 2019 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment along with the previous three films, and standalone on 25 February 2020 in the US and 23 March 2020 in the UK.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Spectre* grossed $880.7 million worldwide; $135.5 million of the takings were generated from the UK market and $200.1 million from North America.[14] Worldwide, this made it the second-highest-grossing *James Bond* film after *Skyfall*,[150] and the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2015.[151] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $98.4 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it sixteenth on their list of 2015's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[152] Sony had expected the net profit of the film to be around $38 million had it performed to the same level of its predecessor, but it earned 20% less than *Skyfall*.[153] Sony paid 50% of the production costs for the film—which totalled some $250 million after accounting for government incentives—but received only 25% of certain profits, once costs were recouped. The studio also spent tens of millions of dollars in marketing and had to give MGM some of the profit from the studio's non-Bond films, including *22 Jump Street*.[153]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film grossed £4.1 million ($6.4 million) from its Monday preview screenings.[154] It grossed £6.3 million ($9.2 million) on its opening day[155] and then £5.7 million ($8.8 million) on Wednesday, setting UK records for both days.[156] In the film's first seven days it grossed £41.7 million ($63.8 million), breaking the UK record for highest first-week opening, set by *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*'s £23.9 million ($36.9 million) in 2004.[157] Its Friday–Saturday gross was £20.4 million ($31.2 million) compared to *Skyfall*'s £20.1 million ($31 million). The film also broke the record for the best per-screen opening average with $110,000, a record previously held by *The Dark Knight* with $100,200.[158] It has grossed a total of $136.3 million there.[159] In the UK, it surpassed *Avatar* to become the country's highest-grossing IMAX release ever with $10.09 million.[160]\n\n\n*Spectre* opened in Germany with $22.5 million (including previews), which included a new record for the biggest Saturday of all time,[161] Australia with $8.7 million (including previews) and South Korea opened to $8.2 million (including previews).[162] Despite the 13 November Paris attacks, which led to numerous theatres being closed down, the film opened with $14.6 million (including $2 million in previews) in France.[163] In Mexico, where part of the film was shot, it debuted with more than double that of *Skyfall* with $4.5 million.[161] It also bested its predecessor's opening in various Nordic regions where MGM is distributing, such as in Finland ($2.7 million) and Norway ($2.9 million),[164] and in other markets like Denmark ($4.2 million), the Netherlands ($3.4 million), and Sweden ($3.1 million).[164] In India, it opened at No. 1 with $4.8 million which is 4% above the opening of *Skyfall*.[165] It topped the German-speaking Switzerland box office for four weeks and in the Netherlands, it held the No. 1 spot for seven weeks straight where it topped *Minions* to become the top movie of the year.[159][166] The top earning markets are Germany ($70.3 million) and France ($38.8 million).[167] In Paris, it has the second-highest ticket sales of all time with 4.1 million tickets sold only behind *Spider-Man 3* which sold over 6.3 million tickets in 2007.[168]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada the film opened on 6 November 2015, and in its opening weekend, was originally projected to gross $70–75 million from 3,927 screens, the widest release for a Bond film.[169] However, after it grossed $5.3 million from its early Thursday night showings and $28 million on its opening day, weekend projections were increased to $75–80 million. The film ended up grossing $70.4 million in its opening weekend (about $20 million less than *Skyfall'*s $90.6 million debut, including IMAX previews), but nevertheless finished first at the box office.[170] IMAX generated $9.1 million for *Spectre* at 374 screens, premium large format made $8 million from 429 cinemas, reaping 11% of the film's opening, which means that *Spectre* earned $17.1 million (23%) of its opening weekend total in large-format venues. Cinemark XD generated $1.9 million in 112 XD locations.[170][171]\n\n\nIn China, it opened on 12 November and earned $15 million on its opening day, which is the second biggest 2D single day gross for a Hollywood film behind the $18.5 million opening day of *Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation* and occupying 43% of all available screens which included $790,000 in advance night screenings.[172] Through its opening weekend, it earned $48.1 million from 14,700 screens which is 198% ahead of *Skyfall*,[162] a new record for a Hollywood 2D opening.[173] IMAX contributed $4.6 million on 246 screens, also a new record for a three-day opening for a November release (breaking *Interstellar*'s record).[162] In its second weekend, it added $12.1 million falling precipitously by 75% which is the second worst second weekend drop for any major Hollywood release in China of 2015.[174] It grossed a total of $84.7 million there after four weekends (foreign films in the Middle Kingdom play for 30 days only, unless granted special extensions).[175] Despite a strong opening, it failed to attain the $100 million mark there as projected due to mixed response from critics and audiences as well as facing competition from local films.[159][176][177]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Spectre* has an approval rating of 63% based on 371 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.4/10. Its critical consensus reads, \"*Spectre* nudges Daniel Craig's rebooted Bond closer to the glorious, action-driven spectacle of earlier entries, although it's admittedly reliant on established 007 formula.\"[178] Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned *Spectre* a score of 60 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[179] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[170]\n\n\n\n![](image)Dave Bautista was praised for his performance as Hinx.\nPrior to its UK release, *Spectre* mostly received positive reviews.[180] Mark Kermode, film critic for *The Observer*, gave the film four out of five stars, observing that the film did not live up to the standard set by *Skyfall*, but was able to tap into audience expectations.[181] Writing in *The Guardian*, Peter Bradshaw gave the film a full five stars, calling it \"inventive, intelligent and complex\", and singling out Craig's performance as the film's highlight.[182] In another five star review, *The Daily Telegraph*'s Robbie Collin described *Spectre* as \"a swaggering show of confidence'\", lauding it as \"a feat of pure cinematic necromancy\".[183] Positive yet critical assessments included Kim Newman of *Sight and Sound*, who wrote that \"for all its wayward plotting (including an unhelpful tie-in with Bond's childhood that makes very little sense) and off-the-peg elements, *Spectre* works\" as he felt \"the audience's patience gets tested by two and a half hours of set-pieces strung on one of the series' thinner plots\";[184] and IGN's Chris Tilly, who rated the film 7.2 out of 10, considering *Spectre* \"solid if unspectacular\", and concluding that \"the film falls frustratingly short of greatness.\"[185]\n\n\nCritical appraisal was mixed in the United States. In a review for RogerEbert.com, Matt Zoller Seitz gave *Spectre* 2.5 out of 4, describing it as inconsistent and unable to capitalise on its potential.[186] Kenneth Turan, reviewing the film for *Los Angeles Times*, concluded that *Spectre* \"comes off as exhausted and uninspired\".[187] Manohla Dargis of *The New York Times* criticised the film as having \"nothing surprising\" and sacrificing its originality for the sake of box office returns.[188] *Forbes'* Scott Mendelson also heavily criticised the film, denouncing *Spectre* as \"the worst 007 movie in 30 years\".[189] Darren Franich of *Entertainment Weekly* viewed *Spectre* as \"an overreaction to our current blockbuster moment\", aspiring \"to be a serialized sequel\" and proving \"itself as a Saga\". While noting that \"[n]othing that happens in *Spectre* holds up to even minor logical scrutiny\", he had \"come not to bury *Spectre*, but to weirdly praise it. Because the final act of the movie is so strange, so willfully obtuse, that it deserves extra attention.\"[190] Christopher Orr, writing in *The Atlantic*, also criticised the film, saying that *Spectre* \"backslides on virtually every [aspect]\".[191] Lawrence Toppman of *The Charlotte Observer* called Craig's performance \"Bored, James Bored.\"[192] Alyssa Rosenberg, writing for *The Washington Post*, stated that the film turned into \"a disappointingly conventional *Bond* film.\"[193]\n\n\nIn a positive review published in *Rolling Stone*, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, describing *Spectre* as \"party time for Bond fans, a fierce, funny, gorgeously produced valentine to the longest-running franchise in movies\".[194] Mick LaSalle from the *San Francisco Chronicle*, raved that \"One of the great satisfactions of *Spectre* is that, in addition to all the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organisation out to steal everyone's personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person.\"[195] Stephen Whitty from *The New York Daily News*, who awarded the film four of five stars, stated that \"Craig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin. And while Lea Seydoux doesn't leave a huge impression as this film's 'Bond girl', perhaps it's because we've already met—far too briefly—the hypnotic Monica Bellucci, as the first real 'Bond woman' since Diana Rigg.\"[196] *Chicago Sun-Times* film reviewer Richard Roeper, who gave the film three stars out of four, considered the film \"solidly in the middle of the all-time rankings, which means it's still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to like it that way.\"[197] Michael Phillips, reviewing for the *Chicago Tribune*, stated, \"For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, *Spectre* works best when everyone's on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes.\"[198] *Variety* film critic Guy Lodge complained in his review that \"What's missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of *Skyfall,* as the film sustains its predecessor's nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent.\"[199]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAccolades received by *Spectre* (2015 film)\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | 28 February 2016 | Best Original Song | Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for \"Writing's on the Wall\"\n | Won\n | [200] |\n| Alliance of Women Film Journalists Awards | 12 January 2016 | Most Egregious Age Difference Between Leading Man and Love Interest\n | Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux | Nominated\n | [201][202] |\n| Art Directors Guild Awards | 31 January 2016 | Excellence in Production Design for a Contemporary Film | Dennis Gassner | Nominated\n | [203] |\n| Critics' Choice Movie Awards | 17 January 2016 | Best Song | \"Writing's on the Wall\"\n | Nominated\n | [204] |\n| Best Actor in an Action Movie | Daniel Craig | Nominated\n |\n| Empire Awards | 20 March 2016 | Best British Film | *Spectre* | Won\n | [205] |\n| Best Thriller | *Spectre* | Won\n |\n| Golden Globe Awards | 10 January 2016 | Best Original Song | Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for \"Writing's on the Wall\"\n | Won\n | [206] |\n| Hollywood Music in Media Awards | 11 November 2015 | Best Original Song in a Feature Film | Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for \"Writing's on the Wall\"\n | Nominated\n | [207][208] |\n| Houston Film Critics Society Awards | 9 January 2016 | Best Original Song\n | \"Writing's on the Wall\"\n | Nominated\n | [209][210] |\n| Japan Academy Film Prize | 4 March 2016 | Outstanding Foreign Language Film | *Spectre* | Nominated\n | [211] |\n| Make-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild Awards | 20 February 2016 | Best Contemporary Hair Styling in a Feature-Length Motion Picture | Zoe Tahir\n | Nominated\n | [212] |\n| Satellite Awards | 21 February 2016 | Best Cinematography | Hoyte van Hoytema | Nominated\n | [213][214] |\n| Best Original Score | Thomas Newman | Nominated\n |\n| Best Original Song | Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for \"Writing's on the Wall\"\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Visual Effects | Steve Begg and Chris Corbould | Nominated\n |\n| Best Art Direction and Production Design | Dennis Gassner | Nominated\n |\n| Best Film Editing | Lee Smith | Nominated\n |\n| Best Sound (Editing and Mixing) | Per Hallberg, Karen Baker Landers, Scott Millan, Gregg Rudloff, and Stuart Wilson | Nominated\n |\n| Saturn Awards | 22 June 2016 | Best Action or Adventure Film | *Spectre* | Nominated\n | [215][216] |\n| St. Louis Film Critics Association Awards | 20 December 2015 | Best Song\n | \"Writing's on the Wall\"\n | Won\n | [217][218] |\n| Teen Choice Awards | 31 July 2016 | Choice Movie: Action | *Spectre* | Nominated\n | [219] |\n| Choice Movie Actress: Action\n | Léa Seydoux | Nominated\n |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The production budget for *Spectre* has been debated. Estimates range from $245–250[6][7][8][9][10] to as high as $300–350 million.[11][12][13] The $350 million figure also incorporates the $100 million marketing budget.[13] $21.5 million was spent on television advertisements and a further $100 million was spent on promotion and advertising.[8]\n2. **^** As depicted in *Skyfall* (2012)\n3. **^** Originally stylised \"SPECTRE\" as an acronym of **SP**ecial **E**xecutive for **C**ounter-intelligence, **T**errorism, **R**evenge and **E**xtortion\n4. **^** Following the settlement, McClory collaborated with Eon to produce the adaptation *Thunderball* (1965), and licensed Spectre and its characters to Eon for ten years,[35] allowing their subsequent appearances in *You Only Live Twice*, *On Her Majesty's Secret Service* and *Diamonds Are Forever*\n5. **^**  Purvis and Wade were credited for the screenplay of *Quantum of Solace*, as they wrote the original draft of the film. However, the final script was written by Paul Haggis, with several uncredited co-writers.[43]\n6. **^** The other four were \"Skyfall\" (2012), \"For Your Eyes Only\" (1981), \"Nobody Does It Better\" (1977), and \"Live and Let Die\" (1973).[126][125]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Dalton, Stephen (21 October 2015). \"'Spectre': Film Review\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

The film is the third to star Daniel Craig as fictional MI6 agent James Bond and features Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva, the villain, with Judi Dench returning as M. Directed by Sam Mendes and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan, the film has Bond investigating a series of targeted data leaks and co-ordinated attacks on MI6 led by Raoul Silva. It sees the return of two recurring characters, Miss Moneypenny (played by Naomie Harris) and Q (played by Ben Whishaw), after an absence of two films. Ralph Fiennes, Bérénice Marlohe, and Albert Finney are among the supporting cast.\n\n\nMendes was approached to direct after the release of *Quantum of Solace* in 2008. Development of the film was suspended throughout 2010 after Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which caused screenwriter Peter Morgan to leave the project. Production resumed in December 2010 after Purvis, Wade, and Logan were hired and a November 2012 release date was announced in January 2011.[5] Principal photography began that November after the film's title was revealed and lasted until March 2012, with filming locations including London, Shanghai, Istanbul, and Scotland.\n\n\n*Skyfall* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall on 23 October 2012, and was released theatrically in conventional and IMAX formats in the United Kingdom three days later and in the United States on 9 November, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the first *James Bond* film *Dr. No* (1962). *Skyfall* received praise for Mendes's direction, cast performances, action sequences, cinematography, and musical score. The film was nominated for five awards at the 85th Academy Awards, winning two, and received numerous other accolades. *Skyfall* grossed $1 billion worldwide, the fourteenth film to do so, and became the then-seventh-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing *James Bond* film, the second-highest-grossing film of 2012, and the then-highest-grossing film released by Sony or MGM. The next film in the series, *Spectre*, was released in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn Istanbul, MI6 agents James Bond and Eve Moneypenny pursue mercenary Patrice, who has stolen a hard drive containing details of undercover agents. As Bond and Patrice fight atop a moving train, M orders Moneypenny to shoot Patrice, despite not having a clear shot; Moneypenny inadvertently hits Bond, who falls into a river. Bond is presumed dead and Patrice escapes with the hard drive.\n\n\nThree months later, due to a public inquiry into M's handling of the stolen hard drive, she is pressured to retire by Gareth Mallory, the chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament and a former SAS officer. Although she claims she is still useful, MI6's servers are hacked, and M receives a taunting computer message moments before the MI6 building explodes. Bond, who used his presumed death to retire, learns of the attack and returns to service in London. He fails a series of physical, medical, and psychological examinations, but M approves his return to the field, ordering him to identify Patrice's employer, recover the hard drive, and kill Patrice. He meets Q, MI6's new quartermaster, who gives him a radio beacon and a Walther PPK pistol.\n\n\nIn Shanghai, Bond follows Patrice and witnesses him killing a target. The two fight and Patrice falls to his death before Bond can learn his employer's identity. Moneypenny joins Bond in his investigation on orders from Mallory. Bond finds a casino token Patrice intended to cash in for the assassination, leading him to a casino in Macau. There, Bond is approached by Sévérine, Patrice's accomplice. Recognising her tattoo, he concludes she was a sex slave \"rescued\" by a criminal who now employs her, a man Bond wishes to meet. She warns him he is targeted by her bodyguards, but promises to help if Bond kills her employer. Bond fends off the attackers, and joins Sévérine on her yacht, the *Chimera*. They travel to an abandoned island off the coast of Macau, where the crew captures and delivers them to Sévérine's employer, Raoul Silva. Once an MI6 agent, Silva turned to cyberterrorism and orchestrated the attack on MI6. Silva kills Sévérine, but Bond alerts MI6 reinforcements who capture Silva for rendition to Britain.\n\n\nAt MI6's new underground headquarters, Q attempts to decrypt Silva's laptop, but inadvertently gives it access to the MI6 servers, allowing Silva to escape. Q concludes Silva wanted to be captured as part of a plan to kill M, whom he hates for disavowing and betraying him to the Chinese government during the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, leaving him to be tortured and disfigured by a suicide attempt by cyanide pill. Silva escapes his cell and Bond chases him through the London Underground and thwarts Silva's attack at a Parliament inquiry where M is present.\n\n\nInstructing Q and Bill Tanner to leave an electronic trail for Silva to follow, Bond uses his Aston Martin DB5 to take M to Skyfall, his childhood home in the Scottish Highlands. They meet Skyfall's gamekeeper Kincade, and together the trio set up a series of booby traps throughout the house. When Silva's men arrive, Bond, M, and Kincade kill most of them, but M is wounded. Silva arrives by helicopter with more men and heavy weapons, so Bond sends M and Kincade through a priest hole to hide in a nearby chapel, and rigs propane tanks to explode. As the house and the helicopter are destroyed, Bond escapes down the same tunnel.\n\n\nSilva survives the destruction of the house, following Kincade and M to the chapel. Confronting M, Silva forces his gun into her hand and presses his temple to hers, begging her to kill them both. Bond arrives and kills Silva by throwing a knife into his back. M then succumbs to her wounds and dies in Bond's arms.\n\n\nFollowing M's funeral, Moneypenny formally introduces herself to Bond and tells him she is retiring from fieldwork to become secretary for Mallory, the newly appointed M. Bond meets with Mallory, and tells him he is ready to get back to work.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Daniel Craig as James Bond, agent 007\n* Judi Dench as M, the head of MI6 and Bond's superior\n* Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva (born Tiago Rodriguez),[6] a cyberterrorist\n* Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory, chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee and a former SAS Lieutenant Colonel\n* Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny, an MI6 field agent\n* Bérénice Marlohe as Sévérine, Raoul Silva's associate and mistress\n* Albert Finney as Kincade, the gamekeeper of the Skyfall estate\n* Ben Whishaw as Q, the MI6 quartermaster\n* Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner, M's chief of staff[7]\n* Ola Rapace as Patrice, a mercenary under Silva's command\n* Helen McCrory as Clair Dowar MP\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nDevelopment of *Bond 23* began in 2009 but was suspended throughout 2010 because of MGM's financial troubles.[8] Preproduction resumed following MGM's exit from bankruptcy on 21 December 2010, and in January 2011, the film was officially given a release date of 9 November 2012 by MGM and the Broccoli family, with production scheduled to start in late 2011. Subsequently, MGM and Sony Pictures announced that the UK release date would be brought forward to 26 October 2012, two weeks ahead of the US release date, which remained scheduled for 9 November 2012.[9] The film's budget is estimated to have been between US$150 million[10][11] and $200 million,[4] compared to the $200 million spent on *Quantum of Solace*.[12] *Skyfall* was part of year-long celebrations of the 50th anniversary of *Dr. No* and the Bond film series.\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nAfter the release of *Quantum of Solace* in 2008, producer Barbara Broccoli commented that *Skyfall*, untitled at the time, may continue the plot of the Quantum organisation, introduced in *Casino Royale* and continued in *Quantum of Solace*.[13]\n\n\nIn August 2011, the Serbian newspaper *Blic* stated that *Bond 23* would be titled *Carte Blanche* and would be an adaptation of the recent continuation novel by Jeffery Deaver.[14] On 30 August, Eon Productions officially denied any link between *Bond 23* and *Carte Blanche*, stating that \"the new film is not going to be called *Carte Blanche* and will have nothing to do with the Jeffery Deaver book\".[15] On 3 October 2011, fifteen domain names including *jamesbond-skyfall.com* and *skyfallthefilm.com* were reported to have been registered on behalf of MGM and Sony Pictures by Internet brand-protection service MarkMonitor. *Skyfall* was confirmed as the title at a press conference on 3 November 2011, during which co-producer Barbara Broccoli said that the title \"has some emotional context which will be revealed in the film\".[16] The title refers to the name of Bond's childhood home, \"Skyfall\", and the setting for the film's finale.[17]\n\n\n\n#### Casting[edit]\n\n\nThe main cast was announced at a press conference held at the Corinthia Hotel in London on 3 November 2011,[18] fifty years after Sean Connery had been announced as James Bond in the film *Dr. No*.[19] Daniel Craig returned as James Bond for the third time,[20] saying he felt lucky to have the chance.[21] Mendes described Bond as experiencing a \"combination of lassitude, boredom, depression [and] difficulty with what he's chosen to do for a living\".[22] Judi Dench returned as M for her seventh and final time.[23] Over the course of the film, M's ability to run MI6 is called into question, culminating in a public inquiry into her running of the service.\n\n\nJavier Bardem was cast as the principal villain, Raoul Silva, a cyberterrorist seeking revenge against those he holds responsible for betraying him.[24][25] Bardem described Silva as \"more than a villain\", while Craig stated that Bond has a \"very important relationship\" to Silva.[26] Mendes admitted that he had lobbied hard for Bardem to accept the part, and saw potential for the character to be recognised as one of the most memorable in the series. He wanted to create \"something [the audience] may consider to have been absent from the Bond movies for a long time\",[27] and felt that Bardem was one of the few actors able to become \"colourless\" and exist as more than just a function of the plot.[28] In preparing for the role, Bardem had the script translated into his native Spanish, which Mendes cited as a sign of his commitment.[29] Bardem dyed his hair blond for the role, after brainstorming ideas for a distinct visual look with Mendes,[30] which led some commentators to suggest a resemblance to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.[31][32][33] Bérénice Marlohe was cast as Séverine, saved from the Macau sex trade by Silva and now working as his representative.[34][35] Marlohe described her character as being \"glamorous and enigmatic\",[20] and that she drew inspiration from *GoldenEye* villain Xenia Onatopp (played by Famke Janssen).[36]\n\n\nRalph Fiennes was cast as Gareth Mallory,[37] a former lieutenant colonel in the British Army and now Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee,[38] which regulates MI6.[39] At the end of the film, Mallory becomes the head of MI6, assuming the title of 'M'. During production, Fiennes stated that he could not say anything specific about the role other than that it was a \"really interesting part which is really quite fun\".[40] Fiennes had previously been considered to play Bond during the casting of *GoldenEye*.[41][42] Naomie Harris was cast as the returning character of Miss Moneypenny.[33] Harris's role was initially presented as that of Eve, an MI6 field agent who works closely with Bond. Despite media speculation that Harris had been cast as Miss Moneypenny,[43][44] this was not confirmed by anyone involved in production, with Harris herself dismissing claims that Eve was in fact Moneypenny.[45] According to Harris, Eve \"[believes] she is Bond's equal, but she is really his junior\".[46] Another returning character was Q, played by Ben Whishaw.[47] Mendes had initially declined to confirm which part Whishaw would play,[20] and later said the idea of the re-introduction was his, saying, \"I offered ideas about Moneypenny, Q and a flamboyant villain and they said yes\". To play the part of Kincade, Mendes cast Albert Finney.[48] The producers briefly considered approaching Sean Connery to play the role in a nod to the 50th anniversary of the series, but decided not to as they felt Connery's presence would have been seen as stunt casting and might disengage the audience.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Crew[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director Sam Mendes at the film's premiere in Paris, October 2012\nMendes first signed on to direct the project shortly after *Quantum of Solace* was released, and remained as a consultant during the uncertainty surrounding MGM's financial situation. Mendes, who had previously worked with Craig on *Road to Perdition*, was approached after seeing Craig in *A Steady Rain*, meeting after a performance, where Craig broached the subject of directing a *Bond* film for the first time.[50] He was at first hesitant, as the job had little appeal to him, but he did not reject the offer immediately because of Craig's involvement and enthusiasm; Mendes described Craig's casting and performance in *Casino Royale* as being what he felt the *Bond* franchise needed. He agreed to direct after meeting producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and seeing the early direction the film was going to take.[50] Media speculation was that Mendes had commissioned rewrites of the script to \"[remove] action scenes in favour of 'characterful performances'\" with the hope of securing an Academy Award.[51] Mendes denied this, saying that the action scenes were an important part of the film.[19]\n\n\nRoger Deakins signed on as cinematographer, having previously worked with Mendes on *Jarhead* and *Revolutionary Road*.[52] Dennis Gassner returned as production designer, the costume designer was Jany Temime, Alexander Witt was director of the second unit, the stunt co-ordinator was Gary Powell and Chris Corbould supervised the special effects, while the visual effects supervisor was Steve Begg. All had worked on previous *Bond* films.[5] Daniel Kleinman returned to design the title sequence after stepping aside to allow graphic design studio MK12 to create the *Quantum of Solace* sequence.[53]\n\n\n\n#### Writing[edit]\n\n\nPeter Morgan was originally commissioned to write a script, but left the project when MGM filed for bankruptcy and production of the film stalled; despite his departure, Morgan later stated that the final script was based on his original idea, retaining what he described as its \"big hook\".[54] Mendes denied this as \"just not true\", insisting that Morgan's approach had been discarded once he had agreed to direct.[55] Robert Wade later said that \"Neal and I were pretty steeped in Fleming. I think Peter was more interested in Le Carré. It just didn't work.\"[56] Morgan cowrote the treatment *Once Upon a Spy* with Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, which had M being blackmailed by a Russian oligarch, who would be a former KGB agent she had an affair with while stationed in West Berlin during the Cold War. The script would have ended with Bond being forced to kill M.[57][58][42] Mendes disliked most of the script but asked to keep the ending with M's death.[57]\n\n\nPurvis and Wade then wrote a new script drawing from *You Only Live Twice* (1964) and *The Man with the Golden Gun* (1965), in which Bond is presumed dead after an accident and travels back to London to an uncertain MI6. The original screenplay would have more closely followed the literary series' story arc with Bond becoming an amnesiac and unknowingly impregnating his lover Lily in Turkey, who would have tracked him down to London after he returned to MI6. It would have featured Bond tracking down a Francisco Scaramanga-esque villain into the Andes Mountains, and would have had a \"*Heart of Darkness* feel.\"[59] The screenplay was delayed because of MGM's financial problems. At the end of 2010, Purvis and Wade completed a draft titled *Nothing is Forever* in which a villain called Raoul Sousa kills M with a bombing aboard the Barcelona Metro and leaves a bureaucrat named Mallender as the new M. They still disliked the third act, and so later revised it to include the ending in Scotland.[60] The final script was rewritten by John Logan, who kept most of Purvis and Wade's basic story.[61] Logan recounted being brought into the project by his long-time friend Mendes, describing the process between Mendes and the writers as \"very collaborative\", and that writing *Skyfall* was one of the best experiences he had had in scripting.[62] British playwright Jez Butterworth also provided uncredited contributions.[63]\n\n\n\n#### Location scouting[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2011, Mendes and Broccoli travelled to South Africa for location scouting.[64] With the film moving into pre-production in August, reports emerged that shooting would take place in India,[65] with scenes to be shot in the Sarojini Nagar district of New Delhi[66] and on railway lines between Goa and Ahmedabad.[67] The production crew faced complications in securing permission to close sections of the Konkan Railway.[68] Similar problems in obtaining filming permits were encountered by production crews for *The Dark Knight Rises* and *Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol*.[69] Permission was eventually granted to the Bond production crew; the production ultimately did not shoot in India.[70]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Aston Martin DB5 featured in the film\n![](image)The MI6 Building in London\nPrincipal photography was scheduled to take up to 133 days,[71] although actually took 128.[72] It began on 7 November 2011 in London,[19][73] with Deakins using Arri Alexa digital cameras to shoot the entire film. It was the first Bond film to be shot digitally.[74] Scenes were shot in London Underground stations,[75] Smithfield car park in West Smithfield,[76] the National Gallery, Southwark,[77] Whitehall, Parliament Square,[78] Charing Cross station,[79] the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich,[80] Cadogan Square[76] and Tower Hill.[81] St Bartholomew's Hospital[77] was used for the scene in which Bond enters MI6's underground headquarters, while the Old Vic Tunnels underneath Waterloo Station served as the MI6 training grounds. The meeting between Q and Bond was filmed when the National Gallery was closed at night.\n\n\nThe Department of Energy and Climate Change offices were used for the scene near the end, when Bond stands on the roof.[76][82] Vauxhall Bridge and Millbank were closed to traffic for filming the explosion at the MI6 headquarters at Vauxhall Cross.[82] Unlike for *The World Is Not Enough*, which featured an explosion at the building filmed at a large-scale replica, this explosion was added digitally during post-production.[83] The finale was planned for Duntrune Castle in Argyll,[84] but shortly after filming began[85] the location was changed to Glencoe.[82] Although supposedly in Scotland, Bond's family home was constructed on Hankley Common in Surrey[86] using a plywood and plaster full-scale model of the building.[87]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Varda Viaduct was used for the scene in which Bond is shot.\nProduction moved to Turkey in March 2012, with filming continuing until 6 May.[88][89] Adana stands in for the outskirts of Istanbul.[90] Some Turkish teenagers infiltrated a closed set in railway sidings in Adana, during film rehearsals of the fight on top of a train, before they were caught by security.[91] The train scene depicted in trailers showed the Varda Viaduct outside Adana, during which Bond stunt double Andy Lister dived backwards off the 300-foot (91 m) drop, with a crane on a train carriage holding a safety line.[82] Parts of Istanbul—including the Spice Bazaar, Yeni Camii, the Grand Post Office, Sultanahmet Square and the Grand Bazaar—were closed for filming in April.[88] Affected store owners were reportedly allowed to open their shops, but not allowed to conduct business, instead being paid TRY₺750 ($418) per day as compensation.[88] Production was criticised for allegedly damaging buildings while filming a motorcycle chase across rooftops. Wilson denied this, pointing out that the crew had removed sections of rooftop before filming, and replaced them with temporary replicas.[92] The production team negotiated with 613 part-owners of Calis Beach in Fethiye to film along the coastline.[82]\n\n\nMendes confirmed that China would feature in the film, with shooting scheduled for Shanghai and \"other parts\" of the country.[19] Logan asserted that they deliberately sought locations that were \"in opposition\" to London, with an exotic quality as \"places for Bond to be uncomfortable\".[82] Scenes with the principal actors were not filmed on location in Shanghai, but in the UK. The Virgin Active pool in London's Canary Wharf acted as Bond's hotel pool,[77][82] Ascot Racecourse stood in for Shanghai Pudong International Airport,[93][94] and London's Broadgate Tower was used as the entrance and lobby of the Shanghai office building. The Golden Dragon casino in Macau was constructed on a sound stage at Pinewood Studios, with 300 floating lanterns and two 30-foot-high dragon heads lighting the set.[82] The production received permission to shoot second unit aerial footage of Shanghai from a helicopter loaned by the Chinese government.[82] The first official image from the film was released on 1 February 2012, showing Craig on set at Pinewood within a recreation of a Shanghai skyscraper.[95]\n\n\nThe lair of villain Silva was inspired by Hashima, an abandoned island off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan.[96][97] In the film, the fictionalized island is located near Macau. Mendes explained that the sequence was created with a combination of large sets of the city streets and computer-generated establishing shots.[98] The Hashima setting was included after Craig met with Swedish film-maker Thomas Nordanstad while shooting *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo* in Stockholm. Nordanstad, who produced a short 2002 documentary on the island entitled *Hashima*, recalled Craig taking extensive notes during the meeting, but was unaware of his interest in it until *Skyfall* was released.[99]\n\n\nThe film was later converted into the IMAX format for projection in IMAX cinemas. Deakins was unaware that the film was to be released on IMAX until after he had made the decision to shoot the film with the Arri Alexa cameras, and was unhappy with the IMAX tests made from his footage as the colours \"didn't look great\".[74] After exploring the IMAX system further and discovering that the IMAX Corporation was using their proprietary re-mastering process, Deakins had further tests made without the process and found that \"the images looked spectacular on the big IMAX screen\", quelling his doubts about the format.[74]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas Newman composed the film's score.\nMain article: Skyfall (soundtrack)\n\nThomas Newman, who had previously worked with Mendes as composer for *American Beauty*, *Road to Perdition*, *Jarhead* and *Revolutionary Road*, replaced David Arnold as composer,[100] becoming the ninth composer in the series' history. When asked about the circumstances surrounding his departure from the role, David Arnold commented that Newman had been selected by Mendes because of their work together, rather than because of Arnold's commitment to working with director Danny Boyle as composer for the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics.[101][*non-primary source needed*] The soundtrack album was released on 29 October 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 6 November 2012 in the United States.[102]\n\n\nIn October 2012 British singer-songwriter Adele confirmed that she had written and recorded the film's theme song with her regular songwriter, Paul Epworth.[103][104] She later posted the cover for the \"Skyfall\" sheet music on Twitter, crediting the songwriting to herself and Epworth, with arrangements to both Epworth and orchestrator J. A. C. Redford.[105][*non-primary source needed*] The song was released online at 0:07 am BST on 5 October 2012, a day dubbed \"James Bond Day\" by the producers as it marked 50 years to the day of the release of *Dr. No*.[106]\n\n\nThe song was nominated for and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. It was the first time a Bond song had won, and the fourth time one had been nominated.[107][108][a] \"Skyfall\" also won the Brit Award for Best British Single at the 2013 BRIT Awards.[109]\n\n\nThe film also features Charles Trenet's 1938 song \"Boum !\" during scenes in which Silva shows Bond around his abandoned island, and The Animals' 1964 cover of John Lee Hooker's song, \"Boom Boom\" when Silva assaults Skyfall in the film's finale.[110]\n\n\n\n## Release and reception[edit]\n\n\nThe premiere of *Skyfall* was on 23 October 2012 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The event was attended by Charles, Prince of Wales, and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.[111] Charles asked that money raised at the premiere be donated to charities that served former or serving members of the British intelligence agencies.[112] The film was released in the UK three days later on 26 October and into US cinemas on 8 November.[113] *Skyfall* was the first Bond film to be screened in IMAX venues[114] and was released into IMAX cinemas in North America a day earlier than the conventional cinema release.[115]\n\n\n*Skyfall* attracted some criticism from the US Sexual Violence Resource Center which, without having screened the film, expressed concern that Bond \"abuses his power and authority\" in a scene that suggests Bond initiates sexual intercourse with Sévérine, a former victim of sex trafficking.[116]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Skyfall* earned $1.109 billion worldwide,[4] and at the time of its release was the highest-grossing film worldwide for Sony Pictures and the second-highest-grossing film of 2012.[117][118] On its opening weekend, it earned $80.6 million from 25 markets.[119] In the UK the film grossed £20.1 million on its opening weekend, making it the second-highest Friday-to-Sunday debut ever behind *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2*.[120] It also achieved the second-highest IMAX debut ever behind *The Dark Knight Rises*.[119] The film set a record for the highest seven-day gross with £37.2 million, surpassing previous record holder *Deathly Hallows – Part 2* (£35.7 million).[121] By 9 November 2012 the film had earned over £57 million to surpass *The Dark Knight Rises* as the highest-grossing film of 2012, and the highest-grossing James Bond film of all time in the UK.[122] After 40 days of release the total UK gross stood at £94.28 million, making *Skyfall* the highest-grossing film in the UK, surpassing the £94.03 million of *Avatar*.[123] By 30 December 2012, it had become the first film to gross more than £100 million ($161.6 million) in the UK. That same day, the film also crossed the $1 billion milestone worldwide, making it only the fourteenth film and first Bond film to do so.[124] It was also the seventh-highest-grossing film ever made at the time, pushing it past the inflation-adjusted amount of $1.047 billion earned by *Thunderball*.[125][126]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nDaniel Craig, Javier Bardem and Bérénice Marlohe in Paris at the film's French premiere, October 2012\n\n*Skyfall* set an opening weekend record in Switzerland ($5.3 million) and recorded the second-largest opening weekend of the year for a Hollywood film in India after *The Amazing Spider-Man* ($5.1 million), as well as grossing $14.3 million on its opening weekend in France.[127] In Austria, it achieved the second-highest opening weekend ever ($3.4 million) behind *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, while in Finland, it scored the largest opening weekend when excluding previews ($1.47 million).[128]\n\n\nIn North America, the film opened in 3,505 cinemas, the widest opening for a Bond film.[129] The film earned $2.4 million from midnight showings on its opening day and a further $2.2 million from IMAX and large-format cinemas.[129] *Skyfall* went on to gross $30.8 million on its opening day in the US and Canada,[130] and $88.4 million in its opening weekend, the biggest debut yet for a Bond film.[131] By the end of its theatrical run, the film earned $304.4 million in the United States and Canada, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2012 in these regions.[4][132]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Skyfall* received \"generally positive reviews from critics and fans\", according to the *GlobalPost*.[133] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 92% based on 384 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Sam Mendes brings Bond surging back with a smart, sexy, riveting action thriller that qualifies as one of the best 007 films to date.\"[134] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 81 out of 100 based on 49 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[135] CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade filmgoers gave the film was an \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[136]\n\n\nA number of critics, including Kate Muir, reviewing for *The Times*, Philip French, writing in *The Observer*, IGN's Daniel Krupa and the reviewers for the *Irish Independent* and the *Daily Record*, all asked whether *Skyfall* was the best Bond film.[137] *The Daily Telegraph*'s film reviewer, Robbie Collin, considered *Skyfall* to be \"often dazzling, always audacious\",[31] with excellent action sequences in a film that contained humour and emotion.[31] Todd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter* thought that *Skyfall* was \"dramatically gripping while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor\",[138] going on to say that it was a film that had \"some weight and complexity to it\".[138] *Variety*'s Peter DeBruge suggested that the film's greatest strength lay in its willingness to put as much focus on characterisation as it did action set-pieces, allowing the two to co-exist rather than compete for the audience's attention,[139] while Manohla Dargis, reviewing for *The New York Times*, considered *Skyfall* to be \"a superior follow-up to *Casino Royale*\"[140] which is \"opulent rather than outlandish and insistently, progressively low-key\".[140]\n\n\nKim Newman, reviewing the film for *Empire*, concluded, \"*Skyfall* is pretty much all you could want from a 21st Century Bond: cool but not camp, respectful of tradition but up to the moment, serious in its thrills and relatively complex in its characters but with the sense of fun that hasn't always been evident lately\".[141] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, describing it as \"a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon\".[142] Reviewing for the *New Statesman*, Ryan Gilbey saw that \"nostalgia permeates the movie\",[143] going on to say that \"sometimes the old ways are the best\".[143]\n\n\nA number of reviewers praised Daniel Craig's lead performance. Roger Ebert believed that in *Skyfall*, \"Daniel Craig [takes] full possession of a role he earlier played well in 'Casino Royale,' not so well in 'Quantum'\";[142] Philip French commented that \"Craig manages to get out of the shadow of [Sean] Connery\";[144] while Daniel Krupa thought Craig's Bond was a \"defining performance\" for \"a great actor\".[145] Edward Porter, writing in *The Sunday Times*, considered that \"Craig has developed an authoritative Bond persona, dry and intelligent\".[146] Ryan Gilbey thought Craig had \"relaxed into Bond without losing any steeliness\".[143]\n\n\nThe supporting cast also received praise. Roger Ebert reflected that *Skyfall* \"at last provides a role worthy of Judi Dench, one of the best actors of her generation. She is all but the co-star of the film, with a lot of screen time, poignant dialogue, and a character who is far more complex and sympathetic than we expect in this series\".[142] Jenny McCartney, writing in *The Sunday Telegraph*, agreed, describing Dench as \"compellingly luminous\" in the film, and the one that \"the camera caresses most meaningfully and often\".[147] McCartney thought Javier Bardem played Silva \"with worrisome élan\",[147] while Henry K Miller considered his character \"the most authentically Bondian Bond villain in decades\".[148] A number of critics noted the strength of the supporting cast; Kim Newman found the \"warmth and gravitas\" of Finney's performance noteworthy,[141] while other reviewers, including Edward Porter, Daniel Krupa and *The Playlist*'s Oliver Lyttelton, singled out Ralph Fiennes as Mallory and Ben Whishaw as Q.[149]\n\n\nAnn Hornaday, writing for *The Washington Post*, thought Sam Mendes had reinvigorated the series, with *Skyfall* being \"sleek, crisp, classy ... exhibiting just the right proportion of respect for legacy and embrace of novelty\".[150] Henry K. Miller of *Sight & Sound* agreed, and praised Mendes, who he thought was worthy of directing more Bond films.[148] Kim Newman also praised Mendes's direction of the action sequences.[141] The work of cinematographer Roger Deakins also received praise: Newman commented that he \"delivers the most impressive visuals this series has had since the 1960s\",[141] and Miller described the film as \"dazzlingly photographed\".[148]\n\n\nThe film did not escape criticism, with reviews pointing to its two and a half-hour running time, and the final third of the film being \"protracted\", and not matching the first two thirds in its momentum as the underlying flaws in the film.[151][152] Xan Brooks of *The Guardian*, in an otherwise positive review, criticised the \"touchy-feely indulgence\" of \"the bold decision to open Bond up – to probe at the character's back-story and raise a toast to his relationship with M\".[153] Daniel Krupa also singled out Naomie Harris as \"awkward\" and having \"virtually non-existent chemistry\" with Craig.[145] Similarly Philip French in *The Observer* tempered his praise for the film by highlighting \"some lazy repetition\" and argued, \"the badinage is often perfunctory and Bond is as usual captured too easily and too easily escapes\".[144] Edward Porter, writing in *The Sunday Times*, considered that while aspects of the film were \"achieved with wit and panache\",[146] he found that the climax to the film was slightly disappointing, although the \"weaknesses in the final stages are not serious, however, and the film's brief epilogue is wonderful\".[146]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The UK DVD release of *Skyfall* was advertised by a train covered in 007 vinyls.[154]\n*Skyfall* was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital HD in the US and Canada on 12 February 2013,[155] and in the UK on 18 February 2013.[156]\n\n\nIt was later released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on 22 October 2019 along with the other three Daniel Craig Bond movies in a 4K boxset, with this release itself being released standalone 25 February 2020 by 20th Century Studios Home Entertainment.\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Skyfall*\n\nAt the 85th Academy Awards, *Skyfall* received nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Sound Mixing; and won Best Original Song (the first Bond theme to be so honoured) and Best Sound Editing.[157] The film's other nominations include eight British Academy Film Awards (winning two),[158] seven Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning three),[159][160] and a Golden Globe Award (which it won).[161][162]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* *Happy and Glorious*, a short film starring Daniel Craig as James Bond produced for the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n* List of films featuring home invasions\n* Outline of James Bond\n\n\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The other three were \"For Your Eyes Only\" (1981), \"Nobody Does It Better\" (1977), and \"Live and Let Die\" (1973).[107][108]\n\n### References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Skyfall\". *AFI Catalog*.

The film is the third to star Daniel Craig as fictional MI6 agent James Bond and features Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva, the villain, with Judi Dench returning as M. Directed by Sam Mendes and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan, the film has Bond investigating a series of targeted data leaks and co-ordinated attacks on MI6 led by Raoul Silva. It sees the return of two recurring characters, Miss Moneypenny (played by Naomie Harris) and Q (played by Ben Whishaw), after an absence of two films. Ralph Fiennes, Bérénice Marlohe, and Albert Finney are among the supporting cast.\n\n\nMendes was approached to direct after the release of *Quantum of Solace* in 2008. Development of the film was suspended throughout 2010 after Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which caused screenwriter Peter Morgan to leave the project. Production resumed in December 2010 after Purvis, Wade, and Logan were hired and a November 2012 release date was announced in January 2011.[5] Principal photography began that November after the film's title was revealed and lasted until March 2012, with filming locations including London, Shanghai, Istanbul, and Scotland.\n\n\n*Skyfall* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall on 23 October 2012, and was released theatrically in conventional and IMAX formats in the United Kingdom three days later and in the United States on 9 November, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the first *James Bond* film *Dr. No* (1962). *Skyfall* received praise for Mendes's direction, cast performances, action sequences, cinematography, and musical score. The film was nominated for five awards at the 85th Academy Awards, winning two, and received numerous other accolades. *Skyfall* grossed $1 billion worldwide, the fourteenth film to do so, and became the then-seventh-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing *James Bond* film, the second-highest-grossing film of 2012, and the then-highest-grossing film released by Sony or MGM. The next film in the series, *Spectre*, was released in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn Istanbul, MI6 agents James Bond and Eve Moneypenny pursue mercenary Patrice, who has stolen a hard drive containing details of undercover agents. As Bond and Patrice fight atop a moving train, M orders Moneypenny to shoot Patrice, despite not having a clear shot; Moneypenny inadvertently hits Bond, who falls into a river. Bond is presumed dead and Patrice escapes with the hard drive.\n\n\nThree months later, due to a public inquiry into M's handling of the stolen hard drive, she is pressured to retire by Gareth Mallory, the chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament and a former SAS officer. Although she claims she is still useful, MI6's servers are hacked, and M receives a taunting computer message moments before the MI6 building explodes. Bond, who used his presumed death to retire, learns of the attack and returns to service in London. He fails a series of physical, medical, and psychological examinations, but M approves his return to the field, ordering him to identify Patrice's employer, recover the hard drive, and kill Patrice. He meets Q, MI6's new quartermaster, who gives him a radio beacon and a Walther PPK pistol.\n\n\nIn Shanghai, Bond follows Patrice and witnesses him killing a target. The two fight and Patrice falls to his death before Bond can learn his employer's identity. Moneypenny joins Bond in his investigation on orders from Mallory. Bond finds a casino token Patrice intended to cash in for the assassination, leading him to a casino in Macau. There, Bond is approached by Sévérine, Patrice's accomplice. Recognising her tattoo, he concludes she was a sex slave \"rescued\" by a criminal who now employs her, a man Bond wishes to meet. She warns him he is targeted by her bodyguards, but promises to help if Bond kills her employer. Bond fends off the attackers, and joins Sévérine on her yacht, the *Chimera*. They travel to an abandoned island off the coast of Macau, where the crew captures and delivers them to Sévérine's employer, Raoul Silva. Once an MI6 agent, Silva turned to cyberterrorism and orchestrated the attack on MI6. Silva kills Sévérine, but Bond alerts MI6 reinforcements who capture Silva for rendition to Britain.\n\n\nAt MI6's new underground headquarters, Q attempts to decrypt Silva's laptop, but inadvertently gives it access to the MI6 servers, allowing Silva to escape. Q concludes Silva wanted to be captured as part of a plan to kill M, whom he hates for disavowing and betraying him to the Chinese government during the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, leaving him to be tortured and disfigured by a suicide attempt by cyanide pill. Silva escapes his cell and Bond chases him through the London Underground and thwarts Silva's attack at a Parliament inquiry where M is present.\n\n\nInstructing Q and Bill Tanner to leave an electronic trail for Silva to follow, Bond uses his Aston Martin DB5 to take M to Skyfall, his childhood home in the Scottish Highlands. They meet Skyfall's gamekeeper Kincade, and together the trio set up a series of booby traps throughout the house. When Silva's men arrive, Bond, M, and Kincade kill most of them, but M is wounded. Silva arrives by helicopter with more men and heavy weapons, so Bond sends M and Kincade through a priest hole to hide in a nearby chapel, and rigs propane tanks to explode. As the house and the helicopter are destroyed, Bond escapes down the same tunnel.\n\n\nSilva survives the destruction of the house, following Kincade and M to the chapel. Confronting M, Silva forces his gun into her hand and presses his temple to hers, begging her to kill them both. Bond arrives and kills Silva by throwing a knife into his back. M then succumbs to her wounds and dies in Bond's arms.\n\n\nFollowing M's funeral, Moneypenny formally introduces herself to Bond and tells him she is retiring from fieldwork to become secretary for Mallory, the newly appointed M. Bond meets with Mallory, and tells him he is ready to get back to work.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Daniel Craig as James Bond, agent 007\n* Judi Dench as M, the head of MI6 and Bond's superior\n* Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva (born Tiago Rodriguez),[6] a cyberterrorist\n* Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory, chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee and a former SAS Lieutenant Colonel\n* Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny, an MI6 field agent\n* Bérénice Marlohe as Sévérine, Raoul Silva's associate and mistress\n* Albert Finney as Kincade, the gamekeeper of the Skyfall estate\n* Ben Whishaw as Q, the MI6 quartermaster\n* Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner, M's chief of staff[7]\n* Ola Rapace as Patrice, a mercenary under Silva's command\n* Helen McCrory as Clair Dowar MP\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nDevelopment of *Bond 23* began in 2009 but was suspended throughout 2010 because of MGM's financial troubles.[8] Preproduction resumed following MGM's exit from bankruptcy on 21 December 2010, and in January 2011, the film was officially given a release date of 9 November 2012 by MGM and the Broccoli family, with production scheduled to start in late 2011. Subsequently, MGM and Sony Pictures announced that the UK release date would be brought forward to 26 October 2012, two weeks ahead of the US release date, which remained scheduled for 9 November 2012.[9] The film's budget is estimated to have been between US$150 million[10][11] and $200 million,[4] compared to the $200 million spent on *Quantum of Solace*.[12] *Skyfall* was part of year-long celebrations of the 50th anniversary of *Dr. No* and the Bond film series.\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nAfter the release of *Quantum of Solace* in 2008, producer Barbara Broccoli commented that *Skyfall*, untitled at the time, may continue the plot of the Quantum organisation, introduced in *Casino Royale* and continued in *Quantum of Solace*.[13]\n\n\nIn August 2011, the Serbian newspaper *Blic* stated that *Bond 23* would be titled *Carte Blanche* and would be an adaptation of the recent continuation novel by Jeffery Deaver.[14] On 30 August, Eon Productions officially denied any link between *Bond 23* and *Carte Blanche*, stating that \"the new film is not going to be called *Carte Blanche* and will have nothing to do with the Jeffery Deaver book\".[15] On 3 October 2011, fifteen domain names including *jamesbond-skyfall.com* and *skyfallthefilm.com* were reported to have been registered on behalf of MGM and Sony Pictures by Internet brand-protection service MarkMonitor. *Skyfall* was confirmed as the title at a press conference on 3 November 2011, during which co-producer Barbara Broccoli said that the title \"has some emotional context which will be revealed in the film\".[16] The title refers to the name of Bond's childhood home, \"Skyfall\", and the setting for the film's finale.[17]\n\n\n\n#### Casting[edit]\n\n\nThe main cast was announced at a press conference held at the Corinthia Hotel in London on 3 November 2011,[18] fifty years after Sean Connery had been announced as James Bond in the film *Dr. No*.[19] Daniel Craig returned as James Bond for the third time,[20] saying he felt lucky to have the chance.[21] Mendes described Bond as experiencing a \"combination of lassitude, boredom, depression [and] difficulty with what he's chosen to do for a living\".[22] Judi Dench returned as M for her seventh and final time.[23] Over the course of the film, M's ability to run MI6 is called into question, culminating in a public inquiry into her running of the service.\n\n\nJavier Bardem was cast as the principal villain, Raoul Silva, a cyberterrorist seeking revenge against those he holds responsible for betraying him.[24][25] Bardem described Silva as \"more than a villain\", while Craig stated that Bond has a \"very important relationship\" to Silva.[26] Mendes admitted that he had lobbied hard for Bardem to accept the part, and saw potential for the character to be recognised as one of the most memorable in the series. He wanted to create \"something [the audience] may consider to have been absent from the Bond movies for a long time\",[27] and felt that Bardem was one of the few actors able to become \"colourless\" and exist as more than just a function of the plot.[28] In preparing for the role, Bardem had the script translated into his native Spanish, which Mendes cited as a sign of his commitment.[29] Bardem dyed his hair blond for the role, after brainstorming ideas for a distinct visual look with Mendes,[30] which led some commentators to suggest a resemblance to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.[31][32][33] Bérénice Marlohe was cast as Séverine, saved from the Macau sex trade by Silva and now working as his representative.[34][35] Marlohe described her character as being \"glamorous and enigmatic\",[20] and that she drew inspiration from *GoldenEye* villain Xenia Onatopp (played by Famke Janssen).[36]\n\n\nRalph Fiennes was cast as Gareth Mallory,[37] a former lieutenant colonel in the British Army and now Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee,[38] which regulates MI6.[39] At the end of the film, Mallory becomes the head of MI6, assuming the title of 'M'. During production, Fiennes stated that he could not say anything specific about the role other than that it was a \"really interesting part which is really quite fun\".[40] Fiennes had previously been considered to play Bond during the casting of *GoldenEye*.[41][42] Naomie Harris was cast as the returning character of Miss Moneypenny.[33] Harris's role was initially presented as that of Eve, an MI6 field agent who works closely with Bond. Despite media speculation that Harris had been cast as Miss Moneypenny,[43][44] this was not confirmed by anyone involved in production, with Harris herself dismissing claims that Eve was in fact Moneypenny.[45] According to Harris, Eve \"[believes] she is Bond's equal, but she is really his junior\".[46] Another returning character was Q, played by Ben Whishaw.[47] Mendes had initially declined to confirm which part Whishaw would play,[20] and later said the idea of the re-introduction was his, saying, \"I offered ideas about Moneypenny, Q and a flamboyant villain and they said yes\". To play the part of Kincade, Mendes cast Albert Finney.[48] The producers briefly considered approaching Sean Connery to play the role in a nod to the 50th anniversary of the series, but decided not to as they felt Connery's presence would have been seen as stunt casting and might disengage the audience.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Crew[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director Sam Mendes at the film's premiere in Paris, October 2012\nMendes first signed on to direct the project shortly after *Quantum of Solace* was released, and remained as a consultant during the uncertainty surrounding MGM's financial situation. Mendes, who had previously worked with Craig on *Road to Perdition*, was approached after seeing Craig in *A Steady Rain*, meeting after a performance, where Craig broached the subject of directing a *Bond* film for the first time.[50] He was at first hesitant, as the job had little appeal to him, but he did not reject the offer immediately because of Craig's involvement and enthusiasm; Mendes described Craig's casting and performance in *Casino Royale* as being what he felt the *Bond* franchise needed. He agreed to direct after meeting producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and seeing the early direction the film was going to take.[50] Media speculation was that Mendes had commissioned rewrites of the script to \"[remove] action scenes in favour of 'characterful performances'\" with the hope of securing an Academy Award.[51] Mendes denied this, saying that the action scenes were an important part of the film.[19]\n\n\nRoger Deakins signed on as cinematographer, having previously worked with Mendes on *Jarhead* and *Revolutionary Road*.[52] Dennis Gassner returned as production designer, the costume designer was Jany Temime, Alexander Witt was director of the second unit, the stunt co-ordinator was Gary Powell and Chris Corbould supervised the special effects, while the visual effects supervisor was Steve Begg. All had worked on previous *Bond* films.[5] Daniel Kleinman returned to design the title sequence after stepping aside to allow graphic design studio MK12 to create the *Quantum of Solace* sequence.[53]\n\n\n\n#### Writing[edit]\n\n\nPeter Morgan was originally commissioned to write a script, but left the project when MGM filed for bankruptcy and production of the film stalled; despite his departure, Morgan later stated that the final script was based on his original idea, retaining what he described as its \"big hook\".[54] Mendes denied this as \"just not true\", insisting that Morgan's approach had been discarded once he had agreed to direct.[55] Robert Wade later said that \"Neal and I were pretty steeped in Fleming. I think Peter was more interested in Le Carré. It just didn't work.\"[56] Morgan cowrote the treatment *Once Upon a Spy* with Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, which had M being blackmailed by a Russian oligarch, who would be a former KGB agent she had an affair with while stationed in West Berlin during the Cold War. The script would have ended with Bond being forced to kill M.[57][58][42] Mendes disliked most of the script but asked to keep the ending with M's death.[57]\n\n\nPurvis and Wade then wrote a new script drawing from *You Only Live Twice* (1964) and *The Man with the Golden Gun* (1965), in which Bond is presumed dead after an accident and travels back to London to an uncertain MI6. The original screenplay would have more closely followed the literary series' story arc with Bond becoming an amnesiac and unknowingly impregnating his lover Lily in Turkey, who would have tracked him down to London after he returned to MI6. It would have featured Bond tracking down a Francisco Scaramanga-esque villain into the Andes Mountains, and would have had a \"*Heart of Darkness* feel.\"[59] The screenplay was delayed because of MGM's financial problems. At the end of 2010, Purvis and Wade completed a draft titled *Nothing is Forever* in which a villain called Raoul Sousa kills M with a bombing aboard the Barcelona Metro and leaves a bureaucrat named Mallender as the new M. They still disliked the third act, and so later revised it to include the ending in Scotland.[60] The final script was rewritten by John Logan, who kept most of Purvis and Wade's basic story.[61] Logan recounted being brought into the project by his long-time friend Mendes, describing the process between Mendes and the writers as \"very collaborative\", and that writing *Skyfall* was one of the best experiences he had had in scripting.[62] British playwright Jez Butterworth also provided uncredited contributions.[63]\n\n\n\n#### Location scouting[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2011, Mendes and Broccoli travelled to South Africa for location scouting.[64] With the film moving into pre-production in August, reports emerged that shooting would take place in India,[65] with scenes to be shot in the Sarojini Nagar district of New Delhi[66] and on railway lines between Goa and Ahmedabad.[67] The production crew faced complications in securing permission to close sections of the Konkan Railway.[68] Similar problems in obtaining filming permits were encountered by production crews for *The Dark Knight Rises* and *Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol*.[69] Permission was eventually granted to the Bond production crew; the production ultimately did not shoot in India.[70]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Aston Martin DB5 featured in the film\n![](image)The MI6 Building in London\nPrincipal photography was scheduled to take up to 133 days,[71] although actually took 128.[72] It began on 7 November 2011 in London,[19][73] with Deakins using Arri Alexa digital cameras to shoot the entire film. It was the first Bond film to be shot digitally.[74] Scenes were shot in London Underground stations,[75] Smithfield car park in West Smithfield,[76] the National Gallery, Southwark,[77] Whitehall, Parliament Square,[78] Charing Cross station,[79] the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich,[80] Cadogan Square[76] and Tower Hill.[81] St Bartholomew's Hospital[77] was used for the scene in which Bond enters MI6's underground headquarters, while the Old Vic Tunnels underneath Waterloo Station served as the MI6 training grounds. The meeting between Q and Bond was filmed when the National Gallery was closed at night.\n\n\nThe Department of Energy and Climate Change offices were used for the scene near the end, when Bond stands on the roof.[76][82] Vauxhall Bridge and Millbank were closed to traffic for filming the explosion at the MI6 headquarters at Vauxhall Cross.[82] Unlike for *The World Is Not Enough*, which featured an explosion at the building filmed at a large-scale replica, this explosion was added digitally during post-production.[83] The finale was planned for Duntrune Castle in Argyll,[84] but shortly after filming began[85] the location was changed to Glencoe.[82] Although supposedly in Scotland, Bond's family home was constructed on Hankley Common in Surrey[86] using a plywood and plaster full-scale model of the building.[87]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Varda Viaduct was used for the scene in which Bond is shot.\nProduction moved to Turkey in March 2012, with filming continuing until 6 May.[88][89] Adana stands in for the outskirts of Istanbul.[90] Some Turkish teenagers infiltrated a closed set in railway sidings in Adana, during film rehearsals of the fight on top of a train, before they were caught by security.[91] The train scene depicted in trailers showed the Varda Viaduct outside Adana, during which Bond stunt double Andy Lister dived backwards off the 300-foot (91 m) drop, with a crane on a train carriage holding a safety line.[82] Parts of Istanbul—including the Spice Bazaar, Yeni Camii, the Grand Post Office, Sultanahmet Square and the Grand Bazaar—were closed for filming in April.[88] Affected store owners were reportedly allowed to open their shops, but not allowed to conduct business, instead being paid TRY₺750 ($418) per day as compensation.[88] Production was criticised for allegedly damaging buildings while filming a motorcycle chase across rooftops. Wilson denied this, pointing out that the crew had removed sections of rooftop before filming, and replaced them with temporary replicas.[92] The production team negotiated with 613 part-owners of Calis Beach in Fethiye to film along the coastline.[82]\n\n\nMendes confirmed that China would feature in the film, with shooting scheduled for Shanghai and \"other parts\" of the country.[19] Logan asserted that they deliberately sought locations that were \"in opposition\" to London, with an exotic quality as \"places for Bond to be uncomfortable\".[82] Scenes with the principal actors were not filmed on location in Shanghai, but in the UK. The Virgin Active pool in London's Canary Wharf acted as Bond's hotel pool,[77][82] Ascot Racecourse stood in for Shanghai Pudong International Airport,[93][94] and London's Broadgate Tower was used as the entrance and lobby of the Shanghai office building. The Golden Dragon casino in Macau was constructed on a sound stage at Pinewood Studios, with 300 floating lanterns and two 30-foot-high dragon heads lighting the set.[82] The production received permission to shoot second unit aerial footage of Shanghai from a helicopter loaned by the Chinese government.[82] The first official image from the film was released on 1 February 2012, showing Craig on set at Pinewood within a recreation of a Shanghai skyscraper.[95]\n\n\nThe lair of villain Silva was inspired by Hashima, an abandoned island off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan.[96][97] In the film, the fictionalized island is located near Macau. Mendes explained that the sequence was created with a combination of large sets of the city streets and computer-generated establishing shots.[98] The Hashima setting was included after Craig met with Swedish film-maker Thomas Nordanstad while shooting *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo* in Stockholm. Nordanstad, who produced a short 2002 documentary on the island entitled *Hashima*, recalled Craig taking extensive notes during the meeting, but was unaware of his interest in it until *Skyfall* was released.[99]\n\n\nThe film was later converted into the IMAX format for projection in IMAX cinemas. Deakins was unaware that the film was to be released on IMAX until after he had made the decision to shoot the film with the Arri Alexa cameras, and was unhappy with the IMAX tests made from his footage as the colours \"didn't look great\".[74] After exploring the IMAX system further and discovering that the IMAX Corporation was using their proprietary re-mastering process, Deakins had further tests made without the process and found that \"the images looked spectacular on the big IMAX screen\", quelling his doubts about the format.[74]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas Newman composed the film's score.\nMain article: Skyfall (soundtrack)\n\nThomas Newman, who had previously worked with Mendes as composer for *American Beauty*, *Road to Perdition*, *Jarhead* and *Revolutionary Road*, replaced David Arnold as composer,[100] becoming the ninth composer in the series' history. When asked about the circumstances surrounding his departure from the role, David Arnold commented that Newman had been selected by Mendes because of their work together, rather than because of Arnold's commitment to working with director Danny Boyle as composer for the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics.[101][*non-primary source needed*] The soundtrack album was released on 29 October 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 6 November 2012 in the United States.[102]\n\n\nIn October 2012 British singer-songwriter Adele confirmed that she had written and recorded the film's theme song with her regular songwriter, Paul Epworth.[103][104] She later posted the cover for the \"Skyfall\" sheet music on Twitter, crediting the songwriting to herself and Epworth, with arrangements to both Epworth and orchestrator J. A. C. Redford.[105][*non-primary source needed*] The song was released online at 0:07 am BST on 5 October 2012, a day dubbed \"James Bond Day\" by the producers as it marked 50 years to the day of the release of *Dr. No*.[106]\n\n\nThe song was nominated for and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. It was the first time a Bond song had won, and the fourth time one had been nominated.[107][108][a] \"Skyfall\" also won the Brit Award for Best British Single at the 2013 BRIT Awards.[109]\n\n\nThe film also features Charles Trenet's 1938 song \"Boum !\" during scenes in which Silva shows Bond around his abandoned island, and The Animals' 1964 cover of John Lee Hooker's song, \"Boom Boom\" when Silva assaults Skyfall in the film's finale.[110]\n\n\n\n## Release and reception[edit]\n\n\nThe premiere of *Skyfall* was on 23 October 2012 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The event was attended by Charles, Prince of Wales, and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.[111] Charles asked that money raised at the premiere be donated to charities that served former or serving members of the British intelligence agencies.[112] The film was released in the UK three days later on 26 October and into US cinemas on 8 November.[113] *Skyfall* was the first Bond film to be screened in IMAX venues[114] and was released into IMAX cinemas in North America a day earlier than the conventional cinema release.[115]\n\n\n*Skyfall* attracted some criticism from the US Sexual Violence Resource Center which, without having screened the film, expressed concern that Bond \"abuses his power and authority\" in a scene that suggests Bond initiates sexual intercourse with Sévérine, a former victim of sex trafficking.[116]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Skyfall* earned $1.109 billion worldwide,[4] and at the time of its release was the highest-grossing film worldwide for Sony Pictures and the second-highest-grossing film of 2012.[117][118] On its opening weekend, it earned $80.6 million from 25 markets.[119] In the UK the film grossed £20.1 million on its opening weekend, making it the second-highest Friday-to-Sunday debut ever behind *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2*.[120] It also achieved the second-highest IMAX debut ever behind *The Dark Knight Rises*.[119] The film set a record for the highest seven-day gross with £37.2 million, surpassing previous record holder *Deathly Hallows – Part 2* (£35.7 million).[121] By 9 November 2012 the film had earned over £57 million to surpass *The Dark Knight Rises* as the highest-grossing film of 2012, and the highest-grossing James Bond film of all time in the UK.[122] After 40 days of release the total UK gross stood at £94.28 million, making *Skyfall* the highest-grossing film in the UK, surpassing the £94.03 million of *Avatar*.[123] By 30 December 2012, it had become the first film to gross more than £100 million ($161.6 million) in the UK. That same day, the film also crossed the $1 billion milestone worldwide, making it only the fourteenth film and first Bond film to do so.[124] It was also the seventh-highest-grossing film ever made at the time, pushing it past the inflation-adjusted amount of $1.047 billion earned by *Thunderball*.[125][126]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nDaniel Craig, Javier Bardem and Bérénice Marlohe in Paris at the film's French premiere, October 2012\n\n*Skyfall* set an opening weekend record in Switzerland ($5.3 million) and recorded the second-largest opening weekend of the year for a Hollywood film in India after *The Amazing Spider-Man* ($5.1 million), as well as grossing $14.3 million on its opening weekend in France.[127] In Austria, it achieved the second-highest opening weekend ever ($3.4 million) behind *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, while in Finland, it scored the largest opening weekend when excluding previews ($1.47 million).[128]\n\n\nIn North America, the film opened in 3,505 cinemas, the widest opening for a Bond film.[129] The film earned $2.4 million from midnight showings on its opening day and a further $2.2 million from IMAX and large-format cinemas.[129] *Skyfall* went on to gross $30.8 million on its opening day in the US and Canada,[130] and $88.4 million in its opening weekend, the biggest debut yet for a Bond film.[131] By the end of its theatrical run, the film earned $304.4 million in the United States and Canada, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2012 in these regions.[4][132]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Skyfall* received \"generally positive reviews from critics and fans\", according to the *GlobalPost*.[133] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 92% based on 384 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Sam Mendes brings Bond surging back with a smart, sexy, riveting action thriller that qualifies as one of the best 007 films to date.\"[134] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 81 out of 100 based on 49 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[135] CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade filmgoers gave the film was an \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[136]\n\n\nA number of critics, including Kate Muir, reviewing for *The Times*, Philip French, writing in *The Observer*, IGN's Daniel Krupa and the reviewers for the *Irish Independent* and the *Daily Record*, all asked whether *Skyfall* was the best Bond film.[137] *The Daily Telegraph*'s film reviewer, Robbie Collin, considered *Skyfall* to be \"often dazzling, always audacious\",[31] with excellent action sequences in a film that contained humour and emotion.[31] Todd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter* thought that *Skyfall* was \"dramatically gripping while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor\",[138] going on to say that it was a film that had \"some weight and complexity to it\".[138] *Variety*'s Peter DeBruge suggested that the film's greatest strength lay in its willingness to put as much focus on characterisation as it did action set-pieces, allowing the two to co-exist rather than compete for the audience's attention,[139] while Manohla Dargis, reviewing for *The New York Times*, considered *Skyfall* to be \"a superior follow-up to *Casino Royale*\"[140] which is \"opulent rather than outlandish and insistently, progressively low-key\".[140]\n\n\nKim Newman, reviewing the film for *Empire*, concluded, \"*Skyfall* is pretty much all you could want from a 21st Century Bond: cool but not camp, respectful of tradition but up to the moment, serious in its thrills and relatively complex in its characters but with the sense of fun that hasn't always been evident lately\".[141] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, describing it as \"a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon\".[142] Reviewing for the *New Statesman*, Ryan Gilbey saw that \"nostalgia permeates the movie\",[143] going on to say that \"sometimes the old ways are the best\".[143]\n\n\nA number of reviewers praised Daniel Craig's lead performance. Roger Ebert believed that in *Skyfall*, \"Daniel Craig [takes] full possession of a role he earlier played well in 'Casino Royale,' not so well in 'Quantum'\";[142] Philip French commented that \"Craig manages to get out of the shadow of [Sean] Connery\";[144] while Daniel Krupa thought Craig's Bond was a \"defining performance\" for \"a great actor\".[145] Edward Porter, writing in *The Sunday Times*, considered that \"Craig has developed an authoritative Bond persona, dry and intelligent\".[146] Ryan Gilbey thought Craig had \"relaxed into Bond without losing any steeliness\".[143]\n\n\nThe supporting cast also received praise. Roger Ebert reflected that *Skyfall* \"at last provides a role worthy of Judi Dench, one of the best actors of her generation. She is all but the co-star of the film, with a lot of screen time, poignant dialogue, and a character who is far more complex and sympathetic than we expect in this series\".[142] Jenny McCartney, writing in *The Sunday Telegraph*, agreed, describing Dench as \"compellingly luminous\" in the film, and the one that \"the camera caresses most meaningfully and often\".[147] McCartney thought Javier Bardem played Silva \"with worrisome élan\",[147] while Henry K Miller considered his character \"the most authentically Bondian Bond villain in decades\".[148] A number of critics noted the strength of the supporting cast; Kim Newman found the \"warmth and gravitas\" of Finney's performance noteworthy,[141] while other reviewers, including Edward Porter, Daniel Krupa and *The Playlist*'s Oliver Lyttelton, singled out Ralph Fiennes as Mallory and Ben Whishaw as Q.[149]\n\n\nAnn Hornaday, writing for *The Washington Post*, thought Sam Mendes had reinvigorated the series, with *Skyfall* being \"sleek, crisp, classy ... exhibiting just the right proportion of respect for legacy and embrace of novelty\".[150] Henry K. Miller of *Sight & Sound* agreed, and praised Mendes, who he thought was worthy of directing more Bond films.[148] Kim Newman also praised Mendes's direction of the action sequences.[141] The work of cinematographer Roger Deakins also received praise: Newman commented that he \"delivers the most impressive visuals this series has had since the 1960s\",[141] and Miller described the film as \"dazzlingly photographed\".[148]\n\n\nThe film did not escape criticism, with reviews pointing to its two and a half-hour running time, and the final third of the film being \"protracted\", and not matching the first two thirds in its momentum as the underlying flaws in the film.[151][152] Xan Brooks of *The Guardian*, in an otherwise positive review, criticised the \"touchy-feely indulgence\" of \"the bold decision to open Bond up – to probe at the character's back-story and raise a toast to his relationship with M\".[153] Daniel Krupa also singled out Naomie Harris as \"awkward\" and having \"virtually non-existent chemistry\" with Craig.[145] Similarly Philip French in *The Observer* tempered his praise for the film by highlighting \"some lazy repetition\" and argued, \"the badinage is often perfunctory and Bond is as usual captured too easily and too easily escapes\".[144] Edward Porter, writing in *The Sunday Times*, considered that while aspects of the film were \"achieved with wit and panache\",[146] he found that the climax to the film was slightly disappointing, although the \"weaknesses in the final stages are not serious, however, and the film's brief epilogue is wonderful\".[146]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The UK DVD release of *Skyfall* was advertised by a train covered in 007 vinyls.[154]\n*Skyfall* was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital HD in the US and Canada on 12 February 2013,[155] and in the UK on 18 February 2013.[156]\n\n\nIt was later released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on 22 October 2019 along with the other three Daniel Craig Bond movies in a 4K boxset, with this release itself being released standalone 25 February 2020 by 20th Century Studios Home Entertainment.\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Skyfall*\n\nAt the 85th Academy Awards, *Skyfall* received nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Sound Mixing; and won Best Original Song (the first Bond theme to be so honoured) and Best Sound Editing.[157] The film's other nominations include eight British Academy Film Awards (winning two),[158] seven Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning three),[159][160] and a Golden Globe Award (which it won).[161][162]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* *Happy and Glorious*, a short film starring Daniel Craig as James Bond produced for the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n* List of films featuring home invasions\n* Outline of James Bond\n\n\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The other three were \"For Your Eyes Only\" (1981), \"Nobody Does It Better\" (1977), and \"Live and Let Die\" (1973).[107][108]\n\n### References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Skyfall\". *AFI Catalog*.

It is the sequel to *Casino Royale* (2006). Directed by Marc Forster and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis, it stars Daniel Craig as Bond, alongside Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, Giancarlo Giannini, Jeffrey Wright, and Judi Dench. In the film, Bond teams with Camille Montes (Kurylenko) to stop Dominic Greene (Amalric) from staging a *coup d'état* in Bolivia to access the country's natural reserves.\n\n\nA second Bond film starring Craig was planned before production began on *Casino Royale* in October 2005. In July 2006, Roger Michell was announced to direct with a planned release for May 2008, but he left the project that October after there were delays with the screenplay. Purvis, Wade, and Haggis completed the screenplay by June 2007, after which, Forster was announced as Michell's replacement. Craig and Forster also contributed uncredited rewrites to the film's screenplay. Principal photography began in August 2007 and lasted until May 2008, with filming locations including Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria, and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at Pinewood Studios. The film's title is borrowed from a 1959 short story by Ian Fleming. In contrast to its predecessor, *Quantum of Solace* is notable for citing inspiration from early Bond film sets designed by Ken Adam, while it features a departure from tropes associated with Bond villains.\n\n\n*Quantum of Solace* premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 29 October 2008, and was theatrically released first in the United Kingdom two days later and in the United States on 14 November. The film received generally mixed reviews, with praise for Craig's performance and the action sequences but was deemed inferior to its predecessor. It grossed $589 million worldwide, becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of 2008 and the fourth-highest-grossing *James Bond* film, unadjusted for inflation. The next film in the series, *Skyfall*, was released in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nImmediately following the events of *Casino Royale*, James Bond is driving from Lake Garda to Siena, Italy, with the captured Mr. White in the trunk of his Aston Martin DBS V12. After evading pursuers, Bond delivers White to M, who interrogates White regarding the mysterious organisation Quantum. When White responds that their operatives are everywhere, M's bodyguard Craig Mitchell suddenly shoots one of the guards and attacks M. Bond chases Mitchell and eventually kills him; in the confusion, White escapes. Searching Mitchell's flat in London, Bond and M discover Mitchell had a contact named Edmund Slate in Haiti. Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill Camille Montes at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur Dominic Greene. Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano, who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow the government and become the new president in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\n\nAfter foiling Camille's assassination attempt on Medrano by \"rescuing\" her, Bond follows Greene to a performance of *Tosca* in Bregenz, Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the CIA's South American section, Gregg Beam, along with agent Felix Leiter, strike a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil, which the CIA believes to be the reason for Greene's interest in the land. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying Quantum's executive board members, and a gunfight ensues. A Special Branch bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British PM, is thrown off a roof by Bond after refusing to answer his questions. He lands on Greene's car and is shot dead by one of his men. Assuming Bond killed the bodyguard, M orders him back to MI6 for debriefing. When he disobeys, she revokes his passports and cancels his payment cards. Bond heads to Talamone and convinces his old ally René Mathis to accompany him to Bolivia. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields, a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her, and they attend a fundraising party held by Greene. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene, and they leave. The Bolivian police pull Bond and Camille over but discover Mathis unconscious in the car's boot. One of the officers shoots Mathis before Bond kills both of them. Mathis dies in Bond's arms, urging him to forgive Vesper and himself.\n\n\nThe following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is damaged by a Bolivian fighter plane. They trick the plane into destroying itself, skydive into a sinkhole, and discover that Quantum has been secretly damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a monopoly. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in crude oil. Bond meets Leiter, who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet at a hotel, *La Perla de las Dunas*, in the Atacama Desert to finalize their agreement, and warns him to escape as the CIA's Special Activities Division arrives.\n\n\nBond and Camille infiltrate the hotel, where Greene blackmails Medrano into signing a contract that will make Medrano the leader of Bolivia in exchange for the land rights, making Greene Bolivia's sole water provider at significantly higher rates. Bond kills the police chief for betraying Mathis, and after killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the rapes and murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel (which is powered by flammable hydrogen fuel cells) destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum. Bond leaves him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil. Bond and Camille share a kiss, and she wishes him luck in conquering his demons.\n\n\nBond travels to Kazan, Russia, where he finds Vesper Lynd's former lover, Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces female agents with valuable connections and is indirectly responsible for her death. After saving Kabira's latest target, Corrine, who works in Canadian intelligence, Bond allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice in the head with some engine oil found in his stomach. Bond admits that M was right about Vesper. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Bond drops Vesper's necklace behind him as he walks away in the snow.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Daniel Craig as James Bond. Craig's physical training for his reprise of the role placed extra effort into running and boxing, to spare him the injuries he sustained on his stunts in the first film.[6] Craig felt he was fitter, being less bulky than in the first film.[7] He also practised speedboating and stunt driving. Craig felt *Casino Royale* was [physically] \"a walk in the park\" compared to *Quantum of Solace*, which required a different performance from him because *Quantum of Solace* is a revenge film, not a love story like *Casino Royale*.[7] While filming in Pinewood, he suffered a gash when kicked in his face,[8] which required eight stitches, and a fingertip was sliced off. He laughed these off, noting they did not delay filming, and joked his finger would enable him to have a criminal career (though it had grown back when he made this comment).[7] He also had minor plastic surgery on his face.[9] The actor advised Paul Haggis on the script and helped choose Marc Forster as the director.[10]\n* Olga Kurylenko as Camille Montes, a Bolivian agent with her own vendetta regarding Greene and Medrano. Forster chose her because out of the 400 women who auditioned, she seemed the least nervous.[11] When she read the script, she was glad she had no love scene with Craig; she felt it would have distracted viewers from her performance.[12] Kurylenko spent three weeks training to fight with weapons, and she learnt a form of indoor skydiving known as body flying.[13] Kurylenko said she had to do \"training non-stop from the morning to the evening\" for the action scenes, overcoming her fears with the help of Craig and the stunt team.[14][15] She was given a DVD box set of Bond films, since the franchise was not easily available to watch in her native Ukraine.[13] Kurylenko found Michelle Yeoh in *Tomorrow Never Dies* inspiring \"because she did the fight scenes by herself.\"[11] The producers had intended to cast a South American actress in the role,[16] thus, Kurylenko trained with a dialect coach to perform with a Spanish accent.[15] She said that the accent was easy for her because she has \"a lot of Hispanic friends, from Latin America and Spain, and it's an accent I've always heard\".[17] When reflecting on her experience as a Bond girl, she stated she was proudest of overcoming her fears in performing stunts.[18]\n* Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene, the main villain. He is a leading member of Quantum posing as a businessman working in reforestation and charity funding for environmental science. In the 2015 Bond film *Spectre*, he is revealed to have been a member of the titular crime syndicate, of which Quantum is a subsidiary. Amalric acknowledged taking the role was an easy decision because, \"It's impossible to say to your kids that 'I could have been in a Bond film but I refused.'\"[13] Amalric wanted to wear make-up for the role, but Forster explained that he wanted Greene not to look grotesque, but to symbolise the hidden evils in society.[8] Amalric modelled his performance on \"the smile of Tony Blair [and] the craziness of Sarkozy\", the latter of whom he called \"the worst villain we [the French] have ever had … he walks around thinking he's in a Bond film.\"[19] He later claimed this was not criticism of either politician, but rather an example of how a politician relies on performance instead of a genuine policy to win power. \"Sarkozy, is just a better actor than [his presidential opponent] Ségolène Royal—that's all,\" he explained.[20] Amalric and Forster reconceived the character, who was supposed to have a \"special skill\" in the script, to someone who uses pure animal instinct when fighting Bond in the climax.[21] Bruno Ganz was also considered for the part,[16] but Forster decided Amalric gave the character a 'pitiful' quality.[21]\n* Giancarlo Giannini as René Mathis, Bond's ally who was mistakenly believed to be a traitor in *Casino Royale*. Having been acquitted, he chooses to help Bond again in his quest to find out who betrayed him.\n* Gemma Arterton as MI6 agent Strawberry Fields, who works at the British consulate in Bolivia. Fields, who is merely an office worker as described by M, takes herself seriously and tries to overpower Bond when the pair meet. She is later seduced by Bond, infiltrates Greene's fund raiser party with him and ends up paying the ultimate price. Forster found Arterton a witty actress and selected her from a reported 1,500 candidates. One of the casting directors asked her to audition for the role, having seen her portray Rosaline in *Love's Labour's Lost* at the Globe Theatre.[22] Arterton said Fields was \"not so frolicsome\" as other Bond girls, but is instead \"fresh and young, not ... a femme fatale\".[23] Arterton described Fields as a homage to the 1960s Bond girls, comparing her red wig to that of Diana Rigg, who played Tracy Bond in *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*. Rigg, alongside Honor Blackman, is one of her favourite Bond girls.[22] Arterton had to film her character's death scene first day on the set, where she was completely covered head to toe in non-toxic black paint. The character's full name, which is a reference to the Beatles song \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", is never actually uttered on screen; when she introduces herself to Bond, she says \"Mr Bond, my name is Fields, I'm from the Consulate.\". Robert A. Caplen suggests that this is a conscious effort to portray a woman 'whose character attributes are neither undermined nor compromised' by her name, even though her name may have sexual overtones reminiscent of earlier Bond girls.[24] In August 2018, Arterton wrote a short story titled Woke Woman based on the character.[25]\n* Anatole Taubman as Elvis, Greene's second-in-command. Taubman wanted to make Elvis \"as colourful, as edgy and as interesting as possible\", with one of his suggestions being the bowl cut.[26] Amalric and Taubman improvised a backstory for Elvis: he is Dominic's cousin and once lived on the streets before being inducted into Quantum. He called Elvis \"a bit of a goofball. He thinks he's all that but he's not really. … He's not a comic guy. He definitely takes himself very serious, but maybe by his taking himself too serious he may become friendly\".[27]\n* Jesper Christensen as Mr. White, whom Bond captured after he stole the money won at *Casino Royale* in Montenegro.\n* David Harbour as Gregg Beam, the CIA section chief for South America and a contact of Felix Leiter.\n* Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner, M's chief of staff.[28]\n* Tim Pigott-Smith as the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.\n* Joaquín Cosío as General Medrano, the exiled general whom Greene is helping to get back into power, in return for support of his organisation. He murdered Camille's entire family when she was a young girl.\n* Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter, Bond's ally at the CIA. Early script drafts gave Leiter a larger role, but his screentime was restricted by on-set rewrites.[29]\n* Judi Dench as M. Forster felt Dench was underused in the previous films and wanted to make her part bigger, having her interact with Bond more because she is \"the only woman Bond doesn't see in a sexual context\", which Forster finds interesting.[30]\n* Fernando Guillén Cuervo as Carlos, the Colonel of Bolivian Police, the chief of all police forces, and the contact of René Mathis in Bolivia.\n* Paul Ritter as Guy Haines, special envoy to the Prime Minister and a member of Quantum.\n* Neil Jackson as Edmund Slate, a henchman who fights Bond in Haiti.\n* Simon Kassianides as Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces female agents and manipulates them into giving away classified information. He is indirectly responsible for Vesper Lynd's death.\n* Stana Katic as Corrine Veneau, a Canadian agent and Yusef's latest target.\n* Glenn Foster as Craig Mitchell, M's bodyguard and a double agent.\n* Oona Chaplin as Perla de las Dunas's receptionist, a woman saved by Camille Montes in one of the last sequences.\n* Lucrezia Lante della Rovere as Gemma, Mathis's girlfriend.\n* Jesús Ochoa as Lieutenant Orso, a bodyguard of the exiled General Medrano\n\n\nMarc Forster asked his friends and fellow directors Guillermo del Toro and Alfonso Cuarón to appear in cameos. Cuarón appears as a Bolivian helicopter pilot, while del Toro provides several other voices.[31]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n\n> If you remember in *Chinatown*, if you control the water you control the whole development of the country. I think it's true. Right now it appears to be oil, but there's a lot of other resources that we don't think about too much but are all essential, and they're very limited and every country needs it. Because every country knows that raising the standard of living (and populations are getting bigger) is the way we're all going.\n> \n> — Michael G. Wilson on the plot.[29]\n> \n\n\nIn October 2005, before the beginning of production of *Casino Royale*, Michael G. Wilson announced that Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were working on a screenplay for the next film. They deliberately wrote *Casino Royale* to tie in to the next film so they could exploit Bond's emotions following Vesper's death in the previous film.[32] Purvis and Wade's first storyline followed Bond releasing Mr. White in Siena so that he could follow him and find his employers. Bond would later infiltrate the mysterious organisation, which is being led by the villain, Dante, who is aligned with Yusuf Kabira, Vesper's boyfriend.[33] In July 2006, as *Casino Royale* entered post-production, Eon Productions announced Roger Michell, who directed Craig in *Enduring Love* and *The Mother*, had entered negotiations to direct, and the next film would be based on an original idea by Wilson.[34] The film was confirmed for a 2 May 2008 release date, with Craig reprising the lead role.[35] Months later, in October 2006, Michell stepped down as director citing the slow progress on the script.[36] Upon Michell's departure, Sony Entertainment vice chairman Jeff Blake admitted a production schedule of 18 months was a very short window, and the release date was pushed back to late 2008.[37] Purvis and Wade completed their draft of the script by April 2007,[38] and Paul Haggis, who polished the *Casino Royale* script, began his rewrite the next month.[39] Work on script was delayed by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Haggis's draft was originally titled *Sleep of the Dead*.[40]\n\n\nFollowing Michell's departure, Tony Scott, Jonathan Mostow, Marc Forster, and Alex Proyas were under consideration to replace him.[39] In June 2007, Forster was confirmed as director.[41] He was surprised that he was approached for the job, stating he was not a big Bond film fan, and that he would not have accepted had he not seen *Casino Royale* which he felt had humanised Bond; since travelling the world had become less exotic since the series's advent, it made sense to focus more on Bond as a character. Born in Germany and raised in Switzerland, Forster was the first Bond director not to come from the British Commonwealth of Nations, although he noted that Bond's mother is Swiss, making him somewhat appropriate to handle the British icon.[42] The director collaborated strongly with Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, noting they only blocked two very expensive ideas he had.[16] The director found *Casino Royale*'s 144-minute running time too long, and wanted his follow-up to be \"tight and fast … like a bullet\".[43]\n\n\n\n\n> Because Bond plays it real, I thought the political circumstances should be real too, even though Bond shouldn't be a political film. I thought the more political I make it, the more real it feels, not just with Bolivia and what's happening in Haiti, but with all these corporations like Shell and Chevron saying they're green because it's so fashionable to be green. During the Cold War, everything was very clear, the good guys and the bad guys. Today there's much overlapping of good and bad. It isn't as morally distinct, because we all have both elements in us.\n> \n> — Marc Forster on the political landscape of the film.[44]\n> \n\n\nHaggis, Forster and Wilson rewrote the story.[45] Haggis said he completed his script two hours before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike officially began.[42] Forster noted a running theme in his films was emotionally repressed protagonists, and the theme of the picture would be Bond learning to trust after feeling betrayed by Vesper.[46] Forster said he created the Camille character as a strong female counterpart to Bond rather than a casual love interest; she openly shows emotions similar to those which Bond experiences but is unable to express.[47] Haggis located his draft's climax in the Swiss Alps,[48] but Forster wanted the action sequences to be based around the four classical elements of earth, water, air and fire.[49] The decision to homage Oddjob's murder of Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) in *Goldfinger* in Fields's death came about as Forster wanted to show oil had replaced gold as the most precious material.[44] The producers rejected Haggis's idea that Vesper Lynd had a child, because \"Bond was an orphan ... Once he finds the kid, Bond can't just leave the kid\".[50] The water supply issue in Bolivia was the main theme, with a story based on the Cochabamba Water Revolt.[51]\n\n\nWilson decided on the title *Quantum of Solace* only \"a few days\" before its announcement on 24 January 2008.[23] It was the name of a short story in Ian Fleming's anthology *For Your Eyes Only* (1960).[52] The film is related to the title in one of its thematic elements: \"when the *Quantum of Solace* drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone\". Daniel Craig admitted, \"I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in your relationship then the relationship is over. It's that spark of niceness in a relationship that if you don't have you might as well give up.\"[13] He said that \"Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend [Vesper Lynd] has been killed\",[52] and therefore, \"[Bond is] looking for revenge … to make himself happy with the world again\".[23] Afterwards, Quantum was made the name of the organisation introduced in *Casino Royale*.[53] Craig noted the letter Q itself looks rather odd.[7] Near the end of the film, the Camille Montes character and Bond have a discussion about their individual quests to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Montes asks Bond to \"let me know what it feels like\" when he succeeds, the implication of the title being that it will be a small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.\n\n\nIn a December 2011 interview, Craig stated: \"We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers' strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes—and a writer I am not\".[54] He said that he and Forster \"were the ones allowed to do it. The rules were that you couldn't employ anyone as a writer, but the actor and director could work on scenes together. We were stuffed. We got away with it, but only just. It was never meant to be as much of a sequel as it was, but it ended up being a sequel, starting where the last one finished\".[54]\n\n\nDuring filming, after the strike ended, Forster liked a spec script by Joshua Zetumer, and hired him to reshape scenes for the later parts of the shoot, with which the director was still unsatisfied.[45] Forster had the actors rehearse their scenes, as he liked to film scenes continually.[20] Zetumer rewrote dialogue depending on the actors' ideas each day.[20]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Strada delle Forre* in Tremosine (Italy) where the movie begins.\n*Quantum of Solace* was shot in six countries.[5] Second unit filming began in Italy at the Palio di Siena horse race on 16 August 2007,[55] although at that point Forster was unsure how it would fit into the film.[49] Some scenes were filmed also in Maratea and Craco, two small distinctive towns in Basilicata in southern Italy.[56] Other places used for location shooting were Madrid in August 2007;[57] Baja California, Mexico in early 2008, for shots of the aerial battle;[58][59] Malcesine, Limone sul Garda and Tremosine in Italy during March,[60] and at Talamone during the end of April.[61] The main unit began on 3 January 2008[16] at Pinewood Studios. The 007 Stage was used for the fight in the art gallery,[13] and an MI6 safehouse hidden within the city's cisterns,[62] while other stages housed Bond's Bolivian hotel suite,[63] and the MI6 headquarters.[62] Interior and exterior airport scenes were filmed at Farnborough Airfield and the snowy closing scenes were filmed at the Bruneval Barracks in Aldershot.[64]\n\n\nShooting in Panama City began on 7 February 2008 at Howard Air Force Base. The country doubled for Haiti and Bolivia, with the National Institute of Culture of Panama standing in for a hotel in the latter country. A sequence requiring several hundred extras was also shot at nearby Colón.[65] Shooting in Panama was also carried out at Fort Sherman, a former US military base on the Colón coast. Forster was disappointed he could only shoot the boat chase in that harbour, as he had a more spectacular vision for the scene.[66] Officials in the country worked with the locals to \"minimise inconvenience\" for the cast and crew, and in return hoped the city's exposure in the film would increase tourism.[67] The crew was going to move to Cusco, Peru for ten days of filming on 2 March,[65] but the location was cancelled for budget reasons.[5] Twelve days of filming in Chile began on 24 March at Antofagasta. There was shooting in Cobija, the Paranal Observatory, and other locations in the Atacama Desert.[68] Forster chose the desert and the observatory's ESO Hotel to represent Bond's rigid emotions, and being on the verge of committing a vengeful act as he confronts Greene in the film's climax.[53][69]\n\n\n\n![A scientific facility in a desert](image)Marc Forster chose the Atacama Desert to represent Bond's vengefulness in the climax.\nDuring filming in Sierra Gorda, Chile, the local mayor, Carlos Lopez, staged a protest because he was angry at the filmmakers' portrayal of the Antofagasta Region as part of Bolivia. He was arrested, detained briefly, and put on trial two days later. Eon dismissed his claim that they needed his permission to film in the area.[70][71] Michael G. Wilson explained that Bolivia was appropriate to the plot, because of the country's history of water problems,[69] and was surprised the two countries disliked each other a century after the War of the Pacific.[72] In a poll by Chilean daily newspaper *La Segunda*, 75 per cent of its readers disagreed with Lopez's actions, due to the negative image of Chile they felt it presented, and the controversy's potential to put off productions looking to film in the country in the future.[73]\n\n\nFrom 4–12 April, the main unit shot on Sienese rooftops.[61] Shooting on the real rooftops turned out to be less expensive than building them at Pinewood.[5] The next four weeks were scheduled for filming the car chase at Lake Garda and Carrara.[61] On 14 April, a closing scene featuring Jesper Christensen's Mr. White and Paul Ritter's Guy Haines getting killed by Bond after Bond said his iconic \"Bond, James Bond\" line was reportedly filmed, but the filmmakers removed it during post-production in case they decided to bring back Mr. White and/or continue the Quantum story arc in future sequels. The scene's deletion later enabled Mr. White's return in *Spectre*.[74] On 19 April, an Aston Martin employee driving a DBS to the set crashed into the lake. He survived, and was fined £400 for reckless driving.[75] Another accident occurred on 21 April, and two days later, two stuntmen were seriously injured, with one, Greek stuntman Aris Comninos, having to be put in intensive care. Filming of the scenes was temporarily halted so that Italian police could investigate the causes of the accidents.[76] Stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell said the accidents were a testament to the realism of the action.[48] Rumours of a \"curse\" spread among tabloid media, something which deeply offended Craig, who disliked that they compared Comninos's accident to something like his minor finger injury later on the shoot (also part of the \"curse\"). Comninos recovered safely from his injury.[7]\n\n\nFor the role Craig trained to be less bulky than in *Casino Royale* and told *Men's Fitness* magazine \"In fact, I was much fitter for this film compared to *Casino Royale* – I really had to be – and I was running a hell of a lot more in training, just so I could do these scenes, whereas last time I spent far more time pumping heavy weights to bulk up so I could look big.\"[77]\n\n\nFilming took place at the floating opera stage at Bregenz, Austria, from 28 April – 9 May 2008. The sequence in which Bond stalks the villains during a performance of *Tosca* required 1,500 extras.[78] The production used a large model of an eye, which Forster felt fitted in the Bond style, and the opera itself has parallels to the film.[79] A short driving sequence was filmed at the nearby Feldkirch, Vorarlberg.[80] The crew returned to Italy from 13 to 17 May to shoot a (planned) car crash at the marble quarry in Carrara,[81] and a recreation of the Palio di Siena at the Piazza del Campo in Siena. 1,000 extras were hired for a scene where Bond emerges from the *Fonte Gaia*. Originally, he would have emerged from the city's cisterns at Siena Cathedral, but this was thought disrespectful.[61] By June the crew returned to Pinewood for four weeks,[79] where new sets (including the interior of the hotel in the climax) were built.[45][63] The wrap party was held on 21 June.[82]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\nProduction designer Peter Lamont, a crew member on 18 previous Bond films, retired after *Casino Royale*.[83] Forster hired Dennis Gassner in his stead, having admired his work on *The Truman Show* and the films of the Coen brothers.[46] Craig said the film would have \"a touch of Ken Adam\",[84] while Michael G. Wilson also called Gassner's designs \"a postmodern look at modernism\".[63] Forster said he felt the early Bond films' design \"were ahead of their time\",[46] and enjoyed the clashing of an older style with his own because it created a unique look unto itself.[85] Gassner wanted his sets to emphasise Craig's \"great angular, textured face and wonderful blue eyes\", and totally redesigned the MI6 headquarters because he felt Judi Dench \"was a bit tired in the last film, so I thought, let's bring her into a new world\".[86]\n\n\nLouise Frogley replaced Lindy Hemming as costume designer, though Hemming remained as supervisor. Hemming hired Brioni for Bond's suits since her tenure on the series began with 1995's *GoldenEye*, but Lindsay Pugh, another supervisor, explained their suits were \"too relaxed\". Tom Ford was hired to tailor \"sharper\" suits for Craig. Pugh said the costumes aimed towards the 1960s feel, especially for Bond and Fields. Prada provided the dresses for both Bond girls. Jasper Conran designed Camille's ginger bandeau, bronze skirt and gold fish necklace,[87] while Chrome Hearts designed gothic jewelry for Amalric's character, which the actor liked enough to keep.[88] Sophie Harley, who created Vesper Lynd's earrings and Algerian loveknot necklace in *Casino Royale*, was asked to create another version of the necklace.[89]\n\n\nThe film returns to the traditional gun barrel opening shot, which was altered into part of the story for *Casino Royale* where it was moved to the beginning of the title sequence. In this film, the gun barrel sequence was moved to the end, which Wilson explained was done for a surprise,[90] and to signify that the conclusion of the story had begun in the previous film. The opening credits were created by MK12. Having worked on Forster's *Stranger than Fiction* and *The Kite Runner*, MK12 spontaneously began developing the sequence early on, and had a good idea of its appearance which meant it did not have to be redone when the title singer was changed. MK12 selected various twilight colours to represent Bond's mood and focused on a dot motif based on the gun barrel shot. MK12 also worked on scenes with graphical user interfaces, including the electronic table MI6 uses,[91] and the Port-au-Prince, Haiti title cards.[92]\n\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\n![A black car in an exhibition.](image)Aston Martin DBS V12 on display at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International\n*Quantum of Solace* was the last in Ford Motor's three-film deal that began with 2002's *Die Another Day*. Although Ford sold over 90% of the Aston Martin company in 2007, the Aston Martin DBS V12 returned for the film's car chase around Lake Garda;[93] Dan Bradley was hired as second unit director because of his work on the second and third *Bourne* films, so the film would continue the gritty action style begun in *Casino Royale*.[94] He had intended to use Ford GTs for the opening chase,[95] but it was replaced by the Alfa Romeo 159.[96] After location filming in Italy, further close-ups of Craig, the cars and the truck were shot at Pinewood against a blue screen.[97] Originally, three Alfa Romeos were in the sequence, but Forster felt the scene was too long and re-edited it so there would be two Alfas were chasing Bond.[98] Ten cars were supplied by Aston Martin. Six 'hero' cars, needed for close-ups and promotional work, all survived filming unharmed with four more cars used for special effects and stunts.[99][*self-published source?*]\n\n\nFourteen cameras were used to film the Palio di Siena footage, which was later edited into the main sequence. Aerial shots using helicopters were banned, and the crew were also forbidden from showing any violence \"involving either people or animals.\"[55] To shoot the foot chase in Siena in April 2008 four camera cranes were built in the town, and a cable camera was also used.[60] Framestore worked on the Siena chase, duplicating the 1,000 extras during principal photography to match shots of the 40,000-strong audience at the real Palio, removing wires that held Craig and the stuntmen in the rooftop segment of the chase, and digital expansion of the floor and skylight in the art gallery Bond and Mitchell fall into.[97] The art gallery fight was intended to be simple, but during filming Craig's stunt double accidentally fell from the construction scaffolding. Forster preferred the idea of Bond hanging from ropes reaching for his gun to kill Mitchell, rather than having both men run out of the building to continue their chase as specified in the script, and the number of effects shots increased.[97]\n\n\nTo film the aerial dogfight, a \"Snakehead\" camera was built and placed on the nose and tail of a Piper Aerostar 700. SolidWorks, who provided the software used to design the camera, stated \"pilots for the first time can fly as aggressively as they dare without sacrificing the drama of the shot.\" The camera could turn 360 degrees and was shaped like a periscope.[100] The crew also mounted SpaceCams on helicopters, and placed cameras with 1600mm lenses underground, to cover the action.[58] Forster wanted to film the plane fight as a homage to Alfred Hitchcock's *North by Northwest*, and chose planes like the Douglas DC-3 to suit that.[85][101]\n\n\nThe free-fall scene involved its own set of challenges; director Marc Forster didn't want to shoot the scene against a green screen.[102] The scene was shot in an air tunnel at Bodyflight, which offers the same effects as skydiving.[102] Daniel Craig and Olga Kurylenko did their own stunts for this scene.[102] While a great solution for the actors' performances, the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the sky over the Bolivian desert; and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight Dalsa Origin cameras (supported by seven HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was used to create a virtual camera with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at Double Negative[98] developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in a synthetic environment as seen by a synthetic camera.\nDuring the shooting in the wind tunnel Craig and Kurylenko wore wind-resistant contact lenses that enabled them to open their eyes as they fell. For safety and comfort, they only shot for 30 seconds at a time.[103] Forster wished he had had more time to work on the free-fall scene.[97]\n\n\nThe Moving Picture Company created the climactic hotel sequence. The fire effects were supervised by Chris Corbould, and post-production MPC had to enhance the sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, so it would look more dangerous.[97] A full-scale replica of the building's exterior was used for the exploding part Bond and Camille escape from. The boat chase was another scene that required very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing a few shots of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head,[98] and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle to make it look more dangerous.[97] Crowd creation was done for the *Tosca* scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out.[98] Forster edited the opera scene to resemble *The Man Who Knew Too Much*.[66] In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in *Quantum of Solace*.[97]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Quantum of Solace (soundtrack)\n\nDavid Arnold, who composed the scores for the previous four Bond films, returned for *Quantum of Solace*. He said that Forster likes to work very closely with his composers and that, in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied to on *Casino Royale*, the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to \"really work it out.\" He also said he would be \"taking a different approach\" with the score.[104] Arnold composed the music based on impressions from reading the script, and Forster edited those into the film.[105] As with *Casino Royale*, Arnold kept use of the \"James Bond Theme\" to a minimum.[49] Arnold collaborated with Kieran Hebden for \"Crawl, End Crawl,\" a remix of the score played during the end credits.[106]\n\n\nJack White of The White Stripes and Alicia Keys collaborated on \"Another Way to Die,\" the first Bond music duet.[107][108] They had wanted to work together for two years beforehand.[109] The song was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee; White played the drums while Keys performed on the piano.[110] The Memphis Horns also contributed to the track.[109] White's favourite Bond theme is John Barry's instrumental piece for *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*, and he watched various opening credit sequences from the series for inspiration while mixing the track.[110] Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse had recorded a demo track for the film,[111] but Ronson explained Winehouse's well-publicised legal issues in the preceding weeks made her \"not ready to record any music\" at that time.[112]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\nThe film premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 29 October 2008. Princes William and Harry attended, and proceeds from the screening were donated to the charities Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion.[113] The film was originally scheduled to be released in the UK and North America on 7 November; however, Eon pushed forward the British date to 31 October during filming,[114] while the American date was pushed back in August to 14 November, after *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* had been moved to 2009, thereby allowing the distributors to market the film over the autumn blockbuster Thanksgiving holiday weekend.[115] In Australia, the film was moved a week to 19 November, after 20th Century Fox chose to release *Australia* on *Quantum of Solace*'s original date of 26 November.[116]\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nReturning product placement partners from *Casino Royale* included Ford, Heineken, Smirnoff, Omega SA, Virgin Atlantic and Sony Ericsson.[117] A reported £50 million was earned in product placement, which tops the Bond films' record of £44 million for *Die Another Day*.[118] The 2009 Ford Ka is driven by Camille in the film.[119] Avon created a fragrance called Bond Girl 007 with Gemma Arterton as the \"face\" of the product.[120] Coca-Cola became a promotional partner, rebranding Coke Zero as \"Coke Zero Zero 7.\" A tie-in advert featured the orchestral element of \"Another Way to Die.\"[121] In the film, Coca-Cola was briefly seen being served at Dominic Greene's party. Sony held a competition, \"Mission for a Million,\" enabling registered players to use their products to complete certain tasks. Each completed \"mission\" gave consumers a chance to win $1 million and a trip to a top-secret location.[122]\n\n\n\n#### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nCorgi International Limited made 5-inch action figures and gadgets (such as a voice-activated briefcase), as well as its traditional die-cast toy vehicles.[123][124] It also created 7-inch figures of characters from the previous films.[125] Scalextric released four racing sets to coincide with the film.[126] Activision released its first James Bond game, also titled *Quantum of Solace*, which is based on both *Casino Royale* and *Quantum of Solace*. It is the first Bond game to feature Craig's likeness and the first seventh-generation console game in the series. Swatch designed a series of wrist watches, each of them inspired by a Bond villain.[127]\n\n\nThough the screenplay was not novelised despite its original storyline, Penguin Books published a compilation of Fleming's short stories entitled *Quantum of Solace: The Complete James Bond Short Stories*, with a UK release date of 29 May 2008[128] and a North American release date of 26 August 2008.[129] The book combines the contents of Fleming's two short story collections, *For Your Eyes Only*—including the original \"Quantum of Solace\" short story—and *Octopussy and The Living Daylights*.\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Quantum of Solace* was released on DVD and Blu-ray by MGM via 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in Australia, the UK and North America from 18 to 24 March 2009. On the DVD sales chart the film opened at No. 3, grossing $21,894,957 from 1.21m DVD units sold.[130] As of 1 November 2009[update], 2,643,250 DVD units were sold, generating $44,110,750 in sales revenue.[130] These figures do not include Blu-ray sales or DVD rentals. The DVDs were released in both a standard one-disc set and a deluxe two-disc special edition. There are no audio commentaries or deleted scenes on these editions.[131]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nUpon its opening in the UK, the film grossed £4.9 million ($8 million), breaking the record for the largest Friday opening (31 October 2008) in the UK.[132] The film then broke the UK opening-weekend record, taking £15.5 million ($25 million) in its first weekend, surpassing the previous record of £14.9 million held by *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*. It earned a further £14 million in France and Sweden—where it opened on the same day. The weekend gross of the equivalent of $10.6 million in France was a record for the series, surpassing what *Casino Royale* made in five days by 16%. The $2.7 million gross in Sweden was the fourth-highest opening for a film there.[133][134]\n\n\nThe following week, the film was playing in 60 countries. It grossed the equivalent of $39.3 million in the UK, $16.5 million in France and $7.7 million in Germany on 7 November 2008.[135] The film broke records in Switzerland, Finland, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Romania and Slovenia. Its Chinese and Indian openings were the second-largest ever for foreign-language films.[136]\n\n\nThe film grossed $27 million on its opening day in 3,451 cinemas in Canada and the United States, where it was the number one film for the weekend, with $67.5 million and $19,568 average per cinema.[137] It was the highest-grossing opening weekend *Bond* film in the US,[138] and tied with *The Incredibles* for the biggest November opening outside of the *Harry Potter* series. From the British opening on 31 October, through to the US opening weekend on 14 November, the film had grossed a total $319,128,882 worldwide. The film grossed $168.4 million in Canada and the US, and $421.2 million in other territories, for a total of $589.6 million.[4]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 63% based on 301 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Brutal and breathless, *Quantum Of Solace* delivers tender emotions along with frenetic action, but coming on the heels of *Casino Royale*, it's still a bit of a disappointment.\"[139] On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[140] Critics generally preferred *Casino Royale*, but continued to praise Craig's depiction of Bond, and agree that the film is still an enjoyable addition to the series. The action sequences and pacing were praised, but criticism grew over the realism and serious but gritty feeling that the film carried over.[141] The film earned an average grade of \"B−\" from CinemaScore's audience surveys, on an A+ to F scale, the lowest of the Craig's era as Bond.[142]\n\n\nRoger Moore, the third actor to play Bond in the films, said that Craig was a \"damn good Bond but the film as a whole, there was a bit too much flash cutting [and] it was just like a commercial of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what the hell was going on.\"[143] Kim Newman of *Empire* magazine gave it a 4/5 rating, remarking it was not \"bigger and better than *Casino Royale*, [which is] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun.\" However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films.[144] *The Sunday Times* review noted that \"following *Casino Royale* was never going to be easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth—with a yawn\"; the screenplay \"is at times incomprehensible\" and the casting \"is a mess.\" The review concludes that \"Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism.\"[145] *The Guardian* gave the film 3 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he \"made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage\" and calling the film \"a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement\"; it concludes \"*Quantum of Solace* isn't as good as *Casino Royale*: the smart elegance of Daniel Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up.\"[146]\n\n\n*Screen Daily* says, \"Notices will focus—rightly—on Craig's magnetism as the steely, sexy, murderous MI6 agent, but two other factors weigh in and freshen up proceedings: Forster's new technical team, led by cinematographer Roberto Schaefer and production designer Dennis Gassner. And the ongoing shift of M, as played by Judi Dench, to front and centre: the Bond girls fade into insignificance as she becomes his moral counterpoint and theirs is the only real relationship on screen.\" The review continues, \"Bond is, as has been previously noted, practically the Martin Scorsese of the BAFTAs: 22 films later, with grosses probably close to the GDP of one of the small nations it depicts, it's still waiting for that Alexander Korda award. The best *Casino Royale* could achieve was a gong for sound. Will this be the year that changes its fortunes?\"[147] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times*, who praised the previous film, disliked *Quantum of Solace*. He wrote that the plot was mediocre, characters weak, and that Bond lacked his usual personality, despite his praise for Craig's interpretation of the role. Throughout his review, he emphasised that \"James Bond is not an action hero.\"[148] Kate Muir wrote in *The Times* that \"The *Bond* franchise is 50 years old this year, and the scriptless mess of *Quantum of Solace* may be considered its mid-life crisis\", before she went on to praise the film's successor *Skyfall* as a \"resurrection\".[149] Some writers criticised the choice of *Quantum of Solace* as a title. \"Yes, it's a bad title,\" wrote Marni Weisz, the editor of *Famous*, a Canadian film publication distributed in cinemas in that country, in an editorial entitled \"At least it's not *Octopussy*.\"[150]\n\n\nNot all the reviews were as critical. Tim Robey of *The Daily Telegraph*, in a reflective review of the film in 2013, was positive. He praised the film's shorter runtime, claiming that many other *Bond* films run out of steam before the end, and included *Casino Royale* in this category. Describing the film as having a \"rock-solid dramatic idea and the intelligence to run with it\", he gave the film four stars out of five.[151]\n\n\nCraig retrospectively stated that the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike negatively impacted on the production and end result of *Quantum of Solace*,[152][153] During a 2021 interview on *The Empire Film Podcast*, Craig described the film as a \"shit-show\" and referred to it as one of his least favourite performances as Bond.[154]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nThe film was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Visual Effects, Film and Sound Editing at the 2008 Satellite Awards, winning Best Song.[155] It was nominated for Best Action Movie at the 2009 Critics' Choice Awards,[156] and at the Empire Awards, which is voted for by the public, it was shortlisted for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Newcomer, Best Thriller and Best Soundtrack.[157] It was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, while Kurylenko and Dench were both nominated for the Best Supporting Actress award.[158] It was nominated by the Visual Effects Society Awards for \"Outstanding Compositing in a Feature Motion Picture.\"[159]\n\n\nMovie critic Gilbert Cruz listed the film's pre-titles sequence as the eighth-greatest car chase in film history.[160]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Eco-terrorism in fiction\n* Outline of James Bond\n* Cochabamba Water War\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"AFI-Catalog\". *catalog.afi.com*.\n2. **^** \"Quantum of Solace\". *Lumiere*.

It is the sequel to *Casino Royale* (2006). Directed by Marc Forster and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis, it stars Daniel Craig as Bond, alongside Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, Giancarlo Giannini, Jeffrey Wright, and Judi Dench. In the film, Bond teams with Camille Montes (Kurylenko) to stop Dominic Greene (Amalric) from staging a *coup d'état* in Bolivia to access the country's natural reserves.\n\n\nA second Bond film starring Craig was planned before production began on *Casino Royale* in October 2005. In July 2006, Roger Michell was announced to direct with a planned release for May 2008, but he left the project that October after there were delays with the screenplay. Purvis, Wade, and Haggis completed the screenplay by June 2007, after which, Forster was announced as Michell's replacement. Craig and Forster also contributed uncredited rewrites to the film's screenplay. Principal photography began in August 2007 and lasted until May 2008, with filming locations including Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria, and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at Pinewood Studios. The film's title is borrowed from a 1959 short story by Ian Fleming. In contrast to its predecessor, *Quantum of Solace* is notable for citing inspiration from early Bond film sets designed by Ken Adam, while it features a departure from tropes associated with Bond villains.\n\n\n*Quantum of Solace* premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 29 October 2008, and was theatrically released first in the United Kingdom two days later and in the United States on 14 November. The film received generally mixed reviews, with praise for Craig's performance and the action sequences but was deemed inferior to its predecessor. It grossed $589 million worldwide, becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of 2008 and the fourth-highest-grossing *James Bond* film, unadjusted for inflation. The next film in the series, *Skyfall*, was released in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nImmediately following the events of *Casino Royale*, James Bond is driving from Lake Garda to Siena, Italy, with the captured Mr. White in the trunk of his Aston Martin DBS V12. After evading pursuers, Bond delivers White to M, who interrogates White regarding the mysterious organisation Quantum. When White responds that their operatives are everywhere, M's bodyguard Craig Mitchell suddenly shoots one of the guards and attacks M. Bond chases Mitchell and eventually kills him; in the confusion, White escapes. Searching Mitchell's flat in London, Bond and M discover Mitchell had a contact named Edmund Slate in Haiti. Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill Camille Montes at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur Dominic Greene. Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano, who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow the government and become the new president in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\n\nAfter foiling Camille's assassination attempt on Medrano by \"rescuing\" her, Bond follows Greene to a performance of *Tosca* in Bregenz, Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the CIA's South American section, Gregg Beam, along with agent Felix Leiter, strike a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil, which the CIA believes to be the reason for Greene's interest in the land. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying Quantum's executive board members, and a gunfight ensues. A Special Branch bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British PM, is thrown off a roof by Bond after refusing to answer his questions. He lands on Greene's car and is shot dead by one of his men. Assuming Bond killed the bodyguard, M orders him back to MI6 for debriefing. When he disobeys, she revokes his passports and cancels his payment cards. Bond heads to Talamone and convinces his old ally René Mathis to accompany him to Bolivia. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields, a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her, and they attend a fundraising party held by Greene. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene, and they leave. The Bolivian police pull Bond and Camille over but discover Mathis unconscious in the car's boot. One of the officers shoots Mathis before Bond kills both of them. Mathis dies in Bond's arms, urging him to forgive Vesper and himself.\n\n\nThe following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is damaged by a Bolivian fighter plane. They trick the plane into destroying itself, skydive into a sinkhole, and discover that Quantum has been secretly damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a monopoly. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in crude oil. Bond meets Leiter, who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet at a hotel, *La Perla de las Dunas*, in the Atacama Desert to finalize their agreement, and warns him to escape as the CIA's Special Activities Division arrives.\n\n\nBond and Camille infiltrate the hotel, where Greene blackmails Medrano into signing a contract that will make Medrano the leader of Bolivia in exchange for the land rights, making Greene Bolivia's sole water provider at significantly higher rates. Bond kills the police chief for betraying Mathis, and after killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the rapes and murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel (which is powered by flammable hydrogen fuel cells) destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum. Bond leaves him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil. Bond and Camille share a kiss, and she wishes him luck in conquering his demons.\n\n\nBond travels to Kazan, Russia, where he finds Vesper Lynd's former lover, Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces female agents with valuable connections and is indirectly responsible for her death. After saving Kabira's latest target, Corrine, who works in Canadian intelligence, Bond allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice in the head with some engine oil found in his stomach. Bond admits that M was right about Vesper. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Bond drops Vesper's necklace behind him as he walks away in the snow.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Daniel Craig as James Bond. Craig's physical training for his reprise of the role placed extra effort into running and boxing, to spare him the injuries he sustained on his stunts in the first film.[6] Craig felt he was fitter, being less bulky than in the first film.[7] He also practised speedboating and stunt driving. Craig felt *Casino Royale* was [physically] \"a walk in the park\" compared to *Quantum of Solace*, which required a different performance from him because *Quantum of Solace* is a revenge film, not a love story like *Casino Royale*.[7] While filming in Pinewood, he suffered a gash when kicked in his face,[8] which required eight stitches, and a fingertip was sliced off. He laughed these off, noting they did not delay filming, and joked his finger would enable him to have a criminal career (though it had grown back when he made this comment).[7] He also had minor plastic surgery on his face.[9] The actor advised Paul Haggis on the script and helped choose Marc Forster as the director.[10]\n* Olga Kurylenko as Camille Montes, a Bolivian agent with her own vendetta regarding Greene and Medrano. Forster chose her because out of the 400 women who auditioned, she seemed the least nervous.[11] When she read the script, she was glad she had no love scene with Craig; she felt it would have distracted viewers from her performance.[12] Kurylenko spent three weeks training to fight with weapons, and she learnt a form of indoor skydiving known as body flying.[13] Kurylenko said she had to do \"training non-stop from the morning to the evening\" for the action scenes, overcoming her fears with the help of Craig and the stunt team.[14][15] She was given a DVD box set of Bond films, since the franchise was not easily available to watch in her native Ukraine.[13] Kurylenko found Michelle Yeoh in *Tomorrow Never Dies* inspiring \"because she did the fight scenes by herself.\"[11] The producers had intended to cast a South American actress in the role,[16] thus, Kurylenko trained with a dialect coach to perform with a Spanish accent.[15] She said that the accent was easy for her because she has \"a lot of Hispanic friends, from Latin America and Spain, and it's an accent I've always heard\".[17] When reflecting on her experience as a Bond girl, she stated she was proudest of overcoming her fears in performing stunts.[18]\n* Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene, the main villain. He is a leading member of Quantum posing as a businessman working in reforestation and charity funding for environmental science. In the 2015 Bond film *Spectre*, he is revealed to have been a member of the titular crime syndicate, of which Quantum is a subsidiary. Amalric acknowledged taking the role was an easy decision because, \"It's impossible to say to your kids that 'I could have been in a Bond film but I refused.'\"[13] Amalric wanted to wear make-up for the role, but Forster explained that he wanted Greene not to look grotesque, but to symbolise the hidden evils in society.[8] Amalric modelled his performance on \"the smile of Tony Blair [and] the craziness of Sarkozy\", the latter of whom he called \"the worst villain we [the French] have ever had … he walks around thinking he's in a Bond film.\"[19] He later claimed this was not criticism of either politician, but rather an example of how a politician relies on performance instead of a genuine policy to win power. \"Sarkozy, is just a better actor than [his presidential opponent] Ségolène Royal—that's all,\" he explained.[20] Amalric and Forster reconceived the character, who was supposed to have a \"special skill\" in the script, to someone who uses pure animal instinct when fighting Bond in the climax.[21] Bruno Ganz was also considered for the part,[16] but Forster decided Amalric gave the character a 'pitiful' quality.[21]\n* Giancarlo Giannini as René Mathis, Bond's ally who was mistakenly believed to be a traitor in *Casino Royale*. Having been acquitted, he chooses to help Bond again in his quest to find out who betrayed him.\n* Gemma Arterton as MI6 agent Strawberry Fields, who works at the British consulate in Bolivia. Fields, who is merely an office worker as described by M, takes herself seriously and tries to overpower Bond when the pair meet. She is later seduced by Bond, infiltrates Greene's fund raiser party with him and ends up paying the ultimate price. Forster found Arterton a witty actress and selected her from a reported 1,500 candidates. One of the casting directors asked her to audition for the role, having seen her portray Rosaline in *Love's Labour's Lost* at the Globe Theatre.[22] Arterton said Fields was \"not so frolicsome\" as other Bond girls, but is instead \"fresh and young, not ... a femme fatale\".[23] Arterton described Fields as a homage to the 1960s Bond girls, comparing her red wig to that of Diana Rigg, who played Tracy Bond in *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*. Rigg, alongside Honor Blackman, is one of her favourite Bond girls.[22] Arterton had to film her character's death scene first day on the set, where she was completely covered head to toe in non-toxic black paint. The character's full name, which is a reference to the Beatles song \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", is never actually uttered on screen; when she introduces herself to Bond, she says \"Mr Bond, my name is Fields, I'm from the Consulate.\". Robert A. Caplen suggests that this is a conscious effort to portray a woman 'whose character attributes are neither undermined nor compromised' by her name, even though her name may have sexual overtones reminiscent of earlier Bond girls.[24] In August 2018, Arterton wrote a short story titled Woke Woman based on the character.[25]\n* Anatole Taubman as Elvis, Greene's second-in-command. Taubman wanted to make Elvis \"as colourful, as edgy and as interesting as possible\", with one of his suggestions being the bowl cut.[26] Amalric and Taubman improvised a backstory for Elvis: he is Dominic's cousin and once lived on the streets before being inducted into Quantum. He called Elvis \"a bit of a goofball. He thinks he's all that but he's not really. … He's not a comic guy. He definitely takes himself very serious, but maybe by his taking himself too serious he may become friendly\".[27]\n* Jesper Christensen as Mr. White, whom Bond captured after he stole the money won at *Casino Royale* in Montenegro.\n* David Harbour as Gregg Beam, the CIA section chief for South America and a contact of Felix Leiter.\n* Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner, M's chief of staff.[28]\n* Tim Pigott-Smith as the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.\n* Joaquín Cosío as General Medrano, the exiled general whom Greene is helping to get back into power, in return for support of his organisation. He murdered Camille's entire family when she was a young girl.\n* Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter, Bond's ally at the CIA. Early script drafts gave Leiter a larger role, but his screentime was restricted by on-set rewrites.[29]\n* Judi Dench as M. Forster felt Dench was underused in the previous films and wanted to make her part bigger, having her interact with Bond more because she is \"the only woman Bond doesn't see in a sexual context\", which Forster finds interesting.[30]\n* Fernando Guillén Cuervo as Carlos, the Colonel of Bolivian Police, the chief of all police forces, and the contact of René Mathis in Bolivia.\n* Paul Ritter as Guy Haines, special envoy to the Prime Minister and a member of Quantum.\n* Neil Jackson as Edmund Slate, a henchman who fights Bond in Haiti.\n* Simon Kassianides as Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces female agents and manipulates them into giving away classified information. He is indirectly responsible for Vesper Lynd's death.\n* Stana Katic as Corrine Veneau, a Canadian agent and Yusef's latest target.\n* Glenn Foster as Craig Mitchell, M's bodyguard and a double agent.\n* Oona Chaplin as Perla de las Dunas's receptionist, a woman saved by Camille Montes in one of the last sequences.\n* Lucrezia Lante della Rovere as Gemma, Mathis's girlfriend.\n* Jesús Ochoa as Lieutenant Orso, a bodyguard of the exiled General Medrano\n\n\nMarc Forster asked his friends and fellow directors Guillermo del Toro and Alfonso Cuarón to appear in cameos. Cuarón appears as a Bolivian helicopter pilot, while del Toro provides several other voices.[31]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n\n> If you remember in *Chinatown*, if you control the water you control the whole development of the country. I think it's true. Right now it appears to be oil, but there's a lot of other resources that we don't think about too much but are all essential, and they're very limited and every country needs it. Because every country knows that raising the standard of living (and populations are getting bigger) is the way we're all going.\n> \n> — Michael G. Wilson on the plot.[29]\n> \n\n\nIn October 2005, before the beginning of production of *Casino Royale*, Michael G. Wilson announced that Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were working on a screenplay for the next film. They deliberately wrote *Casino Royale* to tie in to the next film so they could exploit Bond's emotions following Vesper's death in the previous film.[32] Purvis and Wade's first storyline followed Bond releasing Mr. White in Siena so that he could follow him and find his employers. Bond would later infiltrate the mysterious organisation, which is being led by the villain, Dante, who is aligned with Yusuf Kabira, Vesper's boyfriend.[33] In July 2006, as *Casino Royale* entered post-production, Eon Productions announced Roger Michell, who directed Craig in *Enduring Love* and *The Mother*, had entered negotiations to direct, and the next film would be based on an original idea by Wilson.[34] The film was confirmed for a 2 May 2008 release date, with Craig reprising the lead role.[35] Months later, in October 2006, Michell stepped down as director citing the slow progress on the script.[36] Upon Michell's departure, Sony Entertainment vice chairman Jeff Blake admitted a production schedule of 18 months was a very short window, and the release date was pushed back to late 2008.[37] Purvis and Wade completed their draft of the script by April 2007,[38] and Paul Haggis, who polished the *Casino Royale* script, began his rewrite the next month.[39] Work on script was delayed by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Haggis's draft was originally titled *Sleep of the Dead*.[40]\n\n\nFollowing Michell's departure, Tony Scott, Jonathan Mostow, Marc Forster, and Alex Proyas were under consideration to replace him.[39] In June 2007, Forster was confirmed as director.[41] He was surprised that he was approached for the job, stating he was not a big Bond film fan, and that he would not have accepted had he not seen *Casino Royale* which he felt had humanised Bond; since travelling the world had become less exotic since the series's advent, it made sense to focus more on Bond as a character. Born in Germany and raised in Switzerland, Forster was the first Bond director not to come from the British Commonwealth of Nations, although he noted that Bond's mother is Swiss, making him somewhat appropriate to handle the British icon.[42] The director collaborated strongly with Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, noting they only blocked two very expensive ideas he had.[16] The director found *Casino Royale*'s 144-minute running time too long, and wanted his follow-up to be \"tight and fast … like a bullet\".[43]\n\n\n\n\n> Because Bond plays it real, I thought the political circumstances should be real too, even though Bond shouldn't be a political film. I thought the more political I make it, the more real it feels, not just with Bolivia and what's happening in Haiti, but with all these corporations like Shell and Chevron saying they're green because it's so fashionable to be green. During the Cold War, everything was very clear, the good guys and the bad guys. Today there's much overlapping of good and bad. It isn't as morally distinct, because we all have both elements in us.\n> \n> — Marc Forster on the political landscape of the film.[44]\n> \n\n\nHaggis, Forster and Wilson rewrote the story.[45] Haggis said he completed his script two hours before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike officially began.[42] Forster noted a running theme in his films was emotionally repressed protagonists, and the theme of the picture would be Bond learning to trust after feeling betrayed by Vesper.[46] Forster said he created the Camille character as a strong female counterpart to Bond rather than a casual love interest; she openly shows emotions similar to those which Bond experiences but is unable to express.[47] Haggis located his draft's climax in the Swiss Alps,[48] but Forster wanted the action sequences to be based around the four classical elements of earth, water, air and fire.[49] The decision to homage Oddjob's murder of Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) in *Goldfinger* in Fields's death came about as Forster wanted to show oil had replaced gold as the most precious material.[44] The producers rejected Haggis's idea that Vesper Lynd had a child, because \"Bond was an orphan ... Once he finds the kid, Bond can't just leave the kid\".[50] The water supply issue in Bolivia was the main theme, with a story based on the Cochabamba Water Revolt.[51]\n\n\nWilson decided on the title *Quantum of Solace* only \"a few days\" before its announcement on 24 January 2008.[23] It was the name of a short story in Ian Fleming's anthology *For Your Eyes Only* (1960).[52] The film is related to the title in one of its thematic elements: \"when the *Quantum of Solace* drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone\". Daniel Craig admitted, \"I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in your relationship then the relationship is over. It's that spark of niceness in a relationship that if you don't have you might as well give up.\"[13] He said that \"Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend [Vesper Lynd] has been killed\",[52] and therefore, \"[Bond is] looking for revenge … to make himself happy with the world again\".[23] Afterwards, Quantum was made the name of the organisation introduced in *Casino Royale*.[53] Craig noted the letter Q itself looks rather odd.[7] Near the end of the film, the Camille Montes character and Bond have a discussion about their individual quests to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Montes asks Bond to \"let me know what it feels like\" when he succeeds, the implication of the title being that it will be a small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.\n\n\nIn a December 2011 interview, Craig stated: \"We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers' strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes—and a writer I am not\".[54] He said that he and Forster \"were the ones allowed to do it. The rules were that you couldn't employ anyone as a writer, but the actor and director could work on scenes together. We were stuffed. We got away with it, but only just. It was never meant to be as much of a sequel as it was, but it ended up being a sequel, starting where the last one finished\".[54]\n\n\nDuring filming, after the strike ended, Forster liked a spec script by Joshua Zetumer, and hired him to reshape scenes for the later parts of the shoot, with which the director was still unsatisfied.[45] Forster had the actors rehearse their scenes, as he liked to film scenes continually.[20] Zetumer rewrote dialogue depending on the actors' ideas each day.[20]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Strada delle Forre* in Tremosine (Italy) where the movie begins.\n*Quantum of Solace* was shot in six countries.[5] Second unit filming began in Italy at the Palio di Siena horse race on 16 August 2007,[55] although at that point Forster was unsure how it would fit into the film.[49] Some scenes were filmed also in Maratea and Craco, two small distinctive towns in Basilicata in southern Italy.[56] Other places used for location shooting were Madrid in August 2007;[57] Baja California, Mexico in early 2008, for shots of the aerial battle;[58][59] Malcesine, Limone sul Garda and Tremosine in Italy during March,[60] and at Talamone during the end of April.[61] The main unit began on 3 January 2008[16] at Pinewood Studios. The 007 Stage was used for the fight in the art gallery,[13] and an MI6 safehouse hidden within the city's cisterns,[62] while other stages housed Bond's Bolivian hotel suite,[63] and the MI6 headquarters.[62] Interior and exterior airport scenes were filmed at Farnborough Airfield and the snowy closing scenes were filmed at the Bruneval Barracks in Aldershot.[64]\n\n\nShooting in Panama City began on 7 February 2008 at Howard Air Force Base. The country doubled for Haiti and Bolivia, with the National Institute of Culture of Panama standing in for a hotel in the latter country. A sequence requiring several hundred extras was also shot at nearby Colón.[65] Shooting in Panama was also carried out at Fort Sherman, a former US military base on the Colón coast. Forster was disappointed he could only shoot the boat chase in that harbour, as he had a more spectacular vision for the scene.[66] Officials in the country worked with the locals to \"minimise inconvenience\" for the cast and crew, and in return hoped the city's exposure in the film would increase tourism.[67] The crew was going to move to Cusco, Peru for ten days of filming on 2 March,[65] but the location was cancelled for budget reasons.[5] Twelve days of filming in Chile began on 24 March at Antofagasta. There was shooting in Cobija, the Paranal Observatory, and other locations in the Atacama Desert.[68] Forster chose the desert and the observatory's ESO Hotel to represent Bond's rigid emotions, and being on the verge of committing a vengeful act as he confronts Greene in the film's climax.[53][69]\n\n\n\n![A scientific facility in a desert](image)Marc Forster chose the Atacama Desert to represent Bond's vengefulness in the climax.\nDuring filming in Sierra Gorda, Chile, the local mayor, Carlos Lopez, staged a protest because he was angry at the filmmakers' portrayal of the Antofagasta Region as part of Bolivia. He was arrested, detained briefly, and put on trial two days later. Eon dismissed his claim that they needed his permission to film in the area.[70][71] Michael G. Wilson explained that Bolivia was appropriate to the plot, because of the country's history of water problems,[69] and was surprised the two countries disliked each other a century after the War of the Pacific.[72] In a poll by Chilean daily newspaper *La Segunda*, 75 per cent of its readers disagreed with Lopez's actions, due to the negative image of Chile they felt it presented, and the controversy's potential to put off productions looking to film in the country in the future.[73]\n\n\nFrom 4–12 April, the main unit shot on Sienese rooftops.[61] Shooting on the real rooftops turned out to be less expensive than building them at Pinewood.[5] The next four weeks were scheduled for filming the car chase at Lake Garda and Carrara.[61] On 14 April, a closing scene featuring Jesper Christensen's Mr. White and Paul Ritter's Guy Haines getting killed by Bond after Bond said his iconic \"Bond, James Bond\" line was reportedly filmed, but the filmmakers removed it during post-production in case they decided to bring back Mr. White and/or continue the Quantum story arc in future sequels. The scene's deletion later enabled Mr. White's return in *Spectre*.[74] On 19 April, an Aston Martin employee driving a DBS to the set crashed into the lake. He survived, and was fined £400 for reckless driving.[75] Another accident occurred on 21 April, and two days later, two stuntmen were seriously injured, with one, Greek stuntman Aris Comninos, having to be put in intensive care. Filming of the scenes was temporarily halted so that Italian police could investigate the causes of the accidents.[76] Stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell said the accidents were a testament to the realism of the action.[48] Rumours of a \"curse\" spread among tabloid media, something which deeply offended Craig, who disliked that they compared Comninos's accident to something like his minor finger injury later on the shoot (also part of the \"curse\"). Comninos recovered safely from his injury.[7]\n\n\nFor the role Craig trained to be less bulky than in *Casino Royale* and told *Men's Fitness* magazine \"In fact, I was much fitter for this film compared to *Casino Royale* – I really had to be – and I was running a hell of a lot more in training, just so I could do these scenes, whereas last time I spent far more time pumping heavy weights to bulk up so I could look big.\"[77]\n\n\nFilming took place at the floating opera stage at Bregenz, Austria, from 28 April – 9 May 2008. The sequence in which Bond stalks the villains during a performance of *Tosca* required 1,500 extras.[78] The production used a large model of an eye, which Forster felt fitted in the Bond style, and the opera itself has parallels to the film.[79] A short driving sequence was filmed at the nearby Feldkirch, Vorarlberg.[80] The crew returned to Italy from 13 to 17 May to shoot a (planned) car crash at the marble quarry in Carrara,[81] and a recreation of the Palio di Siena at the Piazza del Campo in Siena. 1,000 extras were hired for a scene where Bond emerges from the *Fonte Gaia*. Originally, he would have emerged from the city's cisterns at Siena Cathedral, but this was thought disrespectful.[61] By June the crew returned to Pinewood for four weeks,[79] where new sets (including the interior of the hotel in the climax) were built.[45][63] The wrap party was held on 21 June.[82]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\nProduction designer Peter Lamont, a crew member on 18 previous Bond films, retired after *Casino Royale*.[83] Forster hired Dennis Gassner in his stead, having admired his work on *The Truman Show* and the films of the Coen brothers.[46] Craig said the film would have \"a touch of Ken Adam\",[84] while Michael G. Wilson also called Gassner's designs \"a postmodern look at modernism\".[63] Forster said he felt the early Bond films' design \"were ahead of their time\",[46] and enjoyed the clashing of an older style with his own because it created a unique look unto itself.[85] Gassner wanted his sets to emphasise Craig's \"great angular, textured face and wonderful blue eyes\", and totally redesigned the MI6 headquarters because he felt Judi Dench \"was a bit tired in the last film, so I thought, let's bring her into a new world\".[86]\n\n\nLouise Frogley replaced Lindy Hemming as costume designer, though Hemming remained as supervisor. Hemming hired Brioni for Bond's suits since her tenure on the series began with 1995's *GoldenEye*, but Lindsay Pugh, another supervisor, explained their suits were \"too relaxed\". Tom Ford was hired to tailor \"sharper\" suits for Craig. Pugh said the costumes aimed towards the 1960s feel, especially for Bond and Fields. Prada provided the dresses for both Bond girls. Jasper Conran designed Camille's ginger bandeau, bronze skirt and gold fish necklace,[87] while Chrome Hearts designed gothic jewelry for Amalric's character, which the actor liked enough to keep.[88] Sophie Harley, who created Vesper Lynd's earrings and Algerian loveknot necklace in *Casino Royale*, was asked to create another version of the necklace.[89]\n\n\nThe film returns to the traditional gun barrel opening shot, which was altered into part of the story for *Casino Royale* where it was moved to the beginning of the title sequence. In this film, the gun barrel sequence was moved to the end, which Wilson explained was done for a surprise,[90] and to signify that the conclusion of the story had begun in the previous film. The opening credits were created by MK12. Having worked on Forster's *Stranger than Fiction* and *The Kite Runner*, MK12 spontaneously began developing the sequence early on, and had a good idea of its appearance which meant it did not have to be redone when the title singer was changed. MK12 selected various twilight colours to represent Bond's mood and focused on a dot motif based on the gun barrel shot. MK12 also worked on scenes with graphical user interfaces, including the electronic table MI6 uses,[91] and the Port-au-Prince, Haiti title cards.[92]\n\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\n![A black car in an exhibition.](image)Aston Martin DBS V12 on display at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International\n*Quantum of Solace* was the last in Ford Motor's three-film deal that began with 2002's *Die Another Day*. Although Ford sold over 90% of the Aston Martin company in 2007, the Aston Martin DBS V12 returned for the film's car chase around Lake Garda;[93] Dan Bradley was hired as second unit director because of his work on the second and third *Bourne* films, so the film would continue the gritty action style begun in *Casino Royale*.[94] He had intended to use Ford GTs for the opening chase,[95] but it was replaced by the Alfa Romeo 159.[96] After location filming in Italy, further close-ups of Craig, the cars and the truck were shot at Pinewood against a blue screen.[97] Originally, three Alfa Romeos were in the sequence, but Forster felt the scene was too long and re-edited it so there would be two Alfas were chasing Bond.[98] Ten cars were supplied by Aston Martin. Six 'hero' cars, needed for close-ups and promotional work, all survived filming unharmed with four more cars used for special effects and stunts.[99][*self-published source?*]\n\n\nFourteen cameras were used to film the Palio di Siena footage, which was later edited into the main sequence. Aerial shots using helicopters were banned, and the crew were also forbidden from showing any violence \"involving either people or animals.\"[55] To shoot the foot chase in Siena in April 2008 four camera cranes were built in the town, and a cable camera was also used.[60] Framestore worked on the Siena chase, duplicating the 1,000 extras during principal photography to match shots of the 40,000-strong audience at the real Palio, removing wires that held Craig and the stuntmen in the rooftop segment of the chase, and digital expansion of the floor and skylight in the art gallery Bond and Mitchell fall into.[97] The art gallery fight was intended to be simple, but during filming Craig's stunt double accidentally fell from the construction scaffolding. Forster preferred the idea of Bond hanging from ropes reaching for his gun to kill Mitchell, rather than having both men run out of the building to continue their chase as specified in the script, and the number of effects shots increased.[97]\n\n\nTo film the aerial dogfight, a \"Snakehead\" camera was built and placed on the nose and tail of a Piper Aerostar 700. SolidWorks, who provided the software used to design the camera, stated \"pilots for the first time can fly as aggressively as they dare without sacrificing the drama of the shot.\" The camera could turn 360 degrees and was shaped like a periscope.[100] The crew also mounted SpaceCams on helicopters, and placed cameras with 1600mm lenses underground, to cover the action.[58] Forster wanted to film the plane fight as a homage to Alfred Hitchcock's *North by Northwest*, and chose planes like the Douglas DC-3 to suit that.[85][101]\n\n\nThe free-fall scene involved its own set of challenges; director Marc Forster didn't want to shoot the scene against a green screen.[102] The scene was shot in an air tunnel at Bodyflight, which offers the same effects as skydiving.[102] Daniel Craig and Olga Kurylenko did their own stunts for this scene.[102] While a great solution for the actors' performances, the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the sky over the Bolivian desert; and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight Dalsa Origin cameras (supported by seven HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was used to create a virtual camera with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at Double Negative[98] developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in a synthetic environment as seen by a synthetic camera.\nDuring the shooting in the wind tunnel Craig and Kurylenko wore wind-resistant contact lenses that enabled them to open their eyes as they fell. For safety and comfort, they only shot for 30 seconds at a time.[103] Forster wished he had had more time to work on the free-fall scene.[97]\n\n\nThe Moving Picture Company created the climactic hotel sequence. The fire effects were supervised by Chris Corbould, and post-production MPC had to enhance the sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, so it would look more dangerous.[97] A full-scale replica of the building's exterior was used for the exploding part Bond and Camille escape from. The boat chase was another scene that required very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing a few shots of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head,[98] and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle to make it look more dangerous.[97] Crowd creation was done for the *Tosca* scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out.[98] Forster edited the opera scene to resemble *The Man Who Knew Too Much*.[66] In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in *Quantum of Solace*.[97]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Quantum of Solace (soundtrack)\n\nDavid Arnold, who composed the scores for the previous four Bond films, returned for *Quantum of Solace*. He said that Forster likes to work very closely with his composers and that, in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied to on *Casino Royale*, the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to \"really work it out.\" He also said he would be \"taking a different approach\" with the score.[104] Arnold composed the music based on impressions from reading the script, and Forster edited those into the film.[105] As with *Casino Royale*, Arnold kept use of the \"James Bond Theme\" to a minimum.[49] Arnold collaborated with Kieran Hebden for \"Crawl, End Crawl,\" a remix of the score played during the end credits.[106]\n\n\nJack White of The White Stripes and Alicia Keys collaborated on \"Another Way to Die,\" the first Bond music duet.[107][108] They had wanted to work together for two years beforehand.[109] The song was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee; White played the drums while Keys performed on the piano.[110] The Memphis Horns also contributed to the track.[109] White's favourite Bond theme is John Barry's instrumental piece for *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*, and he watched various opening credit sequences from the series for inspiration while mixing the track.[110] Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse had recorded a demo track for the film,[111] but Ronson explained Winehouse's well-publicised legal issues in the preceding weeks made her \"not ready to record any music\" at that time.[112]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\nThe film premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 29 October 2008. Princes William and Harry attended, and proceeds from the screening were donated to the charities Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion.[113] The film was originally scheduled to be released in the UK and North America on 7 November; however, Eon pushed forward the British date to 31 October during filming,[114] while the American date was pushed back in August to 14 November, after *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* had been moved to 2009, thereby allowing the distributors to market the film over the autumn blockbuster Thanksgiving holiday weekend.[115] In Australia, the film was moved a week to 19 November, after 20th Century Fox chose to release *Australia* on *Quantum of Solace*'s original date of 26 November.[116]\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nReturning product placement partners from *Casino Royale* included Ford, Heineken, Smirnoff, Omega SA, Virgin Atlantic and Sony Ericsson.[117] A reported £50 million was earned in product placement, which tops the Bond films' record of £44 million for *Die Another Day*.[118] The 2009 Ford Ka is driven by Camille in the film.[119] Avon created a fragrance called Bond Girl 007 with Gemma Arterton as the \"face\" of the product.[120] Coca-Cola became a promotional partner, rebranding Coke Zero as \"Coke Zero Zero 7.\" A tie-in advert featured the orchestral element of \"Another Way to Die.\"[121] In the film, Coca-Cola was briefly seen being served at Dominic Greene's party. Sony held a competition, \"Mission for a Million,\" enabling registered players to use their products to complete certain tasks. Each completed \"mission\" gave consumers a chance to win $1 million and a trip to a top-secret location.[122]\n\n\n\n#### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nCorgi International Limited made 5-inch action figures and gadgets (such as a voice-activated briefcase), as well as its traditional die-cast toy vehicles.[123][124] It also created 7-inch figures of characters from the previous films.[125] Scalextric released four racing sets to coincide with the film.[126] Activision released its first James Bond game, also titled *Quantum of Solace*, which is based on both *Casino Royale* and *Quantum of Solace*. It is the first Bond game to feature Craig's likeness and the first seventh-generation console game in the series. Swatch designed a series of wrist watches, each of them inspired by a Bond villain.[127]\n\n\nThough the screenplay was not novelised despite its original storyline, Penguin Books published a compilation of Fleming's short stories entitled *Quantum of Solace: The Complete James Bond Short Stories*, with a UK release date of 29 May 2008[128] and a North American release date of 26 August 2008.[129] The book combines the contents of Fleming's two short story collections, *For Your Eyes Only*—including the original \"Quantum of Solace\" short story—and *Octopussy and The Living Daylights*.\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Quantum of Solace* was released on DVD and Blu-ray by MGM via 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in Australia, the UK and North America from 18 to 24 March 2009. On the DVD sales chart the film opened at No. 3, grossing $21,894,957 from 1.21m DVD units sold.[130] As of 1 November 2009[update], 2,643,250 DVD units were sold, generating $44,110,750 in sales revenue.[130] These figures do not include Blu-ray sales or DVD rentals. The DVDs were released in both a standard one-disc set and a deluxe two-disc special edition. There are no audio commentaries or deleted scenes on these editions.[131]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nUpon its opening in the UK, the film grossed £4.9 million ($8 million), breaking the record for the largest Friday opening (31 October 2008) in the UK.[132] The film then broke the UK opening-weekend record, taking £15.5 million ($25 million) in its first weekend, surpassing the previous record of £14.9 million held by *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*. It earned a further £14 million in France and Sweden—where it opened on the same day. The weekend gross of the equivalent of $10.6 million in France was a record for the series, surpassing what *Casino Royale* made in five days by 16%. The $2.7 million gross in Sweden was the fourth-highest opening for a film there.[133][134]\n\n\nThe following week, the film was playing in 60 countries. It grossed the equivalent of $39.3 million in the UK, $16.5 million in France and $7.7 million in Germany on 7 November 2008.[135] The film broke records in Switzerland, Finland, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Romania and Slovenia. Its Chinese and Indian openings were the second-largest ever for foreign-language films.[136]\n\n\nThe film grossed $27 million on its opening day in 3,451 cinemas in Canada and the United States, where it was the number one film for the weekend, with $67.5 million and $19,568 average per cinema.[137] It was the highest-grossing opening weekend *Bond* film in the US,[138] and tied with *The Incredibles* for the biggest November opening outside of the *Harry Potter* series. From the British opening on 31 October, through to the US opening weekend on 14 November, the film had grossed a total $319,128,882 worldwide. The film grossed $168.4 million in Canada and the US, and $421.2 million in other territories, for a total of $589.6 million.[4]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 63% based on 301 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Brutal and breathless, *Quantum Of Solace* delivers tender emotions along with frenetic action, but coming on the heels of *Casino Royale*, it's still a bit of a disappointment.\"[139] On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[140] Critics generally preferred *Casino Royale*, but continued to praise Craig's depiction of Bond, and agree that the film is still an enjoyable addition to the series. The action sequences and pacing were praised, but criticism grew over the realism and serious but gritty feeling that the film carried over.[141] The film earned an average grade of \"B−\" from CinemaScore's audience surveys, on an A+ to F scale, the lowest of the Craig's era as Bond.[142]\n\n\nRoger Moore, the third actor to play Bond in the films, said that Craig was a \"damn good Bond but the film as a whole, there was a bit too much flash cutting [and] it was just like a commercial of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what the hell was going on.\"[143] Kim Newman of *Empire* magazine gave it a 4/5 rating, remarking it was not \"bigger and better than *Casino Royale*, [which is] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun.\" However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films.[144] *The Sunday Times* review noted that \"following *Casino Royale* was never going to be easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth—with a yawn\"; the screenplay \"is at times incomprehensible\" and the casting \"is a mess.\" The review concludes that \"Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism.\"[145] *The Guardian* gave the film 3 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he \"made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage\" and calling the film \"a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement\"; it concludes \"*Quantum of Solace* isn't as good as *Casino Royale*: the smart elegance of Daniel Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up.\"[146]\n\n\n*Screen Daily* says, \"Notices will focus—rightly—on Craig's magnetism as the steely, sexy, murderous MI6 agent, but two other factors weigh in and freshen up proceedings: Forster's new technical team, led by cinematographer Roberto Schaefer and production designer Dennis Gassner. And the ongoing shift of M, as played by Judi Dench, to front and centre: the Bond girls fade into insignificance as she becomes his moral counterpoint and theirs is the only real relationship on screen.\" The review continues, \"Bond is, as has been previously noted, practically the Martin Scorsese of the BAFTAs: 22 films later, with grosses probably close to the GDP of one of the small nations it depicts, it's still waiting for that Alexander Korda award. The best *Casino Royale* could achieve was a gong for sound. Will this be the year that changes its fortunes?\"[147] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times*, who praised the previous film, disliked *Quantum of Solace*. He wrote that the plot was mediocre, characters weak, and that Bond lacked his usual personality, despite his praise for Craig's interpretation of the role. Throughout his review, he emphasised that \"James Bond is not an action hero.\"[148] Kate Muir wrote in *The Times* that \"The *Bond* franchise is 50 years old this year, and the scriptless mess of *Quantum of Solace* may be considered its mid-life crisis\", before she went on to praise the film's successor *Skyfall* as a \"resurrection\".[149] Some writers criticised the choice of *Quantum of Solace* as a title. \"Yes, it's a bad title,\" wrote Marni Weisz, the editor of *Famous*, a Canadian film publication distributed in cinemas in that country, in an editorial entitled \"At least it's not *Octopussy*.\"[150]\n\n\nNot all the reviews were as critical. Tim Robey of *The Daily Telegraph*, in a reflective review of the film in 2013, was positive. He praised the film's shorter runtime, claiming that many other *Bond* films run out of steam before the end, and included *Casino Royale* in this category. Describing the film as having a \"rock-solid dramatic idea and the intelligence to run with it\", he gave the film four stars out of five.[151]\n\n\nCraig retrospectively stated that the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike negatively impacted on the production and end result of *Quantum of Solace*,[152][153] During a 2021 interview on *The Empire Film Podcast*, Craig described the film as a \"shit-show\" and referred to it as one of his least favourite performances as Bond.[154]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nThe film was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Visual Effects, Film and Sound Editing at the 2008 Satellite Awards, winning Best Song.[155] It was nominated for Best Action Movie at the 2009 Critics' Choice Awards,[156] and at the Empire Awards, which is voted for by the public, it was shortlisted for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Newcomer, Best Thriller and Best Soundtrack.[157] It was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, while Kurylenko and Dench were both nominated for the Best Supporting Actress award.[158] It was nominated by the Visual Effects Society Awards for \"Outstanding Compositing in a Feature Motion Picture.\"[159]\n\n\nMovie critic Gilbert Cruz listed the film's pre-titles sequence as the eighth-greatest car chase in film history.[160]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Eco-terrorism in fiction\n* Outline of James Bond\n* Cochabamba Water War\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"AFI-Catalog\". *catalog.afi.com*.\n2. **^** \"Quantum of Solace\". *Lumiere*.

Directed by Martin Campbell from a screenplay by Neil Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis, it stars Daniel Craig in his first appearance as Bond, alongside Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Judi Dench, and Jeffrey Wright. In the film, Bond is on assignment to bankrupt terrorist financier Le Chiffre (Mikkelsen) in a high-stakes poker game at the Casino Royale in Montenegro.\n\n\nFollowing *Die Another Day* (2002), Eon decided to reboot the franchise,[6][7] attempting to counteract fun elements of previous entries and instead explore a less experienced, more vulnerable Bond.[8] Casting involved a widespread search for a new actor to succeed Pierce Brosnan as Bond; the choice of Craig, announced in October 2005, proved controversial. Principal photography took place in the Bahamas, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic, with interior sets built at Pinewood Studios and Barrandov Studios. *Casino Royale* features primarily practical stuntwork as opposed to the computer-generated placements seen in other *Bond* films.\n\n\n*Casino Royale* premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 14 November 2006, and was theatrically released first in the United Kingdom on 16 November, and in the United States a day later. The film received critical acclaim, with praise for Craig's reinvention of the character and its departure from the tropes of previous *Bond* films. It grossed over $616 million worldwide, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 2006 and the highest-grossing *James Bond* film until the release of *Skyfall* (2012). The sequel, *Quantum of Solace*, was released in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nMI6 operative James Bond earns his licence to kill and promotion to 00 agent status by assassinating the traitorous Dryden and his contact at the British Embassy in Prague. In Uganda, Mr. White introduces Steven Obanno, a high-ranking member of the Lord's Resistance Army, to Le Chiffre, an Albanian private banker to terrorists. Obanno entrusts Le Chiffre with $100 million to invest. Using knowledge of his own upcoming terrorist attack on aerospace manufacturer Skyfleet, Le Chiffre shorts the company's stock.\n\n\nIn Madagascar, Bond blows up an embassy while capturing and then killing a bomb-maker named Mollaka. MI6 chief M admonishes Bond for causing an international incident and ignoring her orders to take Mollaka alive. Information on Mollaka's phone leads Bond to the Bahamas and a corrupt Greek official, Alex Dimitrios, who had hired Mollaka at Le Chiffre's request to bomb Skyfleet's prototype airliner. After winning Dimitrios's vintage Aston Martin in a poker game and seducing his wife, Solange, Bond pursues Dimitrios to Miami. Bond fends off an attack by Dimitrios and kills him. At the airport, Bond chases down the new bomber Dimitrios has hired and thwarts the destruction of the Skyfleet airliner. With the Skyfleet stock secure, Le Chiffre loses Obanno's money. Surmising that somebody talked about the terrorist plot, Le Chiffre tortures Solange to death.\n\n\nTo recoup his client's money, Le Chiffre organizes a Texas hold 'em tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond—the agency's best poker player—in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the British government in exchange for information on his clients. Bond is paired with Vesper Lynd, a British Treasury agent overseeing the $10 million buy-in. They meet their contact, René Mathis, in Montenegro. Obanno, furious that his money is missing, threatens Le Chiffre, but allows him to continue playing to win back the money. Obanno and his bodyguard attack Bond, who kills them both. Bond loses his $10 million stake after Le Chiffre is tipped off about his own tell, and Vesper refuses to authorize an additional $5 million for Bond to continue. However, fellow player Felix Leiter, a CIA agent, stakes Bond to the money in exchange for letting his agency take Le Chiffre into custody. Le Chiffre's lover, Valenka, poisons Bond's martini, but Vesper rescues him. Bond returns to the game and wins the tournament. Le Chiffre kidnaps Vesper to trap Bond and takes them to an abandoned ship. He tortures Bond to reveal the password to the bank account holding the winnings, but Bond resists. Mr. White bursts in and kills Le Chiffre but inexplicably spares Bond and Vesper.\n\n\nBond awakens in hospital and recovers with Vesper at his side. He has Mathis apprehended after believing that he had tipped off Le Chiffre about his tell. Bond falls in love with Vesper and resigns from MI6. The couple sails to Venice. When M reveals that his winnings were never transferred to the British treasury, Bond realizes that Vesper has betrayed him. He tails her to a hand-off of the money, where gunmen spot him and take her captive inside a Venetian palace undergoing restoration. Bond shoots the building's flotation devices, causing it to gradually sink into the Grand Canal as he picks off the shooters. Vesper is imprisoned in the building's elevator and, after locking herself in to prevent Bond from saving her, drowns. Mr. White, meanwhile, escapes with the money.\n\n\nM informs Bond, who has returned to service, that the organization behind Le Chiffre[n 1] threatened to kill Vesper's lover unless she became a double agent. When Bond angrily denounces Vesper as a traitor, M reasons that she likely made a deal with White by trading the winnings for Bond's life. Realizing Vesper left her phone to help him, Bond checks the contacts and locates Mr. White at an estate in Lake Como. He shoots White in the leg and introduces himself: \"The name's Bond, James Bond\".\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Daniel Craig as James Bond: A British MI6 officer newly assigned 00 status, giving him a licence to kill. He is sent on a mission to arrest a bomb-maker in Madagascar, where he stumbles upon Le Chiffre's terrorist cell and is then sent to defeat him in a high-stakes poker game at Casino Royale.\n* Eva Green as Vesper Lynd: An agent for Her Majesty's Treasury assigned to supervise Bond and finance him in a high-stakes poker game.\n* Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre: A banker who services many of the world's criminals and terrorists and associate partner of SPECTRE, he is a mathematical genius and expert chess player, using these skills when playing poker.\n* Giancarlo Giannini as René Mathis: Bond's contact in Montenegro.\n* Jesper Christensen as Mr. White: A liaison for an unnamed criminal organization (the nature of this group is explored more in the next film, *Quantum of Solace*).\n* Judi Dench as M: The head of MI6. Although she feels she has promoted Bond too soon and chides him for his rash actions, she plays an important maternal figure in his life. Dench was the only cast member retained from the Pierce Brosnan films.\n* Tobias Menzies as Villiers: M's young secretary at MI6 headquarters. His character's last name is a reference to James Villiers, who portrayed Bill Tanner in *For Your Eyes Only*, and to the character of Amherst Villiers in the original novel.[9]\n* Isaach de Bankolé as Steven Obanno: A leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, he is introduced to Le Chiffre by Mr. White to account his finances.\n* Simon Abkarian as Alex Dimitrios: A contractor in the international criminal underworld and associate of Le Chiffre, he is based in the Bahamas.\n* Ivana Miličević as Valenka: Le Chiffre's girlfriend and henchwoman, she accompanies him to the poker game.\n* Caterina Murino as Solange Dimitrios: Dimitrios's wife; Bond seduces her, causing her unintentionally to reveal one of his plans. After Bond kills Dimitrios, she is found tortured and killed.\n* Claudio Santamaria as Carlos: A terrorist employed by Le Chiffre to blow up an aircraft.\n* Sébastien Foucan as Mollaka: A bomb-maker pursued by Bond through a construction site in Madagascar. Credited in opening title cards under \"Free running stunts\".\n* Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter: A CIA operative, he is participating in the poker tournament while assisting Bond. This is the first Eon-produced Bond film in which Leiter is played by a black actor. (Leiter was played by black actor Bernie Casey in *Never Say Never Again*, which was not produced by Eon.)\n\n\n*Casino Royale* includes a cameo by British entrepreneur Richard Branson (seen being TSA-screened at Miami International Airport). The cameo was cut out of the in-flight versions shown on British Airways' in-flight entertainment systems, and the Virgin Atlantic aircraft Branson supplied had its tail fin (bearing the company logo) obscured.[10] Brazilian model Alessandra Ambrosio makes an unspoken cameo as a tennis player.[11]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* had been produced as a 1954 television episode starring Barry Nelson as Bond and Peter Lorre as the villain Le Chiffre, as well as a non-canonical 1967 ensemble satirical film starring David Niven, Peter Sellers and Woody Allen. Eon Productions gained the rights to *Casino Royale* in 1999 after Sony Pictures Entertainment exchanged them for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's rights to *Spider-Man*.[12] In March 2004, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, aiming to bring back the flavour of Ian Fleming's original *Bond* novels.[13] An early draft featured Bond backpacking in Madagascar and playing chess with Lord Lucan.[14] As the drafts became closer to being finalized, the opening scene in which Bond earns his 00 license was originally going to consist of an adaptation of either the short stories \"The Hildebrand Rarity\" or \"007 in New York.\" Rather than bombing the Skyfleet jet, there would have been a hijacking of a cruise ship in Cape Town.[14]\n\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino expressed interest in directing an adaptation of *Casino Royale*,[15] but Eon was not interested. He claims to have worked behind the scenes with the Fleming family, and believed this was the reason why filmmakers finally went ahead with *Casino Royale*.[16] Tarantino also said he would have set it in the 1960s and would have only made it with Pierce Brosnan as Bond. In February 2005, Martin Campbell, who previously directed *GoldenEye* (1995), was announced as the film's director.[17] Campbell felt Purvis and Wade's draft needed a rewrite, and suggested hiring Paul Haggis whose main contribution was to rewrite the climax of the film. Haggis explained, \"the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft, the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why but I thought that Vesper had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her.\"[18] Haggis also said they wanted \"to do for Bond what *Batman Begins* did for Batman.\"[19] Broccoli and Wilson thought that \"*Die Another Day* had become too fantastical\",[20] feeling the next film should be more realistic. Later that same year, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with the film.[21] Broccoli also felt that frivolity didn't feel appropriate after the 9/11 attacks.[22]\n\n\nEon believed that it had relied too heavily on computer-generated imagery effects in the more recent films, particularly *Die Another Day*, and was keen to accomplish the stunts in *Casino Royale* \"the old fashioned way\".[23] In keeping with this drive for more realism, screenwriters Purvis, Wade and Haggis wanted the script to follow as closely as possible the original 1953 novel, keeping Fleming's darker storyline and characterization of Bond.[24]\nDue to copyright issues related to the ownership of *Thunderball*, the organization of which Mr White is a part is not named Spectre.[25]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nPierce Brosnan had signed a deal for four films when he was cast in the role of James Bond. This was fulfilled with the production of *Die Another Day* in 2002 and Brosnan officially announced he was stepping down in February 2004. At one point, producer Michael G. Wilson claimed over 200 names were being considered for his replacement.[26] Croatian actor Goran Višnjić auditioned for the role the same day as Craig, but was reportedly unable to master an English accent.[27] New Zealander Karl Urban was considered, but was unable to make the screen test due to filming commitments.[28] According to Martin Campbell, Henry Cavill was the only other actor in serious contention for the role, but at 22 years old, he was considered too young.[29] Cavill would later say that he was turned down by Campbell as he considered him out of shape for the part.[30] Australian actor Sam Worthington and Scottish actor Dougray Scott were also considered.[31][32] Scottish actor Sam Heughan and Welsh actor Matthew Rhys also auditioned.[33][34][35] Scottish actor David Tennant was reportedly considered, although Tennant himself did not know he was on the shortlist until years later.[36] Campbell and casting directors Janet Hirshenson and Jane Jenkins recalled meeting with Alex O'Loughlin, Julian McMahon, Ewan McGregor, Rupert Friend, and Antony Starr to discuss the role.[37]\n\n\nIn May 2005, British actor Daniel Craig stated that MGM and producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured him he would get the role of Bond. Matthew Vaughn told reporters MGM had offered him the opportunity to direct the new film, but Eon Productions at that point had not approached either of them.[38] A year beforehand, Craig rejected the idea of starring, as he felt the series had descended into formula; only when he read the script did he become interested. Craig read all of Fleming's novels to prepare for the part, and cited Mossad and British Secret Service agents who served as advisers on the set of *Munich* as inspiring because, \"Bond has just come out of the service and he's a killer. [...] You can see it in their eyes, you know immediately: oh, hello, he's a killer. There's a look. These guys walk into a room and very subtly they check the perimeters for an exit. That's the sort of thing I wanted.\"[39]\n\n\nOn 14 October 2005, Eon Productions, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and MGM announced at a press conference in London that Craig would be the sixth actor to portray James Bond. Taking time off from reshoots for *The Invasion*, a business-suit clad, rather long-haired Craig boarded a Royal Marines Rigid Raider from HMS *Belfast* before travelling to HMS *President*, where he was introduced to the world's press.[40][41] Controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as \"danielcraigisnotbond.com\" expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest.[42] Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed.[43] The *Daily Mirror* ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, *The Name's Bland – James Bland*.[44]\n\n\nThe next important casting was that of the lead Bond girl, Vesper Lynd. Casting director Debbie McWilliams acknowledged Hollywood actresses Angelina Jolie and Charlize Theron were \"strongly considered\" for the role. Belgian actress Cécile de France had also auditioned, but her English accent \"wasn't up to scratch.\"[45] French actress Audrey Tautou was also considered, but not chosen because of her role in *The Da Vinci Code*, which was another Columbia Pictures film released in May 2006.[46] Rachel McAdams turned down a role in the film to focus on raising her own family.[47] Olivia Wilde and French actress Eva Green were the two finalists for the part.[48] On 16 February 2006, Green was announced to play the part.[49]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![A man wearing a grey shirt, jeans and sunglasses sits on a boat at sea. Besides him, a man wearing a black shirt, red cap, and sunglasses talks to another, who is mostly off the picture.](image)Craig with Michael G. Wilson in Venice during filming aboard SV *Spirit*\nPrincipal photography for *Casino Royale* commenced on 3 January 2006 and concluded on 20 July 2006. The film was primarily shot at Barrandov Studios in Prague, with additional location shooting in the Bahamas, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The shoot concluded at Pinewood Studios.[50] Michael G. Wilson had stated *Casino Royale* would either be filmed or take place in Prague and South Africa. However, Eon Productions encountered problems in securing film locations in South Africa.[51] After no other locations became available, the producers had to reconsider their options. In September 2005, Martin Campbell and director of photography Phil Méheux were scouting Paradise Island in the Bahamas as a possible location for the film.[52] On 6 October 2005, Martin Campbell confirmed *Casino Royale* would film in the Bahamas and \"maybe Italy\". In addition to the extensive location filming, studio work including choreography and stunt co-ordination practice was performed at the Barrandov Studios in Prague, and at Pinewood Studios, where the film used several stages, the paddock tank, and the 007 Stage. Further shooting in the UK was scheduled for Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, the cricket pavilion at Eton College (although that scene was cut from the completed movie), and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in Bedfordshire.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Grandhotel Pupp, Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic\nAfter Prague, the production moved to the Bahamas. Several locations around New Providence were used for filming during February and March, particularly on Paradise Island. Footage set in Mbale, Uganda, was filmed at Black Park, a country park in Buckinghamshire, on 4 July 2006. Additional scenes took place at Albany House, an estate owned by golfers Ernie Els and Tiger Woods.[53] The crew returned to the Czech Republic in April, and continued there, filming in Prague, Planá, and Loket, before completing in the town of Karlovy Vary in May. Karlovy Vary was used as the exterior of the Casino Royale,[54] with the Grandhotel Pupp serving as \"Hotel Splendide\".[55]\n\n\nThe main Italian location was Venice, where the majority of the film's ending is set. The scene with Bond on a sailboat was filmed aboard a 54-foot (16 m) yacht named *Spirit*. She was constructed by Spirit Yachts in Suffolk, England, and had to be demasted to fit under various Venetian bridges to reach the filming location. For this reason, SV *Spirit* \"was the first sailing boat to go up the Grand Canal in Venice for 300 years\".[56]\n\n\nOther scenes in the latter half of the film were shot in late May and early June at the Villa del Balbianello on the shores of Lake Como.[57] Further exterior shooting for the movie took place at properties such as the Villa La Gaeta, near the lakeside town of Menaggio.[43]\n\n\nA recreation of the Body Worlds exhibit provided a setting for one scene in the film. Among the Body Worlds plastinates featured in that scene were the *Poker Playing Trio* (which plays a key role in one scene) and *Rearing Horse and Rider*. The exhibition's developer and promoter, German anatomist Gunther von Hagens also has a cameo appearance in the film,[58] although only his trademark hat is actually visible on screen.\n\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\nIn designing the credit sequence for the film, graphic designer Daniel Kleinman was inspired by the cover of the 1953 British first edition of *Casino Royale*, which featured Ian Fleming's original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with blood. Kleinman said, \"The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond's love story. So I took that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles,\" like a club representing a puff of gun smoke, and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts.[59] In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitized the footage of Craig and the film's stuntmen on the Inferno visual effects system, at Framestore CFC in London; the actors' silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns. Kleinman decided not to use the female silhouettes commonly seen throughout the Bond title sequences, considering that the women did not fit with both the film's spirit and the storyline following Bond falling in love.[60]\n\n\nFor the rest of the film, Chris Corbould, the special effects and miniature effects supervisor, returned to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects. According to Corbould, \"CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It's the best way to go\".[50] Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the Miami Airport chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the Grand Canal and in Pinewood Studios.[50]\n\n\nThe first scenes shot were ones involving a Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel with which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted in 1977 during the filming of *The Spy Who Loved Me*.[50] In the scene, Bond drives a digger towards the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.[50]\n\n\nThe sequence at Miami International Airport was partly shot at the Dunsfold Aerodrome, in Surrey, which is known from British car show *Top Gear*, with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports.[50] In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden, and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards at the moment of full extension away from the plane.[50]\n\n\nThe Skyfleet S570 aircraft in the film was an ex-British Airways 747-200B G-BDXJ, which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film. The modified aircraft had the outboard engines replaced by external fuel tanks, while the inboard engines were replaced by a mock-up pair of engines on each inboard pylon. The cockpit profile was altered to make the 747 look like a prototype of an advanced airliner.[61]\n\n\nThe sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film,[50] with tank consisting of a Venetian piazza and the interior of an abandoned house being constructed. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated electronics with hydraulic valves that were closely controlled by computer because of the dynamic movement within the system on its two axes. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model, which the effects team had built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model lift within the rig could be immersed in 19 feet (5.8 m) of water, and used banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)Aston Martin DBS driven by Bond in the film\nAt the time of filming, Aston Martin was still in the final phases of designing the DBS. Aston Martin delivered two working 'hero' cars to the film. In addition to the two 'hero' cars, Aston Martin had to prepare, and reinforce to withstand impact, three former development DB9s for use as DBS look-a-like stunt cars for the scene involving the car crash. Also a white prototype DB9 manual was supplied to the film crew so that the stunt drivers had something to practice with.[62] Owing to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450 mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at Millbrook Proving Grounds and Adam Kirley, the stunt driver who performed the stunt, had to use an air cannon located behind the driver's seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a speed exceeding 70 mph (113 km/h), the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the *Guinness Book of Records* on 5 November 2006 as a new world record.[50]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Casino Royale (2006 soundtrack)\n\nThe soundtrack of *Casino Royale*, released by Sony Classical Records on 14 November 2006, featured music composed by veteran composer David Arnold, his fourth soundtrack for the *Bond* film series, while Nicholas Dodd orchestrated and conducted the score. Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on 26 July 2006 Chris Cornell had composed and would perform the title song, \"You Know My Name\".[63] The song's main notes are played throughout the film as a substitute for the James Bond Theme, to represent Bond's youth and inexperience. The classic theme only plays during the end credits to signal the climax of his character arc.[64]\n\n\n\n### Promotional marketers[edit]\n\n\nIn a reported £14 million deal between the film's production and car manufacturer Ford, Ford's 2007 model Mondeo would appear in the film and it being driven by the Bond character.[65] Both Sony and Sony Ericsson also made deals, making prominent appearances of tech products in the film including a Blu-ray player, Vaio laptop, Cyber-shot camera, Walkman NW-HD5 digital music player, and a Sony Ericsson K800i handset.[66]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square, the Odeon West End and the Empire simultaneously in London on 14 November 2006. It marked the 60th Royal Film Performance and benefited the Cinema & Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), whose patron, Queen Elizabeth II, was in attendance with the Duke of Edinburgh. Along with the cast and crew, numerous celebrities and 5,000 paying guests were also in attendance with half the proceeds benefiting the CTBF.[67]\n\n\nOnly two days following the premiere, unlicensed copies appeared for sale in London. \"The rapid appearance of this film on the streets shows the sophistication and organisation behind film piracy in the UK,\" said Kieron Sharp, from the Federation Against Copyright Theft.[68] Infringing copies of the DVD were selling for less than £1.57. Craig himself was offered such a DVD while walking anonymously through the streets of Beijing wearing a hat and glasses to avoid being identified.[69]\n\n\nIn January 2007, *Casino Royale* became the first Bond film ever to be shown in mainland Chinese cinemas. The Chinese version was edited before release, with the reference to the Cold War re-dubbed and new dialogue added during the poker scene explaining the process of Texas hold 'em, as the game is less familiar in China (this addition is reminiscent of dialogue that was added to the 1954 American TV adaptation to explain the rules of baccarat, the game featured in the original book). *Casino Royale* has earned approximately $11.7 million in China since its opening on 30 January on 468 screens,[70] including a record opening weekend collection for a non-Chinese film, with $1.5 million.[71]\n\n\nAfter critics dubbed *Die Another Day* \"Buy Another Day\" because of around 20 product placement deals, Eon limited their promotions for *Casino Royale*. Partners included Ford, Heineken (which Eva Green starred in adverts for), Smirnoff, Omega SA, Virgin Atlantic and Sony Ericsson.[72]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* was simultaneously released on DVD, UMD and Blu-ray on 16 March 2007.[73] In the UK, *Casino Royale* was released on 16 March 2007 on DVD and Blu-ray Disc.[74] The DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases broke sales records: the Region 1 Blu-ray Disc edition became the highest selling high-definition title to date, selling more than 100,000 copies since its release.[75] The region 2 DVD edition achieved the record of fastest selling title for its first-week release. The UK DVD has continued to sell well, with 1,622,852 copies sold since 19 March.[76] A copy of the Blu-ray Disc edition of *Casino Royale* was given out to the first 500,000 PAL PlayStation 3 owners who signed up to the PlayStation Network.[77] The DVD was released in a separate two-disc widescreen and fullscreen editions,[78] both of which includes the official music video for the film, and three documentaries detailing how Daniel Craig was chosen for the role of Bond, the filming, and an expanded version of the *Bond Girls Are Forever* documentary incorporating new interviews with *Casino Royale* cast members.\n\n\nA three-disc edition of *Casino Royale* on DVD was released in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2008, coinciding with the cinema release of the sequel, *Quantum of Solace* (the following week in the United States). As well as features present from the 2007 release, the collector's edition contains an audio commentary, deleted scenes, featurettes and a storyboard-to-film comparison.[79] A two-disc Blu-ray version also followed in late 2008, featuring additional supplementary materials, enhanced interactivity through BD-Live, and the previous version's 5.1 PCM soundtrack was replaced with a similar 5.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.[80]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* was released a third time on Blu-ray in 2012 with DTS audio and deleted scenes, but it had fewer special features than the 2008 edition.[81] It was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on 25 February 2020.[82]\n\n\n\n### Cuts and censorship[edit]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* was censored for its release in the UK, the US, Germany and China.\n\n\nIn Britain, by omitting some of Le Chiffre's sadism and James Bond's reactions in the torture scene, the film received the desired BBFC 12A rating.[83] In the United States, two fight scenes were censored to achieve a PG-13 rating: the fight between Bond and the traitorous MI6 agent's contact Fisher, and the fight between Bond and Obanno in the stairway at the Casino Royale.[84]\n\n\nThe German edit of the film cuts a sequence where the bomb-planter at the airport breaks a man's neck, instead replacing it with an alternative take.[84] The mainland Chinese cut of the film also trims the torture scene and the stairway fight, as well as a shot of Bond cleaning his wound at the hotel, and a boat scene.\n\n\nThe fully uncensored version can be found on the Australian, Dutch, French, Hong Kong, Japanese, and Scandinavian Blu-ray and DVD releases, on UK Blu-ray releases from 2012 onwards (rated 15), and on the 4K UHD Blu-ray release (branded as an unrated \"extended\" cut).\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nUpon its release in the United Kingdom, *Casino Royale* broke series records on both opening day—£1.7 million[85]—and opening weekend—£13,370,969.[86] At the end of its box-office run, the film had grossed £55.4 million, making it the most successful film of the year in the UK,[87] and, as of 2011, the tenth-highest-grossing film of all time in the country.[88]\n\n\nOn its US opening day, *Casino Royale* was on top with $14.7 million; throughout the weekend, it grossed a total of $40.8 million, ranking narrowly second behind *Happy Feet*.[89] However, *Casino Royale* was playing in 370 fewer cinemas and had a better average ($11,890 per cinema, against $10,918 for *Happy Feet*).[90] It earned $167.4 million by the end of its run in North America,[5] becoming the highest-grossing film of the series, before being surpassed by *Quantum of Solace*'s $168.4 million.[91]\n\n\nOn 18 November 2006, *Casino Royale* opened at the first position in 27 countries, with a weekend gross of $43.4 million in the non-UK, Irish, US and Canada markets.[92] The film retained the top spot at the worldwide box office for four weeks.[93] The film earned $167.4 million in the United States and Canada and $426.8 million from international territories, for a worldwide total of $594.2 million worldwide. It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2006.[5] It was the highest-grossing instalment of the *James Bond* series until *Skyfall* surpassed it in November 2012.[94] After subsequent re-releases, it has earned $616 million.[5]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 94% based on 263 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"*Casino Royale* disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent James Bond outings, and Daniel Craig delivers what fans and critics have been waiting for: a caustic, haunted, intense reinvention of 007.\"[95] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[96] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[97]\n\n\nCraig's performance and credibility were particularly praised. During production, Craig had been subject to debate by the media and the public, as he did not appear to fit Ian Fleming's original portrait of the character as tall, dark and suave.[98] *The Daily Telegraph* compared the quality of Craig's characterization of Bond to Sean Connery's and praised the script as smartly written, noting how the film departed from the series' conventions. *The Times* compared Craig's portrayal of the character to that of Timothy Dalton, and praised the action as \"edgy\",[99] with another reviewer citing in particular the action sequence involving the cranes in Madagascar.[100] Critics Paul Arendt of BBC Films,[101] Kim Newman of *Empire*,[102] and Todd McCarthy of *Variety*[103] all described Craig as the first actor to truly embody Ian Fleming's James Bond from the original novel: ironic, brutal and cold. Arendt commented, \"Craig is the first actor to really nail 007's defining characteristic: he's an absolute swine\".[101]\n\n\nThe film was similarly well received in North America. MSNBC gave the movie a perfect 5 star rating.[104] The film was described as taking James Bond \"back to his roots\", similar to *From Russia with Love*,[105] where the focus was on character and plot rather than the high-tech gadgets and visual effects that were strongly criticized in *Die Another Day*.[103] *Entertainment Weekly* named the film as the fifth best of the series,[106] and chose Vesper Lynd as the fourth best Bond girl in the series.[107] Some newspaper columnists and critics were impressed enough by Craig's performance to consider him a viable candidate for an Academy Award nomination.[108][109][110]\n\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film a four out of four star rating, and wrote that \"Craig makes a superb Bond ... who gives the sense of a hard man, wounded by life and his job, who nevertheless cares about people and right and wrong,\" and that the film \"has the answers to all my complaints about the 45-year-old James Bond series,\" specifically \"why nobody in a Bond movie ever seems to have any real emotions.\"[111] *Time Out New York*'s Joshua Rothkopf called Craig \"the best Bond in the franchise's history,\" citing the actor's \"crisp, hateful, Mamet-worthy snarl ... This is a screwed-up Bond, a rogue Bond, a bounder, a scrapper and, in the movie's astoundingly bleak coda, an openhearted lover.\"[112]\n\n\nVicky Allan of the *Sunday Herald* noted Bond himself, and not his love interests, was sexually objectified in this film: A moment where he rises from the sea is reminiscent of Ursula Andress in *Dr. No*; he feels \"skewered\" by Vesper Lynd's criticism of him; \"and though it would be almost unthinkable now have a female character in a mainstream film stripped naked and threatened with genital mutilation, that is exactly what happens to Bond in [the film].\" So although the film backed off from past criticism of Bond girls being sex objects, \"the once invincible James Bond becomes just another joint at the meat market.\"[113] This sentiment is shared by the University of Leicester's James Chapman, author of *Licence to Thrill*, who also notes Craig's Bond is \"not yet the polished article\"; he felt his incarnation of Bond is close to Fleming's because he is \"humourless,\" but is also different because \"Fleming's Bond did not enjoy killing; Craig's Bond seems almost to relish it.\"[114] Andrew Sarris of *The New York Observer* wrote that this particular Bond film is \"the very first that I would seriously consider placing on my own yearly 10-best list. Furthermore, I consider Daniel Craig to be the most effective and appealing of the six actors who have played 007, and that includes even Sean Connery.\"[115]\n\n\nRoger Moore wrote, \"Daniel Craig impressed me so greatly in his debut outing, *Casino Royale*, by introducing a more gritty, unrefined edge to the character that I thought Sean [Connery] might just have to move over. Craig's interpretation was like nothing we'd seen on screen before; Jimmy Bond was earning his stripes and making mistakes. It was intriguing to see him being castigated by M, just like a naughty schoolboy would be by his headmaster. The script showed him as a vulnerable, troubled, and flawed character. Quite the opposite to my Bond! Craig was, and is, very much the Bond Ian Fleming had described in the books – a ruthless killing machine. It was a Bond that the public wanted.\" Moore also quipped that his praise was \"not heaped lightly,\" because he had to purchase the DVD himself.[116] Raymond Benson, the author of nine *Bond* novels, called *Casino Royale* \"a perfect *Bond* film.\"[117]\n\n\nThe film met with mixed reactions from other critics. John Beifuss of *The Commercial Appeal* said, \"Who wants to see Bond learn a lesson about ego, as if he were Greg Brady in his 'Johnny Bravo' phase?\"[118] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* criticized the more imperfect and self-aware depiction of the character, saying, \"Even James Bond, in other words, wants to be 007.\"[119]\n\n\nThough American radio personality Michael Medved gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as \"intriguing, audacious and very original ... more believable and less cartoonish, than previous 007 extravaganzas\"; he commented further that the \"sometimes sluggish pacing will frustrate some Bond fanatics.\"[120] Commentators such as Emanuel Levy concurred, feeling the ending was too long, and that the film's terrorist villains lacked depth, although he praised Craig and gave the film a B+ overall.[121] Other reviewers responded negatively, including Tim Adams of *The Observer*, who felt the film came off uncomfortably in an attempt to make the series grittier.[122]\n\n\nIn December 2006, *Casino Royale* was named the best film of the year by viewers of *Film 2006*.[123][124] In 2009, UK ice cream company Del Monte Superfruit Smoothies launched an ice lolly moulded to resemble Craig emerging from the sea.[125][126] In 2008, *Entertainment Weekly* named *Casino Royale* the 19th-best film of the past 25 years.[127]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2006 British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards, *Casino Royale* won the Film Award for Best Sound (Chris Munro, Eddy Joseph, Mike Prestwood Smith, Martin Cantwell, Mark Taylor), and the Orange Rising Star Award, which was won by Eva Green.[128] The film was nominated for eight BAFTA awards, including the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film of the Year; Best Screenplay (Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, Paul Haggis); the Anthony Asquith Award for Best Film Music (David Arnold); Best Cinematography (Phil Méheux); Best Editing (Stuart Baird); Best Production Design (Peter Lamont, Simon Wakefield); Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects (Steve Begg, Chris Corbould, John Paul Docherty, Ditch Doy); and Best Actor (Daniel Craig). This made Craig the first actor ever to receive a BAFTA nomination for a performance as James Bond.[129] He also received the Evening Standard British Film Award for Best Actor.[130]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* won the Excellence in Production Design Award from the Art Directors Guild,[131] and singer Chris Cornell's \"You Know My Name\" won the International Press Academy Satellite Award for Best Original Song.[132] The film was nominated for five Saturn Awards—Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, Best Actor (Daniel Craig), Best Supporting Actress (Eva Green), Best Writing (Purvis, Wade and Haggis) and Best Music (David Arnold).[133] The 2006 Golden Tomato Awards named *Casino Royale* the Wide Release Film of the Year.[134] *Casino Royale* was also nominated for, and has won, many other international awards for its screenplay,[135] film editing,[136] visual effects,[137] and production design.[138] At the 2007 Saturn Awards, the film was declared to be the Best Action/Adventure/Thriller film of 2006.[139] Several members of the crew were also recipients of 2007 Taurus World Stunt Awards, including Gary Powell for Best Stunt Coordination and Ben Cooke, Kai Martin, Marvin Stewart-Campbell and Adam Kirley for Best High Work.[140]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Category\n | Recipients\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| American Cinema Editors Awards | Best Edited Feature Film – Dramatic | Stuart Baird | Nominated\n |\n| Art Directors Guild Awards | Excellence in Production Design for a Contemporary Film | Peter Lamont | Won\n |\n| British Academy Film Awards | Best Actor in a Leading Role | Daniel Craig | Nominated\n |\n| Best Adapted Screenplay | Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis | Nominated\n |\n| Best Cinematography | Phil Méheux | Nominated\n |\n| Best Editing | Stuart Baird | Nominated\n |\n| Best Original Music | David Arnold | Nominated\n |\n| Best Production Design | Peter Lamont, Lee Sandales and Simon Wakefield\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Sound | Chris Munro, Eddy Joseph, Mike Prestwood Smith, Martin Cantwell and Mark Taylor | Won\n |\n| Best Special Visual Effects | Steve Begg, Chris Corbould, John Paul Docherty and Ditch Doy\n | Nominated\n |\n| Outstanding British Film | Michael G.

Directed by Martin Campbell from a screenplay by Neil Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis, it stars Daniel Craig in his first appearance as Bond, alongside Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Judi Dench, and Jeffrey Wright. In the film, Bond is on assignment to bankrupt terrorist financier Le Chiffre (Mikkelsen) in a high-stakes poker game at the Casino Royale in Montenegro.\n\n\nFollowing *Die Another Day* (2002), Eon decided to reboot the franchise,[6][7] attempting to counteract fun elements of previous entries and instead explore a less experienced, more vulnerable Bond.[8] Casting involved a widespread search for a new actor to succeed Pierce Brosnan as Bond; the choice of Craig, announced in October 2005, proved controversial. Principal photography took place in the Bahamas, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic, with interior sets built at Pinewood Studios and Barrandov Studios. *Casino Royale* features primarily practical stuntwork as opposed to the computer-generated placements seen in other *Bond* films.\n\n\n*Casino Royale* premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 14 November 2006, and was theatrically released first in the United Kingdom on 16 November, and in the United States a day later. The film received critical acclaim, with praise for Craig's reinvention of the character and its departure from the tropes of previous *Bond* films. It grossed over $616 million worldwide, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 2006 and the highest-grossing *James Bond* film until the release of *Skyfall* (2012). The sequel, *Quantum of Solace*, was released in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nMI6 operative James Bond earns his licence to kill and promotion to 00 agent status by assassinating the traitorous Dryden and his contact at the British Embassy in Prague. In Uganda, Mr. White introduces Steven Obanno, a high-ranking member of the Lord's Resistance Army, to Le Chiffre, an Albanian private banker to terrorists. Obanno entrusts Le Chiffre with $100 million to invest. Using knowledge of his own upcoming terrorist attack on aerospace manufacturer Skyfleet, Le Chiffre shorts the company's stock.\n\n\nIn Madagascar, Bond blows up an embassy while capturing and then killing a bomb-maker named Mollaka. MI6 chief M admonishes Bond for causing an international incident and ignoring her orders to take Mollaka alive. Information on Mollaka's phone leads Bond to the Bahamas and a corrupt Greek official, Alex Dimitrios, who had hired Mollaka at Le Chiffre's request to bomb Skyfleet's prototype airliner. After winning Dimitrios's vintage Aston Martin in a poker game and seducing his wife, Solange, Bond pursues Dimitrios to Miami. Bond fends off an attack by Dimitrios and kills him. At the airport, Bond chases down the new bomber Dimitrios has hired and thwarts the destruction of the Skyfleet airliner. With the Skyfleet stock secure, Le Chiffre loses Obanno's money. Surmising that somebody talked about the terrorist plot, Le Chiffre tortures Solange to death.\n\n\nTo recoup his client's money, Le Chiffre organizes a Texas hold 'em tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond—the agency's best poker player—in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the British government in exchange for information on his clients. Bond is paired with Vesper Lynd, a British Treasury agent overseeing the $10 million buy-in. They meet their contact, René Mathis, in Montenegro. Obanno, furious that his money is missing, threatens Le Chiffre, but allows him to continue playing to win back the money. Obanno and his bodyguard attack Bond, who kills them both. Bond loses his $10 million stake after Le Chiffre is tipped off about his own tell, and Vesper refuses to authorize an additional $5 million for Bond to continue. However, fellow player Felix Leiter, a CIA agent, stakes Bond to the money in exchange for letting his agency take Le Chiffre into custody. Le Chiffre's lover, Valenka, poisons Bond's martini, but Vesper rescues him. Bond returns to the game and wins the tournament. Le Chiffre kidnaps Vesper to trap Bond and takes them to an abandoned ship. He tortures Bond to reveal the password to the bank account holding the winnings, but Bond resists. Mr. White bursts in and kills Le Chiffre but inexplicably spares Bond and Vesper.\n\n\nBond awakens in hospital and recovers with Vesper at his side. He has Mathis apprehended after believing that he had tipped off Le Chiffre about his tell. Bond falls in love with Vesper and resigns from MI6. The couple sails to Venice. When M reveals that his winnings were never transferred to the British treasury, Bond realizes that Vesper has betrayed him. He tails her to a hand-off of the money, where gunmen spot him and take her captive inside a Venetian palace undergoing restoration. Bond shoots the building's flotation devices, causing it to gradually sink into the Grand Canal as he picks off the shooters. Vesper is imprisoned in the building's elevator and, after locking herself in to prevent Bond from saving her, drowns. Mr. White, meanwhile, escapes with the money.\n\n\nM informs Bond, who has returned to service, that the organization behind Le Chiffre[n 1] threatened to kill Vesper's lover unless she became a double agent. When Bond angrily denounces Vesper as a traitor, M reasons that she likely made a deal with White by trading the winnings for Bond's life. Realizing Vesper left her phone to help him, Bond checks the contacts and locates Mr. White at an estate in Lake Como. He shoots White in the leg and introduces himself: \"The name's Bond, James Bond\".\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Daniel Craig as James Bond: A British MI6 officer newly assigned 00 status, giving him a licence to kill. He is sent on a mission to arrest a bomb-maker in Madagascar, where he stumbles upon Le Chiffre's terrorist cell and is then sent to defeat him in a high-stakes poker game at Casino Royale.\n* Eva Green as Vesper Lynd: An agent for Her Majesty's Treasury assigned to supervise Bond and finance him in a high-stakes poker game.\n* Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre: A banker who services many of the world's criminals and terrorists and associate partner of SPECTRE, he is a mathematical genius and expert chess player, using these skills when playing poker.\n* Giancarlo Giannini as René Mathis: Bond's contact in Montenegro.\n* Jesper Christensen as Mr. White: A liaison for an unnamed criminal organization (the nature of this group is explored more in the next film, *Quantum of Solace*).\n* Judi Dench as M: The head of MI6. Although she feels she has promoted Bond too soon and chides him for his rash actions, she plays an important maternal figure in his life. Dench was the only cast member retained from the Pierce Brosnan films.\n* Tobias Menzies as Villiers: M's young secretary at MI6 headquarters. His character's last name is a reference to James Villiers, who portrayed Bill Tanner in *For Your Eyes Only*, and to the character of Amherst Villiers in the original novel.[9]\n* Isaach de Bankolé as Steven Obanno: A leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, he is introduced to Le Chiffre by Mr. White to account his finances.\n* Simon Abkarian as Alex Dimitrios: A contractor in the international criminal underworld and associate of Le Chiffre, he is based in the Bahamas.\n* Ivana Miličević as Valenka: Le Chiffre's girlfriend and henchwoman, she accompanies him to the poker game.\n* Caterina Murino as Solange Dimitrios: Dimitrios's wife; Bond seduces her, causing her unintentionally to reveal one of his plans. After Bond kills Dimitrios, she is found tortured and killed.\n* Claudio Santamaria as Carlos: A terrorist employed by Le Chiffre to blow up an aircraft.\n* Sébastien Foucan as Mollaka: A bomb-maker pursued by Bond through a construction site in Madagascar. Credited in opening title cards under \"Free running stunts\".\n* Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter: A CIA operative, he is participating in the poker tournament while assisting Bond. This is the first Eon-produced Bond film in which Leiter is played by a black actor. (Leiter was played by black actor Bernie Casey in *Never Say Never Again*, which was not produced by Eon.)\n\n\n*Casino Royale* includes a cameo by British entrepreneur Richard Branson (seen being TSA-screened at Miami International Airport). The cameo was cut out of the in-flight versions shown on British Airways' in-flight entertainment systems, and the Virgin Atlantic aircraft Branson supplied had its tail fin (bearing the company logo) obscured.[10] Brazilian model Alessandra Ambrosio makes an unspoken cameo as a tennis player.[11]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* had been produced as a 1954 television episode starring Barry Nelson as Bond and Peter Lorre as the villain Le Chiffre, as well as a non-canonical 1967 ensemble satirical film starring David Niven, Peter Sellers and Woody Allen. Eon Productions gained the rights to *Casino Royale* in 1999 after Sony Pictures Entertainment exchanged them for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's rights to *Spider-Man*.[12] In March 2004, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, aiming to bring back the flavour of Ian Fleming's original *Bond* novels.[13] An early draft featured Bond backpacking in Madagascar and playing chess with Lord Lucan.[14] As the drafts became closer to being finalized, the opening scene in which Bond earns his 00 license was originally going to consist of an adaptation of either the short stories \"The Hildebrand Rarity\" or \"007 in New York.\" Rather than bombing the Skyfleet jet, there would have been a hijacking of a cruise ship in Cape Town.[14]\n\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino expressed interest in directing an adaptation of *Casino Royale*,[15] but Eon was not interested. He claims to have worked behind the scenes with the Fleming family, and believed this was the reason why filmmakers finally went ahead with *Casino Royale*.[16] Tarantino also said he would have set it in the 1960s and would have only made it with Pierce Brosnan as Bond. In February 2005, Martin Campbell, who previously directed *GoldenEye* (1995), was announced as the film's director.[17] Campbell felt Purvis and Wade's draft needed a rewrite, and suggested hiring Paul Haggis whose main contribution was to rewrite the climax of the film. Haggis explained, \"the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft, the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why but I thought that Vesper had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her.\"[18] Haggis also said they wanted \"to do for Bond what *Batman Begins* did for Batman.\"[19] Broccoli and Wilson thought that \"*Die Another Day* had become too fantastical\",[20] feeling the next film should be more realistic. Later that same year, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with the film.[21] Broccoli also felt that frivolity didn't feel appropriate after the 9/11 attacks.[22]\n\n\nEon believed that it had relied too heavily on computer-generated imagery effects in the more recent films, particularly *Die Another Day*, and was keen to accomplish the stunts in *Casino Royale* \"the old fashioned way\".[23] In keeping with this drive for more realism, screenwriters Purvis, Wade and Haggis wanted the script to follow as closely as possible the original 1953 novel, keeping Fleming's darker storyline and characterization of Bond.[24]\nDue to copyright issues related to the ownership of *Thunderball*, the organization of which Mr White is a part is not named Spectre.[25]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nPierce Brosnan had signed a deal for four films when he was cast in the role of James Bond. This was fulfilled with the production of *Die Another Day* in 2002 and Brosnan officially announced he was stepping down in February 2004. At one point, producer Michael G. Wilson claimed over 200 names were being considered for his replacement.[26] Croatian actor Goran Višnjić auditioned for the role the same day as Craig, but was reportedly unable to master an English accent.[27] New Zealander Karl Urban was considered, but was unable to make the screen test due to filming commitments.[28] According to Martin Campbell, Henry Cavill was the only other actor in serious contention for the role, but at 22 years old, he was considered too young.[29] Cavill would later say that he was turned down by Campbell as he considered him out of shape for the part.[30] Australian actor Sam Worthington and Scottish actor Dougray Scott were also considered.[31][32] Scottish actor Sam Heughan and Welsh actor Matthew Rhys also auditioned.[33][34][35] Scottish actor David Tennant was reportedly considered, although Tennant himself did not know he was on the shortlist until years later.[36] Campbell and casting directors Janet Hirshenson and Jane Jenkins recalled meeting with Alex O'Loughlin, Julian McMahon, Ewan McGregor, Rupert Friend, and Antony Starr to discuss the role.[37]\n\n\nIn May 2005, British actor Daniel Craig stated that MGM and producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured him he would get the role of Bond. Matthew Vaughn told reporters MGM had offered him the opportunity to direct the new film, but Eon Productions at that point had not approached either of them.[38] A year beforehand, Craig rejected the idea of starring, as he felt the series had descended into formula; only when he read the script did he become interested. Craig read all of Fleming's novels to prepare for the part, and cited Mossad and British Secret Service agents who served as advisers on the set of *Munich* as inspiring because, \"Bond has just come out of the service and he's a killer. [...] You can see it in their eyes, you know immediately: oh, hello, he's a killer. There's a look. These guys walk into a room and very subtly they check the perimeters for an exit. That's the sort of thing I wanted.\"[39]\n\n\nOn 14 October 2005, Eon Productions, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and MGM announced at a press conference in London that Craig would be the sixth actor to portray James Bond. Taking time off from reshoots for *The Invasion*, a business-suit clad, rather long-haired Craig boarded a Royal Marines Rigid Raider from HMS *Belfast* before travelling to HMS *President*, where he was introduced to the world's press.[40][41] Controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as \"danielcraigisnotbond.com\" expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest.[42] Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed.[43] The *Daily Mirror* ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, *The Name's Bland – James Bland*.[44]\n\n\nThe next important casting was that of the lead Bond girl, Vesper Lynd. Casting director Debbie McWilliams acknowledged Hollywood actresses Angelina Jolie and Charlize Theron were \"strongly considered\" for the role. Belgian actress Cécile de France had also auditioned, but her English accent \"wasn't up to scratch.\"[45] French actress Audrey Tautou was also considered, but not chosen because of her role in *The Da Vinci Code*, which was another Columbia Pictures film released in May 2006.[46] Rachel McAdams turned down a role in the film to focus on raising her own family.[47] Olivia Wilde and French actress Eva Green were the two finalists for the part.[48] On 16 February 2006, Green was announced to play the part.[49]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![A man wearing a grey shirt, jeans and sunglasses sits on a boat at sea. Besides him, a man wearing a black shirt, red cap, and sunglasses talks to another, who is mostly off the picture.](image)Craig with Michael G. Wilson in Venice during filming aboard SV *Spirit*\nPrincipal photography for *Casino Royale* commenced on 3 January 2006 and concluded on 20 July 2006. The film was primarily shot at Barrandov Studios in Prague, with additional location shooting in the Bahamas, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The shoot concluded at Pinewood Studios.[50] Michael G. Wilson had stated *Casino Royale* would either be filmed or take place in Prague and South Africa. However, Eon Productions encountered problems in securing film locations in South Africa.[51] After no other locations became available, the producers had to reconsider their options. In September 2005, Martin Campbell and director of photography Phil Méheux were scouting Paradise Island in the Bahamas as a possible location for the film.[52] On 6 October 2005, Martin Campbell confirmed *Casino Royale* would film in the Bahamas and \"maybe Italy\". In addition to the extensive location filming, studio work including choreography and stunt co-ordination practice was performed at the Barrandov Studios in Prague, and at Pinewood Studios, where the film used several stages, the paddock tank, and the 007 Stage. Further shooting in the UK was scheduled for Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, the cricket pavilion at Eton College (although that scene was cut from the completed movie), and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in Bedfordshire.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Grandhotel Pupp, Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic\nAfter Prague, the production moved to the Bahamas. Several locations around New Providence were used for filming during February and March, particularly on Paradise Island. Footage set in Mbale, Uganda, was filmed at Black Park, a country park in Buckinghamshire, on 4 July 2006. Additional scenes took place at Albany House, an estate owned by golfers Ernie Els and Tiger Woods.[53] The crew returned to the Czech Republic in April, and continued there, filming in Prague, Planá, and Loket, before completing in the town of Karlovy Vary in May. Karlovy Vary was used as the exterior of the Casino Royale,[54] with the Grandhotel Pupp serving as \"Hotel Splendide\".[55]\n\n\nThe main Italian location was Venice, where the majority of the film's ending is set. The scene with Bond on a sailboat was filmed aboard a 54-foot (16 m) yacht named *Spirit*. She was constructed by Spirit Yachts in Suffolk, England, and had to be demasted to fit under various Venetian bridges to reach the filming location. For this reason, SV *Spirit* \"was the first sailing boat to go up the Grand Canal in Venice for 300 years\".[56]\n\n\nOther scenes in the latter half of the film were shot in late May and early June at the Villa del Balbianello on the shores of Lake Como.[57] Further exterior shooting for the movie took place at properties such as the Villa La Gaeta, near the lakeside town of Menaggio.[43]\n\n\nA recreation of the Body Worlds exhibit provided a setting for one scene in the film. Among the Body Worlds plastinates featured in that scene were the *Poker Playing Trio* (which plays a key role in one scene) and *Rearing Horse and Rider*. The exhibition's developer and promoter, German anatomist Gunther von Hagens also has a cameo appearance in the film,[58] although only his trademark hat is actually visible on screen.\n\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\nIn designing the credit sequence for the film, graphic designer Daniel Kleinman was inspired by the cover of the 1953 British first edition of *Casino Royale*, which featured Ian Fleming's original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with blood. Kleinman said, \"The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond's love story. So I took that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles,\" like a club representing a puff of gun smoke, and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts.[59] In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitized the footage of Craig and the film's stuntmen on the Inferno visual effects system, at Framestore CFC in London; the actors' silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns. Kleinman decided not to use the female silhouettes commonly seen throughout the Bond title sequences, considering that the women did not fit with both the film's spirit and the storyline following Bond falling in love.[60]\n\n\nFor the rest of the film, Chris Corbould, the special effects and miniature effects supervisor, returned to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects. According to Corbould, \"CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It's the best way to go\".[50] Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the Miami Airport chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the Grand Canal and in Pinewood Studios.[50]\n\n\nThe first scenes shot were ones involving a Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel with which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted in 1977 during the filming of *The Spy Who Loved Me*.[50] In the scene, Bond drives a digger towards the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.[50]\n\n\nThe sequence at Miami International Airport was partly shot at the Dunsfold Aerodrome, in Surrey, which is known from British car show *Top Gear*, with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports.[50] In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden, and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards at the moment of full extension away from the plane.[50]\n\n\nThe Skyfleet S570 aircraft in the film was an ex-British Airways 747-200B G-BDXJ, which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film. The modified aircraft had the outboard engines replaced by external fuel tanks, while the inboard engines were replaced by a mock-up pair of engines on each inboard pylon. The cockpit profile was altered to make the 747 look like a prototype of an advanced airliner.[61]\n\n\nThe sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film,[50] with tank consisting of a Venetian piazza and the interior of an abandoned house being constructed. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated electronics with hydraulic valves that were closely controlled by computer because of the dynamic movement within the system on its two axes. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model, which the effects team had built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model lift within the rig could be immersed in 19 feet (5.8 m) of water, and used banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)Aston Martin DBS driven by Bond in the film\nAt the time of filming, Aston Martin was still in the final phases of designing the DBS. Aston Martin delivered two working 'hero' cars to the film. In addition to the two 'hero' cars, Aston Martin had to prepare, and reinforce to withstand impact, three former development DB9s for use as DBS look-a-like stunt cars for the scene involving the car crash. Also a white prototype DB9 manual was supplied to the film crew so that the stunt drivers had something to practice with.[62] Owing to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450 mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at Millbrook Proving Grounds and Adam Kirley, the stunt driver who performed the stunt, had to use an air cannon located behind the driver's seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a speed exceeding 70 mph (113 km/h), the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the *Guinness Book of Records* on 5 November 2006 as a new world record.[50]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Casino Royale (2006 soundtrack)\n\nThe soundtrack of *Casino Royale*, released by Sony Classical Records on 14 November 2006, featured music composed by veteran composer David Arnold, his fourth soundtrack for the *Bond* film series, while Nicholas Dodd orchestrated and conducted the score. Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on 26 July 2006 Chris Cornell had composed and would perform the title song, \"You Know My Name\".[63] The song's main notes are played throughout the film as a substitute for the James Bond Theme, to represent Bond's youth and inexperience. The classic theme only plays during the end credits to signal the climax of his character arc.[64]\n\n\n\n### Promotional marketers[edit]\n\n\nIn a reported £14 million deal between the film's production and car manufacturer Ford, Ford's 2007 model Mondeo would appear in the film and it being driven by the Bond character.[65] Both Sony and Sony Ericsson also made deals, making prominent appearances of tech products in the film including a Blu-ray player, Vaio laptop, Cyber-shot camera, Walkman NW-HD5 digital music player, and a Sony Ericsson K800i handset.[66]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square, the Odeon West End and the Empire simultaneously in London on 14 November 2006. It marked the 60th Royal Film Performance and benefited the Cinema & Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), whose patron, Queen Elizabeth II, was in attendance with the Duke of Edinburgh. Along with the cast and crew, numerous celebrities and 5,000 paying guests were also in attendance with half the proceeds benefiting the CTBF.[67]\n\n\nOnly two days following the premiere, unlicensed copies appeared for sale in London. \"The rapid appearance of this film on the streets shows the sophistication and organisation behind film piracy in the UK,\" said Kieron Sharp, from the Federation Against Copyright Theft.[68] Infringing copies of the DVD were selling for less than £1.57. Craig himself was offered such a DVD while walking anonymously through the streets of Beijing wearing a hat and glasses to avoid being identified.[69]\n\n\nIn January 2007, *Casino Royale* became the first Bond film ever to be shown in mainland Chinese cinemas. The Chinese version was edited before release, with the reference to the Cold War re-dubbed and new dialogue added during the poker scene explaining the process of Texas hold 'em, as the game is less familiar in China (this addition is reminiscent of dialogue that was added to the 1954 American TV adaptation to explain the rules of baccarat, the game featured in the original book). *Casino Royale* has earned approximately $11.7 million in China since its opening on 30 January on 468 screens,[70] including a record opening weekend collection for a non-Chinese film, with $1.5 million.[71]\n\n\nAfter critics dubbed *Die Another Day* \"Buy Another Day\" because of around 20 product placement deals, Eon limited their promotions for *Casino Royale*. Partners included Ford, Heineken (which Eva Green starred in adverts for), Smirnoff, Omega SA, Virgin Atlantic and Sony Ericsson.[72]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* was simultaneously released on DVD, UMD and Blu-ray on 16 March 2007.[73] In the UK, *Casino Royale* was released on 16 March 2007 on DVD and Blu-ray Disc.[74] The DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases broke sales records: the Region 1 Blu-ray Disc edition became the highest selling high-definition title to date, selling more than 100,000 copies since its release.[75] The region 2 DVD edition achieved the record of fastest selling title for its first-week release. The UK DVD has continued to sell well, with 1,622,852 copies sold since 19 March.[76] A copy of the Blu-ray Disc edition of *Casino Royale* was given out to the first 500,000 PAL PlayStation 3 owners who signed up to the PlayStation Network.[77] The DVD was released in a separate two-disc widescreen and fullscreen editions,[78] both of which includes the official music video for the film, and three documentaries detailing how Daniel Craig was chosen for the role of Bond, the filming, and an expanded version of the *Bond Girls Are Forever* documentary incorporating new interviews with *Casino Royale* cast members.\n\n\nA three-disc edition of *Casino Royale* on DVD was released in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2008, coinciding with the cinema release of the sequel, *Quantum of Solace* (the following week in the United States). As well as features present from the 2007 release, the collector's edition contains an audio commentary, deleted scenes, featurettes and a storyboard-to-film comparison.[79] A two-disc Blu-ray version also followed in late 2008, featuring additional supplementary materials, enhanced interactivity through BD-Live, and the previous version's 5.1 PCM soundtrack was replaced with a similar 5.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.[80]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* was released a third time on Blu-ray in 2012 with DTS audio and deleted scenes, but it had fewer special features than the 2008 edition.[81] It was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on 25 February 2020.[82]\n\n\n\n### Cuts and censorship[edit]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* was censored for its release in the UK, the US, Germany and China.\n\n\nIn Britain, by omitting some of Le Chiffre's sadism and James Bond's reactions in the torture scene, the film received the desired BBFC 12A rating.[83] In the United States, two fight scenes were censored to achieve a PG-13 rating: the fight between Bond and the traitorous MI6 agent's contact Fisher, and the fight between Bond and Obanno in the stairway at the Casino Royale.[84]\n\n\nThe German edit of the film cuts a sequence where the bomb-planter at the airport breaks a man's neck, instead replacing it with an alternative take.[84] The mainland Chinese cut of the film also trims the torture scene and the stairway fight, as well as a shot of Bond cleaning his wound at the hotel, and a boat scene.\n\n\nThe fully uncensored version can be found on the Australian, Dutch, French, Hong Kong, Japanese, and Scandinavian Blu-ray and DVD releases, on UK Blu-ray releases from 2012 onwards (rated 15), and on the 4K UHD Blu-ray release (branded as an unrated \"extended\" cut).\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nUpon its release in the United Kingdom, *Casino Royale* broke series records on both opening day—£1.7 million[85]—and opening weekend—£13,370,969.[86] At the end of its box-office run, the film had grossed £55.4 million, making it the most successful film of the year in the UK,[87] and, as of 2011, the tenth-highest-grossing film of all time in the country.[88]\n\n\nOn its US opening day, *Casino Royale* was on top with $14.7 million; throughout the weekend, it grossed a total of $40.8 million, ranking narrowly second behind *Happy Feet*.[89] However, *Casino Royale* was playing in 370 fewer cinemas and had a better average ($11,890 per cinema, against $10,918 for *Happy Feet*).[90] It earned $167.4 million by the end of its run in North America,[5] becoming the highest-grossing film of the series, before being surpassed by *Quantum of Solace*'s $168.4 million.[91]\n\n\nOn 18 November 2006, *Casino Royale* opened at the first position in 27 countries, with a weekend gross of $43.4 million in the non-UK, Irish, US and Canada markets.[92] The film retained the top spot at the worldwide box office for four weeks.[93] The film earned $167.4 million in the United States and Canada and $426.8 million from international territories, for a worldwide total of $594.2 million worldwide. It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2006.[5] It was the highest-grossing instalment of the *James Bond* series until *Skyfall* surpassed it in November 2012.[94] After subsequent re-releases, it has earned $616 million.[5]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 94% based on 263 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"*Casino Royale* disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent James Bond outings, and Daniel Craig delivers what fans and critics have been waiting for: a caustic, haunted, intense reinvention of 007.\"[95] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[96] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[97]\n\n\nCraig's performance and credibility were particularly praised. During production, Craig had been subject to debate by the media and the public, as he did not appear to fit Ian Fleming's original portrait of the character as tall, dark and suave.[98] *The Daily Telegraph* compared the quality of Craig's characterization of Bond to Sean Connery's and praised the script as smartly written, noting how the film departed from the series' conventions. *The Times* compared Craig's portrayal of the character to that of Timothy Dalton, and praised the action as \"edgy\",[99] with another reviewer citing in particular the action sequence involving the cranes in Madagascar.[100] Critics Paul Arendt of BBC Films,[101] Kim Newman of *Empire*,[102] and Todd McCarthy of *Variety*[103] all described Craig as the first actor to truly embody Ian Fleming's James Bond from the original novel: ironic, brutal and cold. Arendt commented, \"Craig is the first actor to really nail 007's defining characteristic: he's an absolute swine\".[101]\n\n\nThe film was similarly well received in North America. MSNBC gave the movie a perfect 5 star rating.[104] The film was described as taking James Bond \"back to his roots\", similar to *From Russia with Love*,[105] where the focus was on character and plot rather than the high-tech gadgets and visual effects that were strongly criticized in *Die Another Day*.[103] *Entertainment Weekly* named the film as the fifth best of the series,[106] and chose Vesper Lynd as the fourth best Bond girl in the series.[107] Some newspaper columnists and critics were impressed enough by Craig's performance to consider him a viable candidate for an Academy Award nomination.[108][109][110]\n\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film a four out of four star rating, and wrote that \"Craig makes a superb Bond ... who gives the sense of a hard man, wounded by life and his job, who nevertheless cares about people and right and wrong,\" and that the film \"has the answers to all my complaints about the 45-year-old James Bond series,\" specifically \"why nobody in a Bond movie ever seems to have any real emotions.\"[111] *Time Out New York*'s Joshua Rothkopf called Craig \"the best Bond in the franchise's history,\" citing the actor's \"crisp, hateful, Mamet-worthy snarl ... This is a screwed-up Bond, a rogue Bond, a bounder, a scrapper and, in the movie's astoundingly bleak coda, an openhearted lover.\"[112]\n\n\nVicky Allan of the *Sunday Herald* noted Bond himself, and not his love interests, was sexually objectified in this film: A moment where he rises from the sea is reminiscent of Ursula Andress in *Dr. No*; he feels \"skewered\" by Vesper Lynd's criticism of him; \"and though it would be almost unthinkable now have a female character in a mainstream film stripped naked and threatened with genital mutilation, that is exactly what happens to Bond in [the film].\" So although the film backed off from past criticism of Bond girls being sex objects, \"the once invincible James Bond becomes just another joint at the meat market.\"[113] This sentiment is shared by the University of Leicester's James Chapman, author of *Licence to Thrill*, who also notes Craig's Bond is \"not yet the polished article\"; he felt his incarnation of Bond is close to Fleming's because he is \"humourless,\" but is also different because \"Fleming's Bond did not enjoy killing; Craig's Bond seems almost to relish it.\"[114] Andrew Sarris of *The New York Observer* wrote that this particular Bond film is \"the very first that I would seriously consider placing on my own yearly 10-best list. Furthermore, I consider Daniel Craig to be the most effective and appealing of the six actors who have played 007, and that includes even Sean Connery.\"[115]\n\n\nRoger Moore wrote, \"Daniel Craig impressed me so greatly in his debut outing, *Casino Royale*, by introducing a more gritty, unrefined edge to the character that I thought Sean [Connery] might just have to move over. Craig's interpretation was like nothing we'd seen on screen before; Jimmy Bond was earning his stripes and making mistakes. It was intriguing to see him being castigated by M, just like a naughty schoolboy would be by his headmaster. The script showed him as a vulnerable, troubled, and flawed character. Quite the opposite to my Bond! Craig was, and is, very much the Bond Ian Fleming had described in the books – a ruthless killing machine. It was a Bond that the public wanted.\" Moore also quipped that his praise was \"not heaped lightly,\" because he had to purchase the DVD himself.[116] Raymond Benson, the author of nine *Bond* novels, called *Casino Royale* \"a perfect *Bond* film.\"[117]\n\n\nThe film met with mixed reactions from other critics. John Beifuss of *The Commercial Appeal* said, \"Who wants to see Bond learn a lesson about ego, as if he were Greg Brady in his 'Johnny Bravo' phase?\"[118] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* criticized the more imperfect and self-aware depiction of the character, saying, \"Even James Bond, in other words, wants to be 007.\"[119]\n\n\nThough American radio personality Michael Medved gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as \"intriguing, audacious and very original ... more believable and less cartoonish, than previous 007 extravaganzas\"; he commented further that the \"sometimes sluggish pacing will frustrate some Bond fanatics.\"[120] Commentators such as Emanuel Levy concurred, feeling the ending was too long, and that the film's terrorist villains lacked depth, although he praised Craig and gave the film a B+ overall.[121] Other reviewers responded negatively, including Tim Adams of *The Observer*, who felt the film came off uncomfortably in an attempt to make the series grittier.[122]\n\n\nIn December 2006, *Casino Royale* was named the best film of the year by viewers of *Film 2006*.[123][124] In 2009, UK ice cream company Del Monte Superfruit Smoothies launched an ice lolly moulded to resemble Craig emerging from the sea.[125][126] In 2008, *Entertainment Weekly* named *Casino Royale* the 19th-best film of the past 25 years.[127]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2006 British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards, *Casino Royale* won the Film Award for Best Sound (Chris Munro, Eddy Joseph, Mike Prestwood Smith, Martin Cantwell, Mark Taylor), and the Orange Rising Star Award, which was won by Eva Green.[128] The film was nominated for eight BAFTA awards, including the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film of the Year; Best Screenplay (Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, Paul Haggis); the Anthony Asquith Award for Best Film Music (David Arnold); Best Cinematography (Phil Méheux); Best Editing (Stuart Baird); Best Production Design (Peter Lamont, Simon Wakefield); Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects (Steve Begg, Chris Corbould, John Paul Docherty, Ditch Doy); and Best Actor (Daniel Craig). This made Craig the first actor ever to receive a BAFTA nomination for a performance as James Bond.[129] He also received the Evening Standard British Film Award for Best Actor.[130]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* won the Excellence in Production Design Award from the Art Directors Guild,[131] and singer Chris Cornell's \"You Know My Name\" won the International Press Academy Satellite Award for Best Original Song.[132] The film was nominated for five Saturn Awards—Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, Best Actor (Daniel Craig), Best Supporting Actress (Eva Green), Best Writing (Purvis, Wade and Haggis) and Best Music (David Arnold).[133] The 2006 Golden Tomato Awards named *Casino Royale* the Wide Release Film of the Year.[134] *Casino Royale* was also nominated for, and has won, many other international awards for its screenplay,[135] film editing,[136] visual effects,[137] and production design.[138] At the 2007 Saturn Awards, the film was declared to be the Best Action/Adventure/Thriller film of 2006.[139] Several members of the crew were also recipients of 2007 Taurus World Stunt Awards, including Gary Powell for Best Stunt Coordination and Ben Cooke, Kai Martin, Marvin Stewart-Campbell and Adam Kirley for Best High Work.[140]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Category\n | Recipients\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| American Cinema Editors Awards | Best Edited Feature Film – Dramatic | Stuart Baird | Nominated\n |\n| Art Directors Guild Awards | Excellence in Production Design for a Contemporary Film | Peter Lamont | Won\n |\n| British Academy Film Awards | Best Actor in a Leading Role | Daniel Craig | Nominated\n |\n| Best Adapted Screenplay | Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis | Nominated\n |\n| Best Cinematography | Phil Méheux | Nominated\n |\n| Best Editing | Stuart Baird | Nominated\n |\n| Best Original Music | David Arnold | Nominated\n |\n| Best Production Design | Peter Lamont, Lee Sandales and Simon Wakefield\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Sound | Chris Munro, Eddy Joseph, Mike Prestwood Smith, Martin Cantwell and Mark Taylor | Won\n |\n| Best Special Visual Effects | Steve Begg, Chris Corbould, John Paul Docherty and Ditch Doy\n | Nominated\n |\n| Outstanding British Film | Michael G.
