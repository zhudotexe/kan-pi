He defeated the incumbent, Donald Trump, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been \"stolen\" from him through \"voter fraud\", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[304] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[305] On November\u00a023, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[306]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n191. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Scherer, Michael (June 11, 2012). \"Mo Joe\". *Time*. pp.\u00a026\u201330.

The campaign launched four years to the day after the start of his 2020 presidential campaign.[513] It was also announced that Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodriguez would serve as campaign manager and Quentin Fulks would be principal deputy campaign manager. Co-chairs include Lisa Blunt Rochester, Jim Clyburn, Chris Coons, Tammy Duckworth, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Gretchen Whitmer.\n\n\nOn the day of his announcement, a Gallup poll found that Biden's approval rating was just 37 percent.[514] Most who were surveyed in the poll said that the economy was their biggest concern.[514] During his campaign, Biden has promoted his economic record by touting the creation of over 13 million jobs, faster pandemic recovery in terms of GDP than other G7 countries, and the longest period of low unemployment in over 50 years.[515][516]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n167. **^** Tumulty, Karen (October 29, 2008). \"Hidin' Biden: Reining In a Voluble No. 2\". *Time*.

His presidency ranks among the middle to upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents. However, his personal conduct and allegations of sexual assault have made him the subject of substantial scrutiny. Since leaving office, Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of HIV/AIDS and global warming. In 2009, he was named the United Nations special envoy to Haiti. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clinton founded the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. He has remained active in Democratic Party politics, campaigning for his wife's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Clinton's birthplace home in Hope, Arkansas\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n(\u2190 1992) 1996 United States presidential election (2000 \u2192)\n |\n| --- |\n| Democratic Party | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Convention\nPrimaries\n |\n| Candidates | * **Incumbent nominee: Bill Clinton**\n\t+ campaign\n\t+ positions\n* **Incumbent VP nominee: Al Gore**\n\n\n* **Other candidates:** James D.

In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s.[249] After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point.[250] According to a CBS News/*New York Times* poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68\u00a0percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.[251] Clinton's average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61 percent, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years.[252] Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.[252]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n100. **^** \"U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 103rd Congress\u20141st Session\".

Clinton was physically exhausted at the time, and had an inexperienced staff. His high levels of public support dropped in the first few weeks, as he made a series of mistakes. His first choice for attorney general had not paid her taxes on babysitters and was forced to withdraw. The second appointee also withdrew for the same reason. Clinton had repeatedly promised to encourage gays in the military service, despite what he knew to be the strong opposition of the military leadership. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Polk (1835\u20131839)\n* J.

He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. The Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years in the 1994 elections, but Clinton was still comfortably re-elected president in 1996 against both Republican Bob Dole and Perot\u2014now the Reform Party nominee. Starting in the mid-1990s, he began an ideological evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy, advocating for and signing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, the State Children's Health Insurance Program and financial deregulation measures. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court.
