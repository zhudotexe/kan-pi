The House listing phase began on 1 April 2010 and involved the collection of information about all buildings. Information for National Population Register (NPR) was also collected in the first phase, which will be used to issue a 12-digit unique identification number to all registered Indian residents by Unique Identification Authority of India. The second population enumeration phase was conducted between 9 and 28 February 2011. Census has been conducted in India since 1872 and 2011 marks the first time biometric information was collected. According to the provisional reports released on 31 March 2011, the Indian population increased to 1.21 billion with a decadal growth of 17.70%.[2] Adult literacy rate increased to 74.04% with a decadal growth of 9.21%. The motto of the census was *Our Census, Our Future*.\n\n\nSpread across 28 states[a] and 8 union territories, the census covered 640 districts, 5,924 sub-districts, 7,935 towns and more than 600,000 villages. A total of 2.7 million officials visited households in 7,935 towns and 600,000 villages, classifying the population according to gender, religion, education and occupation.[3] The cost of the exercise was approximately \u20b92,200 crore (US$260\u00a0million)[4] \u2013 this comes to less than US$0.50 per person, well below the estimated world average of US$4.60 per person.[3] Conducted every 10 years, this census faced big challenges considering India's vast area and diversity of cultures and opposition from the manpower involved.\n\n\nInformation on castes was included in the census following demands from several ruling coalition leaders including Lalu Prasad Yadav, and Mulayam Singh Yadav supported by opposition parties Bharatiya Janata Party, Shiromani Akali Dal, Shiv Sena and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.[5] Information on caste was last collected during the British Raj in 1931. During the early census, people often exaggerated their caste status to garner social status and it is expected that people downgrade it now in the expectation of gaining government benefits.[6] Earlier, There was speculation that there would be a caste-based census conducted in 2011, the first time for 80 years (last was in 1931), to find the exact population of the \"Other Backward Classes\" (OBCs) in India.[7][8][9][10] This was later accepted and the Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011 was conducted whose first findings were revealed on 3 July 2015 by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.[11] Mandal Commission report of 1980 quoted OBC population at 52%, though National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) survey of 2006 quoted OBC population at 41%.[12]\n\n\nThere is only one instance of a caste count in post-independence India. It was conducted in Kerala in 1968 by the Government of Kerala under E. M. S. Namboodiripad to assess the social and economic backwardness of various lower castes. The census was termed Socio-Economic Survey of 1968 and the results were published in the Gazetteer of Kerala, 1971.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nC. Chandramouli IAS was the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India for the 2011 Indian census. Census data was collected in 16 languages and the training manual was prepared in 18 languages. In 2011, India and Bangladesh also conducted their first-ever joint census of areas along their border.[14][15] The census was conducted in two phases. The first, the house-listing phase, began on 1 April 2010 and involved collection of data about all the buildings and census houses.[16] Information for the National Population Register was also collected in the first phase. The second, the population enumeration phase, was conducted from 9 \u2013 28 February 2011 all over the country. The eradication of epidemics, the availability of more effective medicines for the treatment of various types of diseases and the improvement in the standard of living were the main reasons for the high decadal growth of population in India.\n\n\n\n## Information[edit]\n\n\n### House-listings[edit]\n\n\nThe House-listing schedule contained 35 questions.[17]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1.

India, with 2.4% of the world's surface area, accounts for 17.5% of its population. Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state with roughly 200 million people. Over half the population resided in the six most populous states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.[*citation needed*] Of the 1.21 billion Indians, 833 million (68.84%) live in rural areas while 377 million stay in urban areas.[32][33] 453.6 million people in India are migrants, which is 37.8% of total population.[34][35][36]\n\n\nIndia is home to many religions such as Hinduism, Islam, Christian, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism, while also being home to several indigenous faiths and tribal religions which have been practiced alongside major religions for centuries. According to the 2011 census, the total number of households in India is 248.8 million. Of which 202.4 million are Hindu, 31.2 million are Muslim, 6.3 million are Christian, 4.1 million are Sikh, and 1.9 million are Jain[37][38] According to 2011 census, there are around 3.01 million places of worship in India.[39]\n\n\nEver since its inception, the census of India has been collecting and publishing information about the religious affiliations as expressed by the people of India. In fact, population census has the rare distinction of being the only instrument that collects this diverse and important characteristic of the Indian population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation distribution

India occupies 2.4% of the world's area and is home to 17.5% of the world's population.[2] The Indo-Gangetic Plain has one of the world's biggest stretches of fertile flat-deep alluvium and are among the most densely populated areas of the world. The eastern and western coastal regions of Deccan Plateau are also densely populated regions of India. The Thar Desert in western Rajasthan is one of the most densely populated deserts in the world.[3] The northern and north-eastern states along the Himalayas contain cold arid deserts with fertile valleys. These states have relatively less population density due to indomitable physical barriers.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Census of India[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2001 India population density map\nThe first population census in British India was conducted in 1872. Since India's independence in 1947, a census has been conducted every 10 years, the first occurring in 1951.[5] The census in India is conducted by the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner under the Ministry of Home Affairs, and is one of the largest administrative tasks conducted by a federal government.[6]\n\n\nThe latest population figures are based on data from the 2011 census of India.[7] During the decade of 2001\u20132011, India's annual population growth rate has slowed down from 2.15 percent to 1.76 percent.[7] Based on decennial census data, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu has the fastest growth rate of 55.1\u00a0percent, followed by Meghalaya (27.8\u00a0percent) and Arunachal Pradesh (25.9\u00a0percent). Nagaland recorded the lowest growth rate of -0.5\u00a0percent.[8]\n\n\nIndia has 641,000 inhabited villages and 72.2\u00a0percent of the total population reside in these rural areas.[8] Of them 145,000 villages have population size of 500\u2013999 persons; 130,000\u00a0villages have population size of 1000\u20131999 and 128,000\u00a0villages have population size of 200\u2013499. There are 3,961\u00a0villages that have a population of 10,000\u00a0persons or more.[9] India's 27.8\u00a0percent urban population lives in more than 5,100\u00a0towns and over 380\u00a0urban agglomerations.[10] In the decade of 1991\u20132001, migration to major cities caused rapid increase in urban population.[11][12] On the basis of net migrants by last residence during the past decade, Maharashtra had most immigration with 2.3\u00a0million, followed by National Capital Territory of Delhi (1.7\u00a0million), Gujarat (0.68\u00a0million) and Haryana (0.67\u00a0million). Uttar Pradesh (\u22122.6\u00a0million) and Bihar (\u22121.7\u00a0million) topped the list for interstate emigration.[13] The five states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh account for almost half (47.90 percent) of the total Indian population.[7]\n\n\nWhile the national average for the sex ratio shows an increase from 933 in 2001 to 940 in 2011,[7] the 2011 census shows a sharp decline in the child sex ratio, the number of females per thousand males in a population between age group 0\u20136 years.[7] States such as Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram and Andaman and Nicobar Islands recorded an increase in India's child sex ratio.[7] The national child sex ratio has declined from 927 in 2001 to 914 in 2011.[7] Telangana census was separated from Andhra Pradesh state census figures, after Telangana was officially formed on 2 June 2014.[14]\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\nData from Census 2011 as published by the Registrar General & Census Commissioner,[15] Government of Telangana,[16] and then Planning Commission.[17]\n\n\n(Population density is rounded to the nearest integer)\n\n\n\n\n\n| List of states and union
