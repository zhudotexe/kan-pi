You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThis page provides **lists of best-selling books and book series** to date and in any language. *\"Best-selling\"* refers to the estimated number of copies sold of each book, rather than the number of books printed or currently owned. Comics and textbooks are not included in this list. The books are listed according to the highest sales estimate as reported in reliable, independent sources.\n\n\nAccording to *Guinness World Records* as of 1995, the Bible is the best selling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed.[1] Sales estimates for other printed religious texts include at least 800 million copies for the Qur'an and 190 million copies for the Book of Mormon.[2] Also, a single publisher has produced more than 140 million copies of the Bhagavad Gita. The total number could be much higher.[3] Among non-religious texts, the *Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung*, also known as the *Little Red Book*, has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures—with estimates ranging from 800 million[1] to over 6.5 billion printed volumes.[4] Some claim the distribution ran into the \"billions\"[5] and some cite \"over a billion\" official volumes between 1966 and 1969 alone as well as \"untold numbers of unofficial local reprints and unofficial translations\".[6][7] Exact print figures for these and other books may also be missing or unreliable since these kinds of books may be produced by many different and unrelated publishers, in some cases over many centuries. All books of a religious, ideological, philosophical or political nature have thus been excluded from the lists of best-selling books below for these reasons.\n\n\nMany books lack comprehensive sales figures as book selling and reselling figures prior to the introduction of point of sale equipment was based on the estimates of book sellers, publishers or the authors themselves. For example, *The Lord of the Rings* as one text was recorded to have sold only 967,466 copies in the UK by 2009, but at the same time the author's estate claimed global sales figures of in excess of 150 million.[8] As such accurate figures are only available from the 1990s and in western nations such as US, UK and Australia. Further, e-books have not been included as out of copyright texts are often available freely in this format. Examples of books with reported high sales include *The Count of Monte Cristo* by Alexandre Dumas,[9] *Don Quixote* by Miguel de Cervantes,[10] *Journey to the West* by Wu Cheng'en[11] and *The Lord of the Rings*[12] (which has been sold as both a three volume series, *The Fellowship of the Ring*, *The Two Towers*, and *The Return of the King*, and as a single combined volume) by J. R. R. Tolkien. Hence, in cases where there is too much uncertainty, they are excluded from the list.\n\n\nHaving sold more than 600 million copies worldwide*,[13] Harry Potter* by J. K. Rowling is the best-selling book series in history. The first novel in the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, has sold in excess of 120 million copies,[14] making it one of the best-selling books of all time. As of June 2017, the series has been translated into 85 languages,[15] placing *Harry Potter* among history's most translated literary works. The last four books in the series consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books of all time, and the final installment, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, sold roughly fifteen million copies worldwide within twenty-four hours of its release.[16][17] With twelve million books printed in the first US run, it also holds the record for the highest initial print run for any book in history.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n  Nonfiction\n\n\n\n## List of best-selling individual books[edit]\n\n\n### More than 100 million copies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Book | Author(s) | Original language | First published | Approximate sales\n | Genre\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *A Tale of Two Cities* | Charles Dickens | English | 1859 | >200 million[20][*circular reporting?*] | Historical fiction |\n| *The Little Prince* (*Le Petit Prince*) | Antoine de Saint-Exupéry | French | 1943 | 200 million[21][22] | Fantasy, Children's fiction |\n| *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* | J.

In 2017, a *Times* representative said that the goal is that the lists reflect authentic best sellers.[4] The list has been a source of controversy. When the *Times* believes a book has reached the list in a suspicious way—such as through bulk purchases—the book's entry on the list is marked with a dagger symbol (†).[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External image |\n| --- |\n| ![image icon](image) *New York Times* Best-seller ListOct. 12, 1931\nThe first best-seller list was published with little fanfare for books sold in New York City only. |\n\n\nAlthough the first best seller list in America was published in 1895, in *The Bookman*, a best seller list was not published in *The New York Times* until October 12, 1931, 36 years later, with little fanfare.[6][7] It listed five fiction and four nonfiction books for New York City only.[7] The next month, the list was expanded to eight cities, each with its own list.[7] By the early 1940s, fourteen city-lists were included. A national list was created on April 9, 1942, in the Sunday *New York Times Book Review* as a supplement to the Monday edition regular city lists.[7] The national list was ranked according to how many times the book appeared in the city lists.[7] Eventually the city lists were eliminated, leaving only the national ranking list, which was compiled according to \"reports from leading booksellers in 22 cities\".[7] Ranking by bookseller sales figures continues today, although the process has remained proprietary.[3]\n\n\nBy the 1950s, *The Times*'s list had become the leading best-seller list for book professionals to monitor, along with that of *Publishers Weekly*.[7] In the 1960s and 1970s, shopping-mall chain bookstores B. Dalton, Crown Books, and Waldenbooks came to the forefront with a business model of selling newly published best-sellers with mass-market appeal. They used the best-selling status of titles to market the books and not just as a measure of sales, thus placing increased emphasis on the *New York Times* list for book readers and book sellers.[7]\n\n\nAs shown in the graph below, the number of titles achieving the number one spot has grown consistently over the years, ranging from fewer than 10 in the 1970s to the high thirties in the past decade. This graph represents fiction titles only. Years with smaller numbers means one or more titles dominated as major best sellers, notably *The Da Vinci Code* in 2003 and 2004, *Fifty Shades of Grey* in 2012 and *Where the Crawdads Sing* in 2019.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **NYT Number 1 Fiction Titles per Year** (1970–2022)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\n\n |\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\nThe list is compiled by the editors of the \"News Surveys\" department, not by *The New York Times Book Review* department, where it is published.[9] It is based on weekly sales reports obtained from selected samples of independent and chain bookstores and wholesalers throughout the United States.[9] The sales figures are widely believed to represent books that have actually been sold at retail, rather than wholesale,[10] as the *Times* surveys booksellers in an attempt to better reflect what is purchased by individual buyers. Some books are flagged with a dagger indicating that a significant number of bulk orders had been received by retail bookstores.[11]\n\n\n*The New York Times* reported in 2013 that \"we [generally do not] track the sales of classic literature,\" and thus, for example, new translations of Dante's *Inferno* would not be found on the bestseller list.[12]\n\n\nThe exact method for compiling the data obtained from the booksellers is classified as a trade secret.[3] Book Review staff editor Gregory Cowles explained the method \"is a secret both to protect our product and to make sure people can't try to rig the system. Even in the Book Review itself, we don't know (the news surveys department's) precise methods.\"[9] In 1992, the survey encompassed over 3,000 bookstores as well as \"representative wholesalers with more than 28,000 other retail outlets, including variety stores and supermarkets.\"[3] By 2004, the number was 4,000 bookstores as well as an unstated number of wholesalers.[7] Data is adjusted to give more weight to independent book stores, which are underrepresented in the sample.[7]\n\n\nThe lists are divided among fiction and nonfiction, print and e-book, paperback and hardcover; each list contains 15 to 20 titles. The lists have been subdivided several times. \"Advice, How-To, and Miscellaneous\" debuted as a list of five on January 1, 1984. It was created because advice best-sellers were sometimes crowding the general nonfiction list.[13] Its inaugural number one bestseller, *The Body Principal* by Victoria Principal, had been number 10 and number 12 on the nonfiction lists for the two preceding weeks.[14][15] In July 2000, the \"Children's Best Sellers\" was created after the Harry Potter series had stayed in the top spots on the fiction list for an extended period of time.[16][17] The children's list was printed monthly until February 13, 2011, when it was changed to once an issue (weekly). In September 2007, the paperback fiction list was divided into \"trade\" and \"mass-market\" sections, in order to give more visibility to the trade paperbacks that were more often reviewed by the newspaper itself.[18] In November 2010, *The New York Times* announced it would be tracking e-book best-seller lists in fiction and nonfiction starting in early 2011.[19] \"RoyaltyShare, a San Diego-based company that tracks data and aggregates sales information for publishers, will ... provide [e-book] data\".[19] The two new e-book lists were first published with the February 13, 2011, issue, the first tracks combined print and e-book sales, the second tracks e-book sales only (both lists are further sub-divided into Fiction and Nonfiction). In addition a third new list was published on the web only, which tracks combined print sales (hardcover and paperback) in fiction and nonfiction. On December 16, 2012, the children's chapter books list was divided into two new lists: middle-grade (ages 8–12) and young adult (age 12–18), both which include sales across all platforms (hard, paper and e-book).\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an EPJ Data Science study that used big data to analyze every *New York Times* bestselling book from 2008 to 2016, of the 100,000 new, hardcover print books published each year, fewer than 500 make it on to *The New York Times Best Seller* list (0.5 percent). Most novels (26 percent) appear on the list for only one week. To make the list, it is estimated that novels sell from 1,000 to 10,000 copies per week, depending on competition. Median sales fluctuate between 4,000 and 8,000 in fiction, and 2,000–6,000 in nonfiction. The majority of *New York Times* bestselling books sell from 10,000 to 100,000 copies in their first year.[20][21]\n\n\nDuring the period studied (August 6, 2008, to March 10, 2016), Dan Brown's book *The Lost Symbol* held the record with 3 million copies sold in one year followed by *The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest* by Stieg Larsson and *Go Set a Watchman* by Harper Lee which sold 1.6 million copies each. In nonfiction, more than half of the hardcover books that make the list are in the biography category. The autobiography of George W. Bush, *Decision Points*, sold the most copies in one year followed by the biography *Steve Jobs* by Walter Isaacson.[20]\n\n\n\n## Criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe list has been criticized by authors, publishers, book industry executives, and others for not providing an accurate accounting of true best-seller status. These criticisms have been ongoing ever since the list originated. A book industry report in the 1940s found that best-seller lists were a poor indicator of sales, since they were based on misleading data and were only measuring fast sales. A 2004 report quoted a senior book marketing executive who said the rankings were \"smoke and mirrors\"; while a report in *Book History* found that many professionals in the book industry \"scoffed at the notion that the lists are accurate\".[7]\n\n\nSpecific criticisms include:\n\n\n\n* **Fast sales**.[7][22] A book that never makes the list can actually outsell books on the best-seller list. This is because the best-seller list reflects sales in a given week, not total sales. Thus, one book may sell heavily in a given week, making the list, while another may sell at a slower pace, never making the list, but selling more copies over time.\n* **Double counting**. By including wholesalers in the polls along with retail bookstores, books may be double-counted.[7] Wholesalers report how much they sell to retailers, and retailers report how much they sell to customers, thus there can be overlap with the same reported book being sold twice within a given time frame. In addition, retailers may return books to wholesalers months later if they never sell, thus resulting in a \"sale\" being reported that never came to fruition. For example, mass-market paperbacks can see as high as 40% return rates from the retailer back to the wholesaler.[7]\n* **Manipulation by authors and publishers**. In 1956, author Jean Shepherd created the fake novel *I, Libertine* to illustrate how easy it was to manipulate the best-seller lists based on demand, as well as sales. Fans of Shepherd's radio show planted references to the book and author so widely that demand for the book led to claims of it being on the *Times* list.[23][24] Author Jacqueline Susann (*Valley of the Dolls*) attempted to \"butter-up\" *Times*-reporting booksellers and personally bought large quantities of her own book.[7] Author Wayne Dyer (*Your Erroneous Zones*) purchased thousands of copies of his own book.[7] Al Neuharth (*Confessions of an S. O. B.*), former head of Gannett Company, had his Gannett Foundation buy two thousand copies of his own autobiography.[7] In 1995, authors Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema spent $200,000 to buy ten thousand copies of *The Discipline of Market Leaders* from dozens of bookstores.[7] Although they denied any wrongdoing, the book spent 15 weeks on the list. As a result of this scandal the *Times* began placing a dagger symbol next to any title for which bookstores reported bulk orders.[7] However, daggers do not always appear; for example Tony Hsieh's *Delivering Happiness* was known to have been manipulated with bulk orders but did not have a dagger.[25] Companies that contract with authors to manipulate the bestseller list through \"bestseller campaigns\" include ResultSource.[26]\n* **Manipulation by retailers and wholesalers**.[7] It happens with regularity that wholesalers and retailers deliberately or inadvertently manipulate the sales data they report to the *Times*.[7] Since being on the *Times* best-seller list increases the sales of a book, bookstores and wholesalers may report a book is a best-seller before it actually is one, in order that it might later become a \"legitimate\" best-seller through increased sales due to its inclusion on the best-seller list,[7] leading to the best-seller list becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy for the booksellers.\n* **Leading data collection**. The *Times* provides booksellers with a form containing a list of books it believes might be bestsellers, to check off, with an alternative \"Other\" column to fill in manually.[7] It's been criticized as a leading technique to create a best-seller list based on books the *Times* thinks might be included.[7] One bookseller compared it to a voting card in which two options for president are provided: \"Bill Clinton and Other\".[7]\n* **Self-fulfilling**. Once a book makes it onto the list it is heavily marketed as a \"best-seller\", purchased by readers who seek out best-sellers, given preferential treatment by retailers, online and offline, who create special best-seller categories including special in-store placement and price discounts, and is carried by retailers that generally do not carry other books (e.g., supermarkets).[7] Thus, the list can become self-fulfilling in determining which books have high sales and remain on the list.[7]\n* **Conflicts of interest**. Due to high financial impact of making the list, since the 1970s publishers have created escalator clauses for major authors stipulating that if a book makes the list the author will receive extra money, based on where it ranks and for how long.[7] Authors may also be able to charge higher speaking fees for the status of being a best-seller.[7] As *Book History* said, \"With so much at stake then, it is no wonder that enormous marketing effort goes into getting a book access to this major marketing tool.\"[7]\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn 1983, author William Peter Blatty sued *The New York Times* for $6 million, claiming that his book, *Legion* (filmed as *The Exorcist III*), had not been included in the list due to either negligence or intentional falsehood, saying it should have been included due to high sales. The *Times* countered that the list was not mathematically objective but rather was editorial content and thus protected under the Constitution as free speech. Blatty appealed it to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case. Thus, the lower court ruling stood that the list is editorial content, not objective factual content, so the *Times* had the right to exclude books from the list.[7]\n\n\nIn 1995, Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema, the authors of a book called *The Discipline of Market Leaders*, colluded to manipulate their book onto the best seller charts. The authors allegedly purchased over 10,000 copies of their own book in small and strategically placed orders at bookstores whose sales are reported to BookScan. Because of the benefits of making *The New York Times* Best Seller list (speaking engagements, more book deals, and consulting) the authors felt that buying their own work was an investment that would pay for itself. The book climbed to No. 4 on the list where it sat for 15 weeks; it also peaked at No. 1 on the *BusinessWeek* best seller list. Since such lists hold the power of cumulative advantage, chart success often begets more chart success. Although such efforts are not illegal, publishers consider them unethical.[27]\n\n\nIn 1999, Amazon.com announced a 50% decrease in price for books on the Best Seller List to beat its competition, Barnes & Noble.[28] After a legal dispute between Amazon and *The New York Times*, Amazon was permitted to keep using the list on condition that it displayed it in alphabetical rather than numerical order.[29] By 2010, this was no longer the case; Amazon now displays the best-seller list in order of best-selling titles first.[30]\n\n\nIn 2013, *Forbes* published a story titled \"Here's How You Buy Your Way Onto *The New York Times* Bestsellers List.\"[31] The article discusses how ResultSource, a San Diego-based marketing consultancy, specializes in ensuring books make a bestseller list, even guaranteeing a No. 1 spot for those willing to pay enough. *The New York Times* was informed of this practice and responded: \"*The New York Times* comprehensively tracks and tabulates the weekly unit sales of all titles reported by book retailers as their general interest bestsellers. We will not comment beyond our methodology on the other questions.\" *The New York Times* did not alert its readers to this, unlike *The Wall Street Journal,* which admitted that books had landed on its bestseller list due to ResultSource's campaign.[32] Soren Kaplan, the source who admitted he had paid ResultSource to land his book, *Leapfrogging*, on *The Wall Street Journal*'s bestseller list, revealed the methodology on his blog; he posted: \"If I could obtain bulk orders before *Leapfrogging* was released, ResultSource would purchase the books on my behalf using their tried-and-true formula. Three thousand books sold would get me on *The Wall Street Journal* bestseller list. Eleven thousand would secure a spot on the biggest prize of them all, *The New York Times* list.\"[33]\n\n\nIn 2014, the *Los Angeles Times* published a story titled \"Can bestseller lists be bought?\"[34] It describes how author and pastor Mark Driscoll contracted the company ResultSource to place his book *Real Marriage* (2012) on *The New York Times* Best Seller list for a $200,000 fee. The contract was for ResultSource \"to conduct a bestseller campaign for your book, *Real Marriage* on the week of January 2, 2012. The bestseller campaign is intended to place *Real Marriage* on *The New York Times* bestseller list for the Advice How-to list.\" To achieve this, the contract stated that \"RSI will be purchasing at least 11,000 total orders in one week.\" This took place, and the book successfully reached No.1 on the hardcover advice bestseller list on January 22, 2014.[34]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Ted Cruz's book *A Time For Truth* was excluded from the list because the \"overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales [of Cruz's book] were limited to strategic bulk purchases\" to artificially increase sales and entry onto the list. In response, Cruz called the *Times* \"a liar\" and demanded an apology.[35] The *Times* said it stood by its statement and evidence of manipulation.\n\n\nIn August 2017, a young adult fiction book, *Handbook for Mortals* by previously unpublished author Lani Sarem was removed from the list, where it was in initially in the No. 1 spot. According to a statement issued by the *Times*, \"after investigating the inconsistencies in the most recent reporting cycle, we decided that the sales for *Handbook for Mortals* did not meet our criteria for inclusion. We've issued an updated 'Young Adult Hardcover' list for September 3, 2017 which does not include that title.\"[36] It was uncovered, by author Phil Stamper, that there had been unusual bulk ordering patterns which inflated the number of sales.[37] The book is published by GeekNation, an entertainment website based in Los Angeles.[36] The book was originally written as a script, and was rewritten as a novel in an attempt to launch a film franchise.[38][39]\n\n\nIn August 2017, conservative publisher Regnery Publishing said it would no longer allow its writers to claim to be \"*New York Times* best-selling authors\" due to its belief that the *Times* favors liberal books on the list. The *Times* responded that the political views of authors have no bearing on the list and noted conservative authors routinely rank highly on the list. The Associated Press noted the *Times* is a frequent target of conservatives and Republicans.[40] *The Washington Post* called Regenery's ban a \"stunt\" designed to increase sales, \"What better way to sell a book to a conservative audience than to promote the idea that the *New York Times* doesn't like it?\" The *Post* compared the list to best seller lists from *Publishers Weekly* looking for bias but could not find anything convincing.[41]\n\n\nIn February 2018, the *Toronto Star* published a story by books editor Deborah Dundas who found that the best-selling book *12 Rules for Life* by Jordan Peterson, who topped *Publishers Weekly* chart list, did not even chart on *The New York Times* bestsellers list, without reliable answers from the *New York Times*. The *Times* stated it was not counted because it was published by a Canadian company.[42] According to Random House Canada, the book was handled properly for the U.S. market.[43][44] American conservative commentator Dennis Prager wrote an article for *National Review* titled \"*The Times* Best-Seller List: Another Reason Americans Don't Trust the Media\" in which he contends that the issue with Peterson's book, as well his *The Rational Bible: Exodus*, is their conservative context and the lack of inclusion is the American mainstream media's manipulation.[45] The *Times* denied any bias.[46]\n\n\nIn 2019, the release of Donald Trump Jr.'s book *Triggered* was shown to have only reached the best-seller list through approximately $100,000 in behind-the-scenes bulk purchases meant to pump up its sales numbers illegitimately.[47] *Vanity Fair* reported in October 2020 that this sort of gaming of the system has been a common practice among American conservative political figures, and has also included the use of political campaign funds to purchase the books in bulk in order to boost their rank on the list.[48]\n\n\n\n## Studies[edit]\n\n\nA Stanford Business School analysis suggests that the \"majority of book buyers seem to use the *Times*' list as a signal of what's worth reading\".[49] The study concluded that lesser-known writers get the biggest benefit from being on the list, while perennial best-selling authors, such as John Grisham or Danielle Steel, see no benefit of additional sales.[49]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Books portal\n\n\n* Lists of *The New York Times* number-one books\n* Lists of *The New York Times* Manga Best Sellers\n* Oprah's Book Club\n* *Publishers Weekly* lists of bestselling novels in the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** John Bear, *The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago*, Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992.\n2. **^** Republican Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, while Chairman of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection, said \"the *New York Times* best-seller list is widely considered to be one of the most authoritative lists of which books are selling the most in American bookstores\" during his Opening Statement for Hearing on H.R. 1858 Archived May 2, 2017, at the Wayback Machine on June 15, 1999.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Diamond, Edwin (1995). *Behind the Times: Inside the New* New York Times.

In 2017, a *Times* representative said that the goal is that the lists reflect authentic best sellers.[4] The list has been a source of controversy. When the *Times* believes a book has reached the list in a suspicious way—such as through bulk purchases—the book's entry on the list is marked with a dagger symbol (†).[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External image |\n| --- |\n| ![image icon](image) *New York Times* Best-seller ListOct. 12, 1931\nThe first best-seller list was published with little fanfare for books sold in New York City only. |\n\n\nAlthough the first best seller list in America was published in 1895, in *The Bookman*, a best seller list was not published in *The New York Times* until October 12, 1931, 36 years later, with little fanfare.[6][7] It listed five fiction and four nonfiction books for New York City only.[7] The next month, the list was expanded to eight cities, each with its own list.[7] By the early 1940s, fourteen city-lists were included. A national list was created on April 9, 1942, in the Sunday *New York Times Book Review* as a supplement to the Monday edition regular city lists.[7] The national list was ranked according to how many times the book appeared in the city lists.[7] Eventually the city lists were eliminated, leaving only the national ranking list, which was compiled according to \"reports from leading booksellers in 22 cities\".[7] Ranking by bookseller sales figures continues today, although the process has remained proprietary.[3]\n\n\nBy the 1950s, *The Times*'s list had become the leading best-seller list for book professionals to monitor, along with that of *Publishers Weekly*.[7] In the 1960s and 1970s, shopping-mall chain bookstores B. Dalton, Crown Books, and Waldenbooks came to the forefront with a business model of selling newly published best-sellers with mass-market appeal. They used the best-selling status of titles to market the books and not just as a measure of sales, thus placing increased emphasis on the *New York Times* list for book readers and book sellers.[7]\n\n\nAs shown in the graph below, the number of titles achieving the number one spot has grown consistently over the years, ranging from fewer than 10 in the 1970s to the high thirties in the past decade. This graph represents fiction titles only. Years with smaller numbers means one or more titles dominated as major best sellers, notably *The Da Vinci Code* in 2003 and 2004, *Fifty Shades of Grey* in 2012 and *Where the Crawdads Sing* in 2019.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **NYT Number 1 Fiction Titles per Year** (1970–2022)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\n\n |\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\nThe list is compiled by the editors of the \"News Surveys\" department, not by *The New York Times Book Review* department, where it is published.[9] It is based on weekly sales reports obtained from selected samples of independent and chain bookstores and wholesalers throughout the United States.[9] The sales figures are widely believed to represent books that have actually been sold at retail, rather than wholesale,[10] as the *Times* surveys booksellers in an attempt to better reflect what is purchased by individual buyers. Some books are flagged with a dagger indicating that a significant number of bulk orders had been received by retail bookstores.[11]\n\n\n*The New York Times* reported in 2013 that \"we [generally do not] track the sales of classic literature,\" and thus, for example, new translations of Dante's *Inferno* would not be found on the bestseller list.[12]\n\n\nThe exact method for compiling the data obtained from the booksellers is classified as a trade secret.[3] Book Review staff editor Gregory Cowles explained the method \"is a secret both to protect our product and to make sure people can't try to rig the system. Even in the Book Review itself, we don't know (the news surveys department's) precise methods.\"[9] In 1992, the survey encompassed over 3,000 bookstores as well as \"representative wholesalers with more than 28,000 other retail outlets, including variety stores and supermarkets.\"[3] By 2004, the number was 4,000 bookstores as well as an unstated number of wholesalers.[7] Data is adjusted to give more weight to independent book stores, which are underrepresented in the sample.[7]\n\n\nThe lists are divided among fiction and nonfiction, print and e-book, paperback and hardcover; each list contains 15 to 20 titles. The lists have been subdivided several times. \"Advice, How-To, and Miscellaneous\" debuted as a list of five on January 1, 1984. It was created because advice best-sellers were sometimes crowding the general nonfiction list.[13] Its inaugural number one bestseller, *The Body Principal* by Victoria Principal, had been number 10 and number 12 on the nonfiction lists for the two preceding weeks.[14][15] In July 2000, the \"Children's Best Sellers\" was created after the Harry Potter series had stayed in the top spots on the fiction list for an extended period of time.[16][17] The children's list was printed monthly until February 13, 2011, when it was changed to once an issue (weekly). In September 2007, the paperback fiction list was divided into \"trade\" and \"mass-market\" sections, in order to give more visibility to the trade paperbacks that were more often reviewed by the newspaper itself.[18] In November 2010, *The New York Times* announced it would be tracking e-book best-seller lists in fiction and nonfiction starting in early 2011.[19] \"RoyaltyShare, a San Diego-based company that tracks data and aggregates sales information for publishers, will ... provide [e-book] data\".[19] The two new e-book lists were first published with the February 13, 2011, issue, the first tracks combined print and e-book sales, the second tracks e-book sales only (both lists are further sub-divided into Fiction and Nonfiction). In addition a third new list was published on the web only, which tracks combined print sales (hardcover and paperback) in fiction and nonfiction. On December 16, 2012, the children's chapter books list was divided into two new lists: middle-grade (ages 8–12) and young adult (age 12–18), both which include sales across all platforms (hard, paper and e-book).\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an EPJ Data Science study that used big data to analyze every *New York Times* bestselling book from 2008 to 2016, of the 100,000 new, hardcover print books published each year, fewer than 500 make it on to *The New York Times Best Seller* list (0.5 percent). Most novels (26 percent) appear on the list for only one week. To make the list, it is estimated that novels sell from 1,000 to 10,000 copies per week, depending on competition. Median sales fluctuate between 4,000 and 8,000 in fiction, and 2,000–6,000 in nonfiction. The majority of *New York Times* bestselling books sell from 10,000 to 100,000 copies in their first year.[20][21]\n\n\nDuring the period studied (August 6, 2008, to March 10, 2016), Dan Brown's book *The Lost Symbol* held the record with 3 million copies sold in one year followed by *The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest* by Stieg Larsson and *Go Set a Watchman* by Harper Lee which sold 1.6 million copies each. In nonfiction, more than half of the hardcover books that make the list are in the biography category. The autobiography of George W. Bush, *Decision Points*, sold the most copies in one year followed by the biography *Steve Jobs* by Walter Isaacson.[20]\n\n\n\n## Criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe list has been criticized by authors, publishers, book industry executives, and others for not providing an accurate accounting of true best-seller status. These criticisms have been ongoing ever since the list originated. A book industry report in the 1940s found that best-seller lists were a poor indicator of sales, since they were based on misleading data and were only measuring fast sales. A 2004 report quoted a senior book marketing executive who said the rankings were \"smoke and mirrors\"; while a report in *Book History* found that many professionals in the book industry \"scoffed at the notion that the lists are accurate\".[7]\n\n\nSpecific criticisms include:\n\n\n\n* **Fast sales**.[7][22] A book that never makes the list can actually outsell books on the best-seller list. This is because the best-seller list reflects sales in a given week, not total sales. Thus, one book may sell heavily in a given week, making the list, while another may sell at a slower pace, never making the list, but selling more copies over time.\n* **Double counting**. By including wholesalers in the polls along with retail bookstores, books may be double-counted.[7] Wholesalers report how much they sell to retailers, and retailers report how much they sell to customers, thus there can be overlap with the same reported book being sold twice within a given time frame. In addition, retailers may return books to wholesalers months later if they never sell, thus resulting in a \"sale\" being reported that never came to fruition. For example, mass-market paperbacks can see as high as 40% return rates from the retailer back to the wholesaler.[7]\n* **Manipulation by authors and publishers**. In 1956, author Jean Shepherd created the fake novel *I, Libertine* to illustrate how easy it was to manipulate the best-seller lists based on demand, as well as sales. Fans of Shepherd's radio show planted references to the book and author so widely that demand for the book led to claims of it being on the *Times* list.[23][24] Author Jacqueline Susann (*Valley of the Dolls*) attempted to \"butter-up\" *Times*-reporting booksellers and personally bought large quantities of her own book.[7] Author Wayne Dyer (*Your Erroneous Zones*) purchased thousands of copies of his own book.[7] Al Neuharth (*Confessions of an S. O. B.*), former head of Gannett Company, had his Gannett Foundation buy two thousand copies of his own autobiography.[7] In 1995, authors Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema spent $200,000 to buy ten thousand copies of *The Discipline of Market Leaders* from dozens of bookstores.[7] Although they denied any wrongdoing, the book spent 15 weeks on the list. As a result of this scandal the *Times* began placing a dagger symbol next to any title for which bookstores reported bulk orders.[7] However, daggers do not always appear; for example Tony Hsieh's *Delivering Happiness* was known to have been manipulated with bulk orders but did not have a dagger.[25] Companies that contract with authors to manipulate the bestseller list through \"bestseller campaigns\" include ResultSource.[26]\n* **Manipulation by retailers and wholesalers**.[7] It happens with regularity that wholesalers and retailers deliberately or inadvertently manipulate the sales data they report to the *Times*.[7] Since being on the *Times* best-seller list increases the sales of a book, bookstores and wholesalers may report a book is a best-seller before it actually is one, in order that it might later become a \"legitimate\" best-seller through increased sales due to its inclusion on the best-seller list,[7] leading to the best-seller list becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy for the booksellers.\n* **Leading data collection**. The *Times* provides booksellers with a form containing a list of books it believes might be bestsellers, to check off, with an alternative \"Other\" column to fill in manually.[7] It's been criticized as a leading technique to create a best-seller list based on books the *Times* thinks might be included.[7] One bookseller compared it to a voting card in which two options for president are provided: \"Bill Clinton and Other\".[7]\n* **Self-fulfilling**. Once a book makes it onto the list it is heavily marketed as a \"best-seller\", purchased by readers who seek out best-sellers, given preferential treatment by retailers, online and offline, who create special best-seller categories including special in-store placement and price discounts, and is carried by retailers that generally do not carry other books (e.g., supermarkets).[7] Thus, the list can become self-fulfilling in determining which books have high sales and remain on the list.[7]\n* **Conflicts of interest**. Due to high financial impact of making the list, since the 1970s publishers have created escalator clauses for major authors stipulating that if a book makes the list the author will receive extra money, based on where it ranks and for how long.[7] Authors may also be able to charge higher speaking fees for the status of being a best-seller.[7] As *Book History* said, \"With so much at stake then, it is no wonder that enormous marketing effort goes into getting a book access to this major marketing tool.\"[7]\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn 1983, author William Peter Blatty sued *The New York Times* for $6 million, claiming that his book, *Legion* (filmed as *The Exorcist III*), had not been included in the list due to either negligence or intentional falsehood, saying it should have been included due to high sales. The *Times* countered that the list was not mathematically objective but rather was editorial content and thus protected under the Constitution as free speech. Blatty appealed it to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case. Thus, the lower court ruling stood that the list is editorial content, not objective factual content, so the *Times* had the right to exclude books from the list.[7]\n\n\nIn 1995, Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema, the authors of a book called *The Discipline of Market Leaders*, colluded to manipulate their book onto the best seller charts. The authors allegedly purchased over 10,000 copies of their own book in small and strategically placed orders at bookstores whose sales are reported to BookScan. Because of the benefits of making *The New York Times* Best Seller list (speaking engagements, more book deals, and consulting) the authors felt that buying their own work was an investment that would pay for itself. The book climbed to No. 4 on the list where it sat for 15 weeks; it also peaked at No. 1 on the *BusinessWeek* best seller list. Since such lists hold the power of cumulative advantage, chart success often begets more chart success. Although such efforts are not illegal, publishers consider them unethical.[27]\n\n\nIn 1999, Amazon.com announced a 50% decrease in price for books on the Best Seller List to beat its competition, Barnes & Noble.[28] After a legal dispute between Amazon and *The New York Times*, Amazon was permitted to keep using the list on condition that it displayed it in alphabetical rather than numerical order.[29] By 2010, this was no longer the case; Amazon now displays the best-seller list in order of best-selling titles first.[30]\n\n\nIn 2013, *Forbes* published a story titled \"Here's How You Buy Your Way Onto *The New York Times* Bestsellers List.\"[31] The article discusses how ResultSource, a San Diego-based marketing consultancy, specializes in ensuring books make a bestseller list, even guaranteeing a No. 1 spot for those willing to pay enough. *The New York Times* was informed of this practice and responded: \"*The New York Times* comprehensively tracks and tabulates the weekly unit sales of all titles reported by book retailers as their general interest bestsellers. We will not comment beyond our methodology on the other questions.\" *The New York Times* did not alert its readers to this, unlike *The Wall Street Journal,* which admitted that books had landed on its bestseller list due to ResultSource's campaign.[32] Soren Kaplan, the source who admitted he had paid ResultSource to land his book, *Leapfrogging*, on *The Wall Street Journal*'s bestseller list, revealed the methodology on his blog; he posted: \"If I could obtain bulk orders before *Leapfrogging* was released, ResultSource would purchase the books on my behalf using their tried-and-true formula. Three thousand books sold would get me on *The Wall Street Journal* bestseller list. Eleven thousand would secure a spot on the biggest prize of them all, *The New York Times* list.\"[33]\n\n\nIn 2014, the *Los Angeles Times* published a story titled \"Can bestseller lists be bought?\"[34] It describes how author and pastor Mark Driscoll contracted the company ResultSource to place his book *Real Marriage* (2012) on *The New York Times* Best Seller list for a $200,000 fee. The contract was for ResultSource \"to conduct a bestseller campaign for your book, *Real Marriage* on the week of January 2, 2012. The bestseller campaign is intended to place *Real Marriage* on *The New York Times* bestseller list for the Advice How-to list.\" To achieve this, the contract stated that \"RSI will be purchasing at least 11,000 total orders in one week.\" This took place, and the book successfully reached No.1 on the hardcover advice bestseller list on January 22, 2014.[34]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Ted Cruz's book *A Time For Truth* was excluded from the list because the \"overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales [of Cruz's book] were limited to strategic bulk purchases\" to artificially increase sales and entry onto the list. In response, Cruz called the *Times* \"a liar\" and demanded an apology.[35] The *Times* said it stood by its statement and evidence of manipulation.\n\n\nIn August 2017, a young adult fiction book, *Handbook for Mortals* by previously unpublished author Lani Sarem was removed from the list, where it was in initially in the No. 1 spot. According to a statement issued by the *Times*, \"after investigating the inconsistencies in the most recent reporting cycle, we decided that the sales for *Handbook for Mortals* did not meet our criteria for inclusion. We've issued an updated 'Young Adult Hardcover' list for September 3, 2017 which does not include that title.\"[36] It was uncovered, by author Phil Stamper, that there had been unusual bulk ordering patterns which inflated the number of sales.[37] The book is published by GeekNation, an entertainment website based in Los Angeles.[36] The book was originally written as a script, and was rewritten as a novel in an attempt to launch a film franchise.[38][39]\n\n\nIn August 2017, conservative publisher Regnery Publishing said it would no longer allow its writers to claim to be \"*New York Times* best-selling authors\" due to its belief that the *Times* favors liberal books on the list. The *Times* responded that the political views of authors have no bearing on the list and noted conservative authors routinely rank highly on the list. The Associated Press noted the *Times* is a frequent target of conservatives and Republicans.[40] *The Washington Post* called Regenery's ban a \"stunt\" designed to increase sales, \"What better way to sell a book to a conservative audience than to promote the idea that the *New York Times* doesn't like it?\" The *Post* compared the list to best seller lists from *Publishers Weekly* looking for bias but could not find anything convincing.[41]\n\n\nIn February 2018, the *Toronto Star* published a story by books editor Deborah Dundas who found that the best-selling book *12 Rules for Life* by Jordan Peterson, who topped *Publishers Weekly* chart list, did not even chart on *The New York Times* bestsellers list, without reliable answers from the *New York Times*. The *Times* stated it was not counted because it was published by a Canadian company.[42] According to Random House Canada, the book was handled properly for the U.S. market.[43][44] American conservative commentator Dennis Prager wrote an article for *National Review* titled \"*The Times* Best-Seller List: Another Reason Americans Don't Trust the Media\" in which he contends that the issue with Peterson's book, as well his *The Rational Bible: Exodus*, is their conservative context and the lack of inclusion is the American mainstream media's manipulation.[45] The *Times* denied any bias.[46]\n\n\nIn 2019, the release of Donald Trump Jr.'s book *Triggered* was shown to have only reached the best-seller list through approximately $100,000 in behind-the-scenes bulk purchases meant to pump up its sales numbers illegitimately.[47] *Vanity Fair* reported in October 2020 that this sort of gaming of the system has been a common practice among American conservative political figures, and has also included the use of political campaign funds to purchase the books in bulk in order to boost their rank on the list.[48]\n\n\n\n## Studies[edit]\n\n\nA Stanford Business School analysis suggests that the \"majority of book buyers seem to use the *Times*' list as a signal of what's worth reading\".[49] The study concluded that lesser-known writers get the biggest benefit from being on the list, while perennial best-selling authors, such as John Grisham or Danielle Steel, see no benefit of additional sales.[49]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Books portal\n\n\n* Lists of *The New York Times* number-one books\n* Lists of *The New York Times* Manga Best Sellers\n* Oprah's Book Club\n* *Publishers Weekly* lists of bestselling novels in the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** John Bear, *The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago*, Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992.\n2. **^** Republican Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, while Chairman of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection, said \"the *New York Times* best-seller list is widely considered to be one of the most authoritative lists of which books are selling the most in American bookstores\" during his Opening Statement for Hearing on H.R. 1858 Archived May 2, 2017, at the Wayback Machine on June 15, 1999.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Diamond, Edwin (1995). *Behind the Times: Inside the New* New York Times.

In 2017, a *Times* representative said that the goal is that the lists reflect authentic best sellers.[4] The list has been a source of controversy. When the *Times* believes a book has reached the list in a suspicious way—such as through bulk purchases—the book's entry on the list is marked with a dagger symbol (†).[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External image |\n| --- |\n| ![image icon](image) *New York Times* Best-seller ListOct. 12, 1931\nThe first best-seller list was published with little fanfare for books sold in New York City only. |\n\n\nAlthough the first best seller list in America was published in 1895, in *The Bookman*, a best seller list was not published in *The New York Times* until October 12, 1931, 36 years later, with little fanfare.[6][7] It listed five fiction and four nonfiction books for New York City only.[7] The next month, the list was expanded to eight cities, each with its own list.[7] By the early 1940s, fourteen city-lists were included. A national list was created on April 9, 1942, in the Sunday *New York Times Book Review* as a supplement to the Monday edition regular city lists.[7] The national list was ranked according to how many times the book appeared in the city lists.[7] Eventually the city lists were eliminated, leaving only the national ranking list, which was compiled according to \"reports from leading booksellers in 22 cities\".[7] Ranking by bookseller sales figures continues today, although the process has remained proprietary.[3]\n\n\nBy the 1950s, *The Times*'s list had become the leading best-seller list for book professionals to monitor, along with that of *Publishers Weekly*.[7] In the 1960s and 1970s, shopping-mall chain bookstores B. Dalton, Crown Books, and Waldenbooks came to the forefront with a business model of selling newly published best-sellers with mass-market appeal. They used the best-selling status of titles to market the books and not just as a measure of sales, thus placing increased emphasis on the *New York Times* list for book readers and book sellers.[7]\n\n\nAs shown in the graph below, the number of titles achieving the number one spot has grown consistently over the years, ranging from fewer than 10 in the 1970s to the high thirties in the past decade. This graph represents fiction titles only. Years with smaller numbers means one or more titles dominated as major best sellers, notably *The Da Vinci Code* in 2003 and 2004, *Fifty Shades of Grey* in 2012 and *Where the Crawdads Sing* in 2019.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **NYT Number 1 Fiction Titles per Year** (1970–2022)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Some books are flagged with a dagger indicating that a significant number of bulk orders had been received by retail bookstores.[11]\n\n\n*The New York Times* reported in 2013 that \"we [generally do not] track the sales of classic literature,\" and thus, for example, new translations of Dante's *Inferno* would not be found on the bestseller list.[12]\n\n\nThe exact method for compiling the data obtained from the booksellers is classified as a trade secret.[3] Book Review staff editor Gregory Cowles explained the method \"is a secret both to protect our product and to make sure people can't try to rig the system. Even in the Book Review itself, we don't know (the news surveys department's) precise methods.\"[9] In 1992, the survey encompassed over 3,000 bookstores as well as \"representative wholesalers with more than 28,000 other retail outlets, including variety stores and supermarkets.\"[3] By 2004, the number was 4,000 bookstores as well as an unstated number of wholesalers.[7] Data is adjusted to give more weight to independent book stores, which are underrepresented in the sample.[7]\n\n\nThe lists are divided among fiction and nonfiction, print and e-book, paperback and hardcover; each list contains 15 to 20 titles. The lists have been subdivided several times. \"Advice, How-To, and Miscellaneous\" debuted as a list of five on January 1, 1984. It was created because advice best-sellers were sometimes crowding the general nonfiction list.[13] Its inaugural number one bestseller, *The Body Principal* by Victoria Principal, had been number 10 and number 12 on the nonfiction lists for the two preceding weeks.[14][15] In July 2000, the \"Children's Best Sellers\" was created after the Harry Potter series had stayed in the top spots on the fiction list for an extended period of time.[16][17] The children's list was printed monthly until February 13, 2011, when it was changed to once an issue (weekly). In September 2007, the paperback fiction list was divided into \"trade\" and \"mass-market\" sections, in order to give more visibility to the trade paperbacks that were more often reviewed by the newspaper itself.[18] In November 2010, *The New York Times* announced it would be tracking e-book best-seller lists in fiction and nonfiction starting in early 2011.[19] \"RoyaltyShare, a San Diego-based company that tracks data and aggregates sales information for publishers, will ... provide [e-book] data\".[19] The two new e-book lists were first published with the February 13, 2011, issue, the first tracks combined print and e-book sales, the second tracks e-book sales only (both lists are further sub-divided into Fiction and Nonfiction). In addition a third new list was published on the web only, which tracks combined print sales (hardcover and paperback) in fiction and nonfiction. On December 16, 2012, the children's chapter books list was divided into two new lists: middle-grade (ages 8–12) and young adult (age 12–18), both which include sales across all platforms (hard, paper and e-book).\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an EPJ Data Science study that used big data to analyze every *New York Times* bestselling book from 2008 to 2016, of the 100,000 new, hardcover print books published each year, fewer than 500 make it on to *The New York Times Best Seller* list (0.5 percent). Most novels (26 percent) appear on the list for only one week. To make the list, it is estimated that novels sell from 1,000 to 10,000 copies per week, depending on competition. Median sales fluctuate between 4,000 and 8,000 in fiction, and 2,000–6,000 in nonfiction. The majority of *New York Times* bestselling books sell from 10,000 to 100,000 copies in their first year.[20][21]\n\n\nDuring the period studied (August 6, 2008, to March 10, 2016), Dan Brown's book *The Lost Symbol* held the record with 3 million copies sold in one year followed by *The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest* by Stieg Larsson and *Go Set a Watchman* by Harper Lee which sold 1.6 million copies each. In nonfiction, more than half of the hardcover books that make the list are in the biography category. The autobiography of George W. Bush, *Decision Points*, sold the most copies in one year followed by the biography *Steve Jobs* by Walter Isaacson.[20]\n\n\n\n## Criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe list has been criticized by authors, publishers, book industry executives, and others for not providing an accurate accounting of true best-seller status. These criticisms have been ongoing ever since the list originated. A book industry report in the 1940s found that best-seller lists were a poor indicator of sales, since they were based on misleading data and were only measuring fast sales. A 2004 report quoted a senior book marketing executive who said the rankings were \"smoke and mirrors\"; while a report in *Book History* found that many professionals in the book industry \"scoffed at the notion that the lists are accurate\".[7]\n\n\nSpecific criticisms include:\n\n\n\n* **Fast sales**.[7][22] A book that never makes the list can actually outsell books on the best-seller list. This is because the best-seller list reflects sales in a given week, not total sales. Thus, one book may sell heavily in a given week, making the list, while another may sell at a slower pace, never making the list, but selling more copies over time.\n* **Double counting**. By including wholesalers in the polls along with retail bookstores, books may be double-counted.[7] Wholesalers report how much they sell to retailers, and retailers report how much they sell to customers, thus there can be overlap with the same reported book being sold twice within a given time frame. In addition, retailers may return books to wholesalers months later if they never sell, thus resulting in a \"sale\" being reported that never came to fruition. For example, mass-market paperbacks can see as high as 40% return rates from the retailer back to the wholesaler.[7]\n* **Manipulation by authors and publishers**. In 1956, author Jean Shepherd created the fake novel *I, Libertine* to illustrate how easy it was to manipulate the best-seller lists based on demand, as well as sales. Fans of Shepherd's radio show planted references to the book and author so widely that demand for the book led to claims of it being on the *Times* list.[23][24] Author Jacqueline Susann (*Valley of the Dolls*) attempted to \"butter-up\" *Times*-reporting booksellers and personally bought large quantities of her own book.[7] Author Wayne Dyer (*Your Erroneous Zones*) purchased thousands of copies of his own book.[7] Al Neuharth (*Confessions of an S. O. B.*), former head of Gannett Company, had his Gannett Foundation buy two thousand copies of his own autobiography.[7] In 1995, authors Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema spent $200,000 to buy ten thousand copies of *The Discipline of Market Leaders* from dozens of bookstores.[7] Although they denied any wrongdoing, the book spent 15 weeks on the list. As a result of this scandal the *Times* began placing a dagger symbol next to any title for which bookstores reported bulk orders.[7] However, daggers do not always appear; for example Tony Hsieh's *Delivering Happiness* was known to have been manipulated with bulk orders but did not have a dagger.[25] Companies that contract with authors to manipulate the bestseller list through \"bestseller campaigns\" include ResultSource.[26]\n* **Manipulation by retailers and wholesalers**.[7] It happens with regularity that wholesalers and retailers deliberately or inadvertently manipulate the sales data they report to the *Times*.[7] Since being on the *Times* best-seller list increases the sales of a book, bookstores and wholesalers may report a book is a best-seller before it actually is one, in order that it might later become a \"legitimate\" best-seller through increased sales due to its inclusion on the best-seller list,[7] leading to the best-seller list becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy for the booksellers.\n* **Leading data collection**. The *Times* provides booksellers with a form containing a list of books it believes might be bestsellers, to check off, with an alternative \"Other\" column to fill in manually.[7] It's been criticized as a leading technique to create a best-seller list based on books the *Times* thinks might be included.[7] One bookseller compared it to a voting card in which two options for president are provided: \"Bill Clinton and Other\".[7]\n* **Self-fulfilling**. Once a book makes it onto the list it is heavily marketed as a \"best-seller\", purchased by readers who seek out best-sellers, given preferential treatment by retailers, online and offline, who create special best-seller categories including special in-store placement and price discounts, and is carried by retailers that generally do not carry other books (e.g., supermarkets).[7] Thus, the list can become self-fulfilling in determining which books have high sales and remain on the list.[7]\n* **Conflicts of interest**. Due to high financial impact of making the list, since the 1970s publishers have created escalator clauses for major authors stipulating that if a book makes the list the author will receive extra money, based on where it ranks and for how long.[7] Authors may also be able to charge higher speaking fees for the status of being a best-seller.[7] As *Book History* said, \"With so much at stake then, it is no wonder that enormous marketing effort goes into getting a book access to this major marketing tool.\"[7]\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn 1983, author William Peter Blatty sued *The New York Times* for $6 million, claiming that his book, *Legion* (filmed as *The Exorcist III*), had not been included in the list due to either negligence or intentional falsehood, saying it should have been included due to high sales. The *Times* countered that the list was not mathematically objective but rather was editorial content and thus protected under the Constitution as free speech. Blatty appealed it to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case. Thus, the lower court ruling stood that the list is editorial content, not objective factual content, so the *Times* had the right to exclude books from the list.[7]\n\n\nIn 1995, Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema, the authors of a book called *The Discipline of Market Leaders*, colluded to manipulate their book onto the best seller charts. The authors allegedly purchased over 10,000 copies of their own book in small and strategically placed orders at bookstores whose sales are reported to BookScan. Because of the benefits of making *The New York Times* Best Seller list (speaking engagements, more book deals, and consulting) the authors felt that buying their own work was an investment that would pay for itself. The book climbed to No. 4 on the list where it sat for 15 weeks; it also peaked at No. 1 on the *BusinessWeek* best seller list. Since such lists hold the power of cumulative advantage, chart success often begets more chart success. Although such efforts are not illegal, publishers consider them unethical.[27]\n\n\nIn 1999, Amazon.com announced a 50% decrease in price for books on the Best Seller List to beat its competition, Barnes & Noble.[28] After a legal dispute between Amazon and *The New York Times*, Amazon was permitted to keep using the list on condition that it displayed it in alphabetical rather than numerical order.[29] By 2010, this was no longer the case; Amazon now displays the best-seller list in order of best-selling titles first.[30]\n\n\nIn 2013, *Forbes* published a story titled \"Here's How You Buy Your Way Onto *The New York Times* Bestsellers List.\"[31] The article discusses how ResultSource, a San Diego-based marketing consultancy, specializes in ensuring books make a bestseller list, even guaranteeing a No. 1 spot for those willing to pay enough. *The New York Times* was informed of this practice and responded: \"*The New York Times* comprehensively tracks and tabulates the weekly unit sales of all titles reported by book retailers as their general interest bestsellers. We will not comment beyond our methodology on the other questions.\" *The New York Times* did not alert its readers to this, unlike *The Wall Street Journal,* which admitted that books had landed on its bestseller list due to ResultSource's campaign.[32] Soren Kaplan, the source who admitted he had paid ResultSource to land his book, *Leapfrogging*, on *The Wall Street Journal*'s bestseller list, revealed the methodology on his blog; he posted: \"If I could obtain bulk orders before *Leapfrogging* was released, ResultSource would purchase the books on my behalf using their tried-and-true formula. Three thousand books sold would get me on *The Wall Street Journal* bestseller list. Eleven thousand would secure a spot on the biggest prize of them all, *The New York Times* list.\"[33]\n\n\nIn 2014, the *Los Angeles Times* published a story titled \"Can bestseller lists be bought?\"[34] It describes how author and pastor Mark Driscoll contracted the company ResultSource to place his book *Real Marriage* (2012) on *The New York Times* Best Seller list for a $200,000 fee. The contract was for ResultSource \"to conduct a bestseller campaign for your book, *Real Marriage* on the week of January 2, 2012. The bestseller campaign is intended to place *Real Marriage* on *The New York Times* bestseller list for the Advice How-to list.\" To achieve this, the contract stated that \"RSI will be purchasing at least 11,000 total orders in one week.\" This took place, and the book successfully reached No.1 on the hardcover advice bestseller list on January 22, 2014.[34]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Ted Cruz's book *A Time For Truth* was excluded from the list because the \"overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales [of Cruz's book] were limited to strategic bulk purchases\" to artificially increase sales and entry onto the list. In response, Cruz called the *Times* \"a liar\" and demanded an apology.[35] The *Times* said it stood by its statement and evidence of manipulation.\n\n\nIn August 2017, a young adult fiction book, *Handbook for Mortals* by previously unpublished author Lani Sarem was removed from the list, where it was in initially in the No. 1 spot. According to a statement issued by the *Times*, \"after investigating the inconsistencies in the most recent reporting cycle, we decided that the sales for *Handbook for Mortals* did not meet our criteria for inclusion. We've issued an updated 'Young Adult Hardcover' list for September 3, 2017 which does not include that title.\"[36] It was uncovered, by author Phil Stamper, that there had been unusual bulk ordering patterns which inflated the number of sales.[37] The book is published by GeekNation, an entertainment website based in Los Angeles.[36] The book was originally written as a script, and was rewritten as a novel in an attempt to launch a film franchise.[38][39]\n\n\nIn August 2017, conservative publisher Regnery Publishing said it would no longer allow its writers to claim to be \"*New York Times* best-selling authors\" due to its belief that the *Times* favors liberal books on the list. The *Times* responded that the political views of authors have no bearing on the list and noted conservative authors routinely rank highly on the list. The Associated Press noted the *Times* is a frequent target of conservatives and Republicans.[40] *The Washington Post* called Regenery's ban a \"stunt\" designed to increase sales, \"What better way to sell a book to a conservative audience than to promote the idea that the *New York Times* doesn't like it?\" The *Post* compared the list to best seller lists from *Publishers Weekly* looking for bias but could not find anything convincing.[41]\n\n\nIn February 2018, the *Toronto Star* published a story by books editor Deborah Dundas who found that the best-selling book *12 Rules for Life* by Jordan Peterson, who topped *Publishers Weekly* chart list, did not even chart on *The New York Times* bestsellers list, without reliable answers from the *New York Times*. The *Times* stated it was not counted because it was published by a Canadian company.[42] According to Random House Canada, the book was handled properly for the U.S. market.[43][44] American conservative commentator Dennis Prager wrote an article for *National Review* titled \"*The Times* Best-Seller List: Another Reason Americans Don't Trust the Media\" in which he contends that the issue with Peterson's book, as well his *The Rational Bible: Exodus*, is their conservative context and the lack of inclusion is the American mainstream media's manipulation.[45] The *Times* denied any bias.[46]\n\n\nIn 2019, the release of Donald Trump Jr.'s book *Triggered* was shown to have only reached the best-seller list through approximately $100,000 in behind-the-scenes bulk purchases meant to pump up its sales numbers illegitimately.[47] *Vanity Fair* reported in October 2020 that this sort of gaming of the system has been a common practice among American conservative political figures, and has also included the use of political campaign funds to purchase the books in bulk in order to boost their rank on the list.[48]\n\n\n\n## Studies[edit]\n\n\nA Stanford Business School analysis suggests that the \"majority of book buyers seem to use the *Times*' list as a signal of what's worth reading\".[49] The study concluded that lesser-known writers get the biggest benefit from being on the list, while perennial best-selling authors, such as John Grisham or Danielle Steel, see no benefit of additional sales.[49]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Books portal\n\n\n* Lists of *The New York Times* number-one books\n* Lists of *The New York Times* Manga Best Sellers\n* Oprah's Book Club\n* *Publishers Weekly* lists of bestselling novels in the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** John Bear, *The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago*, Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992.\n2. **^** Republican Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, while Chairman of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection, said \"the *New York Times* best-seller list is widely considered to be one of the most authoritative lists of which books are selling the most in American bookstores\" during his Opening Statement for Hearing on H.R. 1858 Archived May 2, 2017, at the Wayback Machine on June 15, 1999.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Diamond, Edwin (1995). *Behind the Times: Inside the New* New York Times.

You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThis page provides **lists of best-selling books and book series** to date and in any language. *\"Best-selling\"* refers to the estimated number of copies sold of each book, rather than the number of books printed or currently owned. Comics and textbooks are not included in this list. The books are listed according to the highest sales estimate as reported in reliable, independent sources.\n\n\nAccording to *Guinness World Records* as of 1995, the Bible is the best selling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed.[1] Sales estimates for other printed religious texts include at least 800 million copies for the Qur'an and 190 million copies for the Book of Mormon.[2] Also, a single publisher has produced more than 140 million copies of the Bhagavad Gita. The total number could be much higher.[3] Among non-religious texts, the *Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung*, also known as the *Little Red Book*, has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures—with estimates ranging from 800 million[1] to over 6.5 billion printed volumes.[4] Some claim the distribution ran into the \"billions\"[5] and some cite \"over a billion\" official volumes between 1966 and 1969 alone as well as \"untold numbers of unofficial local reprints and unofficial translations\".[6][7] Exact print figures for these and other books may also be missing or unreliable since these kinds of books may be produced by many different and unrelated publishers, in some cases over many centuries. All books of a religious, ideological, philosophical or political nature have thus been excluded from the lists of best-selling books below for these reasons.\n\n\nMany books lack comprehensive sales figures as book selling and reselling figures prior to the introduction of point of sale equipment was based on the estimates of book sellers, publishers or the authors themselves. For example, *The Lord of the Rings* as one text was recorded to have sold only 967,466 copies in the UK by 2009, but at the same time the author's estate claimed global sales figures of in excess of 150 million.[8] As such accurate figures are only available from the 1990s and in western nations such as US, UK and Australia. Further, e-books have not been included as out of copyright texts are often available freely in this format. Examples of books with reported high sales include *The Count of Monte Cristo* by Alexandre Dumas,[9] *Don Quixote* by Miguel de Cervantes,[10] *Journey to the West* by Wu Cheng'en[11] and *The Lord of the Rings*[12] (which has been sold as both a three volume series, *The Fellowship of the Ring*, *The Two Towers*, and *The Return of the King*, and as a single combined volume) by J. R. R. Tolkien. Hence, in cases where there is too much uncertainty, they are excluded from the list.\n\n\nHaving sold more than 600 million copies worldwide*,[13] Harry Potter* by J. K. Rowling is the best-selling book series in history. The first novel in the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, has sold in excess of 120 million copies,[14] making it one of the best-selling books of all time. As of June 2017, the series has been translated into 85 languages,[15] placing *Harry Potter* among history's most translated literary works. The last four books in the series consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books of all time, and the final installment, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, sold roughly fifteen million copies worldwide within twenty-four hours of its release.[16][17] With twelve million books printed in the first US run, it also holds the record for the highest initial print run for any book in history.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n  Nonfiction\n\n\n\n## List of best-selling individual books[edit]\n\n\n### More than 100 million copies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Book | Author(s) | Original language | First published | Approximate sales\n | Genre\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *A Tale of Two Cities* | Charles Dickens | English | 1859 | >200 million[20][*circular reporting?*] | Historical fiction |\n| *The Little Prince* (*Le Petit Prince*) | Antoine de Saint-Exupéry | French | 1943 | 200 million[21][22] | Fantasy, Children's fiction |\n| *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* | J.

His novels and short stories are widely read today.[2][3]\n\n\nBorn in Portsmouth, Dickens left school at the age of 12 to work in a boot-blacking factory when his father John was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. After three years he returned to school, before he began his literary career as a journalist. Dickens edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed readings extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, for education, and for other social reforms.\n\n\nDickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of *The Pickwick Papers*, a publishing phenomenon—thanks largely to the introduction of the character Sam Weller in the fourth episode—that sparked *Pickwick* merchandise and spin-offs. Within a few years, Dickens had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most of them published in monthly or weekly installments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.[4][5] Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense.[6] The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback.[5] For example, when his wife's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in *David Copperfield* seemed to reflect her own disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features.[7] His plots were carefully constructed and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives.[8] Masses of the illiterate poor would individually pay a halfpenny to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.[9]\n\n\nHis 1843 novella *A Christmas Carol* remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every creative medium. *Oliver Twist* and *Great Expectations* are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel *A Tale of Two Cities* (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.[10] The term *Dickensian* is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dickens family\n\n![](image)Charles Dickens's birthplace, 393 Commercial Road, Portsmouth\n![photograph](image)2 Ordnance Terrace, Chatham, Dickens's home 1817 – May 1821[13]\nCharles Dickens was born on 7 February 1812 at 1 Mile End Terrace (now 393 Commercial Road), Landport in Portsea Island (Portsmouth), Hampshire, the second of eight children of Elizabeth Dickens (née Barrow; 1789–1863) and John Dickens (1785–1851). His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam,[14] rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles. Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens's novel *Dombey and Son* (1848).[14]\n\n\nIn January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London, and the family moved to Norfolk Street, Fitzrovia.[15] When Charles was four, they relocated to Sheerness and thence to Chatham, Kent, where he spent his formative years until the age of 11. His early life seems to have been idyllic, though he thought himself a \"very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy\".[16]\n\n\nCharles spent time outdoors, but also read voraciously, including the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding, as well as *Robinson Crusoe* and *Gil Blas*. He read and re-read *The Arabian Nights* and the Collected Farces of Elizabeth Inchbald.[17] At the age of 7 he first saw Joseph Grimaldi—the father of modern clowning—perform at the Star Theatre, Rochester.[18] He later imitated Grimaldi's clowning on several occasions, and would also edit the *Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi*.[19][nb 1] He retained poignant memories of childhood, helped by an excellent memory of people and events, which he used in his writing.[22] His father's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education, first at a dame school and then at a school run by William Giles, a dissenter, in Chatham.[23]\n\n\n\n![drawing](image)Illustration by Fred Bernard of Dickens at work in a shoe-blacking factory after his father had been sent to the Marshalsea, published in the 1892 edition of Forster's *Life of Charles Dickens*[24]\nThis period came to an end in June 1822, when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at Somerset House and the family (except for Charles, who stayed behind to finish his final term at school) moved to Camden Town in London.[25] The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts and, living beyond his means,[26] John Dickens was forced by his creditors into the Marshalsea debtors' prison in Southwark, London in 1824. His wife and youngest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time. Charles, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town.[27] Mrs Roylance was \"a reduced impoverished old lady, long known to our family\", whom Dickens later immortalised, \"with a few alterations and embellishments\", as \"Mrs Pipchin\" in *Dombey and Son*. Later, he lived in a back-attic in the house of an agent for the Insolvent Court, Archibald Russell, \"a fat, good-natured, kind old gentleman ... with a quiet old wife\" and lame son, in Lant Street in Southwark.[28] They provided the inspiration for the Garlands in *The Old Curiosity Shop*.[29]\n\n\nOn Sundays – with his sister Frances, free from her studies at the Royal Academy of Music – he spent the day at the Marshalsea.[30] Dickens later used the prison as a setting in *Little Dorrit*. To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's Blacking Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present Charing Cross railway station, where he earned six shillings a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered \"how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age\".[31] As he recalled to John Forster (from *Life of Charles Dickens*):\n\n\n\n\n> The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.[31]\n> \n> \n\n\nWhen the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart, busy district of Covent Garden, the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street. Small audiences gathered and watched them at work – in Dickens's biographer Simon Callow's estimation, the public display was \"a new refinement added to his misery\".[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Marshalsea around 1897, after it had closed. Dickens based several of his characters on the experience of seeing his father in the debtors' prison, most notably Amy Dorrit from *Little Dorrit*.\nA few months after his imprisonment, John Dickens's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, died and bequeathed him £450. On the expectation of this legacy, Dickens was released from prison. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act, Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors, and he and his family left the Marshalsea,[33] for the home of Mrs Roylance.\n\n\nCharles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not immediately support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse. This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: \"I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back.\" His mother's failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women.[34]\n\n\nRighteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which working-class people lived became major themes of his works, and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite, and most autobiographical, novel, *David Copperfield*:[35] \"I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no assistance, no support, of any kind, from anyone, that I can call to mind, as I hope to go to heaven!\"[36]\n\n\nDickens was eventually sent to the Wellington House Academy in Camden Town, where he remained until March 1827, having spent about two years there. He did not consider it to be a good school: \"Much of the haphazard, desultory teaching, poor discipline punctuated by the headmaster's sadistic brutality, the seedy ushers and general run-down atmosphere, are embodied in Mr Creakle's Establishment in *David Copperfield*.\"[36]\n\n\nDickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore, attorneys, of Holborn Court, Gray's Inn, as a junior clerk from May 1827 to November 1828. He was a gifted mimic and impersonated those around him: clients, lawyers and clerks. He went to theatres obsessively: he claimed that for at least three years he went to the theatre every day. His favourite actor was Charles Mathews and Dickens learnt his \"monopolylogues\" (farces in which Mathews played every character) by heart.[37] Then, having learned Gurney's system of shorthand in his spare time, he left to become a freelance reporter. A distant relative, Thomas Charlton, was a freelance reporter at Doctors' Commons and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years.[38][39] This education was to inform works such as *Nicholas Nickleby*, *Dombey and Son* and especially *Bleak House*, whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of Dickens's own views regarding, particularly, the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to \"go to law\".\n\n\nIn 1830, Dickens met his first love, Maria Beadnell, thought to have been the model for the character Dora in *David Copperfield*. Maria's parents disapproved of the courtship and ended the relationship by sending her to school in Paris.[40]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Journalism and writing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Catherine Hogarth Dickens by Samuel Laurence (1838). She met the author in 1834, and they became engaged the following year before marrying in April 1836.\nIn 1832, at the age of 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident.[41] He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame. Drawn to the theatre – he became an early member of the Garrick Club[42] – he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager George Bartley and the actor Charles Kemble were to see him. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold. Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer.[43]\n\n\nIn 1833, Dickens submitted his first story, \"A Dinner at Poplar Walk\", to the London periodical *Monthly Magazine*.[44] William Barrow, Dickens's uncle on his mother's side, offered him a job on *The Mirror of Parliament* and he worked in the House of Commons for the first time early in 1832. He rented rooms at Furnival's Inn and worked as a political journalist, reporting on Parliamentary debates, and he travelled across Britain to cover election campaigns for the *Morning Chronicle*. His journalism, in the form of sketches in periodicals, formed his first collection of pieces, published in 1836: *Sketches by Boz* – Boz being a family nickname he employed as a pseudonym for some years.[45][46] Dickens apparently adopted it from the nickname 'Moses', which he had given to his youngest brother Augustus Dickens, after a character in Oliver Goldsmith's *The Vicar of Wakefield*. When pronounced by anyone with a head cold, \"Moses\" became \"Boses\" – later shortened to *Boz*.[46][47] Dickens's own name was considered \"queer\" by a contemporary critic, who wrote in 1849: \"Mr Dickens, as if in revenge for his own queer name, does bestow still queerer ones upon his fictitious creations.\" Dickens contributed to and edited journals throughout his literary career.[44] In January 1835, the *Morning Chronicle* launched an evening edition, under the editorship of the *Chronicle*'s music critic, George Hogarth. Hogarth invited him to contribute *Street Sketches* and Dickens became a regular visitor to his Fulham house – excited by Hogarth's friendship with Walter Scott (whom Dickens greatly admired) and enjoying the company of Hogarth's three daughters: Georgina, Mary and 19-year-old Catherine.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)The wise-cracking, warm-hearted servant Sam Weller from *The Pickwick Papers*—a publishing phenomenon that sparked numerous spin-offs and *Pickwick* merchandise—made the 24-year-old Dickens famous.[49]\nDickens made rapid progress both professionally and socially. He began a friendship with William Harrison Ainsworth, the author of the highwayman novel *Rookwood* (1834), whose bachelor salon in Harrow Road had become the meeting place for a set that included Daniel Maclise, Benjamin Disraeli, Edward Bulwer-Lytton and George Cruikshank. All these became his friends and collaborators, with the exception of Disraeli, and he met his first publisher, John Macrone, at the house.[50] The success of *Sketches by Boz* led to a proposal from publishers Chapman and Hall for Dickens to supply text to match Robert Seymour's engraved illustrations in a monthly letterpress. Seymour committed suicide after the second instalment and Dickens, who wanted to write a connected series of sketches, hired \"Phiz\" to provide the engravings (which were reduced from four to two per instalment) for the story. The resulting story became *The Pickwick Papers* and, although the first few episodes were not successful, the introduction of the Cockney character Sam Weller in the fourth episode (the first to be illustrated by Phiz) marked a sharp climb in its popularity.[51] The final instalment sold 40,000 copies.[44] On the impact of the character, *The Paris Review* stated, \"arguably the most historic bump in English publishing is the Sam Weller Bump.\"[49] A publishing phenomenon, John Sutherland called *The Pickwick Papers* \"[t]he most important single novel of the Victorian era\".[52] The unprecedented success led to numerous spin-offs and merchandise including *Pickwick* cigars, playing cards, china figurines, Sam Weller puzzles, Weller boot polish and joke books.[49]\n\n\n\n\n> The Sam Weller Bump testifies not merely to Dickens's comic genius but to his acumen as an \"authorpreneur\", a portmanteau he inhabited long before *The Economist* took it up. For a writer who made his reputation crusading against the squalor of the Industrial Revolution, Dickens was a creature of capitalism; he used everything from the powerful new printing presses to the enhanced advertising revenues to the expansion of railroads to sell more books. Dickens ensured that his books were available in cheap bindings for the lower orders as well as in morocco-and-gilt for people of quality; his ideal readership included everyone from the pickpockets who read *Oliver Twist* to Queen Victoria, who found it \"exceedingly interesting\".\n> \n> \n> — How *The Pickwick Papers* Launched Charles Dickens's Career, *The Paris Review*.[49]\n> \n\n\n\nOn the creation of modern mass culture, Nicholas Dames in *The Atlantic* writes, \"'Literature' is not a big enough category for *Pickwick*. It defined its own, a new one that we have learned to call 'entertainment'.\"[53] In November 1836, Dickens accepted the position of editor of *Bentley's Miscellany*, a position he held for three years, until he fell out with the owner.[54] In 1836, as he finished the last instalments of *The Pickwick Papers*, he began writing the beginning instalments of *Oliver Twist* – writing as many as 90 pages a month – while continuing work on *Bentley's* and also writing four plays, the production of which he oversaw. *Oliver Twist*, published in 1838, became one of Dickens's better known stories and was the first Victorian novel with a child protagonist.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Young Charles Dickens by Daniel Maclise, 1839\nOn 2 April 1836, after a one-year engagement, and between episodes two and three of *The Pickwick Papers*, Dickens married Catherine Thomson Hogarth (1815–1879), the daughter of George Hogarth, editor of the *Evening Chronicle*.[56] They were married in St Luke's Church,[57] Chelsea, London. After a brief honeymoon in Chalk in Kent, the couple returned to lodgings at Furnival's Inn.[58] The first of their ten children, Charles, was born in January 1837 and a few months later the family set up home in Bloomsbury at 48 Doughty Street, London (on which Charles had a three-year lease at £80 a year) from 25 March 1837 until December 1839.[56][59] Dickens's younger brother Frederick and Catherine's 17-year-old sister Mary Hogarth moved in with them. Dickens became very attached to Mary, and she died in his arms after a brief illness in 1837. Unusually for Dickens, as a consequence of his shock, he stopped working, and he and Catherine stayed at a little farm on Hampstead Heath for a fortnight. Dickens idealised Mary; the character he fashioned after her, Rose Maylie, he found he could not now kill, as he had planned, in his fiction,[60] and, according to Ackroyd, he drew on memories of her for his later descriptions of Little Nell and Florence Dombey.[61] His grief was so great that he was unable to meet the deadline for the June instalment of *The Pickwick Papers* and had to cancel the *Oliver Twist* instalment that month as well.[55] The time in Hampstead was the occasion for a growing bond between Dickens and John Forster to develop; Forster soon became his unofficial business manager and the first to read his work.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Barnaby Rudge* was Dickens's first popular failure but the character of Dolly Varden, \"pretty, witty, sexy, became central to numerous theatrical adaptations\"[63]\nHis success as a novelist continued. The young Queen Victoria read both *Oliver Twist* and *The Pickwick Papers*, staying up until midnight to discuss them.[64] *Nicholas Nickleby* (1838–39), *The Old Curiosity Shop* (1840–41) and, finally, his first historical novel, *Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty*, as part of the *Master Humphrey's Clock* series (1840–41), were all published in monthly instalments before being made into books.[65]\n\n\nIn the midst of all his activity during this period, there was discontent with his publishers and John Macrone was bought off, while Richard Bentley signed over all his rights in *Oliver Twist*. Other signs of a certain restlessness and discontent emerged; in Broadstairs he flirted with Eleanor Picken, the young fiancée of his solicitor's best friend and one night grabbed her and ran with her down to the sea. He declared they were both to drown there in the \"sad sea waves\". She finally got free, and afterwards kept her distance. In June 1841, he precipitously set out on a two-month tour of Scotland and then, in September 1841, telegraphed Forster that he had decided to go to America.[66] *Master Humphrey's Clock* was shut down, though Dickens was still keen on the idea of the weekly magazine, a form he liked, an appreciation that had begun with his childhood reading of the 18th-century magazines *Tatler* and *The Spectator*.\n\n\nDickens was perturbed by the return to power of the Tories, whom he described as \"people whom, politically, I despise and abhor.\"[67] He had been tempted to stand for the Liberals in Reading, but decided against it due to financial straits.[67] He wrote three anti-Tory verse satires (\"The Fine Old English Gentleman\", \"The Quack Doctor's Proclamation\", and \"Subjects for Painters\") which were published in *The Examiner*.[68]\n\n\n\n\n### First visit to the United States[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 January 1842, Dickens and his wife arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, aboard the RMS *Britannia* during their first trip to the United States and Canada.[69] At this time Georgina Hogarth, another sister of Catherine, joined the Dickens household, now living at Devonshire Terrace, Marylebone to care for the young family they had left behind.[70] She remained with them as housekeeper, organiser, adviser and friend until Dickens's death in 1870.[71] Dickens modelled the character of Agnes Wickfield after Georgina and Mary.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sketch of Dickens in 1842 during his first American tour. Sketch of Dickens's sister Fanny, bottom left\nHe described his impressions in a travelogue, *American Notes for General Circulation*. In *Notes*, Dickens includes a powerful condemnation of slavery which he had attacked as early as *The Pickwick Papers*, correlating the emancipation of the poor in England with the abolition of slavery abroad[73] citing newspaper accounts of runaway slaves disfigured by their masters. In spite of the abolitionist sentiments gleaned from his trip to America, some modern commentators have pointed out inconsistencies in Dickens's views on racial inequality. For instance, he has been criticised for his subsequent acquiescence in Governor Eyre's harsh crackdown during the 1860s Morant Bay rebellion in Jamaica and his failure to join other British progressives in condemning it.[74] From Richmond, Virginia, Dickens returned to Washington, D.C., and started a trek westward, with brief pauses in Cincinnati and Louisville, to St. Louis, Missouri. While there, he expressed a desire to see an American prairie before returning east. A group of 13 men then set out with Dickens to visit Looking Glass Prairie, a trip 30 miles into Illinois.\n\n\nDuring his American visit, Dickens spent a month in New York City, giving lectures, raising the question of international copyright laws and the pirating of his work in America.[75][76] He persuaded a group of 25 writers, headed by Washington Irving, to sign a petition for him to take to Congress, but the press were generally hostile to this, saying that he should be grateful for his popularity and that it was mercenary to complain about his work being pirated.[77]\n\n\nThe popularity he gained caused a shift in his self-perception according to critic Kate Flint, who writes that he \"found himself a cultural commodity, and its circulation had passed out his control\", causing him to become interested in and delve into themes of public and personal personas in the next novels.[78] She writes that he assumed a role of \"influential commentator\", publicly and in his fiction, evident in his next few books.[78] His trip to the U.S. ended with a trip to Canada – Niagara Falls, Toronto, Kingston and Montreal – where he appeared on stage in light comedies.[79]\n\n\n\n![](image)Dickens's portrait by Margaret Gillies, 1843. Painted during the period when he was writing *A Christmas Carol*, it was in the Royal Academy of Arts' 1844 summer exhibition. After viewing it there, Elizabeth Barrett Browning said that it showed Dickens with \"the dust and mud of humanity about him, notwithstanding those eagle eyes\".[80]\n### Return to England[edit]\n\n\nSoon after his return to England, Dickens began work on the first of his Christmas stories, *A Christmas Carol*, written in 1843, which was followed by *The Chimes* in 1844 and *The Cricket on the Hearth* in 1845. Of these, *A Christmas Carol* was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America.[81] The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane Ragged School, caused Dickens to resolve to \"strike a sledge hammer blow\" for the poor. As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became engrossed in the book. He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he \"wept and laughed, and wept again\" as he \"walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed\".[82]\n\n\nAfter living briefly in Italy (1844), Dickens travelled to Switzerland (1846), where he began work on *Dombey and Son* (1846–48). This and *David Copperfield* (1849–50) mark a significant artistic break in Dickens's career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works.\n\n\nAt about this time, he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother, Augustus, worked (John Chapman & Co). It had been carried out by Thomas Powell, a clerk, who was on friendly terms with Dickens and who had acted as mentor to Augustus when he started work. Powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day. After further fraudulent activities, Powell fled to New York and published a book called *The Living Authors of England* with a chapter on Charles Dickens, who was not amused by what Powell had written. One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey (*Dombey and Son*) on Thomas Chapman, one of the principal partners at John Chapman & Co. Dickens immediately sent a letter to Lewis Gaylord Clark, editor of the New York literary magazine *The Knickerbocker*, saying that Powell was a forger and thief. Clark published the letter in the *New-York Tribune* and several other papers picked up on the story. Powell began proceedings to sue these publications and Clark was arrested. Dickens, realising that he had acted in haste, contacted John Chapman & Co to seek written confirmation of Powell's guilt. Dickens did receive a reply confirming Powell's embezzlement, but once the directors realised this information might have to be produced in court, they refused to make further disclosures. Owing to the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his accusations, Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of court.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dickens presiding over a charity meeting to discuss the future of the College of God's Gift; from *The Illustrated London News*, March 1856\nAngela Burdett Coutts, heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of fallen women of the working class. Coutts envisioned a home that would replace the punitive regimes of existing institutions with a reformative environment conducive to education and proficiency in domestic household chores. After initially resisting, Dickens eventually founded the home, named Urania Cottage, in the Lime Grove area of Shepherd's Bush, which he managed for ten years,[84] setting the house rules, reviewing the accounts and interviewing prospective residents.[85] Emigration and marriage were central to Dickens's agenda for the women on leaving Urania Cottage, from which it is estimated that about 100 women graduated between 1847 and 1859.[86]\n\n\n\n#### Religious views[edit]\n\n\nAs a young man, Dickens expressed a distaste for certain aspects of organised religion. In 1836, in a pamphlet titled *Sunday Under Three Heads*, he defended the people's right to pleasure, opposing a plan to prohibit games on Sundays. \"Look into your churches – diminished congregations and scanty attendance. People have grown sullen and obstinate, and are becoming disgusted with the faith which condemns them to such a day as this, once in every seven. They display their feeling by staying away [from church]. Turn into the streets [on a Sunday] and mark the rigid gloom that reigns over everything around.\"[87][88]\n\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Dickens, c. 1850, National Library of Wales\nDickens honoured the figure of Jesus Christ.[89] He is regarded as a professing Christian.[90] His son, Henry Fielding Dickens, described him as someone who \"possessed deep religious convictions\". In the early 1840s, he had shown an interest in Unitarian Christianity and Robert Browning remarked that \"Mr Dickens is an enlightened Unitarian.\"[91] Professor Gary Colledge has written that he \"never strayed from his attachment to popular lay Anglicanism\".[92] Dickens authored a work called *The Life of Our Lord* (1846), a book about the life of Christ, written with the purpose of sharing his faith with his children and family.[93][94] In a scene from *David Copperfield*, Dickens echoed Geoffrey Chaucer's use of Luke 23:34 from *Troilus and Criseyde* (Dickens held a copy in his library), with G. K. Chesterton writing, \"among the great canonical English authors, Chaucer and Dickens have the most in common.\"[95]\n\n\nDickens disapproved of Roman Catholicism and 19th-century evangelicalism, seeing both as extremes of Christianity and likely to limit personal expression, and was critical of what he saw as the hypocrisy of religious institutions and philosophies like spiritualism, all of which he considered deviations from the true spirit of Christianity, as shown in the book he wrote for his family in 1846.[96][97] While Dickens advocated equal rights for Catholics in England, he strongly disliked how individual civil liberties were often threatened in countries where Catholicism predominated and referred to the Catholic Church as \"that curse upon the world.\"[96] Dickens also rejected the Evangelical conviction that the Bible was the infallible word of God. His ideas on Biblical interpretation were similar to the Liberal Anglican Arthur Penrhyn Stanley's doctrine of \"progressive revelation\".[96] Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky referred to Dickens as \"that great Christian writer\".[98][99]\n\n\n\n## Middle years[edit]\n\n\nIn December 1845, Dickens took up the editorship of the London-based *Daily News*, a liberal paper through which Dickens hoped to advocate, in his own words, \"the Principles of Progress and Improvement, of Education and Civil and Religious Liberty and Equal Legislation.\"[100] Among the other contributors Dickens chose to write for the paper were the radical economist Thomas Hodgskin and the social reformer Douglas William Jerrold, who frequently attacked the Corn Laws.[100][101] Dickens lasted only ten weeks on the job before resigning due to a combination of exhaustion and frustration with one of the paper's co-owners.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)David reaches Canterbury, from *David Copperfield*. The character incorporates many elements of Dickens's own life. Artwork by Frank Reynolds.\nA Francophile, Dickens often holidayed in France and, in a speech delivered in Paris in 1846 in French, called the French \"the first people in the universe\".[102] During his visit to Paris, Dickens met the French literati Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Eugène Scribe, Théophile Gautier, François-René de Chateaubriand and Eugène Sue.[102] In early 1849, Dickens started to write *David Copperfield*. It was published between 1849 and 1850. In Dickens's biography, *Life of Charles Dickens* (1872), John Forster wrote of *David Copperfield*, \"underneath the fiction lay something of the author's life\".[103] It was Dickens's personal favourite among his own novels, as he wrote in the author's preface to the 1867 edition of the novel.[104]\n\n\nIn late November 1851, Dickens moved into Tavistock House where he wrote *Bleak House* (1852–53), *Hard Times* (1854) and *Little Dorrit* (1856).[105] It was here that he indulged in the amateur theatricals described in Forster's *Life of Charles Dickens*.[106] During this period, he worked closely with the novelist and playwright Wilkie Collins. In 1856, his income from writing allowed him to buy Gads Hill Place in Higham, Kent. As a child, Dickens had walked past the house and dreamed of living in it. The area was also the scene of some of the events of Shakespeare's *Henry IV, Part 1* and this literary connection pleased him.[107]\n\n\nDuring this time Dickens was also the publisher, editor and a major contributor to the journals *Household Words* (1850–1859) and *All the Year Round* (1858–1870).[108] In 1854, at the behest of Sir John Franklin's widow Lady Jane, Dickens viciously attacked Arctic explorer John Rae in *Household Words* for his report to the Admiralty, based on interviews with local Inuit, that the members of Franklin's lost expedition had resorted to cannibalism. These attacks would later be expanded on his 1856 play *The Frozen Deep*, which satirizes Rae and the Inuit. 20th century archaeology work in King William Island later confirmed that the members of the Franklin expedition resorted to cannibalism.[109]\n\n\nIn 1855, when Dickens's good friend and Liberal MP Austen Henry Layard formed an Administrative Reform Association to demand significant reforms of Parliament, Dickens joined and volunteered his resources in support of Layard's cause.[110] With the exception of Lord John Russell, who was the only leading politician in whom Dickens had any faith and to whom he later dedicated *A Tale of Two Cities*, Dickens believed that the political aristocracy and their incompetence were the death of England.[111][110] When he and Layard were accused of fomenting class conflict, Dickens replied that the classes were already in opposition and the fault was with the aristocratic class. Dickens used his pulpit in *Household Words* to champion the Reform Association.[111] He also commented on foreign affairs, declaring his support for Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini, helping raise funds for their campaigns and stating that \"a united Italy would be of vast importance to the peace of the world, and would be a rock in Louis Napoleon's way,\" and that \"I feel for Italy almost as if I were an Italian born.\"[112][113][114] Dickens also published dozens of writings in *Household Words* supporting vaccination, including multiple laudations for vaccine pioneer Edward Jenner.[115]\n\n\nFollowing the Indian Mutiny of 1857, Dickens joined in the widespread criticism of the East India Company for its role in the event,[*citation needed*] but reserved his fury for Indians, wishing that he was the commander-in-chief in India so that he would be able to, \"do my utmost to exterminate the Race upon whom the stain of the late cruelties rested.\"[116]\n\n\n\n![](image)Actress Ellen Ternan in 1858. Dickens referred to Ternan as his \"magic circle of one\".\nIn 1857, Dickens hired professional actresses for *The Frozen Deep*, written by him and his protégé, Wilkie Collins. Dickens fell in love with one of the actresses, Ellen Ternan, and this passion was to last the rest of his life.[117] In 1858, when Dickens was 45 and Ternan 18, divorce was nearly unthinkable for someone as famous as he was. After publicly accusing Catherine of not loving their children and suffering from \"a mental disorder\" – statements that disgusted his contemporaries, including Elizabeth Barrett Browning –[118] Dickens attempted to have Catherine institutionalized.[119] When this scheme failed, they separated. When Catherine left, never to see her husband again, she took with her one child, leaving the other children to be raised by her sister Georgina, who chose to stay at Gads Hill.[71]\n\n\nDuring this period, whilst pondering a project to give public readings for his own profit, Dickens was approached through a charitable appeal by Great Ormond Street Hospital to help it survive its first major financial crisis. His \"Drooping Buds\" essay in *Household Words* earlier on 3 April 1852 was considered by the hospital's founders to have been the catalyst for the hospital's success.[120] Dickens, whose philanthropy was well-known, was asked by his friend, the hospital's founder Charles West, to preside over the appeal, and he threw himself into the task, heart and soul.[121] Dickens's public readings secured sufficient funds for an endowment to put the hospital on a sound financial footing; one reading on 9 February 1858 alone raised £3,000.[122][123][124]\n\n\n\n![](image)Dickens at his desk, 1858\nAfter separating from Catherine,[125] Dickens undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours which, together with his journalism, were to absorb most of his creative energies for the next decade, in which he was to write only two more novels.[126] His first reading tour, lasting from April 1858 to February 1859, consisted of 129 appearances in 49 towns throughout England, Scotland and Ireland.[127] Dickens's continued fascination with the theatrical world was written into the theatre scenes in *Nicholas Nickleby*, but more importantly he found an outlet in public readings. In 1866, he undertook a series of public readings in England and Scotland, with more the following year in England and Ireland.[128]\n\n\n\nFile:A Tale of Two Cities. The restaurant where Darnay is taken to \"restore himself\" after his liberation.jpegDickens was a regular patron at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese pub in London. He included the venue in *A Tale of Two Cities*.\nOther works soon followed, including *A Tale of Two Cities* (1859) and *Great Expectations* (1861), which were resounding successes. Set in London and Paris, *A Tale of Two Cities* is his best-known work of historical fiction and includes the famous opening sentence which begins with \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\" It is regularly cited as one of the best-selling novels of all time.[129][130] Themes in *Great Expectations* include wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil.[131]\n\n\nIn early September 1860, in a field behind Gads Hill, Dickens made a bonfire of most of his correspondence; only those letters on business matters were spared. Since Ellen Ternan also destroyed all of his letters to her,[132] the extent of the affair between the two remains speculative.[133] In the 1930s, Thomas Wright recounted that Ternan had unburdened herself to a Canon Benham and gave currency to rumours they had been lovers.[134] That the two had a son who died in infancy was alleged by Dickens's daughter, Kate Perugini, whom Gladys Storey had interviewed before her death in 1929. Storey published her account in *Dickens and Daughter*,[135][136] but no contemporary evidence exists. On his death, Dickens settled an annuity on Ternan which made her financially independent. Claire Tomalin's book *The Invisible Woman* argues that Ternan lived with Dickens secretly for the last 13 years of his life. The book was subsequently turned into a play, *Little Nell*, by Simon Gray, and a 2013 film. During the same period Dickens furthered his interest in the paranormal becoming one of the early members of The Ghost Club.[137]\n\n\nIn June 1862, he was offered £10,000 for a reading tour of Australia.[138] He was enthusiastic, and even planned a travel book, *The Uncommercial Traveller Upside Down*, but ultimately decided against the tour.[139] Two of his sons, Alfred D'Orsay Tennyson Dickens and Edward Bulwer Lytton Dickens, migrated to Australia, Edward becoming a member of the Parliament of New South Wales as Member for Wilcannia between 1889 and 1894.[140][141]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aftermath of the Staplehurst rail crash in 1865\nOn 9 June 1865, while returning from Paris with Ellen Ternan, Dickens was involved in the Staplehurst rail crash in Kent. The train's first seven carriages plunged off a cast iron bridge that was under repair. The only first-class carriage to remain on the track was the one in which Dickens was travelling. Before rescuers arrived, Dickens tended and comforted the wounded and the dying with a flask of brandy and a hat refreshed with water, and saved some lives. Before leaving, he remembered the unfinished manuscript for *Our Mutual Friend*, and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it.[142]\n\n\nDickens later used the experience of the crash as material for his short ghost story, \"The Signal-Man\", in which the central character has a premonition of his own death in a rail crash. He also based the story on several previous rail accidents, such as the Clayton Tunnel rail crash in Sussex of 1861. Dickens managed to avoid an appearance at the inquest to avoid disclosing that he had been travelling with Ternan and her mother, which would have caused a scandal.[143] After the crash, Dickens was nervous when travelling by train and would use alternative means when available.[144] In 1868 he wrote, \"I have sudden vague rushes of terror, even when riding in a hansom cab, which are perfectly unreasonable but quite insurmountable.\" Dickens's son, Henry, recalled, \"I have seen him sometimes in a railway carriage when there was a slight jolt. When this happened he was almost in a state of panic and gripped the seat with both hands.\"[144]\n\n\n\n### Second visit to the United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crowd of spectators buying tickets for a Dickens reading at Steinway Hall, New York City in 1867\nWhile he contemplated a second visit to the United States, the outbreak of the Civil War in America in 1861 delayed his plans. On 9 November 1867, over two years after the war, Dickens set sail from Liverpool for his second American reading tour. Landing in Boston, he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his American publisher, James T. Fields. In early December, the readings began. He performed 76 readings, netting £19,000, from December 1867 to April 1868.[145] Dickens shuttled between Boston and New York, where he gave 22 readings at Steinway Hall. Although he had started to suffer from what he called the \"true American catarrh\", he kept to a schedule that would have challenged a much younger man, even managing to squeeze in some sleighing in Central Park.[146]\n\n\n\nDuring his travels, he saw a change in the people and the circumstances of America. His final appearance was at a banquet the American Press held in his honour at Delmonico's on 18 April, when he promised never to denounce America again. By the end of the tour Dickens could hardly manage solid food, subsisting on champagne and eggs beaten in sherry. On 23 April he boarded the Cunard liner *Russia* to return to Britain,[147] barely escaping a federal tax lien against the proceeds of his lecture tour.[148]\n\n\n### Farewell readings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Poster promoting a reading by Dickens in Nottingham dated 4 February 1869, two months before he had a mild stroke\nIn 1868–69, Dickens gave a series of \"farewell readings\" in England, Scotland and Ireland, beginning on 6 October. He managed, of a contracted 100 readings, to give 75 in the provinces, with a further 12 in London.[145] As he pressed on he was affected by giddiness and fits of paralysis. He had a stroke on 18 April 1869 in Chester.[149] He collapsed on 22 April 1869, at Preston, Lancashire; on doctor's advice, the tour was cancelled.[150] After further provincial readings were cancelled, he began work on his final novel, *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*. It was fashionable in the 1860s to 'do the slums' and, in company, Dickens visited opium dens in Shadwell, where he witnessed an elderly addict called \"Laskar Sal\", who formed the model for \"Opium Sal\" in *Edwin Drood*.[151]\n\n\nAfter Dickens regained enough strength, he arranged, with medical approval, for a final series of readings to partly make up to his sponsors what they had lost due to his illness. There were 12 performances, on 11 January to 15 March 1870; the last at 8:00pm at St. James's Hall, London. Though in grave health by then, he read *A Christmas Carol* and *The Trial from Pickwick*. On 2 May, he made his last public appearance at a Royal Academy banquet in the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, paying a special tribute on the death of his friend, illustrator Daniel Maclise.[152]\n\n\n\n### Death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nSamuel Luke Fildes *– The Empty Chair*. Fildes was illustrating *Edwin Drood* at the time of Dickens's death. The engraving shows Dickens's empty chair in his study at Gads Hill Place. It appeared in the Christmas 1870 edition of *The Graphic* and thousands of prints of it were sold.[153]\n![](image)\nDickens's grave in Westminster Abbey\n![](image)\nA 1905 transcribed copy of the death certificate of Charles Dickens\n\nOn 8 June 1870, Dickens had another stroke at his home after a full day's work on *Edwin Drood*. He never regained consciousness and, the next day, he died at Gads Hill Place. Biographer Claire Tomalin has suggested Dickens was actually in Peckham when he had had the stroke and his mistress Ellen Ternan and her maids had him taken back to Gads Hill so that the public would not know the truth about their relationship.[154] Contrary to his wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral \"in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner\",[155] he was laid to rest in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads:\n\n\n\n\n> To the Memory of Charles Dickens (England's most popular author) who died at his residence, Higham, near Rochester, Kent, 9 June 1870, aged 58 years. He was a sympathiser with the poor, the suffering, and the oppressed; and by his death, one of England's greatest writers is lost to the world.[156]\n> \n> \n\n\nA letter from Dickens to the Clerk of the Privy Council in March indicates he'd been offered and had accepted a baronetcy, which was not gazetted before his death.[157] His last words were \"On the ground\", in response to his sister-in-law Georgina's request that he lie down.[158][nb 2] On Sunday, 19 June 1870, five days after Dickens was buried in the Abbey, Dean Arthur Penrhyn Stanley delivered a memorial elegy, lauding \"the genial and loving humorist whom we now mourn\", for showing by his own example \"that even in dealing with the darkest scenes and the most degraded characters, genius could still be clean, and mirth could be innocent\". Pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelist's grave, Stanley assured those present that \"the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one with both the New World and the Old, as that of the representative of literature, not of this island only, but of all who speak our English tongue.\"[159]\n\n\nIn his will, drafted more than a year before his death, Dickens left the care of his £80,000 estate (£9,668,700 in 2023)[160] to his long-time colleague John Forster and his \"best and truest friend\" Georgina Hogarth who, along with Dickens's two sons, also received a tax-free sum of £8,000 (equivalent to £967,000 in 2023).[160] Although Dickens and his wife had been separated for several years at the time of his death, he provided her with an annual income of £600 (£72,500 in 2023)[160] and made her similar allowances in his will. He also bequeathed £19 19s (£2,400 in 2023)[160] to each servant in his employment at the time of his death.[161]\n\n\n\n## Literary style[edit]\n\n\nDickens's approach to the novel is influenced by various things, including the picaresque novel tradition,[162] melodrama[163] and the novel of sensibility.[164] According to Ackroyd, other than these, perhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the fables of *The Arabian Nights*.[165] Satire and irony are central to the picaresque novel.[166] Comedy is also an aspect of the British picaresque novel tradition of Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett. Fielding's *Tom Jones* was a major influence on the 19th-century novelist including Dickens, who read it in his youth[167] and named a son Henry Fielding Dickens after him.[168][169] Influenced by Gothic fiction—a literary genre that began with *The Castle of Otranto* (1764) by Horace Walpole—Dickens incorporated Gothic imagery, settings and plot devices in his works.[170] Victorian gothic moved from castles and abbeys into contemporary urban environments: in particular London, such as Dickens's *Oliver Twist* and *Bleak House*. The jilted bride Miss Havisham from *Great Expectations* is one of Dickens's best-known gothic creations; living in a ruined mansion, her bridal gown effectively doubles as her funeral shroud.[171]\n\n\nNo other writer had such a profound influence on Dickens as William Shakespeare. On Dickens's veneration of Shakespeare, Alfred Harbage wrote in *A Kind of Power: The Shakespeare-Dickens Analogy* (1975) that \"No one is better qualified to recognise literary genius than a literary genius\".[172] Regarding Shakespeare as \"the great master\" whose plays \"were an unspeakable source of delight\", Dickens's lifelong affinity with the playwright included seeing theatrical productions of his plays in London and putting on amateur dramatics with friends in his early years.[172] In 1838, Dickens travelled to Stratford-upon-Avon and visited the house in which Shakespeare was born, leaving his autograph in the visitors' book. Dickens would draw on this experience in his next work, *Nicholas Nickleby* (1838–39), expressing the strength of feeling experienced by visitors to Shakespeare's birthplace: the character Mrs Wititterly states, \"I don't know how it is, but after you've seen the place and written your name in the little book, somehow or other you seem to be inspired; it kindles up quite a fire within one.\"[173]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Dickens's Dream* by Robert William Buss, portraying Dickens at his desk at Gads Hill Place surrounded by many of his characters\nDickens's writing style is marked by a profuse linguistic creativity.[174] Satire, flourishing in his gift for caricature, is his forte. An early reviewer compared him to Hogarth for his keen practical sense of the ludicrous side of life, though his acclaimed mastery of varieties of class idiom may in fact mirror the conventions of contemporary popular theatre.[175] Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving what one critic calls an \"allegorical impetus\" to the novels' meanings.[174] To cite one of numerous examples, the name Mr Murdstone in *David Copperfield* conjures up twin allusions to murder and stony coldness.[176] His literary style is also a mixture of fantasy and realism. His satires of British aristocratic snobbery – he calls one character the \"Noble Refrigerator\" – are often popular. Comparing orphans to stocks and shares, people to tug boats or dinner-party guests to furniture are just some of Dickens's acclaimed flights of fancy.\n\n\nThe author worked closely with his illustrators, supplying them with a summary of the work at the outset and thus ensuring that his characters and settings were exactly how he envisioned them. He briefed the illustrator on plans for each month's instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them. Marcus Stone, illustrator of *Our Mutual Friend*, recalled that the author was always \"ready to describe down to the minutest details the personal characteristics, and ... life-history of the creations of his fancy\".[177] Dickens employs Cockney English in many of his works, denoting working-class Londoners. Cockney grammar appears in terms such as ain't, and consonants in words are frequently omitted, as in 'ere (here) and wot (what).[178] An example of this usage is in *Oliver Twist*. The Artful Dodger uses cockney slang which is juxtaposed with Oliver's 'proper' English, when the Dodger repeats Oliver saying \"seven\" with \"sivin\".[179]\n\n\n\n### Characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Old Curiosity Shop in Holborn, London, which inspired *The Old Curiosity Shop*. Many of Dickens's works do not just use London as a backdrop; they are also about the city and its character.\nDickens's biographer Claire Tomalin regards him as the greatest creator of character in English fiction after Shakespeare.[180]\nDickensian characters are amongst the most memorable in English literature, especially so because of their typically whimsical names. The likes of Ebenezer Scrooge, Tiny Tim, Jacob Marley and Bob Cratchit (*A Christmas Carol*); Oliver Twist, The Artful Dodger, Fagin and Bill Sikes (*Oliver Twist*); Pip, Miss Havisham and Abel Magwitch (*Great Expectations*); Sydney Carton, Charles Darnay and Madame Defarge (*A Tale of Two Cities*); David Copperfield, Uriah Heep and Mr Micawber (*David Copperfield*); Daniel Quilp and Nell Trent (*The Old Curiosity Shop*), Samuel Pickwick and Sam Weller (*The Pickwick Papers*); and Wackford Squeers (*Nicholas Nickleby*) are so well known as to be part and parcel of popular culture, and in some cases have passed into ordinary language: a *scrooge*, for example, is a miser or someone who dislikes Christmas festivity.[181]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Artful Dodger from *Oliver Twist*. His dialect is rooted in Cockney English.\nHis characters were often so memorable that they took on a life of their own outside his books. \"Gamp\" became a slang expression for an umbrella from the character Mrs Gamp, and \"Pickwickian\", \"Pecksniffian\" and \"Gradgrind\" all entered dictionaries due to Dickens's original portraits of such characters who were, respectively, quixotic, hypocritical and vapidly factual. The character that made Dickens famous, Sam Weller became known for his Wellerisms—one-liners that turned proverbs on their heads.[49] Many were drawn from real life: Mrs Nickleby is based on his mother, although she did not recognise herself in the portrait,[182] just as Mr Micawber is constructed from aspects of his father's 'rhetorical exuberance';[183] Harold Skimpole in *Bleak House* is based on James Henry Leigh Hunt; his wife's dwarfish chiropodist recognised herself in Miss Mowcher in *David Copperfield*.[184][185] Perhaps Dickens's impressions on his meeting with Hans Christian Andersen informed the delineation of Uriah Heep (a term synonymous with sycophant).[186]\n\n\nVirginia Woolf maintained that \"we remodel our psychological geography when we read Dickens\" as he produces \"characters who exist not in detail, not accurately or exactly, but abundantly in a cluster of wild yet extraordinarily revealing remarks\".[187] T. S. Eliot wrote that Dickens \"excelled in character; in the creation of characters of greater intensity than human beings\".[188] One \"character\" vividly drawn throughout his novels is London itself.[189] Dickens described London as a magic lantern, inspiring the places and people in many of his novels.[190] From the coaching inns on the outskirts of the city to the lower reaches of the Thames, all aspects of the capital – Dickens's London – are described over the course of his body of work.[190] Walking the streets (particularly around London) formed an integral part of his writing life, stoking his creativity. Dickens was known to regularly walk at least a dozen miles (19 km) per day, and once wrote, \"If I couldn't walk fast and far, I should just explode and perish.\"[191]\n\n\n\n### Autobiographical elements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An original illustration by Phiz from the novel *David Copperfield*, which is widely regarded as Dickens's most autobiographical work\nAuthors frequently draw their portraits of characters from people they have known in real life. *David Copperfield* is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in *Bleak House* reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright.[192] Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in *Little Dorrit* resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution.[193] Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in *David Copperfield* and Lucie Manette in *A Tale of Two Cities*.[194][nb 3]\n\n\nDickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody.[195]\n\n\n\n### Episodic writing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Advertisement for *Great Expectations*, serialised in the weekly literary magazine *All the Year Round* from December 1860 to August 1861. The advert contains the plot device \"to be continued\".\nA pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction, Dickens wrote most of his major novels in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as *Master Humphrey's Clock* and *Household Words*, later reprinted in book form.[4][5] These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, with the audience more evenly distributed across income levels than previous.[196] His instalment format inspired a narrative that he would explore and develop throughout his career, and the regular cliffhangers made each new episode widely anticipated.[6][196] When *The Old Curiosity Shop* was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in New York harbour, shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, \"Is little Nell dead?\"[197] Dickens was able to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end.\n\n\nAnother important impact of Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation; he toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in *The Old Curiosity Shop*), and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in *Oliver Twist*. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine.[198]\n\n\nAt the helm in popularising cliffhangers and serial publications in Victorian literature,[199] Dickens's influence can also be seen in television soap operas and film series, with *The Guardian* stating that \"the DNA of Dickens's busy, episodic storytelling, delivered in instalments and rife with cliffhangers and diversions, is traceable in everything.\"[200] His serialisation of his novels also drew comments from other writers. In Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson's novel *The Wrecker*, Captain Nares, investigating an abandoned ship, remarked: \"See! They were writing up the log,\" said Nares, pointing to the ink-bottle. \"Caught napping, as usual. I wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels.\"[201]\n\n\n\n### Social commentary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nurse Sarah Gamp (left) from *Martin Chuzzlewit* became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of Florence Nightingale.\nDickens's novels were, among other things, works of social commentary. Simon Callow states, \"From the moment he started to write, he spoke for the people, and the people loved him for it.\"[202] He was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of Victorian society. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that \"Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen\".[203] Dickens's second novel, *Oliver Twist* (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed.[204][205]\n\n\nAt a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world, Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society. Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues – such as sanitation and the workhouse – but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist, but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of this condition is in *Hard Times* (1854), Dickens's only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class. In this work, he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed \"Hands\" by the factory owners; that is, not really \"people\" but rather only appendages of the machines they operated. His writings inspired others, in particular journalists and political figures, to address such problems of class oppression. For example, the prison scenes in *The Pickwick Papers* are claimed to have been influential in having the Fleet Prison shut down. Karl Marx asserted that Dickens \"issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together\".[206] George Bernard Shaw even remarked that *Great Expectations* was more seditious than Marx's *Das Kapital*.[206] The exceptional popularity of Dickens's novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (*Bleak House*, 1853; *Little Dorrit*, 1857; *Our Mutual Friend*, 1865), not only underscored his ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored.\n\n\nIt has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an 'unruly superfluity of material' that, in the gradual dénouement, yields up an unsuspected order, influenced the organisation of Charles Darwin's *On the Origin of Species*.[207]\n\n\n\n### Literary techniques[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bleak House (pictured in the 1920s) in Broadstairs, Kent, where Dickens wrote some of his novels\n![](image)Dickens's chalet in Rochester, Kent where he was writing the last chapters of *Edwin Drood* the day before he died\nDickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in *The Old Curiosity Shop* (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by Oscar Wilde. \"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell\", he said in a famous remark, \"without dissolving into tears ... of laughter.\"[208][209] G. K. Chesterton stated, \"It is not the death of little Nell, but the life of little Nell, that I object to\", arguing that the maudlin effect of his description of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of Dickens's grief, his \"despotic\" use of people's feelings to move them to tears in works like this.[210]\n\n\nThe question as to whether Dickens belongs to the tradition of the sentimental novel is debatable. Valerie Purton, in her book *Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition*, sees him continuing aspects of this tradition, and argues that his \"sentimental scenes and characters [are] as crucial to the overall power of the novels as his darker or comic figures and scenes\", and that \"*Dombey and Son* is [ ... ] Dickens's greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition\".[211] The *Encyclopædia Britannica* online comments that, despite \"patches of emotional excess\", such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in *A Christmas Carol* (1843), \"Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist\".[212]\n\n\nIn *Oliver Twist* Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young pickpockets. While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in *Bleak House* and Amy Dorrit in *Little Dorrit*), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's goal of poignant social commentary. Dickens's fiction, reflecting what he believed to be true of his own life, makes frequent use of coincidence, either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence.[213] For example, Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group. Such coincidences are a staple of 18th-century picaresque novels, such as Henry Fielding's *Tom Jones,* which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth.[214]\n\n\n\n## Reputation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dickens's portrait (top left), in between Shakespeare and Tennyson, on a stained glass window at the Ottawa Public Library, Ottawa, Canada\nDickens was the most popular novelist of his time,[215] and remains one of the best-known and most-read of English authors. His works have never gone out of print,[216] and have been adapted continually for the screen since the invention of cinema,[217] with at least 200 motion pictures and TV adaptations based on Dickens's works documented.[218] Many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own lifetime – early productions included *The Haunted Man* which was performed in the West End's Adelphi Theatre in 1848 – and, as early as 1901, the British silent film *Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost* was made by Walter R. Booth.[219] Contemporaries such as publisher Edward Lloyd cashed in on Dickens's popularity with cheap imitations of his novels, resulting in his own popular 'penny dreadfuls'.[220]\n\n\nDickens created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest British novelist of the Victorian era.[1] From the beginning of his career in the 1830s, his achievements in English literature were compared to those of Shakespeare.[172] Dickens's literary reputation, however, began to decline with the publication of *Bleak House* in 1852–53. Philip Collins calls *Bleak House* \"a crucial item in the history of Dickens's reputation. Reviewers and literary figures during the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s, saw a 'drear decline' in Dickens, from a writer of 'bright sunny comedy ... to dark and serious social' commentary\".[221] *The Spectator* called *Bleak House* \"a heavy book to read through at once ... dull and wearisome as a serial\"; Richard Simpson, in *The Rambler*, characterised *Hard Times* as \"this dreary framework\"; *Fraser's Magazine* thought *Little Dorrit* \"decidedly the worst of his novels\".[222] All the same, despite these \"increasing reservations amongst reviewers and the chattering classes, 'the public never deserted its favourite'\". Dickens's popular reputation remained unchanged, sales continued to rise, and *Household Words* and later *All the Year Round* were highly successful.[222]\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Charles Dickens as he appears when reading.\" Wood engraving from *Harper's Weekly*, 7 December 1867. Author David Lodge called Dickens the \"first writer to be an object of unrelenting public interest and adulation\".[223]\nAs his career progressed, Dickens's fame and the demand for his public readings were unparalleled. In 1868 *The Times* wrote, \"Amid all the variety of 'readings', those of Mr Charles Dickens stand alone.\"[10] A Dickens biographer, Edgar Johnson, wrote in the 1950s: \"It was [always] more than a reading; it was an extraordinary exhibition of acting that seized upon its auditors with a mesmeric possession.\"[10] Juliet John backed the claim for Dickens \"to be called the first self-made global media star of the age of mass culture.\"[223] Comparing his reception at public readings to those of a contemporary pop star, *The Guardian* states, \"People sometimes fainted at his shows. His performances even saw the rise of that modern phenomenon, the 'speculator' or ticket tout (scalpers) – the ones in New York City escaped detection by borrowing respectable-looking hats from the waiters in nearby restaurants.\"[224]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"Dickens's vocal impersonations of his own characters gave this truth a theatrical form: the public reading tour. No other Victorian could match him for celebrity, earnings, and sheer vocal artistry. The Victorians craved the author's multiple voices: between 1853 and his death in 1870, Dickens performed about 470 times.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Peter Garratt in *The Guardian* on Dickens's fame and the demand for his public readings[10]\n\nAmong fellow writers, there was a range of opinions on Dickens. Poet laureate, William Wordsworth (1770–1850), thought him a \"very talkative, vulgar young person\", adding he had not read a line of his work, while novelist George Meredith (1828–1909), found Dickens \"intellectually lacking\".[225] In 1888, Leslie Stephen commented in the *Dictionary of National Biography* that \"if literary fame could be safely measured by popularity with the half-educated, Dickens must claim the highest position among English novelists\".[226] Anthony Trollope's *Autobiography* famously declared Thackeray, not Dickens, to be the greatest novelist of the age. However, both Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky were admirers. Dostoyevsky commented: \"We understand Dickens in Russia, I am convinced, almost as well as the English, perhaps even with all the nuances. It may well be that we love him no less than his compatriots do. And yet how original is Dickens, and how very English!\"[227] Tolstoy referred to *David Copperfield* as his favourite book, and he later adopted the novel as \"a model for his own autobiographical reflections\".[228] French writer Jules Verne called Dickens his favourite writer, writing his novels \"stand alone, dwarfing all others by their amazing power and felicity of expression\".[229] Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh was inspired by Dickens's novels in several of his paintings, such as *Vincent's Chair*, and in an 1889 letter to his sister stated that reading Dickens, especially *A Christmas Carol*, was one of the things that was keeping him from committing suicide.[230] Oscar Wilde generally disparaged his depiction of character, while admiring his gift for caricature.[231] Henry James denied him a premier position, calling him \"the greatest of superficial novelists\": Dickens failed to endow his characters with psychological depth, and the novels, \"loose baggy monsters\",[232] betrayed a \"cavalier organisation\".[233] Joseph Conrad described his own childhood in bleak Dickensian terms, noting he had \"an intense and unreasoning affection\" for *Bleak House* dating back to his boyhood. The novel influenced his own gloomy portrait of London in *The Secret Agent* (1907).[228] Virginia Woolf had a love-hate relationship with Dickens, finding his novels \"mesmerizing\" while reproving him for his sentimentalism and a commonplace style.[234]\n\n\nAround 1940–41, the attitude of the literary critics began to warm towards Dickens – led by George Orwell in *Inside the Whale and Other Essays* (March 1940), Edmund Wilson in *The Wound and the Bow* (1941) and Humphry House in *Dickens and His World*.[235] However, even in 1948, F. R. Leavis, in *The Great Tradition*, asserted that \"the adult mind doesn't as a rule find in Dickens a challenge to an unusual and sustained seriousness\"; Dickens was indeed a great genius, \"but the genius was that of a great entertainer\",[236] though he later changed his opinion with *Dickens the Novelist* (1970, with Q. D. (Queenie) Leavis): \"Our purpose\", they wrote, \"is to enforce as unanswerably as possible the conviction that Dickens was one of the greatest of creative writers\".[237] In 1944, Soviet film director and film theorist Sergei Eisenstein wrote an essay on Dickens's influence on cinema, such as cross-cutting – where two stories run alongside each other, as seen in novels such as *Oliver Twist*.[238]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, \"a substantial reassessment and re-editing of the works began, and critics found his finest artistry and greatest depth to be in the later novels: *Bleak House*, *Little Dorrit*, and *Great Expectations* – and (less unanimously) in *Hard Times* and *Our Mutual Friend*\".[239] Dickens was a favourite author of Roald Dahl; the best-selling children's author would include three of Dickens's novels among those read by the title character in his 1988 novel *Matilda*.[240] An avid reader of Dickens, in 2005, Paul McCartney named *Nicholas Nickleby* his favourite novel. On Dickens he states, \"I like the world that he takes me to. I like his words; I like the language\", adding, \"A lot of my stuff – it's kind of Dickensian.\"[241] Screenwriter Jonathan Nolan's screenplay for *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012) was inspired by *A Tale of Two Cities*, with Nolan calling the depiction of Paris in the novel \"one of the most harrowing portraits of a relatable, recognisable civilisation that completely folded to pieces\".[242] On 7 February 2012, the 200th anniversary of Dickens's birth, Philip Womack wrote in *The Telegraph*: \"Today there is no escaping Charles Dickens. Not that there has ever been much chance of that before. He has a deep, peculiar hold upon us\".[243]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Dickens and Little Nell* statue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nMuseums and festivals celebrating Dickens's life and works exist in many places with which Dickens was associated. These include the Charles Dickens Museum in London, the historic home where he wrote *Oliver Twist*, *The Pickwick Papers* and *Nicholas Nickleby*; and the Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth, the house in which he was born. The original manuscripts of many of his novels, as well as printers' proofs, first editions, and illustrations from the collection of Dickens's friend John Forster are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum.[244] Dickens's will stipulated that no memorial be erected in his honour; nonetheless, a life-size bronze statue of Dickens entitled *Dickens and Little Nell*, cast in 1890 by Francis Edwin Elwell, stands in Clark Park in the Spruce Hill neighbourhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Another life-size statue of Dickens is located at Centennial Park in Sydney, Australia.[245] In 1960 a bas-relief sculpture of Dickens, notably featuring characters from his books, was commissioned from sculptor Estcourt J Clack to adorn the office building built on the site of his former home at 1 Devonshire Terrace, London.[246][*page needed*][247] In 2014, a life-size statue was unveiled near his birthplace in Portsmouth on the 202nd anniversary of his birth; this was supported by his great-great-grandsons, Ian and Gerald Dickens.[248][249]\n\n\n\n![](image)*A Christmas Carol* significantly influenced the modern celebration of Christmas in many countries\n*A Christmas Carol* is most probably his best-known story, with frequent new adaptations. It is also the most-filmed of Dickens's stories, with many versions dating from the early years of cinema.[250] According to the historian Ronald Hutton, the current state of the observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid-Victorian revival of the holiday spearheaded by *A Christmas Carol*. Dickens catalysed the emerging Christmas as a family-centred festival of generosity, in contrast to the dwindling community-based and church-centred observations, as new middle-class expectations arose.[251] Its archetypal figures (Scrooge, Tiny Tim, the Christmas ghosts) entered into Western cultural consciousness. \"Merry Christmas\", a prominent phrase from the tale, was popularised following the appearance of the story.[252] The term Scrooge became a synonym for miser, and his exclamation \"Bah! Humbug!'\", a dismissal of the festive spirit, likewise gained currency as an idiom.[253] The Victorian era novelist William Makepeace Thackeray called the book \"a national benefit, and to every man and woman who reads it a personal kindness\".[250]\n\n\nDickens was commemorated on the Series E £10 note issued by the Bank of England that circulated between 1992 and 2003. His portrait appeared on the reverse of the note accompanied by a scene from *The Pickwick Papers*. The Charles Dickens School is a high school in Broadstairs, Kent. A theme park, Dickens World, standing in part on the site of the former naval dockyard where Dickens's father once worked in the Navy Pay Office, opened in Chatham in 2007. To celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens in 2012, the Museum of London held the UK's first major exhibition on the author in 40 years.[254] In 2002, Dickens was number 41 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[255] American literary critic Harold Bloom placed Dickens among the greatest Western writers of all time.[256] In the 2003 UK survey The Big Read carried out by the BBC, five of Dickens's books were named in the Top 100.[257]\n\n\nActors who have portrayed Dickens on screen include Anthony Hopkins, Derek Jacobi, Simon Callow, Dan Stevens and Ralph Fiennes, the latter playing the author in *The Invisible Woman* (2013) which depicts Dickens's secret love affair with Ellen Ternan which lasted for thirteen years until his death in 1870.[258]\n\n\nDickens and his publications have appeared on a number of postage stamps in countries including: the United Kingdom (1970, 1993, 2011 and 2012 issued by the Royal Mail—their 2012 collection marked the bicentenary of Dickens's birth),[259] the Soviet Union (1962), Antigua, Barbuda, Botswana, Cameroon, Dubai, Fujairah, St Lucia and Turks and Caicos Islands (1970), St Vincent (1987), Nevis (2007), Alderney, Gibraltar, Jersey and Pitcairn Islands (2012), Austria (2013), and Mozambique (2014).[260] In 1976, a crater on the planet Mercury was named in his honour.[261]\n\n\nIn November 2018 it was reported that a previously lost portrait of a 31-year-old Dickens, by Margaret Gillies, had been found in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Gillies was an early supporter of women's suffrage and had painted the portrait in late 1843 when Dickens, aged 31, wrote *A Christmas Carol*. It was exhibited, to acclaim, at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1844.[80] The Charles Dickens Museum is reported to have paid £180,000 for the portrait.[262]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Charles Dickens bibliography\n\nDickens published well over a dozen major novels and novellas, a large number of short stories, including a number of Christmas-themed stories, a handful of plays, and several non-fiction books.\n\n\n\n### Novels and novellas[edit]\n\n\nDickens's novels and novellas were initially serialised in weekly and monthly magazines, then reprinted in standard book formats.\n\n\n\n* *The Pickwick Papers* (*The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club*; monthly serial, April 1836 to November 1837).[263] Novel.\n* *Oliver Twist* (*The Adventures of Oliver Twist*; monthly serial in *Bentley's Miscellany*, February 1837 to April 1839).

I am willing ... to concede that I had not arrived at man's estate when Grimaldi left the stage\".[19] When Dickens arrived in America for the first time in 1842, he stayed at the Tremont House, America's \"pioneer first-class hotel\". Dickens \"bounded into the Tremont's foyer shouting out 'Here we are!', Grimaldi's famous catch-phrase and as such entirely appropriate for a great and cherished entertainer making his entrance upon a new stage.\"[20] Later, Dickens was known to imitate Grimaldi's clowning on several occasions.[21]\n2. **^** A contemporary obituary in *The Times*, alleged that Dickens's last words were: \"Be natural my children. For the writer that is natural has fulfilled all the rules of Art.\" Reprinted from *The Times*, London, August 1870 in Bidwell 1870, p. 223.\n3. **^** Slater also detects Ellen Ternan in the portrayal of Lucie Manette.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Black 2007, p. 735.\n2. **^** Mazzeno 2008, p. 76.\n3. **^** Chesterton 2005, pp. 100–126.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Grossman 2012, p. 54\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Lodge 2002, p. 118.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Tune in next week\". *The New Yorker*. 2 December 2017.

He received several prestigious literary awards for his novella *The Little Prince* (*Le Petit Prince*) and for his lyrical aviation writings, including *Wind, Sand and Stars* and *Night Flight*. They were translated into many languages.\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry was a successful commercial pilot before World War II, working airmail routes in Europe, Africa, and South America. He joined the French Air Force at the start of the war, flying reconnaissance missions until France's armistice with Germany in 1940. After being demobilised by the French Air Force, he travelled to the United States to help persuade its government to enter the war against Nazi Germany.\n\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry spent 28 months in the United States of America, during which he wrote three of his most important works, then joined the Free French Air Force in North Africa, even though he was far past the maximum age for such pilots and in declining health. He disappeared and is believed to have died while on a reconnaissance mission from the French island of Corsica over the Mediterranean on 31 July 1944.[6] Although the wreckage of his plane was discovered off the coast of Marseille in 2000, the ultimate cause of the crash remains unknown.[7]\n\n\n## Youth and aviation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Coat of arms of the de Saint-Exupéry family since the 18th century.![](image)Birthplace of Saint-Exupéry in the Presqu'île section of Lyon, on the street now named after him, in blue at lower left.\nSaint-Exupéry was born in Lyon to an aristocratic Catholic family that could trace its lineage back several centuries, whose name ultimately references the 5th-century bishop Saint Exuperius. He was the third of five children of the Viscountess Marie de Fonscolombe and Viscount Jean de Saint-Exupéry (1863–1904).[8][9][10][Note 1] His father, an executive of the *Le Soleil* (The Sun) insurance brokerage, died of a stroke in the train station of La Foux before his son's fourth birthday. His father's death affected the entire family, transforming their status to that of \"impoverished aristocrats\".[12]\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry had three sisters and a younger blond-haired brother, François, who at age 15 died of rheumatic fever contracted while both were attending the Marianist College Villa St. Jean in Fribourg, Switzerland, during World War I. Saint-Exupéry attended to his brother, his closest confidant, beside François' death bed, and later wrote that François \"...remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a [young] tree falls\", imagery which would much later be recrafted into the climactic ending of *The Little Prince*. At the age of 17, now the only male in the family following the death of his brother, the young author was left as distraught as his mother and sisters, but he soon assumed the mantle of a protector and took to consoling them.[13]\n\n\nAfter twice failing his final exams at a preparatory Naval Academy, Saint-Exupéry entered the École des Beaux-Arts as an auditor to study architecture for 15 months, again without graduating, and then fell into the habit of accepting odd jobs. In 1921, Saint-Exupéry began his military service as a basic-rank soldier with the *2e Régiment de chasseurs à cheval* (2nd Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment) and was sent to Neuhof, near Strasbourg.[14] While there he took private flying lessons and the following year was offered a transfer from the French Army to the French Air Force. He received his pilot's wings after being posted to the 37th Fighter Regiment in Casablanca, Morocco.\n\n\nLater, being reposted to the 34th Aviation Regiment at Le Bourget on the outskirts of Paris, and then experiencing the first of his many aircraft crashes, Saint-Exupéry bowed to the objections of the family of his fiancée, future novelist Louise Lévêque de Vilmorin, and left the air force to take an office job. The couple ultimately broke off their engagement and he worked at several more odd jobs without success over the next few years.[15]\n\n\nBy 1926, Saint-Exupéry was flying again. He became one of the pioneers of international postal flight, in the days when aircraft had few instruments. Later he complained that those who flew the more advanced aircraft had become more like accountants than pilots. He worked for Aéropostale between Toulouse and Dakar, and then also became the airline stopover manager for the Cape Juby airfield in the Spanish zone of South Morocco, in the Sahara desert. His duties included negotiating the safe release of downed fliers taken hostage by Saharan tribes, a perilous task that earned him his first Légion d'honneur from the French Government.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1929, Saint-Exupéry was transferred to Argentina, where he was appointed director of the Aeroposta Argentina airline. He lived in Buenos Aires, in the Galería Güemes building. He surveyed new air routes across South America, negotiated agreements, and even occasionally flew the airmail as well as search missions looking for downed fliers. This period of his life is briefly explored in *Wings of Courage*, an IMAX film by French director Jean-Jacques Annaud.[16]\n\n\n\n## Writing career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saint-Exupéry photographed near Montréal, Québec, in May 1942, on a speaking tour in support of France after its armistice with Germany. Despite his appearance, he had been beleaguered with stress and bedridden with cholecystitis.[17][18]\nSaint-Exupéry's first novella, *L'Aviateur* (*The Aviator*), was published in 1926 in a short-lived literary magazine *Le Navire d'Argent* (*The Silver Ship*).[19] In 1929, his first book, *Courrier Sud* (*Southern Mail*) was published; his career as an aviator and journalist was about to begin. That same year, Saint-Exupéry flew the Casablanca—Dakar route.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe 1931 publication of *Vol de nuit* (*Night Flight*) established Saint-Exupéry as a rising star in the literary world. It was the first of his major works to gain widespread acclaim and won the prix Femina. The novel mirrored his experiences as a mail pilot and director of the Aeroposta Argentina airline, based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.[20] That same year, at Grasse, Saint-Exupéry married Consuelo Suncin (née Suncín Sandoval), a once-divorced, once-widowed Salvadoran writer and artist, who possessed a bohemian spirit and a \"viper's tongue\".\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry, thoroughly enchanted by the diminutive woman, would leave and then return to her many times—she was both his muse and, over the long term, the source of much of his angst.[21] It was a stormy union, with Saint-Exupéry travelling frequently and indulging in numerous affairs, most notably with the Frenchwoman Hélène de Vogüé (1908–2003), known as \"Nelly\" and referred to as \"Madame de B.\" in Saint-Exupéry biographies.[22][Note 2] Vogüé became Saint-Exupéry's literary executrix after his death and also wrote her own Saint-Exupéry biography under a pseudonym, Pierre Chevrier.[24]\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry continued to write until the spring of 1943, when he left the United States with American troops bound for North Africa in the Second World War.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Memorial plaque for Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in Markkleeberg (Germany), 2022. In 1939, he came to see his German publisher Karl Rauch who had printed the first German edition of \"Terre des hommes\".\n## Desert crash[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A monument in Tarfaya, Cape Juby, Morocco, commemorating Aéropostale's mail stopover station and Saint-Exupéry, its manager\nOn 30 December 1935, at 2:45 am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exupéry, along with his mechanic-navigator André Prévot, crashed in the Libyan desert,[26] during an attempt to break the speed record in a Paris-to-Saigon air race and win a prize of 150,000 francs.[27][Note 3] The crash site is thought to have been near the Wadi Natrun valley, close to the Nile Delta.[28]\n\n\nBoth Saint-Exupéry and Prévot miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat. Their maps were primitive and ambiguous, leaving them with no idea of their location. Lost among the sand dunes, their sole supplies consisted of some grapes, two oranges, a madeleine, a pint of coffee in a battered thermos, and a half-pint of white wine in another. They also had with them a small store of medicine: \"a hundred grammes of ninety percent alcohol, the same of pure ether, and a small bottle of Iodine.\"[29]\n\n\nThe pair had only one day worth of fluids.[30] They both saw mirages and experienced auditory hallucinations, which were quickly followed by more vivid hallucinations. By the second and third day, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating. On the fourth day, a Bedouin on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment that saved their lives.[27] The near brush with death would figure prominently in his 1939 memoir, *Wind, Sand and Stars*, winner of several awards. Saint-Exupéry's classic novella *The Little Prince*, which begins with a pilot being stranded in the desert, is, in part, a reference to this experience.[31]\n\n\n\n## Canadian and American sojourn and *The Little Prince*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Little Prince\n\n![](image)The vain and petulant Rose in *The Little Prince* was likely inspired by Saint-Exupéry's Salvadoran wife, Consuelo de Saint Exupéry.\nFollowing the German invasion of France in 1940, Saint-Exupéry flew a Bloch MB.174 with the *Groupe de reconnaissance II/33* reconnaissance squadron of the Armée de l'Air.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter France's armistice with Germany, Saint-Exupéry went into exile in North America, escaping through Portugal. He stayed in Estoril, at the Hotel Palácio, between 28 November and 20 December 1940.[32] He described his impressions of his stay in Lettre à un Otage.[33] On the same day that he checked out, he boarded the *S.S. Siboney* and arrived in New York City on the last day of 1940,[34] with the intention of convincing the U.S. to enter the conflict against Nazi Germany quickly.[35] On 14 January 1941, at a Hotel Astor author luncheon attended by approximately 1,500, he belatedly received his National Book Award for *Wind, Sand and Stars*, won a year earlier while he was occupied witnessing the destruction of the French Army.[36] Consuelo followed him to New York City several months later after a chaotic migration to the southern French town of Oppède, where she lived in an artist's commune, the basis of her autobiography, *Kingdom of the Rocks: Memories of Oppède*.[37][38]\n\n\nBetween January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exupérys lived in New York City's Central Park South in twin penthouse apartments,[39] as well as The Bevin House mansion in Asharoken on Long Island, New York and a townhouse on Beekman Place in Manhattan.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)Two editions of *The Little Prince* (lower left and upper right, artwork not shown) on display at the Saint-Exupéry exhibit at the Air and Space Museum in Paris, France. Also, upper left: *Lettre à un otage* (*Letter to a Hostage*), and bottom right: *Pilote de guerre* (English version: *Flight to Arras*).\nSaint-Exupéry and Charles Lindbergh both became P-38 pilots during World War II, with Lindbergh fighting in the Pacific War,[41] and with Saint-Exupéry fighting and dying over the Mediterranean.[42]\n\n\nIt was after Saint-Exupéry's arrival in the United States that the author adopted the hyphen within his surname, as he was annoyed with Americans addressing him as \"Mr. Exupéry\".[3] It was also during this period that he authored *Pilote de guerre (Flight to Arras)*, which earned widespread acclaim, and *Lettre à un otage* (*Letter to a Hostage*), dedicated to the 40 million French living under Nazi oppression, plus numerous shorter pieces in support of France. The Saint-Exupérys also resided in Quebec City, Canada for several weeks during the late spring of 1942, during which time they met a precocious eight-year-old boy with blond curly hair, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exupérys resided.[43][44][Note 4]\n\n\nAfter he returned from his stay in Québec, which had been fraught with illness and stress, the French wife of one of his publishers helped persuade Saint-Exupéry to produce a children's book,[45] hoping to calm his nerves and also compete with the new series of *Mary Poppins* stories by P.L. Travers. Saint-Exupéry wrote and illustrated *The Little Prince* in New York City and the village of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.[43] It would be first published months later in early 1943 in both English and French in the United States, and would only later appear in his native homeland posthumously after the liberation of France, as his works had been banned by the collaborationist Vichy Regime.[46][47][Note 5]\n\n\n\n## Return to war[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1943, following his 27 months in North America, Saint-Exupéry departed with an American military convoy for Algiers, to fly with the Free French Air Force and fight with the Allies in a Mediterranean-based squadron. Then 43, soon to be promoted to the rank of commandant (major), he was far older than most men in operational units. Although eight years over the age limit for such pilots, he had petitioned endlessly for an exemption which had finally been approved by General Dwight Eisenhower. However, Saint-Exupéry had been suffering pain and immobility due to his many previous crash injuries, to the extent that he could not dress himself in his own flight suit or even turn his head leftwards to check for enemy aircraft.[49]\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry was assigned with a number of other pilots to his former unit, renamed *Groupe de reconnaissance 2/33 \"Savoie\"*, flying P-38 Lightnings, which an officer described as \"war-weary, non-airworthy craft\".[50] The Lightnings were also more sophisticated than models he previously flew, requiring him to undertake seven weeks of stringent training before his first mission. After wrecking a P-38 through engine failure on his second mission, he was grounded for eight months, but was then later reinstated to flight duty on the personal intervention of General Ira Eaker, Deputy Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces.[51][42][Note 6]\n\n\nAfter Saint-Exupéry resumed flying, he also returned to his longtime habit of reading and writing while flying his single-seat Lockheed F-5B (a specially configured P-38 reconnaissance variant). His prodigious studies of literature gripped him and on occasion, he continued his readings of literary works until moments before takeoff, with mechanics having warmed up and tested his aircraft for him in preparation for his flight. On one flight, to the chagrin of his colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the airport for an hour after returning, so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exupéry frequently flew with a lined notebook (*carnet*) during his long solitary flights and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him.[53]\n\n\n\n## Disappearance[edit]\n\n\nBefore his return to flight duty with his squadron in North Africa, the collaborationist Vichy Regime unilaterally promoted Saint-Exupéry as one of its members – quite a shock to the author. Subsequently, French General (later French President) Charles de Gaulle, whom Saint-Exupéry held in low regard, publicly implied that the author-pilot was supporting Germany. Depressed at this, he began to drink heavily.[54] His health, physical and mental, had been deteriorating. Saint-Exupéry was said to be intermittently subject to depression and there was discussion about grounding him.[55][Note 7]\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry's last reconnaissance mission was to collect intelligence on German troop movements in and around the Rhone Valley preceding Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France. Although he had been reinstated to his old squadron with the provision that he was to fly only five missions, on 31 July 1944, he took off in an unarmed P-38 on his ninth reconnaissance mission from an airbase on Corsica.[56][Note 8] To the great alarm of his squadron compatriots, he did not return, vanishing without a trace.[58][Note 9] Word of his disappearance soon spread across the literary world and then it spread into international headlines.[59][42]\n\n\n\n### Discovery at sea[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bracelet of Saint-Exupéry found in 1998\n![](image)Part of the landing gear of Saint-Exupéry's plane, recovered from the Mediterranean, displayed at the French Air and Space Museum\nIn September 1998, to the east of Riou Island (south of Marseille) a fisherman found a silver identity bracelet bearing the names of Saint-Exupéry, his wife Consuelo and his American publisher, Reynal & Hitchcock.[60] The bracelet was hooked to a piece of fabric, presumably from his flight suit.[24] Announcement of the discovery was an emotional event in France, where Saint-Exupéry was a national icon, and some disputed its authenticity because it was found far from his intended flight path, implying that the aircraft might not have been shot down.[61]\n\n\nIn May 2000 a diver found debris from a Lockheed P-38 Lightning submerged off the coast of Marseille, near where the bracelet was found. The discovery galvanized the country, which had conducted searches for his aircraft and speculated on Saint-Exupéry's fate for decades.[62] After a two-year delay imposed by the French government, the remnants of the aircraft were recovered in October 2003.[60][Note 10] In 2004, French officials and investigators from the French Underwater Archaeological Department officially confirmed that the wreckage was from Saint-Exupéry's aircraft.[62][64]\n\n\nNo marks or holes attributable to gunfire were found but that was not considered significant as only a small portion of the aircraft was recovered.[63] In June 2004, the fragments were given to the *Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace* (Air and Space Museum) in Le Bourget, Paris, where Saint-Exupéry's life is commemorated in a special exhibit.[65][66]\n\n\n\n### Speculations in 1948, 1972 and 2008[edit]\n\n\nIn 1948, former Luftwaffe telegrapher Rev. Hermann Korth published his war logs, noting an incident that occurred at around noon on 31 July 1944 in which a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 shot down a P-38 Lightning. Korth's account ostensibly supported a shoot-down hypothesis for Saint-Exupéry.[67][68] The veracity of his log was met with skepticism, because it could have described a P-38 which was flown by Second Lieutenant Gene Meredith on 30 July, shot down south of Nice.[67][69][Note 11]\n\n\nIn 1972, the German magazine *Der Landser* quoted a letter from Luftwaffe reconnaissance pilot Robert Heichele, in which he purportedly claimed to have shot down a P-38 on 31 July 1944.[71] His account, corroborated by a spotter, seemingly supported a shoot-down hypothesis of Saint-Exupéry.[72] Heichele's account was met with skepticism, because he described flying a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 D-9, a variant which had not yet entered Luftwaffe service.[73]\n\n\nIn the lists which are held by the *Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv*, no victory was credited to Heichele or his unit in either July or August 1944, and the decrypted report of the day's reconnaissance does not include any flights by 2./NAG 13's Fw 190s.[74] Heichele was shot down on 16 August 1944 and died five days later.[Note 12][75]\n\n\nIn 2008, a French journalist from *La Provence*, who was investigating Saint-Exupéry's death, contacted former Luftwaffe pilots who flew in the area of Marseille, eventually getting an account from Horst Rippert (1922–2013).[65][76][77] (Rippert was the older brother of the famous bass singer Ivan Rebroff, who was born in Berlin as Hans-Rolf Rippert.) In his memoirs, Horst Rippert, an admirer of Saint-Exupéry's books, expressed both fears and doubts that he was responsible but in 2003 he stated that he became certain that he was responsible when he learned the location of Saint-Exupéry's wreckage.[78] Rippert claimed to have reported the kill over his radio but there are no surviving records to verify this account.[68][69][Note 13][Note 14]\n\n\nRippert's account, as it is discussed in two French and German books, was met with both publicity and skepticism.[80][81] Luftwaffe comrades expressed doubts in Rippert's claim, given that he held it private for 64 years.[82][83][Note 15] Very little German documentation survived the war, and contemporary archival sources, consisting mostly of Allied intercepts of Luftwaffe signals, offer no evidence to verify Rippert's claim.[84][85] The entry and exit points of Saint-Exupéry's mission were likely near Cannes, yet his wreckage was discovered south of Marseille.[79]\n\n\nThough it is possible that German fighters could have intercepted, or at least altered, Saint-Exupéry's flight path, the cause of his death remains unknown, and Rippert's account remains one hypothesis among many.[69][79][86][Note 16]\n\n\n\n## Literary works[edit]\n\n\nWhile not precisely autobiographical, much of Saint-Exupéry's work is inspired by his experiences as a pilot. One notable example is his novella, *The Little Prince,* a poetic tale self-illustrated in watercolours in which a pilot stranded in the desert meets a young prince fallen to Earth from a tiny asteroid. \"His most popular work, *The Little Prince* was partially based upon a crash he and his navigator survived in the Libyan desert. They were stranded and dehydrated for four days, nearing death when they miraculously stumbled upon a Bedouin who gave them water.[88] Saint Exupery would later write in *Wind, Sand and Stars* that the Bedouin saved their lives and gave them \"charity and magnanimity [by] bearing the gift of water.\"[89] *The Little Prince* is a philosophical story, including societal criticism, remarking on the strangeness of the adult world. One biographer wrote of his most famous work: \"Rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and his Little Prince,\" and remarking of their dual fates, \"...the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky.\"[24]\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry's notable literary works (published English translations in parentheses) include:[90]\n\n\n\n* *L'Aviateur* (1926) (*The Aviator*, in the anthology *A Sense of Life*)\n* *Courrier sud* (1929) (*Southern Mail*) – made as a movie in French\n* *Vol de nuit* (1931) (*Night Flight*) – winner of the full prix Femina and made twice as a movie and a TV film, both in English\n* *The Wild Garden* (1938) – Limited to one thousand copies privately printed for the friends of the author and his publishers as a New Year's Greeting. The story is taken from the forthcoming book, *Wind, Sand and Stars*, to be published in the spring of 1939.\n* *Terre des hommes* (1939) – winner of the Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française\n\n\n*Wind, Sand and Stars* (simultaneous distinct English version)[Note 17] – winner of the U.S. National Book Award[92][91]\n* *Pilote de guerre* (1942) (titled in English as: *Flight to Arras*) – winner of the Grand Prix Littéraire de l'Aéro-Club de France[93]\n* *Le petit prince* (1943) (*The Little Prince*), posthumous in France[93] – translated into more than 250 languages and dialects and among the top four selling books in the world;[94] made as both movies and TV films in a number of languages, and adapted to numerous other media in many languages\n* *Lettre à un otage* (1944) (*Letter to a Hostage*, posthumous in English)[95]\n\n\n### Published posthumously[edit]\n\n\n* *Citadelle* (1948) (titled in English: as *The Wisdom of the Sands*) – winner of the Prix des Ambassadeurs\n* *Lettres à une jeune fille* (1950)\n* *Lettres de jeunesse, 1923–1931* (1953)\n* *Lettres à l'amie inventée* (1953)[96]\n* *Carnets* (1953)\n* *Lettres à sa mère* (1955)\n* *Un sens à la vie* (1956), (*A Sense of Life*)[97][98][Note 18]\n* *Lettres de Saint-Exupéry* (1960)\n* *Lettres aux américains* (1960)\n* *Écrits de guerre, 1939–1944* (1982) (*Wartime Writings, 1939–1944*)\n* *Manon, danseuse* (2007)\n* *Lettres à l'inconnue* (1992)\n\n\n### Other works[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 1930s, Saint-Exupéry led a mixed life as an aviator, journalist, author and publicist for Air France, Aéropostale's successor. His journalistic writings for *Paris-Soir*, *Marianne* and other newspapers covered events in Indochina and the Far East (1934), the Mediterranean, Soviet Union and Moscow (1935), and the Spanish Civil War (1936–1937). Saint-Exupéry wrote a number of shorter pieces, essays and commentaries for various newspapers and magazines.[99]\n\n\nNotable among those during World War II was \"An Open Letter to Frenchmen Everywhere\", which was highly controversial in its attempt to rally support for France against Nazi oppression at a time when the French were sharply divided between support of the Gaullists and Vichy factions. It was published in *The New York Times Magazine* in November 1942, in its original French in *Le Canada, de Montréal* at the same time, and in *Pour la Victoire* the following month.[100][91] Other shorter pieces include (in French except where translated by others to English):[96][100]\n\n\n\n* \"Une Lettre de M. de Saint-Exupéry\", *Les Annales politiques et littéraires*, 15 December 1931; (extracts from a letter written to Benjamin Crémieux).\n* Preface of *Destin de Le Brix* by José le Boucher, Nouvelle Librairie Française, 1932.\n* Preface of *Grandeur et servitude de l'aviation* by Maurice Bourdet, Paris: Editions Corrêa, 1933.\n* \"Reflections on War\", translated from *Paris-Soir* and published in *Living Age*, November 1938, pp. 225–228.\n* Preface of *Vent se lève* (French translation of *Listen! The Wind*) by Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Paris: Editions Corrêa, 1939.[Note 19]\n* Preface of *Pilotes d'essai* by Jean-Marie Conty, Paris: Edition Spes, 1939.\n* \"Books I Remember\", *Harper's Bazaar*, April 1941.\n* \"Letter to Young Americans\", *The American High School Weekly*, 25 May 1942, pp. 17–18.\n* \"Voulez-vous, Français, vous reconcilier?\", *Le Canada, de Montreal*, 30 November 1942.\n* \"L'Homme et les éléments\", *Confluences*, 1947, Vol. VII, pp. 12–14 (issue dedicated to Saint-Exupéry; originally published in English in 1939 as 'The Elements' in *Wind, Sand and Stars*).\n* \"Lettre Inédite au General C\", *Le Figaro Littéraire*, 10 April 1948 (posthumous).\n* \"Seigneur Berbère\", *La Table Ronde*, No. 7, July 1948 (posthumous).\n\n\n### Censorship and publication bans[edit]\n\n\n*Pilote de guerre* (*Flight To Arras*), which describes the German invasion of France, was slightly censored when it was released in its original French during wartime by Éditions Gallimard in his homeland in 1942, due to the removal of a derogatory remark which was made about Hitler (which Gallimard failed to reinsert in subsequent editions after World War II). Shortly after the book's wartime release in France, Nazi appeasers and Vichy supporters objected to its praise of one of Saint-Exupéry's squadron colleagues, Captain Jean Israël, who was portrayed as being amongst the squadron's bravest defenders during the Battle of France.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn support of their German occupiers and masters, Vichy authorities attacked the author as a defender of Jews (in racist terms) leading to the praised book being banned in France,[*dubious – discuss*] along with prohibitions against further printings of Saint-Exupéry's other works.[47] Prior to France's liberation new printings of Saint-Exupéry's works were made available there only by means of covert print runs, such as that of February 1943 when 1,000 copies of an underground version of *Pilote de guerre* were printed in Lyon. [47][46][101]\n\n\nA further complication occurred due to Saint-Exupéry's and others' view of General Charles de Gaulle, who was held in low regard. Early in the war, de Gaulle became the leader of the Free French Forces in exile, with his headquarters in London. Even though both men were working to free France from Nazi occupation, Saint-Exupéry viewed de Gaulle with apprehension as a possible post-war dictator, and he consequently provided no public support to the General. De Gaulle retaliated by implying that the author was a supporter of Germany, and he then had his literary works banned in France's North African colonies. Saint-Exupéry's writings were, with irony, banned simultaneously in occupied France and the territory which was controlled by Free France.[24][102]\n\n\n\n### Extension of copyrights in France[edit]\n\n\nDue to Saint-Exupéry's wartime death, the French government awarded his estate the civil code designation *Mort pour la France* (English: *Died for France*) in 1948. Amongst the law's provisions is an increase of 30 years to the duration of the original copyright's duration of 70 years; thus most of Saint-Exupéry's creative works will not fall out of copyright status in France for an extra 30 years.[103][104]\n\n\n\n## Honours and legacy[edit]\n\n\n* Images of remembrance\n* ![Commemorative inscription in the Panthéon of Paris.](image)\n\nCommemorative inscription in the Panthéon of Paris.\n* ![Portrait and images from The Little Prince on a 50-franc banknote](image)\n\nPortrait and images from *The Little Prince* on a 50-franc banknote\n* ![Historical marker where the Saint-Exupérys resided in Quebec.](image)\n\nHistorical marker where the Saint-Exupérys resided in Quebec.\n\n\n* Saint-Exupéry is commemorated with an inscription in the Panthéon in Paris, France's repository of historical greats. Although his body was never identified, his name was added to the Panthéon in November 1967 by a French legislative act. The inscription reads: \"*A LA MÉMOIRE DE • ANTOINE DE SAINT EXUPERY • POÈTE ROMANCIER AVIATEUR • DISPARU AU COURS D'UNE MISSION • DE RECONNAISSANCE AÉRIENNE • LE 31 JUILLET 1944*\" (To the memory of Antoine de Saint Exupery, poet, novelist, aviator, missing during an aerial reconnaissance mission, 31 July 1944). Amongst other honours from France, he was named a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in April 1930 and was promoted to an Officier de la Légion d'honneur in January 1939. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1940 and was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre avec Palme in 1944.[*citation needed*]\n* From 1993 until the introduction of the euro, Saint-Exupéry's portrait and several of his drawings from *The Little Prince* appeared on France's 50-franc banknote.[24] The French Government also later minted a 100-franc commemorative coin, with Saint-Exupéry on its obverse side, and the Little Prince on its reverse. Brass-plated souvenir *Monnaie de Paris* commemorative medallions were also created in his honour, depicting the pilot's portrait over the P-38 Lightning aircraft he last flew.\n* In 1999, the Government of Quebec and Quebec City added a historical marker to the family home of Charles De Koninck, head of the Department of Philosophy at Université Laval, where the Saint-Exupérys stayed while lecturing in Canada for several weeks during May and June 1942.[*citation needed*]\n* In 2000, on the centenary of his birth, in the city where he was born, he was memorialised when the Lyon Satolas Airport was renamed the Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport. Lyon's TGV bullet train station was also renamed as Gare de Lyon Saint-Exupéry. The author is additionally commemorated by a statue in Lyon, depicting a seated Saint-Exupéry with the little prince standing behind him.[*citation needed*]\n* A street in Montesson, a suburb of Paris, is named for him as Rue Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Museums and exhibits[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A portion of the **Saint-Exupéry exhibit**, in the French Air & Space Museum, Le Bourget, Paris.\n![](image)The facade of the **Antoine de Saint-Exupery Museum** in Tarfaya, Morocco.\n![](image)Lamplighter Square at **The Museum of The Little Prince**, Hakone, Japan.\nMuseum exhibits, exhibitions and theme villages dedicated to both him and his diminutive Little Prince have been created in Le Bourget, Paris and other locations in France, as well as in the Republic of South Korea, Japan, Morocco, Brazil, the United States and Canada:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* The Air and Space Museum at Paris's Le Bourget Airport, in cooperation with The Estate of Saint-Exupéry-d'Agay, has created a permanent exhibit of 300 m2 dedicated to the author, pilot, person and humanist. The *Espace Saint Exupéry* exhibit, officially inaugurated in 2006 on the anniversary of the aviator's birthday,[105] traces each stage of his life as an airmail pioneer, eclectic intellectual artist, and military pilot. It includes artifacts from his life: photographs, his drawings, letters, some of his original notebooks (*carnets*) he scribbled in voluminously and which were later published posthumously, plus remnants of the unarmed P-38 he flew on his last reconnaissance mission and which were recovered from the Mediterranean Sea.[106]\n* In Tarfaya, Morocco, next to the Cape Juby airfield where Saint-Exupéry was based as an Aéropostale airmail pilot/station manager, Antoine de Saint-Exupery Museum was created honouring both him and the company. A small monument at the airfield is also dedicated to them.[*citation needed*]\n* In Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, and Hakone, Japan, theme village museums have been created honouring Saint-Exupéry's *Little Prince*.\n* In January 1995, the Alberta Aviation Museum of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in conjunction with the cultural organization Alliance française, presented a showing of Saint-Exupéry letters, watercolours, sketches and photographs.[107]\n* In São Paulo, Brazil, through 2009, the Oca Art Exhibition Centre presented Saint-Exupéry and The Little Prince as part of The Year of France and The Little Prince. The displays covered over 10,000 m2 on four floors, and chronicled Saint-Exupéry, *The Little Prince* and their philosophies, as visitors passed through theme areas of the desert, asteroids, stars, and the cosmos. The ground floor of the giant exhibition was laid out as a huge map of the routes flown by the author with Aeropostale in South America and around the world. Also included was a full-scale replica of the author's crashed Caudron Simoun, lying wrecked on the ground of a simulated Libyan desert following his disastrous Paris-Saigon race attempt. The miraculous survival of Saint-Exupéry and his mechanic/navigator was subsequently chronicled in the award-winning memoir *Wind, Sand and Stars* (*Terre des hommes*), and also formed the introduction of his most famous work *The Little Prince* (*Le Petit Prince*).[108]\n* In 2011, the City of Toulouse, France, home of Airbus and the pioneering airmail carrier Aéropostale, in conjunction with the Estate of Saint-Exupéry-d'Agay and the Youth Foundation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, hosted a major exposition on Saint-Exupéry and his experience with Aéropostale. The exposition, titled *L'année Antoine de Saint-Exupéry à Toulouse*, exhibited selected personal artifacts of the author-aviator, including gloves, photos, posters, maps, manuscripts, drawings, models of the aircraft he flew, some of the wreckage from his Sahara Desert plane crash, and the personal silver identification bracelet engraved with his and Consuelo's name, presented by his U.S. publisher, which was recovered from his last, ultimate crash site in the Mediterranean Sea.[109]\n* On 27 February 2012, Russia's Ulyanovsk State University inaugurated its new International Saint-Exupéry Centre, led by its Director, Elena Mironova, an associate professor of French. The center will serve as a permanent museum dedicated to the author-aviator, as well as a cultural and linguistics center for the university. The museum was established with the assistance of Civil Aviation College teacher Nikolai Yatsenko, an author of 12 publications on Saint-Exupéry who personally donated some 6,000 related items. Located in Ulyanovsk, the university's new center will also help support the study of international languages in a city which promotes itself as a major aerospace and cultural centre. The centre's opening was attended by Ulyanovsk Governor Sergey Morozov, Sergey Krasnov of the Ulyanovsk Civil Aviation College and other aerospace and academic dignitaries, as well as Veronique Jober, Sorbonne professor of Slavic languages, who addressed the audience by video link from Paris.[110]\n* A number of other prominent exhibitions were created in France and the United States, many of them in 2000, honouring the centenary of the author-aviator's birth.\n* In January 2014, New York City's Morgan Library & Museum featured a major three-month-long exhibition, *The Little Prince: A New York Story*. Celebrating the 70th anniversary year of the novella's publication, its exhibits included many of Saint-Exupéry's original manuscript pages, his story's preliminary drawings and watercolor paintings, and also examined Saint-Exupéry's creative writing processes.[111][112][113][114][115]\n\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n* Saint-Exupéry's 1939 memoir *Terre des hommes* (titled as *Wind, Sand and Stars* in English) was chosen to create the central theme (*Terre des Hommes–Man and His World*) of the 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal, Quebec, Canada (Expo '67), the most successful world's fair of the 20th century. The central theme, which also generated the 17 subsidiary elements used for the world's fair, was elucidated at a 1963 Montebello, Quebec, conference held with some of Canada's leading thinkers. At Montebello, French-Canadian author Gabrielle Roy helped choose the central theme by quoting Saint-Exupéry on mankind's place in the universe:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n> \"*Être homme, c'est précisément être responsable. C'est sentir, en posant sa pierre, que l'on contribue à bâtir le monde*\" (to be a man is to be responsible, to feel that by laying one's own stone, one contributes to building the world)\n> \n> \n\n\nAdditionally, Michèle Lalonde and André Prévost's oratorio *Terre des hommes*, performed at the *Place des Nations* opening ceremonies and attended by the international delegates of the participating countries, strongly projected the French writer's 'idealist rhetoric'. Consuelo de Saint Exupéry (1901–1979), his widow, was also a guest of honour at the opening ceremonies of the world's fair.[116]\n* Asteroid 2578 Saint-Exupéry, discovered in November 1975 by Russian astronomer Tamara Smirnova and provisionally cataloged as Asteroid 1975 VW3, was renamed in the author-aviator's honour.[117] Another asteroid was named as 46610 Bésixdouze (translated to and from both hexadecimal and French as 'B612').[118] Additionally the terrestrial-asteroid protection organization B612 Foundation was named in tribute to the author's *Little Prince*, who fell to Earth from Asteroid B-612.[119][120][121][122]\n* Philatelic tributes have been printed in at least 25 other countries as of 2011[update].[123] Only three years after his death, the pilot-aviator was first featured on an 8 franc French West Africa airmail stamp (Scott Catalog # C11). France followed several months later in 1948 with an 80 franc airmail stamp honouring him (CB1), and later with another stamp honouring both him and airmail pioneer Jean Mermoz, plus the supersonic Concorde passenger airliner, in 1970 (C43).[123] In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the writer's death, Israel issued a stamp honoring \"Saint-Ex\" and *The Little Prince* in 1994.[124]\n* In Argentina and Brazil, where Saint-Exupéry became the founding director of the pioneering South American airmail airline Aeroposta Argentina:\n\t+ the Aguja Saint Exupery is a mountain peak located near the Cerro Chaltén (also known as Monte Fitz Roy) in the Los Glaciares National Park in Patagonia, Argentina, The mountain peak is named in Saint-Exupéry's honour;[*citation needed*]\n\t+ the San Antonio Oeste municipal airport was named Aerodromo Saint Exupery.[125] A small museum exhibit resides in the airport building;\n\t+ the small Brazilian airport serving Ocauçu, São Paulo is named after the pilot, and[*citation needed*]\n\t+ several Argentinian schools are also named after the author-aviator.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe main street of the town of Campeche on the Ilha da Santa Catarina (where florianopolis the capital the state is also situated), is named avenida principe pequeno because of his connection to the region.\n\n\n\n### Institutions and schools[edit]\n\n\n* In 1960 the humanitarian organization *Terre des hommes*, named after Saint-Exupéry's 1939 philosophical memoir *Terre des hommes* (titled as *Wind, Sand and Stars* in English),[126] was founded in Lausanne, Switzerland by Edmond Kaiser. Other *Terre des Hommes* societies were later organized in more countries with similar social aid and humanitarian goals. The several independent groups joined to form a new umbrella organization, *Terre des Hommes-Fédération Internationale* (TDHFI, in English: International Federation of Terre des Hommes, or IFTDH). The national constituents first met in 1966 to formalize their new parent organization, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. As of 2009[update] eleven organizations in Canada, Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and Syria belonged to the Federation. An important part of their works is their consulting role to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).[127]\n* In June 2009, the Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Youth Foundation (FASEJ) was founded in Paris by the Saint-Exupéry–d'Agay Estate, to promote education, art, culture, health and sports for youth worldwide, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This organization, which follows Saint-Exupéry's philosophies and his memory, was financed in part by the sale of one of his original 1936 handwritten manuscripts at a Sotheby's auction for €312,750.[128][129]\n* Numerous public schools, lycées, high schools, colleges and technical schools have been named in honour of Saint-Exupéry across France, Europe, Québec and South America, as well as at least two in Africa. The *École Antoine de Saint-Exupéry de Kigali*, a French international school in Rwanda, is named after him, as is École Francaise Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in Saint Louis, Senegal[130][131]\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nNumerous other tributes have been awarded to honour Saint-Exupéry and his most famous literary creation, his *Little Prince*:\n\n\n\n* The *GR I/33* (later renamed as the 1/33 Belfort Squadron), one of the French Air Force squadrons Saint-Exupéry flew with, adopted the image of the *Little Prince* as part of the squadron and tail insignia on its Dassault Mirage fighter jets.[132]\n* Google celebrated Saint-Exupéry's 110th birthday with a special logotype depicting the little prince being hoisted through the heavens by a flock of birds.[133]\n* Numerous streets and place names are named after the author-aviator throughout France and other countries.[*citation needed*]\n* Cafe Saint-Ex, a popular bar and nightclub in Washington, D.C. near the U-Street corridor, holds Saint-Exupéry as its name source.[*citation needed*]\n* Uruguayan airline BQB Líneas Aéreas named one of its aircraft, an ATR-72 (CX-JPL), in honor of the aviator.[*citation needed*]\n* International Watch Company (IWC) has created many St Exupery tribute versions of several of their wristwatch lines, with the distinctive 'A' from his signature featured on the dial.[*citation needed*]\n* The American aviation magazine *Flying* ranked Saint-Exupéry number 41 on their list of the \"51 Heroes of Aviation\".[134]\n* The French 50 Franc banknote depicted Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and had several features that allude to his works.[135]\n* The new flagship of CMA CGM Group for celebrating her 40th Anniversary, takes the name of **Antoine de Saint-Exupéry** to commemorate his achievement.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n* *Wings of Courage* is a 1995 docudrama by French director Jean-Jacques Annaud. The movie was the world's first dramatic picture shot in the IMAX-format and is an account of the true story of early airmail pilots Henri Guillaumet (played by Craig Sheffer), Saint-Exupéry played by Tom Hulce, and several others.[*citation needed*]\n* Saint-Exupéry and his wife Consuelo were portrayed by Bruno Ganz and Miranda Richardson in the 1997 biopic *Saint-Ex*, a British film biography of the French author-pilot. It also featured Eleanor Bron and was filmed and distributed in the United Kingdom, with scripting by Frank Cottrell Boyce. The film combines elements of biography, documentary, and dramatic licence.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\n* After his disappearance, Consuelo de Saint Exupéry wrote *The Tale of the Rose*, which was published in 2000 and subsequently translated into 16 languages.[136]\n* Saint-Exupéry is mentioned in Tom Wolfe's *The Right Stuff*: \"A saint in short, true to his name, flying up here at the right hand of God.

His father and mother were Viscount Jean de Saint Exupéry (1863–1904; different sources name his father as Jean-Marc or Caesar de Saint Exupéry[11]) and Visountess Marie, née Boyer de Fonscolombe (1875–1972). He was baptized in a Catholic ceremony in his great-aunt's chapel on 15 August 1900 in Saint-Maurice-de-Rémens; his godfather was his uncle, Roger de Saint Exupéry, Earl of Miremont (1865 – August 1914, killed leading his battalion in Maissin, Belgium, during the First World War), and his godmother was his aunt Madeleine Fonscolombe.[10]\n2. **^** \n\nHélène (Nelly) de Vogüé (1908–2003), born Hélène Jaunez to a French businessman, became a well known French business executive and also an intellectual fluent in several languages. She married the equally well known French noble, Jean de Vogüé, in 1927 and had one child with him, a son named Patrice. Hélène is referred to only as \"Madame de B.\" in multiple Saint-Exupéry biographies. This occurred due to agreements she made with writers before granting them access to her troves of the author-aviator's writings, which she deposited in the French national archives – from which they will not be released until 2053. It is believed she sought her anonymity to protect Saint-Exupéry's reputation, as during the Second World War, the U.S. OSS suspected she was a secret Vichy agent and Nazi collaborator.[23]\n3. **^** \n\nThe aircraft Saint-Exupéry was flying when he crashed in the Sahara was a Caudron C.630 Simoun, Serial Number 7042, with the French registration F-ANRY, with 'F' being the international designator for France, and the remainder being derived from 'ANtoine de saint-exupéRY'.\n4. **^** \n\nThe large home of Charles De Koninck has since been classified as a historical building and has been visited frequently by numerous worldwide personalities from academic, scientific, intellectual, and political circles. Thomas kept a few memories from Saint-Exupéry's visit: \"[He was] a great man. He was the aviator. Someone we would get attached to quite easily, who would show interest in us, the kids. He would make us paper planes, drawings. [...] He loved mathematical enigmas.\" The following year, he published *The Little Prince*. According to the local legend, Saint-Exupéry received his inspiration from the junior De Koninck, who asked many questions. However, Thomas De Koninck denied this interpretation: \"*The Little Prince* is Saint-Exupéry himself.\"\n5. **^** \n\nAlthough Saint-Exupéry's regular publisher in France, Gallimard, lists *Le Petit Prince* as being published in 1946, that apparently is a legalistic interpretation possibly designed to allow for an extra year of the novella's copyright protection period and is based on Gallimard's explanation that sales of the book started only in 1946. Other sources, such as the one referenced, depict the first Librairie Gallimard printing of 12,250 copies as occurring on 30 November 1945.[48]\n6. **^** \n\nAfter being grounded following his crash, Saint-Exupéry spared no efforts in his campaign to return to active combat flying duty. He utilized all his contacts and powers of persuasion to overcome his age and physical handicap barriers, which would have completely barred an ordinary patriot from serving as a war pilot. Instrumental in his reinstatement was an agreement he proposed to John Phillips, a fluently bilingual *Life Magazine* correspondent in February 1944, where Saint-Exupéry committed to \"...write, and I'll donate what I do to you, for your publication, if you get me reinstated into my squadron.\"[52] Phillips later met with a high level U.S. Army Air Forces press officer in Italy, Colonel John Reagan McCrary, who conveyed the *Life Magazine* request to General Eaker. The approval for return to flying status would be made \"...not through favoritism, but through exception\". The brutalized French, it was noted, would cut a German's throat \"...probably with more relish than anybody\".\n7. **^** Saint-Exupéry suffered recurring pain and immobility from previous injuries due to his five serious aircraft crashes. After his death, they were also vague suggestions that his disappearance was the result of suicide rather than aircraft failure or combat loss.\n8. **^** Various sources state that his final flight was either his seventh, eight, ninth, and even his 10th mission. He volunteered for almost every proposed mission submitted to his squadron, and protested fiercely after being grounded following his second sortie, which ended with a demolished P-38. Saint-Exupéry's friends, colleagues and compatriots were working to keep him grounded and out of harm's way, but his connections in high places, plus a publishing agreement with *Life Magazine*, were instrumental in having the grounding lifted.[57]\n9. **^** One ruse contemplated by GR II/33's commanders was to expose Saint-Exupéry \"accidentally\" to the plans of the pending invasion of France so he could be subsequently grounded. No air force general would countermand such a grounding order and risk Saint-Exupéry's being captured by the Germans if he were forced down. Saint-Exupéry's commanding officer – a close friend of his – was ill and absent when the author took off on his final flight. The commander \"bawled out\" his staff when he learned that a grounding scheme had not been implemented.\n10. **^** \n\nSaint-Exupéry's P-38, as identified in the wreckage recovery report, was an F-5B-1-LO, LAC 2734 variant, serial number 42-68223, which departed Borgo-Porreta, Bastia, Corsica, France on 31 July 1944, at 8:45a.m. The report includes an image of a component bearing a serial number which confirmed it came from Saint-Exupéry's aircraft. The size of the debris field – 1 km (0.62 mi) long and 400 m (1,300 ft) wide – suggested that the aircraft had struck the water at high velocity.[63]\n11. **^** The Luftwaffe pilot was on patrol near Corsica, and could have intercepted Lt. Meredith.[69] Lt. Meredith's remains were not recovered. He is listed on the Tablets of the Missing at the Florence, Italy ABMC Cemetery {ABMC Records}. Lt. Meredith was shot down by *Feldwebel* Guth of 3./*Jagdgruppe* 200, the same unit in which Horst Rippert (see below) was serving. Guth's victory claim is recorded in the lists which are held by the German *Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv* . The progress of the interception was followed by Allied radar and radio monitoring stations and documented in Missing Air Crew Report 7339 on the loss of Second Lieutenant Gene C. Meredith of the 23rd Photographic Squadron/5th Reconnaissance Group. The intercepted Mediterranean Allied Air Forces Signals Intelligence Report for 30 July records that \"an Allied reconnaissance aircraft was claimed shot down at 1115 [GMT]\". The last estimated position of Meredith's plane is 4307N, 0756E.[70]\n12. **^** He is buried in the German military cemetery at Dagneux, France.\n13. **^** The RAF's No. 276 Wing (Signals Intelligence, Allied intercepts of Luftwaffe communications) Operations Record Book for 31 July 1944 notes only: \"... three enemy fighter sections between 0758/0929 hours operating in reaction to Allied fighters over Cannes, Toulon and the area to the North. No contacts. Patrol activity north of Toulon reported between 1410/1425 hours\".[69]\n14. **^** In documents OIS 4FG 40 and OP rep 25 (available at SHD / Air), the 4th Fighter Squadron on a sweeping mission from Vercors to Orange, observed two German \"bogeys\" flying East at 11:30a.m. Given Saint-Exupéry's fuel reserves and expected mission duration, it is possible that he crossed paths with the German aircraft.[79]\n15. **^** The proposed \"suppression\" of Rippert's claim due to Saint-Exupéry's stature was also met with skepticism as Luftwaffe pilots tended to immediately report their kills, and the Allies did not broadcast Saint-Exupéry's status as missing for at least two days.[69] It is feasible that Rippert did not push for an official kill, given that he was flying alone with no spotter to corroborate.[79] After the war, Horst Rippert became a television journalist and led the ZDF sports department. He was the brother of German singer Ivan Rebroff. Rippert died in 2013.\n16. **^** Of further note, as described in the history of the 33rd Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, a P-38 triggered anti-aircraft fire near Istres on 31 July, a reminder that there are many possible direct or indirect causes of Saint-Exupéry's death.[87][79]\n17. **^** The French and English versions of this book (*Terre des hommes*/*Wind, Sand and Stars*) differed significantly, with Saint-Exupéry removing sections from the original French version he did not consider appropriate for its targeted U.S. audience, and adding new material specifically written for that group and translated into English, which he could not speak. Although it did not appear in its earliest editions of the English translation, *An Appreciation* was added to later printings, contributed by Anne Morrow Lindbergh, and earlier published in *The Saturday Review of Literature* on 14 October 1939.[91]\n18. **^** The last paragraph of *Flying*'s book review of *A Sense of Life* incorrectly states that Saint-Exupéry's last mission was a bombing run, when in fact it was a photo-reconnaissance assignment for the pending invasion of Southern France.\n19. **^** In exchange, Lindbergh contributed \"An Appreciation\" to the later printings of Saint-Exupéry's *Wind, Sand and Stars*, earlier published in *The Saturday Review of Literature* on 14 October 1939.[91]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Commire (1980), p. 158.\n2. **^** Commire (1980), p. 161.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Schiff (2006), p. xi.\n4. **^** \"Saint-Exupéry, Antoine de\". *Lexico UK English Dictionary*.

She also wrote the world's longest-running play, the murder mystery *The Mousetrap*, which has been performed in the West End since 1952. A writer during the \"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\", Christie has been called the \"Queen of Crime\". She also wrote six novels under the pseudonym **Mary Westmacott**. In 1971, she was made a Dame (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to literature. *Guinness World Records* lists Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time, her novels having sold more than two billion copies.\n\n\nChristie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon, and was largely home-schooled. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed in 1920 when *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, featuring detective Hercule Poirot, was published. Her first husband was Archibald Christie; they married in 1914 and had one child before divorcing in 1928. Following the breakdown of her marriage and the death of her mother in 1926 she made international headlines by going missing for eleven days. During both World Wars, she served in hospital dispensaries, acquiring a thorough knowledge of the poisons that featured in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. Following her marriage to archaeologist Max Mallowan in 1930, she spent several months each year on digs in the Middle East and used her first-hand knowledge of this profession in her fiction.\n\n\nAccording to UNESCO's Index Translationum, she remains the most-translated individual author.[1] Her novel *And Then There Were None* is one of the top-selling books of all time, with approximately 100 million copies sold. Christie's stage play *The Mousetrap* holds the world record for the longest initial run. It opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End on 25 November 1952, and by 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances. The play was temporarily closed in 2020 because of COVID-19 lockdowns in London before it reopened in 2021.\n\n\nIn 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's Grand Master Award. Later that year, *Witness for the Prosecution* received an Edgar Award for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the Crime Writers' Association. In 2015, *And Then There Were None* was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate.[2] Many of Christie's books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and graphic novels. More than 30 feature films are based on her work.\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and adolescence: 1890–1907[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Christie entitled *Lost in Reverie*, by Douglas John Connah, 1894\nAgatha Mary Clarissa Miller was born on 15 September 1890, into a wealthy upper middle class family in Torquay, Devon. She was the youngest of three children born to Frederick Alvah Miller, \"a gentleman of substance\",[3] and his wife Clarissa Margaret \"Clara\" Miller, née Boehmer.[4]: 1–4[5][6][7]\n\n\nChristie's mother Clara was born in Dublin in 1854[a] to British Army officer Frederick Boehmer[10] and his wife Mary Ann Boehmer (née West). Boehmer died in Jersey in 1863,[b] leaving his widow to raise Clara and her brothers on a meagre income.[11][14]: 10 Two weeks after Boehmer's death, Mary's sister Margaret West married widowed dry goods merchant Nathaniel Frary Miller, a US citizen.[15] To assist Mary financially, they agreed to foster nine-year-old Clara; the family settled in Timperley, Cheshire.[16] Margaret and Nathaniel had no children together, but Nathaniel had a 17-year-old son, Fred Miller, from his previous marriage. Fred was born in New York City and travelled extensively after leaving his Swiss boarding school.[14]: 12 He and Clara were married in London in 1878.[4]: 2–5[5] Their first child, Margaret Frary (\"Madge\"), was born in Torquay in 1879.[4]: 6[17] The second, Louis Montant (\"Monty\"), was born in Morristown, New Jersey, in 1880,[18] while the family was on an extended visit to the United States.[12]: 7\n\n\nWhen Fred's father died in 1869,[19] he left Clara £2,000 (approximately equivalent to £230,000 in 2023); in 1881 they used this to buy the leasehold of a villa in Torquay named Ashfield.[20][21] It was here that their third and last child, Agatha, was born in 1890.[4]: 6–7[7] She described her childhood as \"very happy\".[12]: 3 The Millers lived mainly in Devon but often visited her step-grandmother/great-aunt Margaret Miller in Ealing and maternal grandmother Mary Boehmer in Bayswater.[12]: 26–31 A year was spent abroad with her family, in the French Pyrenees, Paris, Dinard, and Guernsey.[4]: 15, 24–25 Because her siblings were so much older, and there were few children in their neighbourhood, Christie spent much of her time playing alone with her pets and imaginary companions.[12]: 9–10, 86–88 She eventually made friends with other girls in Torquay, noting that \"one of the highlights of my existence\" was her appearance with them in a youth production of Gilbert and Sullivan's *The Yeomen of the Guard*, in which she played the hero, Colonel Fairfax.[4]: 23–27\n\n\n\n![Black-and-white portrait photograph of Christie as a girl](image)Christie as a girl, early 1900s\nAccording to Christie, Clara believed she should not learn to read until she was eight; thanks to her curiosity, she was reading by the age of four.[12]: 13 Her sister had been sent to a boarding school, but their mother insisted that Christie receive her education at home. As a result, her parents and sister supervised her studies in reading, writing and basic arithmetic, a subject she particularly enjoyed. They also taught her music, and she learned to play the piano and the mandolin.[4]: 8, 20–21\n\n\nChristie was a voracious reader from an early age. Among her earliest memories were of reading children's books by Mrs Molesworth and Edith Nesbit. When a little older, she moved on to the surreal verse of Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll.[4]: 18–19 As an adolescent, she enjoyed works by Anthony Hope, Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, and Alexandre Dumas.[12]: 111, 136–37 In April 1901, aged 10, she wrote her first poem, \"The Cow Slip\".[22]\n\n\nBy 1901, her father's health had deteriorated, because of what he believed were heart problems.[14]: 33 Fred died in November 1901 from pneumonia and chronic kidney disease.[23] Christie later said that her father's death when she was 11 marked the end of her childhood.[4]: 32–33\n\n\nThe family's financial situation had, by this time, worsened. Madge married the year after their father's death and moved to Cheadle, Cheshire; Monty was overseas, serving in a British regiment.[14]: 43, 49 Christie now lived alone at Ashfield with her mother. In 1902, she began attending Miss Guyer's Girls' School in Torquay but found it difficult to adjust to the disciplined atmosphere.[12]: 139 In 1905, her mother sent her to Paris, where she was educated in a series of *pensionnats* (boarding schools), focusing on voice training and piano playing. Deciding she lacked the temperament and talent, she gave up her goal of performing professionally as a concert pianist or an opera singer.[14]: 59–61\n\n\n\n### Early literary attempts, marriage, literary success: 1907–1926[edit]\n\n\nAfter completing her education, Christie returned to England to find her mother ailing. They decided to spend the northern winter of 1907–1908 in the warm climate of Egypt, which was then a regular tourist destination for wealthy Britons.[12]: 155–57 They stayed for three months at the Gezirah Palace Hotel in Cairo. Christie attended many dances and other social functions; she particularly enjoyed watching amateur polo matches. While they visited some ancient Egyptian monuments such as the Great Pyramid of Giza, she did not exhibit the great interest in archaeology and Egyptology that developed in her later years.[4]: 40–41 Returning to Britain, she continued her social activities, writing and performing in amateur theatrics. She also helped put on a play called *The Blue Beard of Unhappiness* with female friends.[4]: 45–47\n\n\nAt 18, Christie wrote her first short story, \"The House of Beauty\", while recovering in bed from an illness. It consisted of about 6,000 words about \"madness and dreams\", subjects of fascination for her. Her biographer Janet Morgan has commented that, despite \"infelicities of style\", the story was \"compelling\".[4]: 48–49 (The story became an early version of her story \"The House of Dreams\".)[24] Other stories followed, most of them illustrating her interest in spiritualism and the paranormal. These included \"The Call of Wings\" and \"The Little Lonely God\". Magazines rejected all her early submissions, made under pseudonyms (including Mac Miller, Nathaniel Miller, and Sydney West); some submissions were later revised and published under her real name, often with new titles.[4]: 49–50\n\n\n\n![](image)Christie as a young woman, 1910s\nAround the same time, Christie began work on her first novel, *Snow Upon the Desert*. Writing under the pseudonym Monosyllaba, she set the book in Cairo and drew upon her recent experiences there. She was disappointed when the six publishers she contacted declined the work.[4]: 50–51[25] Clara suggested that her daughter ask for advice from the successful novelist Eden Phillpotts, a family friend and neighbour, who responded to her enquiry, encouraged her writing, and sent her an introduction to his own literary agent, Hughes Massie, who also rejected *Snow Upon the Desert* but suggested a second novel.[4]: 51–52\n\n\nMeanwhile, Christie's social activities expanded, with country house parties, riding, hunting, dances, and roller skating.[12]: 165–66 She had short-lived relationships with four men and an engagement to another.[14]: 64–67 In October 1912, she was introduced to Archibald \"Archie\" Christie at a dance given by Lord and Lady Clifford at Ugbrooke, about 12 miles (19 km) from Torquay. The son of a barrister in the Indian Civil Service, Archie was a Royal Artillery officer who was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps in April 1913.[26] The couple quickly fell in love. Three months after their first meeting, Archie proposed marriage, and Agatha accepted.[4]: 54–63\n\n\n\n![](image)Christie as a nurse in the Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross. She is pictured in 1915 outside her childhood home of Ashfield.\nWith the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Archie was sent to France to fight. They married on Christmas Eve 1914 at Emmanuel Church, Clifton, Bristol, close to the home of his mother and stepfather, when Archie was on home leave.[27][28] Rising through the ranks, he was posted back to Britain in September 1918 as a colonel in the Air Ministry. Christie involved herself in the war effort as a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross. From October 1914 to May 1915, then from June 1916 to September 1918, she worked 3,400 hours in the Town Hall Red Cross Hospital, Torquay, first as a nurse (unpaid) then as a dispenser at £16 (approximately equivalent to £1,130 in 2023) a year from 1917 after qualifying as an apothecary's assistant.[4]: 69[29] Her war service ended in September 1918 when Archie was reassigned to London, and they rented a flat in St. John's Wood.[4]: 73–74\n\n\nChristie had long been a fan of detective novels, having enjoyed Wilkie Collins's *The Woman in White* and *The Moonstone*, and Arthur Conan Doyle's early Sherlock Holmes stories. She wrote her first detective novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, in 1916. It featured Hercule Poirot, a former Belgian police officer with \"magnificent moustaches\" and a head \"exactly the shape of an egg\",[30]: 13 who had taken refuge in Britain after Germany invaded Belgium. Christie's inspiration for the character came from Belgian refugees living in Torquay, and the Belgian soldiers she helped to treat as a volunteer nurse during the First World War.[4]: 75–79[31]: 17–18 Her original manuscript was rejected by Hodder & Stoughton and Methuen. After keeping the submission for several months, John Lane at The Bodley Head offered to accept it, provided that Christie change how the solution was revealed. She did so, and signed a contract committing her next five books to The Bodley Head, which she later felt was exploitative.[4]: 79, 81–82 It was published in 1920.[22]\n\n\n\n![Black-and-white photograph of three men in suits and one woman seated in a room and looking at an open newspaper](image)Archie Christie, Major Belcher (tour leader), Mr. Bates (secretary) and Agatha Christie on the 1922 British Empire Expedition Tour\nChristie settled into married life, giving birth to her only child, Rosalind Margaret Clarissa (later Hicks), in August 1919 at Ashfield.[4]: 79[14]: 340, 349, 422 Archie left the Air Force at the end of the war and began working in the City financial sector on a relatively low salary. They still employed a maid.[4]: 80–81 Her second novel, *The Secret Adversary* (1922), featured a new detective couple Tommy and Tuppence, again published by The Bodley Head. It earned her £50 (approximately equivalent to £3,400 in 2023). A third novel, *Murder on the Links*, again featured Poirot, as did the short stories commissioned by Bruce Ingram, editor of *The Sketch* magazine, from 1923.[4]: 83 She now had no difficulty selling her work.[30]: 33\n\n\nIn 1922, the Christies joined an around-the-world promotional tour for the British Empire Exhibition, led by Major Ernest Belcher. Leaving their daughter with Agatha's mother and sister, in 10 months they travelled to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Canada.[4]: 86–103[32] They learned to surf prone in South Africa; then, in Waikiki, they were among the first Britons to surf standing up, and extended their time there by three months to practise.[33][34] She is remembered at the British Surfing Museum as having said about surfing, \"*Oh it was heaven! Nothing like rushing through the water at what seems to you a speed of about two hundred miles an hour. It is one of the most perfect physical pleasures I have known*.\"[35]\n\n\nWhen they returned to England, Archie resumed work in the city, and Christie continued to work hard at her writing. After living in a series of apartments in London, they bought a house in Sunningdale, Berkshire, which they renamed Styles after the mansion in Christie's first detective novel.[4]: 124–25[14]: 154–55\n\n\nChristie's mother, Clarissa Miller, died in April 1926. They had been exceptionally close, and the loss sent Christie into a deep depression.[14]: 168–72 In August 1926, reports appeared in the press that Christie had gone to a village near Biarritz to recuperate from a \"breakdown\" caused by \"overwork\".[36]\n\n\n\n### Disappearance: 1926[edit]\n\n\n![Newspaper article with portraits of Agatha and Archie Christie](image)*Daily Herald*, 15 December 1926, announcing that Christie had been found. Missing for 11 days, she was found at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in Harrogate, Yorkshire\nIn August 1926, Archie asked Agatha for a divorce. He had fallen in love with Nancy Neele, a friend of Major Belcher.[14]: 173–74 On 3 December 1926, the pair quarrelled after Archie announced his plan to spend the weekend with friends, unaccompanied by his wife. Late that evening, Christie disappeared from their home in Sunningdale. The following morning, her car, a Morris Cowley, was discovered at Newlands Corner in Surrey, parked above a chalk quarry with an expired driving licence and clothes inside.[37][38] It was feared that she might have drowned herself in the Silent Pool, a nearby beauty spot.[39]\n\n\nThe disappearance quickly became a news story. The press sought to satisfy their readers' \"hunger for sensation, disaster, and scandal\".[14]: 224 Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks pressured police, and a newspaper offered a £100 reward (equivalent to £7,500 in 2023). More than 1,000 police officers, 15,000 volunteers, and several aeroplanes searched the rural landscape. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gave a spirit medium one of Christie's gloves to find her.[c] Christie's disappearance made international headlines, including featuring on the front page of *The New York Times*.[41][42] Despite the extensive manhunt, she was not found for another 10 days.[40][43][44] On 14 December 1926, she was located at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in Harrogate, Yorkshire, 184 miles (296 km) north of her home in Sunningdale, registered as \"Mrs Tressa[d] Neele\" (the surname of her husband's lover) from \"Capetown [*sic*] S.A.\" (South Africa).[46] The next day, Christie left for her sister's residence at Abney Hall, Cheadle, where she was sequestered \"in guarded hall, gates locked, telephone cut off, and callers turned away\".[45][47][48][49]\n\n\nChristie's autobiography makes no reference to the disappearance.[12] Two doctors diagnosed her with \"an unquestionable genuine loss of memory\",[49][50] yet opinion remains divided over the reason for her disappearance. Some, including her biographer Morgan, believe she disappeared during a fugue state.[4]: 154–59[40][51] The author Jared Cade concluded that Christie planned the event to embarrass her husband but did not anticipate the resulting public melodrama.[52]: 121 Christie biographer Laura Thompson provides an alternative view that Christie disappeared during a nervous breakdown, conscious of her actions but not in emotional control of herself.[14]: 220–21 Public reaction at the time was largely negative, supposing a publicity stunt or an attempt to frame her husband for murder.[53][e]\n\n\n\n### Second marriage and later life: 1927–1976[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a hotel room with Christie memorabilia on the walls](image)Christie's room at the Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul, where the hotel claims she wrote her 1934 novel *Murder on the Orient Express*\nIn January 1927, Christie, looking \"very pale\", sailed with her daughter and secretary to Las Palmas, Canary Islands, to \"complete her convalescence\",[54] returning three months later.[55][f] Christie petitioned for divorce and was granted a decree nisi against her husband in April 1928, which was made absolute in October 1928. Archie married Nancy Neele a week later.[56] Christie retained custody of their daughter, Rosalind, and kept the Christie surname for her writing.[31]: 21[57]\n\n\nReflecting on the period in her autobiography, Christie wrote, \"So, after illness, came sorrow, despair and heartbreak. There is no need to dwell on it.\"[12]: 340\n\n\nIn 1928, Christie left England and took the (Simplon) Orient Express to Istanbul and then to Baghdad.[4]: 169–70 In Iraq, she became friends with archaeologist Leonard Woolley and his wife, who invited her to return to their dig in February 1930.[12]: 376–77 On that second trip, she met archaeologist Max Mallowan, 13 years her junior.[14]: 284 In a 1977 interview, Mallowan recounted his first meeting with Christie, when he took her and a group of tourists on a tour of his expedition site in Iraq.[58] Christie and Mallowan married in Edinburgh in September 1930.[14]: 295–96[59] Their marriage lasted until Christie's death in 1976.[14]: 413–14 She accompanied Mallowan on his archaeological expeditions, and her travels with him contributed background to several of her novels set in the Middle East.[58] Other novels (such as *Peril at End House*) were set in and around Torquay, where she was raised.[30]: 95 Christie drew on her experience of international train travel when writing her 1934 novel *Murder on the Orient Express*.[4]: 201 The Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul, the eastern terminus of the railway, claims the book was written there and maintains Christie's room as a memorial to the author.[60][g]\n\n\n\n![Colour photograph of the front of a three-storey house](image)Cresswell Place, Chelsea\nChristie and Mallowan first lived in Cresswell Place in Chelsea, and later in Sheffield Terrace, Holland Park, Kensington. Both properties are now marked by blue plaques. In 1934, they bought Winterbrook House in Winterbrook, a hamlet near Wallingford.[61] This was their main residence for the rest of their lives and the place where Christie did much of her writing.[14]: 365 This house also bears a blue plaque. Christie led a quiet life despite being known in Wallingford; from 1951 to 1976 she served as president of the local amateur dramatic society.[62]\n\n\nThe couple acquired the Greenway Estate in Devon as a summer residence in 1938;[14]: 310 it was given to the National Trust in 2000.[63] Christie frequently stayed at Abney Hall, Cheshire, which was owned by her brother-in-law, James Watts, and based at least two stories there: a short story, \"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding\", in the story collection of the same name and the novel *After the Funeral*.[12]: 126[14]: 43 One Christie compendium notes that \"Abney became Agatha's greatest inspiration for country-house life, with all its servants and grandeur being woven into her plots. The descriptions of the fictional Chimneys, Stonygates, and other houses in her stories are mostly Abney Hall in various forms.\"[64]\n\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a wall plaque stating Christie \"lived here 1934–1941\"](image)Blue plaque at 58 Sheffield Terrace, Holland Park, London\n![](image)Winterbrook House, Winterbrook, Oxfordshire. Her final home, Christie lived here with her husband from 1934 until her death in 1976.\nDuring World War II, Christie moved to London and lived in a flat at the Isokon in Hampstead, whilst working in the pharmacy at University College Hospital (UCH), London, where she updated her knowledge of poisons.[65] Her later novel *The Pale Horse* was based on a suggestion from Harold Davis, the chief pharmacist at UCH. In 1977, a thallium poisoning case was solved by British medical personnel who had read Christie's book and recognised the symptoms she described.[66][67]\n\n\nThe British intelligence agency MI5 investigated Christie after a character called Major Bletchley appeared in her 1941 thriller *N or M?*, which was about a hunt for a pair of deadly fifth columnists in wartime England.[68] MI5 was concerned that Christie had a spy in Britain's top-secret codebreaking centre, Bletchley Park. The agency's fears were allayed when Christie told her friend, the codebreaker Dilly Knox, \"I was stuck there on my way by train from Oxford to London and took revenge by giving the name to one of my least lovable characters.\"[68]\n\n\nChristie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1950.[31]: 23 In honour of her many literary works, Christie was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours.[69] She was co-president of the Detection Club from 1958 to her death in 1976.[30]: 93 In 1961, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature degree by the University of Exeter.[31]: 23 In the 1971 New Year Honours, she was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE),[70][71][72] three years after her husband had been knighted for his archaeological work.[73] After her husband's knighthood, Christie could also be styled Lady Mallowan.[30]: 343\n\n\nFrom 1971 to 1974, Christie's health began to fail, but she continued to write. Her last novel was *Postern of Fate* in 1973.[4]: 368–72[14]: 477 Textual analysis suggested that Christie may have begun to develop Alzheimer's disease or other dementia at about this time.[74][75]\n\n\n\n### Personal qualities[edit]\n\n\n![Black-and-white portrait photograph of Christie in later life](image)Christie at Schiphol Airport, 17 September 1964\nIn 1946, Christie said of herself: \"My chief dislikes are crowds, loud noises, gramophones and cinemas. I dislike the taste of alcohol and do not like smoking. I *do* like sun, sea, flowers, travelling, strange foods, sports, concerts, theatres, pianos, and doing embroidery.\"[76]\n\n\nChristie was a lifelong, \"quietly devout\"[4]: 183 member of the Church of England, attended church regularly, and kept her mother's copy of *The Imitation of Christ* by her bedside.[14]: 30, 290 After her divorce, she stopped taking the sacrament of communion.[14]: 263\n\n\nThe Agatha Christie Trust For Children was established in 1969,[77] and shortly after Christie's death a charitable memorial fund was set up to \"help two causes that she favoured: old people and young children\".[78]\n\n\nChristie's obituary in *The Times* notes that \"she never cared much for the cinema, or for wireless and television.\" Further,\n\n\n\n\n> Dame Agatha's private pleasures were gardening – she won local prizes for horticulture – and buying furniture for her various houses. She was a shy person: she disliked public appearances, but she was friendly and sharp-witted to meet. By inclination as well as breeding, she belonged to the English upper middle class. She wrote about, and for, people like herself. That was an essential part of her charm.[3]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Death and estate[edit]\n\n\n### Death and burial[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a sandstone headstone](image)Christie's gravestone at St Mary's Church, Cholsey, Oxfordshire\nChristie died peacefully on 12 January 1976 at age 85 from natural causes at her home at Winterbrook House.[79][80] Upon her death, two West End theatres – the St. Martin's, where *The Mousetrap* was playing, and the Savoy, which was home to a revival of *Murder at the Vicarage* – dimmed their outside lights in her honour.[30]: 373 She was buried in the nearby churchyard of St Mary's, Cholsey, in a plot she had chosen with her husband 10 years previously. The simple funeral service was attended by about 20 newspaper and TV reporters, some having travelled from as far away as South America. Thirty wreaths adorned Christie's grave, including one from the cast of her long-running play *The Mousetrap* and one sent \"on behalf of the multitude of grateful readers\" by the Ulverscroft Large Print Book Publishers.[81]\n\n\nMallowan, who remarried in 1977, died in 1978 and was buried next to Christie.[82]\n\n\n\n###  Estate and subsequent ownership of works[edit]\n\n\nChristie was unhappy about becoming \"an employed wage slave\",[14]: 428 and for tax reasons set up a private company in 1955, Agatha Christie Limited, to hold the rights to her works. In about 1959 she transferred her 278-acre home, Greenway Estate, to her daughter, Rosalind Hicks.[83][84] In 1968, when Christie was almost 80, she sold a 51% stake in Agatha Christie Limited (and the works it owned) to Booker Books (better known as Booker Author's Division), which by 1977 had increased its stake to 64%.[4]: 355[85] Agatha Christie Limited still owns the worldwide rights for more than 80 of Christie's novels and short stories, 19 plays, and nearly 40 TV films.[86]\n\n\nIn the late 1950s, Christie had reputedly been earning around £100,000 (approximately equivalent to £3,000,000 in 2023) per year. Christie sold an estimated 300 million books during her lifetime.[87] At the time of her death in 1976, \"she was the best-selling novelist in history.\"[88]\nOne estimate of her total earnings from more than a half-century of writing is $20 million (approximately $107.1 million in 2023).[89] As a result of her tax planning, her will left only £106,683[h] (approximately equivalent to £970,000 in 2023) net, which went mostly to her husband and daughter along with some smaller bequests.[79][91] Her remaining 36% share of Agatha Christie Limited was inherited by Hicks, who passionately preserved her mother's works, image, and legacy until her own death 28 years later.[83] The family's share of the company allowed them to appoint 50% of the board and the chairman, and retain a veto over new treatments, updated versions, and republications of her works.[83][92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Greenway in Devon, Christie's summer home from 1938. The estate was used as a setting for some of her plots, including *Dead Man's Folly*. The final episode of *Agatha Christie's Poirot* was also filmed here in 2013.[93]\nIn 2004, Hicks' obituary in *The Telegraph* noted that she had been \"determined to remain true to her mother's vision and to protect the integrity of her creations\" and disapproved of \"merchandising\" activities.[83] Upon her death on 28 October 2004, the Greenway Estate passed to her son Mathew Prichard. After his stepfather's death in 2005, Prichard donated Greenway and its contents to the National Trust.[83][94]\n\n\nChristie's family and family trusts, including great-grandson James Prichard, continue to own the 36% stake in Agatha Christie Limited,[86] and remain associated with the company. In 2020, James Prichard was the company's chairman.[95] Mathew Prichard also holds the copyright to some of his grandmother's later literary works including *The Mousetrap*.[14]: 427 Christie's work continues to be developed in a range of adaptations.[96]\n\n\nIn 1998, Booker sold its shares in Agatha Christie Limited (at the time earning £2,100,000, approximately equivalent to £4,700,000 in 2023 annual revenue) for £10,000,000 (approximately equivalent to £22,200,000 in 2023) to Chorion, whose portfolio of authors' works included the literary estates of Enid Blyton and Dennis Wheatley.[92] In February 2012, after a management buyout, Chorion began to sell off its literary assets.[86] This included the sale of Chorion's 64% stake in Agatha Christie Limited to Acorn Media UK.[97] In 2014, RLJ Entertainment Inc. (RLJE) acquired Acorn Media UK, renamed it Acorn Media Enterprises, and incorporated it as the RLJE UK development arm.[98]\n\n\nIn late February 2014, media reports stated that the BBC had acquired exclusive TV rights to Christie's works in the UK (previously associated with ITV) and made plans with Acorn's co-operation to air new productions for the 125th anniversary of Christie's birth in 2015.[99] As part of that deal, the BBC broadcast *Partners in Crime*[100] and *And Then There Were None*,[101] both in 2015.[102] Subsequent productions have included *The Witness for the Prosecution*[103] but plans to televise *Ordeal by Innocence* at Christmas 2017 were delayed because of controversy surrounding one of the cast members.[104] The three-part adaptation aired in April 2018.[105] A three-part adaptation of *The A.B.C. Murders* starring John Malkovich and Rupert Grint began filming in June 2018 and was first broadcast in December 2018.[106][107] A two-part adaptation of *The Pale Horse* was broadcast on BBC1 in February 2020.[108] *Death Comes as the End* will be the next BBC adaptation.[109]\n\n\nSince 2020, reissues of Christie's Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot novels by HarperCollins have removed \"passages containing descriptions, insults or references to ethnicity\".[110]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agatha Christie bibliography\n\n### Works of fiction[edit]\n\n\n#### Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple[edit]\n\n\n![Drawing of a gentleman in a dinner suit twirling his large moustache, illustrating the Christie story \"13 for Dinner\"](image)An early depiction of detective Hercule Poirot, from *The American Magazine*, March 1933\nChristie's first published book, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, was released in 1920 and introduced the detective Hercule Poirot, who appeared in 33 of her novels and more than 50 short stories.\n\n\nOver the years, Christie grew tired of Poirot, much as Doyle did with Sherlock Holmes.[4]: 230 By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt he was \"an egocentric creep\".[111] Thompson believes Christie's occasional antipathy to her creation is overstated, and points out that \"in later life she sought to protect him against misrepresentation as powerfully as if he were her own flesh and blood\".[14]: 282 Unlike Doyle, she resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular.[4]: 222 She married off Poirot's \"Watson\", Captain Arthur Hastings, in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.[12]: 268\n\n\nMiss Jane Marple was introduced in a series of short stories that began publication in December 1927 and were subsequently collected under the title *The Thirteen Problems*.[14]: 278 Marple was a genteel, elderly spinster who solved crimes using analogies to English village life.[30]: 47, 74–76 Christie said, \"Miss Marple was not in any way a picture of my grandmother; she was far more fussy and spinsterish than my grandmother ever was\", but her autobiography establishes a firm connection between the fictional character and Christie's step-grandmother Margaret Miller (\"Auntie-Grannie\")[i] and her \"Ealing cronies\".[12]: 422–23[112] Both Marple and Miller \"always expected the worst of everyone and everything, and were, with almost frightening accuracy, usually proved right\".[12]: 422 Marple appeared in 12 novels and 20 stories.\n\n\nDuring the Second World War, Christie wrote two novels, *Curtain* and *Sleeping Murder*, featuring Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, respectively. Both books were sealed in a bank vault, and she made over the copyrights by deed of gift to her daughter and her husband to provide each with a kind of insurance policy.[14]: 344[30]: 190 Christie had a heart attack and a serious fall in 1974, after which she was unable to write.[4]: 372 Her daughter authorised the publication of *Curtain* in 1975,[4]: 375 and *Sleeping Murder* was published posthumously in 1976.[30]: 376 These publications followed the success of the 1974 film version of *Murder on the Orient Express*.[12]: 497[113]\n\n\nShortly before the publication of *Curtain*, Poirot became the first fictional character to have an obituary in *The New York Times*, which was printed on page one on 6 August 1975.[114][115]\n\n\nChristie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple.[30]: 375 In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot – a professional sleuth – would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\"[112]\n\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family supported the release of a new Poirot story, *The Monogram Murders*, written by British author Sophie Hannah.[116] Hannah later published three more Poirot mysteries, *Closed Casket* in 2016, *The Mystery of Three Quarters* in 2018.,[117][118] and *The Killings at Kingfisher Hill* in 2020.\n\n\n\n#### Formula and plot devices[edit]\n\n\nChristie has been called the \"Duchess of Death\", the \"Mistress of Mystery\", and the \"Queen of Crime\".[31]: 15 Early in her career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new.\"[36] According to Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?' Then, slowly, she reveals how the impossible is not only possible but the only thing that could have happened.\"[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAbney Hall, Cheshire, the inspiration for Christie novel settings such as Chimneys and Stonygates\n![](image)\nChristie used inspiration from her stay at the Old Cataract Hotel on the banks of the River Nile in Aswan, Egypt for her 1937 novel *Death on the Nile*\n\nChristie developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the \"Golden Age\" of detective fiction.[119] Author Dilys Winn called Christie \"the doyenne of Coziness\", a sub-genre which \"featured a small village setting, a hero with faintly aristocratic family connections, a plethora of red herrings and a tendency to commit homicide with sterling silver letter openers and poisons imported from Paraguay\".[120] At the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of their deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party; but there are exceptions where it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as *And Then There Were None* and *Endless Night*).[121][122]\n\n\nChristie did not limit herself to quaint English villages – the action might take place on a small island (*And Then There Were None*), an aeroplane (*Death in the Clouds*), a train (*Murder on the Orient Express*), a steamship (*Death on the Nile*), a smart London flat (*Cards on the Table*), a resort in the West Indies (*A Caribbean Mystery*), or an archaeological dig (*Murder in Mesopotamia*) – but the circle of potential suspects is usually closed and intimate: family members, friends, servants, business associates, fellow travellers.[123]: 37 Stereotyped characters abound (the *femme fatale*, the stolid policeman, the devoted servant, the dull colonel), but these may be subverted to stymie the reader; impersonations and secret alliances are always possible.[123]: 58 There is always a motive – most often, money: \"There are very few killers in Christie who enjoy murder for its own sake.\"[14]: 379, 396\n\n\nProfessor of Pharmacology Michael C. Gerald noted that \"in over half her novels, one or more victims are poisoned, albeit not always to the full satisfaction of the perpetrator.\"[124]: viii Guns, knives, garrottes, tripwires, blunt instruments, and even a hatchet were also used, but \"Christie never resorted to elaborate mechanical or scientific means to explain her ingenuity,\"[125]: 57 according to John Curran, author and literary adviser to the Christie estate.[126] Many of her clues are mundane objects: a calendar, a coffee cup, wax flowers, a beer bottle, a fireplace used during a heat wave.[123]: 38\n\n\nAccording to crime writer P. D. James, Christie was prone to making the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Alert readers could sometimes identify the culprit by identifying the least likely suspect.[127] Christie mocked this insight in her foreword to *Cards on the Table*: \"Spot the person least likely to have committed the crime and in nine times out of ten your task is finished. Since I do not want my faithful readers to fling away this book in disgust, I prefer to warn them beforehand *that this is not that kind of book*.\"[128]: 135–36\n\n\nOn BBC Radio 4's *Desert Island Discs* in 2007, Brian Aldiss said Christie had told him she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to \"frame\" that person.[129] Based upon a study of her working notebooks, Curran describes how Christie would first create a cast of characters, choose a setting, and then produce a list of scenes in which specific clues would be revealed; the order of scenes would be revised as she developed her plot. Of necessity, the murderer had to be known to the author before the sequence could be finalised and she began to type or dictate the first draft of her novel.[123] Much of the work, particularly dialogue, was done in her head before she put it on paper.[12]: 241–45[128]: 33\n\n\nIn 2013, the 600 members of the Crime Writers' Association chose *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* as \"the best whodunit ... ever written\".[130] Author Julian Symons observed, \"In an obvious sense, the book fits within the conventions ... The setting is a village deep within the English countryside, Roger Ackroyd dies in his study; there is a butler who behaves suspiciously ... Every successful detective story in this period involved a deceit practised upon the reader, and here the trick is the highly original one of making the murderer the local doctor, who tells the story and acts as Poirot's Watson.\"[119]: 106–07 Critic Sutherland Scott stated, \"If Agatha Christie had made no other contribution to the literature of detective fiction she would still deserve our grateful thanks\" for writing this novel.[131]\n\n\nIn September 2015, to mark her 125th birthday, *And Then There Were None* was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate.[132] The novel is emblematic of both her use of formula and her willingness to discard it. \"*And Then There Were None* carries the 'closed society' type of murder mystery to extreme lengths,\" according to author Charles Osborne.[30]: 170 It begins with the classic set-up of potential victim(s) and killer(s) isolated from the outside world, but then violates conventions. There is no detective involved in the action, no interviews of suspects, no careful search for clues, and no suspects gathered together in the last chapter to be confronted with the solution. As Christie herself said, \"Ten people had to die without it becoming ridiculous or the murderer being obvious.\"[12]: 457 Critics agreed she had succeeded: \"The arrogant Mrs. Christie this time set herself a fearsome test of her own ingenuity ... the reviews, not surprisingly, were without exception wildly adulatory.\"[30]: 170–71\n\n\n\n#### Character stereotypes and racism[edit]\n\n\nFor information on Christie's book originally titled *Ten Little Niggers*, see And Then There Were None.\n\nChristie included stereotyped descriptions of characters in her work, especially before 1945 (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.[4]: 264–66 For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection *The Mysterious Mr Quin*. In 1947, the Anti-Defamation League in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie's American publishers, Dodd, Mead and Company, regarding perceived antisemitism in her works. Christie's British literary agent later wrote to her US representative, authorising American publishers to \"omit the word 'Jew' when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books.\"[14]: 386\n\n\nIn *The Hollow*, published in 1946, one of the characters is described by another as \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a corncrake ... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some \"foreign\" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (*Hallowe'en Party*) and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in *Three Act Tragedy*), but they are rarely the culprits.[133]\n\n\nIn 2023, the *Telegraph* reported that several Agatha Christie novels have been edited to remove potentially offensive language, including insults and references to ethnicity. Poirot and Miss Marple mysteries written between 1920 and 1976 have had passages reworked or removed in new editions published by HarperCollins, in order to strip them of language and descriptions that modern audiences find offensive, especially those involving the characters Christie’s protagonists encounter outside the UK. Sensitivity readers had made the edits, which were evident in digital versions of the new editions, including the entire Miss Marple run and selected Poirot novels set to be released or that have been released since 2020.[134]\n\n\n\n#### Other detectives[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, Christie also created amateur detectives Thomas (Tommy) Beresford and his wife, Prudence \"Tuppence\" *née* Cowley, who appear in four novels and one collection of short stories published between 1922 and 1974. Unlike her other sleuths, the Beresfords were only in their early twenties when introduced in *The Secret Adversary*, and were allowed to age alongside their creator.[30]: 19–20 She treated their stories with a lighter touch, giving them a \"dash and verve\" which was not universally admired by critics.[31]: 63 Their last adventure, *Postern of Fate*, was Christie's last novel.[14]: 477\n\n\nHarley Quin was \"easily the most unorthodox\" of Christie's fictional detectives.[31]: 70 Inspired by Christie's affection for the figures from the Harlequinade, the semi-supernatural Quin always works with an elderly, conventional man called Satterthwaite. The pair appear in 14 short stories, 12 of which were collected in 1930 as *The Mysterious Mr. Quin*.[30]: 78, 80[135] Mallowan described these tales as \"detection in a fanciful vein, touching on the fairy story, a natural product of Agatha's peculiar imagination\".[30]: 80 Satterthwaite also appears in a novel, *Three Act Tragedy*, and a short story, \"Dead Man's Mirror\", both of which feature Poirot.[30]: 81\n\n\nAnother of her lesser-known characters is Parker Pyne, a retired civil servant who assists unhappy people in an unconventional manner.[30]: 118–19 The 12 short stories which introduced him, *Parker Pyne Investigates* (1934), are best remembered for \"The Case of the Discontented Soldier\", which features Ariadne Oliver, \"an amusing and satirical self-portrait of Agatha Christie\". Over the ensuing decades, Oliver reappeared in seven novels. In most of them she assists Poirot.[30]: 120\n\n\n\n#### Plays[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*The Mousetrap*, the world's longest-running play, showing at the West End's St Martin's Theatre in 2011 with the sign signifying the 59th year of the production\n![](image)\nThe wooden counter in the foyer of St Martin's Theatre showing 22,461 performances of *The Mousetrap* (pictured in November 2006). Attendees often get their photo taken next to it.[136]\n\nIn 1928, Michael Morton adapted *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* for the stage under the name of *Alibi*.[4]: 177 The play enjoyed a respectable run, but Christie disliked the changes made to her work and, in future, preferred to write for the theatre herself. The first of her own stage works was *Black Coffee*, which received good reviews when it opened in the West End in late 1930.[137] She followed this up with adaptations of her detective novels: *And Then There Were None* in 1943, *Appointment with Death* in 1945, and *The Hollow* in 1951.[4]: 242, 251, 288\n\n\nIn the 1950s, \"the theatre ... engaged much of Agatha's attention.\"[138] She next adapted her short radio play into *The Mousetrap*, which premiered in the West End in 1952, produced by Peter Saunders and starring Richard Attenborough as the original Detective Sergeant Trotter.[136] Her expectations for the play were not high; she believed it would run no more than eight months.[12]: 500 *The Mousetrap* has long since made theatrical history as the world's longest-running play, staging its 27,500th performance in September 2018.[136][139][140][141] The play temporarily closed in March 2020, when all UK theatres shut due to the coronavirus pandemic,[142][143] before it re-opened on 17 May 2021.[144]\n\n\nIn 1953, she followed this with *Witness for the Prosecution*, whose Broadway production won the New York Drama Critics' Circle award for best foreign play of 1954 and earned Christie an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America.[4]: 300[125]: 262 *Spider's Web*, an original work written for actress Margaret Lockwood at her request, premiered in the West End in 1954 and was also a hit.[4]: 297, 300 Christie became the first female playwright to have three plays running simultaneously in London: *The Mousetrap*, *Witness for the Prosecution* and *Spider's Web*.[145] She said, \"Plays are much easier to *write* than books, because you can *see* them in your mind's eye, you are not hampered by all that description which clogs you so terribly in a book and stops you from getting on with what's happening.\"[12]: 459 In a letter to her daughter, Christie said being a playwright was \"a lot of fun!\"[14]: 474\n\n\n\n#### As Mary Westmacott[edit]\n\n\nChristie published six mainstream novels under the name Mary Westmacott, a pseudonym which gave her the freedom to explore \"her most private and precious imaginative garden\".[14]: 366–67[30]: 87–88 These books typically received better reviews than her detective and thriller fiction.[14]: 366 Of the first, *Giant's Bread* published in 1930, a reviewer for *The New York Times* wrote, \"... her book is far above the average of current fiction, in fact, comes well under the classification of a 'good book'. And it is only a satisfying novel that can claim that appellation.\"[146] It was publicized from the very beginning that \"Mary Westmacott\" was a pen name of a well-known author, although the identity behind the pen name was kept secret; the dust jacket of *Giant's Bread* mentions that the author had previously written \"under her real name...half a dozen books that have each passed the thirty thousand mark in sales.\" (In fact, though this was technically true, it disguised Christie's identity through understatement. By the publication of *Giant's Bread*, Christie had published 10 novels and two short story collections, all of which had sold considerably more than 30,000 copies.) After Christie's authorship of the first four Westmacott novels was revealed by a journalist in 1949, she wrote two more, the last in 1956.[14]: 366\n\n\nThe other Westmacott titles are: *Unfinished Portrait* (1934), *Absent in the Spring* (1944), *The Rose and the Yew Tree* (1948), *A Daughter's a Daughter* (1952), and *The Burden* (1956).\n\n\n\n### Non-fiction works[edit]\n\n\nChristie published a few non-fiction works. *Come, Tell Me How You Live*, about working on an archaeological dig, was drawn from her life with Mallowan. *The Grand Tour: Around the World with the Queen of Mystery* is a collection of correspondence from her 1922 Grand Tour of the British Empire, including South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. *Agatha Christie: An Autobiography* was published posthumously in 1977 and adjudged the Best Critical/Biographical Work at the 1978 Edgar Awards.[147]\n\n\n\n### Titles[edit]\n\n\nMany of Christie's works from 1940 onward have titles drawn from literature, with the original context of the title typically printed as an epigraph.[148]\n\n\nThe inspirations for some of Christie's titles include:\n\n\n\n* William Shakespeare's works: *Sad Cypress*, *By the Pricking of My Thumbs*, *There is a Tide ...*, *Absent in the Spring*, and *The Mousetrap*, for example. Osborne notes that \"Shakespeare is the writer most quoted in the works of Agatha Christie\";[30]: 164\n* The Bible: *Evil Under the Sun*, *The Burden*, and *The Pale Horse*;\n* Other works of literature: *The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side* (from Tennyson's \"The Lady of Shalott\"), *The Moving Finger* (from Edward FitzGerald's translation of the *Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám*), *The Rose and the Yew Tree* (from T. S. Eliot's *Four Quartets*), *Postern of Fate* (from James Elroy Flecker's \"Gates of Damascus\"), *Endless Night* (from William Blake's \"Auguries of Innocence\"), *N or M?* (from the *Book of Common Prayer*), and *Come, Tell Me How You Live* (from Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking-Glass*).\n\n\nChristie biographer Gillian Gill said, \"Christie's writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie's novels succeed.\"[128]: 208 Reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror, numerous Christie titles were drawn from well-known children's nursery rhymes: *And Then There Were None* (from \"Ten Little Niggers\", a rhyme also published as \"Ten Little Indians\", both of which were also used for the book's title in some printings),[149] *One, Two, Buckle My Shoe* (from \"One, Two, Buckle My Shoe\"), *Five Little Pigs* (from \"This Little Piggy\"), *Crooked House* (from \"There Was a Crooked Man\"), *A Pocket Full of Rye* (from \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\"), *Hickory Dickory Dock* (from \"Hickory Dickory Dock\"), and *Three Blind Mice* (from \"Three Blind Mice\").[128]: 207–08\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a large, book-shaped bronze memorial](image)Memorial to Christie in central London\nChristie is regularly referred to as the \"Queen of Crime\"—which is now trademarked by the Christie estate—or \"Queen of Mystery\", and is considered a master of suspense, plotting, and characterisation.[150][151][152][153] In 1955, she became the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's Grand Master Award.[147] She was named \"Best Writer of the Century\" and the Hercule Poirot series of books was named \"Best Series of the Century\" at the 2000 Bouchercon World Mystery Convention.[154] In 2013, she was voted \"best crime writer\" in a survey of 600 members of the Crime Writers' Association of professional novelists.[130] However, the writer Raymond Chandler criticised the artificiality of her books, as did writer Julian Symons.[155][119]: 100–30 The literary critic Edmund Wilson described her prose as banal and her characterisations as superficial.[156][j]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"With Christie ... we are dealing not so much with a literary figure as with a broad cultural phenomenon, like Barbie or the Beatles.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Joan Acocella writing in *The New Yorker*[159]\n\nIn 2011, Christie was named by the digital crime drama TV channel Alibi as the second most financially successful crime writer of all time in the United Kingdom, after James Bond author Ian Fleming, with total earnings around £100 million.[160] In 2012, Christie was among the people selected by the artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous work, the Beatles' *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* album cover, \"to celebrate the British cultural figures he most admires\".[161][162] On the record-breaking longevity of Christie's *The Mousetrap* which had marked its 60th anniversary in 2012, Stephen Moss in *The Guardian* wrote, \"the play and its author are the stars\".[136]\n\n\nIn 2015, marking the 125th anniversary of her birth date, 25 contemporary mystery writers and one publisher gave their views on Christie's works. Many of the authors had read Christie's novels first, before other mystery writers, in English or in their native language, influencing their own writing, and nearly all still viewed her as the \"Queen of Crime\" and creator of the plot twists used by mystery authors. Nearly all had one or more favourites among Christie's mysteries and found her books still good to read nearly 100 years after her first novel was published. Just one of the 25 authors held with Wilson's views.[163]\n\n\n\n### Book sales[edit]\n\n\nIn her prime, Christie was rarely out of the bestseller list.[164] She was the first crime writer to have 100,000 copies of 10 of her titles published by Penguin on the same day in 1948.[165][166] As of 2018[update], *Guinness World Records* listed Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time.[167] As of 2020[update], her novels had sold more than two billion copies in 44 languages.[167] Half the sales are of English-language editions, and half are translations.[168][169] According to Index Translationum, as of 2020[update], she was the most-translated individual author.[170][171]\n\n\nChristie is one of the most-borrowed authors in UK libraries.[172][173][174][175] She is also the UK's best-selling spoken-book author. In 2002, 117,696 Christie audiobooks were sold, in comparison to 97,755 for J. K. Rowling, 78,770 for Roald Dahl and 75,841 for J. R. R. Tolkien.[176][177] In 2015, the Christie estate claimed *And Then There Were None* was \"the best-selling crime novel of all time\",[178] with approximately 100 million sales, also making it one of the highest-selling books of all time.[132][179] More than two million copies of her books were sold in English in 2020.[180]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Commemorative blue plaque in the West End marking *The Mousetrap* as the world's longest-running play\nIn 2016, the Royal Mail marked the centenary of Christie's first detective story by issuing six first-class postage stamps of her works: *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd*, *Murder on the Orient Express*, *And Then There Were None*, *The Body in the Library*, and *A Murder is Announced*. *The Guardian* reported that, \"Each design incorporates microtext, UV ink and thermochromic ink. These concealed clues can be revealed using either a magnifying glass, UV light or body heat and provide pointers to the mysteries' solutions.\"[181][182]\n\n\nHer characters and her face appeared on the stamps of many countries like Dominica and the Somali Republic.[183] In 2020, Christie was commemorated on a £2 coin by the Royal Mint for the first time to mark the centenary of her first novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*.[184]\n\n\nIn 2023 a life-size bronze statue of Christie sitting on a park bench holding a book was unveiled in Wallingford.[185]\n\n\n\n### Adaptations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adaptations of Agatha Christie\n\nChristie's works have been adapted for cinema and television. The first was the 1928 British film *The Passing of Mr. Quin*. Poirot's first film appearance was in 1931 in *Alibi*, which starred Austin Trevor as Christie's sleuth.[186]: 14–18 Margaret Rutherford played Marple in a series of films released in the 1960s. Christie liked her acting, but considered the first film \"pretty poor\" and thought no better of the rest.[14]: 430–31\nShe felt differently about the 1974 film *Murder on the Orient Express*, directed by Sidney Lumet, which featured major stars and high production values; her attendance at the London premiere was one of her last public outings.[14]: 476, 482[186]: 57 In 2017, a new film version was released, directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also starred, wearing \"the most extravagant mustache moviegoers have ever seen\".[187] Branagh has since directed two more adaptations of Christie, *Death on the Nile* (2022) and its sequel *A Haunting in Venice* (2023), the latter an adaptation of her 1969 novel *Hallowe'en Party*.[188][189]\n\n\nThe television adaptation *Agatha Christie's Poirot* (1989–2013), with David Suchet in the title role, ran for 70 episodes over 13 series. It received nine BAFTA award nominations and won four BAFTA awards in 1990–1992.[190] The television series *Miss Marple* (1984–1992), with Joan Hickson as \"the BBC's peerless Miss Marple\", adapted all 12 Marple novels.[14]: 500 The French television series *Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie* (2009–2012, 2013–2020), adapted 36 of Christie's stories.[191][192]\n\n\nChristie's books have also been adapted for BBC Radio, a video game series, and graphic novels.[193][194][195][196]\n\n\n\n## Interests and influences[edit]\n\n\n### Pharmacology[edit]\n\n\nDuring the First World War, Christie took a break from nursing to train for the Apothecaries Hall Examination.[124]: xi While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up to date at Torquay Hospital.[12]: 235, 470\n\n\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons ... These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories.\"[124]: viii There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists, and scientists, naïve or suspicious, in Christie's cast of characters; featuring in *Murder in Mesopotamia*, *Cards on the Table*, *The Pale Horse*, and *Mrs. McGinty's Dead*, among many others.[124]\n\n\nGillian Gill notes that the murder method in Christie's first detective novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary\".[128]: 34 In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths ... I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"[197] With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under Ronald Knox's \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".[125]: 58 Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, nicotine, thallium, and other substances were used to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades.[124]\n\n\n\n### Archaeology[edit]\n\n\n> \n> The lure of the past came up to grab me. To see a dagger slowly appearing, with its gold glint, through the sand was romantic. The carefulness of lifting pots and objects from the soil filled me with a longing to be an archaeologist myself.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAgatha Christie[12]: 364\n\nIn her youth, Christie showed little interest in antiquities.[14]: 68 After her marriage to Mallowan in 1930, she accompanied him on annual expeditions, spending three to four months at a time in Syria and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, Nineveh, Tell Arpachiyah, Chagar Bazar, Tell Brak, and Nimrud.[14]: 301, 304, 313, 414 The Mallowans also took side trips whilst travelling to and from expedition sites, visiting Italy, Greece, Egypt, Iran, and the Soviet Union, among other places.[4]: 188–91, 199, 212[12]: 429–37 Their experiences travelling and living abroad are reflected in novels such as *Murder on the Orient Express*, *Death on the Nile*, and *Appointment with Death*.[14]: 514 (n. 6)[198]\n\n\nFor the 1931 digging season at Nineveh, Christie bought a writing table to continue her own work; in the early 1950s, she paid to add a small writing room to the team's house at Nimrud.[14]: 301[30]: 244 She also devoted time and effort each season in \"making herself useful by photographing, cleaning, and recording finds; and restoring ceramics, which she especially enjoyed\".[199][31]: 20–21 She also provided funds for the expeditions.[14]: 414\n\n\nMany of the settings for Christie's books were inspired by her archaeological fieldwork in the Middle East; this is reflected in the detail with which she describes them – for instance, the temple of Abu Simbel as depicted in *Death on the Nile* – while the settings for *They Came to Baghdad* were places she and Mallowan had recently stayed.[4]: 212, 283–84 Similarly, she drew upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig throughout *Murder in Mesopotamia*.[123]: 269 Archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts featured in her works include Dr Eric Leidner in *Murder in Mesopotamia* and Signor Richetti in *Death on the Nile*.[200]: 187, 226–27\n\n\nAfter the Second World War, Christie chronicled her time in Syria in *Come, Tell Me How You Live*, which she described as \"small beer – a very little book, full of everyday doings and happenings\".[201]: (Foreword) From 8 November 2001 to March 2002, The British Museum presented a \"colourful and episodic exhibition\" called *Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia* which illustrated how her activities as a writer and as the wife of an archaeologist intertwined.[202]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nSome of Christie's fictional portrayals have explored and offered accounts of her disappearance in 1926. The film *Agatha* (1979), with Vanessa Redgrave, has Christie sneaking away to plan revenge against her husband; Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution.[203] The *Doctor Who* episode \"The Unicorn and the Wasp\" (17 May 2008) stars Fenella Woolgar as Christie, and explains her disappearance as being connected to aliens. The film *Agatha and the Truth of Murder* (2018) sends her undercover to solve the murder of Florence Nightingale's goddaughter, Florence Nightingale Shore. A fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, *Agatha*.[204] *The Christie Affair*, a Christie-like mystery story of love and revenge by author Nina de Gramont, was a 2022 novel loosely based on Christie's disappearance.[205]\n\n\nOther portrayals, such as the Hungarian film *Kojak Budapesten* (1980), create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skills. In the TV play *Murder by the Book* (1986), Christie (Dame Peggy Ashcroft) murders one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's *Dorothy and Agatha* and *The London Blitz Murders* by Max Allan Collins.[206][207] The American television program *Unsolved Mysteries* devoted a segment to her famous disappearance, with Agatha portrayed by actress Tessa Pritchard. A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series *Gran Hotel* (2011) in which she finds inspiration to write her new novel while aiding local detectives. In the alternative history television film *Agatha and the Curse of Ishtar* (2018), Christie becomes involved in a murder case at an archaeological dig in Iraq.[208] In 2019, Honeysuckle Weeks portrayed Christie in an episode, \"No Friends Like Old Friends\", in a Canadian drama, *Frankie Drake Mysteries.*\n\n\nIn 2020, Heather Terrell, under the pseudonym of Marie Benedict, published *The Mystery of Mrs. Christie*, a fictional reconstruction of Christie's December 1926 disappearance. The novel was on the *USA Today* and *The New York Times* Best Seller lists.[209][210] In December 2020, Library Reads named Terrell a Hall of Fame author for the book.[211]\nAndrew Wilson has written four novels featuring Agatha Christie as a detective: *A Talent For Murder* (2017), *A Different Kind of Evil* (2018), *Death In A Desert Land* (2019) and *I Saw Him Die* (2020).[212] Christie was portrayed by Shirley Henderson in the 2022 comedy/mystery film *See How They Run*.[213][214]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Agatha Christie indult (an oecumenical request to which Christie was signatory seeking permission for the occasional use of the Tridentine (Latin) mass in England and Wales)\n* Agatha Awards (literary awards for mystery and crime writers)\n* Agatha Christie Award (Japan) (literary award for unpublished mystery novels)\n* List of solved missing person cases\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Most biographers give Christie's mother's place of birth as Belfast but do not provide sources. Current primary evidence, including census entries (place of birth Dublin), her baptism record (Dublin), and her father's service record and regimental history (when her father was in Dublin), indicates she was almost certainly born in Dublin in the first quarter of 1854.[8][9][10]\n2. **^** Boehmer's death registration states he died at age 49 from bronchitis after retiring from the army,[11] but Christie and her biographers have consistently claimed he was killed in a riding accident while still a serving officer.[12]: 5[13][4]: 2[14]: 9–10\n3. **^** Dorothy L. Sayers, who visited the \"scene of the disappearance\", later incorporated details in her book *Unnatural Death*.[40]\n4. **^** The notice placed by Christie in *The Times* (11 December 1926, p.1) gives the first name as Teresa, but her hotel register signature more naturally reads Tressa; newspapers reported that Christie used Tressa on other occasions during her disappearance (including joining a library).[45]\n5. **^** Christie hinted at a nervous breakdown, saying to a woman with similar symptoms, \"I think you had better be very careful; it is probably the beginning of a nervous breakdown.\"[12]: 337\n6. **^** Christie's authorised biographer includes an account of specialist psychiatric treatment following Christie's disappearance, but the information was obtained second or third hand after her death.[4]: 148–49, 159\n7. **^** Other authors claim Christie wrote *Murder on the Orient Express* whilst at a dig at Arpachiyah.[4]: 206[30]: 111\n8. **^** According to other sources, her estate was valued at £147 810.[90]\n9. **^** Christie's familial relationship to Margaret Miller (née West) was complex. As well as being Christie's maternal great-aunt, Miller was Christie's father's step-mother as well as Christie's mother's foster mother and step-mother-in-law – hence the appellation \"Auntie-Grannie\".\n10. **^** Wilson's 1945 essay, \"Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?\" was dismissive of the detective fiction genre in general but did not mention Christie by name.[157][158]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Most translated author\". *Guinness World Records*. 7 March 2017.\n2. **^** \"Result of world's favourite Christie global vote\". *Agatha Christie*. 22 December 2015.

He is best known as the author of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. His given name was **Cáo Zhān**  (曹霑) and his courtesy name was **Mèngruǎn** (simplified Chinese: 梦阮; traditional Chinese: 夢阮).\n\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nCao Xueqin was born to a Han Chinese clan[5] that was brought into personal service (as *booi aha* or bondservants of Cigu Niru) to the Manchu royalty in the late 1610s.[6] His ancestors distinguished themselves through military service in the Plain White Banner (正白旗) of the Eight Banners and subsequently held posts as officials which brought both prestige and wealth.[7]\n\n\nAfter the Plain White Banner was put under the direct jurisdiction of the Qing emperor, Cao's family began to serve in civil positions of the Imperial Household Department.\n\n\nDuring the Kangxi Emperor's reign, the clan's prestige and power reached its height. Cao Xueqin's grandfather, Cao Yin (曹寅), was a childhood playmate to Kangxi while Cao Yin's mother, Lady Sun (孫氏), was Kangxi's wet nurse. Two years after his ascension, Kangxi appointed Cao Xueqin's great-grandfather, Cao Xi (曹璽), as the Commissioner of Imperial Textiles (織造) in Jiangning (present-day Nanjing), and the family relocated there.[8]\n\n\nWhen Cao Xi died in 1684, Cao Yin, as Kangxi's personal confidant, took over the post. Cao Yin was one of the era's most prominent men of letters and a keen book collector. Jonathan Spence notes the strong Manchu element in the lives of these Imperial Household bond servants. They balanced the two cultures: Cao Yin took pleasure in horse riding and hunting and Manchu military culture, but was at the same time a sensitive interpreter of Chinese culture to the Manchus. By the early 18th century, the Cao clan had become so rich and influential as to be able to play host four times to the Kangxi Emperor in his six separate itinerant trips south to the Nanjing region. In 1705, the emperor ordered Cao Yin, himself a poet, to compile all surviving *shi* (lyric poems) from the Tang dynasty, which resulted in *The Complete Poems of the Tang*.[8]\n\n\nWhen Cao Yin died in 1712, Kangxi passed the office over to Cao Yin's only son, Cao Yong (曹顒). Cao Yong died in 1715. Kangxi then allowed the family to adopt a paternal nephew, Cao Fu (曹頫), as Cao Yin's posthumous son to continue in that position. Hence the clan held the office of Imperial Textile Commissioner at Jiangning for three generations.\n\n\nThe family's fortunes lasted until Kangxi's death and the ascension of the Yongzheng Emperor to the throne. Yongzheng severely attacked the family and in 1727 confiscated their properties, while Cao Fu was thrown in jail.[7] This was ostensibly for their mismanagement of funds, though perhaps this purge was politically motivated. When Cao Fu was released a year later, the impoverished family was forced to relocate to Beijing. Cao Xueqin, still a young child, lived in poverty with his family.\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cao Xueqin Memorial Museum in Nanjing.\nAlmost no records of Cao's early childhood and adulthood have survived. Redology scholars are still debating Cao's exact date of birth, though he is known to have been around forty to fifty at his death.[9] Cao Xueqin was the son of either Cao Fu or Cao Yong.[10] It is known for certain that Cao Yong's only son was born posthumously in 1715; some Redologists believe this son might be Cao Xueqin. In the clan register (五慶堂曹氏宗譜), however, Cao Yong's only son was recorded as a certain Cao Tianyou (曹天佑). Further complicating matters for Redologists is the fact that neither the names Cao Zhan nor Cao Xueqin—names that his contemporaries knew him by—can be traced in the register.[11]\n\n\nMost of what we know about Cao was passed down from his contemporaries and friends.[12] Cao eventually settled in the countryside west of Beijing where he lived the larger part of his later years in poverty selling off his paintings. Cao was recorded as an inveterate drinker. Friends and acquaintances recalled an intelligent, highly talented man who spent a decade working diligently on a work that must have been *Dream of the Red Chamber*. \"Born in the prosperous, finally degenerate.\" Cao Xueqin's family fate has changed from the status like blooming of flowers to the state of decline, making him deeply experience the sorrow of life and the ruthlessness of the world, and also get rid of the mundanity and narrowness of his original social class. The trend of decadence also brought disillusionment and sentimentality. His tragic experience, his poetic emotion, his spirit of exploration, and his sense of innovation are all cast into \"Dream of the Red Chamber\". They praised both his stylish paintings, particularly of cliffs and rocks, and originality in poetry, which they likened to Li He's. Cao died some time in 1763 or 1764, leaving his novel in a very advanced stage of completion. (At least the first draft had been completed, some pages of the manuscript were lost after being borrowed by friends or relatives.) He was survived by a wife after the death of a son.\n\n\nCao achieved posthumous fame through his life's work. *Dream of the Red Chamber* is a vivid recreation of an illustrious family at its height and its subsequent downfall, and the novel was \"semi-autobiographical\" in nature.[13] A small group of close family and friends appeared to have been transcribing his manuscript when Cao died quite suddenly in 1763–4, apparently out of grief owing to the death of a son. Extant handwritten copies of this work—some 80 chapters—had been in circulation in Beijing shortly after Cao's death and scribal copies soon became prized collectors' items.\n\n\nIn 1791, Cheng Weiyuan (程偉元) and Gao E (高鶚), who claimed to have access to Cao's working papers, edited and published a \"complete\" 120-chapter version. This was its first woodblock print edition. Reprinted a year later with more revisions, this 120-chapter edition is the novel's most printed version. Many modern scholars question the authorship of the last 40 chapters of the novel, whether it was actually completed by Cao Xueqin.[2]\n\n\nTo this very day, Cao continues to be influential on new generations of Chinese novelists and poets, such as Middle Generation's An Qi, who paid homage to him in her poem *To Cao Xueqin*.[14]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![](image)Literature portal\n* ![icon](image)Novels portal\n* ![icon](image)Poetry portal\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n\n\n* Chinese literature\n* List of Chinese authors\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The precise dating of Cao Xueqin's birth and death is a matter of heated debate amongst Chinese Redologists. It would be fair however to confine Cao's birth date to between 1715 and 1724, as attested by the elegiac poems by his friends – Duncheng (敦誠) and Zhang Yiquan (張宜泉) – which stated Cao was forty and nearly fifty respectively when he died.

His novels and short stories are widely read today.[2][3]\n\n\nBorn in Portsmouth, Dickens left school at the age of 12 to work in a boot-blacking factory when his father John was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. After three years he returned to school, before he began his literary career as a journalist. Dickens edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed readings extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, for education, and for other social reforms.\n\n\nDickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of *The Pickwick Papers*, a publishing phenomenon—thanks largely to the introduction of the character Sam Weller in the fourth episode—that sparked *Pickwick* merchandise and spin-offs. Within a few years, Dickens had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most of them published in monthly or weekly installments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.[4][5] Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense.[6] The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback.[5] For example, when his wife's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in *David Copperfield* seemed to reflect her own disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features.[7] His plots were carefully constructed and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives.[8] Masses of the illiterate poor would individually pay a halfpenny to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.[9]\n\n\nHis 1843 novella *A Christmas Carol* remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every creative medium. *Oliver Twist* and *Great Expectations* are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel *A Tale of Two Cities* (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.[10] The term *Dickensian* is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dickens family\n\n![](image)Charles Dickens's birthplace, 393 Commercial Road, Portsmouth\n![photograph](image)2 Ordnance Terrace, Chatham, Dickens's home 1817 – May 1821[13]\nCharles Dickens was born on 7 February 1812 at 1 Mile End Terrace (now 393 Commercial Road), Landport in Portsea Island (Portsmouth), Hampshire, the second of eight children of Elizabeth Dickens (née Barrow; 1789–1863) and John Dickens (1785–1851). His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam,[14] rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles. Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens's novel *Dombey and Son* (1848).[14]\n\n\nIn January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London, and the family moved to Norfolk Street, Fitzrovia.[15] When Charles was four, they relocated to Sheerness and thence to Chatham, Kent, where he spent his formative years until the age of 11. His early life seems to have been idyllic, though he thought himself a \"very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy\".[16]\n\n\nCharles spent time outdoors, but also read voraciously, including the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding, as well as *Robinson Crusoe* and *Gil Blas*. He read and re-read *The Arabian Nights* and the Collected Farces of Elizabeth Inchbald.[17] At the age of 7 he first saw Joseph Grimaldi—the father of modern clowning—perform at the Star Theatre, Rochester.[18] He later imitated Grimaldi's clowning on several occasions, and would also edit the *Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi*.[19][nb 1] He retained poignant memories of childhood, helped by an excellent memory of people and events, which he used in his writing.[22] His father's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education, first at a dame school and then at a school run by William Giles, a dissenter, in Chatham.[23]\n\n\n\n![drawing](image)Illustration by Fred Bernard of Dickens at work in a shoe-blacking factory after his father had been sent to the Marshalsea, published in the 1892 edition of Forster's *Life of Charles Dickens*[24]\nThis period came to an end in June 1822, when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at Somerset House and the family (except for Charles, who stayed behind to finish his final term at school) moved to Camden Town in London.[25] The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts and, living beyond his means,[26] John Dickens was forced by his creditors into the Marshalsea debtors' prison in Southwark, London in 1824. His wife and youngest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time. Charles, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town.[27] Mrs Roylance was \"a reduced impoverished old lady, long known to our family\", whom Dickens later immortalised, \"with a few alterations and embellishments\", as \"Mrs Pipchin\" in *Dombey and Son*. Later, he lived in a back-attic in the house of an agent for the Insolvent Court, Archibald Russell, \"a fat, good-natured, kind old gentleman ... with a quiet old wife\" and lame son, in Lant Street in Southwark.[28] They provided the inspiration for the Garlands in *The Old Curiosity Shop*.[29]\n\n\nOn Sundays – with his sister Frances, free from her studies at the Royal Academy of Music – he spent the day at the Marshalsea.[30] Dickens later used the prison as a setting in *Little Dorrit*. To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's Blacking Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present Charing Cross railway station, where he earned six shillings a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered \"how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age\".[31] As he recalled to John Forster (from *Life of Charles Dickens*):\n\n\n\n\n> The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.[31]\n> \n> \n\n\nWhen the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart, busy district of Covent Garden, the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street. Small audiences gathered and watched them at work – in Dickens's biographer Simon Callow's estimation, the public display was \"a new refinement added to his misery\".[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Marshalsea around 1897, after it had closed. Dickens based several of his characters on the experience of seeing his father in the debtors' prison, most notably Amy Dorrit from *Little Dorrit*.\nA few months after his imprisonment, John Dickens's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, died and bequeathed him £450. On the expectation of this legacy, Dickens was released from prison. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act, Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors, and he and his family left the Marshalsea,[33] for the home of Mrs Roylance.\n\n\nCharles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not immediately support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse. This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: \"I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back.\" His mother's failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women.[34]\n\n\nRighteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which working-class people lived became major themes of his works, and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite, and most autobiographical, novel, *David Copperfield*:[35] \"I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no assistance, no support, of any kind, from anyone, that I can call to mind, as I hope to go to heaven!\"[36]\n\n\nDickens was eventually sent to the Wellington House Academy in Camden Town, where he remained until March 1827, having spent about two years there. He did not consider it to be a good school: \"Much of the haphazard, desultory teaching, poor discipline punctuated by the headmaster's sadistic brutality, the seedy ushers and general run-down atmosphere, are embodied in Mr Creakle's Establishment in *David Copperfield*.\"[36]\n\n\nDickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore, attorneys, of Holborn Court, Gray's Inn, as a junior clerk from May 1827 to November 1828. He was a gifted mimic and impersonated those around him: clients, lawyers and clerks. He went to theatres obsessively: he claimed that for at least three years he went to the theatre every day. His favourite actor was Charles Mathews and Dickens learnt his \"monopolylogues\" (farces in which Mathews played every character) by heart.[37] Then, having learned Gurney's system of shorthand in his spare time, he left to become a freelance reporter. A distant relative, Thomas Charlton, was a freelance reporter at Doctors' Commons and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years.[38][39] This education was to inform works such as *Nicholas Nickleby*, *Dombey and Son* and especially *Bleak House*, whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of Dickens's own views regarding, particularly, the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to \"go to law\".\n\n\nIn 1830, Dickens met his first love, Maria Beadnell, thought to have been the model for the character Dora in *David Copperfield*. Maria's parents disapproved of the courtship and ended the relationship by sending her to school in Paris.[40]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Journalism and writing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Catherine Hogarth Dickens by Samuel Laurence (1838). She met the author in 1834, and they became engaged the following year before marrying in April 1836.\nIn 1832, at the age of 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident.[41] He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame. Drawn to the theatre – he became an early member of the Garrick Club[42] – he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager George Bartley and the actor Charles Kemble were to see him. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold. Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer.[43]\n\n\nIn 1833, Dickens submitted his first story, \"A Dinner at Poplar Walk\", to the London periodical *Monthly Magazine*.[44] William Barrow, Dickens's uncle on his mother's side, offered him a job on *The Mirror of Parliament* and he worked in the House of Commons for the first time early in 1832. He rented rooms at Furnival's Inn and worked as a political journalist, reporting on Parliamentary debates, and he travelled across Britain to cover election campaigns for the *Morning Chronicle*. His journalism, in the form of sketches in periodicals, formed his first collection of pieces, published in 1836: *Sketches by Boz* – Boz being a family nickname he employed as a pseudonym for some years.[45][46] Dickens apparently adopted it from the nickname 'Moses', which he had given to his youngest brother Augustus Dickens, after a character in Oliver Goldsmith's *The Vicar of Wakefield*. When pronounced by anyone with a head cold, \"Moses\" became \"Boses\" – later shortened to *Boz*.[46][47] Dickens's own name was considered \"queer\" by a contemporary critic, who wrote in 1849: \"Mr Dickens, as if in revenge for his own queer name, does bestow still queerer ones upon his fictitious creations.\" Dickens contributed to and edited journals throughout his literary career.[44] In January 1835, the *Morning Chronicle* launched an evening edition, under the editorship of the *Chronicle*'s music critic, George Hogarth. Hogarth invited him to contribute *Street Sketches* and Dickens became a regular visitor to his Fulham house – excited by Hogarth's friendship with Walter Scott (whom Dickens greatly admired) and enjoying the company of Hogarth's three daughters: Georgina, Mary and 19-year-old Catherine.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)The wise-cracking, warm-hearted servant Sam Weller from *The Pickwick Papers*—a publishing phenomenon that sparked numerous spin-offs and *Pickwick* merchandise—made the 24-year-old Dickens famous.[49]\nDickens made rapid progress both professionally and socially. He began a friendship with William Harrison Ainsworth, the author of the highwayman novel *Rookwood* (1834), whose bachelor salon in Harrow Road had become the meeting place for a set that included Daniel Maclise, Benjamin Disraeli, Edward Bulwer-Lytton and George Cruikshank. All these became his friends and collaborators, with the exception of Disraeli, and he met his first publisher, John Macrone, at the house.[50] The success of *Sketches by Boz* led to a proposal from publishers Chapman and Hall for Dickens to supply text to match Robert Seymour's engraved illustrations in a monthly letterpress. Seymour committed suicide after the second instalment and Dickens, who wanted to write a connected series of sketches, hired \"Phiz\" to provide the engravings (which were reduced from four to two per instalment) for the story. The resulting story became *The Pickwick Papers* and, although the first few episodes were not successful, the introduction of the Cockney character Sam Weller in the fourth episode (the first to be illustrated by Phiz) marked a sharp climb in its popularity.[51] The final instalment sold 40,000 copies.[44] On the impact of the character, *The Paris Review* stated, \"arguably the most historic bump in English publishing is the Sam Weller Bump.\"[49] A publishing phenomenon, John Sutherland called *The Pickwick Papers* \"[t]he most important single novel of the Victorian era\".[52] The unprecedented success led to numerous spin-offs and merchandise including *Pickwick* cigars, playing cards, china figurines, Sam Weller puzzles, Weller boot polish and joke books.[49]\n\n\n\n\n> The Sam Weller Bump testifies not merely to Dickens's comic genius but to his acumen as an \"authorpreneur\", a portmanteau he inhabited long before *The Economist* took it up. For a writer who made his reputation crusading against the squalor of the Industrial Revolution, Dickens was a creature of capitalism; he used everything from the powerful new printing presses to the enhanced advertising revenues to the expansion of railroads to sell more books. Dickens ensured that his books were available in cheap bindings for the lower orders as well as in morocco-and-gilt for people of quality; his ideal readership included everyone from the pickpockets who read *Oliver Twist* to Queen Victoria, who found it \"exceedingly interesting\".\n> \n> \n> — How *The Pickwick Papers* Launched Charles Dickens's Career, *The Paris Review*.[49]\n> \n\n\n\nOn the creation of modern mass culture, Nicholas Dames in *The Atlantic* writes, \"'Literature' is not a big enough category for *Pickwick*. It defined its own, a new one that we have learned to call 'entertainment'.\"[53] In November 1836, Dickens accepted the position of editor of *Bentley's Miscellany*, a position he held for three years, until he fell out with the owner.[54] In 1836, as he finished the last instalments of *The Pickwick Papers*, he began writing the beginning instalments of *Oliver Twist* – writing as many as 90 pages a month – while continuing work on *Bentley's* and also writing four plays, the production of which he oversaw. *Oliver Twist*, published in 1838, became one of Dickens's better known stories and was the first Victorian novel with a child protagonist.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Young Charles Dickens by Daniel Maclise, 1839\nOn 2 April 1836, after a one-year engagement, and between episodes two and three of *The Pickwick Papers*, Dickens married Catherine Thomson Hogarth (1815–1879), the daughter of George Hogarth, editor of the *Evening Chronicle*.[56] They were married in St Luke's Church,[57] Chelsea, London. After a brief honeymoon in Chalk in Kent, the couple returned to lodgings at Furnival's Inn.[58] The first of their ten children, Charles, was born in January 1837 and a few months later the family set up home in Bloomsbury at 48 Doughty Street, London (on which Charles had a three-year lease at £80 a year) from 25 March 1837 until December 1839.[56][59] Dickens's younger brother Frederick and Catherine's 17-year-old sister Mary Hogarth moved in with them. Dickens became very attached to Mary, and she died in his arms after a brief illness in 1837. Unusually for Dickens, as a consequence of his shock, he stopped working, and he and Catherine stayed at a little farm on Hampstead Heath for a fortnight. Dickens idealised Mary; the character he fashioned after her, Rose Maylie, he found he could not now kill, as he had planned, in his fiction,[60] and, according to Ackroyd, he drew on memories of her for his later descriptions of Little Nell and Florence Dombey.[61] His grief was so great that he was unable to meet the deadline for the June instalment of *The Pickwick Papers* and had to cancel the *Oliver Twist* instalment that month as well.[55] The time in Hampstead was the occasion for a growing bond between Dickens and John Forster to develop; Forster soon became his unofficial business manager and the first to read his work.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Barnaby Rudge* was Dickens's first popular failure but the character of Dolly Varden, \"pretty, witty, sexy, became central to numerous theatrical adaptations\"[63]\nHis success as a novelist continued. The young Queen Victoria read both *Oliver Twist* and *The Pickwick Papers*, staying up until midnight to discuss them.[64] *Nicholas Nickleby* (1838–39), *The Old Curiosity Shop* (1840–41) and, finally, his first historical novel, *Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty*, as part of the *Master Humphrey's Clock* series (1840–41), were all published in monthly instalments before being made into books.[65]\n\n\nIn the midst of all his activity during this period, there was discontent with his publishers and John Macrone was bought off, while Richard Bentley signed over all his rights in *Oliver Twist*. Other signs of a certain restlessness and discontent emerged; in Broadstairs he flirted with Eleanor Picken, the young fiancée of his solicitor's best friend and one night grabbed her and ran with her down to the sea. He declared they were both to drown there in the \"sad sea waves\". She finally got free, and afterwards kept her distance. In June 1841, he precipitously set out on a two-month tour of Scotland and then, in September 1841, telegraphed Forster that he had decided to go to America.[66] *Master Humphrey's Clock* was shut down, though Dickens was still keen on the idea of the weekly magazine, a form he liked, an appreciation that had begun with his childhood reading of the 18th-century magazines *Tatler* and *The Spectator*.\n\n\nDickens was perturbed by the return to power of the Tories, whom he described as \"people whom, politically, I despise and abhor.\"[67] He had been tempted to stand for the Liberals in Reading, but decided against it due to financial straits.[67] He wrote three anti-Tory verse satires (\"The Fine Old English Gentleman\", \"The Quack Doctor's Proclamation\", and \"Subjects for Painters\") which were published in *The Examiner*.[68]\n\n\n\n\n### First visit to the United States[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 January 1842, Dickens and his wife arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, aboard the RMS *Britannia* during their first trip to the United States and Canada.[69] At this time Georgina Hogarth, another sister of Catherine, joined the Dickens household, now living at Devonshire Terrace, Marylebone to care for the young family they had left behind.[70] She remained with them as housekeeper, organiser, adviser and friend until Dickens's death in 1870.[71] Dickens modelled the character of Agnes Wickfield after Georgina and Mary.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sketch of Dickens in 1842 during his first American tour. Sketch of Dickens's sister Fanny, bottom left\nHe described his impressions in a travelogue, *American Notes for General Circulation*. In *Notes*, Dickens includes a powerful condemnation of slavery which he had attacked as early as *The Pickwick Papers*, correlating the emancipation of the poor in England with the abolition of slavery abroad[73] citing newspaper accounts of runaway slaves disfigured by their masters. In spite of the abolitionist sentiments gleaned from his trip to America, some modern commentators have pointed out inconsistencies in Dickens's views on racial inequality. For instance, he has been criticised for his subsequent acquiescence in Governor Eyre's harsh crackdown during the 1860s Morant Bay rebellion in Jamaica and his failure to join other British progressives in condemning it.[74] From Richmond, Virginia, Dickens returned to Washington, D.C., and started a trek westward, with brief pauses in Cincinnati and Louisville, to St. Louis, Missouri. While there, he expressed a desire to see an American prairie before returning east. A group of 13 men then set out with Dickens to visit Looking Glass Prairie, a trip 30 miles into Illinois.\n\n\nDuring his American visit, Dickens spent a month in New York City, giving lectures, raising the question of international copyright laws and the pirating of his work in America.[75][76] He persuaded a group of 25 writers, headed by Washington Irving, to sign a petition for him to take to Congress, but the press were generally hostile to this, saying that he should be grateful for his popularity and that it was mercenary to complain about his work being pirated.[77]\n\n\nThe popularity he gained caused a shift in his self-perception according to critic Kate Flint, who writes that he \"found himself a cultural commodity, and its circulation had passed out his control\", causing him to become interested in and delve into themes of public and personal personas in the next novels.[78] She writes that he assumed a role of \"influential commentator\", publicly and in his fiction, evident in his next few books.[78] His trip to the U.S. ended with a trip to Canada – Niagara Falls, Toronto, Kingston and Montreal – where he appeared on stage in light comedies.[79]\n\n\n\n![](image)Dickens's portrait by Margaret Gillies, 1843. Painted during the period when he was writing *A Christmas Carol*, it was in the Royal Academy of Arts' 1844 summer exhibition. After viewing it there, Elizabeth Barrett Browning said that it showed Dickens with \"the dust and mud of humanity about him, notwithstanding those eagle eyes\".[80]\n### Return to England[edit]\n\n\nSoon after his return to England, Dickens began work on the first of his Christmas stories, *A Christmas Carol*, written in 1843, which was followed by *The Chimes* in 1844 and *The Cricket on the Hearth* in 1845. Of these, *A Christmas Carol* was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America.[81] The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane Ragged School, caused Dickens to resolve to \"strike a sledge hammer blow\" for the poor. As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became engrossed in the book. He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he \"wept and laughed, and wept again\" as he \"walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed\".[82]\n\n\nAfter living briefly in Italy (1844), Dickens travelled to Switzerland (1846), where he began work on *Dombey and Son* (1846–48). This and *David Copperfield* (1849–50) mark a significant artistic break in Dickens's career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works.\n\n\nAt about this time, he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother, Augustus, worked (John Chapman & Co). It had been carried out by Thomas Powell, a clerk, who was on friendly terms with Dickens and who had acted as mentor to Augustus when he started work. Powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day. After further fraudulent activities, Powell fled to New York and published a book called *The Living Authors of England* with a chapter on Charles Dickens, who was not amused by what Powell had written. One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey (*Dombey and Son*) on Thomas Chapman, one of the principal partners at John Chapman & Co. Dickens immediately sent a letter to Lewis Gaylord Clark, editor of the New York literary magazine *The Knickerbocker*, saying that Powell was a forger and thief. Clark published the letter in the *New-York Tribune* and several other papers picked up on the story. Powell began proceedings to sue these publications and Clark was arrested. Dickens, realising that he had acted in haste, contacted John Chapman & Co to seek written confirmation of Powell's guilt. Dickens did receive a reply confirming Powell's embezzlement, but once the directors realised this information might have to be produced in court, they refused to make further disclosures. Owing to the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his accusations, Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of court.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dickens presiding over a charity meeting to discuss the future of the College of God's Gift; from *The Illustrated London News*, March 1856\nAngela Burdett Coutts, heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of fallen women of the working class. Coutts envisioned a home that would replace the punitive regimes of existing institutions with a reformative environment conducive to education and proficiency in domestic household chores. After initially resisting, Dickens eventually founded the home, named Urania Cottage, in the Lime Grove area of Shepherd's Bush, which he managed for ten years,[84] setting the house rules, reviewing the accounts and interviewing prospective residents.[85] Emigration and marriage were central to Dickens's agenda for the women on leaving Urania Cottage, from which it is estimated that about 100 women graduated between 1847 and 1859.[86]\n\n\n\n#### Religious views[edit]\n\n\nAs a young man, Dickens expressed a distaste for certain aspects of organised religion. In 1836, in a pamphlet titled *Sunday Under Three Heads*, he defended the people's right to pleasure, opposing a plan to prohibit games on Sundays. \"Look into your churches – diminished congregations and scanty attendance. People have grown sullen and obstinate, and are becoming disgusted with the faith which condemns them to such a day as this, once in every seven. They display their feeling by staying away [from church]. Turn into the streets [on a Sunday] and mark the rigid gloom that reigns over everything around.\"[87][88]\n\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Dickens, c. 1850, National Library of Wales\nDickens honoured the figure of Jesus Christ.[89] He is regarded as a professing Christian.[90] His son, Henry Fielding Dickens, described him as someone who \"possessed deep religious convictions\". In the early 1840s, he had shown an interest in Unitarian Christianity and Robert Browning remarked that \"Mr Dickens is an enlightened Unitarian.\"[91] Professor Gary Colledge has written that he \"never strayed from his attachment to popular lay Anglicanism\".[92] Dickens authored a work called *The Life of Our Lord* (1846), a book about the life of Christ, written with the purpose of sharing his faith with his children and family.[93][94] In a scene from *David Copperfield*, Dickens echoed Geoffrey Chaucer's use of Luke 23:34 from *Troilus and Criseyde* (Dickens held a copy in his library), with G. K. Chesterton writing, \"among the great canonical English authors, Chaucer and Dickens have the most in common.\"[95]\n\n\nDickens disapproved of Roman Catholicism and 19th-century evangelicalism, seeing both as extremes of Christianity and likely to limit personal expression, and was critical of what he saw as the hypocrisy of religious institutions and philosophies like spiritualism, all of which he considered deviations from the true spirit of Christianity, as shown in the book he wrote for his family in 1846.[96][97] While Dickens advocated equal rights for Catholics in England, he strongly disliked how individual civil liberties were often threatened in countries where Catholicism predominated and referred to the Catholic Church as \"that curse upon the world.\"[96] Dickens also rejected the Evangelical conviction that the Bible was the infallible word of God. His ideas on Biblical interpretation were similar to the Liberal Anglican Arthur Penrhyn Stanley's doctrine of \"progressive revelation\".[96] Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky referred to Dickens as \"that great Christian writer\".[98][99]\n\n\n\n## Middle years[edit]\n\n\nIn December 1845, Dickens took up the editorship of the London-based *Daily News*, a liberal paper through which Dickens hoped to advocate, in his own words, \"the Principles of Progress and Improvement, of Education and Civil and Religious Liberty and Equal Legislation.\"[100] Among the other contributors Dickens chose to write for the paper were the radical economist Thomas Hodgskin and the social reformer Douglas William Jerrold, who frequently attacked the Corn Laws.[100][101] Dickens lasted only ten weeks on the job before resigning due to a combination of exhaustion and frustration with one of the paper's co-owners.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)David reaches Canterbury, from *David Copperfield*. The character incorporates many elements of Dickens's own life. Artwork by Frank Reynolds.\nA Francophile, Dickens often holidayed in France and, in a speech delivered in Paris in 1846 in French, called the French \"the first people in the universe\".[102] During his visit to Paris, Dickens met the French literati Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Eugène Scribe, Théophile Gautier, François-René de Chateaubriand and Eugène Sue.[102] In early 1849, Dickens started to write *David Copperfield*. It was published between 1849 and 1850. In Dickens's biography, *Life of Charles Dickens* (1872), John Forster wrote of *David Copperfield*, \"underneath the fiction lay something of the author's life\".[103] It was Dickens's personal favourite among his own novels, as he wrote in the author's preface to the 1867 edition of the novel.[104]\n\n\nIn late November 1851, Dickens moved into Tavistock House where he wrote *Bleak House* (1852–53), *Hard Times* (1854) and *Little Dorrit* (1856).[105] It was here that he indulged in the amateur theatricals described in Forster's *Life of Charles Dickens*.[106] During this period, he worked closely with the novelist and playwright Wilkie Collins. In 1856, his income from writing allowed him to buy Gads Hill Place in Higham, Kent. As a child, Dickens had walked past the house and dreamed of living in it. The area was also the scene of some of the events of Shakespeare's *Henry IV, Part 1* and this literary connection pleased him.[107]\n\n\nDuring this time Dickens was also the publisher, editor and a major contributor to the journals *Household Words* (1850–1859) and *All the Year Round* (1858–1870).[108] In 1854, at the behest of Sir John Franklin's widow Lady Jane, Dickens viciously attacked Arctic explorer John Rae in *Household Words* for his report to the Admiralty, based on interviews with local Inuit, that the members of Franklin's lost expedition had resorted to cannibalism. These attacks would later be expanded on his 1856 play *The Frozen Deep*, which satirizes Rae and the Inuit. 20th century archaeology work in King William Island later confirmed that the members of the Franklin expedition resorted to cannibalism.[109]\n\n\nIn 1855, when Dickens's good friend and Liberal MP Austen Henry Layard formed an Administrative Reform Association to demand significant reforms of Parliament, Dickens joined and volunteered his resources in support of Layard's cause.[110] With the exception of Lord John Russell, who was the only leading politician in whom Dickens had any faith and to whom he later dedicated *A Tale of Two Cities*, Dickens believed that the political aristocracy and their incompetence were the death of England.[111][110] When he and Layard were accused of fomenting class conflict, Dickens replied that the classes were already in opposition and the fault was with the aristocratic class. Dickens used his pulpit in *Household Words* to champion the Reform Association.[111] He also commented on foreign affairs, declaring his support for Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini, helping raise funds for their campaigns and stating that \"a united Italy would be of vast importance to the peace of the world, and would be a rock in Louis Napoleon's way,\" and that \"I feel for Italy almost as if I were an Italian born.\"[112][113][114] Dickens also published dozens of writings in *Household Words* supporting vaccination, including multiple laudations for vaccine pioneer Edward Jenner.[115]\n\n\nFollowing the Indian Mutiny of 1857, Dickens joined in the widespread criticism of the East India Company for its role in the event,[*citation needed*] but reserved his fury for Indians, wishing that he was the commander-in-chief in India so that he would be able to, \"do my utmost to exterminate the Race upon whom the stain of the late cruelties rested.\"[116]\n\n\n\n![](image)Actress Ellen Ternan in 1858. Dickens referred to Ternan as his \"magic circle of one\".\nIn 1857, Dickens hired professional actresses for *The Frozen Deep*, written by him and his protégé, Wilkie Collins. Dickens fell in love with one of the actresses, Ellen Ternan, and this passion was to last the rest of his life.[117] In 1858, when Dickens was 45 and Ternan 18, divorce was nearly unthinkable for someone as famous as he was. After publicly accusing Catherine of not loving their children and suffering from \"a mental disorder\" – statements that disgusted his contemporaries, including Elizabeth Barrett Browning –[118] Dickens attempted to have Catherine institutionalized.[119] When this scheme failed, they separated. When Catherine left, never to see her husband again, she took with her one child, leaving the other children to be raised by her sister Georgina, who chose to stay at Gads Hill.[71]\n\n\nDuring this period, whilst pondering a project to give public readings for his own profit, Dickens was approached through a charitable appeal by Great Ormond Street Hospital to help it survive its first major financial crisis. His \"Drooping Buds\" essay in *Household Words* earlier on 3 April 1852 was considered by the hospital's founders to have been the catalyst for the hospital's success.[120] Dickens, whose philanthropy was well-known, was asked by his friend, the hospital's founder Charles West, to preside over the appeal, and he threw himself into the task, heart and soul.[121] Dickens's public readings secured sufficient funds for an endowment to put the hospital on a sound financial footing; one reading on 9 February 1858 alone raised £3,000.[122][123][124]\n\n\n\n![](image)Dickens at his desk, 1858\nAfter separating from Catherine,[125] Dickens undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours which, together with his journalism, were to absorb most of his creative energies for the next decade, in which he was to write only two more novels.[126] His first reading tour, lasting from April 1858 to February 1859, consisted of 129 appearances in 49 towns throughout England, Scotland and Ireland.[127] Dickens's continued fascination with the theatrical world was written into the theatre scenes in *Nicholas Nickleby*, but more importantly he found an outlet in public readings. In 1866, he undertook a series of public readings in England and Scotland, with more the following year in England and Ireland.[128]\n\n\n\nFile:A Tale of Two Cities. The restaurant where Darnay is taken to \"restore himself\" after his liberation.jpegDickens was a regular patron at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese pub in London. He included the venue in *A Tale of Two Cities*.\nOther works soon followed, including *A Tale of Two Cities* (1859) and *Great Expectations* (1861), which were resounding successes. Set in London and Paris, *A Tale of Two Cities* is his best-known work of historical fiction and includes the famous opening sentence which begins with \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\" It is regularly cited as one of the best-selling novels of all time.[129][130] Themes in *Great Expectations* include wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil.[131]\n\n\nIn early September 1860, in a field behind Gads Hill, Dickens made a bonfire of most of his correspondence; only those letters on business matters were spared. Since Ellen Ternan also destroyed all of his letters to her,[132] the extent of the affair between the two remains speculative.[133] In the 1930s, Thomas Wright recounted that Ternan had unburdened herself to a Canon Benham and gave currency to rumours they had been lovers.[134] That the two had a son who died in infancy was alleged by Dickens's daughter, Kate Perugini, whom Gladys Storey had interviewed before her death in 1929. Storey published her account in *Dickens and Daughter*,[135][136] but no contemporary evidence exists. On his death, Dickens settled an annuity on Ternan which made her financially independent. Claire Tomalin's book *The Invisible Woman* argues that Ternan lived with Dickens secretly for the last 13 years of his life. The book was subsequently turned into a play, *Little Nell*, by Simon Gray, and a 2013 film. During the same period Dickens furthered his interest in the paranormal becoming one of the early members of The Ghost Club.[137]\n\n\nIn June 1862, he was offered £10,000 for a reading tour of Australia.[138] He was enthusiastic, and even planned a travel book, *The Uncommercial Traveller Upside Down*, but ultimately decided against the tour.[139] Two of his sons, Alfred D'Orsay Tennyson Dickens and Edward Bulwer Lytton Dickens, migrated to Australia, Edward becoming a member of the Parliament of New South Wales as Member for Wilcannia between 1889 and 1894.[140][141]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aftermath of the Staplehurst rail crash in 1865\nOn 9 June 1865, while returning from Paris with Ellen Ternan, Dickens was involved in the Staplehurst rail crash in Kent. The train's first seven carriages plunged off a cast iron bridge that was under repair. The only first-class carriage to remain on the track was the one in which Dickens was travelling. Before rescuers arrived, Dickens tended and comforted the wounded and the dying with a flask of brandy and a hat refreshed with water, and saved some lives. Before leaving, he remembered the unfinished manuscript for *Our Mutual Friend*, and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it.[142]\n\n\nDickens later used the experience of the crash as material for his short ghost story, \"The Signal-Man\", in which the central character has a premonition of his own death in a rail crash. He also based the story on several previous rail accidents, such as the Clayton Tunnel rail crash in Sussex of 1861. Dickens managed to avoid an appearance at the inquest to avoid disclosing that he had been travelling with Ternan and her mother, which would have caused a scandal.[143] After the crash, Dickens was nervous when travelling by train and would use alternative means when available.[144] In 1868 he wrote, \"I have sudden vague rushes of terror, even when riding in a hansom cab, which are perfectly unreasonable but quite insurmountable.\" Dickens's son, Henry, recalled, \"I have seen him sometimes in a railway carriage when there was a slight jolt. When this happened he was almost in a state of panic and gripped the seat with both hands.\"[144]\n\n\n\n### Second visit to the United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crowd of spectators buying tickets for a Dickens reading at Steinway Hall, New York City in 1867\nWhile he contemplated a second visit to the United States, the outbreak of the Civil War in America in 1861 delayed his plans. On 9 November 1867, over two years after the war, Dickens set sail from Liverpool for his second American reading tour. Landing in Boston, he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his American publisher, James T. Fields. In early December, the readings began. He performed 76 readings, netting £19,000, from December 1867 to April 1868.[145] Dickens shuttled between Boston and New York, where he gave 22 readings at Steinway Hall. Although he had started to suffer from what he called the \"true American catarrh\", he kept to a schedule that would have challenged a much younger man, even managing to squeeze in some sleighing in Central Park.[146]\n\n\n\nDuring his travels, he saw a change in the people and the circumstances of America. His final appearance was at a banquet the American Press held in his honour at Delmonico's on 18 April, when he promised never to denounce America again. By the end of the tour Dickens could hardly manage solid food, subsisting on champagne and eggs beaten in sherry. On 23 April he boarded the Cunard liner *Russia* to return to Britain,[147] barely escaping a federal tax lien against the proceeds of his lecture tour.[148]\n\n\n### Farewell readings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Poster promoting a reading by Dickens in Nottingham dated 4 February 1869, two months before he had a mild stroke\nIn 1868–69, Dickens gave a series of \"farewell readings\" in England, Scotland and Ireland, beginning on 6 October. He managed, of a contracted 100 readings, to give 75 in the provinces, with a further 12 in London.[145] As he pressed on he was affected by giddiness and fits of paralysis. He had a stroke on 18 April 1869 in Chester.[149] He collapsed on 22 April 1869, at Preston, Lancashire; on doctor's advice, the tour was cancelled.[150] After further provincial readings were cancelled, he began work on his final novel, *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*. It was fashionable in the 1860s to 'do the slums' and, in company, Dickens visited opium dens in Shadwell, where he witnessed an elderly addict called \"Laskar Sal\", who formed the model for \"Opium Sal\" in *Edwin Drood*.[151]\n\n\nAfter Dickens regained enough strength, he arranged, with medical approval, for a final series of readings to partly make up to his sponsors what they had lost due to his illness. There were 12 performances, on 11 January to 15 March 1870; the last at 8:00pm at St. James's Hall, London. Though in grave health by then, he read *A Christmas Carol* and *The Trial from Pickwick*. On 2 May, he made his last public appearance at a Royal Academy banquet in the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, paying a special tribute on the death of his friend, illustrator Daniel Maclise.[152]\n\n\n\n### Death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nSamuel Luke Fildes *– The Empty Chair*. Fildes was illustrating *Edwin Drood* at the time of Dickens's death. The engraving shows Dickens's empty chair in his study at Gads Hill Place. It appeared in the Christmas 1870 edition of *The Graphic* and thousands of prints of it were sold.[153]\n![](image)\nDickens's grave in Westminster Abbey\n![](image)\nA 1905 transcribed copy of the death certificate of Charles Dickens\n\nOn 8 June 1870, Dickens had another stroke at his home after a full day's work on *Edwin Drood*. He never regained consciousness and, the next day, he died at Gads Hill Place. Biographer Claire Tomalin has suggested Dickens was actually in Peckham when he had had the stroke and his mistress Ellen Ternan and her maids had him taken back to Gads Hill so that the public would not know the truth about their relationship.[154] Contrary to his wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral \"in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner\",[155] he was laid to rest in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads:\n\n\n\n\n> To the Memory of Charles Dickens (England's most popular author) who died at his residence, Higham, near Rochester, Kent, 9 June 1870, aged 58 years. He was a sympathiser with the poor, the suffering, and the oppressed; and by his death, one of England's greatest writers is lost to the world.[156]\n> \n> \n\n\nA letter from Dickens to the Clerk of the Privy Council in March indicates he'd been offered and had accepted a baronetcy, which was not gazetted before his death.[157] His last words were \"On the ground\", in response to his sister-in-law Georgina's request that he lie down.[158][nb 2] On Sunday, 19 June 1870, five days after Dickens was buried in the Abbey, Dean Arthur Penrhyn Stanley delivered a memorial elegy, lauding \"the genial and loving humorist whom we now mourn\", for showing by his own example \"that even in dealing with the darkest scenes and the most degraded characters, genius could still be clean, and mirth could be innocent\". Pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelist's grave, Stanley assured those present that \"the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one with both the New World and the Old, as that of the representative of literature, not of this island only, but of all who speak our English tongue.\"[159]\n\n\nIn his will, drafted more than a year before his death, Dickens left the care of his £80,000 estate (£9,668,700 in 2023)[160] to his long-time colleague John Forster and his \"best and truest friend\" Georgina Hogarth who, along with Dickens's two sons, also received a tax-free sum of £8,000 (equivalent to £967,000 in 2023).[160] Although Dickens and his wife had been separated for several years at the time of his death, he provided her with an annual income of £600 (£72,500 in 2023)[160] and made her similar allowances in his will. He also bequeathed £19 19s (£2,400 in 2023)[160] to each servant in his employment at the time of his death.[161]\n\n\n\n## Literary style[edit]\n\n\nDickens's approach to the novel is influenced by various things, including the picaresque novel tradition,[162] melodrama[163] and the novel of sensibility.[164] According to Ackroyd, other than these, perhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the fables of *The Arabian Nights*.[165] Satire and irony are central to the picaresque novel.[166] Comedy is also an aspect of the British picaresque novel tradition of Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett. Fielding's *Tom Jones* was a major influence on the 19th-century novelist including Dickens, who read it in his youth[167] and named a son Henry Fielding Dickens after him.[168][169] Influenced by Gothic fiction—a literary genre that began with *The Castle of Otranto* (1764) by Horace Walpole—Dickens incorporated Gothic imagery, settings and plot devices in his works.[170] Victorian gothic moved from castles and abbeys into contemporary urban environments: in particular London, such as Dickens's *Oliver Twist* and *Bleak House*. The jilted bride Miss Havisham from *Great Expectations* is one of Dickens's best-known gothic creations; living in a ruined mansion, her bridal gown effectively doubles as her funeral shroud.[171]\n\n\nNo other writer had such a profound influence on Dickens as William Shakespeare. On Dickens's veneration of Shakespeare, Alfred Harbage wrote in *A Kind of Power: The Shakespeare-Dickens Analogy* (1975) that \"No one is better qualified to recognise literary genius than a literary genius\".[172] Regarding Shakespeare as \"the great master\" whose plays \"were an unspeakable source of delight\", Dickens's lifelong affinity with the playwright included seeing theatrical productions of his plays in London and putting on amateur dramatics with friends in his early years.[172] In 1838, Dickens travelled to Stratford-upon-Avon and visited the house in which Shakespeare was born, leaving his autograph in the visitors' book. Dickens would draw on this experience in his next work, *Nicholas Nickleby* (1838–39), expressing the strength of feeling experienced by visitors to Shakespeare's birthplace: the character Mrs Wititterly states, \"I don't know how it is, but after you've seen the place and written your name in the little book, somehow or other you seem to be inspired; it kindles up quite a fire within one.\"[173]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Dickens's Dream* by Robert William Buss, portraying Dickens at his desk at Gads Hill Place surrounded by many of his characters\nDickens's writing style is marked by a profuse linguistic creativity.[174] Satire, flourishing in his gift for caricature, is his forte. An early reviewer compared him to Hogarth for his keen practical sense of the ludicrous side of life, though his acclaimed mastery of varieties of class idiom may in fact mirror the conventions of contemporary popular theatre.[175] Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving what one critic calls an \"allegorical impetus\" to the novels' meanings.[174] To cite one of numerous examples, the name Mr Murdstone in *David Copperfield* conjures up twin allusions to murder and stony coldness.[176] His literary style is also a mixture of fantasy and realism. His satires of British aristocratic snobbery – he calls one character the \"Noble Refrigerator\" – are often popular. Comparing orphans to stocks and shares, people to tug boats or dinner-party guests to furniture are just some of Dickens's acclaimed flights of fancy.\n\n\nThe author worked closely with his illustrators, supplying them with a summary of the work at the outset and thus ensuring that his characters and settings were exactly how he envisioned them. He briefed the illustrator on plans for each month's instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them. Marcus Stone, illustrator of *Our Mutual Friend*, recalled that the author was always \"ready to describe down to the minutest details the personal characteristics, and ... life-history of the creations of his fancy\".[177] Dickens employs Cockney English in many of his works, denoting working-class Londoners. Cockney grammar appears in terms such as ain't, and consonants in words are frequently omitted, as in 'ere (here) and wot (what).[178] An example of this usage is in *Oliver Twist*. The Artful Dodger uses cockney slang which is juxtaposed with Oliver's 'proper' English, when the Dodger repeats Oliver saying \"seven\" with \"sivin\".[179]\n\n\n\n### Characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Old Curiosity Shop in Holborn, London, which inspired *The Old Curiosity Shop*. Many of Dickens's works do not just use London as a backdrop; they are also about the city and its character.\nDickens's biographer Claire Tomalin regards him as the greatest creator of character in English fiction after Shakespeare.[180]\nDickensian characters are amongst the most memorable in English literature, especially so because of their typically whimsical names. The likes of Ebenezer Scrooge, Tiny Tim, Jacob Marley and Bob Cratchit (*A Christmas Carol*); Oliver Twist, The Artful Dodger, Fagin and Bill Sikes (*Oliver Twist*); Pip, Miss Havisham and Abel Magwitch (*Great Expectations*); Sydney Carton, Charles Darnay and Madame Defarge (*A Tale of Two Cities*); David Copperfield, Uriah Heep and Mr Micawber (*David Copperfield*); Daniel Quilp and Nell Trent (*The Old Curiosity Shop*), Samuel Pickwick and Sam Weller (*The Pickwick Papers*); and Wackford Squeers (*Nicholas Nickleby*) are so well known as to be part and parcel of popular culture, and in some cases have passed into ordinary language: a *scrooge*, for example, is a miser or someone who dislikes Christmas festivity.[181]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Artful Dodger from *Oliver Twist*. His dialect is rooted in Cockney English.\nHis characters were often so memorable that they took on a life of their own outside his books. \"Gamp\" became a slang expression for an umbrella from the character Mrs Gamp, and \"Pickwickian\", \"Pecksniffian\" and \"Gradgrind\" all entered dictionaries due to Dickens's original portraits of such characters who were, respectively, quixotic, hypocritical and vapidly factual. The character that made Dickens famous, Sam Weller became known for his Wellerisms—one-liners that turned proverbs on their heads.[49] Many were drawn from real life: Mrs Nickleby is based on his mother, although she did not recognise herself in the portrait,[182] just as Mr Micawber is constructed from aspects of his father's 'rhetorical exuberance';[183] Harold Skimpole in *Bleak House* is based on James Henry Leigh Hunt; his wife's dwarfish chiropodist recognised herself in Miss Mowcher in *David Copperfield*.[184][185] Perhaps Dickens's impressions on his meeting with Hans Christian Andersen informed the delineation of Uriah Heep (a term synonymous with sycophant).[186]\n\n\nVirginia Woolf maintained that \"we remodel our psychological geography when we read Dickens\" as he produces \"characters who exist not in detail, not accurately or exactly, but abundantly in a cluster of wild yet extraordinarily revealing remarks\".[187] T. S. Eliot wrote that Dickens \"excelled in character; in the creation of characters of greater intensity than human beings\".[188] One \"character\" vividly drawn throughout his novels is London itself.[189] Dickens described London as a magic lantern, inspiring the places and people in many of his novels.[190] From the coaching inns on the outskirts of the city to the lower reaches of the Thames, all aspects of the capital – Dickens's London – are described over the course of his body of work.[190] Walking the streets (particularly around London) formed an integral part of his writing life, stoking his creativity. Dickens was known to regularly walk at least a dozen miles (19 km) per day, and once wrote, \"If I couldn't walk fast and far, I should just explode and perish.\"[191]\n\n\n\n### Autobiographical elements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An original illustration by Phiz from the novel *David Copperfield*, which is widely regarded as Dickens's most autobiographical work\nAuthors frequently draw their portraits of characters from people they have known in real life. *David Copperfield* is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in *Bleak House* reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright.[192] Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in *Little Dorrit* resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution.[193] Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in *David Copperfield* and Lucie Manette in *A Tale of Two Cities*.[194][nb 3]\n\n\nDickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody.[195]\n\n\n\n### Episodic writing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Advertisement for *Great Expectations*, serialised in the weekly literary magazine *All the Year Round* from December 1860 to August 1861. The advert contains the plot device \"to be continued\".\nA pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction, Dickens wrote most of his major novels in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as *Master Humphrey's Clock* and *Household Words*, later reprinted in book form.[4][5] These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, with the audience more evenly distributed across income levels than previous.[196] His instalment format inspired a narrative that he would explore and develop throughout his career, and the regular cliffhangers made each new episode widely anticipated.[6][196] When *The Old Curiosity Shop* was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in New York harbour, shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, \"Is little Nell dead?\"[197] Dickens was able to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end.\n\n\nAnother important impact of Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation; he toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in *The Old Curiosity Shop*), and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in *Oliver Twist*. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine.[198]\n\n\nAt the helm in popularising cliffhangers and serial publications in Victorian literature,[199] Dickens's influence can also be seen in television soap operas and film series, with *The Guardian* stating that \"the DNA of Dickens's busy, episodic storytelling, delivered in instalments and rife with cliffhangers and diversions, is traceable in everything.\"[200] His serialisation of his novels also drew comments from other writers. In Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson's novel *The Wrecker*, Captain Nares, investigating an abandoned ship, remarked: \"See! They were writing up the log,\" said Nares, pointing to the ink-bottle. \"Caught napping, as usual. I wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels.\"[201]\n\n\n\n### Social commentary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nurse Sarah Gamp (left) from *Martin Chuzzlewit* became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of Florence Nightingale.\nDickens's novels were, among other things, works of social commentary. Simon Callow states, \"From the moment he started to write, he spoke for the people, and the people loved him for it.\"[202] He was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of Victorian society. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that \"Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen\".[203] Dickens's second novel, *Oliver Twist* (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed.[204][205]\n\n\nAt a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world, Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society. Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues – such as sanitation and the workhouse – but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist, but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of this condition is in *Hard Times* (1854), Dickens's only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class. In this work, he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed \"Hands\" by the factory owners; that is, not really \"people\" but rather only appendages of the machines they operated. His writings inspired others, in particular journalists and political figures, to address such problems of class oppression. For example, the prison scenes in *The Pickwick Papers* are claimed to have been influential in having the Fleet Prison shut down. Karl Marx asserted that Dickens \"issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together\".[206] George Bernard Shaw even remarked that *Great Expectations* was more seditious than Marx's *Das Kapital*.[206] The exceptional popularity of Dickens's novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (*Bleak House*, 1853; *Little Dorrit*, 1857; *Our Mutual Friend*, 1865), not only underscored his ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored.\n\n\nIt has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an 'unruly superfluity of material' that, in the gradual dénouement, yields up an unsuspected order, influenced the organisation of Charles Darwin's *On the Origin of Species*.[207]\n\n\n\n### Literary techniques[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bleak House (pictured in the 1920s) in Broadstairs, Kent, where Dickens wrote some of his novels\n![](image)Dickens's chalet in Rochester, Kent where he was writing the last chapters of *Edwin Drood* the day before he died\nDickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in *The Old Curiosity Shop* (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by Oscar Wilde. \"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell\", he said in a famous remark, \"without dissolving into tears ... of laughter.\"[208][209] G. K. Chesterton stated, \"It is not the death of little Nell, but the life of little Nell, that I object to\", arguing that the maudlin effect of his description of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of Dickens's grief, his \"despotic\" use of people's feelings to move them to tears in works like this.[210]\n\n\nThe question as to whether Dickens belongs to the tradition of the sentimental novel is debatable. Valerie Purton, in her book *Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition*, sees him continuing aspects of this tradition, and argues that his \"sentimental scenes and characters [are] as crucial to the overall power of the novels as his darker or comic figures and scenes\", and that \"*Dombey and Son* is [ ... ] Dickens's greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition\".[211] The *Encyclopædia Britannica* online comments that, despite \"patches of emotional excess\", such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in *A Christmas Carol* (1843), \"Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist\".[212]\n\n\nIn *Oliver Twist* Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young pickpockets. While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in *Bleak House* and Amy Dorrit in *Little Dorrit*), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's goal of poignant social commentary. Dickens's fiction, reflecting what he believed to be true of his own life, makes frequent use of coincidence, either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence.[213] For example, Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group. Such coincidences are a staple of 18th-century picaresque novels, such as Henry Fielding's *Tom Jones,* which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth.[214]\n\n\n\n## Reputation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dickens's portrait (top left), in between Shakespeare and Tennyson, on a stained glass window at the Ottawa Public Library, Ottawa, Canada\nDickens was the most popular novelist of his time,[215] and remains one of the best-known and most-read of English authors. His works have never gone out of print,[216] and have been adapted continually for the screen since the invention of cinema,[217] with at least 200 motion pictures and TV adaptations based on Dickens's works documented.[218] Many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own lifetime – early productions included *The Haunted Man* which was performed in the West End's Adelphi Theatre in 1848 – and, as early as 1901, the British silent film *Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost* was made by Walter R. Booth.[219] Contemporaries such as publisher Edward Lloyd cashed in on Dickens's popularity with cheap imitations of his novels, resulting in his own popular 'penny dreadfuls'.[220]\n\n\nDickens created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest British novelist of the Victorian era.[1] From the beginning of his career in the 1830s, his achievements in English literature were compared to those of Shakespeare.[172] Dickens's literary reputation, however, began to decline with the publication of *Bleak House* in 1852–53. Philip Collins calls *Bleak House* \"a crucial item in the history of Dickens's reputation. Reviewers and literary figures during the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s, saw a 'drear decline' in Dickens, from a writer of 'bright sunny comedy ... to dark and serious social' commentary\".[221] *The Spectator* called *Bleak House* \"a heavy book to read through at once ... dull and wearisome as a serial\"; Richard Simpson, in *The Rambler*, characterised *Hard Times* as \"this dreary framework\"; *Fraser's Magazine* thought *Little Dorrit* \"decidedly the worst of his novels\".[222] All the same, despite these \"increasing reservations amongst reviewers and the chattering classes, 'the public never deserted its favourite'\". Dickens's popular reputation remained unchanged, sales continued to rise, and *Household Words* and later *All the Year Round* were highly successful.[222]\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Charles Dickens as he appears when reading.\" Wood engraving from *Harper's Weekly*, 7 December 1867. Author David Lodge called Dickens the \"first writer to be an object of unrelenting public interest and adulation\".[223]\nAs his career progressed, Dickens's fame and the demand for his public readings were unparalleled. In 1868 *The Times* wrote, \"Amid all the variety of 'readings', those of Mr Charles Dickens stand alone.\"[10] A Dickens biographer, Edgar Johnson, wrote in the 1950s: \"It was [always] more than a reading; it was an extraordinary exhibition of acting that seized upon its auditors with a mesmeric possession.\"[10] Juliet John backed the claim for Dickens \"to be called the first self-made global media star of the age of mass culture.\"[223] Comparing his reception at public readings to those of a contemporary pop star, *The Guardian* states, \"People sometimes fainted at his shows. His performances even saw the rise of that modern phenomenon, the 'speculator' or ticket tout (scalpers) – the ones in New York City escaped detection by borrowing respectable-looking hats from the waiters in nearby restaurants.\"[224]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"Dickens's vocal impersonations of his own characters gave this truth a theatrical form: the public reading tour. No other Victorian could match him for celebrity, earnings, and sheer vocal artistry. The Victorians craved the author's multiple voices: between 1853 and his death in 1870, Dickens performed about 470 times.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Peter Garratt in *The Guardian* on Dickens's fame and the demand for his public readings[10]\n\nAmong fellow writers, there was a range of opinions on Dickens. Poet laureate, William Wordsworth (1770–1850), thought him a \"very talkative, vulgar young person\", adding he had not read a line of his work, while novelist George Meredith (1828–1909), found Dickens \"intellectually lacking\".[225] In 1888, Leslie Stephen commented in the *Dictionary of National Biography* that \"if literary fame could be safely measured by popularity with the half-educated, Dickens must claim the highest position among English novelists\".[226] Anthony Trollope's *Autobiography* famously declared Thackeray, not Dickens, to be the greatest novelist of the age. However, both Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky were admirers. Dostoyevsky commented: \"We understand Dickens in Russia, I am convinced, almost as well as the English, perhaps even with all the nuances. It may well be that we love him no less than his compatriots do. And yet how original is Dickens, and how very English!\"[227] Tolstoy referred to *David Copperfield* as his favourite book, and he later adopted the novel as \"a model for his own autobiographical reflections\".[228] French writer Jules Verne called Dickens his favourite writer, writing his novels \"stand alone, dwarfing all others by their amazing power and felicity of expression\".[229] Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh was inspired by Dickens's novels in several of his paintings, such as *Vincent's Chair*, and in an 1889 letter to his sister stated that reading Dickens, especially *A Christmas Carol*, was one of the things that was keeping him from committing suicide.[230] Oscar Wilde generally disparaged his depiction of character, while admiring his gift for caricature.[231] Henry James denied him a premier position, calling him \"the greatest of superficial novelists\": Dickens failed to endow his characters with psychological depth, and the novels, \"loose baggy monsters\",[232] betrayed a \"cavalier organisation\".[233] Joseph Conrad described his own childhood in bleak Dickensian terms, noting he had \"an intense and unreasoning affection\" for *Bleak House* dating back to his boyhood. The novel influenced his own gloomy portrait of London in *The Secret Agent* (1907).[228] Virginia Woolf had a love-hate relationship with Dickens, finding his novels \"mesmerizing\" while reproving him for his sentimentalism and a commonplace style.[234]\n\n\nAround 1940–41, the attitude of the literary critics began to warm towards Dickens – led by George Orwell in *Inside the Whale and Other Essays* (March 1940), Edmund Wilson in *The Wound and the Bow* (1941) and Humphry House in *Dickens and His World*.[235] However, even in 1948, F. R. Leavis, in *The Great Tradition*, asserted that \"the adult mind doesn't as a rule find in Dickens a challenge to an unusual and sustained seriousness\"; Dickens was indeed a great genius, \"but the genius was that of a great entertainer\",[236] though he later changed his opinion with *Dickens the Novelist* (1970, with Q. D. (Queenie) Leavis): \"Our purpose\", they wrote, \"is to enforce as unanswerably as possible the conviction that Dickens was one of the greatest of creative writers\".[237] In 1944, Soviet film director and film theorist Sergei Eisenstein wrote an essay on Dickens's influence on cinema, such as cross-cutting – where two stories run alongside each other, as seen in novels such as *Oliver Twist*.[238]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, \"a substantial reassessment and re-editing of the works began, and critics found his finest artistry and greatest depth to be in the later novels: *Bleak House*, *Little Dorrit*, and *Great Expectations* – and (less unanimously) in *Hard Times* and *Our Mutual Friend*\".[239] Dickens was a favourite author of Roald Dahl; the best-selling children's author would include three of Dickens's novels among those read by the title character in his 1988 novel *Matilda*.[240] An avid reader of Dickens, in 2005, Paul McCartney named *Nicholas Nickleby* his favourite novel. On Dickens he states, \"I like the world that he takes me to. I like his words; I like the language\", adding, \"A lot of my stuff – it's kind of Dickensian.\"[241] Screenwriter Jonathan Nolan's screenplay for *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012) was inspired by *A Tale of Two Cities*, with Nolan calling the depiction of Paris in the novel \"one of the most harrowing portraits of a relatable, recognisable civilisation that completely folded to pieces\".[242] On 7 February 2012, the 200th anniversary of Dickens's birth, Philip Womack wrote in *The Telegraph*: \"Today there is no escaping Charles Dickens. Not that there has ever been much chance of that before. He has a deep, peculiar hold upon us\".[243]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Dickens and Little Nell* statue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nMuseums and festivals celebrating Dickens's life and works exist in many places with which Dickens was associated. These include the Charles Dickens Museum in London, the historic home where he wrote *Oliver Twist*, *The Pickwick Papers* and *Nicholas Nickleby*; and the Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth, the house in which he was born. The original manuscripts of many of his novels, as well as printers' proofs, first editions, and illustrations from the collection of Dickens's friend John Forster are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum.[244] Dickens's will stipulated that no memorial be erected in his honour; nonetheless, a life-size bronze statue of Dickens entitled *Dickens and Little Nell*, cast in 1890 by Francis Edwin Elwell, stands in Clark Park in the Spruce Hill neighbourhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Another life-size statue of Dickens is located at Centennial Park in Sydney, Australia.[245] In 1960 a bas-relief sculpture of Dickens, notably featuring characters from his books, was commissioned from sculptor Estcourt J Clack to adorn the office building built on the site of his former home at 1 Devonshire Terrace, London.[246][*page needed*][247] In 2014, a life-size statue was unveiled near his birthplace in Portsmouth on the 202nd anniversary of his birth; this was supported by his great-great-grandsons, Ian and Gerald Dickens.[248][249]\n\n\n\n![](image)*A Christmas Carol* significantly influenced the modern celebration of Christmas in many countries\n*A Christmas Carol* is most probably his best-known story, with frequent new adaptations. It is also the most-filmed of Dickens's stories, with many versions dating from the early years of cinema.[250] According to the historian Ronald Hutton, the current state of the observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid-Victorian revival of the holiday spearheaded by *A Christmas Carol*. Dickens catalysed the emerging Christmas as a family-centred festival of generosity, in contrast to the dwindling community-based and church-centred observations, as new middle-class expectations arose.[251] Its archetypal figures (Scrooge, Tiny Tim, the Christmas ghosts) entered into Western cultural consciousness. \"Merry Christmas\", a prominent phrase from the tale, was popularised following the appearance of the story.[252] The term Scrooge became a synonym for miser, and his exclamation \"Bah! Humbug!'\", a dismissal of the festive spirit, likewise gained currency as an idiom.[253] The Victorian era novelist William Makepeace Thackeray called the book \"a national benefit, and to every man and woman who reads it a personal kindness\".[250]\n\n\nDickens was commemorated on the Series E £10 note issued by the Bank of England that circulated between 1992 and 2003. His portrait appeared on the reverse of the note accompanied by a scene from *The Pickwick Papers*. The Charles Dickens School is a high school in Broadstairs, Kent. A theme park, Dickens World, standing in part on the site of the former naval dockyard where Dickens's father once worked in the Navy Pay Office, opened in Chatham in 2007. To celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens in 2012, the Museum of London held the UK's first major exhibition on the author in 40 years.[254] In 2002, Dickens was number 41 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[255] American literary critic Harold Bloom placed Dickens among the greatest Western writers of all time.[256] In the 2003 UK survey The Big Read carried out by the BBC, five of Dickens's books were named in the Top 100.[257]\n\n\nActors who have portrayed Dickens on screen include Anthony Hopkins, Derek Jacobi, Simon Callow, Dan Stevens and Ralph Fiennes, the latter playing the author in *The Invisible Woman* (2013) which depicts Dickens's secret love affair with Ellen Ternan which lasted for thirteen years until his death in 1870.[258]\n\n\nDickens and his publications have appeared on a number of postage stamps in countries including: the United Kingdom (1970, 1993, 2011 and 2012 issued by the Royal Mail—their 2012 collection marked the bicentenary of Dickens's birth),[259] the Soviet Union (1962), Antigua, Barbuda, Botswana, Cameroon, Dubai, Fujairah, St Lucia and Turks and Caicos Islands (1970), St Vincent (1987), Nevis (2007), Alderney, Gibraltar, Jersey and Pitcairn Islands (2012), Austria (2013), and Mozambique (2014).[260] In 1976, a crater on the planet Mercury was named in his honour.[261]\n\n\nIn November 2018 it was reported that a previously lost portrait of a 31-year-old Dickens, by Margaret Gillies, had been found in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Gillies was an early supporter of women's suffrage and had painted the portrait in late 1843 when Dickens, aged 31, wrote *A Christmas Carol*. It was exhibited, to acclaim, at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1844.[80] The Charles Dickens Museum is reported to have paid £180,000 for the portrait.[262]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Charles Dickens bibliography\n\nDickens published well over a dozen major novels and novellas, a large number of short stories, including a number of Christmas-themed stories, a handful of plays, and several non-fiction books.\n\n\n\n### Novels and novellas[edit]\n\n\nDickens's novels and novellas were initially serialised in weekly and monthly magazines, then reprinted in standard book formats.\n\n\n\n* *The Pickwick Papers* (*The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club*; monthly serial, April 1836 to November 1837).[263] Novel.\n* *Oliver Twist* (*The Adventures of Oliver Twist*; monthly serial in *Bentley's Miscellany*, February 1837 to April 1839).

I am willing ... to concede that I had not arrived at man's estate when Grimaldi left the stage\".[19] When Dickens arrived in America for the first time in 1842, he stayed at the Tremont House, America's \"pioneer first-class hotel\". Dickens \"bounded into the Tremont's foyer shouting out 'Here we are!', Grimaldi's famous catch-phrase and as such entirely appropriate for a great and cherished entertainer making his entrance upon a new stage.\"[20] Later, Dickens was known to imitate Grimaldi's clowning on several occasions.[21]\n2. **^** A contemporary obituary in *The Times*, alleged that Dickens's last words were: \"Be natural my children. For the writer that is natural has fulfilled all the rules of Art.\" Reprinted from *The Times*, London, August 1870 in Bidwell 1870, p. 223.\n3. **^** Slater also detects Ellen Ternan in the portrayal of Lucie Manette.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Black 2007, p. 735.\n2. **^** Mazzeno 2008, p. 76.\n3. **^** Chesterton 2005, pp. 100–126.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Grossman 2012, p. 54\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Lodge 2002, p. 118.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Tune in next week\". *The New Yorker*. 2 December 2017.

He received several prestigious literary awards for his novella *The Little Prince* (*Le Petit Prince*) and for his lyrical aviation writings, including *Wind, Sand and Stars* and *Night Flight*. They were translated into many languages.\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry was a successful commercial pilot before World War II, working airmail routes in Europe, Africa, and South America. He joined the French Air Force at the start of the war, flying reconnaissance missions until France's armistice with Germany in 1940. After being demobilised by the French Air Force, he travelled to the United States to help persuade its government to enter the war against Nazi Germany.\n\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry spent 28 months in the United States of America, during which he wrote three of his most important works, then joined the Free French Air Force in North Africa, even though he was far past the maximum age for such pilots and in declining health. He disappeared and is believed to have died while on a reconnaissance mission from the French island of Corsica over the Mediterranean on 31 July 1944.[6] Although the wreckage of his plane was discovered off the coast of Marseille in 2000, the ultimate cause of the crash remains unknown.[7]\n\n\n## Youth and aviation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Coat of arms of the de Saint-Exupéry family since the 18th century.![](image)Birthplace of Saint-Exupéry in the Presqu'île section of Lyon, on the street now named after him, in blue at lower left.\nSaint-Exupéry was born in Lyon to an aristocratic Catholic family that could trace its lineage back several centuries, whose name ultimately references the 5th-century bishop Saint Exuperius. He was the third of five children of the Viscountess Marie de Fonscolombe and Viscount Jean de Saint-Exupéry (1863–1904).[8][9][10][Note 1] His father, an executive of the *Le Soleil* (The Sun) insurance brokerage, died of a stroke in the train station of La Foux before his son's fourth birthday. His father's death affected the entire family, transforming their status to that of \"impoverished aristocrats\".[12]\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry had three sisters and a younger blond-haired brother, François, who at age 15 died of rheumatic fever contracted while both were attending the Marianist College Villa St. Jean in Fribourg, Switzerland, during World War I. Saint-Exupéry attended to his brother, his closest confidant, beside François' death bed, and later wrote that François \"...remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a [young] tree falls\", imagery which would much later be recrafted into the climactic ending of *The Little Prince*. At the age of 17, now the only male in the family following the death of his brother, the young author was left as distraught as his mother and sisters, but he soon assumed the mantle of a protector and took to consoling them.[13]\n\n\nAfter twice failing his final exams at a preparatory Naval Academy, Saint-Exupéry entered the École des Beaux-Arts as an auditor to study architecture for 15 months, again without graduating, and then fell into the habit of accepting odd jobs. In 1921, Saint-Exupéry began his military service as a basic-rank soldier with the *2e Régiment de chasseurs à cheval* (2nd Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment) and was sent to Neuhof, near Strasbourg.[14] While there he took private flying lessons and the following year was offered a transfer from the French Army to the French Air Force. He received his pilot's wings after being posted to the 37th Fighter Regiment in Casablanca, Morocco.\n\n\nLater, being reposted to the 34th Aviation Regiment at Le Bourget on the outskirts of Paris, and then experiencing the first of his many aircraft crashes, Saint-Exupéry bowed to the objections of the family of his fiancée, future novelist Louise Lévêque de Vilmorin, and left the air force to take an office job. The couple ultimately broke off their engagement and he worked at several more odd jobs without success over the next few years.[15]\n\n\nBy 1926, Saint-Exupéry was flying again. He became one of the pioneers of international postal flight, in the days when aircraft had few instruments. Later he complained that those who flew the more advanced aircraft had become more like accountants than pilots. He worked for Aéropostale between Toulouse and Dakar, and then also became the airline stopover manager for the Cape Juby airfield in the Spanish zone of South Morocco, in the Sahara desert. His duties included negotiating the safe release of downed fliers taken hostage by Saharan tribes, a perilous task that earned him his first Légion d'honneur from the French Government.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1929, Saint-Exupéry was transferred to Argentina, where he was appointed director of the Aeroposta Argentina airline. He lived in Buenos Aires, in the Galería Güemes building. He surveyed new air routes across South America, negotiated agreements, and even occasionally flew the airmail as well as search missions looking for downed fliers. This period of his life is briefly explored in *Wings of Courage*, an IMAX film by French director Jean-Jacques Annaud.[16]\n\n\n\n## Writing career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saint-Exupéry photographed near Montréal, Québec, in May 1942, on a speaking tour in support of France after its armistice with Germany. Despite his appearance, he had been beleaguered with stress and bedridden with cholecystitis.[17][18]\nSaint-Exupéry's first novella, *L'Aviateur* (*The Aviator*), was published in 1926 in a short-lived literary magazine *Le Navire d'Argent* (*The Silver Ship*).[19] In 1929, his first book, *Courrier Sud* (*Southern Mail*) was published; his career as an aviator and journalist was about to begin. That same year, Saint-Exupéry flew the Casablanca—Dakar route.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe 1931 publication of *Vol de nuit* (*Night Flight*) established Saint-Exupéry as a rising star in the literary world. It was the first of his major works to gain widespread acclaim and won the prix Femina. The novel mirrored his experiences as a mail pilot and director of the Aeroposta Argentina airline, based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.[20] That same year, at Grasse, Saint-Exupéry married Consuelo Suncin (née Suncín Sandoval), a once-divorced, once-widowed Salvadoran writer and artist, who possessed a bohemian spirit and a \"viper's tongue\".\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry, thoroughly enchanted by the diminutive woman, would leave and then return to her many times—she was both his muse and, over the long term, the source of much of his angst.[21] It was a stormy union, with Saint-Exupéry travelling frequently and indulging in numerous affairs, most notably with the Frenchwoman Hélène de Vogüé (1908–2003), known as \"Nelly\" and referred to as \"Madame de B.\" in Saint-Exupéry biographies.[22][Note 2] Vogüé became Saint-Exupéry's literary executrix after his death and also wrote her own Saint-Exupéry biography under a pseudonym, Pierre Chevrier.[24]\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry continued to write until the spring of 1943, when he left the United States with American troops bound for North Africa in the Second World War.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Memorial plaque for Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in Markkleeberg (Germany), 2022. In 1939, he came to see his German publisher Karl Rauch who had printed the first German edition of \"Terre des hommes\".\n## Desert crash[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A monument in Tarfaya, Cape Juby, Morocco, commemorating Aéropostale's mail stopover station and Saint-Exupéry, its manager\nOn 30 December 1935, at 2:45 am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exupéry, along with his mechanic-navigator André Prévot, crashed in the Libyan desert,[26] during an attempt to break the speed record in a Paris-to-Saigon air race and win a prize of 150,000 francs.[27][Note 3] The crash site is thought to have been near the Wadi Natrun valley, close to the Nile Delta.[28]\n\n\nBoth Saint-Exupéry and Prévot miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat. Their maps were primitive and ambiguous, leaving them with no idea of their location. Lost among the sand dunes, their sole supplies consisted of some grapes, two oranges, a madeleine, a pint of coffee in a battered thermos, and a half-pint of white wine in another. They also had with them a small store of medicine: \"a hundred grammes of ninety percent alcohol, the same of pure ether, and a small bottle of Iodine.\"[29]\n\n\nThe pair had only one day worth of fluids.[30] They both saw mirages and experienced auditory hallucinations, which were quickly followed by more vivid hallucinations. By the second and third day, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating. On the fourth day, a Bedouin on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment that saved their lives.[27] The near brush with death would figure prominently in his 1939 memoir, *Wind, Sand and Stars*, winner of several awards. Saint-Exupéry's classic novella *The Little Prince*, which begins with a pilot being stranded in the desert, is, in part, a reference to this experience.[31]\n\n\n\n## Canadian and American sojourn and *The Little Prince*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Little Prince\n\n![](image)The vain and petulant Rose in *The Little Prince* was likely inspired by Saint-Exupéry's Salvadoran wife, Consuelo de Saint Exupéry.\nFollowing the German invasion of France in 1940, Saint-Exupéry flew a Bloch MB.174 with the *Groupe de reconnaissance II/33* reconnaissance squadron of the Armée de l'Air.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter France's armistice with Germany, Saint-Exupéry went into exile in North America, escaping through Portugal. He stayed in Estoril, at the Hotel Palácio, between 28 November and 20 December 1940.[32] He described his impressions of his stay in Lettre à un Otage.[33] On the same day that he checked out, he boarded the *S.S. Siboney* and arrived in New York City on the last day of 1940,[34] with the intention of convincing the U.S. to enter the conflict against Nazi Germany quickly.[35] On 14 January 1941, at a Hotel Astor author luncheon attended by approximately 1,500, he belatedly received his National Book Award for *Wind, Sand and Stars*, won a year earlier while he was occupied witnessing the destruction of the French Army.[36] Consuelo followed him to New York City several months later after a chaotic migration to the southern French town of Oppède, where she lived in an artist's commune, the basis of her autobiography, *Kingdom of the Rocks: Memories of Oppède*.[37][38]\n\n\nBetween January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exupérys lived in New York City's Central Park South in twin penthouse apartments,[39] as well as The Bevin House mansion in Asharoken on Long Island, New York and a townhouse on Beekman Place in Manhattan.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)Two editions of *The Little Prince* (lower left and upper right, artwork not shown) on display at the Saint-Exupéry exhibit at the Air and Space Museum in Paris, France. Also, upper left: *Lettre à un otage* (*Letter to a Hostage*), and bottom right: *Pilote de guerre* (English version: *Flight to Arras*).\nSaint-Exupéry and Charles Lindbergh both became P-38 pilots during World War II, with Lindbergh fighting in the Pacific War,[41] and with Saint-Exupéry fighting and dying over the Mediterranean.[42]\n\n\nIt was after Saint-Exupéry's arrival in the United States that the author adopted the hyphen within his surname, as he was annoyed with Americans addressing him as \"Mr. Exupéry\".[3] It was also during this period that he authored *Pilote de guerre (Flight to Arras)*, which earned widespread acclaim, and *Lettre à un otage* (*Letter to a Hostage*), dedicated to the 40 million French living under Nazi oppression, plus numerous shorter pieces in support of France. The Saint-Exupérys also resided in Quebec City, Canada for several weeks during the late spring of 1942, during which time they met a precocious eight-year-old boy with blond curly hair, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exupérys resided.[43][44][Note 4]\n\n\nAfter he returned from his stay in Québec, which had been fraught with illness and stress, the French wife of one of his publishers helped persuade Saint-Exupéry to produce a children's book,[45] hoping to calm his nerves and also compete with the new series of *Mary Poppins* stories by P.L. Travers. Saint-Exupéry wrote and illustrated *The Little Prince* in New York City and the village of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.[43] It would be first published months later in early 1943 in both English and French in the United States, and would only later appear in his native homeland posthumously after the liberation of France, as his works had been banned by the collaborationist Vichy Regime.[46][47][Note 5]\n\n\n\n## Return to war[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1943, following his 27 months in North America, Saint-Exupéry departed with an American military convoy for Algiers, to fly with the Free French Air Force and fight with the Allies in a Mediterranean-based squadron. Then 43, soon to be promoted to the rank of commandant (major), he was far older than most men in operational units. Although eight years over the age limit for such pilots, he had petitioned endlessly for an exemption which had finally been approved by General Dwight Eisenhower. However, Saint-Exupéry had been suffering pain and immobility due to his many previous crash injuries, to the extent that he could not dress himself in his own flight suit or even turn his head leftwards to check for enemy aircraft.[49]\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry was assigned with a number of other pilots to his former unit, renamed *Groupe de reconnaissance 2/33 \"Savoie\"*, flying P-38 Lightnings, which an officer described as \"war-weary, non-airworthy craft\".[50] The Lightnings were also more sophisticated than models he previously flew, requiring him to undertake seven weeks of stringent training before his first mission. After wrecking a P-38 through engine failure on his second mission, he was grounded for eight months, but was then later reinstated to flight duty on the personal intervention of General Ira Eaker, Deputy Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces.[51][42][Note 6]\n\n\nAfter Saint-Exupéry resumed flying, he also returned to his longtime habit of reading and writing while flying his single-seat Lockheed F-5B (a specially configured P-38 reconnaissance variant). His prodigious studies of literature gripped him and on occasion, he continued his readings of literary works until moments before takeoff, with mechanics having warmed up and tested his aircraft for him in preparation for his flight. On one flight, to the chagrin of his colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the airport for an hour after returning, so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exupéry frequently flew with a lined notebook (*carnet*) during his long solitary flights and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him.[53]\n\n\n\n## Disappearance[edit]\n\n\nBefore his return to flight duty with his squadron in North Africa, the collaborationist Vichy Regime unilaterally promoted Saint-Exupéry as one of its members – quite a shock to the author. Subsequently, French General (later French President) Charles de Gaulle, whom Saint-Exupéry held in low regard, publicly implied that the author-pilot was supporting Germany. Depressed at this, he began to drink heavily.[54] His health, physical and mental, had been deteriorating. Saint-Exupéry was said to be intermittently subject to depression and there was discussion about grounding him.[55][Note 7]\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry's last reconnaissance mission was to collect intelligence on German troop movements in and around the Rhone Valley preceding Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France. Although he had been reinstated to his old squadron with the provision that he was to fly only five missions, on 31 July 1944, he took off in an unarmed P-38 on his ninth reconnaissance mission from an airbase on Corsica.[56][Note 8] To the great alarm of his squadron compatriots, he did not return, vanishing without a trace.[58][Note 9] Word of his disappearance soon spread across the literary world and then it spread into international headlines.[59][42]\n\n\n\n### Discovery at sea[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bracelet of Saint-Exupéry found in 1998\n![](image)Part of the landing gear of Saint-Exupéry's plane, recovered from the Mediterranean, displayed at the French Air and Space Museum\nIn September 1998, to the east of Riou Island (south of Marseille) a fisherman found a silver identity bracelet bearing the names of Saint-Exupéry, his wife Consuelo and his American publisher, Reynal & Hitchcock.[60] The bracelet was hooked to a piece of fabric, presumably from his flight suit.[24] Announcement of the discovery was an emotional event in France, where Saint-Exupéry was a national icon, and some disputed its authenticity because it was found far from his intended flight path, implying that the aircraft might not have been shot down.[61]\n\n\nIn May 2000 a diver found debris from a Lockheed P-38 Lightning submerged off the coast of Marseille, near where the bracelet was found. The discovery galvanized the country, which had conducted searches for his aircraft and speculated on Saint-Exupéry's fate for decades.[62] After a two-year delay imposed by the French government, the remnants of the aircraft were recovered in October 2003.[60][Note 10] In 2004, French officials and investigators from the French Underwater Archaeological Department officially confirmed that the wreckage was from Saint-Exupéry's aircraft.[62][64]\n\n\nNo marks or holes attributable to gunfire were found but that was not considered significant as only a small portion of the aircraft was recovered.[63] In June 2004, the fragments were given to the *Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace* (Air and Space Museum) in Le Bourget, Paris, where Saint-Exupéry's life is commemorated in a special exhibit.[65][66]\n\n\n\n### Speculations in 1948, 1972 and 2008[edit]\n\n\nIn 1948, former Luftwaffe telegrapher Rev. Hermann Korth published his war logs, noting an incident that occurred at around noon on 31 July 1944 in which a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 shot down a P-38 Lightning. Korth's account ostensibly supported a shoot-down hypothesis for Saint-Exupéry.[67][68] The veracity of his log was met with skepticism, because it could have described a P-38 which was flown by Second Lieutenant Gene Meredith on 30 July, shot down south of Nice.[67][69][Note 11]\n\n\nIn 1972, the German magazine *Der Landser* quoted a letter from Luftwaffe reconnaissance pilot Robert Heichele, in which he purportedly claimed to have shot down a P-38 on 31 July 1944.[71] His account, corroborated by a spotter, seemingly supported a shoot-down hypothesis of Saint-Exupéry.[72] Heichele's account was met with skepticism, because he described flying a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 D-9, a variant which had not yet entered Luftwaffe service.[73]\n\n\nIn the lists which are held by the *Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv*, no victory was credited to Heichele or his unit in either July or August 1944, and the decrypted report of the day's reconnaissance does not include any flights by 2./NAG 13's Fw 190s.[74] Heichele was shot down on 16 August 1944 and died five days later.[Note 12][75]\n\n\nIn 2008, a French journalist from *La Provence*, who was investigating Saint-Exupéry's death, contacted former Luftwaffe pilots who flew in the area of Marseille, eventually getting an account from Horst Rippert (1922–2013).[65][76][77] (Rippert was the older brother of the famous bass singer Ivan Rebroff, who was born in Berlin as Hans-Rolf Rippert.) In his memoirs, Horst Rippert, an admirer of Saint-Exupéry's books, expressed both fears and doubts that he was responsible but in 2003 he stated that he became certain that he was responsible when he learned the location of Saint-Exupéry's wreckage.[78] Rippert claimed to have reported the kill over his radio but there are no surviving records to verify this account.[68][69][Note 13][Note 14]\n\n\nRippert's account, as it is discussed in two French and German books, was met with both publicity and skepticism.[80][81] Luftwaffe comrades expressed doubts in Rippert's claim, given that he held it private for 64 years.[82][83][Note 15] Very little German documentation survived the war, and contemporary archival sources, consisting mostly of Allied intercepts of Luftwaffe signals, offer no evidence to verify Rippert's claim.[84][85] The entry and exit points of Saint-Exupéry's mission were likely near Cannes, yet his wreckage was discovered south of Marseille.[79]\n\n\nThough it is possible that German fighters could have intercepted, or at least altered, Saint-Exupéry's flight path, the cause of his death remains unknown, and Rippert's account remains one hypothesis among many.[69][79][86][Note 16]\n\n\n\n## Literary works[edit]\n\n\nWhile not precisely autobiographical, much of Saint-Exupéry's work is inspired by his experiences as a pilot. One notable example is his novella, *The Little Prince,* a poetic tale self-illustrated in watercolours in which a pilot stranded in the desert meets a young prince fallen to Earth from a tiny asteroid. \"His most popular work, *The Little Prince* was partially based upon a crash he and his navigator survived in the Libyan desert. They were stranded and dehydrated for four days, nearing death when they miraculously stumbled upon a Bedouin who gave them water.[88] Saint Exupery would later write in *Wind, Sand and Stars* that the Bedouin saved their lives and gave them \"charity and magnanimity [by] bearing the gift of water.\"[89] *The Little Prince* is a philosophical story, including societal criticism, remarking on the strangeness of the adult world. One biographer wrote of his most famous work: \"Rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and his Little Prince,\" and remarking of their dual fates, \"...the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky.\"[24]\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry's notable literary works (published English translations in parentheses) include:[90]\n\n\n\n* *L'Aviateur* (1926) (*The Aviator*, in the anthology *A Sense of Life*)\n* *Courrier sud* (1929) (*Southern Mail*) – made as a movie in French\n* *Vol de nuit* (1931) (*Night Flight*) – winner of the full prix Femina and made twice as a movie and a TV film, both in English\n* *The Wild Garden* (1938) – Limited to one thousand copies privately printed for the friends of the author and his publishers as a New Year's Greeting. The story is taken from the forthcoming book, *Wind, Sand and Stars*, to be published in the spring of 1939.\n* *Terre des hommes* (1939) – winner of the Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française\n\n\n*Wind, Sand and Stars* (simultaneous distinct English version)[Note 17] – winner of the U.S. National Book Award[92][91]\n* *Pilote de guerre* (1942) (titled in English as: *Flight to Arras*) – winner of the Grand Prix Littéraire de l'Aéro-Club de France[93]\n* *Le petit prince* (1943) (*The Little Prince*), posthumous in France[93] – translated into more than 250 languages and dialects and among the top four selling books in the world;[94] made as both movies and TV films in a number of languages, and adapted to numerous other media in many languages\n* *Lettre à un otage* (1944) (*Letter to a Hostage*, posthumous in English)[95]\n\n\n### Published posthumously[edit]\n\n\n* *Citadelle* (1948) (titled in English: as *The Wisdom of the Sands*) – winner of the Prix des Ambassadeurs\n* *Lettres à une jeune fille* (1950)\n* *Lettres de jeunesse, 1923–1931* (1953)\n* *Lettres à l'amie inventée* (1953)[96]\n* *Carnets* (1953)\n* *Lettres à sa mère* (1955)\n* *Un sens à la vie* (1956), (*A Sense of Life*)[97][98][Note 18]\n* *Lettres de Saint-Exupéry* (1960)\n* *Lettres aux américains* (1960)\n* *Écrits de guerre, 1939–1944* (1982) (*Wartime Writings, 1939–1944*)\n* *Manon, danseuse* (2007)\n* *Lettres à l'inconnue* (1992)\n\n\n### Other works[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 1930s, Saint-Exupéry led a mixed life as an aviator, journalist, author and publicist for Air France, Aéropostale's successor. His journalistic writings for *Paris-Soir*, *Marianne* and other newspapers covered events in Indochina and the Far East (1934), the Mediterranean, Soviet Union and Moscow (1935), and the Spanish Civil War (1936–1937). Saint-Exupéry wrote a number of shorter pieces, essays and commentaries for various newspapers and magazines.[99]\n\n\nNotable among those during World War II was \"An Open Letter to Frenchmen Everywhere\", which was highly controversial in its attempt to rally support for France against Nazi oppression at a time when the French were sharply divided between support of the Gaullists and Vichy factions. It was published in *The New York Times Magazine* in November 1942, in its original French in *Le Canada, de Montréal* at the same time, and in *Pour la Victoire* the following month.[100][91] Other shorter pieces include (in French except where translated by others to English):[96][100]\n\n\n\n* \"Une Lettre de M. de Saint-Exupéry\", *Les Annales politiques et littéraires*, 15 December 1931; (extracts from a letter written to Benjamin Crémieux).\n* Preface of *Destin de Le Brix* by José le Boucher, Nouvelle Librairie Française, 1932.\n* Preface of *Grandeur et servitude de l'aviation* by Maurice Bourdet, Paris: Editions Corrêa, 1933.\n* \"Reflections on War\", translated from *Paris-Soir* and published in *Living Age*, November 1938, pp. 225–228.\n* Preface of *Vent se lève* (French translation of *Listen! The Wind*) by Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Paris: Editions Corrêa, 1939.[Note 19]\n* Preface of *Pilotes d'essai* by Jean-Marie Conty, Paris: Edition Spes, 1939.\n* \"Books I Remember\", *Harper's Bazaar*, April 1941.\n* \"Letter to Young Americans\", *The American High School Weekly*, 25 May 1942, pp. 17–18.\n* \"Voulez-vous, Français, vous reconcilier?\", *Le Canada, de Montreal*, 30 November 1942.\n* \"L'Homme et les éléments\", *Confluences*, 1947, Vol. VII, pp. 12–14 (issue dedicated to Saint-Exupéry; originally published in English in 1939 as 'The Elements' in *Wind, Sand and Stars*).\n* \"Lettre Inédite au General C\", *Le Figaro Littéraire*, 10 April 1948 (posthumous).\n* \"Seigneur Berbère\", *La Table Ronde*, No. 7, July 1948 (posthumous).\n\n\n### Censorship and publication bans[edit]\n\n\n*Pilote de guerre* (*Flight To Arras*), which describes the German invasion of France, was slightly censored when it was released in its original French during wartime by Éditions Gallimard in his homeland in 1942, due to the removal of a derogatory remark which was made about Hitler (which Gallimard failed to reinsert in subsequent editions after World War II). Shortly after the book's wartime release in France, Nazi appeasers and Vichy supporters objected to its praise of one of Saint-Exupéry's squadron colleagues, Captain Jean Israël, who was portrayed as being amongst the squadron's bravest defenders during the Battle of France.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn support of their German occupiers and masters, Vichy authorities attacked the author as a defender of Jews (in racist terms) leading to the praised book being banned in France,[*dubious – discuss*] along with prohibitions against further printings of Saint-Exupéry's other works.[47] Prior to France's liberation new printings of Saint-Exupéry's works were made available there only by means of covert print runs, such as that of February 1943 when 1,000 copies of an underground version of *Pilote de guerre* were printed in Lyon. [47][46][101]\n\n\nA further complication occurred due to Saint-Exupéry's and others' view of General Charles de Gaulle, who was held in low regard. Early in the war, de Gaulle became the leader of the Free French Forces in exile, with his headquarters in London. Even though both men were working to free France from Nazi occupation, Saint-Exupéry viewed de Gaulle with apprehension as a possible post-war dictator, and he consequently provided no public support to the General. De Gaulle retaliated by implying that the author was a supporter of Germany, and he then had his literary works banned in France's North African colonies. Saint-Exupéry's writings were, with irony, banned simultaneously in occupied France and the territory which was controlled by Free France.[24][102]\n\n\n\n### Extension of copyrights in France[edit]\n\n\nDue to Saint-Exupéry's wartime death, the French government awarded his estate the civil code designation *Mort pour la France* (English: *Died for France*) in 1948. Amongst the law's provisions is an increase of 30 years to the duration of the original copyright's duration of 70 years; thus most of Saint-Exupéry's creative works will not fall out of copyright status in France for an extra 30 years.[103][104]\n\n\n\n## Honours and legacy[edit]\n\n\n* Images of remembrance\n* ![Commemorative inscription in the Panthéon of Paris.](image)\n\nCommemorative inscription in the Panthéon of Paris.\n* ![Portrait and images from The Little Prince on a 50-franc banknote](image)\n\nPortrait and images from *The Little Prince* on a 50-franc banknote\n* ![Historical marker where the Saint-Exupérys resided in Quebec.](image)\n\nHistorical marker where the Saint-Exupérys resided in Quebec.\n\n\n* Saint-Exupéry is commemorated with an inscription in the Panthéon in Paris, France's repository of historical greats. Although his body was never identified, his name was added to the Panthéon in November 1967 by a French legislative act. The inscription reads: \"*A LA MÉMOIRE DE • ANTOINE DE SAINT EXUPERY • POÈTE ROMANCIER AVIATEUR • DISPARU AU COURS D'UNE MISSION • DE RECONNAISSANCE AÉRIENNE • LE 31 JUILLET 1944*\" (To the memory of Antoine de Saint Exupery, poet, novelist, aviator, missing during an aerial reconnaissance mission, 31 July 1944). Amongst other honours from France, he was named a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in April 1930 and was promoted to an Officier de la Légion d'honneur in January 1939. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1940 and was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre avec Palme in 1944.[*citation needed*]\n* From 1993 until the introduction of the euro, Saint-Exupéry's portrait and several of his drawings from *The Little Prince* appeared on France's 50-franc banknote.[24] The French Government also later minted a 100-franc commemorative coin, with Saint-Exupéry on its obverse side, and the Little Prince on its reverse. Brass-plated souvenir *Monnaie de Paris* commemorative medallions were also created in his honour, depicting the pilot's portrait over the P-38 Lightning aircraft he last flew.\n* In 1999, the Government of Quebec and Quebec City added a historical marker to the family home of Charles De Koninck, head of the Department of Philosophy at Université Laval, where the Saint-Exupérys stayed while lecturing in Canada for several weeks during May and June 1942.[*citation needed*]\n* In 2000, on the centenary of his birth, in the city where he was born, he was memorialised when the Lyon Satolas Airport was renamed the Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport. Lyon's TGV bullet train station was also renamed as Gare de Lyon Saint-Exupéry. The author is additionally commemorated by a statue in Lyon, depicting a seated Saint-Exupéry with the little prince standing behind him.[*citation needed*]\n* A street in Montesson, a suburb of Paris, is named for him as Rue Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Museums and exhibits[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A portion of the **Saint-Exupéry exhibit**, in the French Air & Space Museum, Le Bourget, Paris.\n![](image)The facade of the **Antoine de Saint-Exupery Museum** in Tarfaya, Morocco.\n![](image)Lamplighter Square at **The Museum of The Little Prince**, Hakone, Japan.\nMuseum exhibits, exhibitions and theme villages dedicated to both him and his diminutive Little Prince have been created in Le Bourget, Paris and other locations in France, as well as in the Republic of South Korea, Japan, Morocco, Brazil, the United States and Canada:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* The Air and Space Museum at Paris's Le Bourget Airport, in cooperation with The Estate of Saint-Exupéry-d'Agay, has created a permanent exhibit of 300 m2 dedicated to the author, pilot, person and humanist. The *Espace Saint Exupéry* exhibit, officially inaugurated in 2006 on the anniversary of the aviator's birthday,[105] traces each stage of his life as an airmail pioneer, eclectic intellectual artist, and military pilot. It includes artifacts from his life: photographs, his drawings, letters, some of his original notebooks (*carnets*) he scribbled in voluminously and which were later published posthumously, plus remnants of the unarmed P-38 he flew on his last reconnaissance mission and which were recovered from the Mediterranean Sea.[106]\n* In Tarfaya, Morocco, next to the Cape Juby airfield where Saint-Exupéry was based as an Aéropostale airmail pilot/station manager, Antoine de Saint-Exupery Museum was created honouring both him and the company. A small monument at the airfield is also dedicated to them.[*citation needed*]\n* In Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, and Hakone, Japan, theme village museums have been created honouring Saint-Exupéry's *Little Prince*.\n* In January 1995, the Alberta Aviation Museum of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in conjunction with the cultural organization Alliance française, presented a showing of Saint-Exupéry letters, watercolours, sketches and photographs.[107]\n* In São Paulo, Brazil, through 2009, the Oca Art Exhibition Centre presented Saint-Exupéry and The Little Prince as part of The Year of France and The Little Prince. The displays covered over 10,000 m2 on four floors, and chronicled Saint-Exupéry, *The Little Prince* and their philosophies, as visitors passed through theme areas of the desert, asteroids, stars, and the cosmos. The ground floor of the giant exhibition was laid out as a huge map of the routes flown by the author with Aeropostale in South America and around the world. Also included was a full-scale replica of the author's crashed Caudron Simoun, lying wrecked on the ground of a simulated Libyan desert following his disastrous Paris-Saigon race attempt. The miraculous survival of Saint-Exupéry and his mechanic/navigator was subsequently chronicled in the award-winning memoir *Wind, Sand and Stars* (*Terre des hommes*), and also formed the introduction of his most famous work *The Little Prince* (*Le Petit Prince*).[108]\n* In 2011, the City of Toulouse, France, home of Airbus and the pioneering airmail carrier Aéropostale, in conjunction with the Estate of Saint-Exupéry-d'Agay and the Youth Foundation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, hosted a major exposition on Saint-Exupéry and his experience with Aéropostale. The exposition, titled *L'année Antoine de Saint-Exupéry à Toulouse*, exhibited selected personal artifacts of the author-aviator, including gloves, photos, posters, maps, manuscripts, drawings, models of the aircraft he flew, some of the wreckage from his Sahara Desert plane crash, and the personal silver identification bracelet engraved with his and Consuelo's name, presented by his U.S. publisher, which was recovered from his last, ultimate crash site in the Mediterranean Sea.[109]\n* On 27 February 2012, Russia's Ulyanovsk State University inaugurated its new International Saint-Exupéry Centre, led by its Director, Elena Mironova, an associate professor of French. The center will serve as a permanent museum dedicated to the author-aviator, as well as a cultural and linguistics center for the university. The museum was established with the assistance of Civil Aviation College teacher Nikolai Yatsenko, an author of 12 publications on Saint-Exupéry who personally donated some 6,000 related items. Located in Ulyanovsk, the university's new center will also help support the study of international languages in a city which promotes itself as a major aerospace and cultural centre. The centre's opening was attended by Ulyanovsk Governor Sergey Morozov, Sergey Krasnov of the Ulyanovsk Civil Aviation College and other aerospace and academic dignitaries, as well as Veronique Jober, Sorbonne professor of Slavic languages, who addressed the audience by video link from Paris.[110]\n* A number of other prominent exhibitions were created in France and the United States, many of them in 2000, honouring the centenary of the author-aviator's birth.\n* In January 2014, New York City's Morgan Library & Museum featured a major three-month-long exhibition, *The Little Prince: A New York Story*. Celebrating the 70th anniversary year of the novella's publication, its exhibits included many of Saint-Exupéry's original manuscript pages, his story's preliminary drawings and watercolor paintings, and also examined Saint-Exupéry's creative writing processes.[111][112][113][114][115]\n\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n* Saint-Exupéry's 1939 memoir *Terre des hommes* (titled as *Wind, Sand and Stars* in English) was chosen to create the central theme (*Terre des Hommes–Man and His World*) of the 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal, Quebec, Canada (Expo '67), the most successful world's fair of the 20th century. The central theme, which also generated the 17 subsidiary elements used for the world's fair, was elucidated at a 1963 Montebello, Quebec, conference held with some of Canada's leading thinkers. At Montebello, French-Canadian author Gabrielle Roy helped choose the central theme by quoting Saint-Exupéry on mankind's place in the universe:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n> \"*Être homme, c'est précisément être responsable. C'est sentir, en posant sa pierre, que l'on contribue à bâtir le monde*\" (to be a man is to be responsible, to feel that by laying one's own stone, one contributes to building the world)\n> \n> \n\n\nAdditionally, Michèle Lalonde and André Prévost's oratorio *Terre des hommes*, performed at the *Place des Nations* opening ceremonies and attended by the international delegates of the participating countries, strongly projected the French writer's 'idealist rhetoric'. Consuelo de Saint Exupéry (1901–1979), his widow, was also a guest of honour at the opening ceremonies of the world's fair.[116]\n* Asteroid 2578 Saint-Exupéry, discovered in November 1975 by Russian astronomer Tamara Smirnova and provisionally cataloged as Asteroid 1975 VW3, was renamed in the author-aviator's honour.[117] Another asteroid was named as 46610 Bésixdouze (translated to and from both hexadecimal and French as 'B612').[118] Additionally the terrestrial-asteroid protection organization B612 Foundation was named in tribute to the author's *Little Prince*, who fell to Earth from Asteroid B-612.[119][120][121][122]\n* Philatelic tributes have been printed in at least 25 other countries as of 2011[update].[123] Only three years after his death, the pilot-aviator was first featured on an 8 franc French West Africa airmail stamp (Scott Catalog # C11). France followed several months later in 1948 with an 80 franc airmail stamp honouring him (CB1), and later with another stamp honouring both him and airmail pioneer Jean Mermoz, plus the supersonic Concorde passenger airliner, in 1970 (C43).[123] In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the writer's death, Israel issued a stamp honoring \"Saint-Ex\" and *The Little Prince* in 1994.[124]\n* In Argentina and Brazil, where Saint-Exupéry became the founding director of the pioneering South American airmail airline Aeroposta Argentina:\n\t+ the Aguja Saint Exupery is a mountain peak located near the Cerro Chaltén (also known as Monte Fitz Roy) in the Los Glaciares National Park in Patagonia, Argentina, The mountain peak is named in Saint-Exupéry's honour;[*citation needed*]\n\t+ the San Antonio Oeste municipal airport was named Aerodromo Saint Exupery.[125] A small museum exhibit resides in the airport building;\n\t+ the small Brazilian airport serving Ocauçu, São Paulo is named after the pilot, and[*citation needed*]\n\t+ several Argentinian schools are also named after the author-aviator.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe main street of the town of Campeche on the Ilha da Santa Catarina (where florianopolis the capital the state is also situated), is named avenida principe pequeno because of his connection to the region.\n\n\n\n### Institutions and schools[edit]\n\n\n* In 1960 the humanitarian organization *Terre des hommes*, named after Saint-Exupéry's 1939 philosophical memoir *Terre des hommes* (titled as *Wind, Sand and Stars* in English),[126] was founded in Lausanne, Switzerland by Edmond Kaiser. Other *Terre des Hommes* societies were later organized in more countries with similar social aid and humanitarian goals. The several independent groups joined to form a new umbrella organization, *Terre des Hommes-Fédération Internationale* (TDHFI, in English: International Federation of Terre des Hommes, or IFTDH). The national constituents first met in 1966 to formalize their new parent organization, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. As of 2009[update] eleven organizations in Canada, Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and Syria belonged to the Federation. An important part of their works is their consulting role to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).[127]\n* In June 2009, the Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Youth Foundation (FASEJ) was founded in Paris by the Saint-Exupéry–d'Agay Estate, to promote education, art, culture, health and sports for youth worldwide, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This organization, which follows Saint-Exupéry's philosophies and his memory, was financed in part by the sale of one of his original 1936 handwritten manuscripts at a Sotheby's auction for €312,750.[128][129]\n* Numerous public schools, lycées, high schools, colleges and technical schools have been named in honour of Saint-Exupéry across France, Europe, Québec and South America, as well as at least two in Africa. The *École Antoine de Saint-Exupéry de Kigali*, a French international school in Rwanda, is named after him, as is École Francaise Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in Saint Louis, Senegal[130][131]\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nNumerous other tributes have been awarded to honour Saint-Exupéry and his most famous literary creation, his *Little Prince*:\n\n\n\n* The *GR I/33* (later renamed as the 1/33 Belfort Squadron), one of the French Air Force squadrons Saint-Exupéry flew with, adopted the image of the *Little Prince* as part of the squadron and tail insignia on its Dassault Mirage fighter jets.[132]\n* Google celebrated Saint-Exupéry's 110th birthday with a special logotype depicting the little prince being hoisted through the heavens by a flock of birds.[133]\n* Numerous streets and place names are named after the author-aviator throughout France and other countries.[*citation needed*]\n* Cafe Saint-Ex, a popular bar and nightclub in Washington, D.C. near the U-Street corridor, holds Saint-Exupéry as its name source.[*citation needed*]\n* Uruguayan airline BQB Líneas Aéreas named one of its aircraft, an ATR-72 (CX-JPL), in honor of the aviator.[*citation needed*]\n* International Watch Company (IWC) has created many St Exupery tribute versions of several of their wristwatch lines, with the distinctive 'A' from his signature featured on the dial.[*citation needed*]\n* The American aviation magazine *Flying* ranked Saint-Exupéry number 41 on their list of the \"51 Heroes of Aviation\".[134]\n* The French 50 Franc banknote depicted Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and had several features that allude to his works.[135]\n* The new flagship of CMA CGM Group for celebrating her 40th Anniversary, takes the name of **Antoine de Saint-Exupéry** to commemorate his achievement.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n* *Wings of Courage* is a 1995 docudrama by French director Jean-Jacques Annaud. The movie was the world's first dramatic picture shot in the IMAX-format and is an account of the true story of early airmail pilots Henri Guillaumet (played by Craig Sheffer), Saint-Exupéry played by Tom Hulce, and several others.[*citation needed*]\n* Saint-Exupéry and his wife Consuelo were portrayed by Bruno Ganz and Miranda Richardson in the 1997 biopic *Saint-Ex*, a British film biography of the French author-pilot. It also featured Eleanor Bron and was filmed and distributed in the United Kingdom, with scripting by Frank Cottrell Boyce. The film combines elements of biography, documentary, and dramatic licence.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\n* After his disappearance, Consuelo de Saint Exupéry wrote *The Tale of the Rose*, which was published in 2000 and subsequently translated into 16 languages.[136]\n* Saint-Exupéry is mentioned in Tom Wolfe's *The Right Stuff*: \"A saint in short, true to his name, flying up here at the right hand of God.

His father and mother were Viscount Jean de Saint Exupéry (1863–1904; different sources name his father as Jean-Marc or Caesar de Saint Exupéry[11]) and Visountess Marie, née Boyer de Fonscolombe (1875–1972). He was baptized in a Catholic ceremony in his great-aunt's chapel on 15 August 1900 in Saint-Maurice-de-Rémens; his godfather was his uncle, Roger de Saint Exupéry, Earl of Miremont (1865 – August 1914, killed leading his battalion in Maissin, Belgium, during the First World War), and his godmother was his aunt Madeleine Fonscolombe.[10]\n2. **^** \n\nHélène (Nelly) de Vogüé (1908–2003), born Hélène Jaunez to a French businessman, became a well known French business executive and also an intellectual fluent in several languages. She married the equally well known French noble, Jean de Vogüé, in 1927 and had one child with him, a son named Patrice. Hélène is referred to only as \"Madame de B.\" in multiple Saint-Exupéry biographies. This occurred due to agreements she made with writers before granting them access to her troves of the author-aviator's writings, which she deposited in the French national archives – from which they will not be released until 2053. It is believed she sought her anonymity to protect Saint-Exupéry's reputation, as during the Second World War, the U.S. OSS suspected she was a secret Vichy agent and Nazi collaborator.[23]\n3. **^** \n\nThe aircraft Saint-Exupéry was flying when he crashed in the Sahara was a Caudron C.630 Simoun, Serial Number 7042, with the French registration F-ANRY, with 'F' being the international designator for France, and the remainder being derived from 'ANtoine de saint-exupéRY'.\n4. **^** \n\nThe large home of Charles De Koninck has since been classified as a historical building and has been visited frequently by numerous worldwide personalities from academic, scientific, intellectual, and political circles. Thomas kept a few memories from Saint-Exupéry's visit: \"[He was] a great man. He was the aviator. Someone we would get attached to quite easily, who would show interest in us, the kids. He would make us paper planes, drawings. [...] He loved mathematical enigmas.\" The following year, he published *The Little Prince*. According to the local legend, Saint-Exupéry received his inspiration from the junior De Koninck, who asked many questions. However, Thomas De Koninck denied this interpretation: \"*The Little Prince* is Saint-Exupéry himself.\"\n5. **^** \n\nAlthough Saint-Exupéry's regular publisher in France, Gallimard, lists *Le Petit Prince* as being published in 1946, that apparently is a legalistic interpretation possibly designed to allow for an extra year of the novella's copyright protection period and is based on Gallimard's explanation that sales of the book started only in 1946. Other sources, such as the one referenced, depict the first Librairie Gallimard printing of 12,250 copies as occurring on 30 November 1945.[48]\n6. **^** \n\nAfter being grounded following his crash, Saint-Exupéry spared no efforts in his campaign to return to active combat flying duty. He utilized all his contacts and powers of persuasion to overcome his age and physical handicap barriers, which would have completely barred an ordinary patriot from serving as a war pilot. Instrumental in his reinstatement was an agreement he proposed to John Phillips, a fluently bilingual *Life Magazine* correspondent in February 1944, where Saint-Exupéry committed to \"...write, and I'll donate what I do to you, for your publication, if you get me reinstated into my squadron.\"[52] Phillips later met with a high level U.S. Army Air Forces press officer in Italy, Colonel John Reagan McCrary, who conveyed the *Life Magazine* request to General Eaker. The approval for return to flying status would be made \"...not through favoritism, but through exception\". The brutalized French, it was noted, would cut a German's throat \"...probably with more relish than anybody\".\n7. **^** Saint-Exupéry suffered recurring pain and immobility from previous injuries due to his five serious aircraft crashes. After his death, they were also vague suggestions that his disappearance was the result of suicide rather than aircraft failure or combat loss.\n8. **^** Various sources state that his final flight was either his seventh, eight, ninth, and even his 10th mission. He volunteered for almost every proposed mission submitted to his squadron, and protested fiercely after being grounded following his second sortie, which ended with a demolished P-38. Saint-Exupéry's friends, colleagues and compatriots were working to keep him grounded and out of harm's way, but his connections in high places, plus a publishing agreement with *Life Magazine*, were instrumental in having the grounding lifted.[57]\n9. **^** One ruse contemplated by GR II/33's commanders was to expose Saint-Exupéry \"accidentally\" to the plans of the pending invasion of France so he could be subsequently grounded. No air force general would countermand such a grounding order and risk Saint-Exupéry's being captured by the Germans if he were forced down. Saint-Exupéry's commanding officer – a close friend of his – was ill and absent when the author took off on his final flight. The commander \"bawled out\" his staff when he learned that a grounding scheme had not been implemented.\n10. **^** \n\nSaint-Exupéry's P-38, as identified in the wreckage recovery report, was an F-5B-1-LO, LAC 2734 variant, serial number 42-68223, which departed Borgo-Porreta, Bastia, Corsica, France on 31 July 1944, at 8:45a.m. The report includes an image of a component bearing a serial number which confirmed it came from Saint-Exupéry's aircraft. The size of the debris field – 1 km (0.62 mi) long and 400 m (1,300 ft) wide – suggested that the aircraft had struck the water at high velocity.[63]\n11. **^** The Luftwaffe pilot was on patrol near Corsica, and could have intercepted Lt. Meredith.[69] Lt. Meredith's remains were not recovered. He is listed on the Tablets of the Missing at the Florence, Italy ABMC Cemetery {ABMC Records}. Lt. Meredith was shot down by *Feldwebel* Guth of 3./*Jagdgruppe* 200, the same unit in which Horst Rippert (see below) was serving. Guth's victory claim is recorded in the lists which are held by the German *Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv* . The progress of the interception was followed by Allied radar and radio monitoring stations and documented in Missing Air Crew Report 7339 on the loss of Second Lieutenant Gene C. Meredith of the 23rd Photographic Squadron/5th Reconnaissance Group. The intercepted Mediterranean Allied Air Forces Signals Intelligence Report for 30 July records that \"an Allied reconnaissance aircraft was claimed shot down at 1115 [GMT]\". The last estimated position of Meredith's plane is 4307N, 0756E.[70]\n12. **^** He is buried in the German military cemetery at Dagneux, France.\n13. **^** The RAF's No. 276 Wing (Signals Intelligence, Allied intercepts of Luftwaffe communications) Operations Record Book for 31 July 1944 notes only: \"... three enemy fighter sections between 0758/0929 hours operating in reaction to Allied fighters over Cannes, Toulon and the area to the North. No contacts. Patrol activity north of Toulon reported between 1410/1425 hours\".[69]\n14. **^** In documents OIS 4FG 40 and OP rep 25 (available at SHD / Air), the 4th Fighter Squadron on a sweeping mission from Vercors to Orange, observed two German \"bogeys\" flying East at 11:30a.m. Given Saint-Exupéry's fuel reserves and expected mission duration, it is possible that he crossed paths with the German aircraft.[79]\n15. **^** The proposed \"suppression\" of Rippert's claim due to Saint-Exupéry's stature was also met with skepticism as Luftwaffe pilots tended to immediately report their kills, and the Allies did not broadcast Saint-Exupéry's status as missing for at least two days.[69] It is feasible that Rippert did not push for an official kill, given that he was flying alone with no spotter to corroborate.[79] After the war, Horst Rippert became a television journalist and led the ZDF sports department. He was the brother of German singer Ivan Rebroff. Rippert died in 2013.\n16. **^** Of further note, as described in the history of the 33rd Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, a P-38 triggered anti-aircraft fire near Istres on 31 July, a reminder that there are many possible direct or indirect causes of Saint-Exupéry's death.[87][79]\n17. **^** The French and English versions of this book (*Terre des hommes*/*Wind, Sand and Stars*) differed significantly, with Saint-Exupéry removing sections from the original French version he did not consider appropriate for its targeted U.S. audience, and adding new material specifically written for that group and translated into English, which he could not speak. Although it did not appear in its earliest editions of the English translation, *An Appreciation* was added to later printings, contributed by Anne Morrow Lindbergh, and earlier published in *The Saturday Review of Literature* on 14 October 1939.[91]\n18. **^** The last paragraph of *Flying*'s book review of *A Sense of Life* incorrectly states that Saint-Exupéry's last mission was a bombing run, when in fact it was a photo-reconnaissance assignment for the pending invasion of Southern France.\n19. **^** In exchange, Lindbergh contributed \"An Appreciation\" to the later printings of Saint-Exupéry's *Wind, Sand and Stars*, earlier published in *The Saturday Review of Literature* on 14 October 1939.[91]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Commire (1980), p. 158.\n2. **^** Commire (1980), p. 161.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Schiff (2006), p. xi.\n4. **^** \"Saint-Exupéry, Antoine de\". *Lexico UK English Dictionary*.

She also wrote the world's longest-running play, the murder mystery *The Mousetrap*, which has been performed in the West End since 1952. A writer during the \"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\", Christie has been called the \"Queen of Crime\". She also wrote six novels under the pseudonym **Mary Westmacott**. In 1971, she was made a Dame (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to literature. *Guinness World Records* lists Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time, her novels having sold more than two billion copies.\n\n\nChristie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon, and was largely home-schooled. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed in 1920 when *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, featuring detective Hercule Poirot, was published. Her first husband was Archibald Christie; they married in 1914 and had one child before divorcing in 1928. Following the breakdown of her marriage and the death of her mother in 1926 she made international headlines by going missing for eleven days. During both World Wars, she served in hospital dispensaries, acquiring a thorough knowledge of the poisons that featured in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. Following her marriage to archaeologist Max Mallowan in 1930, she spent several months each year on digs in the Middle East and used her first-hand knowledge of this profession in her fiction.\n\n\nAccording to UNESCO's Index Translationum, she remains the most-translated individual author.[1] Her novel *And Then There Were None* is one of the top-selling books of all time, with approximately 100 million copies sold. Christie's stage play *The Mousetrap* holds the world record for the longest initial run. It opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End on 25 November 1952, and by 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances. The play was temporarily closed in 2020 because of COVID-19 lockdowns in London before it reopened in 2021.\n\n\nIn 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's Grand Master Award. Later that year, *Witness for the Prosecution* received an Edgar Award for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the Crime Writers' Association. In 2015, *And Then There Were None* was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate.[2] Many of Christie's books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and graphic novels. More than 30 feature films are based on her work.\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and adolescence: 1890–1907[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Christie entitled *Lost in Reverie*, by Douglas John Connah, 1894\nAgatha Mary Clarissa Miller was born on 15 September 1890, into a wealthy upper middle class family in Torquay, Devon. She was the youngest of three children born to Frederick Alvah Miller, \"a gentleman of substance\",[3] and his wife Clarissa Margaret \"Clara\" Miller, née Boehmer.[4]: 1–4[5][6][7]\n\n\nChristie's mother Clara was born in Dublin in 1854[a] to British Army officer Frederick Boehmer[10] and his wife Mary Ann Boehmer (née West). Boehmer died in Jersey in 1863,[b] leaving his widow to raise Clara and her brothers on a meagre income.[11][14]: 10 Two weeks after Boehmer's death, Mary's sister Margaret West married widowed dry goods merchant Nathaniel Frary Miller, a US citizen.[15] To assist Mary financially, they agreed to foster nine-year-old Clara; the family settled in Timperley, Cheshire.[16] Margaret and Nathaniel had no children together, but Nathaniel had a 17-year-old son, Fred Miller, from his previous marriage. Fred was born in New York City and travelled extensively after leaving his Swiss boarding school.[14]: 12 He and Clara were married in London in 1878.[4]: 2–5[5] Their first child, Margaret Frary (\"Madge\"), was born in Torquay in 1879.[4]: 6[17] The second, Louis Montant (\"Monty\"), was born in Morristown, New Jersey, in 1880,[18] while the family was on an extended visit to the United States.[12]: 7\n\n\nWhen Fred's father died in 1869,[19] he left Clara £2,000 (approximately equivalent to £230,000 in 2023); in 1881 they used this to buy the leasehold of a villa in Torquay named Ashfield.[20][21] It was here that their third and last child, Agatha, was born in 1890.[4]: 6–7[7] She described her childhood as \"very happy\".[12]: 3 The Millers lived mainly in Devon but often visited her step-grandmother/great-aunt Margaret Miller in Ealing and maternal grandmother Mary Boehmer in Bayswater.[12]: 26–31 A year was spent abroad with her family, in the French Pyrenees, Paris, Dinard, and Guernsey.[4]: 15, 24–25 Because her siblings were so much older, and there were few children in their neighbourhood, Christie spent much of her time playing alone with her pets and imaginary companions.[12]: 9–10, 86–88 She eventually made friends with other girls in Torquay, noting that \"one of the highlights of my existence\" was her appearance with them in a youth production of Gilbert and Sullivan's *The Yeomen of the Guard*, in which she played the hero, Colonel Fairfax.[4]: 23–27\n\n\n\n![Black-and-white portrait photograph of Christie as a girl](image)Christie as a girl, early 1900s\nAccording to Christie, Clara believed she should not learn to read until she was eight; thanks to her curiosity, she was reading by the age of four.[12]: 13 Her sister had been sent to a boarding school, but their mother insisted that Christie receive her education at home. As a result, her parents and sister supervised her studies in reading, writing and basic arithmetic, a subject she particularly enjoyed. They also taught her music, and she learned to play the piano and the mandolin.[4]: 8, 20–21\n\n\nChristie was a voracious reader from an early age. Among her earliest memories were of reading children's books by Mrs Molesworth and Edith Nesbit. When a little older, she moved on to the surreal verse of Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll.[4]: 18–19 As an adolescent, she enjoyed works by Anthony Hope, Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, and Alexandre Dumas.[12]: 111, 136–37 In April 1901, aged 10, she wrote her first poem, \"The Cow Slip\".[22]\n\n\nBy 1901, her father's health had deteriorated, because of what he believed were heart problems.[14]: 33 Fred died in November 1901 from pneumonia and chronic kidney disease.[23] Christie later said that her father's death when she was 11 marked the end of her childhood.[4]: 32–33\n\n\nThe family's financial situation had, by this time, worsened. Madge married the year after their father's death and moved to Cheadle, Cheshire; Monty was overseas, serving in a British regiment.[14]: 43, 49 Christie now lived alone at Ashfield with her mother. In 1902, she began attending Miss Guyer's Girls' School in Torquay but found it difficult to adjust to the disciplined atmosphere.[12]: 139 In 1905, her mother sent her to Paris, where she was educated in a series of *pensionnats* (boarding schools), focusing on voice training and piano playing. Deciding she lacked the temperament and talent, she gave up her goal of performing professionally as a concert pianist or an opera singer.[14]: 59–61\n\n\n\n### Early literary attempts, marriage, literary success: 1907–1926[edit]\n\n\nAfter completing her education, Christie returned to England to find her mother ailing. They decided to spend the northern winter of 1907–1908 in the warm climate of Egypt, which was then a regular tourist destination for wealthy Britons.[12]: 155–57 They stayed for three months at the Gezirah Palace Hotel in Cairo. Christie attended many dances and other social functions; she particularly enjoyed watching amateur polo matches. While they visited some ancient Egyptian monuments such as the Great Pyramid of Giza, she did not exhibit the great interest in archaeology and Egyptology that developed in her later years.[4]: 40–41 Returning to Britain, she continued her social activities, writing and performing in amateur theatrics. She also helped put on a play called *The Blue Beard of Unhappiness* with female friends.[4]: 45–47\n\n\nAt 18, Christie wrote her first short story, \"The House of Beauty\", while recovering in bed from an illness. It consisted of about 6,000 words about \"madness and dreams\", subjects of fascination for her. Her biographer Janet Morgan has commented that, despite \"infelicities of style\", the story was \"compelling\".[4]: 48–49 (The story became an early version of her story \"The House of Dreams\".)[24] Other stories followed, most of them illustrating her interest in spiritualism and the paranormal. These included \"The Call of Wings\" and \"The Little Lonely God\". Magazines rejected all her early submissions, made under pseudonyms (including Mac Miller, Nathaniel Miller, and Sydney West); some submissions were later revised and published under her real name, often with new titles.[4]: 49–50\n\n\n\n![](image)Christie as a young woman, 1910s\nAround the same time, Christie began work on her first novel, *Snow Upon the Desert*. Writing under the pseudonym Monosyllaba, she set the book in Cairo and drew upon her recent experiences there. She was disappointed when the six publishers she contacted declined the work.[4]: 50–51[25] Clara suggested that her daughter ask for advice from the successful novelist Eden Phillpotts, a family friend and neighbour, who responded to her enquiry, encouraged her writing, and sent her an introduction to his own literary agent, Hughes Massie, who also rejected *Snow Upon the Desert* but suggested a second novel.[4]: 51–52\n\n\nMeanwhile, Christie's social activities expanded, with country house parties, riding, hunting, dances, and roller skating.[12]: 165–66 She had short-lived relationships with four men and an engagement to another.[14]: 64–67 In October 1912, she was introduced to Archibald \"Archie\" Christie at a dance given by Lord and Lady Clifford at Ugbrooke, about 12 miles (19 km) from Torquay. The son of a barrister in the Indian Civil Service, Archie was a Royal Artillery officer who was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps in April 1913.[26] The couple quickly fell in love. Three months after their first meeting, Archie proposed marriage, and Agatha accepted.[4]: 54–63\n\n\n\n![](image)Christie as a nurse in the Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross. She is pictured in 1915 outside her childhood home of Ashfield.\nWith the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Archie was sent to France to fight. They married on Christmas Eve 1914 at Emmanuel Church, Clifton, Bristol, close to the home of his mother and stepfather, when Archie was on home leave.[27][28] Rising through the ranks, he was posted back to Britain in September 1918 as a colonel in the Air Ministry. Christie involved herself in the war effort as a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross. From October 1914 to May 1915, then from June 1916 to September 1918, she worked 3,400 hours in the Town Hall Red Cross Hospital, Torquay, first as a nurse (unpaid) then as a dispenser at £16 (approximately equivalent to £1,130 in 2023) a year from 1917 after qualifying as an apothecary's assistant.[4]: 69[29] Her war service ended in September 1918 when Archie was reassigned to London, and they rented a flat in St. John's Wood.[4]: 73–74\n\n\nChristie had long been a fan of detective novels, having enjoyed Wilkie Collins's *The Woman in White* and *The Moonstone*, and Arthur Conan Doyle's early Sherlock Holmes stories. She wrote her first detective novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, in 1916. It featured Hercule Poirot, a former Belgian police officer with \"magnificent moustaches\" and a head \"exactly the shape of an egg\",[30]: 13 who had taken refuge in Britain after Germany invaded Belgium. Christie's inspiration for the character came from Belgian refugees living in Torquay, and the Belgian soldiers she helped to treat as a volunteer nurse during the First World War.[4]: 75–79[31]: 17–18 Her original manuscript was rejected by Hodder & Stoughton and Methuen. After keeping the submission for several months, John Lane at The Bodley Head offered to accept it, provided that Christie change how the solution was revealed. She did so, and signed a contract committing her next five books to The Bodley Head, which she later felt was exploitative.[4]: 79, 81–82 It was published in 1920.[22]\n\n\n\n![Black-and-white photograph of three men in suits and one woman seated in a room and looking at an open newspaper](image)Archie Christie, Major Belcher (tour leader), Mr. Bates (secretary) and Agatha Christie on the 1922 British Empire Expedition Tour\nChristie settled into married life, giving birth to her only child, Rosalind Margaret Clarissa (later Hicks), in August 1919 at Ashfield.[4]: 79[14]: 340, 349, 422 Archie left the Air Force at the end of the war and began working in the City financial sector on a relatively low salary. They still employed a maid.[4]: 80–81 Her second novel, *The Secret Adversary* (1922), featured a new detective couple Tommy and Tuppence, again published by The Bodley Head. It earned her £50 (approximately equivalent to £3,400 in 2023). A third novel, *Murder on the Links*, again featured Poirot, as did the short stories commissioned by Bruce Ingram, editor of *The Sketch* magazine, from 1923.[4]: 83 She now had no difficulty selling her work.[30]: 33\n\n\nIn 1922, the Christies joined an around-the-world promotional tour for the British Empire Exhibition, led by Major Ernest Belcher. Leaving their daughter with Agatha's mother and sister, in 10 months they travelled to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Canada.[4]: 86–103[32] They learned to surf prone in South Africa; then, in Waikiki, they were among the first Britons to surf standing up, and extended their time there by three months to practise.[33][34] She is remembered at the British Surfing Museum as having said about surfing, \"*Oh it was heaven! Nothing like rushing through the water at what seems to you a speed of about two hundred miles an hour. It is one of the most perfect physical pleasures I have known*.\"[35]\n\n\nWhen they returned to England, Archie resumed work in the city, and Christie continued to work hard at her writing. After living in a series of apartments in London, they bought a house in Sunningdale, Berkshire, which they renamed Styles after the mansion in Christie's first detective novel.[4]: 124–25[14]: 154–55\n\n\nChristie's mother, Clarissa Miller, died in April 1926. They had been exceptionally close, and the loss sent Christie into a deep depression.[14]: 168–72 In August 1926, reports appeared in the press that Christie had gone to a village near Biarritz to recuperate from a \"breakdown\" caused by \"overwork\".[36]\n\n\n\n### Disappearance: 1926[edit]\n\n\n![Newspaper article with portraits of Agatha and Archie Christie](image)*Daily Herald*, 15 December 1926, announcing that Christie had been found. Missing for 11 days, she was found at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in Harrogate, Yorkshire\nIn August 1926, Archie asked Agatha for a divorce. He had fallen in love with Nancy Neele, a friend of Major Belcher.[14]: 173–74 On 3 December 1926, the pair quarrelled after Archie announced his plan to spend the weekend with friends, unaccompanied by his wife. Late that evening, Christie disappeared from their home in Sunningdale. The following morning, her car, a Morris Cowley, was discovered at Newlands Corner in Surrey, parked above a chalk quarry with an expired driving licence and clothes inside.[37][38] It was feared that she might have drowned herself in the Silent Pool, a nearby beauty spot.[39]\n\n\nThe disappearance quickly became a news story. The press sought to satisfy their readers' \"hunger for sensation, disaster, and scandal\".[14]: 224 Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks pressured police, and a newspaper offered a £100 reward (equivalent to £7,500 in 2023). More than 1,000 police officers, 15,000 volunteers, and several aeroplanes searched the rural landscape. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gave a spirit medium one of Christie's gloves to find her.[c] Christie's disappearance made international headlines, including featuring on the front page of *The New York Times*.[41][42] Despite the extensive manhunt, she was not found for another 10 days.[40][43][44] On 14 December 1926, she was located at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in Harrogate, Yorkshire, 184 miles (296 km) north of her home in Sunningdale, registered as \"Mrs Tressa[d] Neele\" (the surname of her husband's lover) from \"Capetown [*sic*] S.A.\" (South Africa).[46] The next day, Christie left for her sister's residence at Abney Hall, Cheadle, where she was sequestered \"in guarded hall, gates locked, telephone cut off, and callers turned away\".[45][47][48][49]\n\n\nChristie's autobiography makes no reference to the disappearance.[12] Two doctors diagnosed her with \"an unquestionable genuine loss of memory\",[49][50] yet opinion remains divided over the reason for her disappearance. Some, including her biographer Morgan, believe she disappeared during a fugue state.[4]: 154–59[40][51] The author Jared Cade concluded that Christie planned the event to embarrass her husband but did not anticipate the resulting public melodrama.[52]: 121 Christie biographer Laura Thompson provides an alternative view that Christie disappeared during a nervous breakdown, conscious of her actions but not in emotional control of herself.[14]: 220–21 Public reaction at the time was largely negative, supposing a publicity stunt or an attempt to frame her husband for murder.[53][e]\n\n\n\n### Second marriage and later life: 1927–1976[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a hotel room with Christie memorabilia on the walls](image)Christie's room at the Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul, where the hotel claims she wrote her 1934 novel *Murder on the Orient Express*\nIn January 1927, Christie, looking \"very pale\", sailed with her daughter and secretary to Las Palmas, Canary Islands, to \"complete her convalescence\",[54] returning three months later.[55][f] Christie petitioned for divorce and was granted a decree nisi against her husband in April 1928, which was made absolute in October 1928. Archie married Nancy Neele a week later.[56] Christie retained custody of their daughter, Rosalind, and kept the Christie surname for her writing.[31]: 21[57]\n\n\nReflecting on the period in her autobiography, Christie wrote, \"So, after illness, came sorrow, despair and heartbreak. There is no need to dwell on it.\"[12]: 340\n\n\nIn 1928, Christie left England and took the (Simplon) Orient Express to Istanbul and then to Baghdad.[4]: 169–70 In Iraq, she became friends with archaeologist Leonard Woolley and his wife, who invited her to return to their dig in February 1930.[12]: 376–77 On that second trip, she met archaeologist Max Mallowan, 13 years her junior.[14]: 284 In a 1977 interview, Mallowan recounted his first meeting with Christie, when he took her and a group of tourists on a tour of his expedition site in Iraq.[58] Christie and Mallowan married in Edinburgh in September 1930.[14]: 295–96[59] Their marriage lasted until Christie's death in 1976.[14]: 413–14 She accompanied Mallowan on his archaeological expeditions, and her travels with him contributed background to several of her novels set in the Middle East.[58] Other novels (such as *Peril at End House*) were set in and around Torquay, where she was raised.[30]: 95 Christie drew on her experience of international train travel when writing her 1934 novel *Murder on the Orient Express*.[4]: 201 The Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul, the eastern terminus of the railway, claims the book was written there and maintains Christie's room as a memorial to the author.[60][g]\n\n\n\n![Colour photograph of the front of a three-storey house](image)Cresswell Place, Chelsea\nChristie and Mallowan first lived in Cresswell Place in Chelsea, and later in Sheffield Terrace, Holland Park, Kensington. Both properties are now marked by blue plaques. In 1934, they bought Winterbrook House in Winterbrook, a hamlet near Wallingford.[61] This was their main residence for the rest of their lives and the place where Christie did much of her writing.[14]: 365 This house also bears a blue plaque. Christie led a quiet life despite being known in Wallingford; from 1951 to 1976 she served as president of the local amateur dramatic society.[62]\n\n\nThe couple acquired the Greenway Estate in Devon as a summer residence in 1938;[14]: 310 it was given to the National Trust in 2000.[63] Christie frequently stayed at Abney Hall, Cheshire, which was owned by her brother-in-law, James Watts, and based at least two stories there: a short story, \"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding\", in the story collection of the same name and the novel *After the Funeral*.[12]: 126[14]: 43 One Christie compendium notes that \"Abney became Agatha's greatest inspiration for country-house life, with all its servants and grandeur being woven into her plots. The descriptions of the fictional Chimneys, Stonygates, and other houses in her stories are mostly Abney Hall in various forms.\"[64]\n\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a wall plaque stating Christie \"lived here 1934–1941\"](image)Blue plaque at 58 Sheffield Terrace, Holland Park, London\n![](image)Winterbrook House, Winterbrook, Oxfordshire. Her final home, Christie lived here with her husband from 1934 until her death in 1976.\nDuring World War II, Christie moved to London and lived in a flat at the Isokon in Hampstead, whilst working in the pharmacy at University College Hospital (UCH), London, where she updated her knowledge of poisons.[65] Her later novel *The Pale Horse* was based on a suggestion from Harold Davis, the chief pharmacist at UCH. In 1977, a thallium poisoning case was solved by British medical personnel who had read Christie's book and recognised the symptoms she described.[66][67]\n\n\nThe British intelligence agency MI5 investigated Christie after a character called Major Bletchley appeared in her 1941 thriller *N or M?*, which was about a hunt for a pair of deadly fifth columnists in wartime England.[68] MI5 was concerned that Christie had a spy in Britain's top-secret codebreaking centre, Bletchley Park. The agency's fears were allayed when Christie told her friend, the codebreaker Dilly Knox, \"I was stuck there on my way by train from Oxford to London and took revenge by giving the name to one of my least lovable characters.\"[68]\n\n\nChristie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1950.[31]: 23 In honour of her many literary works, Christie was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours.[69] She was co-president of the Detection Club from 1958 to her death in 1976.[30]: 93 In 1961, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature degree by the University of Exeter.[31]: 23 In the 1971 New Year Honours, she was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE),[70][71][72] three years after her husband had been knighted for his archaeological work.[73] After her husband's knighthood, Christie could also be styled Lady Mallowan.[30]: 343\n\n\nFrom 1971 to 1974, Christie's health began to fail, but she continued to write. Her last novel was *Postern of Fate* in 1973.[4]: 368–72[14]: 477 Textual analysis suggested that Christie may have begun to develop Alzheimer's disease or other dementia at about this time.[74][75]\n\n\n\n### Personal qualities[edit]\n\n\n![Black-and-white portrait photograph of Christie in later life](image)Christie at Schiphol Airport, 17 September 1964\nIn 1946, Christie said of herself: \"My chief dislikes are crowds, loud noises, gramophones and cinemas. I dislike the taste of alcohol and do not like smoking. I *do* like sun, sea, flowers, travelling, strange foods, sports, concerts, theatres, pianos, and doing embroidery.\"[76]\n\n\nChristie was a lifelong, \"quietly devout\"[4]: 183 member of the Church of England, attended church regularly, and kept her mother's copy of *The Imitation of Christ* by her bedside.[14]: 30, 290 After her divorce, she stopped taking the sacrament of communion.[14]: 263\n\n\nThe Agatha Christie Trust For Children was established in 1969,[77] and shortly after Christie's death a charitable memorial fund was set up to \"help two causes that she favoured: old people and young children\".[78]\n\n\nChristie's obituary in *The Times* notes that \"she never cared much for the cinema, or for wireless and television.\" Further,\n\n\n\n\n> Dame Agatha's private pleasures were gardening – she won local prizes for horticulture – and buying furniture for her various houses. She was a shy person: she disliked public appearances, but she was friendly and sharp-witted to meet. By inclination as well as breeding, she belonged to the English upper middle class. She wrote about, and for, people like herself. That was an essential part of her charm.[3]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Death and estate[edit]\n\n\n### Death and burial[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a sandstone headstone](image)Christie's gravestone at St Mary's Church, Cholsey, Oxfordshire\nChristie died peacefully on 12 January 1976 at age 85 from natural causes at her home at Winterbrook House.[79][80] Upon her death, two West End theatres – the St. Martin's, where *The Mousetrap* was playing, and the Savoy, which was home to a revival of *Murder at the Vicarage* – dimmed their outside lights in her honour.[30]: 373 She was buried in the nearby churchyard of St Mary's, Cholsey, in a plot she had chosen with her husband 10 years previously. The simple funeral service was attended by about 20 newspaper and TV reporters, some having travelled from as far away as South America. Thirty wreaths adorned Christie's grave, including one from the cast of her long-running play *The Mousetrap* and one sent \"on behalf of the multitude of grateful readers\" by the Ulverscroft Large Print Book Publishers.[81]\n\n\nMallowan, who remarried in 1977, died in 1978 and was buried next to Christie.[82]\n\n\n\n###  Estate and subsequent ownership of works[edit]\n\n\nChristie was unhappy about becoming \"an employed wage slave\",[14]: 428 and for tax reasons set up a private company in 1955, Agatha Christie Limited, to hold the rights to her works. In about 1959 she transferred her 278-acre home, Greenway Estate, to her daughter, Rosalind Hicks.[83][84] In 1968, when Christie was almost 80, she sold a 51% stake in Agatha Christie Limited (and the works it owned) to Booker Books (better known as Booker Author's Division), which by 1977 had increased its stake to 64%.[4]: 355[85] Agatha Christie Limited still owns the worldwide rights for more than 80 of Christie's novels and short stories, 19 plays, and nearly 40 TV films.[86]\n\n\nIn the late 1950s, Christie had reputedly been earning around £100,000 (approximately equivalent to £3,000,000 in 2023) per year. Christie sold an estimated 300 million books during her lifetime.[87] At the time of her death in 1976, \"she was the best-selling novelist in history.\"[88]\nOne estimate of her total earnings from more than a half-century of writing is $20 million (approximately $107.1 million in 2023).[89] As a result of her tax planning, her will left only £106,683[h] (approximately equivalent to £970,000 in 2023) net, which went mostly to her husband and daughter along with some smaller bequests.[79][91] Her remaining 36% share of Agatha Christie Limited was inherited by Hicks, who passionately preserved her mother's works, image, and legacy until her own death 28 years later.[83] The family's share of the company allowed them to appoint 50% of the board and the chairman, and retain a veto over new treatments, updated versions, and republications of her works.[83][92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Greenway in Devon, Christie's summer home from 1938. The estate was used as a setting for some of her plots, including *Dead Man's Folly*. The final episode of *Agatha Christie's Poirot* was also filmed here in 2013.[93]\nIn 2004, Hicks' obituary in *The Telegraph* noted that she had been \"determined to remain true to her mother's vision and to protect the integrity of her creations\" and disapproved of \"merchandising\" activities.[83] Upon her death on 28 October 2004, the Greenway Estate passed to her son Mathew Prichard. After his stepfather's death in 2005, Prichard donated Greenway and its contents to the National Trust.[83][94]\n\n\nChristie's family and family trusts, including great-grandson James Prichard, continue to own the 36% stake in Agatha Christie Limited,[86] and remain associated with the company. In 2020, James Prichard was the company's chairman.[95] Mathew Prichard also holds the copyright to some of his grandmother's later literary works including *The Mousetrap*.[14]: 427 Christie's work continues to be developed in a range of adaptations.[96]\n\n\nIn 1998, Booker sold its shares in Agatha Christie Limited (at the time earning £2,100,000, approximately equivalent to £4,700,000 in 2023 annual revenue) for £10,000,000 (approximately equivalent to £22,200,000 in 2023) to Chorion, whose portfolio of authors' works included the literary estates of Enid Blyton and Dennis Wheatley.[92] In February 2012, after a management buyout, Chorion began to sell off its literary assets.[86] This included the sale of Chorion's 64% stake in Agatha Christie Limited to Acorn Media UK.[97] In 2014, RLJ Entertainment Inc. (RLJE) acquired Acorn Media UK, renamed it Acorn Media Enterprises, and incorporated it as the RLJE UK development arm.[98]\n\n\nIn late February 2014, media reports stated that the BBC had acquired exclusive TV rights to Christie's works in the UK (previously associated with ITV) and made plans with Acorn's co-operation to air new productions for the 125th anniversary of Christie's birth in 2015.[99] As part of that deal, the BBC broadcast *Partners in Crime*[100] and *And Then There Were None*,[101] both in 2015.[102] Subsequent productions have included *The Witness for the Prosecution*[103] but plans to televise *Ordeal by Innocence* at Christmas 2017 were delayed because of controversy surrounding one of the cast members.[104] The three-part adaptation aired in April 2018.[105] A three-part adaptation of *The A.B.C. Murders* starring John Malkovich and Rupert Grint began filming in June 2018 and was first broadcast in December 2018.[106][107] A two-part adaptation of *The Pale Horse* was broadcast on BBC1 in February 2020.[108] *Death Comes as the End* will be the next BBC adaptation.[109]\n\n\nSince 2020, reissues of Christie's Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot novels by HarperCollins have removed \"passages containing descriptions, insults or references to ethnicity\".[110]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agatha Christie bibliography\n\n### Works of fiction[edit]\n\n\n#### Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple[edit]\n\n\n![Drawing of a gentleman in a dinner suit twirling his large moustache, illustrating the Christie story \"13 for Dinner\"](image)An early depiction of detective Hercule Poirot, from *The American Magazine*, March 1933\nChristie's first published book, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, was released in 1920 and introduced the detective Hercule Poirot, who appeared in 33 of her novels and more than 50 short stories.\n\n\nOver the years, Christie grew tired of Poirot, much as Doyle did with Sherlock Holmes.[4]: 230 By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt he was \"an egocentric creep\".[111] Thompson believes Christie's occasional antipathy to her creation is overstated, and points out that \"in later life she sought to protect him against misrepresentation as powerfully as if he were her own flesh and blood\".[14]: 282 Unlike Doyle, she resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular.[4]: 222 She married off Poirot's \"Watson\", Captain Arthur Hastings, in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.[12]: 268\n\n\nMiss Jane Marple was introduced in a series of short stories that began publication in December 1927 and were subsequently collected under the title *The Thirteen Problems*.[14]: 278 Marple was a genteel, elderly spinster who solved crimes using analogies to English village life.[30]: 47, 74–76 Christie said, \"Miss Marple was not in any way a picture of my grandmother; she was far more fussy and spinsterish than my grandmother ever was\", but her autobiography establishes a firm connection between the fictional character and Christie's step-grandmother Margaret Miller (\"Auntie-Grannie\")[i] and her \"Ealing cronies\".[12]: 422–23[112] Both Marple and Miller \"always expected the worst of everyone and everything, and were, with almost frightening accuracy, usually proved right\".[12]: 422 Marple appeared in 12 novels and 20 stories.\n\n\nDuring the Second World War, Christie wrote two novels, *Curtain* and *Sleeping Murder*, featuring Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, respectively. Both books were sealed in a bank vault, and she made over the copyrights by deed of gift to her daughter and her husband to provide each with a kind of insurance policy.[14]: 344[30]: 190 Christie had a heart attack and a serious fall in 1974, after which she was unable to write.[4]: 372 Her daughter authorised the publication of *Curtain* in 1975,[4]: 375 and *Sleeping Murder* was published posthumously in 1976.[30]: 376 These publications followed the success of the 1974 film version of *Murder on the Orient Express*.[12]: 497[113]\n\n\nShortly before the publication of *Curtain*, Poirot became the first fictional character to have an obituary in *The New York Times*, which was printed on page one on 6 August 1975.[114][115]\n\n\nChristie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple.[30]: 375 In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot – a professional sleuth – would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\"[112]\n\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family supported the release of a new Poirot story, *The Monogram Murders*, written by British author Sophie Hannah.[116] Hannah later published three more Poirot mysteries, *Closed Casket* in 2016, *The Mystery of Three Quarters* in 2018.,[117][118] and *The Killings at Kingfisher Hill* in 2020.\n\n\n\n#### Formula and plot devices[edit]\n\n\nChristie has been called the \"Duchess of Death\", the \"Mistress of Mystery\", and the \"Queen of Crime\".[31]: 15 Early in her career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new.\"[36] According to Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?' Then, slowly, she reveals how the impossible is not only possible but the only thing that could have happened.\"[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAbney Hall, Cheshire, the inspiration for Christie novel settings such as Chimneys and Stonygates\n![](image)\nChristie used inspiration from her stay at the Old Cataract Hotel on the banks of the River Nile in Aswan, Egypt for her 1937 novel *Death on the Nile*\n\nChristie developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the \"Golden Age\" of detective fiction.[119] Author Dilys Winn called Christie \"the doyenne of Coziness\", a sub-genre which \"featured a small village setting, a hero with faintly aristocratic family connections, a plethora of red herrings and a tendency to commit homicide with sterling silver letter openers and poisons imported from Paraguay\".[120] At the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of their deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party; but there are exceptions where it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as *And Then There Were None* and *Endless Night*).[121][122]\n\n\nChristie did not limit herself to quaint English villages – the action might take place on a small island (*And Then There Were None*), an aeroplane (*Death in the Clouds*), a train (*Murder on the Orient Express*), a steamship (*Death on the Nile*), a smart London flat (*Cards on the Table*), a resort in the West Indies (*A Caribbean Mystery*), or an archaeological dig (*Murder in Mesopotamia*) – but the circle of potential suspects is usually closed and intimate: family members, friends, servants, business associates, fellow travellers.[123]: 37 Stereotyped characters abound (the *femme fatale*, the stolid policeman, the devoted servant, the dull colonel), but these may be subverted to stymie the reader; impersonations and secret alliances are always possible.[123]: 58 There is always a motive – most often, money: \"There are very few killers in Christie who enjoy murder for its own sake.\"[14]: 379, 396\n\n\nProfessor of Pharmacology Michael C. Gerald noted that \"in over half her novels, one or more victims are poisoned, albeit not always to the full satisfaction of the perpetrator.\"[124]: viii Guns, knives, garrottes, tripwires, blunt instruments, and even a hatchet were also used, but \"Christie never resorted to elaborate mechanical or scientific means to explain her ingenuity,\"[125]: 57 according to John Curran, author and literary adviser to the Christie estate.[126] Many of her clues are mundane objects: a calendar, a coffee cup, wax flowers, a beer bottle, a fireplace used during a heat wave.[123]: 38\n\n\nAccording to crime writer P. D. James, Christie was prone to making the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Alert readers could sometimes identify the culprit by identifying the least likely suspect.[127] Christie mocked this insight in her foreword to *Cards on the Table*: \"Spot the person least likely to have committed the crime and in nine times out of ten your task is finished. Since I do not want my faithful readers to fling away this book in disgust, I prefer to warn them beforehand *that this is not that kind of book*.\"[128]: 135–36\n\n\nOn BBC Radio 4's *Desert Island Discs* in 2007, Brian Aldiss said Christie had told him she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to \"frame\" that person.[129] Based upon a study of her working notebooks, Curran describes how Christie would first create a cast of characters, choose a setting, and then produce a list of scenes in which specific clues would be revealed; the order of scenes would be revised as she developed her plot. Of necessity, the murderer had to be known to the author before the sequence could be finalised and she began to type or dictate the first draft of her novel.[123] Much of the work, particularly dialogue, was done in her head before she put it on paper.[12]: 241–45[128]: 33\n\n\nIn 2013, the 600 members of the Crime Writers' Association chose *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* as \"the best whodunit ... ever written\".[130] Author Julian Symons observed, \"In an obvious sense, the book fits within the conventions ... The setting is a village deep within the English countryside, Roger Ackroyd dies in his study; there is a butler who behaves suspiciously ... Every successful detective story in this period involved a deceit practised upon the reader, and here the trick is the highly original one of making the murderer the local doctor, who tells the story and acts as Poirot's Watson.\"[119]: 106–07 Critic Sutherland Scott stated, \"If Agatha Christie had made no other contribution to the literature of detective fiction she would still deserve our grateful thanks\" for writing this novel.[131]\n\n\nIn September 2015, to mark her 125th birthday, *And Then There Were None* was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate.[132] The novel is emblematic of both her use of formula and her willingness to discard it. \"*And Then There Were None* carries the 'closed society' type of murder mystery to extreme lengths,\" according to author Charles Osborne.[30]: 170 It begins with the classic set-up of potential victim(s) and killer(s) isolated from the outside world, but then violates conventions. There is no detective involved in the action, no interviews of suspects, no careful search for clues, and no suspects gathered together in the last chapter to be confronted with the solution. As Christie herself said, \"Ten people had to die without it becoming ridiculous or the murderer being obvious.\"[12]: 457 Critics agreed she had succeeded: \"The arrogant Mrs. Christie this time set herself a fearsome test of her own ingenuity ... the reviews, not surprisingly, were without exception wildly adulatory.\"[30]: 170–71\n\n\n\n#### Character stereotypes and racism[edit]\n\n\nFor information on Christie's book originally titled *Ten Little Niggers*, see And Then There Were None.\n\nChristie included stereotyped descriptions of characters in her work, especially before 1945 (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.[4]: 264–66 For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection *The Mysterious Mr Quin*. In 1947, the Anti-Defamation League in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie's American publishers, Dodd, Mead and Company, regarding perceived antisemitism in her works. Christie's British literary agent later wrote to her US representative, authorising American publishers to \"omit the word 'Jew' when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books.\"[14]: 386\n\n\nIn *The Hollow*, published in 1946, one of the characters is described by another as \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a corncrake ... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some \"foreign\" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (*Hallowe'en Party*) and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in *Three Act Tragedy*), but they are rarely the culprits.[133]\n\n\nIn 2023, the *Telegraph* reported that several Agatha Christie novels have been edited to remove potentially offensive language, including insults and references to ethnicity. Poirot and Miss Marple mysteries written between 1920 and 1976 have had passages reworked or removed in new editions published by HarperCollins, in order to strip them of language and descriptions that modern audiences find offensive, especially those involving the characters Christie’s protagonists encounter outside the UK. Sensitivity readers had made the edits, which were evident in digital versions of the new editions, including the entire Miss Marple run and selected Poirot novels set to be released or that have been released since 2020.[134]\n\n\n\n#### Other detectives[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, Christie also created amateur detectives Thomas (Tommy) Beresford and his wife, Prudence \"Tuppence\" *née* Cowley, who appear in four novels and one collection of short stories published between 1922 and 1974. Unlike her other sleuths, the Beresfords were only in their early twenties when introduced in *The Secret Adversary*, and were allowed to age alongside their creator.[30]: 19–20 She treated their stories with a lighter touch, giving them a \"dash and verve\" which was not universally admired by critics.[31]: 63 Their last adventure, *Postern of Fate*, was Christie's last novel.[14]: 477\n\n\nHarley Quin was \"easily the most unorthodox\" of Christie's fictional detectives.[31]: 70 Inspired by Christie's affection for the figures from the Harlequinade, the semi-supernatural Quin always works with an elderly, conventional man called Satterthwaite. The pair appear in 14 short stories, 12 of which were collected in 1930 as *The Mysterious Mr. Quin*.[30]: 78, 80[135] Mallowan described these tales as \"detection in a fanciful vein, touching on the fairy story, a natural product of Agatha's peculiar imagination\".[30]: 80 Satterthwaite also appears in a novel, *Three Act Tragedy*, and a short story, \"Dead Man's Mirror\", both of which feature Poirot.[30]: 81\n\n\nAnother of her lesser-known characters is Parker Pyne, a retired civil servant who assists unhappy people in an unconventional manner.[30]: 118–19 The 12 short stories which introduced him, *Parker Pyne Investigates* (1934), are best remembered for \"The Case of the Discontented Soldier\", which features Ariadne Oliver, \"an amusing and satirical self-portrait of Agatha Christie\". Over the ensuing decades, Oliver reappeared in seven novels. In most of them she assists Poirot.[30]: 120\n\n\n\n#### Plays[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*The Mousetrap*, the world's longest-running play, showing at the West End's St Martin's Theatre in 2011 with the sign signifying the 59th year of the production\n![](image)\nThe wooden counter in the foyer of St Martin's Theatre showing 22,461 performances of *The Mousetrap* (pictured in November 2006). Attendees often get their photo taken next to it.[136]\n\nIn 1928, Michael Morton adapted *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* for the stage under the name of *Alibi*.[4]: 177 The play enjoyed a respectable run, but Christie disliked the changes made to her work and, in future, preferred to write for the theatre herself. The first of her own stage works was *Black Coffee*, which received good reviews when it opened in the West End in late 1930.[137] She followed this up with adaptations of her detective novels: *And Then There Were None* in 1943, *Appointment with Death* in 1945, and *The Hollow* in 1951.[4]: 242, 251, 288\n\n\nIn the 1950s, \"the theatre ... engaged much of Agatha's attention.\"[138] She next adapted her short radio play into *The Mousetrap*, which premiered in the West End in 1952, produced by Peter Saunders and starring Richard Attenborough as the original Detective Sergeant Trotter.[136] Her expectations for the play were not high; she believed it would run no more than eight months.[12]: 500 *The Mousetrap* has long since made theatrical history as the world's longest-running play, staging its 27,500th performance in September 2018.[136][139][140][141] The play temporarily closed in March 2020, when all UK theatres shut due to the coronavirus pandemic,[142][143] before it re-opened on 17 May 2021.[144]\n\n\nIn 1953, she followed this with *Witness for the Prosecution*, whose Broadway production won the New York Drama Critics' Circle award for best foreign play of 1954 and earned Christie an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America.[4]: 300[125]: 262 *Spider's Web*, an original work written for actress Margaret Lockwood at her request, premiered in the West End in 1954 and was also a hit.[4]: 297, 300 Christie became the first female playwright to have three plays running simultaneously in London: *The Mousetrap*, *Witness for the Prosecution* and *Spider's Web*.[145] She said, \"Plays are much easier to *write* than books, because you can *see* them in your mind's eye, you are not hampered by all that description which clogs you so terribly in a book and stops you from getting on with what's happening.\"[12]: 459 In a letter to her daughter, Christie said being a playwright was \"a lot of fun!\"[14]: 474\n\n\n\n#### As Mary Westmacott[edit]\n\n\nChristie published six mainstream novels under the name Mary Westmacott, a pseudonym which gave her the freedom to explore \"her most private and precious imaginative garden\".[14]: 366–67[30]: 87–88 These books typically received better reviews than her detective and thriller fiction.[14]: 366 Of the first, *Giant's Bread* published in 1930, a reviewer for *The New York Times* wrote, \"... her book is far above the average of current fiction, in fact, comes well under the classification of a 'good book'. And it is only a satisfying novel that can claim that appellation.\"[146] It was publicized from the very beginning that \"Mary Westmacott\" was a pen name of a well-known author, although the identity behind the pen name was kept secret; the dust jacket of *Giant's Bread* mentions that the author had previously written \"under her real name...half a dozen books that have each passed the thirty thousand mark in sales.\" (In fact, though this was technically true, it disguised Christie's identity through understatement. By the publication of *Giant's Bread*, Christie had published 10 novels and two short story collections, all of which had sold considerably more than 30,000 copies.) After Christie's authorship of the first four Westmacott novels was revealed by a journalist in 1949, she wrote two more, the last in 1956.[14]: 366\n\n\nThe other Westmacott titles are: *Unfinished Portrait* (1934), *Absent in the Spring* (1944), *The Rose and the Yew Tree* (1948), *A Daughter's a Daughter* (1952), and *The Burden* (1956).\n\n\n\n### Non-fiction works[edit]\n\n\nChristie published a few non-fiction works. *Come, Tell Me How You Live*, about working on an archaeological dig, was drawn from her life with Mallowan. *The Grand Tour: Around the World with the Queen of Mystery* is a collection of correspondence from her 1922 Grand Tour of the British Empire, including South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. *Agatha Christie: An Autobiography* was published posthumously in 1977 and adjudged the Best Critical/Biographical Work at the 1978 Edgar Awards.[147]\n\n\n\n### Titles[edit]\n\n\nMany of Christie's works from 1940 onward have titles drawn from literature, with the original context of the title typically printed as an epigraph.[148]\n\n\nThe inspirations for some of Christie's titles include:\n\n\n\n* William Shakespeare's works: *Sad Cypress*, *By the Pricking of My Thumbs*, *There is a Tide ...*, *Absent in the Spring*, and *The Mousetrap*, for example. Osborne notes that \"Shakespeare is the writer most quoted in the works of Agatha Christie\";[30]: 164\n* The Bible: *Evil Under the Sun*, *The Burden*, and *The Pale Horse*;\n* Other works of literature: *The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side* (from Tennyson's \"The Lady of Shalott\"), *The Moving Finger* (from Edward FitzGerald's translation of the *Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám*), *The Rose and the Yew Tree* (from T. S. Eliot's *Four Quartets*), *Postern of Fate* (from James Elroy Flecker's \"Gates of Damascus\"), *Endless Night* (from William Blake's \"Auguries of Innocence\"), *N or M?* (from the *Book of Common Prayer*), and *Come, Tell Me How You Live* (from Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking-Glass*).\n\n\nChristie biographer Gillian Gill said, \"Christie's writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie's novels succeed.\"[128]: 208 Reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror, numerous Christie titles were drawn from well-known children's nursery rhymes: *And Then There Were None* (from \"Ten Little Niggers\", a rhyme also published as \"Ten Little Indians\", both of which were also used for the book's title in some printings),[149] *One, Two, Buckle My Shoe* (from \"One, Two, Buckle My Shoe\"), *Five Little Pigs* (from \"This Little Piggy\"), *Crooked House* (from \"There Was a Crooked Man\"), *A Pocket Full of Rye* (from \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\"), *Hickory Dickory Dock* (from \"Hickory Dickory Dock\"), and *Three Blind Mice* (from \"Three Blind Mice\").[128]: 207–08\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a large, book-shaped bronze memorial](image)Memorial to Christie in central London\nChristie is regularly referred to as the \"Queen of Crime\"—which is now trademarked by the Christie estate—or \"Queen of Mystery\", and is considered a master of suspense, plotting, and characterisation.[150][151][152][153] In 1955, she became the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's Grand Master Award.[147] She was named \"Best Writer of the Century\" and the Hercule Poirot series of books was named \"Best Series of the Century\" at the 2000 Bouchercon World Mystery Convention.[154] In 2013, she was voted \"best crime writer\" in a survey of 600 members of the Crime Writers' Association of professional novelists.[130] However, the writer Raymond Chandler criticised the artificiality of her books, as did writer Julian Symons.[155][119]: 100–30 The literary critic Edmund Wilson described her prose as banal and her characterisations as superficial.[156][j]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"With Christie ... we are dealing not so much with a literary figure as with a broad cultural phenomenon, like Barbie or the Beatles.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Joan Acocella writing in *The New Yorker*[159]\n\nIn 2011, Christie was named by the digital crime drama TV channel Alibi as the second most financially successful crime writer of all time in the United Kingdom, after James Bond author Ian Fleming, with total earnings around £100 million.[160] In 2012, Christie was among the people selected by the artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous work, the Beatles' *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* album cover, \"to celebrate the British cultural figures he most admires\".[161][162] On the record-breaking longevity of Christie's *The Mousetrap* which had marked its 60th anniversary in 2012, Stephen Moss in *The Guardian* wrote, \"the play and its author are the stars\".[136]\n\n\nIn 2015, marking the 125th anniversary of her birth date, 25 contemporary mystery writers and one publisher gave their views on Christie's works. Many of the authors had read Christie's novels first, before other mystery writers, in English or in their native language, influencing their own writing, and nearly all still viewed her as the \"Queen of Crime\" and creator of the plot twists used by mystery authors. Nearly all had one or more favourites among Christie's mysteries and found her books still good to read nearly 100 years after her first novel was published. Just one of the 25 authors held with Wilson's views.[163]\n\n\n\n### Book sales[edit]\n\n\nIn her prime, Christie was rarely out of the bestseller list.[164] She was the first crime writer to have 100,000 copies of 10 of her titles published by Penguin on the same day in 1948.[165][166] As of 2018[update], *Guinness World Records* listed Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time.[167] As of 2020[update], her novels had sold more than two billion copies in 44 languages.[167] Half the sales are of English-language editions, and half are translations.[168][169] According to Index Translationum, as of 2020[update], she was the most-translated individual author.[170][171]\n\n\nChristie is one of the most-borrowed authors in UK libraries.[172][173][174][175] She is also the UK's best-selling spoken-book author. In 2002, 117,696 Christie audiobooks were sold, in comparison to 97,755 for J. K. Rowling, 78,770 for Roald Dahl and 75,841 for J. R. R. Tolkien.[176][177] In 2015, the Christie estate claimed *And Then There Were None* was \"the best-selling crime novel of all time\",[178] with approximately 100 million sales, also making it one of the highest-selling books of all time.[132][179] More than two million copies of her books were sold in English in 2020.[180]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Commemorative blue plaque in the West End marking *The Mousetrap* as the world's longest-running play\nIn 2016, the Royal Mail marked the centenary of Christie's first detective story by issuing six first-class postage stamps of her works: *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd*, *Murder on the Orient Express*, *And Then There Were None*, *The Body in the Library*, and *A Murder is Announced*. *The Guardian* reported that, \"Each design incorporates microtext, UV ink and thermochromic ink. These concealed clues can be revealed using either a magnifying glass, UV light or body heat and provide pointers to the mysteries' solutions.\"[181][182]\n\n\nHer characters and her face appeared on the stamps of many countries like Dominica and the Somali Republic.[183] In 2020, Christie was commemorated on a £2 coin by the Royal Mint for the first time to mark the centenary of her first novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*.[184]\n\n\nIn 2023 a life-size bronze statue of Christie sitting on a park bench holding a book was unveiled in Wallingford.[185]\n\n\n\n### Adaptations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adaptations of Agatha Christie\n\nChristie's works have been adapted for cinema and television. The first was the 1928 British film *The Passing of Mr. Quin*. Poirot's first film appearance was in 1931 in *Alibi*, which starred Austin Trevor as Christie's sleuth.[186]: 14–18 Margaret Rutherford played Marple in a series of films released in the 1960s. Christie liked her acting, but considered the first film \"pretty poor\" and thought no better of the rest.[14]: 430–31\nShe felt differently about the 1974 film *Murder on the Orient Express*, directed by Sidney Lumet, which featured major stars and high production values; her attendance at the London premiere was one of her last public outings.[14]: 476, 482[186]: 57 In 2017, a new film version was released, directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also starred, wearing \"the most extravagant mustache moviegoers have ever seen\".[187] Branagh has since directed two more adaptations of Christie, *Death on the Nile* (2022) and its sequel *A Haunting in Venice* (2023), the latter an adaptation of her 1969 novel *Hallowe'en Party*.[188][189]\n\n\nThe television adaptation *Agatha Christie's Poirot* (1989–2013), with David Suchet in the title role, ran for 70 episodes over 13 series. It received nine BAFTA award nominations and won four BAFTA awards in 1990–1992.[190] The television series *Miss Marple* (1984–1992), with Joan Hickson as \"the BBC's peerless Miss Marple\", adapted all 12 Marple novels.[14]: 500 The French television series *Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie* (2009–2012, 2013–2020), adapted 36 of Christie's stories.[191][192]\n\n\nChristie's books have also been adapted for BBC Radio, a video game series, and graphic novels.[193][194][195][196]\n\n\n\n## Interests and influences[edit]\n\n\n### Pharmacology[edit]\n\n\nDuring the First World War, Christie took a break from nursing to train for the Apothecaries Hall Examination.[124]: xi While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up to date at Torquay Hospital.[12]: 235, 470\n\n\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons ... These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories.\"[124]: viii There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists, and scientists, naïve or suspicious, in Christie's cast of characters; featuring in *Murder in Mesopotamia*, *Cards on the Table*, *The Pale Horse*, and *Mrs. McGinty's Dead*, among many others.[124]\n\n\nGillian Gill notes that the murder method in Christie's first detective novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary\".[128]: 34 In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths ... I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"[197] With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under Ronald Knox's \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".[125]: 58 Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, nicotine, thallium, and other substances were used to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades.[124]\n\n\n\n### Archaeology[edit]\n\n\n> \n> The lure of the past came up to grab me. To see a dagger slowly appearing, with its gold glint, through the sand was romantic. The carefulness of lifting pots and objects from the soil filled me with a longing to be an archaeologist myself.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAgatha Christie[12]: 364\n\nIn her youth, Christie showed little interest in antiquities.[14]: 68 After her marriage to Mallowan in 1930, she accompanied him on annual expeditions, spending three to four months at a time in Syria and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, Nineveh, Tell Arpachiyah, Chagar Bazar, Tell Brak, and Nimrud.[14]: 301, 304, 313, 414 The Mallowans also took side trips whilst travelling to and from expedition sites, visiting Italy, Greece, Egypt, Iran, and the Soviet Union, among other places.[4]: 188–91, 199, 212[12]: 429–37 Their experiences travelling and living abroad are reflected in novels such as *Murder on the Orient Express*, *Death on the Nile*, and *Appointment with Death*.[14]: 514 (n. 6)[198]\n\n\nFor the 1931 digging season at Nineveh, Christie bought a writing table to continue her own work; in the early 1950s, she paid to add a small writing room to the team's house at Nimrud.[14]: 301[30]: 244 She also devoted time and effort each season in \"making herself useful by photographing, cleaning, and recording finds; and restoring ceramics, which she especially enjoyed\".[199][31]: 20–21 She also provided funds for the expeditions.[14]: 414\n\n\nMany of the settings for Christie's books were inspired by her archaeological fieldwork in the Middle East; this is reflected in the detail with which she describes them – for instance, the temple of Abu Simbel as depicted in *Death on the Nile* – while the settings for *They Came to Baghdad* were places she and Mallowan had recently stayed.[4]: 212, 283–84 Similarly, she drew upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig throughout *Murder in Mesopotamia*.[123]: 269 Archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts featured in her works include Dr Eric Leidner in *Murder in Mesopotamia* and Signor Richetti in *Death on the Nile*.[200]: 187, 226–27\n\n\nAfter the Second World War, Christie chronicled her time in Syria in *Come, Tell Me How You Live*, which she described as \"small beer – a very little book, full of everyday doings and happenings\".[201]: (Foreword) From 8 November 2001 to March 2002, The British Museum presented a \"colourful and episodic exhibition\" called *Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia* which illustrated how her activities as a writer and as the wife of an archaeologist intertwined.[202]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nSome of Christie's fictional portrayals have explored and offered accounts of her disappearance in 1926. The film *Agatha* (1979), with Vanessa Redgrave, has Christie sneaking away to plan revenge against her husband; Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution.[203] The *Doctor Who* episode \"The Unicorn and the Wasp\" (17 May 2008) stars Fenella Woolgar as Christie, and explains her disappearance as being connected to aliens. The film *Agatha and the Truth of Murder* (2018) sends her undercover to solve the murder of Florence Nightingale's goddaughter, Florence Nightingale Shore. A fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, *Agatha*.[204] *The Christie Affair*, a Christie-like mystery story of love and revenge by author Nina de Gramont, was a 2022 novel loosely based on Christie's disappearance.[205]\n\n\nOther portrayals, such as the Hungarian film *Kojak Budapesten* (1980), create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skills. In the TV play *Murder by the Book* (1986), Christie (Dame Peggy Ashcroft) murders one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's *Dorothy and Agatha* and *The London Blitz Murders* by Max Allan Collins.[206][207] The American television program *Unsolved Mysteries* devoted a segment to her famous disappearance, with Agatha portrayed by actress Tessa Pritchard. A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series *Gran Hotel* (2011) in which she finds inspiration to write her new novel while aiding local detectives. In the alternative history television film *Agatha and the Curse of Ishtar* (2018), Christie becomes involved in a murder case at an archaeological dig in Iraq.[208] In 2019, Honeysuckle Weeks portrayed Christie in an episode, \"No Friends Like Old Friends\", in a Canadian drama, *Frankie Drake Mysteries.*\n\n\nIn 2020, Heather Terrell, under the pseudonym of Marie Benedict, published *The Mystery of Mrs. Christie*, a fictional reconstruction of Christie's December 1926 disappearance. The novel was on the *USA Today* and *The New York Times* Best Seller lists.[209][210] In December 2020, Library Reads named Terrell a Hall of Fame author for the book.[211]\nAndrew Wilson has written four novels featuring Agatha Christie as a detective: *A Talent For Murder* (2017), *A Different Kind of Evil* (2018), *Death In A Desert Land* (2019) and *I Saw Him Die* (2020).[212] Christie was portrayed by Shirley Henderson in the 2022 comedy/mystery film *See How They Run*.[213][214]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Agatha Christie indult (an oecumenical request to which Christie was signatory seeking permission for the occasional use of the Tridentine (Latin) mass in England and Wales)\n* Agatha Awards (literary awards for mystery and crime writers)\n* Agatha Christie Award (Japan) (literary award for unpublished mystery novels)\n* List of solved missing person cases\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Most biographers give Christie's mother's place of birth as Belfast but do not provide sources. Current primary evidence, including census entries (place of birth Dublin), her baptism record (Dublin), and her father's service record and regimental history (when her father was in Dublin), indicates she was almost certainly born in Dublin in the first quarter of 1854.[8][9][10]\n2. **^** Boehmer's death registration states he died at age 49 from bronchitis after retiring from the army,[11] but Christie and her biographers have consistently claimed he was killed in a riding accident while still a serving officer.[12]: 5[13][4]: 2[14]: 9–10\n3. **^** Dorothy L. Sayers, who visited the \"scene of the disappearance\", later incorporated details in her book *Unnatural Death*.[40]\n4. **^** The notice placed by Christie in *The Times* (11 December 1926, p.1) gives the first name as Teresa, but her hotel register signature more naturally reads Tressa; newspapers reported that Christie used Tressa on other occasions during her disappearance (including joining a library).[45]\n5. **^** Christie hinted at a nervous breakdown, saying to a woman with similar symptoms, \"I think you had better be very careful; it is probably the beginning of a nervous breakdown.\"[12]: 337\n6. **^** Christie's authorised biographer includes an account of specialist psychiatric treatment following Christie's disappearance, but the information was obtained second or third hand after her death.[4]: 148–49, 159\n7. **^** Other authors claim Christie wrote *Murder on the Orient Express* whilst at a dig at Arpachiyah.[4]: 206[30]: 111\n8. **^** According to other sources, her estate was valued at £147 810.[90]\n9. **^** Christie's familial relationship to Margaret Miller (née West) was complex. As well as being Christie's maternal great-aunt, Miller was Christie's father's step-mother as well as Christie's mother's foster mother and step-mother-in-law – hence the appellation \"Auntie-Grannie\".\n10. **^** Wilson's 1945 essay, \"Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?\" was dismissive of the detective fiction genre in general but did not mention Christie by name.[157][158]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Most translated author\". *Guinness World Records*. 7 March 2017.\n2. **^** \"Result of world's favourite Christie global vote\". *Agatha Christie*. 22 December 2015.

He is best known as the author of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. His given name was **Cáo Zhān**  (曹霑) and his courtesy name was **Mèngruǎn** (simplified Chinese: 梦阮; traditional Chinese: 夢阮).\n\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nCao Xueqin was born to a Han Chinese clan[5] that was brought into personal service (as *booi aha* or bondservants of Cigu Niru) to the Manchu royalty in the late 1610s.[6] His ancestors distinguished themselves through military service in the Plain White Banner (正白旗) of the Eight Banners and subsequently held posts as officials which brought both prestige and wealth.[7]\n\n\nAfter the Plain White Banner was put under the direct jurisdiction of the Qing emperor, Cao's family began to serve in civil positions of the Imperial Household Department.\n\n\nDuring the Kangxi Emperor's reign, the clan's prestige and power reached its height. Cao Xueqin's grandfather, Cao Yin (曹寅), was a childhood playmate to Kangxi while Cao Yin's mother, Lady Sun (孫氏), was Kangxi's wet nurse. Two years after his ascension, Kangxi appointed Cao Xueqin's great-grandfather, Cao Xi (曹璽), as the Commissioner of Imperial Textiles (織造) in Jiangning (present-day Nanjing), and the family relocated there.[8]\n\n\nWhen Cao Xi died in 1684, Cao Yin, as Kangxi's personal confidant, took over the post. Cao Yin was one of the era's most prominent men of letters and a keen book collector. Jonathan Spence notes the strong Manchu element in the lives of these Imperial Household bond servants. They balanced the two cultures: Cao Yin took pleasure in horse riding and hunting and Manchu military culture, but was at the same time a sensitive interpreter of Chinese culture to the Manchus. By the early 18th century, the Cao clan had become so rich and influential as to be able to play host four times to the Kangxi Emperor in his six separate itinerant trips south to the Nanjing region. In 1705, the emperor ordered Cao Yin, himself a poet, to compile all surviving *shi* (lyric poems) from the Tang dynasty, which resulted in *The Complete Poems of the Tang*.[8]\n\n\nWhen Cao Yin died in 1712, Kangxi passed the office over to Cao Yin's only son, Cao Yong (曹顒). Cao Yong died in 1715. Kangxi then allowed the family to adopt a paternal nephew, Cao Fu (曹頫), as Cao Yin's posthumous son to continue in that position. Hence the clan held the office of Imperial Textile Commissioner at Jiangning for three generations.\n\n\nThe family's fortunes lasted until Kangxi's death and the ascension of the Yongzheng Emperor to the throne. Yongzheng severely attacked the family and in 1727 confiscated their properties, while Cao Fu was thrown in jail.[7] This was ostensibly for their mismanagement of funds, though perhaps this purge was politically motivated. When Cao Fu was released a year later, the impoverished family was forced to relocate to Beijing. Cao Xueqin, still a young child, lived in poverty with his family.\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cao Xueqin Memorial Museum in Nanjing.\nAlmost no records of Cao's early childhood and adulthood have survived. Redology scholars are still debating Cao's exact date of birth, though he is known to have been around forty to fifty at his death.[9] Cao Xueqin was the son of either Cao Fu or Cao Yong.[10] It is known for certain that Cao Yong's only son was born posthumously in 1715; some Redologists believe this son might be Cao Xueqin. In the clan register (五慶堂曹氏宗譜), however, Cao Yong's only son was recorded as a certain Cao Tianyou (曹天佑). Further complicating matters for Redologists is the fact that neither the names Cao Zhan nor Cao Xueqin—names that his contemporaries knew him by—can be traced in the register.[11]\n\n\nMost of what we know about Cao was passed down from his contemporaries and friends.[12] Cao eventually settled in the countryside west of Beijing where he lived the larger part of his later years in poverty selling off his paintings. Cao was recorded as an inveterate drinker. Friends and acquaintances recalled an intelligent, highly talented man who spent a decade working diligently on a work that must have been *Dream of the Red Chamber*. \"Born in the prosperous, finally degenerate.\" Cao Xueqin's family fate has changed from the status like blooming of flowers to the state of decline, making him deeply experience the sorrow of life and the ruthlessness of the world, and also get rid of the mundanity and narrowness of his original social class. The trend of decadence also brought disillusionment and sentimentality. His tragic experience, his poetic emotion, his spirit of exploration, and his sense of innovation are all cast into \"Dream of the Red Chamber\". They praised both his stylish paintings, particularly of cliffs and rocks, and originality in poetry, which they likened to Li He's. Cao died some time in 1763 or 1764, leaving his novel in a very advanced stage of completion. (At least the first draft had been completed, some pages of the manuscript were lost after being borrowed by friends or relatives.) He was survived by a wife after the death of a son.\n\n\nCao achieved posthumous fame through his life's work. *Dream of the Red Chamber* is a vivid recreation of an illustrious family at its height and its subsequent downfall, and the novel was \"semi-autobiographical\" in nature.[13] A small group of close family and friends appeared to have been transcribing his manuscript when Cao died quite suddenly in 1763–4, apparently out of grief owing to the death of a son. Extant handwritten copies of this work—some 80 chapters—had been in circulation in Beijing shortly after Cao's death and scribal copies soon became prized collectors' items.\n\n\nIn 1791, Cheng Weiyuan (程偉元) and Gao E (高鶚), who claimed to have access to Cao's working papers, edited and published a \"complete\" 120-chapter version. This was its first woodblock print edition. Reprinted a year later with more revisions, this 120-chapter edition is the novel's most printed version. Many modern scholars question the authorship of the last 40 chapters of the novel, whether it was actually completed by Cao Xueqin.[2]\n\n\nTo this very day, Cao continues to be influential on new generations of Chinese novelists and poets, such as Middle Generation's An Qi, who paid homage to him in her poem *To Cao Xueqin*.[14]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![](image)Literature portal\n* ![icon](image)Novels portal\n* ![icon](image)Poetry portal\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n\n\n* Chinese literature\n* List of Chinese authors\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The precise dating of Cao Xueqin's birth and death is a matter of heated debate amongst Chinese Redologists. It would be fair however to confine Cao's birth date to between 1715 and 1724, as attested by the elegiac poems by his friends – Duncheng (敦誠) and Zhang Yiquan (張宜泉) – which stated Cao was forty and nearly fifty respectively when he died.
