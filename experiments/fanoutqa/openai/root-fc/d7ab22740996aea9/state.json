The country is secular and the freedom of religion is enshrined in the nation's constitution.\n\n\nThe pre-Hispanic peoples that lived in actual Honduras were primarily polytheistic Maya and other native groups. In the 16th century, Roman Catholicism was introduced by the Spanish Empire and still holds a 46% share of the population. Protestantism accounts for 41% of the country's population.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Ancient religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mayan God Chaac in Copan sculpture museum\nThe Maya religion was the ancient one. It was practiced a lot in the timeline of the 4th and 7th century, AD. It was practiced in some parts of Central and South America, and it was based on polytheistic beliefs and had to do with a big number of rituals with occasional animals and maybe even human sacrifices. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Post-colonial religion[edit]\n\n\nThe second Roman Catholic Mass celebrated in the continental New World was on August 13, 1502, in Punta Caxinas, two weeks after the so-called \"discovery\" of Honduras by Christopher Columbus.[2][3] Thereafter, the Spanish began a process of converting and baptizing Honduran natives to the Catholic faith.\n\n\nHonduras holds a small part of the former Mosquito Coast which came under British influence\u2014now in the extreme southeast of the state. Protestant churches gained following in that sparsely populated area on the Caribbean coast, especially Anglicanism and the Moravian Church.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cathedral of Saint Michael the Archangel\nIn recent years, the principal religious groups are Roman Catholic, Episcopal, Lutheran, Jehovah's Witness, Mennonite, approximately 300 evangelical Protestant groups, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and well as communities of Muslims, Jews and Baha'is.[4]\n\n\nThe Catholic Church in Honduras is composed of eight dioceses: Tegucigalpa, Comayagua, Choluteca, Olancho, Yoro, San Pedro Sula, Trujillo and Cop\u00e1n which are a part of the Conference Episcopal of Honduras.\n\n\nThe Protestant churches are structured by three confederacies: The Pastors' Association of Honduras, the Evangelical Brotherhood of Honduras and the Apostolic Network of Honduras.\n\n\nBoth the Roman Catholic Church as well as the Protestant churches, especially the Pentecostal denominations, have experienced growth thanks in large part to modern forms of mass communication in recent decades.\n\n\nThe LDS Church built a temple in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, making it one of the six LDS temples in Central America.\n\n\nThe most prominent evangelical churches in the country include the \"Abundant Life\", the \"Living Love\", and the Great Commission Churches.[4] A growing number of evangelical churches have no denominational affiliation.[4] The National Association of Evangelical Pastors represents the evangelical leadership.[5] San Pedro Sula has a mosque and a synagogue, and Tegucigalpa has a synagogue.[5]\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2020 survey, CID-Gallup reported that 48% of the population identifies as evangelical Protestant and 34% as Roman Catholic; Catholic Church officials, however, state that 75% of the population is Catholic.[4]\n\n\nLocal religious leaders state that there are approximately 7000 Muslims (mostly Sunni), 1000 Baha\u2019is and 150 Jews.[4]\n\n\n\n## Religious freedom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colonial Roman Catholic church in Duyure, Honduras\n![](image)Roman catholic church of San Juan in Ojojona, Honduras\nThe constitution of Honduras establishes the freedom of religion. The National Congress of Honduras has the power to legally recognize religious groups, which confers to them tax-exempt status and other privileges. The Catholic Church is the only organization legally recognized as a religious group, although other religious groups can register with the government as NGOs. Some religious groups have criticized this as constituting preferential treatment for the Catholic Church at the expense of other groups.[6]\n\n\nThe constitution prohibits religious leaders from holding elected office or publicly making political statements. Despite this, some Protestant pastors have been elected to government positions and serve on government advisory bodies. The government also frequently includes Catholic or Protestant prayers as part of official events and ceremonies, which has been criticized by representatives of other religious groups.[6]\n\n\nClergy are provided exemptions from being required to testify in court about information acquired from religious confessions. Vicars, bishops, and archbishops of the Catholic Church, as well as similarly high-ranking members of other religions, are not required to appear in court if subpoenaed, although they are required to make a statement for the court.[4]\n\n\nPublic schools do not teach religion but, private schools may include religion on their curricula if they wish.[4]\n\n\nForeign missionaries must register with the government. Some religious groups have reached agreements with the government to expedite this process;[4] however, some groups have noted difficulties in obtaining visas for longer than six months. \n\n\nConscientious objection to military service is protected by law, including objection on religious grounds.[6]\n\n\nSome politicians, generally from opposition parties, have regularly used antisemitism rhetoric in their political statements.[6][*dead link*]\n\n\nIn 2023, the country was scored 4 out of 4 for religious freedom according to Freedom House.[7]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Islam in Honduras\n* Roman Catholicism in Honduras\n* Virgin of Suyapa, perhaps Honduras' most popular religious image.\n* Religion in Latin America\n* ![flag](image) Honduras portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Catholic Apathy Leads To Growth Of Evangelical Christian Churches In Latin America\". *Ken on Threats*. 2022-11-16.

Divisions, according to 2012 census.\nSri Lanka is officially a Buddhist country, while Sri Lankans practice a variety of religions. As of the 2012 census, 70.2% of Sri Lankans were Buddhists, 12.6% were Hindus, 9.7% were Muslims (mainly Sunni), 7.4% were Christians (mostly Catholics).[1][2] Buddhism is declared as the State religion of Sri Lanka and has been given special privileges in the Sri Lankan constitution such as the government is bound for protection and fostering of Buddhist Dharma throughout the nation.[3][4] However, the constitution also provides for freedom of religion and right to equality among all its citizens. In 2008 Sri Lanka was the third most religious country in the world according to a Gallup poll, with 99% of Sri Lankans saying religion is an important part of their daily life.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Distribution of religious groups[edit]\n\n\nThe census 2001 covered 18 districts only. The district percentages shown are from 2001 census except where the numbers are italic, which are from 1981 census. Population movements have occurred after 1981, and accurate statistics did not exist for districts which were not covered in 2001 census until the 2011 census.[6]\n\n\n\n* Data from the 2011 census\n* ![Buddhists](image)\n\nBuddhists\n* ![Hindus](image)\n\nHindus\n* ![Muslims](image)\n\nMuslims\n* ![Christians](image)\n\nChristians\n\n\n\n### Religion by Province[edit]\n\n\n\n\nReligion by Province in Sri Lanka [1]\n| Province\n | Buddhism | %\n | Hinduism | %\n | Islam | %\n | Christianity | %\n | Others\n | %\n | Total\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Central Province | 1,672,625\n | 65.05%\n | 540,339\n | 21.01%\n | 263,874\n | 10.26%\n | 94,402\n | 3.67%\n | 317\n | 0.01%\n | 2,571,557\n | 100%\n |\n| Eastern Province | 354,772\n | 22.87%\n | 539,570\n | 34.78%\n | 575,936\n | 37.12%\n | 80,801\n | 5.21%\n | 302\n | 0.02%\n | 1,551,381\n | 100%\n |\n| North Central Province | 1,139,595\n | 90%\n | 10,117\n | 0.79%\n | 101,958\n | 8.03%\n | 14,875\n | 1.17%\n | 188\n | 0.01%\n | 1,266,663\n | 100%\n |\n| Northern Province | 30,387\n | 2.87%\n | 789,362\n | 74.56%\n | 34,040\n | 3.22%\n | 204,005\n | 19.27%\n | 968\n | 0.09%\n | 1,058,762\n | 100%\n |\n| North Western Province | 1,761,337\n | 73.98%\n | 43,532\n | 1.83%\n | 268,709\n | 11.28%\n | 305,951\n | 12.85%\n | 1,332\n | 0.06%\n | 2,380,861\n | 100%\n |\n| Sabaragamuwa Province | 1,653,381\n | 85.73%\n | 156,312\n | 8.1%\n | 85,610\n | 4.44%\n | 33,219\n | 1.72%\n | 133\n | 0.006%\n | 1,928,655\n | 100%\n |\n| Southern Province | 2,345,314\n | 94.68%\n | 33,227\n | 1.34%\n | 80,085\n | 3.23%\n | 18,201\n | 0.73%\n | 458\n | 0.02%\n | 2,477,285\n | 100%\n |\n| Uva Province | 1,018,561\n | 80.43%\n | 169,605\n | 13.39%\n | 57,001\n | 4.5%\n | 21,095\n | 1.66%\n | 201\n | 0.02%\n | 1,266,463\n | 100%\n |\n| Western Province | 4,088,797\n | 70.67%\n | 274,336\n | 4.71%\n | 709,992\n | 10.81%\n | 752,993\n | 12.93%\n | 4,592\n | 0.08%\n | 5,830,710\n | 100%\n |\n\n\n## Buddhism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Buddhism in Sri Lanka\n\n![](image)Exterior of the sacred temple of the Tooth in Kandy.\nTheravada Buddhism is the official religion of Sri Lanka, with about 70.2% of the country's population as followers. Arahath Mahinda, son of Indian Buddhist emperor Ashoka, led the mission to Sri Lanka in 246 BCE when he converted the Sri Lankan king, Devanampiya Tissa, to Buddhism. Arahath Sanghamitra, daughter of King Ashoka, brought a sapling of the Bodhi tree in Buddha Gaya to Sri Lanka. She also established the Order of Nuns in Sri Lanka. The Sapling of the Bodhi tree, known as Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi was planted in the Mahameghavana Park in Anuradhapura by the King Devanampiya Tissa.\n\n\nFrom then on, the royal families had helped to encourage the spread of Buddhism, aiding Buddhist missionaries and building monasteries. Around 200 BCE, Buddhism became the official religion of Sri Lanka. The Sacred Tooth Relic was brought to Sri Lanka in 4th century by Prince Danta and Princess Hemamala. Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any Buddhist nation. During the periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contacts with Myanmar and Thailand. Later on, however, Hindu invasions and European colonial influences contributed to the decline of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.\n\n\nBut during the last period of the European colonial period and the post-colonial period, Buddhism has gained a growth in Sri Lanka. Buddhism was 61.57% in 1881 in Sri Lanka. Buddhism has increased to 70.2% in Sri Lanka when it's 2012.[7]\n\n\nIn the mid 18th century the higher ordination of Buddhist monks known as Upasampada, which was defunct at the time, was revived with the help of Siamese Buddhist monks on the initiatives taken by Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero during the reign of king Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy. By the mid-19th century, Buddhist leaders such as Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera, Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera, Colonel Henry Steel Olcott and Anagarika Dharmapala started a successful national Buddhist movement for the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuddhism in Sri Lanka 1881-2012[8][1]\n| Year\n | Buddhism | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1881 census[9] | 1,698,100\n | 61.57%\n |\n| 1891 census[10] | 1,877,000\n | 62.40%\n |\n| 1901 census[11] | 2,141,400\n | 60.06%\n |\n| 1911 census[12] | 2,474,200\n | 60.25%\n |\n| 1921 census[13] | 2,769,800\n | 61.57%\n |\n| 1931 census[14] | 3,266,600\n | 61.55%\n |\n| 1946 Estimation[15] | 4,294,900\n | 64.51%\n |\n| 1953 census[16] | 5,209,400\n | 64.33%\n |\n| 1963 census[17] | 7,003,300\n | 66.18%\n |\n| 1971 census[18] | 8,536,868\n | 67.27%\n |\n| 1981 census[19] | 10,288,325\n | 69.30%\n |\n| 2012 census[1][19] | 14,272,056\n | 70.20%\n |\n\n\n## Hinduism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Ravana at Koneswaram Temple.\nMain article: Hinduism in Sri Lanka\n\nHindus make up 12.6% of Sri Lanka's population.[2] Hinduism was practiced by Native Kings before their conversion to Buddhism. The origins of the religion are linked to early Tamil immigration into the island since the Chola conquests in the 10th century or even earlier with the Saivite devotional movement that swept South India.\n\n\nHinduism in Sri Lanka is largely identified with the Tamil population and is concentrated in the Northern, Eastern and Central Provinces. The population declined since the 1981 census on account of Sri Lankan Tamil emigration overseas and the repatriation of 'Indian' Tamils.\n\n\nA significant Hindu religious figure in Sri Lankan modern history is Satguru Siva Yogaswami of Jaffna. One of the mystics of the 20th century, Yogaswami was the official satguru and counseling sage of Lanka's several million Tamil Hindu population. The Ramakrishna Mission is somewhat active in the Amparai and Batticaloa districts while the Shaiva Siddhanta school of philosophy of Shaivism sect of Hinduism is prevalent in the North of Sri Lanka. Yogaswami belonged to the Shaiva Siddhanta and he was 161st head of the Nandinatha Sampradaya. The next person in the line of succession after Yogaswami was Sivaya Subramuniyaswami.[20]\n\n\n\n## Islam[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Meeran Mosque in Galle.\nMain article: Islam in Sri Lanka\n\nBy the 7th century, Arab traders had controlled much of the trade on the Indian Ocean, including that of Sri Lanka's. Many of these traders settled down in Sri Lanka, encouraging the spread of Islam. However, when the Portuguese arrived at Sri Lanka during the 16th century, many of the Arabs' Muslim descendants were persecuted, thus forcing them to migrate to the Central Highlands and to the east coast.\n\n\nIn modern times, Muslims in Sri Lanka have the Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs Department, which was established in the 1980s to prevent the continual isolation of the Muslim community from the rest of Sri Lanka. Today, about 9.7% of Sri Lankans adhere to Islam;[2] mostly from the Moor and Malay ethnic communities on the island.\n\n\n\n## Christianity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo.\nMain article: Christianity in Sri Lanka\n\nAccording to a Christian tradition, Christianity was introduced by Thomas the Apostle in Sri Lanka (as well as India) during the 1st century. The first evidence of Christianity in Sri Lanka is the account in the 6th-century *Christian Topography*, which says a community of Persian Nestorians lived on the island. The Anuradhapura cross, discovered in 1912, is probably a relic of this community. However, the population of Christians in Sri Lanka didn't dramatically increase until the arrival of Portuguese missionaries during the 15th century. In the 17th century, the Dutch took over Sri Lanka and Dutch missionaries were able to convert 21% of Sri Lanka's population to Christianity by 1622.\n\n\nIn 1796 the Dutch were displaced by the British and in 1802 Ceylon became a Crown colony. Anglican and other Protestant missionaries arrived at Sri Lanka during the early 19th century, when the British took control of Sri Lanka from the Dutch. Under British rule missionary work was undertaken by English societies: Baptist, Wesleyan Methodist, the CMS and SPG.[21] The Salvation Army and Jehovah's Witnesses are also present in Sri Lanka.\n\n\nThe percentage of Christians has slowly declined from the height of 13% in 1891 they were 12.6% and numbered were 302,000. In 2012 they 7.4%. By the 1980s, the population of Christians was mostly concentrated in the northwest of Sri Lanka and in the capital where they are 10% of the population. Of these Christians, over 80% are Roman Catholics while the rest are predominantly Anglicans, Methodists and other Protestants.\n\n\n\n## Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith[edit]\n\n\nAdherents of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith have been present in Sri Lanka since 1949. The first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed resident in Colombo was a physician from India, M.E. Lukmani. Its population grew in the 1950s and by 1962, its first administrative body for the national level (the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds of Sri Lanka) was elected.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)Distribution of languages and religious groups of Sri Lanka by D.S. divisions and sector level, according to the 1981 census.\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* History of Sri Lanka\n* Freedom of religion in Sri Lanka\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"A3\u00a0: Population by religion according to districts, 2012\". *Census of Population & Housing, 2011*.

In the 2021 national census, 43.9% of Australians identified with Christianity and 38.9% declared \"no religion\".\n\n\nAustralia has no official religion. Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia states: \"The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.\"\n\n\nThe Christian festivals of Easter and Christmas are public holidays.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe Aboriginal peoples of Australia traditionally followed a set of beliefs known as The Dreaming; some of the earliest evidence on earth for religious practices among humans has been found in the archaeological record of their ancestors.[*citation needed*] Torres Strait Islander religion bore similarities to broader Melanesian spirituality.\n\n\nChristianity came to Australia in 1788 with British colonial settlement.[4] Of the convicts and free settlers, most were members of the established Church of England with lesser numbers of Nonconformist Protestants, Catholics and other faiths. The first religious census in 1828 divided the early colony into four groups: Protestants, Catholics, Jews and Pagans.[5]\n\n\nOther smaller groups also arrived and established their churches. Jews started arriving in the early 19th century. The Australian gold rushes brought in workers from China and the Pacific islands, as well as specialised workers from British India, such as the mainly Muslim \"Afghan Cameleers\".\n\n\n\n### Indigenous Australian religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Stolen Generations\n\n![](image)Kolaia man wearing a headdress worn in a fire ceremony, Forrest River, Western Australia\nDreaming (spirituality) has been practised for tens of thousands of years. It is at once a collection of stories of an ancient view of creation and present day spirituality. It places significant emphasis on belonging to the land. It shaped and continues to shape Aboriginal law and customs; and Aboriginal art, story and dance continue to draw on these spiritual traditions.\n\n\nThere is evidence of contact between indigenous Australians with colonisers, fishermen, and survivors of numerous shipwrecks from peoples of various non-Indigenous cultures and faiths prior to British colonisation. Indigenous Australians of (Arnhem Land) (in Northern Australia) retain stories, songs and paintings of trade and cultural interaction with sea-faring peoples from the north, generally regarded as being from the east Indonesian archipelago.[6] There is some evidence of Islamic terms and concepts entering northern Aboriginal cultures via these interactions.[7][8] (See: Macassan contact with Australia.)\n\n\n\n![](image)Hermannsburg Aboriginal Mission, Northern Territory\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Richard Johnson, Anglican priest and chaplain to the First Fleet\nWhile the Church of England originally held a position of privilege in early colonial Australia, a legal framework guaranteeing religious equality evolved within a few decades,[9] especially when the Church of England was disestablished in the colony of New South Wales by the *Church Act of 1836*. Drafted by the reformist attorney-general John Plunkett,[10] the act established legal equality for Anglicans, Catholics and Presbyterians, and was later extended to Methodists. British Nonconformist Methodist, Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Baptists set up their own churches in the 19th century, as did Lutherans from Germany.[11][12]\n\n\nLarge numbers of Irish Catholics were transported to Australia through the British criminal justice system.[13] Religious tensions, largely fuelled by historical grievances between Catholics and other Christians, continued into the 20th century.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scot's Church, Melbourne, c.\u20091880\nThe gold rush of the 1850s led to significantly increased immigration and diversity of religious traditions, such as Irish Catholicism, Scottish Presbyterianism, and more English Anglicanism, among other religious traditions.\n\n\nAustralian Aboriginal peoples suffered a decline during this period as they were dispossessed of their lands; and diseases spread among their populations. Christian churches organised missions during this period, intended to \"civilise\" Aboriginal communities and spread Christianity. The overall consequences of this activity contributed to the decline of indigenous languages and beliefs, the extent to which are still being determined and recorded.\n\n\nBy 1901, apart from the indigenous population and descendants of gold rush migrants, Australian society was predominantly Anglo-Celtic, with 40% of the population being Anglican, 23% Catholic, 34% other Christian and about 1% professing non-Christian religions.[15] There was a Lutheran population of German descent in South Australia.\n\n\nFreedom of Religion was enshrined in Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia of 1901.\n\n\n\n### Other religions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Perth Shiva Temple, Perth, Western Australia\n![](image)19th century mosque, Bourke, New South Wales\n![](image)Phap Hoa Vietnamese Buddhist temple, Adelaide, South Australia\nThere were at least 15 Jews in the First Fleet, 14 convicts and one \"free\" child.[16]\n\n\nThe Tolpuddle Martyrs were sentenced to penal transportation to Australia because friendly societies had strong elements of what are now considered to be the predominant role of trade unions.[17]\n\n\nAs noted above, the Australian gold rushes brought in workers from China and the Pacific islands, as well as specialised workers from British India such as, from the 1860s onwards, the mainly Muslim \"Afghan Cameleers\". From the 1870s Malay divers were recruited (with most subsequently repatriated). Before 1901, some Muslim sailors and prisoners came to Australia on convict ships. \n\n\nIn 1901, the government passed an act limiting immigration to those of European descent in what came to be known as the White Australia Policy. By effectively limiting the immigration of practitioners of different faiths, this policy ensured that Christianity remained the religion of the overwhelming majority of Australians for the foreseeable future and, indeed, to the present day. The first census in 1911 showed 96% identified themselves as Christian.[18] Sectarian tensions continued into the 1960s; e.g. job vacancy advertisements sometimes stated \"Protestant preferred\" or that \"Catholics need not apply\".[4] Nevertheless, Australia elected its first Catholic prime minister, James Scullin, in 1929, and in 1930 Sir Isaac Isaacs, an Australian-born Jew, was appointed Governor-General.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Demography of Australia\n\nA question on religion has been asked in every census taken in Australia, with the voluntary nature of this question having been specifically stated since 1933. In 1971, the instruction \"if no religion, write none\" was introduced. This saw a sevenfold increase from the previous census year in the percentage of Australians stating they had no religion. Since 1971, this percentage has progressively increased to 38.9% in 2021.\n\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2006 Census Dictionary statement on religious affiliation states the purpose for gathering such information:\n\n\n\n\n> Data on religious affiliation are used for such purposes as planning educational facilities, aged persons' care and other social services provided by religion-based organisations; the location of church buildings; the assigning of chaplains to hospitals, prisons, armed services and universities; the allocation of time on public radio and other media; and sociological research.\n> \n> \n\n\nThe census question about religion is optional, and asks \"What is the person's religion?\", giving respondents a choice of nine religions, \"Other\" and \"No religion\".[21] At the 2016 census 9.6% of people declined to answer, or they did not give a response adequate for interpretation.[22] This figure dropped to 7.2% in 2021.\n\n\nThe 2021 Australian census data showed that 43.9% of Australians classify themselves Christian, 8.2% less in real terms than five years prior,[23] The second-largest classification was the 38.9% who identified as \"no religion\".\n\n\nAs in many Western countries, the level of active participation in church worship is much lower than this; weekly attendance at church services is likely to be under 1 million, about 4% of the population.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe fastest growing religious classifications over the fifteen years between 2006 and 2021 were:\n\n\n\n* No religion \u2013 up from 18.7% to 38.9%\n* Islam \u2013 up from 1.7% to 3.2%\n* Hinduism \u2013 up from 0.7% to 2.7%\n* Sikhism \u2013 up from 0.1% to 0.8%\n* Buddhism - from 2.1% to 2.4%\n\n\nMeanwhile, all Christian denominations combined decreased from 63.9% to 43.9%.\n\n\n\n### Census data[edit]\n\n\n\n\nReligious declarations of Australians according to the censuses of 1986 to 2021[24][25][26][22][27][1]\n| Affiliation\n | 1986\n | 1996\n | 2006\n | 2011\n | 2016\n | 2021\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Count ('000) | %\n | Count ('000) | %\n | Count ('000) | %\n | Count ('000) | %\n | Count ('000) | %\n | Count ('000) | %\n |\n| 10 Anglican | 3,723.4\n | 23.9\n | 3,903.3\n | 22.0\n | 3,718.3\n | 18.7\n | 3,680.0\n | 17.1\n | 3,101.2\n | 13.3\n | 2,496.3\n | 9.8\n |\n| 10 Baptist | 196.8\n | 1.3\n | 295.2\n | 1.7\n | 316.7\n | 1.6\n | 352.5\n | 1.6\n | 345.1\n | 1.5\n | 347.3\n | 1.4\n |\n| 10 Catholic Catholic | 4,064.4\n | 26.1\n | 4,799.0\n | 27.0\n | 5,126.9\n | 25.8\n | 5,439.2\n | 25.3\n | 5,291.8\n | 22.6\n | 5,075.9\n | 20.0\n |\n| 10 Churches of Christ | 88.5\n | 0.6\n | 75.0\n | 0.4\n | 54.8\n | 0.3\n | 49.7\n | 0.2\n | 39.6\n | 0.2\n | 35.9\n | 0.1\n |\n| 10 Jehovah's Witnesses | 66.5\n | 0.4\n | 83.4\n | 0.5\n | 80.9\n | 0.4\n | 85.6\n | 0.4\n | 82.5\n | 0.4\n | 84.4\n | 0.3\n |\n| 10 Latter Day Saints | 35.5\n | 0.2\n | 45.2\n | 0.3\n | 53.1\n | 0.3\n | 59.8\n | 0.3\n | 61.6\n | 0.3\n | 57.9\n | 0.2\n |\n| 10 Lutheran | 208.3\n | 1.3\n | 250.0\n | 1.4\n | 251.1\n | 1.3\n | 251.9\n | 1.2\n | 174\n | 0.7\n | 145.9\n | 0.6\n |\n| 10 Eastern Orthodox | 427.4\n | 2.5\n | 497.3\n | 2.5\n | 544.3\n | 2.6\n | 563.1\n | 2.6\n | 582.8\n | 2.6\n | 535.5\n | 2.1\n |\n| 10 Pentecostal | 107.0\n | 0.7\n | 174.6\n | 1.0\n | 219.6\n | 1.1\n | 238.0\n | 1.1\n | 260.6\n | 1.1\n | 259.8\n | 1.1\n |\n| 10 Presbyterian & Reformed | 560.0\n | 3.6\n | 675.5\n | 3.8\n | 596.7\n | 3.0\n | 599.5\n | 2.8\n | 526.7\n | 2.3\n | 414.9\n | 1.6\n |\n| 10 Salvation Army | 77.8\n | 0.5\n | 74.1\n | 0.4\n | 64.2\n | 0.3\n | 60.2\n | 0.3\n | 48.9\n | 0.2\n | 35.4\n | 0.1\n |\n| 10 Seventh-day Adventist | 48.0\n | 0.3\n | 52.7\n | 0.3\n | 55.3\n | 0.3\n | 63.0\n | 0.3\n | 62.9\n | 0.3\n | 63.7\n | 0.3\n |\n| 10 Uniting Church | 1,182.3\n | 7.6\n | 1,334.9\n | 7.5\n | 1,135.4\n | 5.7\n | 1,065.8\n | 5.0\n | 870.2\n | 3.7\n | 673.3\n | 2.7\n |\n| 12 Other Christian\n | 596.0\n | 3.8\n | 322.7\n | 1.8\n | 468.6\n | 2.4\n | 642.4\n | 3.0\n | 833.5\n | 3.6\n | 926.8\n | 3.7\n |\n| 15 **Christian total** | **11,381.9** | **73.0** | **12,582.9** | **70.9** | **12,685.9** | **63.9** | **13,150.6** | **61.1** | **12,201.6** | **52.1** | **11,148.8** | **43.9** |\n| 20 Buddhism | 80.4\n | 0.5\n | 199.8\n | 1.1\n | 418.8\n | 2.1\n | 529.0\n | 2.5\n | 563.7\n | 2.4\n | 615.8\n | 2.4\n |\n| 20 Hinduism | 21.5\n | 0.1\n | 67.3\n | 0.4\n | 148.1\n | 0.7\n | 275.5\n | 1.3\n | 440.3\n | 1.9\n | 684.0\n | 2.7\n |\n| 20 Sikhism |  |  | 12.0\n | <0.1\n | 26.4\n | 0.1\n | 72.3\n | 0.4\n | 125.9\n | 0.5\n | 210.4\n | 0.8\n |\n| 20 Islam | 109.5\n | 0.7\n | 200.9\n | 1.1\n | 340.4\n | 1.7\n | 476.3\n | 2.2\n | 604.2\n | 2.6\n | 813.4\n | 3.2\n |\n| 20 Judaism | 69.1\n | 0.4\n | 79.8\n | 0.4\n | 88.8\n | 0.4\n | 97.3\n | 0.5\n | 91\n | 0.4\n | 100.0\n | 0.4\n |\n| 20 Other non-Christian\n | 35.7\n | 0.2\n | 56.6\n | 0.3\n | 82.6\n | 0.4\n | 95.9\n | 0.4\n | 95.7\n | 0.4\n | 115.0\n | 0.5\n |\n| 25 **Non-Christian total** | **316.2** | **2.0** | **616.4** | **3.5** | **1,105.1** | **5.6** | **1,546.3** | **7.2** | **1,920.8** | **8.2** | **2,538.6** | **10.0** |\n| **30** **No religion1** | **1,977.5** | **12.7** | **2,948.9** | **16.6** | **3,706.5** | **18.7** | **4,796.8** | **22.3** | **7,040.7** | **30.1** | **9,887.0** | **38.9** |\n| **40** Not stated**2** | 1,926.6\n | 12.3\n | 1,604.8\n | 9.0\n | 2,357.8\n | 11.9\n | 2,014.0\n | 9.4\n | 2,345.5\n | 10\n | 1,751.4\n | 7.3\n |\n| **Totals3** | **15,602.1** | **100.0** | **17,753.0** | **100.0** | **19,855.3** | **100.0** | **21,507.7** | **100.0** | **23,401.4** | **100.0** | **25,422.8** | **100.0** |\n\n\n1: Includes relatively small numbers declaring \"secular beliefs\", such as atheism, agnosticism, humanism and rationalism, and spiritual beliefs such as New Age, \"own spiritual beliefs\", theism(!), etc. See 7[28]\n\n\n2: Includes \"inadequately described\"\n\n\n3: Due to rounding, figures may not add up to the totals shown.\n\n\n\n### Line and bar charts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Religious affiliation in Australia, 1971-2021\n\"Over the past 50 years, there has been a steady decline in the proportion of Australians who reported an affiliation with Christianity. The same period has seen a consistent rise in Other religions and No religion, particularly in the last 20 years\".[29]\n\n\n\n### Total fertility rates[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2016[update], Buddhists (1.68), Hindus (1.81) and the non-religious (1.84) had the lowest fertility rates. Christians (2.11) and Jews (2.17) had moderate fertility rates, and Muslims had the highest rate at 3.03.[30]\n\n\n\n## Indigenous Australian traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indigenous Australians, Australian Aboriginal mythology, and Dreaming (spirituality)\n\n![](image)Illustration of an Aboriginal corroboree ceremony by William Barak c.1898\nDreaming (spirituality)\u2014the Dreaming or Dreaming\u2014places significant emphasis on belonging to the land. It is at once a collection of stories of an ancient view of creation and present day Dreaming (spirituality). It shaped and continues to shape Aboriginal law and customs; and Aboriginal art, story and dance continue to draw on these spiritual traditions. \n\n\nThere were a great many different nations, each with their own individual culture, belief structure, and language. The Rainbow Serpent is a major dream spirit for Aboriginal people across Australia. The Yowie and Bunyip are other well known dream spirits. At the time of the British settlement, traditional religions were animist and tended to have elements of ancestor worship.\n\n\nAboriginal beliefs and spirituality, even among those Aboriginal peoples who identify themselves as members of a traditional organised religion, are intrinsically linked to the land generally and to certain sites of significance in particular. As Mircea Eliade put it, \"There is a general belief among the [indigenous] Australians that the world, man, and the various animals and plants were created by certain Supernatural beings who afterwards disappeared, either ascending to the sky or entering the earth.\"[31] There were and still are ritual systems, with an emphasis on life transitions such as adulthood and death.[32]\n\n\nThe spirituality and customs of Torres Strait Islanders, who inhabit the islands between Australia and New Guinea, reflected their Melanesian origins and dependence on the sea.[33]\n\n\n\n### Since British settlement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Christian pastor, Aboriginal activist and former Governor of South Australia, Sir Douglas Nicholls\nEuropean culture and Christianity have had a significant impact on Indigenous Australians. As in many colonial situations the churches both facilitated the loss of Indigenous Australian culture and religion and also facilitated its maintenance. The involvement of Christians in Aboriginal affairs has evolved significantly since 1788. Around the year 2000, many churches and church organisations officially apologised for past failures to adequately respect indigenous cultures and address the injustices of the dispossession of indigenous people.[34][35][36]\n\n\nIn the Torres Strait Islands, the Coming of the Light Festival marks the day the Christian missionaries first arrived on the islands on 1 July 1871 and introduced Christianity to the region. This is a significant festival for Torres Strait Islanders, who are predominantly Christian. Religious and cultural ceremonies are held across Torres Strait and mainland Australia.[37]\n\n\nProminent Aboriginal activist Noel Pearson, himself raised at a Lutheran mission in Cape York, has written that missions throughout Australia's colonial history \"provided a haven from the hell of life on the Australian frontier while at the same time facilitating colonisation\".[38] Prominent Aboriginal Christians have included Pastor David Unaipon, the first Aboriginal author; Pastor Sir Douglas Nicholls, athlete, activist and former Governor of South Australia; Mum (Shirl) Smith, a celebrated Redfern community worker who, assisted by the Sisters of Charity, work to assist Aboriginal peoples.;[39] and former Senator Aden Ridgeway, the first Chairman of the Aboriginal Catholic Ministry.[39] In recent times, Christians such as Fr Ted Kennedy of Redfern,[40] Jesuit human rights lawyer Fr Frank Brennan[41] and the Josephite Sisters have been prominent in working for Aboriginal rights and improvements to standards of living.[42]\n\n\n\n## Abrahamic religions[edit]\n\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Christianity in Australia\n\nAfter the arrival of the first Christian settlers on the First Fleet of British ships in 1788, Christianity quickly became the major religion in Australia. Consequently, the Christian festivals of Christmas and Easter are public holidays, the skylines of Australian cities and towns are marked by church and cathedral spires. Christian churches played a significant role in the development of early education, health and welfare services in Australia.\n\n\nThe churches with the largest number of members are the Catholic Church, the Anglican Church of Australia and the Uniting Church in Australia. The National Council of Churches in Australia has been the main Christian ecumenical body.\n\n\n\n![](image)St. Andrew's Anglican Cathedral in Sydney, New South Wales\nThe Christian churches played an integral role in the development and provision of welfare services in Australia. The first chaplain, Richard Johnson, a Church of England cleric, was charged by Governor Arthur Phillip with improving \"public morality\" in the colony, and he was also heavily involved in health and education.[43]\n\n\nFor much of Australian history, the Church of England in Australia, now known as the Anglican Church of Australia, was the largest religious affiliation. However its relative position has declined, with the Catholic Church, benefiting from post-war Australia multicultural immigration, among other factors, to become the largest single religious group. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia and other congregations associated with non-British cultures have also expanded.\n\n\nToday, the Catholic education system is the second biggest sector after government schools, with more than 750,000 students in 2018 (and around 21 per cent of all secondary school enrolments).[44] The Anglican Church educates around 105,000 students and the Uniting Church has around 48 schools.[45] Smaller denominations, including the Lutheran Church also have a number of schools in Australia. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia also has 8 schools across the country. There are two Catholic universities in Australia: the Australian Catholic University which opened in 1991 following the amalgamation of four Catholic tertiary institutions in eastern Australia, and the University of Notre Dame Australia based in Perth.\n\n\nCatholic Social Services Australia's 63 member organisations help more than a million Australians every year. Anglican organisations work in health, missionary work, social welfare and communications; and the Uniting Church does extensive community work, in aged care, hospitals, nursing, family support services, youth services and with the homeless, and especially throughout inland Australia.[45] Christian charities such as the Saint Vincent de Paul Society, the Salvation Army, Anglicare, and Youth Off the Streets receive considerable national support. Religious orders founded many of Australia's hospitals, such as St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, which was opened as a free hospital in 1857 by the Sisters of Charity and is now Australia's largest not-for-profit health provider and has trained prominent Australian surgeons such as Victor Chang.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mary MacKillop became the first Australian to be canonised as a saint of the Catholic Church in 2010\nNotable Australian Christians[47] have included: Mary MacKillop \u2013 educator, founder of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart and the first Australian to be recognised as a saint by the Catholic Church;[48] David Unaipon \u2013 an Aboriginal writer, inventor and Christian preacher currently featured on the Australian $50 note;[49] Archbishop Daniel Mannix of Melbourne \u2013 a controversial voice against Conscription during World War I and against British policy in Ireland;[50] the Reverend John Flynn \u2013 founder of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, currently featured on the Australian $20 note;[51] Sir Douglas Nicholls \u2013 Aboriginal rights activist, athlete, pastor and former Governor of South Australia;[52] Archbishop Stylianos Harkianakis \u2013 Archbishop and primate of the Greek Orthodox church in Australia from 1975 to 2019\n\n\nSectarianism in Australia tended to reflect the political inheritance of Britain and Ireland. Until 1945, the vast majority of Catholics in Australia were of Irish descent, causing the British majority to question their loyalty to the British Empire. The first Catholic priests arrived in Australia as convicts in 1800, but the Castle Hill Rebellion of 1804 alarmed the British authorities and no further priests were allowed in the colony until 1820, when London sent John Joseph Therry and Philip Connolly.[53] In 1901, the Australian Constitution guaranteed Separation of Church and State. A notable period of sectarianism re-emerged during the First World War and the 1916 Easter Uprising in Ireland,[50] but sectarian division declined after World War II. There was a diversification of Christian churches (especially with the growth of Greek, Macedonian, Serbian and Russian Orthodox churches), together with an increase in ecumenism among Christians through organisations such as the National Council of Churches in Australia,[54] as well as an increase in non-religious adherence.\n\n\n\n![](image)St John's Anglican Church, the oldest church in Australia's capital city, Canberra, was consecrated in 1845\nOne of the most visible signs of the historical importance of Christianity to Australia is the prominence of churches in most Australian towns and cities. Among Australia's oldest are Ebenezer Chapel and the Anglican St Matthew's, Windsor, St Luke's, Liverpool, St Peter's, Campbelltown and St James Church, Sydney, built between 1819 and 1824 by Governor Macquarie's architect, Francis Greenway.[55] St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, was built to a design by William Wardell from a foundation stone laid in 1868; the spires of the cathedral were not finally added until the year 2000. Wardell also worked on the design of St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne \u2013 among the finest examples of ecclesiastical architecture in Australia.[56] The Anglican St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, in the iconic hub of the city opposite Flinders Street station. Adelaide is known as the \"City of Churches\", but churches extend far into the Australian Outback, as at the historic Lutheran Mission Chapel at Hermannsburg, Northern Territory. Along with community attitudes to religion, church architecture changed significantly during the 20th century. Urban churches, such as the Wayside Chapel (1964) in Sydney, differed markedly from traditional ecclesiastical designs. In the later 20th century, distinctly Australian approaches were applied at places such as Jambaroo Benedictine Abbey, where natural materials were chosen to \"harmonise with the local environment\" and the chapel sanctuary is of glass overlooking rainforest.[57] Similar design principles were applied at Thredbo Ecumenical Chapel built in the Snowy Mountains in 1996.[58]\n\n\nThe Christian festivals of Christmas and Easter are national public holidays in Australia. Christmas, which recalls the birth of Jesus Christ, is celebrated on 25 December during the Australian summer (although on 7 January by some Eastern Orthodox) and is an important cultural festival even for many non-religious Australians. The European traditions of Christmas trees, roast dinners, carols and gift giving are all continued in Australia, but they might be conducted between visits to the beach.[59]\n\n\nHere are some Christian denominations with Australian articles:\n\n\n\n* Anglican Church of Australia (formerly the Church of England in Australia)\n* Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia\n* Australian Christian Churches (formerly the Assemblies of God in Australia)\n* Australian Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists\n* Baptist Union of Australia\n* Christian City Churches, started in Australia\n* Churches of Christ in Australia\n* The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Australia\n* Fellowship of Congregational Churches, Australian only\n* Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia\n* CRC Churches International\n* Lutheran Church of Australia\n* Presbyterian Church of Australia\n* Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia\n* Presbyterian Reformed Church (Australia)\n* Catholic Church in Australia\n* Uniting Church in Australia\n* Two by Twos\n\n\nA 2023 IPSOS survey found that 22% of the population was Protestant or Evangelical while 18% was Catholic.[60]\n\n\n\n### Islam[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Islam in Australia\n\n![](image)Grave of Afghan camel driver Zeriph Khan (1871\u20131903) at Bourke Cemetery, New South Wales Australia. Muslims from British India formed some of Australia's earliest Islamic communities.\n![](image)Auburn Gallipoli Mosque was built in the classical Ottoman style by Sydney's Turkish Muslim community.\n![](image)Rugby League player Hazem El Masri is a member of Australia's large Lebanese-Australian Muslim community.\nThe first contacts that Islam had with Australia was when Muslim fishermen native to Makassar, which is today a part of Indonesia, visited North-Western Australia long before British settlement in 1788. This contact of South East Asian ethnic groups of Islamic faith can be identified from the graves they dug for their comrades who died on the journey, being that they face Mecca (in Arabia), in accordance with Islamic regulations concerning burial, as well as evidence from Aboriginal cave paintings and religious ceremonies which depict and incorporate the adoption of Makassan canoe designs and words.[61][62]\n\n\nIn later history, throughout the 19th century following British settlement, other Muslims came to Australia including the Muslim 'Afghan' cameleers, who used their camels to transport goods and people through the otherwise unnavigable desert and pioneered a network of camel tracks that later became roads across the Outback. Australia's first mosque was built for them at Marree, South Australia in 1861.[45] Between the 1860s and 1920s around 2000 cameleers were brought from Afghanistan and the north west of British India (now Pakistan) and perhaps 100 families remained in Australia. Other outback mosques were established at places like Coolgardie, Cloncurry, and Broken Hill \u2013 and more permanent mosques in Adelaide, Perth and later Brisbane. A legacy of this pioneer era is the presence of wild camels in Outback and the oldest Islamic structure in the southern hemisphere, at Central Adelaide Mosque. Nonetheless, despite their significant role in Australia prior to the establishment of rail and road networks, the formulation of the White Australia policy at the time of Federation made immigration difficult for the 'Afghans' and their memory slowly faded during the 20th century, until a revival of interest began in the 1980s.[63]\n\n\nSuccessive Australian governments dismantled the White Australia Policy in the Post-WW2 period. From the 1970s onwards, under the leadership of Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser, Australia began to pursue multiculturalism.[64] Australia in the later 20th century became a refuge for many Muslims fleeing conflicts including those in Lebanon, Bosnia, Iraq, Iran, Sudan and Afghanistan.[65] General immigration, combined with religious conversion to Islam by Christians and other Australians, as well as Australia's participation in UN refugee efforts has increased the overall Muslim population. Around 36% of Muslims are Australian born. Overseas born Muslims come from a great variety of nations and ethnic groups \u2013 with large Lebanese and Turkish communities.\n\n\nFollowing the 11 September attacks in the USA, attempts to associate the ideology/ies of Osama bin Laden and the religion of Islam stirred some debate in some quarters in Australia about Islam's relationship with the wider community. The deaths of Australians in bombings by militant Islamic fundamentalists in New York in 2001, Bali in 2002\u20135 and London in 2005; as well as the sending of Australian troops to East Timor in 1999, Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003; the arrest of bomb plotters in Australia; and concerns about certain cultural practices such as the wearing of the Burkha all contributed to a degree of tension.[66][67] A series of comments by a senior Sydney cleric, Sheikh Taj El-Din Hilaly also stirred controversy, particularly his remarks regarding \"female modesty\" following an incident of gang rape in Sydney.[68][69] Australians were among the targets of Islamic Fundamentalists in the Bali bombings in Indonesia and an attack on the Australian Embassy in Jakarta; and the South East Asian militant group Jemaah Islamiyah has been of particular concern to Australians.[70]\n\n\nThe Australian government's mandatory detention processing system for asylum seekers became increasingly controversial after the 11 September attacks. A significant proportion of recent Asylum seekers arriving by boat have been Muslims fleeing the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere. Some Islamic leaders and social commentators claim that Islam has suffered from unfair stereotyping[71][72][73] Violence and intimidation was directed against Muslims and people of Middle Eastern appearance during southern Sydney's Cronulla riots in 2005. In 2005, the Howard government established the Muslim Community Reference Group to advise on Muslim community issues for one year, chaired by Ameer Ali.[74] Inter-faith dialogues were also established by Christian and Muslim groups such as The Australian Federation of Islamic Councils and the National Council of Churches in Australia.[75] Australia and Indonesia co-operated closely following the Bali-bombings, not only in law-enforcement but in improving education and cross-cultural understanding, leading to a marked improvement in relations.[76] After a series of controversies, Sheikh Taj El-Din Hilaly retired as Grand mufti of Australia in 2007 and was replaced by Fehmi Naji El-Imam AM.[69]\n\n\nToday, over 604,000 people in Australia identify as Muslim, with diverse communities concentrated mainly in Sydney and Melbourne. More than half are non-practising[77] [*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]cultural Muslims. Since the 1970s Islamic schools have been established as well as more than 100 mosques and prayer centres.[45] Many notable Muslim places of worship are to be found in large Australian cities, including the Central Adelaide Mosque, which was constructed during the 1880s; and Sydney's Classical Ottoman style Auburn Gallipoli Mosque, which was largely funded by the Turkish community and the name of which recalls the shared heritage of the foundation of modern Turkey and the story of the ANZACs.[78] 1,140 people identified as Aboriginal Muslims in the 2011 census, almost double the number recorded in the 2001 census.[79][80] Notable Australian Muslims include boxer Anthony Mundine; community worker and rugby league star Hazem El Masri; cricketer Usman Khawaja and academic Waleed Aly. In 2013, Labor MP Ed Husic became Australia's first Muslim member of Cabinet, briefly serving as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and for Broadband in the short lived Second Rudd government.[81]\n\n\n\n### Judaism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Judaism in Australia and History of the Jews in Australia\n\n![](image)The Great Synagogue, Sydney\n![](image)Sir Isaac Isaacs was the first Australian born Governor General of Australia and was the first Jewish vice-regal representative in the British Empire.\nAt least eight Jewish convicts are believed to have been transported to Sydney aboard the First Fleet in 1788, when the first British settlement was established on the continent. An estimated 110,000 Jews currently live in Australia,[82] the majority being Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern European descent, with many being refugees and Holocaust survivors who arrived during and after World War II.\n\n\nThe Jewish population has increased slightly in recent times[83] due to immigration from South Africa and the former Soviet Union. The largest Jewish community in Australia is in Melbourne, with about 60,000, followed by Sydney with about 45,000 members. Smaller communities are dispersed among the other state capitals.\n\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the British colonial period, Jews have enjoyed formal equality before the law in Australia and have not been subject to civil disabilities or other forms of state-sponsored anti-Semitism which exclude them from full participation in public life.\n\n\nSydney's gothic design Great Synagogue, consecrated in 1878, is a notable place of Jewish worship in Australia. Notable Australian Jews have included the Sir John Monash, the notable World War I general who opened the Maccabean Hall in Sydney in 1923 to commemorate Jews who fought and died in the First World War and who is currently featured on the Australian $100 note;[84] and Sir Isaac Isaacs who became the first Australian born governor general in 1930.[20] Sir Zelman Cowen also served as Governor-General, between 1977 and 1982. The Sydney Jewish Museum opened in 1992 to commemorate The Holocaust \"challenge visitors' perceptions of democracy, morality, social justice and human rights\".[85]\n\n\nUntil the 1930s, all synagogues in Australia were nominally Orthodox, with most acknowledging leadership of the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom. To this day the vast majority of synagogues in Australia are Orthodox. However, there is a wide range of Orthodox congregations, including Mizrachi, Chabad and Adass Israel congregations. There are also Sephardi congregations.\n\n\nThere had been short-lived efforts to establish Reform congregations as early as the 1890s. However, under the leadership of Ada Phillips, a sustained liberal congregation, Temple Beth Israel, was established in Melbourne. Subsequently, another synagogue linked to the United States Reform Movement, Temple Emanuel, was established in Sydney. Following these two congregations, a number of other Liberal synagogues have been founded in other cities.[86]\n\n\nSince 1992 Conservative (Masorti) services have been held as an alternative service usually in the Neuweg, the smaller second synagogue within Temple Emanuel, Woollahra, Sydney. In 1999, Kehilat Nitzan, Melbourne's first Conservative (Masorti) congregation was established, with foundation president John Rosenberg. The congregation appointed its first rabbi, Ehud Bandel in 2006. In 2010 Beit Knesset Shalom became Brisbane's first Conservative (Masorti) synagogue.\n\n\nIn 2012, the first humanistic Jewish congregation, known as Kehilat Kolenu, was established in Melbourne with links to the cultural Jewish youth movement Habonim Dror. Later in 2012, a similar congregation was established in Sydney, known as Ayelet HaShachar. The services are loosely based on the Humanistic Jewish movement in the United States and the musical-prayer group Nava Tehila in Israel.\n\n\n\n### Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sydney Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Temple\nMain article: Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in Australia\n\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith first arrived in Australia in 1922, and at less than 0.1% of the total population,[87] is one of the smaller religious minorities. The Sydney Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Temple is situated in Ingleside, a northern suburb of Sydney.[88] According to Jennifer Taylor, a historian at Sydney University, it is among Sydney's four most significant religious buildings constructed in the twentieth century.[89] Dedicated in 1961, it was also the world's fourth Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship to be completed.[88]\n\n\nThe 1996 Australian Census lists Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed membership at just under 9,000.[90] In 2001, the second edition of *A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police and Emergency Services* added the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith to its coverage of religions in Australia and noted that the community had grown to over 11,000.[90] The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on *World Christian Encyclopedia*) estimated some 17,700 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in 2005,[91] and over 19,300 in 2010.[92] However, census data from 2016 reported a much lower population of only 13,988.[87]\n\n\n\n## Indian/Dharmic religions[edit]\n\n\n### Hinduism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hinduism in Australia\n\n![](image)Shiva Vishnu Temple in Melbourne\nHindus numbered 684,000 in the 2021 census, making Hinduism the fourth largest religious or non-religious affiliation. It is one of the fastest growing religions in Australia (12.0% per year since 2011).[2] In the 19th century, Hindus first came to Australia to work on cotton and sugar plantations. Many who remained worked in small business, as camel drivers, merchants and hawkers, selling goods between small rural communities. Their population increased dramatically from the 1960s and 1970s and more than doubled between the 1996 and 2006 census to around 148,000 people. Most were migrants from countries such as Fiji, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore and South Africa. At present many Hindus are well-educated professionals in fields such as medicine, engineering, commerce and information technology. Among Australia's best-known Hindus is the singer Kamahl. There are around forty-three Hindu temples in Australia,[93] the Sri Mandir Temple in Auburn, Sydney being the first established in 1977.[94]\n\n\n\n### Buddhism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Buddhism in Australia\n\n![](image)Nan Tien Temple of Fo Guang Shan Chinese Buddhism, in Wollongong\nBuddhists began arriving in Australia in significant numbers during the goldrush of the 1850s with an influx of Chinese miners. However, the population remained low until the 1960s. Buddhism is now one of the fastest growing religions in Australia. Immigration from Asia has contributed to this, but some people of non-Asian origin have also converted. The three main traditions of Buddhism\u2014Theravada, East Asian and Tibetan\u2014are now represented in Australia.[45] According to the 2021 census, Buddhism has 615,800 adherents: 2.4% of the total population.\n\n\nBuddhist temples can be very active. Quang Minh Temple in Braybrook, Melbourne, Victoria gets about 2,000 people through every Sunday and gives a free vegetarian meal to about 600 people. For important events, more than 20,000 people come. Even more come to the Nan Tien Temple, or \"Southern Paradise Temple\", in Wollongong, New South Wales, began construction in the early 1990s, adopting the Chinese palace building style and is now the largest Buddhist temple in the Southern Hemisphere.[95] This temple follows the Venerable Master Hsing Yun of the Fo Guang Shan Buddhist order. Bodhinyana Monastery is a Theravadin Buddhist monastery in the Thai Forest Tradition located in Serpentine, Western Australia.\n\n\n\n### Sikhism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sri Guru Singh Sabha Gurudwara (Temple), Glenwood, New South Wales\nMain article: Sikhism in Australia\n\nSikhism has been one of the fastest growing religions in Australia in recent years. According to census data, Australia's Sikh population grew from 72,000 to 210,400 between 2011 and 2021, an average growth rate of 14.8% per year.[96] Around 42% of Australia's Sikhs live in the state of Victoria.[97]\n\n\n\n### Jainism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jainism in Australia\n\nJainism is currently the fourth fastest growing religion in Australia, recording 4,050 adherents in 2016 and growing an average of 7.7% per year. The overwhelming majority (94.7%) of Jains live inside the state capitals, primarily Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.[98]\n\n\n\n## Irreligion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Irreligion in Australia\n\n### Non-religious[edit]\n\n\nAustralia is one of the least religious nations in the developed world, with religion not described as a central part in many people's lives.[99] This view is prominent among Australia's youth, who were ranked as the least religious worldwide in a 2008 survey conducted by *The Christian Science Monitor*.[100] In the 2021 census, the ABS categorised ~9,887,000 Australians (38.9%) as having no religion, up 16.6% in real terms from 4,796,800 (22.3%) in 2011.[22] This category includes agnosticism, atheism, humanism, rationalism, and people who are unaffiliated with any particular religion.\n\n\n\n### Atheism[edit]\n\n\nWhile people with no religion are more than 30% of the Australian population,[22] the Australian Bureau of Statistics does not provide information in the annual \"1301.0 \u2013 Year Book Australia\" on religious affiliation as to how many people fall into each sub-category.[101] Data on religious affiliation is only collected by the ABS at the five yearly population census. Atheist interests in Australia are represented[*how?*] nationally by the Atheist Foundation of Australia.[*citation needed*] Humanist interests in Australia are represented[*how?*] nationally by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies.[*citation needed*] Rationalist interests in Australia are represented[*how?*] nationally by the Rationalist Society of Australia.[*citation needed*] The Global Atheist Convention, a prominent atheist event, has been held in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n## Other religions[edit]\n\n\nThe 2006 census[102] shows 53 listed groups down to 5000 members, most of them Christian denominations, many of them national versions such as Greek, Serbian Orthodox and Assyrian Orthodox. Of the smaller religions, Pagan religions 29,328, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith at 12,000, Humanism about 7000. Between 1000 and 5000 are: Taoism, Druse, Satanism, Zoroastrian, Rationalism, Creativity, Theosophy, Jainism. There are also adherents of Tenrikyo, Shinto, Unitarian Universalism, Eckankar, Cao Dai, Rastafari, Pantheism, Scientology and Raelianism.[103][104]\n\n\nIn general, non-Christian religions and those with no religion have been growing in proportion to the overall population.[105] With fewer classifications, data from 1996 and 2001 showed Aboriginal religion decreasing from 7000 to 5000 while Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed grew from just under 9,000 to over 11,000 and the rest of the \"Other\" category growing from about 69,000 to about 92,000.[90]\n\n\n\n### Paganism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Paganism in Australia\n\nAlexandrian Wiccans and Gardnerian Wiccans arrived in Australia from England and the United States around the late 1960s.[106]\n\n\nIn the 2011 census, 32,083 Australians identified their religion as a Pagan religion including 8,413 people who identified their religion as Wicca or Neopagan witchcraft.[107]\n\n\n\n## Religion and the law[edit]\n\n\n### Constitutional status[edit]\n\n\nSection 116 of the Constitution of Australia provides that:\n\n\n\n\n> The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.\n> \n> \n\n\nTechnically, this does not affect the states' authority to legislate on religion. Nor would it block federal legislation on religion, aside from that establishing an official religion of Australia. In practice, though, federal governments have respected Section 116 and generally allowed the free practice of religions. Australia does not have explicit \"separation of church and state\"\u2014the essence of a \"secular state\"\u2014in the sense that countries like the USA do. In view of Section 116 of Australia's constitution (\"The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance ...\"), it is commonly believed that Australia is already a \"secular state\". This is a misconception: in 1981, the High Court determined that there is in fact no constitutional separation of church and state in Australia. However, there is no general \"mood\" to legislate establishment of religions.[108]\n\n\n\n### Other interactions[edit]\n\n\nIn 1983, the High Court of Australia defined religion as \"a complex of beliefs and practices which point to a set of values and an understanding of the meaning of existence\". The *Australian Bureau of Statistics 2001 Census Dictionary* defines \"no religion\" as a category of religion which includes subcategories such as agnosticism, atheism, Humanism and rationalism (but the ABS also categorises these as \"secular beliefs\").\n\n\nThe Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) is able to inquire into allegations of discrimination on religious grounds.\n\n\nIn 1998 the HREOC addressed the right to freedom of religion and belief in Australia against article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, stating that \"despite the legal protections that apply in different jurisdictions, many Australians suffer discrimination on the basis of religious belief or non-belief, including members of both mainstream and non-mainstream religions, and those of no religious persuasion.\"[109] An example of an HREOC response to such views is the IsmaU project, which examines possible prejudice against Muslims in Australia since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US and the Bali bombings.[110]\n\n\n\n## Interfaith efforts[edit]\n\n\nInterfaith efforts between various religious institutions occur. Since the early 2000s, the Abraham Conference convenes as an annual interfaith event between Christians, Muslims, and Jews.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Australia portal\n* ![icon](image)Religion portal\n\n\n* *A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police and Emergency Services*\n* Australian Association for Jewish Studies\n* Broken Rites & Catholic Church sexual abuse cases in Australia\n* Freedom of religion in Australia\n* National Church Life Survey\n* Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse\n* Separation of church and state in Australia\n* Stolen Generations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Australian Bureau of Statistics\u00a0: 2021 Census of Population and Housing\u00a0: General Community Profile\" (XLSX). *Abs.gov.au*.

Throughout India's history, religion has been an important part of the country's culture and the Indian subcontinent is the birthplace of four of the world's major religions, namely, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism, which are collectively known as native Indian Religions or Dharmic Religions which along with the tribal faiths form more than 83% of the total population in India.\n\n\nThe Preamble to the Constitution of India states that India is a secular state,[2][3] and the Constitution of India has declared the right to freedom of religion to be a fundamental right.[4]\n\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 79.8% of the population of India practices Hinduism, 14.2% adheres to Islam, 2.3% adheres to Christianity, 1.7% adheres to Sikhism, 0.7% adheres to Buddhism and 0.4% adheres to Jainism. Zoroastrianism, Sanamahism and Judaism also have an ancient history in India, and each has several thousands of Indian adherents. India has the largest population of people adhering to both Zoroastrianism (i.e. Parsis and Iranis) and the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in the world;[5] these religions are otherwise largely exclusive to their native Persia where they originated from.\n\n\n\n\n## Secularism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Secularism in India and Freedom of religion in India\n\n![](image)Preamble of the Indian Constitution\nThe Constitution of India, declares India to be a secular state with no state religion.[6] The Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India enacted in 1976 asserts the Preamble to the Constitution of India as secular.[7] It was enacted by Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed who was pressured by Indira Gandhi, during the leadup to the Emergency.[*citation needed*] However, the Supreme Court of India in the 1994 case *S. R. Bommai v. Union of India* established that India had been secular since the formation of the Republic on 26 January 1950.[8] Secularism in India is understood to mean not a separation of religion from state, but a state that supports or participates in a neutral manner in the affairs of all religious groups and as well as atheism.[9]\n\n\nHowever, the original copy of Indian constitution has an illustration of Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana in Part III on Fundamental Rights and Rama has been considered as the true guardian of people's rights.[10] Article 48 of the Indian constitution prohibits the slaughter of cows or calves (a sacred animal in Hinduism) and the same is a criminal offense in most states of India.[11][12]\n\n\nSecularism is defined as a basic structure doctrine of the constitution through the argument of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case, that cannot be removed or amended by any means.[13] However, there is no mention of the term \u201cBasic Structure\u201d anywhere in the Constitution of India. The idea that the Parliament cannot introduce laws that would amend the basic structure of the constitution have been evolved judicially over time and many cases.[14]\n\n\nThe particular provisions regarding secularism and freedom of religion in India in the constitution are:\n\n\n\n* Article 14: grants equality before the law and equal protection of the laws to all.[15]\n* Article 15: enlarges the concept of secularism to the widest possible extent by prohibiting discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.[16]\n* Article 25: Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of any religion.[17]\n* Article 26: Freedom to manage religious affairs.[18]\n* Article 27: Freedom as to payment of taxes for promotion of any particular religion.[19]\n* Article 28: Freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in certain educational institutions.[20]\n* Articles 29 and 30: provide cultural and educational rights to the minorities.[21][22]\n* Article 51A: i.e. Fundamental Duties obliges all the citizens to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood and to value and preserve the heritage of the country's composite diverse culture.[23]\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian religions\n\nSee also: Religious thinkers of India and Indian philosophy\n\n### Prehistoric religion[edit]\n\n\nEvidence attesting to prehistoric religion in the Indian \"subcontinent\" derives from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings depicting dances and rituals.[24] Neolithic pastoralists inhabiting the Indus Valley buried their dead in a manner suggestive of spiritual practices that incorporated notions of an afterlife.[25] Other South Asian Stone Age sites, such as the Bhimbetka rock shelters in central Madhya Pradesh and the Kupgal petroglyphs of eastern Karnataka, contain rock art portraying religious rites and evidence of possible ritualised music.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Pashupati seal, discovered at the Indus Valley Civilization city of Mohenjo-daro, identified with the Hindu god Shiva\n### Indus Valley Civilization[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indus Valley Civilisation\n\nThe Harappan people of the Indus Valley Civilisation, which lasted from 3300 to 1400 BCE and was centered on the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra river valleys, may have worshiped an important mother goddess symbolising fertility.[27] Excavations of Indus Valley Civilisation sites show seals with animals and \"fire\u2011altars\", indicating rituals associated with fire.[28] A *Shivlinga* of a type similar to that which is now worshiped by Hindus has also been found,[27] however this interpretation has been disputed by Srinivasan [29]\n\n\n\n### Evolution of Hinduism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Hinduism\n\nHinduism is often regarded as the oldest religion in the world,[30] with roots tracing back to prehistoric times, over 5,000 years ago.[31] Hinduism spread through parts of Southeastern Asia, China, and Afghanistan. Hindus worship a single divine entity (paramatma, lit.\"first-soul\") with different forms.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)An early 19th century manuscript of the Rigveda written in Devanagari\nHinduism's origins include the cultural elements of the Indus Valley Civilisation along with other Indian civilisations.[33] The oldest surviving text of Hinduism is the Rigveda, produced during the Vedic period and dating to 1700\u20131100 BCE.[\u03b3][34] During the Epic and Puranic periods, the earliest versions of the epic poems, in their current form including *Ramayana* and *Mahabharata* were written roughly from 500 to 100 BCE,[35] although these were orally transmitted through families for centuries prior to this period.[36]\n\n\nAfter 200 BCE, several schools of thought were formally codified in the Indian philosophy, including Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Purva-Mimamsa, and Vedanta.[37] Hinduism, otherwise a highly theistic religion, hosted atheistic schools and atheistic philosophies. Other Indian philosophies generally regarded as orthodox include Samkhya and Mimamsa.[38]\n\n\n\n### Rise of Shramana Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Jainism in India and History of Buddhism in India\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **may need to be rewritten** to comply with Wikipedia's quality standards.

Ashoka is credited with promoting the spread of Buddhism in India and throughout Asia\n\nThe \u015arama\u1e47a tradition includes Jainism,[39] known endonymically as *Jain Dharm*, and Buddhism[40] known endonymically as *Bauddh Dharm*, and others such as the \u0100j\u012bvikas, Aj\u00f1anas, and others.[41][42]\n\n\nThe historical roots of Jainism in India have been traced to the 9th century BCE with the rise of Parshvanatha, the 23rd Tirthankar, and his Jain philosophy,[43][39] and to Mahavira (599\u2013527 BCE), the 24th Jain Tirthankara. Jainism traces its roots further back to the first Tirthankara, Rishabhanatha. Mahavira stressed on the five vows.\n\n\nGautama Buddha, who founded Buddhism, was born to the Shakya clan just before Magadha (which lasted from 546 to 324 BCE) rose to power.[*citation needed*] His family was native to the plains of Lumbini, in what is now southern Nepal. Indian Buddhism peaked during the reign of Ashoka the Great of the Mauryan Empire, who patronised Buddhism following his conversion and unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE.[44] He sent missionaries abroad, allowing Buddhism to spread across Asia.[45] Indian Buddhism declined following the loss of royal patronage offered by the Kushan Empire and such kingdoms as Magadha and Kosala.\n\n\nThe decline of Buddhism in India has been attributed to a variety of factors, which include the resurgence of Hinduism in the 10th and 11th centuries under Sankaracharya, the later Turkish invasion, the Buddhist focus on renunciation as opposed to familial values and private property, Hinduism's own use and appropriation of Buddhist and Jain ideals of renunciation and ahimsa, and others. Although Buddhism virtually disappeared from mainstream India by the 11th century CE, its presence remained and manifested itself through other movements such as the Bhakti tradition, Vaishnavism, and the Bauls of Bengal, who are influenced by the Sahajjyana form of Buddhism that was popular in Bengal during the Pala period.\n\n\n\n### Bhakti Movement[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The Bhakti movement actually started in the eighth century in south India (present-day Tamil Nadu and Kerala), and gradually spread northwards.[46] It was initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or saints. Dnyaneshwar, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallabhacharya, Surdas, Meera Bai, Kabir, Tulsidas, Ravidas, Namdeo, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram, and other mystics were some of the saints in the North. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by an abundance of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces. The Bhakti movement gave rise to several different movements throughout India\n\n\nDuring the Bhakti movement, many Hindu groups regarded as outside the traditional Hindu caste system followed Bhakti traditions by worshipping/following saints belonging to their respective communities. For example, Guru Ravidas was a Chamar of Uttar Pradesh; Guru Parsuram Ramnami was a Chura[*dubious \u2013 discuss*] of Chhattisgarh, and Maharishi Ram Naval was a Bhangi of Rajasthan. In their lifetimes, several of these saints even went to the extent of fighting conversion from foreign missionaries, encouraging only Hinduism within their communities. In Assam for example, tribals were led by Gurudev Kalicharan Bramha of the Brahmo Samaj; in Nagaland by Kacha Naga; and in Central India by Birsa Munda, Hanuman Aaron, Jatra Bhagat, and Budhu Bhagat.\n\n\n\n#### Kabir Sect[edit]\n\n\nThe Kabir Panth is a religious movement based on the teachings of the Indian poet saint Kabir (1398\u20131518).[47]\n\n\nKabir sermonized a monotheism that appealed clearly to the poor and convinced them of their access to god with no liaison. He denied both Hinduism and Islam, as well as meaningless religious rituals, and condemned double standards.[48] This infuriated the orthodox aristocracy. No one could frighten Kabir who was bold enough to stand up for himself and his beliefs.[49]\n\n\nThe Kabir Panth considers Kabir as its principal guru or even as a divinity\u2014truth incarnate. Kabir's influence is testimony to his massive authority, even for those whose beliefs and practices he condemned so unsparingly. For Sikhs he is a forerunner and converser of Nanak, the originating Sikh Guru (spiritual guide). Muslims place him in Sufi (mystical) lineages, and for Hindus he becomes a Vaishnavite with universalist leanings.[50]\n\n\n\n### Sikhism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sikhism in India\n\n![](image)Sikh pilgrims at the causeway to the sanctum of the Harmandir Sahib, the holiest Sikh Gurdwara\nGuru Nanak Dev Ji (1469\u20131539) was the founder of Sikhism, known endonymically as *Sikh Dharm*.[51][52] The Guru Granth Sahib was first compiled by the fifth Sikh guru, Guru Arjan Dev, from the writings of the first five Sikh gurus and others saints who preached the concept of universal brotherhood, including those of the Hindu and Muslim faith. Before the death of Guru Gobind Singh, the Guru Granth Sahib was declared the eternal guru.[53] Sikhism recognises all humans as equal before Waheguru,[54] regardless of colour, caste, or lineage.[55] Sikhism strongly rejects the beliefs of fasting (vrata), superstitions, idol worship,[56][57] and circumcision.[58][59] The Sikhs believe in one eternal god and follow the teachings of the 10 gurus, the 5 K's of Sikhism, the hukums of Guru Gobind Singh, Sikh Rehat Maryada, and Nitnem.\n\n\n\n### Introduction of Abrahamic religions[edit]\n\n\n#### Judaism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Jews in India\n\n![](image)Jewish family from Malabar, 1540\nJews first arrived as traders from Judea in the city of Kochi, Kerala, in 562 BCE.[60] More Jews came as exiles from Israel in the year 70 CE, after the destruction of the Second Temple.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Christianity in India\n\n![](image)A procession during the Feast of St. Sebastian at St. Mary's Forane Church, Athirampuzha, Kerala\nChristianity was introduced to India by Thomas the Apostle (a direct disciple of Jesus Christ),[62] who visited Muziris in Kerala in 52 CE and proselytized natives at large, who are known as Saint Thomas Christians (also known as Syrian Christians or Nasrani) today. India's oldest church, the world's oldest existing church structure and built by Thomas the Apostle in 57 CE, called Thiruvithamcode Arappally or *Thomaiyar* *Kovil* as named by the then Chera king Udayancheral, is located at Thiruvithamcode in Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu, India. It is now declared an international St. Thomas pilgrim center.[63] There is a general scholarly consensus that Christianity was rooted in India by the 6th century CE, including some communities who used Syriac liturgically, and it is a possibility that the religion's existence in India extends to as far back as the 1st century.[64][65][66] Christianity in India has different denominations like Syrian Orthodox, Catholicism, Protestantism, Oriental Orthodox and others.\n\n\nMost Christians reside in South India, particularly in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Goa.[67][68] There are also large Christian populations in Northeast India.[69]\nChristianity in India was expanded in the 16th century by Catholic Portuguese expeditions and by Protestant missionaries in the 18th and 19th centuries.[70]\n\n\n\n#### Islam[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Islam in India\n\n![](image)Girls chase doves in front of the Jama Masjid in Delhi. The mosque is one of the largest in India.\nIslam is the second largest religion in India, with 14.2% of the country's population or roughly 172 million people identifying as adherents of Islam (2011 census).[71][72][73][74][75][76] It makes India the country with the largest Muslim population outside Muslim-majority countries.[77]\n\n\nThough Islam came to India in the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders in Malabar coast, Kerala, it started to become a major religion during the Muslim rule in the Indian subcontinent.[78] The Cheraman Juma Mosque is the first mosque in India located in Methala, Kodungallur Taluk, Thrissur District in Kerala.[79] A legend claims that it was built in 629 CE, which makes it the oldest mosque in the Indian subcontinent which is still in use.[79] It was built by Malik Deenar, Persian companion of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, on the orders of the successor of Cheraman Perumal, the Chera King of modern-day Kerala.[80] Islam's spread in India mostly took place under the Delhi Sultanate (1206\u20131526) and the Mughal Empire (1526\u20131858), greatly aided by the mystic Sufi tradition.[81]\n\n\n\n## Census statistics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hinduism in India, Islam in India, Christianity in India, History of Buddhism in India, Sikhism in India, Jainism in India, History of the Jews in India, Parsis, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in India, Tribal religions in India, and Irreligion in India\n\n![](image)Map of majority religious groups by region in India.

Hindu reformist Sects such as the Arya samaj do not use the term Sanatani.\n\n\n\n### Islam[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Islam in India\n\n![](image)Jama Masjid, Delhi\nIslam is a monotheistic religion centered on the belief in one God and following the example of Muhammad; it is the largest minority religion in India. About 14.2% of the country's population or approx. 172.2 million people identify as adherents of Islam (2011 census).[82][99][100][101] It makes India the country with the largest Muslim population outside Muslim-majority countries. Muslims are a majority in states Jammu and Kashmir and Lakshadweep,[102] and live in high concentrations in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and Kerala.[102][103] There has been no particular census conducted in India with regards to sects, but sources suggest the largest denomination is Sunni Islam[104] with a substantial minority of Shia Muslims and Ahmadiyya Muslims. Indian sources like Times of India and DNA reported the Indian Shiite population in mid-2005\u20132006 to be between 25% and 31% of entire Muslim population of India, which accounts them in numbers between 40 and 50 million.[105][106][104][107]\n\n\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Christianity in India\n\n![](image)The Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health of Velankanni, in Tamil Nadu, is a very devoted Catholic Marian shrine.\nChristianity is a monotheistic religion centred on the life and teachings of Jesus as presented in the New Testament. It is the third largest religion of India, making up 2.3% of the population. St. Thomas is credited with introduction of Christianity in India. He arrived on the Malabar Coast in 52 CE.[108][109][110] \nThe tradition of origin among Saint Thomas Christians relates to the arrival of Saint Thomas, one of the 12 disciples of Jesus at the ancient seaport Muziris on the Kerala coast in 52 CE. The families Sankaramangalam, Pakalomattam, Kalli, and Kaliyankal were considered particularly preeminent, and historically the most aristocratic Syriac Christian families tended to claim descent from these families.\n\n\nIt is also possible for Aramaic-speaking Jews from Galilee to make a trip to Kerala in the 1st century. The Cochin Jews are known to have existed in Kerala around that time. The earliest known source connecting the apostle to India is the Acts of Thomas, likely written in the early 3rd century, perhaps in Edessa.\n\n\nMarth Mariam Syro-Malabar Catholic Forane Church, Arakuzha was founded in 999\n\n\nThe text describes Thomas' adventures in bringing Christianity to India, a tradition later expanded upon in early Indian sources such as the \"Thomma Parvam\" (\"Song of Thomas\"). Generally he is described as arriving in or around Maliankara and founding Seven Churches and half churches, or Ezharapallikal: Kodungallur, Kollam, Niranam, Nilackal (Chayal), Kokkamangalam, Kottakkavu, Palayoor, Thiruvithamcode Arappalli and Aruvithura church (half church). A number of 3rd- and 4th-century Roman writers also mention Thomas' trip to India, including Ambrose of Milan, Gregory of Nazianzus, Jerome, and Ephrem the Syrian, while Eusebius of Caesarea records that his teacher Pantaenus visited a Christian community in India in the 2nd century. There came into existence a Christian community who were mainly merchants.\n\n\nChristianity expanded in the rest of India during the period of British colonial rule. Christians comprise the majority of natives of Nagaland and Mizoram as well as of Meghalaya and have significant populations in Manipur, Goa, Kerala and Mumbai.\n\n\n\n### Sikhism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sikhism in India\n\n![](image)Shree Hari Mandir Sahib (Golden Temple)\nSikhism is a monotheistic religion began in fifteenth-century Punjab with the teachings of Guru Nanak and nine successive Sikh gurus. As of 2011, there were 20.8 million Sikhs in India. Punjab is the spiritual home of Sikhs, and is the only state in India where Sikhs form a majority. There are also significant populations of Sikhs in neighboring Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu division of Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, and Haryana. These areas were historically a part of Greater Punjab. However, there is no data for specific number of Nanak followers (Nanakpanthis) in India, but they are believed to be in crores somewhere around 14 crores.[111][112][113] Karnail Singh Panjoli, member, Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, says that there are several communities within the term \u2018Nanakpanthis\u2019 too. \u201cThere are groups like Sikhligarh, Vanjaarey, Nirmaley, Lubaney, Johri, Satnamiye, Udaasiyas etc. who call themselves Nanakpanthis. They follow guru Nanak and Sri Guru Granth Sahib.[114][115]\n\n\n\n### Buddhism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Buddhism in India\n\n![](image)Mahabodhi temple\nBuddhism is an Indian, transtheistic religion and philosophy. Around 8.5 million Buddhists live in India, about 0.7% of the total population.[116] Buddhism as a religion is practised mainly in the foothills of the Himalayas and is a significant religion in Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Darjeeling in West Bengal, and the Lahaul and Spiti districts of Himachal Pradesh. Besides, a significant number of Buddhists reside in Maharashtra. They are the Buddhists or Navayana Buddhists who, under the influence of B. R. Ambedkar embraced Buddhism in order to escape the casteist practices within Hinduism. Ambedkar is a crucial figure, along with Anagarika Dharmapala of Sri Lanka and Kripasaran Mahasthavira of Chittagong behind the revival of Buddhism in India in the 19th and 20th centuries. The escape of the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzing Gyatso to India fleeing Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1959 and the setting up of the Tibetan Government in Exile at Dharamshala in Mcleodganj in Himachal Pradesh has also accelerated the resurgence of Buddhism in India. The effective religion in Sikkim, which joined the Indian Union in 1975 (making it India's 22nd state) remains Vajrayana Buddhism, and Padmasambhava or Guru Ugyen is a revered presence there.\n\n\n\n### Jainism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jainism in India\n\n![](image)Ranakpur Jain temple\nJainism is a non-theistic Indian religion and philosophical system originating in Iron Age India. Jains compose 0.4% (around 4.45 million) of India's population, and are concentrated in the states of Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan.[102]\n\n\n\n### Judaism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Jews in India\n\n![](image)The interior of the Paradesi Synagogue in Cochin.\nAlso present in India, Judaism is a monotheistic religion from the Levant. There is today a very small community of Indian Jews. There were more Jews in India historically, including the Cochin Jews of Kerala, the Bene Israel of Maharashtra, and the Baghdadi Jews near Mumbai. Since Indian independence, two primarily proselyte Indian Jewish communities have developed in India: the Bnei Menashe of Mizoram and Manipur, and the Bene Ephraim, also called *Telugu Jews*. Of the approximately 95,000 Jews of Indian extraction, fewer than 20,000 remain in India. Some parts of India are especially popular with Israelis, swelling local Jewish populations seasonally.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Other religions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith's Lotus Temple in Delhi, India\nAs of the census of 2001, Parsis (followers of Zoroastrianism in India) represent approximately 0.006% of the total population of India,[117] with relatively high concentrations in and around the city of Mumbai. Parsis number around 61,000 in India.[118]\n\n\nThere are several tribal religions in India, such as Donyi-Polo. Santhal is also one of the many tribal religions followed by the Santhal people who number around 4 million but only around 23,645 follow the religion.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIt is difficult to establish the exact numbers of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in India. The religion came to India from Iran in about 1850 and gained some converts from the Muslim population of India. The first Sikh and Hindu converts came by 1910, and in 1960 there were fewer than 1,000 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in all of India. Beginning in 1961, large numbers from scheduled castes became Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, and by 1993 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds reported about 2.2 million members,[5] though later sources have claimed 2 million,[119] or \"more than 1 million\".[120]\n\n\n\n### Atheism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Irreligion in India\n\nAround 2.9 million people in India did not state their religion in the 2001 census and were counted in the category, \"religion not stated\". They were 0.24% of India's population. Their number have significantly increased 4 times from 0.7 million in 2001 census at an average annual rate of 15%.[121] K. Veeramani, a Dravidar Kazhagam leader, said that he believed that the number of atheists in India was actually higher as many people don't reveal their atheism out of fear.[122]\n\n\nAccording to the 2012 WIN-Gallup Global Index of Religion and Atheism report, 81% of Indians were religious, 13% were non-religious, 3% were convinced atheists, and 3% were unsure or did not respond.[123]\n\n\n\n## Law[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Constitution of India; Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India; Secularism in India; and Indian religion \u00a7\u00a0Status in the Republic of India\n\nSee also: Jain law\n\nThe preamble to the Constitution of India proclaims India a \"sovereign socialist secular democratic republic\". The word *secular* was inserted into the Preamble by the Forty-second Amendment Act of 1976. It mandates equal treatment and tolerance of all religions. India does not have an official state religion; it enshrines the right to practice, preach, and propagate any religion. No religious instruction is imparted in government-supported schools. In S. R. Bommai v. Union of India, the Supreme Court of India held that secularism was an integral tenet of the Constitution and that there was separation of state and religion.[124]\n\n\nFreedom of religion is a fundamental right according to the Indian Constitution. The Constitution also suggests a uniform civil code for its citizens as a Directive Principle.[125] This has not been implemented until now as Directive Principles are Constitutionally unenforceable. The Supreme Court has further held that the enactment of a uniform civil code all at once may be counter-productive to the unity of the nation, and only a gradual progressive change should be brought about (*Pannalal Bansilal v State of Andhra Pradesh, 1996*).[126] In *Maharishi Avadesh v Union of India (1994)* the Supreme Court dismissed a petition seeking a writ of mandamus against the government to introduce a common civil code, and thus laid the responsibility of its introduction on the legislature.[127]\n\n\nMajor religious communities not based in India continue to be governed by their own personal laws. Whilst Muslims, Christians, Zoroastrians, and Jews have personal laws exclusive to themselves; Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs are governed by a single personal law known as Hindu personal law. Article 25 (2)(b) of the Constitution of India states that references to Hindus include \"persons professing the Sikh, Jain, or Buddhist religion\".[128] Furthermore, the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 defines the legal status of Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs as legal Hindus but not \"Hindus by religion\".[129] Supreme Court in 2005 gave verdict that Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhist are part of broader Hindu fold, as they are Indic religions and interconnected to each other, though they are distinct religions.[130]\n\n\n\n## Aspects[edit]\n\n\nReligion plays a major role in the Indian way of life.[131] Rituals, worship, and other religious activities are very prominent in an individual's daily life; it is also a principal organizer of social life. The degree of religiosity varies amongst individuals; in recent decades, religious orthodoxy and observances have become less common in Indian society, particularly amongst young urban-dwellers.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Rituals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A *puja* performed on the banks of the overflowing Shipra River in Ujjain during the summer monsoon.The vast majority of Indians engage in religious rituals daily.[132] Most Hindus observe religious rituals at home.[133] Observation of rituals vary greatly amongst regions, villages, and individuals. Devout Hindus perform daily chores such as worshiping puja, fire sacrifice called Yajna[*citation needed*] at the dawn after bathing (usually at a family shrine, and typically includes lighting a lamp and offering foods before the images of deities), recitation from religious scripts like Vedas, and Puranas singing hymns in praise of gods.[133]\n\n\nA notable feature in religious ritual is the division between purity and pollution. Religious acts presuppose some degree of impurity, or defilement for the practitioner, which must be overcome or neutralized, before or during ritual procedures. Purification, usually with water, is thus a typical feature of most religious action.[133] Other characteristics include a belief in the efficacy of sacrifice and concept of merit, gained through the performance of charity or good works, that will accumulate over time and reduce sufferings in the next world.[133]\n\n\nMuslims offer five daily prayers at specific times of the day, indicated by *adhan* (call to prayer) from the local mosques. Before offering prayers, they must ritually clean themselves by performing *wudu*, which involves washing parts of the body that are generally exposed to dirt or dust. A recent study by the Sachar Committee found that 3\u20134% of Muslim children study in *madrasas* (Islamic schools).[134]\n\n\n\n### Diet[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A vegetarian thali from Rajasthan.\nSee also: Vegetarianism and religion and Fasting\n\nDietary habits in India are significantly influenced by religion. According to a survey, 31% of Indian population claims to be vegetarian, and mainly practice lacto-vegetarianism.[135][136][137] Vegetarianism is less common among Sikhs, Muslims, Christians, Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, Parsis, and Jews.Despite the majority of population having no objection to meat consumption, globally India has the lowest meat consumption per capita.[138] Non-vegetarian Indians mostly prefer poultry, fish, other seafood, goat, and sheep as their sources of meat.[139] Hinduism forbids beef whilst islam forbids pork. The smaller populations of christians, tribals, and some dalit communities have no objection to eating either beef or pork.[140] \nJainism requires followers, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian. Furthermore, the religion also forbids \nJains from eating any vegetable that involves digging it from the ground. This rule, therefore, excludes all Root vegetables such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, ginger, carrots, garlic, radishes, etc. from a Jain diet.\n\n\n\n### Ceremonies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Hindu wedding ceremony.\nOccasions like birth, marriage, and death involve what are often elaborate sets of religious customs. In Hinduism, major life-cycle rituals include *annaprashan* (a baby's first intake of solid food), *upanayanam* (\"sacred thread ceremony\" undergone by boys belonging to some upper-castes such as Brahmin and Kshatriya only), and *shraadh* (paying homage to a deceased individual).[141][142] According to the findings of a 1995 national research paper, for most people in India, a betrothal of a young couple placing an expectation upon an exact date and time of a future wedding was a matter decided by the parents in consultation with astrologers.[141] A significant reduction in the proportion of arranged marriages has however taken place since 1995, reflecting an incremental change.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMuslims practice a series of life-cycle rituals that differ from those of Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists.[143] Several rituals mark the first days of life\u2014including the whispering call to prayer, first bath, and shaving of the head. Religious instruction begins early. Male circumcision usually takes place after birth; in some families, it may be delayed until after the onset of puberty.[143]\n\n\nMarriage requires a payment by the husband to the wife, called Meher, and the solemnization of a marital contract in a social gathering.[143] After the burial of the dead, friends and relatives gather to console the bereaved, read and recite the Quran, and pray for the soul of the deceased.[143] Indian Islam is distinguished by the emphasis it places on shrines commemorating great Sufi saints.[143]\n\n\n\n### Pilgrimages[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hindu pilgrimage sites in India and Buddhist pilgrimage sites in India\n\n* ![The largest religious gathering ever held on Earth, 2019 Prayag Kumbh Mela held in Allahabad (officially known as Prayagraj) attracted around 120 million people from around the world.](image)\n\nThe largest religious gathering ever held on Earth, 2019 Prayag Kumbh Mela held in Allahabad (officially known as Prayagraj) attracted around 120 million people from around the world.\n* ![Mahamagam Festival is a holy festival celebrated once in twelve years in Tamil Nadu.

Hindus worldwide recognise several Indian holy cities, including Allahabad (officially known as Prayagraj), Haridwar, Varanasi, Ujjain, Rameshwaram, and Vrindavan. Notable temple cities include Puri, which hosts a major Jagannath temple and Rath Yatra celebration; Tirumala - Tirupati, home to the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple; and Katra, home to the Vaishno Devi temple.\n\n\nBadrinath, Puri, Dwarka, and Rameswaram compose the main pilgrimage circuit of *Char Dham* (*four abodes*) hosting the four holiest Hindu temples: Badrinath Temple, Jagannath Temple, Dwarkadheesh Temple and Ramanathaswamy Temple, respectively. The Himalayan towns of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri compose the smaller *Chota Char Dham* (*mini four abodes*) pilgrimage circuit. The Kumbh Mela (the \"pitcher festival\") is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every four years; the location is rotated amongst Allahabad (Prayagraj), Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain. The Thalaimaippathi at Swamithope is the leading pilgrim center for the Ayyavazhis.\n\n\nSeven of the Eight Great Places of Buddhism are in India. Bodh Gaya, Sarnath, and Kushinagar are the places where important events in the life of Gautama Buddha took place. Sanchi hosts a Buddhist stupa erected by the emperor Ashoka. Many Buddhist monasteries dot the Himalayan foothills of India, where Buddhism remains a major presence. These include the Rumtek Monastery, Enchey Monastery, and Pemayangtse Monastery in Sikkim, the Tawang Monastery in Arunachal Pradesh, the Kye Monastery and Tabo Monastery in Spiti, the Ghum Monastery in Darjeeling, and Durpin Dara Monastery in Kalimpong, the Thikse Monastery in Leh, the Namgyal Monastery in Dharamshala, among many others.\n\n\nFor Sunni Muslims, the *Dargah Shareef* of Khwaza Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer is a major pilgrimage site.[151] Other Islamic pilgrimages include those to the Tomb of Sheikh Salim Chishti in Fatehpur Sikri, Jama Masjid in Delhi, and to Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai. Dilwara Temples in Mount Abu, Palitana, Pavapuri, Girnar, and Shravanabelagola are notable pilgrimage sites (tirtha) in Jainism.\n\n\nThe Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar is the most sacred gurdwara of Sikhism.[152]\n\n\nRelatively new pilgrimage sites include the samadhi of Meher Baba in Meherabad, which is visited by his followers from around the world[153] and the Saibaba temple in Shirdi.\n[154]\n\n\n\n### Minority beliefs and sects[edit]\n\n\nHinduism contains many different sub-cultures just like most other religions. The major aspects outlined above hold true for the majority of the Hindu population, but not all. Just as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the *Prajapatis* for example, holds water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times.[155] This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.\n\n\nOther minor sects in India carry no specific name, but they are uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than in North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and doing other intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition was derived from the concept of Rahukaalam, in which Hindus believe that a specific period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have led to the development of a more constrained religious hierarchy.[156] Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying awake for long periods after sunset. Examples of families which follow this tradition include *Gudivada*, *Padalapalli*, *Pantham*, and *Kashyap*.[155]\n\n\n\n## Religiosity[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Irreligion in India\n\nReligiosity among Indians (2012 Survey)[123]\n\n\n\nReligious (81%)\nAtheists (3%)\nIrreligion (13%)\nNot stated (3%)\n\nIndia has a population of 123 crore per a 2012 demographic survey by Indian government.[157] According to the 2012 WIN-Gallup Global Index of Religion and Atheism report, 81% of Indians were religious, 13% were non-religious, 3% were convinced atheists, and 3% were unsure or did not respond.[123]\n\n\nCambridge University Press in 2004 demographic study, have found that there are 102.87 million atheists and agnostics living in India, thus constituting \n9.1% of the total population, out of total 1.1296 billion people respectively.[158][159]\n\n\n\n## Religion and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indian Mujahideen, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, and List of organisations banned by the Government of India\n\nSee also: Freedom of religion in India\n\n![](image)Takht Sri Hazur Sahib in Nanded was built over the place where Guru Gobind Singh Ji was cremated in 1708; the inner chamber is still called *Angitha Sahib*.\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nReligious politics, particularly that expressed by the Hindutva movement, has strongly influenced Indian politics in the last quarter of the 20th century. Many of the elements underlying India's casteism and communalism originated during the colonial era, when the colonial government frequently politicized religion in an attempt to stave off increasing nationalistic sentiments in India.[160] The Indian Councils Act 1909 (widely known as the Morley-Minto Reforms Act), which established separate Hindu and Muslim electorates for the Imperial Legislature and provincial councils, was particularly divisive, increasing tensions between the two communities.[161]\n\n\nDue to the high degree of oppression faced by the lower castes, the Constitution of India included provisions for affirmative action for certain sections of Indian society. Many states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) introduced laws that made conversion more difficult; they assert that such conversions are often forced or allured.[162] The BJP, a national political party, also gained widespread media attention after its leaders associated themselves with the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and other prominent religious issues.[163]\n\n\nA well-known accusation that Indian political parties make for their rivals is that they play vote bank politics, meaning give political support to issues for the sole purpose of gaining the votes of members of a particular community. Both the Congress Party and the BJP have been accused of exploiting the people by indulging in vote bank politics. The Shah Bano case, a divorce lawsuit, generated much controversy when the Congress was accused of appeasing the Muslim orthodoxy by bringing in a parliamentary amendment to negate the Supreme Court's decision. After the 2002 Gujarat violence, there were allegations of political parties indulging in vote bank politics.[164]\n\n\nCaste-based politics is also important in India; caste-based discrimination and the reservation system continue to be major issues that are hotly debated.[165][166]\n\n\n\n### Communalism[edit]\n\n\nCommunalism has played a key role in shaping the religious history of modern India. After Indian independence in 1947, India was partitioned along religious lines into two states\u2014the Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan (comprising what is now the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the People's Republic of Bangladesh) and the Hindu-majority Union of India (later the Republic of India). The partition led to rioting amongst Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs in Punjab, Bengal, Delhi, and other parts of India; 500,000 died as a result of the violence. The twelve million refugees that moved between the newly founded nations of India and Pakistan composed one of the largest mass migrations in modern history.[\u0394][167] Since its independence, India has periodically witnessed large-scale violence sparked by underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities. The Republic of India is secular; the Indian government recognizes no official religion.\n\n\n\n### Communal conflicts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Religious violence in India and Terrorism in India\n\n![](image)Aftermath of Hindu-Muslim clashes in Calcutta, following the 1946 Direct Action Day, which was announced by the All India Muslim League to show the strength of Muslim feelings towards its demand for an \"autonomous and sovereign\" Muslim state called *Pakistan*.[168][169]\nCommunal conflicts have periodically plagued India since it became independent in 1947.[170] The roots of such strife lie largely in the underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, which emerged under the Raj and during the bloody Partition of India. Such conflict also stems from the competing ideologies of Hindu nationalism versus Islamic fundamentalism; both are prevalent in parts of the Hindu and Muslim populations. This issue has plagued India since before independence. The lack of education among the masses and the ease with which corrupt politicians can take advantage of the same has been attributed as the major reason for religious conflicts in India. Even though Freedom of religion is an integral part of the India constitution, the inability to hold a communal mob accountable for its collectove actions has limited the exercise of religious freedom in India.\n\n\nAlongside other major Indian independence leaders, Mahatma Gandhi and his *Shanti sainiks* (\"peace soldiers\") worked to quell early outbreaks of religious conflict in Bengal, including riots in Calcutta (now in West Bengal) and Noakhali District (in modern-day Bangladesh) that accompanied Muhammad Ali Jinnah's Direct Action Day, which was launched on 16 August 1946. These conflicts, waged largely with rocks and knives and accompanied by widespread looting and arson, were crude affairs. Explosives and firearms, which are rarely found in India, were far less likely to be used.[171]\n\n\nMajor post-independence communal conflicts include the 1984 Anti-Sikh riots, which followed Operation Blue Star by the Indian Army; heavy artillery, tanks, and helicopters were employed against the Sikh partisans inside the Harmandir Sahib, causing heavy damage to Sikhism's holiest Gurdwara. According to the Indian government estimates, the assault caused the deaths of up to 100 soldiers, 250 militants, and hundreds of civilians.[172]\n\n\nThis triggered Indira Gandhi's assassination by her outraged Sikh bodyguards on 31 October 1984, which set off a four-day period during which Sikhs were massacred; The Government of India reported 2,700 Sikh deaths however human rights organizations and newspapers report the death toll to be 10,000\u201317,000. In the aftermath of the riot, the Government of India reported 20,000 had fled the city, however the PUCL reported \"at least\" 50,000 displaced persons.[173]\n\n\nThe most affected regions were neighbourhoods in Delhi. Human rights organisations and the newspapers believe the massacre was organised.[174] The collusion of political officials in the massacres and the failure to prosecute any killers alienated normal Sikhs and increased support for the Khalistan movement. The Akal Takht, the governing religious body of Sikhism, considers the killings to be a genocide.[175]\n\n\nOther incidents include the 1992 Bombay riots that followed the demolition of the Babri Mosque as a result of the Ayodhya debate, and the 2002 Gujarat violence where 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed and which was preceded by the Godhra Train Burning.[176] Lesser incidents plague many towns and villages; the representative was the killing of five people in Mau, Uttar Pradesh during Hindu-Muslim rioting, which was triggered by the proposed celebration of a Hindu festival.[176]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![icon](image)Religion portal\n\n\n* Dalit Buddhist movement\n* List of Hindu festivals\n* Religion in Kerala\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n* **^**\u00a0**\u03b1:**\u00a0The data exclude the Mao-Maram, Paomata, and Purul subdivisions of Manipur's Senapati district.\n* **^**\u00a0**\u03b2:**\u00a0The data are \"unadjusted\" (without excluding Assam and Jammu and Kashmir); the 1981 census was not conducted in Assam and the 1991 census was not conducted in Jammu and Kashmir.\n* **^**\u00a0**\u03b3:**\u00a0Oberlies (1998, p. 155) gives an estimate of 1100 BCE for the youngest hymns in book ten.

The Thai Constitution does not indicate any state religion, but promotes Buddhism, while guaranteeing religious freedom for all Thai citizens. Many other people, especially among the Isan ethnic group, practice Tai folk religions. A significant Muslim population, mostly constituted by Thai Malays, is present especially in the southern regions. Thai law officially recognizes five religions: Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, and Christianity.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wat Arun, a Theravada Buddhist temple, at twilight\nAccording to official census data, approximately 95% of Thais follow Buddhism. However, the religious life of the country is more complex than how it is portrayed by such statistics. Of the large Thai Chinese population, most of those who follow Buddhism have been integrated into the dominant Theravada tradition, with only a small minority having retained Chinese Buddhism. Otherwise, a large part of the Thai Chinese have retained the practice of ethnic Chinese religion, including Taoism, Confucianism and Chinese salvationist religions (such as Yiguandao and the Church of Virtue). Despite being practised freely, these religions have no official recognition, and their followers are counted as Theravada Buddhists in statistical studies.[4] Also, many Thai and Isan practise their ethnic Tai folk religion.\n\n\nMuslims are the second largest religious group in Thailand at 4% to 5% of the population. Thailand's southernmost provinces - Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, Satun, Trang, and part of Songkhla - have large Muslim populations, consisting of both ethnic Thai and Malay. \n\n\nChristians, mainly Catholics, represent just over 1% of the population. A small but influential community of Sikhs in Thailand and some Hindus, mostly live in the country's cities and are engaged in retail commerce. There is also a small Jewish community in Thailand, dating back to the 17th century.\n\n\nAccording to the 2015 Gallup International survey, Thailand was the most religious country of the 65 countries polled, with 94% of Thais identifying as religious.[5]\n\n\n\n## Censuses[edit]\n\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Religion\n | Census 2010[6] | Census 2015[7] | Census 2018[1] |\n| --- | --- | --- |

Buddhism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Buddhism in Thailand\n\nBuddhism in Thailand is largely of the Theravada school. Over 90% of Thailand's population adheres to this school.\n\n\nThai Buddhism is practised alongside various indigenous religions, such as Chinese indigenous religion by the large Thai of Chinese origins, Hinduism among Thai of Indian origin and Siamese Thai people,[85] Thai folk religion among Northeastern Thai, Northern Thai and Northern Khmer people, and Peranakan folk religion for Peranakans.\n\n\nBuddhist temples in Thailand are characterised by tall golden stupas, and the Buddhist architecture of Thailand is similar to that in other Southeast Asian countries, especially Cambodia and Laos, which share a cultural and historical heritage with Thailand.\n\n\n\n### Hinduism[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Hinduism in Thailand, Jatukham Rammathep, and Hinduism in Southeast Asia\n\nSeveral thousand Hindus of Indian origin live in Thailand, mainly in the larger cities. Besides this group of \"traditional Hindus\", Thailand in its earliest days was under the rule of the Khmer Empire, which had strong Hindu roots, and the influence among Thais remains even today. There are also some ethnic Cham Hindus living in Thailand.[86] The popular *Ramakien* epic based on Buddhist Dasaratha Jataka is very similar to the Hindu Ramayana. The former capital of Ayutthaya was named for Ayodhya, the Indian birthplace of the Rama, the protagonist of the story.\nThere is a class of brahmins who perform rituals for Hindu gods.[85] Brahmin rituals are still common. Hindu-Buddhist deities are worshipped by many Thais and statues and shrines of Brahma, Ganesh, Indra, Shiva, Vishnu, Lakshmi and other Hindu-Buddhist gods are a common sight (for example the Erawan Shrine area). Another relic of Hinduism is Garuda, now a symbol of the monarchy.\n\n\n\n## Folk religions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jui Tui Shrine in Phuket at night.\n![](image)San Phanthai Norasing, a shrine to a local deity associated with the rooster in Mueang Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon Province.\n### Chinese folk religion[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chinese folk religion and Tudigong\n\nMany within the large Thai Chinese population (excluding the Peranakans) practise various Chinese religions, including the worship of local gods, Chinese ancestral worship, Taoism, Confucianism and Chinese salvationist religions.[4] One of the latter, Yiguandao (Thai: *Anuttharatham*), spread to Thailand since the 1970s, and it has grown so popular to come into conflict with Buddhism; in 2009 there were more than 7000 Yiguandao churches in the country and approximately 200.000 people convert each year into the religion.[87] Despite the large number of followers and temples these religions have no state recognition, their temples are not counted as places of worship, and their followers are counted as \"Theravada Buddhists\" in officially released religious figures.[4] Chinese temples are called *sanchao* in Thai language.[4]\n\n\nThe Chinese folk religion of Thailand has developed local features, including the worship of local gods.[4] Major Chinese festivals such as Nian, Zhongqiu, and Qingming, are widely celebrated, especially in Bangkok, Chonburi, and other parts of Thailand where there are large Chinese populations.[88] Thai of Teochew and Hoklo origin generally worship Guanyin and Mazu, while Cantonese origin worship Guan Yu.\n\n\n\n### Peranakan folk religion[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chinese folk religion in Southeast Asia and Nine Emperor Gods Festival\n\nThe Peranakans in the city of Phuket practise a nine-day vegetarian festival between September and October. During the festive season, devotees will abstain from meat and mortification of the flesh by Chinese mediums is also commonly seen. The rites and rituals are devoted to the veneration of Tua Pek Kong. Such traditions were developed during the 19th century in Phuket by the local Chinese with influences from Malay and Southern Thai culture.[89]\n\n\n\n### Thai folk religion[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Tai folk religion, Spirit house, and Rocket Festival\n\nMost of Northeastern Thai (as well as Northern Thai, Northern Khmer and some Siamese Thai) practise distinctive indigenous religions characterised by worship of local gods and ancestors. They are very similar to the Chinese folk religion.\n\n\n\n## Abrahamic religions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Haroon Mosque, one of the oldest mosques in Bangkok\n### Islam[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Islam in Thailand\n\nAccording to the 2015 census, Thailand has 2,892,311 Muslims, or 4.29% of the total population. 2,227,613 of these Muslims are concentrated in the southern region of the country, where they represent up to 24.33% of the population.[7]\n\n\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Holy Redeemer Church in Bangkok, built in Thai architecture\nMain article: Christianity in Thailand\n\nChristianity was introduced by European missionaries as early as the 1550s, when Portuguese mercenaries and their chaplain arrived in Ayutthaya. Historically, it has played a significant role in the modernisation of Thailand, notably in social and educational institutions.[90] As of 2015 just over one percent of the population of Thailand are Christians.[7] Of that group, 400,000 are estimated to be Catholics.[91]\n\n\nThailand's Department of Religion, currently under the Ministry of Culture, has formally recognised five major Christian churches/denominations: the Catholic Church, the Southern Baptists, the Seventh-day Adventists, the Church of Christ in Thailand, and the Evangelical Fellowship of Thailand. Although not officially recognised, missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) have been active in Thailand for decades, though their converts are comparatively few.\nAlso present Jehovah's Witnesses \nwith over 5200 members and 140 congregations\n\n\n\n### Judaism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Jews in Thailand\n\nJudaism in Thailand dates back to the 17th century, with the arrival of a few Baghdadi Jewish families. The present community consists of both Ashkenazi (for instance the expatriate community plus some descendants of refugees from imperial Russia and later the Soviet Union), and Sephardi Jews, who were born in such places as Afghanistan, Iran and Syria, and wealthy gem traders. Most of the Jewish community in Thailand, consisting of an estimated 2,000 residents, reside in Bangkok,[92] although there are at any given time thousands of tourists (some long-term) coming primarily from Israel. There are Jewish synagogues in Phuket, Chiang Mai, and Ko Samui, but no community there.\n\n\n\n## Other religions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gurudwara Siri Guru Singh Sabha in Bangkok.\n### Sikhism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sikhism in Thailand\n\nThe first Sikh known to have come to Thailand was Ladha Singh, who arrived in 1890. Other Sikhs joined him in the early 1900s, and by 1911 more than a hundred Sikh families had settled in Thailand, mainly in Thonburi Region. There were at that time no gurdwaras (Sikh temples), and religious prayers were held in private homes every Sunday and on gurpurab days. The Sikh community continued to grow, and in 1912 it was decided to build a gurdwara. It stands today in Bangkok's Pahurat area and imitates the Golden Temple in Amritsar Punjab, India. A tiny but influential community of Sikhs live in the country's cities, most engaged in retail commerce.\n\n\n\n## Freedom of religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Buddhist monk talking to a Catholic priest in a temple in KanchanaburiMain article: Freedom of religion in Thailand\n\nThe constitution \u201cprohibits discrimination based on religious belief,\" and allows all persons to practice any religion of their choice. Religious groups can operate freely with or without government registration. \n\n\nThe government has a quota for the number of foreign missionaries working in the country: 1,357 Christian, six Muslim, 20 Hindu, and 41 Sikh. Benefits include longer visa stays. \n\n\nIn 2022, violence against religious groups was reported in the Deep South; however it is difficult to separate this from ethnic violence.[93] Due to this violence, in 2023, the country was scored 3 out of 4 for religious freedom.[94]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Including Thai and Chinese indigenous religions.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Population by religion, region and area, 2018\".
