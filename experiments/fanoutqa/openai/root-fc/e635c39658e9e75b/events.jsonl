The castle and his upbringing in Framlingham is the subject of his 2017 single \"Castle on the Hill\".[6]\nEdward Christopher Sheeran was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England on 17 February 1991.[7][8] His early childhood home was on Birchcliffe Road in nearby Hebden Bridge.[9] His father was a curator at Cartwright Hall in Bradford, and his mother worked at Manchester City Art Gallery.[9] In December 1995, he moved with his family from Hebden Bridge to Framlingham in Suffolk,[10][11] where he attended the independent Brandeston Hall preparatory school (now Framlingham College Prep School),[12][13][14] then Thomas Mills High School, also in Framlingham.[15][16] He has an older brother named Matthew, who works as a composer.[17] Sheeran's parents, John and Imogen, are from London. His father is Irish,[18][19][20] and Sheeran has stated that his father is from a \"very large\" Catholic family.[21] John is an art curator and lecturer, and Imogen is a culture publicist turned jewellery designer.[19][22] His parents ran Sheeran Lock, an independent art consultancy, from 1990 to 2010.[23]\n\n\nSheeran sang at a local church choir at the age of four, learned how to play the guitar at age eleven,[24] and began writing songs while at Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham.[15][16] He also played the cello when he was younger.[25] A 2004 school report described him as a \"natural performer\", and his classmates also voted him \"most likely to be famous\".[26] He was accepted at the National Youth Theatre in London as a teenager.[27][28] He successfully auditioned for Youth Music Theatre UK in 2007 and joined their production of *Frankenstein – A New Musical* in Plymouth.[29] He is a patron of Youth Music Theatre UK (now renamed British Youth Music Theatre)[30] and of Access to Music, where he studied Artist Development.[31][32] Sheeran is a second cousin of Northern Irish broadcaster Gordon Burns,[33] who hosted the British game show *The Krypton Factor*.[19]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2004–2010: Career beginnings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran performing at the Ipswich Arts Festival in July 2010\nSheeran began recording music in 2004, and at the age of thirteen independently released his first collection of work, titled *Spinning Man*.[A] He has been friends with fellow English singer Passenger since he was 15, with the two playing the same gig in Cambridge.[35] He moved to London in 2008 and began playing in small venues. In 2008, he auditioned for the ITV series *Britannia High*.[36] He also opened for Nizlopi in Norwich in April 2008, after being one of their guitar technicians.[16] In the autumn of 2009, Sheeran began studying music at the Academy of Contemporary Music (ACM) in Guildford, Surrey as an undergraduate at the age 18,[37] but left without permission in the same year to support hip-hop artist Just Jack.[38]\nHe released another EP in 2009, *You Need Me*, and also collaborated several times with Essex singer Leddra Chapman, including CeeLo Green's \"Fuck You\". In February 2010, Sheeran posted a video through SB.TV—a channel launched by British entrepreneur Jamal Edwards—and rapper Example invited Sheeran to tour with him.[39] In the same month, he also released his critically acclaimed *Loose Change* EP, which featured his future debut single, \"The A Team\".[40]\n\n\nSheeran began to be seen by more people over the internet through YouTube and his fan base expanded, with him also receiving praise from *The Independent* newspaper and Elton John.[41] He played a *Station Session* in St. Pancras International in June 2010.[42][43] Some of the episode is on their Facebook page[44] Sheeran also self-released two other EPs in 2010, *Ed Sheeran: Live at the Bedford* and *Songs I Wrote with Amy*, which is a collection of love songs he wrote in Wales with Amy Wadge.[45] When in Los Angeles in 2010, he was invited to perform at The Foxxhole, a club run by actor Jamie Foxx, which ended with an invitation to stay at Foxx's home.[46]\n\n\nOn 8 January 2011, Sheeran released another independent EP, *No. 5 Collaborations Project*, featuring grime artists such as Wiley, Jme, Devlin, Sway and Ghetts.[47] With this EP, Sheeran gained mainstream attention for having reached number 2 in the iTunes chart without any promotion or label, selling over 7,000 copies in the first week.[48] Three months later, Sheeran put on a free show to fans at the Barfly in Camden Town. Over 1,000 fans turned up, so Sheeran played four different shows to ensure everyone saw a gig, including a gig outside on the street after the venue had closed. Later that month, Sheeran was signed to Asylum Records.[48]\n\n\n\n### 2011–2013: Debut studio album, *+* (\"Plus\")[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 April 2011, Sheeran appeared on the BBC music show *Later... with Jools Holland*, where he performed his debut single \"The A Team\". Six weeks later, \"The A Team\" was released as a digital download in the UK. The release served as the lead single from Sheeran's debut studio album, *+* (\"Plus\").[49] \"The A Team\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number three, selling over 58,000 copies in the first week. It was the best-selling debut single and the overall eighth-best selling single of 2011, selling 801,000 copies.[50] The lead single also became a top ten hit in Australia, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway and the Netherlands.

These included seeing Eric Clapton at the Royal Albert Hall, Paul McCartney in Birmingham, and Bob Dylan.[206] On the influence of Clapton, Sheeran states, \"He's the reason I started playing guitar\".[24] He singled out Clapton's performance at the Party at the Palace in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, \"I was eleven when I saw Eric Clapton play at the Queen's Golden Jubilee concert in June 2002. I remember him walking on stage with this rainbow-coloured Stratocaster and playing the first riff of 'Layla'. I was hooked. Two days later I bought a black Stratocaster copy for £30 that came with an amp. All I did for the next month was try to play that 'Layla' riff.\"[207]\n\n\n\n\n> In a complicated world, Sheeran's musical *modus operandi* is straightforward; to create well-crafted, expertly vague songs that unite people. His songs are vessels broad enough to soundtrack both a first dance and a funeral procession, a gut-punch break-up and a trawl around a harshly lit shopping centre. They're for life's big moments, with all the cinematic edge of a Richard Curtis film. He's also malleable – when he's done with hip-hop, for example, he doesn't need an image overhaul to then revert to balladry. If one genre isn't to your tastes, then fear not, another will be along soon.\n> \n> — Michael Cragg in *The Guardian* on Sheeran's style of music and mass appeal.[208]\n> \n\n\nSheeran has also cited the Beatles, Nizlopi and Eminem as his biggest musical influences.[209][210] He is also a fan of heavier music and cites bands such as Cradle of Filth, Slipknot, Korn, Marilyn Manson and Bring Me the Horizon as other influences.[211][212] As a teenager, he also had a *Kerrang!* subscription.[213] According to Sheeran, he had a stutter in his speech when he was younger, and he credited rapping along to Eminem's *The Marshall Mathers LP* for helping him stammer less.[214] He was also inspired by \"Cannonball\" singer-songwriter Damien Rice in 2002, with Sheeran stating, \"seeing him play this small club in Ireland, I was able to meet him, and he was unbelievably cool. I went straight home and started writing songs. I would not be doing what I'm doing now if he'd been a jerk.\"[215] He also played the guitar to Westlife's *Greatest Hits* album when he was ten, citing them as one of his influences.[216][217] Sheeran collaborated with his idol Eric Clapton in April 2016, with Sheeran stating to *People* magazine, \"I sang on Eric Clapton's album *I Still Do*. It's one thing having him on mine, but being on his, that's an honour that you can't ever pinpoint on how great that is. I did something for his record, and I was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso', appearing as a guest on Clapton's 'I Will Be There', in addition to performing the song with Clapton on stage, and he did something for my record performing a guitar solo on 'Dive' on Sheeran's album *÷* and was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso'.\"[24] Sheeran also cited Taylor Swift as one of his influences, suggesting in 2015 their respective success drives each other on.[218]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Gingerbread Man Records[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Sheeran announced he was setting up a record label, Gingerbread Man Records, which is a deal with Warner Music Group.[219] The label was launched in August 2015 alongside its accompanying YouTube channel.[220] Jamie Lawson, the label's first signee, met Sheeran while they were both in London's folk circuit.[221] Lawson released his self-titled debut album on 9 October 2015, which has earned him a number one in the UK Albums Chart.[222] Sheeran signed his second artist, Foy Vance, in November 2015.[223] Maisie Peters also signed with the label in 2021.[224]\n\n\n\n### Bertie Blossoms[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 September 2019, Sheeran announced he was teaming up with his manager Stuart Camp to open a bar located on Portobello Road in Notting Hill.

And with certain subjects like this they're often washed over and people don't necessarily give them the attention they deserve.\" Tickets were available to those taking part in the charity's Give it up for One25 campaign by giving something up for 125 hours and hitting the £40,000 fundraising mark.[226]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran often wears hoodies or tartan shirts, and frequently donates his clothes to charity shops in Suffolk.\nSheeran frequently gives away his clothes to charity shops around Suffolk, his home county.[227] An ambassador for East Anglia's Children's Hospice, he has donated clothes to the St Elizabeth Hospice charity shop in his home town Framlingham, including eight bags of clothes to the shop in February 2014.[228] In 2016, he donated 13 bags of clothes to the shop.[229] The tartan shirt worn by Sheeran when he met Renee Zellweger's character, Bridget, in *Bridget Jones's Baby*, was auctioned online to raise further funds for the hospice.[229]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2014, Sheeran joined the charity supergroup Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the West African Ebola virus epidemic.[230]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Sheeran supported the No Cold Homes campaign by the UK charity, Turn2us.[231] Sheeran was one of nearly thirty celebrities, which included Helen Mirren, Jeremy Irons and Hugh Laurie, to donate items of winter clothing to the campaign, with the proceeds used to help people in the country struggling to keep their home warm in winter.[232]\n\n\nSheeran teamed up with the cast of the BBC3 mockumentary sitcom *People Just Do Nothing* to perform a charity single for the BBC's biennial telethon Comic Relief which aired in March 2017.[233] He appeared in a November 2017 episode of *Gogglebox* along with other UK celebrities such as Ozzy Osbourne, former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn as part of Channel 4 and Cancer Research UK's *Stand Up to Cancer* fundraising campaign.[234]\n\n\nIn December 2019, he launched his own music foundation, Ed Sheeran Suffolk Music Foundation (ESSMF).

The donations, which have been made over a two-year period via the Ed Sheeran Suffolk Music Foundation, helped the school to purchase items such as MacBooks, cameras and a photography darkroom.[236] The same month, Sheeran made a donation to Ipswich Hospital.[237] In June 2020, Sheeran made a \"founding gift\" to launch Suffolk Community Foundation's \"Rebuilding Local Lives Appeal\" in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on the celebration day of the county, \"Suffolk Day\". Sheeran has donated over £1 million to local charities in Suffolk amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including to a children's hospital ward.[238]\n\n\nSheeran's parents organised *The Ed Sheeran Made in Suffolk Legacy Auction* on 23 October 2020 which ran until 8 November. The auction had 220 lots, including items donated by other celebrities such as David Beckham, Kylie Minogue and Usain Bolt. Sheeran has donated some of his personal items including handwritten lyrics from his song \"Perfect\", lego bricks he played with as a kid, handmade *You Need Me* EP from 2009 and a £3 ticket to his first gig at the British Legion in Framlingham. The auction was made to raise money for Suffolk charities such as GeeWizz and Zest who both support children and young adults in the county, including redeveloping a playground for kids with special educational needs and disabilities in Ipswich. In November Sheeran sold one of his paintings, marking the first and only time his art has been made available for sale, which he titled \"Dab 2 2020\", to the same auction.[239] Later that month, Sheeran backed footballer Marcus Rashford's free school meals campaign and opened his own breakfast club at his Notting Hill restaurant, Bertie Blossoms. He announced on his Instagram that he provided hot breakfasts for \"anyone who is normally entitled to a free school meal or who is struggling in these strange times\".[240] Sheeran's charity, the Framlingham Foundation Trust, is reported to have donated money to give a primary school teacher to take an imperative course to help children create songs with untraditional instruments which will benefit children with learning difficulties.[241]\n\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Heinz \"Edchup\", released after Sheeran appeared in a 2019 advert for the company\nSheeran made his acting debut in 2014, a cameo role as himself on New Zealand soap opera *Shortland Street*, filmed while he was in the country for a one-off performance.[242] In May 2015, he appeared as himself and performed on a live episode of the NBC sitcom *Undateable*.[243] Later that year, while in Australia, he recorded scenes for the soap *Home and Away*, as a character based on himself.[244]\n\n\nAfter recording a cover version of Foy Vance's \"Make It Rain\" for *Sons of Anarchy*, Sheeran was cast by creator Kurt Sutter to play Sir Cormac in the medieval drama *The Bastard Executioner* on FX.[245] Sheeran also appeared as himself in the 2016 film *Bridget Jones's Baby* in a scene where Bridget Jones, played by Renée Zellweger, encounters the singer at the Glastonbury Festival.[246]\n\n\nIn July 2017, Sheeran appeared in a scene on *Game of Thrones* opposite Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark.[247] David Benioff explained that since Williams was a big fan of the singer, they wanted to have Sheeran appear on the show to surprise Williams, and that they had tried to get him on for years.[248] It received a mix of positive and very negative reviews.[249][250]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Sheeran made his debut appearance in an advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup.[251] A lifelong fan of the product—he has it with everything from fish and chips to his morning sausage \"butty\" to upmarket dinners, carries a bottle on tour, and has a Heinz Ketchup tattoo on his arm—he put forward an idea he had written for their next TV campaign, and the company responded.[251][252] A representative from Heinz stated that \"1/3 of @HEINZ Instagram posts include people mentioning or tagging Ed, dating all the way back to 2014.\"[253] Poking fun at people who turn their nose up at those who ask for ketchup in fancy restaurants, the advert sees him walking into a \"super posh\" restaurant while narrating the message he had sent to the company. As the other wealthy diners look on in horror at the sight of a ketchup bottle, he flips the bottle, bangs it against his hand to budge the ketchup and smothers it all over his food. The company released a limited edition ketchup product known as Ed Sheeran X Heinz ketchup, also known as \"Heinz Edchup\".[251]\n\n\nReleased in June 2019, Sheeran appeared as himself in a supporting role in the Richard Curtis/Danny Boyle film *Yesterday*, a film about a struggling singer-songwriter who wakes up to find that no one but he remembers the Beatles.[254]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran concert in Helsinki, August 2022. He had the highest-grossing tour of the 2010s, while his current tour, +–=÷x Tour, ranks among the highest-grossing tours of the 2020s.\nMusic journalist Alexis Petridis has stated that Ed Sheeran \"brought pop back down to earth\" with his music style, introducing himself \"touting an even more austere version of Coldplay's dressed-down authenticity: one unassuming man, his guitar and a loop pedal\". Noting him as \"one of the most influential\" artists of his generation, as he spawned \"endless imitators\", Petridis remarked that the music charts were \"packed with Sheeran-alikes\" after *×*, describing it as \"the wave of earnest, dressed-down, boy-next-door troubadours\" that reached critical mass.[255] Similarly, *The Guardian* writer Laura Snapes cited him as \"the godfather of the current crop of singer-songwriters\" in 2019, stating that Sheeran inspired \"troubadours\" to enter the music charts, and marked \"the calcification of the everyman male pop star\", and the end of record labels marketing them \"exclusively to teenage girls and their mums.\"[256] *Billboard* writer Jason Lipshutz noticed that his appeal and performance style had influenced up-and-coming soloists, impacting \"a significant number of pop artists who crave his type of singular success.\"[257] The *Financial Times* considered that the scale of Sheeran's commercial accomplishments has \"broken through to such a wide and lucrative extent, far beyond the achievements of any of the other singer-songwriters in the market\" in the UK.[258]\n\n\niHeartMedia senior executive Sharon Dastur declared that Sheeran's success has allowed newer artists to be given an opportunity in the mainstream scene with quieter material at the forefront, instead of dance music.[257] *GQ*'s George Chesterton deemed Sheeran \"the de facto voice of a generation\" as a consequence of his music reflecting his personality and \"the defining characteristics of his audience\", with such recurring qualities of his discography corresponding \"with those that his own generation, the millennials, most value: authenticity, realness, earnestness, sincerity.\"[259] BBC Radio 1 executive George Ergatoudis has stated that his \"lyrical candour\" and his \"professional hunger\" resonated with younger listeners, giving him a \"very clear edge\" to breakthrough in a music industry that is \"saturated with singer-songwriters\", while Sheeran's \"niche combination\" has made him able to perform at hip-hop, grime and underground events and \"convince the urban crowd that he was authentic\".[258] According to *Vox*, Sheeran has reached \"global pop culture ubiquity\".[260] In 2017, the BBC named him the second-best performing artist of the decade, after Adele,[261] while in 2021, *The Independent* said he had \"one of the biggest pop careers of this generation.\"[262] *Billboard*,[263] *The Financial Express*,[264] *The Brandon Sun*[265] and *Arab News*[266] have cited him as a \"British music icon\". Sheeran and his work have influenced various recording artists, including Shawn Mendes,[267] Louis Tomlinson,[268] Camila Cabello[269] and Cody Simpson.[270]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Ed Sheeran\n\nOn 19 October 2015, Sheeran received an honorary degree from the University of Suffolk in Ipswich for his \"outstanding contribution to music\".[271] Sheeran commented: \"Suffolk is very much where I call home. Receiving this recognition is a real privilege.\"[271] He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for \"services to music and charity\".[272] Sheeran received the award from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace on 7 December 2017.[273] In 2012, he was named a baron of Sealand.[274]\n\n\nIn addition to having the highest-grossing concert tour and being one of the world's best-selling music artists with more than 150 million records sold, Sheeran has received a number of awards. As of 2019, he has received four Grammy Awards (including Song of the Year in 2016 for \"Thinking Out Loud\"), five Brit Awards (including British Male Solo Artist in 2015), and six *Billboard* Music Awards (including Top Artist in 2018).[98][113][151] In 2015 and 2018, he received the Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.[99][275]\n\n\nAlthough he regards Suffolk as home having moved to the county as a young child, Sheeran was recognised by his county of birth in a 2018 poll when he was ranked the fourth-greatest Yorkshireman ever behind Monty Python comedian Michael Palin, and actors Sean Bean and Patrick Stewart.[276]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran's tattoos are either connected to his family, achievements, or memories.\nIn early 2011, after securing recording and publishing deals, Sheeran purchased and renovated a farm near Framlingham, Suffolk, where he was raised. He has stated that he hopes to raise a family there.[76][277] During 2013, he lived between Hendersonville, Tennessee[278] and Los Angeles, California.[279] In 2014, he bought a house in South London.[76]\n\n\nSheeran was in a relationship with Scottish singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt (who was in his music video for \"Drunk\") in 2012, before breaking up.[280] Nesbitt is the subject of Sheeran's songs \"Nina\" and \"Photograph\", while most of Nesbitt's album, *Peroxide*, is about Sheeran.[280] In 2014, Sheeran was in a relationship with Athina Andrelos, who works for chef Jamie Oliver.[281] She is the inspiration of Sheeran's song \"Thinking Out Loud\".[282] They broke up in February 2015.[282] He is also close friends with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift; the pair collaborated on her albums *Red* (original and re-recorded versions) and *Reputation*, as well as on a remix of the song \"The Joker and the Queen\" from Sheeran's album *=*.[24][283]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Sheeran began a relationship with childhood friend and former secondary school classmate Cherry Seaborn.[284] They announced their engagement in January 2018 and were married a year later.[285][286] She is the inspiration of the song \"Perfect\".[287] It was reported on 12 August 2020 that the couple were expecting their first child.[288][289] On 1 September, Sheeran announced on Instagram that Seaborn had given birth to a baby girl the previous week.[290] On 19 May 2022, it was announced that the couple's second child, a girl, was born.[291]\n\n\nSheeran is a supporter of his local football club Ipswich Town,[292] and his +–=÷x Tour kit sponsored their 2021–22 season.[293] Additionally, Sheeran was named in the club's squad list and given the squad number of 17.[294] His +–=÷x Tour kit sponsorship deal with Ipswich Town was renewed for the 2022–23 season.[295] A collector of Panini's FIFA World Cup sticker album, he completed the 2014 World Cup album.[296] Appearing as a guest on BBC Radio 4's *Desert Island Discs* on 7 May 2017, Sheeran chose *His Dark Materials* by Philip Pullman as his book of choice, and a lifetime supply of ketchup as the one inanimate luxury item that he would take with him on a desert island.[297]\n\n\nIn June 2015, *Forbes* listed his earnings at $57 million for the previous 12 months, and ranked him the 27th-highest-earning celebrity in the world.[298] In July 2018, *Forbes* named Sheeran ninth on their list of the highest-paid celebrities.[299] According to *The Sunday Times* Rich List of 2019, Sheeran is worth £160 million (US$207 million) as the 17th-richest musician in the UK.[300] Sheeran's net worth is estimated at £200 million in 2020.[301]\n\n\nOn 24 October 2021, Sheeran tested positive for COVID-19 less than a week before the release of his fifth album.[302] On 1 March 2023, he revealed that his wife, while pregnant, had developed a tumour with \"no route to treatment until after the birth\".[303]\n\n\n\n## Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nSheeran has faced accusations of plagiarism with regards to chord progression and other elements of his music. However, tort actions which have reached a jury have all been decided decisively in Sheeran's favour. \n\n\nIn 2017, Sheeran settled out of court over claims his song \"Photograph\" was a \"note-for-note\" copy of the chorus in the song \"Amazing\" by *X Factor* UK winner Matt Cardle.[304] Sheeran later regretted the decision to settle, saying that it was done on the advice of his lawyers who thought the case was \"more trouble than it was worth.\"[305] He said he regretted settling the claim not because of the money involved, but because it changed his relationship with the song. He said: \"I didn't play 'Photograph' for ages after that. I just stopped playing it. I felt weird about it, it kind of made me feel dirty.\" He also thought that settling the case opened a floodgate of claims, including the \"Shape of You\" lawsuit.[306]\n\n\nIn 2018, legal action was brought against Sheeran, Sony/ATV Music Publishing and Atlantic Records by the estate and heirs of the late producer Ed Townsend, who co-wrote the song \"Let's Get It On\" with Marvin Gaye. US District Judge Louis Stanton rejected Sheeran's call in 2019 for dismissal of a legal case accusing him of copying parts of the song in \"Thinking Out Loud\". Stanton said that a jury should decide but that he found \"substantial similarities between several of the two works' musical elements\".[307] A previous case by Townsend's estate was dismissed without prejudice in February 2017.[308]\n\n\nThe case, closely followed by those in music and legal circles, went to trial on in New York in April 2023. Sheeran's lawyers argued that while the two songs have similar \"building blocks\" and a specific chord progression, such features are true for many pop songs, and the jury found in favour of Sheeran with a unanimous verdict.[309] After winning the trial, Sheeran said: \"These chords are common building blocks which were used to create music long before 'Let's Get It On' was written and will be used to create music long after we are all gone.\"[310]\n\n\nSheeran was taken also to court in March 2022 for a copyright lawsuit over \"Shape of You\". Musicians Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue alleged that the song infringed \"particular lines and phrases\" of their 2015 composition \"Oh Why\".[311] Sheeran won the case, with Mr Justice Zacaroli ruling he \"neither deliberately nor subconsciously\" copied a phrase from \"Oh Why\" when writing \"Shape of You\".[312][313]\n\n\n\n## Political views[edit]\n\n\nSheeran publicly opposed Brexit (the United Kingdom leaving the European Union), and supported \"remain\". Following the June 2016 referendum result where the British public voted to leave, Sheeran was among a group of British musicians (which included Sting, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason and Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz) who signed a letter to then Prime Minister Theresa May, drafted by Bob Geldof in October 2018, calling for \"a 2nd vote\". Stating that Brexit will \"impact every aspect of the music industry. From touring to sales, to copyright legislation to royalty collation\", the letter adds: \"We dominate the market and our bands, singers, musicians, writers, producers and engineers work all over Europe and the world and in turn, Europe and the world come to us. Why? Because we are brilliant at it ... [Our music] reaches out, all inclusive, and embraces anyone and everyone. And that truly is what Britain is.\"[314]\n\n\nIn 2017, Sheeran publicly endorsed the Labour Party and then-leader Jeremy Corbyn, while adding that \"I'm not Mr Political. I vote the way I feel I should, but won't tell somebody else what to do.\"[315]\n\n\nIn 2021, Sheeran, along with several other celebrities, urged the United States Congress to pass the proposed Equality Act, which would expand the Civil Rights Act in order to outlaw discrimination against LGBT people. Sheeran stated in the open letter that the Act is \"essential to protect [...] the most marginalized communities.\"[316]\n\n\nIn 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sheeran expressed support for Ukraine and participated in the Concert for Ukraine.[317]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ed Sheeran discography\n\n* *+* (2011)\n* *×* (2014)\n* *÷* (2017)\n* *No.6 Collaborations Project* (2019)\n* *=* (2021)\n* *−* (2023)\n* *Autumn Variations* (2023)\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *Shortland Street* | Himself\n |  | [242] |\n| 2015\n | *Undateable* | Himself\n |  | [243] |\n| *Home and Away* | Teddy\n |  | [244] |\n| *The Bastard Executioner* | Sir Cormac\n | 5 episodes\n | [245] |\n| *Jumpers for Goalposts: Live at Wembley Stadium* | Himself\n | Concert film\n | [318] |\n| 2016\n | *Bridget Jones's Baby* | Himself\n |  | [319] |\n| *Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping* | Himself\n | Uncredited\n | [320] |\n| 2017\n | *Game of Thrones* | Lannister soldier\n | Episode: \"Dragonstone\"\n | [321] |\n| 2018\n | *The Simpsons* | Brendan (voice)\n | Episode: \"Haw-Haw Land\"\n | [322] |\n| *Songwriter* | Himself\n | Documentary\n | [323] |\n| 2019\n | *Yesterday* | Himself\n |  | [324] |\n| *Modern Love* | Mick\n | Episode: \"Hers was a World of One\"\n | [325] |\n| *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* | Alien\n | Uncredited cameo\n | [326] |\n| 2021\n | *Red Notice* | Himself\n | Cameo\n | [327] |\n| 2023\n | *The Sum of It All* | Himself\n | Docuseries\n | [328] |\n| 2023\n | *Sumotherhood*[329] | TBC\n |  |\n\n\n### Commercials[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Product(s)\n | Brand(s)\n | Role\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019\n | \"Edchup\"\n | Heinz | Himself\n | [330] |\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\n### Headlining act[edit]\n\n\n* + Tour (2011–13)\n* × Tour (2014–15)\n* ÷ Tour (2017–19)\n* +–=÷× Tour (2022–24)\n* - Tour (2023)\n\n\n### Opening act[edit]\n\n\n* Snow Patrol's Fallen Empires Tour (North American select dates) (2012)\n* Taylor Swift's The Red Tour (all North American dates) (2013)\n* The Rolling Stones' Zip Code Tour (Kansas City only)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Official Subscription Plays Chart number-one songs of the 2010s\n* List of highest-grossing live music artists\n* List of YouTubers\n\n\nPortals:* ![](image) Biography\n* ![flag](image) England\n* ![icon](image) Pop music\n* ![icon](image) internet\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"In 2004, I made my very first album, *Spinning Man*, named after a picture that my dad had. I burnt the CDs myself and made the covers. There were 14 songs and they were all songs that rhymed. One lyric went: **I'm a typical average teen, if you know what I mean.** There are probably 20 copies of Spinning Man in existence and I have 19 of them. I don't want anyone else to get hold of a copy. Most of the songs were about a girl named Claire. She was my first love when I was 13. It was a very innocent love and we only ever held hands, but it lasted a fair amount of time. Then came my first devastating break-up. Looking back, it really wasn't that bad, but at the time it was soul-shattering. When she left me, I wrote a lot of songs off the back of it—my first love songs.\"[34]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Ed Sheeran Hates Kale, Speaks German And 99 Other Things You Probably Didn't Know About Him\".

The number of attendance is often considered to measure the success of a tour. However, the most-attended tours do not necessarily generate the largest profit due to ticket pricing. Rankings of most successful tours are generally based on gross revenue instead of number of attendance.[1] *Pollstar* and *Billboard* provide boxscores which are the primary data showing the commercial performance of tours. However, since not all concerts are reported to those publications, especially prior to the 2000s decade, the number of tickets sold may rely on estimations by other reliable sources.\n\n\nTours may score a very large attendance in total because of their extensive number of shows which can span multiple calendar years. Currently, Ed Sheeran's ÷ Tour is the most-attended tour of all time, with a total of 8.9 million tickets sold in 260 shows across three different years (2017–2019).[2] It also holds the record for the most-attended tour in a year, attracting 4.86 million people in 2018. U2 scored the annual most-attended tours at least six times since 1997, more than any other act. Meanwhile, Tina Turner, Cher, and Madonna are the only women having a tour attended by 3.5 million people or more. According to *Pollstar* and *Billboard* reports, no woman has ever achieved the largest tour attendance in a single year. Nevertheless, Taylor Swift holds the record for the fastest-selling tour of all time, with a total of 2.4 million tickets sold in a single day for the 2023 U.S. leg of the Eras Tour.\n\n\n\n\n## Most-attended tours[edit]\n\n\n### Over 5 million attendance[edit]\n\n\n\n\nKey\n| †\n | Indicates an ongoing concert tour\n |\n\n\n* ![Audience view of the Music of the Spheres World Tour in Brazil](image)\n\nAudience view of the Music of the Spheres World Tour in Brazil\n* ![Audience view of the +–=÷× Tour in Finland](image)\n\nAudience view of the +–=÷× Tour in Finland\n* ![Audience view of the U2 360° Tour in Spain](image)\n\nAudience view of the U2 360° Tour in Spain\n\n\n\n\nTours attended by 5 million people or more\n| Year(s)\n | Tour title\n | Artist\n | Tickets sold\n | Shows\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017–2019\n | ÷ Tour | Ed Sheeran | 8.8 million[a] | 260\n | [2] |\n| 2009–2011\n | U2 360° Tour | U2 | 7.2 million[b] | 110\n | [4] |\n| 2022–2023\n | Music of the Spheres World Tour | Coldplay | 6.6 million\n | 114\n | [5] |\n| 1994–1995\n | Voodoo Lounge Tour | The Rolling Stones | 6.5 million[c] | 129\n | [7] |\n| 2014–2017\n | The Garth Brooks World Tour (2014–2017) | Garth Brooks | 6.3 million\n | 390\n | [8] |\n| 2018–2023\n | Farewell Yellow Brick Road | Elton John | 6 million[d] | 330\n | [10] |\n| 1989–1990\n | Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour | The Rolling Stones | 6 million\n | 115\n | [11] |\n| 1994\n | The Division Bell Tour | Pink Floyd | 5.5 million\n | 112\n | [12] |\n| 1996–1998\n | The Garth Brooks World Tour (1996–1998) | Garth Brooks | 5.5 million\n | 220\n | [6] |\n| 2016–2017\n | A Head Full of Dreams Tour | Coldplay | 5.38 million\n | 114\n | [13] |\n| 2016–2019\n | Not in This Lifetime...

The tour began in Osaka, Japan on 6 August 2014, and continued through Europe, the Americas, Oceania and Asia until 12 December 2015, where the tour ended in New Zealand. Sheeran planned 180 shows. In June 2015, the singer announced a documentary would be filmed during the tour's three sold-out dates, 10–12 July 2015, at 80,000-person capacity Wembley Stadium.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nThroughout 2013, Sheeran supported Taylor Swift on her North American Red Tour, as well as performing throughout the show itself. He also is featured on her single, \"Everything Has Changed\", which was promoted at the Summertime Ball and the final of *Britain's Got Talent*. While touring, he began recording his second studio album, *×*. The album was preceded by the lead single, \"Sing\", which reached number one in the UK. The album, released on 20 June 2014, received critical acclaim, and Sheeran performed at series of festivals in 2014, including Glastonbury Festival, T in the Park and Southside Festival. On 14 April 2014, following a performance on *Saturday Night Live*, Sheeran announced his first ever North American arena tour. Beginning in Seattle, the 15-date tour would travel all around North America.[3] Due to demand, three dates were added to the tour (one date at the SAP Center and at the Staples Center in Los Angeles).\n\n\nDuring the 2015 leg of the X Tour, Ed Sheeran chose to use a Fender Stratocaster loaned to him by British contemporary artist Teddy McDonald. The guitar known as Green T featuring graphics by the artist was played in 18 countries and used for the songs requiring an electric guitar including \"Thinking Out Loud\". Green T was returned to Teddy McDonald at the end of the X Tour and later auctioned by Bonhams for £12,500 (Dec 2015). https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22818/lot/179/\n\n\nThe documentary movie *Jumpers for Goalposts: Live at Wembley Stadium* shot at Wembley Stadium at the end of the X Tour features the graffiti'd Fender Stratocaster Ed Sheeran commissioned as a collaboration between New York street art pioneer John Crash Matos and Teddy McDonald. Known as the 'Crash x Teddy M' Stratocaster, the guitar features the debut of the Teddy M Heart design and Crash's signature eye symbol. GQ magazine featured a full page article on the 'Crash x Teddy M' Stratocaster in their July 2015 edition.[4]\n\n\nAccording to Pollstar, the X Tour was the 43rd highest-grossing tour of 2014, with 667,066 tickets sold and US$33.4 million grossed.[5] The next year, the X Tour became the seventh highest-grossing tour of 2015, with 1,823,410 tickets sold and a gross of US$117.3 million,[6] accumulating a total of US$150.7 million grossed.\n\n\nThe support acts were: Rudimental, Rixton, Foy Vance, Kodaline and Christina Perri.\n\n\n\n## Set list[edit]\n\n\nThis set list is representative of the show on August 27, 2014. It does not represent all concerts for the duration of the tour.[7]\n\n\n\n1. \"I'm a Mess\"\n2. \"Lego House\"\n3. \"Don't\"\n4. \"Drunk\"\n5. \"Take It Back\"\n6. \"One\"\n7. \"Bloodstream\"\n8.

Comprising 260 shows, it officially began on 16 March 2017, in Turin, Italy and ended on 26 August 2019, in Ipswich, England. Ticket sales started on 2 February 2017.[3][4][5] The tour set world records for the highest-grossing concert tour and the most tickets sold by a tour.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\nOn the morning of 26 January 2017, the European dates of the tour were announced through Sheeran's social networks. Hours later through the same networks were announced the dates for Latin America. Tickets for the tour sold out quickly, prompting new dates to be added in London, Turin and Santiago. On 13 February 2017 it was announced that he would be part of the line up for a week of gigs at the Royal Albert Hall in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust taking place on 28 March 2017.[7] On 22 February 2017, Sheeran announced that Anne-Marie and Ryan McMullan would be the opening acts for the European dates.[8] On 8 March 2017, Sheeran announced the North American leg.[9] James Blunt was announced as the opening act, except for Indianapolis and Cleveland, where the opener was Joshua Radin. On 10 May 2017, Sheeran announced the Oceanian leg.[10] The tour was originally slated to have seven shows, but demand was high, the leg became eighteen shows.[11] On 8 June 2017, Sheeran announced the Asian leg of the tour, which was originally planned for October 2017 until November 2017.[12] However, due to bone fractures in his arms from a bike accident, he had to postpone and cancel parts of the Asian leg. Rescheduled shows in Manila, Osaka, and Tokyo occurred in April 2018, but Taipei, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Jakarta were cancelled.[13]\n\n\nLauv served as the opening act in Asia in November. On 28 June 2017, Sheeran announced a stadium tour across Europe. After the initial announcement, tickets sold quickly, which prompted new dates in Cork, Dublin, Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle, London, Cardiff, Amsterdam, Paris, Gothenburg, Munich, Zürich, Vienna, and Warsaw.[14] Anne-Marie returned as the opening act, while Jamie Lawson was added, and Beoga was added for Ireland. On 22 September 2017, Sheeran announced a stadium tour across North America.[15] On 6 February 2018, Sheeran added dates to the leg with new cities that were not in the initial announcement, and second shows in Toronto, Foxborough, and East Rutherford.[16] Snow Patrol was announced as the main opener for the North American stadium leg, along with Anne-Marie and Lauv in selected dates.[17] On 25 June 2018, Sheeran added two dates, performing in South Africa in March 2019.[18]\n\n\nOn 19 September 2018, Sheeran added more 2019 dates to the tour, performing in stadiums across Europe and the UK, starting in May 2019. Due to high demand, numerous additional dates were added to the tour itinerary.\n\n\nSheeran later added even more 2019 dates to the Divide tour, performing in Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina in February 2019. He also announced that he would be returning to Asia in April 2019, performing the long-awaited dates that were scheduled to take place in Fall 2017 but were cancelled and rescheduled due to bone fractures in the arms from a bike accident. The cities that were affected by the cancellation were Taipei, Seoul, Hong Kong and Jakarta. Sheeran will perform three Asia 2019 dates in Singapore, Seoul, and Bangkok. Sheeran later announced a second date in Cape Town, South Africa at Cape Town Stadium, scheduled for 28 March 2019. On 28 November, Sheeran added dates in Tokyo, Osaka, and Jakarta. On 10 January 2019, Sheeran added dates in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\nFor the last four shows, Sheeran played at Chantry Park in Ipswich in what was advertised as a homecoming set of gigs. For each of the four nights, a different additional support act performed; three were chosen by BBC Music Introducing in Suffolk and one by Hoax, all of which were local undercover artists. The local acts that performed were Bessie Turner, Caswell, Salvador and Piers James.[19]\n\n\n\n## Commercial performance[edit]\n\n\nIn Ireland, more than 300,000 tickets for seven shows across Cork, Belfast, Galway and Dublin were sold in a single day, making history with Sheeran being the only artist to ever do so in Irish territory.[20] Due to the phenomenal demand, extra dates were added in both Cork and Dublin, with three dates for each city in total.[21] Sellout status occurred once again in Santiago during his first concert on 15 May, prompting to add one more date.[22]\n\n\nIn Oceania, the tour broke the official record for the most tickets sold, at over 1 million (previously held by the Dire Straits Brothers in Arms Tour of 1985, with around 950,000), as well as most stadium shows by a single artist on one tour (18, formerly held by AC/DC at 14). Sheeran also broke records for the biggest stadium tour of Australia and New Zealand, venue record for highest cumulative attendance on one tour and venue record for highest attendance for a single show.[23] More than 710,000 tickets were sold within a single day of general public sale. In Sydney, a total of 243,513 tickets were sold for three shows at the ANZ Stadium, which rolled out over three successive nights from 15 to 17 March 2018. The attendance per show was 79,726, 81,752 and 82,035, respectively. This set a new record for aggregate attendance at a series of stadium concerts in NSW, smashing the old benchmark of 213,045 set by AC/DC during their Black Ice World Tour in 2010.[24]\n\n\nAccording to *Billboard*, Sheeran's tour grossed $776.4 million and sold 8.88 million tickets across the 201 dates reported from 16 March 2017 to 31 October 2018. The tour was the eighth highest-grossing tour of 2017, accumulating $122 million and selling 1,408,681 tickets.[25] The Divide Tour became 2018's highest-grossing tour with $429 million, setting all-time records for the highest-grossing solo tour and highest year-end gross ever.[26] It then broke the all-time highest-grossing record of $735m for any tour set by the U2 360° Tour before it finished, despite playing mostly in smaller venues and deliberately keeping the ticket price relatively low with no VIP areas. This is due to the larger number of shows (255) in the tour, and it also became the most attended tour of all time with over 8.5 million having attended in 43 countries with further dates to play.[6]\n\n\n\n## Set list[edit]\n\n\nThis set list is from the concert on 5 August 2017 in Glendale.

SoFi occupies the former site of the Hollywood Park Racetrack, 3 miles (4.8 km) from Los Angeles International Airport and 0.5 miles (0.80 km) southeast of Kia Forum. \n\n\nThe stadium complex is a component of Hollywood Park, a master planned neighborhood in development on the site of the former racetrack. Hollywood Park Casino re-opened in a new building on the property in October 2016, becoming the development's first establishment to open.[18]\n\n\nOpened in September 2020, the fixed-roof stadium is home to the National Football League (NFL)'s Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers, as well as the annual LA Bowl in college football. SoFi Stadium is one of two stadiums currently shared by a pair of NFL teams, the other being MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, shared by the New York Giants and New York Jets. It is the first stadium complex outside of the New York metropolitan area to host two NFL teams concurrently; the other three since the 1970 AFL–NFL merger have been Shea Stadium, Giants Stadium and MetLife Stadium.\n\n\nIn North American professional sports, it is the fourth stadium complex in Greater Los Angeles shared by more than one team from the same league. The other venues have been Crypto.com Arena, which has hosted both of the city's National Basketball Association (NBA) teams, the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers, since 1999 (although this arrangement will end by 2024); Dignity Health Sports Park, which was home to Major League Soccer (MLS)'s LA Galaxy and the now-defunct Chivas USA from 2005 to 2014; and Dodger Stadium, which was shared by Major League Baseball (MLB)'s Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Angels from 1962 to 1965.\n\n\nThe stadium hosted Super Bowl LVI on February 13, 2022, the College Football Playoff National Championship on January 9, 2023, WrestleMania 39 on April 1–2, 2023, and the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup final on July 16, 2023. It is scheduled to host multiple matches of the 2026 FIFA World Cup,[19] as well as the opening and closing ceremonies (as well as soccer and archery events) of the 2028 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n## Design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Southwest entrance into American Airlines Plaza between the stadium and the YouTube Theater\n![](image)East entrance\n![](image)The escalators at SoFi Stadium; September 18, 2022\nSoFi Stadium was designed by HKS and consists of the stadium itself, a pedestrian plaza, and a performance venue. Above the stadium is an independently supported translucent canopy which covers the stadium proper, the adjacent pedestrian plaza, and the attached performance venue. The million-square-foot canopy is made up of 302 ETFE panels, 46 of which can be opened to provide ventilation, supported by a cable net.[20] The canopy has 27,000 embedded LED pucks, which can display images and video that can also be seen from airplanes flying into Los Angeles International Airport.[21] The stadium bowl has open sides and seats 70,240 spectators for most events, with the ability to expand by 30,000 seats for larger events.[22] Despite the roof, the open sides of the stadium still make it vulnerable to lightning delays, with the first such delay in an NFL game between the Chargers and the Las Vegas Raiders on October 4, 2021.[23] The attached music and theatre venue, known as the YouTube Theater, has a capacity of 6,000 seats. The stadium and performance center are considered to be separate facilities under one roof.[24]\n\n\nAnother component of the stadium's design is the Infinity Screen by Samsung, an ovular, double-sided 4K HDR video board, the first of its kind, that is suspended from the roof over the field. Formerly known as \"the Oculus\" before a name change, the structure weighs 2.2 million pounds (1,000 t) and displays 80 million pixels.[25][26][27] The Infinity Screen also houses the stadium's 260-speaker audio system, as well as 56 5G wireless antennas.[28]\n\n\nOutdoor sports in California are usually played on grass due to the state's highly favorable climate. However, a grass field is very difficult to maintain to an acceptable standard when it is used by more than one gridiron football team. Because SoFi Stadium was intended from the outset to be used by two NFL teams, the designers opted not to install a natural playing surface. The stadium joined California Memorial Stadium as the only major sports facilities in California currently in use to have artificial turf installed.\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nSoFi Stadium has won a number of industry awards for its design, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n\n* \"Stadium of the Year\" in StadiumDB's Jury Award.[29]\n* \"Outstanding Architectural Engineering Project\" of 2021 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.[30]\n* The \"Excellence in Action\" Award to West Basin Municipal Water District (West Basin), the City of Inglewood, and other project partners for the SoFi Stadium Recycled Water Project.[31]\n* Steel Winner in Tekla's North America BIM Awards[32]\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Location discussions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hollywood Park Racetrack\n\nThe stadium site was previously home to **Hollywood Park**, later sold and referred to as **Betfair Hollywood Park**, which was a thoroughbred race course from 1938 until it was shut down for racing and training in December 2013. Most of the complex was demolished in 2014 to make way for new construction with the rest demolished in late 2016 after the Hollywood Park Casino, which remained open after the track itself closed, moved to a new building. The current stadium was not the first stadium proposed for the site. The site was almost home to an NFL stadium two decades earlier. In May 1995, after the departure of the Rams for St. Louis, the National Football League team owners approved, by a 27–1 vote with two abstentions, a resolution supporting a plan to build a $200 million, privately funded stadium on property owned by Hollywood Park for the Los Angeles Raiders. Al Davis, who was then the Raiders owner, balked and refused the deal over a stipulation that he would have had to accept a second team at the stadium.[33]\n\n\nOn January 31, 2014, the *Los Angeles Times* reported that Stan Kroenke, owner of the St. Louis Rams, purchased a 60-acre (24 ha) parcel of land just north of the Hollywood Park site in the area that had been studied by the National Football League in the past for the 1995 Raiders proposal and that the league at one point attempted to purchase.[34][35] This set off immediate speculation as to what Kroenke's intentions were for the site: After the site's former Hollywood Park owners gave up on getting an NFL stadium for the site in the mid-2000s it was sold and planned to be a Walmart Supercenter; however, in 2014, most of the speculation centered on the site as a possible stadium site or training facility for the Rams.[36] NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell represented that Kroenke informed the league of the purchase. As an NFL owner, any purchase of land in which a potential stadium could be built must be disclosed to the league. Speculation about the Rams' returning to their home of nearly fifty years had already been discussed when Kroenke was one of the finalists in bidding for ownership in the Los Angeles Dodgers, but speculation increased when the news broke that the Rams owner had a possible stadium site in hand.[37][38]\n\n\n\n![](image)2015 aerial view of former racetrack and complex site, with the Downtown Los Angeles skyline in background\nNearly a year went by without a word from Kroenke about his intentions for the land, as he failed to ever address the St. Louis media, or the Hollywood Park Land Company, about what the site may be used for. There was, however, speculation about the future of the Rams franchise until it was reported that the National Football League would not be allowing any franchise relocation for the 2015 season.[39]\n\n\nOn January 5, 2015, Stockbridge Capital Group, the owners of the Hollywood Park Land Company, announced that it had partnered with Kroenke Sports & Entertainment to add the northern 60-acre (24 ha) parcel to the rest of the development project and build a multi-purpose 70,240-seat stadium designed for the NFL.[40][41][35][42] The project would include the stadium and a performance arts venue attached to the stadium with up to 6,000 seats. The previously approved Hollywood Park development was reconfigured to fit the stadium, and included plans for up to 900,000 square feet (84,000 m2) of retail, 800,000 square feet (74,000 m2) of office space, 2,500 new residential units, a luxury hotel with over 300 rooms, 25 acres (10 ha) of public parks, playgrounds, open space, a lake, and pedestrian, bicycle, and mass-transit access for future services.[35][42] On February 24, 2015, the Inglewood City Council approved plans with a 5–0 unanimous vote to combine the 60-acre (24 ha) plot of land with the larger Hollywood Park development and rezone the area to include sports and entertainment capabilities. This essentially cleared the way for developers to begin construction on the venue as planned in December 2015.[43][44][45]\n\n\nIt was reported in early February 2015 that \"earth was being moved\" and the site was being graded in preparation for the construction that would begin later in the year.[46]\n\n\nThe project was competing directly with a rival proposal. On February 19, 2015, the Oakland Raiders and the San Diego Chargers announced plans for a privately financed $1.85 billion stadium that the two teams would have built in Carson if they were to move to the Los Angeles market.[47] The project was, like the Inglewood project, also approved to move forward and cleared for development.[48] The two projects spent the remainder of 2015 jockeying for the right to get approved by the NFL.[49]\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2016 aerial view of the stadium construction site, adjacent to The Forum. The new Hollywood Park Casino is in the foreground.\nThe NFL approved the Inglewood proposal and the Rams' relocation back to Los Angeles, 30–2, on January 12, 2016, over the rival proposal.[50] On July 14, 2016, it was announced that Turner Construction and AECOM Hunt would oversee construction of the stadium and that the architectural firm HKS, Inc. would design the stadium.[51] On October 19, 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) determined that a 110-foot (34 m) tall LB 44 rotary drill rig would not pose a hazard to air navigation, so it approved the first of several pieces of heavy equipment to be used during construction. The stadium design had been under review by the FAA for more than a year because of concerns about how the structure would interact with radar at nearby Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).[52] On December 16, 2016, it was reported in *Sports Business Journal* that the FAA had declined to issue permits for cranes needed to build the structure. \"We're not going to evaluate any crane applications until our concerns with the overall project are resolved,\" said FAA spokesman Ian Gregor.[53] The FAA had previously recommended building the stadium at another site because of the risks posed to LAX—echoing concerns raised by former United States Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge.[54] The Rams held the groundbreaking construction ceremony at the stadium site on November 17, 2016. The ceremony featured NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Rams' owner Stan Kroenke.[55][56] On December 23, 2016, the FAA approved the large construction cranes to build the stadium.[57]\n\n\nOn May 18, 2017, developers announced that record rainfall in the area had postponed the stadium's completion and opening from 2019 until the 2020 NFL season.[58][59] On August 8, 2017, the LA Stadium Premiere Center opened in Playa Vista, featuring interactive multimedia displays and models showcasing the design and features of the new stadium (with a particular focus on prospective buyers of premium suites and seats at the facility).[60][61]\n\n\nIn March 2018, the NFL announced that it would relocate its NFL Media unit (which manages the NFL's in-house media units, including NFL Network, digital properties, and NFL Films among other units) from Culver City to a new 200,000-square-foot (19,000 m2) facility neighboring the stadium in the Hollywood Park development including a studio capable of hosting audiences, as well as an outdoor studio. The new facility was completed in 2021.[62][63] On June 26, 2018, the new stadium was ceremonially topped out.[64]\n\n\nAs of August 2019, one year before the planned opening, Rams chief operating officer Kevin Demoff stated that the stadium was 75 percent complete.[65]\n\n\n\n![](image)The almost-completed stadium in July 2020\nIn January 2020, Demoff announced that construction was 85 percent complete, with roof and oculus work, as well as seat installation, still in progress.[66] In February 2020, a large crane collapsed—no one was injured.[67][68] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders issued by the California state government in March 2020, construction (exempted as a critical infrastructure project) continued with social distancing and heightened health and safety standards. Demoff acknowledged that there was a possibility that its completion could be delayed, explaining that it was \"not the time you want to be finishing a stadium, in this environment as you prepare\", but that \"our stadium, and I believe the Raiders' stadium as well, will both be amazing when they are finished and when they will begin play, which will certainly happen in the near future, whether that's in July, August, September, in 2021\".[69][70] Five construction workers were reported to have tested positive, including an ironworker who had worked in an assembly area away from the structure, and a backfill operator who had worked in an \"isolated area outside the building\" and had not entered it.[71][72] On June 5, 2020, construction on the facility was temporarily halted after an ironworker fell to his death through a hole in the roof created by the removal of a panel for maintenance.[73][74] On June 9, 2020, construction on the facility resumed everywhere but the roof.[75]\n\n\n\n### Cancelled or postponed opening events, first events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Interior of SoFi Stadium in November 2021\n![](image)SoFi Stadium during the day in March 2021\nThe entirety of the NFL preseason was also cancelled; the Rams held their first practice at the stadium on August 22, 2020.[76] On August 25, the Chargers and Rams announced that all games at the stadium would be held behind closed doors \"until further notice\".[77] An official ribbon-cutting ceremony was hosted on September 8, ahead of its first NFL event on September 13—featuring the Rams hosting and defeating the Dallas Cowboys 20–17 in the first Sunday Night game of the season.[78][79] The Chargers would have their first game at the stadium a week later, though they would fall to the Kansas City Chiefs 23–20. The first athletic contest with spectators present occurred on May 15, 2021, with LA Giltinis defeating Utah Warriors, 38–27, in a Major League Rugby match before 4,880 spectators.[80][81] The Los Angeles Rams hosted the Chicago Bears for the first NFL regular-season game at the stadium with fans in attendance on September 12, 2021, a 34–14 Rams win before a crowd of 70,445. A week later, the Los Angeles Chargers would hold their first regular season game at the stadium with fans in attendance, though they would fall to the Dallas Cowboys 20–17 before a crowd of 70,240. \n\n\nAll of the originally announced summer concerts at the venue were cancelled or postponed by the pandemic, including a two-night stop of Taylor Swift's Lover Fest on July 25 and 26, 2020 (originally announced as the stadium's grand opening and later cancelled, though she concluded the 2023 U.S. leg of The Eras Tour at the stadium), and tours by Guns N' Roses (2020 Tour, they would perform at nearby BMO Stadium instead), Kenny Chesney (Chillaxification Tour, though he would perform in 2022 at the stadium), Tim McGraw (Here on Earth Tour), Mötley Crüe, and Def Leppard (The Stadium Tour, though they would perform in 2022 at the stadium).[82][83][84] \nOn May 2, 2021, the stadium hosted its first major event with spectators present, the filming of the Global Citizen-organized concert special *Vax Live: The Concert to Reunite the World*, hosted by Selena Gomez and featuring Jennifer Lopez, Eddie Vedder, the Foo Fighters, H.E.R., J Balvin, and the Duke of Sussex, which aimed to promote COVID-19 vaccination.[85][86] \nAfter COVID-19 restrictions were eased, SoFi Stadium hosted its first in-person concert event by American DJ Kaskade on July 17. Mexican regional music group Los Bukis kicked off their reunion tour on August 27 and 28, filling the stadium to capacity.[87]\n\n\nOn November 27 and 28, and December 1 and 2, the stadium hosted Permission to Dance on Stage—LA, a run of four concerts by the K-pop group BTS.[88] The shows took in a gross of $33.3 million; *Billboard* reported them to be the highest-grossing concert engagement to ever be held in California, the second-largest in North America overall (surpassed only by a 10-show run at Giants Stadium by Bruce Springsteen), and the highest-grossing run of concerts at a single venue since 2012.[89]\n\n\nOn April 29, 2023, the stadium hosted its first ever Monster Jam event. Grave Digger would end up winning the overall event championship. Two months later, it was announced that the stadium would play host to Monster Jam World Finals 23 on May 18, 2024.\n\n\n\n## Naming[edit]\n\n\nOn September 15, 2019, it was announced that the San Francisco-based financial services company SoFi had acquired the naming rights to the new stadium under a 20-year deal valued at over $30 million per-year, a record for any naming rights for a sports venue.[90] The company became an official partner of both the Rams and the Chargers, as well as a partner of the performance venue and surrounding entertainment district.[91]\n\n\nThe covered open space formerly known as *Champions Plaza* between the playing field and the performance venue within the stadium was officially named American Airlines Plaza, as the airline has a hub at nearby LAX. The airline was named the first founding partner on August 6, 2019.[92]\n\n\nThe performance venue was officially named YouTube Theater (the company is based in San Bruno) on June 28, 2021.[93]\n\n\n\n## Funding[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium was built privately,[94] but as of 2015, the developer was seeking significant tax breaks from Inglewood.[95][*needs update*]\n\n\nAt the commencement of construction, the cost of the stadium was estimated at $2.66 billion. But internal league documents, produced by the NFL in March 2018, indicated a need to raise the debt ceiling for the stadium and facility to a total of $4.963 billion, making it by far, the most expensive sports venue ever built. Team owners voted to approve this new debt ceiling at a meeting that same month.[96] In May 2020, another $500 million in loans was approved by the NFL and the owners.[11] It is currently the most expensive stadium in the world at a cost of $5.5 billion.[97]\n\n\n\n## Teams[edit]\n\n\nThe St. Louis Rams were first to commit to moving to the stadium, as NFL approval for their relocation to Los Angeles was obtained on January 12, 2016. The approval, as part of a concession made by Kroenke to get the stadium project and Rams relocation approved, also gave the San Diego Chargers the first option to relocate to Los Angeles and share the stadium with the Rams, conditioned on a negotiated lease agreement between the two teams. The option would have expired on January 15, 2017, at which time the Oakland Raiders would have acquired the same option.[98]\n\n\nOn January 29, 2016, the Rams and the Chargers came to an agreement in principle to share the stadium. Both teams would contribute a $200 million stadium loan from the NFL and personal seat license fees to the construction costs and would pay $1 per year in rent to the facility's controlling entity, StadCo LA, LLC.[99][100][4] The same day, Chargers chairman and CEO Dean Spanos announced the team would remain in San Diego for the 2016 NFL season, while continuing to work with local government on a new stadium.[101] Measure C (the Chargers stadium proposal) did not receive the requisite number of votes required for passage.\n\n\nOn January 12, 2017, the Chargers exercised their option and announced plans to relocate to Los Angeles for the 2017 season, making the Chargers the second tenant at the stadium and returning them to the market where they played their inaugural season in 1960.[102][103] The Chargers exercising of their option led the Raiders to move to Las Vegas, Nevada, instead, and they began play at Allegiant Stadium in 2020.\n\n\nThe Rams' and the Chargers' move into the stadium marked the return of major professional sports to Inglewood for the first time since the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings left The Forum for Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles in May 1999.\n\n\n\n## Major events[edit]\n\n\n### NFL[edit]\n\n\n#### Super Bowl LVI[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pre-game warmups before Super Bowl LVI\nMain article: Super Bowl LVI\n\nSoFi Stadium hosted Super Bowl LVI on February 13, 2022, marking the first Super Bowl to be played in the Los Angeles area since Super Bowl XXVII in 1993. The stadium was originally awarded Super Bowl LV (2021) at an NFL owners' meeting in May 2016;[104][105] in May 2017, because the stadium's opening was delayed to 2020, the NFL chose to re-award Super Bowl LV to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa (which was the remaining city in a pool of four used to determine the hosts of Super Bowl LIII through LV), and award LVI to Los Angeles instead. Because issues may need to be addressed in an inaugural season, the NFL does not allow a stadium to host the Super Bowl during its first season of operation.[106]\n\n\nIn 2022, SoFi Stadium became the first stadium to host a conference championship game and the Super Bowl in the same year. With the Rams winning the 2021 NFC Championship Game, they became only the second team to play a Super Bowl in their home stadium, although the Rams were the away team, since the AFC (Cincinnati Bengals) was the designated home team. With the Rams' victory in Super Bowl LVI, it also became the second stadium to see its main tenant win the Super Bowl.\n\n\n\n### College football[edit]\n\n\n#### College Football Playoff National Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: College Football Playoff National Championship\n\n![](image)SoFi Stadium set up for the 2023 CFP National Championship Game.\nOn November 1, 2017, it was announced that the stadium would host the 2023 College Football Playoff National Championship.[107] The Georgia Bulldogs, winners of the Peach Bowl and TCU Horned Frogs, winners of the Fiesta Bowl played on January 9, 2023.[108] Georgia won 65–7, making it the largest margin of victory in any bowl game at the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) level.[109]\n\n\n\n#### LA Bowl[edit]\n\n\nMain article: LA Bowl\n\nThe Mountain West and Pac-12 conferences play a bowl game at SoFi Stadium known as the LA Bowl (officially known as the L.A. Bowl Hosted by Gronk). The conference tie-ins for the game moved from the Las Vegas Bowl.[110] The inaugural edition of the game in 2021 featured Utah State defeating Oregon State 24–13.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Winning Team\n | Losing Team\n | Attendance\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| December 18, 2021 | **Utah State** ![Utah](image) | 24 | ![Oregon](image) Oregon State | 13 | 29,896 | notes |\n| December 17, 2022 | **Fresno State** ![California](image) | 29 | ![Washington (state)](image) Washington State | 6 | 32,405 | notes |\n\n\n### High School football[edit]\n\n\nOn October 13, 2023, SoFi Stadium hosted its first high school football game between Downey rivals Warren High School and Downey High School, with the winner being invited to and honored at the 2023 LA Bowl. 18,000 people watched Warren defeat Downey 28–21.[111]\n\n\n\n### Soccer[edit]\n\n\nSoFi Stadium hosted a club friendly doubleheader on August 3, 2022, between two Major League Soccer clubs based in Los Angeles and two Liga MX clubs from Mexico: the Los Angeles Galaxy defeated Chivas Guadalajara 2–0; and Los Angeles FC lost in a penalty shootout against Club America. The event was sold out and was part of the Leagues Cup Showcase.[112][113]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Winning Team\n | Result\n | Losing Team\n | Event\n | Attendance\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| August 3, 2022 | **LA Galaxy ![United States](image)** | 2–0 | ![Mexico](image) Guadalajara | Leagues Cup Showcase | 71,189\n |\n| **Club América ![Mexico](image)** | 0–0 (6–5 pen.) | ![United States](image) Los Angeles FC |\n| July 16, 2023 | **Mexico ![](image)** | 1–0 | ![](image) Panama | 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup Final | 72,963\n |\n| July 26, 2023 | **Arsenal** ![England](image) | 5–3 | ![Spain](image) Barcelona | Club Friendly | 70,223\n |\n\n\n#### International matches[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium hosted the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup final on July 16, 2023. It was the seventh final held in the Los Angeles area. Mexico won 1–0 against Panama.[114]\n\n\n\n#### 2026 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2026 FIFA World Cup\n\nThe local bid for Los Angeles in the 2026 FIFA World Cup was organized by private businesses led by AEG with assistance from the Los Angeles Sports and Entertainment District Commission, Los Angeles FC, the LA Galaxy, and Rose Bowl Stadium. The Los Angeles City Council approved the bid after private businesses showed support and offered to pay hosting costs.[115] SoFi Stadium was initially not selected as a bidding venue in the winning Canada–Mexico–United States bid because the organizing committee left unbuilt venues out of its final evaluations.[116] The American bid to host the World Cup was selected by FIFA on June 13, 2018,[115] and SoFi stadium will host multiple matches during the tournament.[117] SoFi Stadium is one of sixteen venues set to host matches. It is also one of eleven US venues being used and is one of two venues in California which will host matches, the other being Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area. During the event, the stadium will temporarily revert to its planning name of \"Los Angeles Stadium\" in accordance with FIFA's policy on corporate sponsored names.[118]\n\n\nThe stadium lacks a regulation-sized soccer pitch due to its narrow width, which has been criticized by FIFA officials. To satisfy FIFA requirements, several field level seats would be removed and the turf surface replaced by a grass pitch.[119][120] In September 2023, Stan Kroenke threatened to pull hosting from the stadium until a dispute regarding revenue sharing between him and FIFA could be resolved.\n\n\n\n### WrestleMania[edit]\n\n\nMain article: WrestleMania 39\n\n![](image)WrestleMania 39 Night 1 at SoFi StadiumOn April 1 and 2, 2023, SoFi Stadium hosted WrestleMania 39, the 2023 edition of WWE's flagship professional wrestling event WrestleMania. It was the highest-grossing event in WWE history, with a reported gate of $21.6 million and a combined attendance of 161,892 fans over both nights.[121] SoFi Stadium was originally slated to host WrestleMania 37 in 2021,[122][123] but its hosting was deferred to 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic [124][125]\n\n\n### 2028 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2028 Summer Olympics and 2028 Summer Paralympics\n\nSoFi Stadium (which, per prior precedent, will be renamed for the duration of the Games according to sponsorship rules) will host the opening and closing ceremonies of 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympics (with organizers proposing a split format for the Olympics that would also incorporate the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum).[126] The stadium will also host archery and soccer (football).[127]\n\n\n\n### 2031 and 2033 Rugby World Cups[edit]\n\n\nLos Angeles is amongst the cities being considered for hosting matches during the 2031 Rugby World Cup and 2033 Women's Rugby World Cup.[128]\n\n\n\n### Concerts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Main act(s)\n | Opening act(s) / Guest(s)\n | Tour / Concert name\n | Tickets sold / available for\n | Gross revenue\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| May 2, 2021 | Performers\n* Foo Fighters\n* Eddie Vedder\n* Jennifer Lopez\n* J Balvin\n* H.E.R.\n* NCT 127\n* Saweetie\n* Picture This\n | — | Global Citizen - *VAX LIVE: The Concert to Reunite the World* | — | — | First major event with spectators present, which was invite only.[129] |\n| July 17, 2021\n | Kaskade | Deadmau5 | *Kaskade: Los Angeles* |  |  | First major event that was open to the public.[130] |\n| July 24, 2021 | Justin BieberChance the RapperJaden SmithTori Kelly | — | *The Freedom Experience* | — | — | [131] |\n| August 8, 2021 | The OffspringThe Maine | — | ALT 98.7's \"COME OUT AND PLAY\" | — | — | Part of Los Angeles Chargers FanFest.[132] |\n| August 27, 2021 | Los Bukis | — | Una Historia Cantada |  | $19,382,302 (2 shows) | First sold out musical act and Latin band show to perform at SoFi.\n |\n| August 28, 2021 |\n| October 14, 2021 | The Rolling Stones | Ghost Hounds | No Filter Tour | 81,676 / 81,676 (2 shows) | $18,887,679 (2 shows) | [133] |\n| October 17, 2021 | The Glorious Sons |\n| November 27, 2021 | BTS | — | Permission to Dance on Stage | 213,752 / 213,752 (4 shows) | $33,316,345 (4 shows) | [134] |\n| November 28, 2021 |\n| December 1, 2021 |\n| December 2, 2021 |\n| May 13, 2022 | Paul McCartney | -\n | Got Back | 43,658 / 43,658\n | $12,046,695\n | [135] |\n| May 28, 2022 | Grupo Firme | —\n | Enfiestados y Amanecidos Tour\n | —\n | —\n |  |\n| July 23, 2022 | Kenny Chesney | Dan + ShayOld DominionCarly Pearce | Here and Now Tour | 50,227 (100%) | $5,467,968 | Originally called the \"Chillaxification Tour\".[136] |\n| July 31, 2022 | Red Hot Chili Peppers | BeckThundercat | 2022 Global Stadium Tour | 46,902 (100%) | $8,560,363 | [137] |\n| August 27, 2022 | Mötley CrüeDef Leppard | PoisonJoan Jett and the BlackheartsClassless Act | The Stadium Tour | 43,210 (100%)\n | $6,192,352\n |  |\n| September 2, 2022 | The Weeknd | KaytranadaMike Dean | After Hours til Dawn Tour | 49,324 / 49,324\n | $11,132,108\n | [138] |\n| September 30, 2022 | Bad Bunny | Diplo | World's Hottest Tour | 99,816 / 99,816\n | $31,096,479\n | [139] |\n| October 1, 2022 |\n| November 26, 2022 | The Weeknd | KaytranadaMike Dean\n | After Hours til Dawn Tour | 97,691 / 97,691\n | $17,620,155\n | Originally scheduled for September 3 but was rescheduled due to loss of voice.[140] |\n| November 27, 2022 |  |\n| March 3, 2023 | Playboi CartiTravis ScottFutureLil Wayne | Performers\n* Kodak Black\n* Tyga\n* Trippie Redd\n* DaBaby\n* Saweetie\n* Lil Baby\n* Don Toliver\n* 2 Chainz\n* Kevin Gates\n* Lil Yachty\n* City Girls\n* Aminé\n* Chief Keef\n* Lil Uzi Vert\n* Polo G\n* Moneybagg Yo\n* Ski Mask the Slump God\n* Lil Tecca\n* OhGeesy\n* Sheck Wes\n | Rolling Loud |  |  | First music festival held at SoFi Stadium, duration of the event was 3 days and was held outside the stadium in the parking lot[141] |\n| March 4, 2023 |\n| March 5, 2023 |\n| March 10, 2023\n | Stevie NicksBilly Joel |  | Two Icons, One Night\n | 51,880\n | $10,884,917\n | [142] |\n| May 27, 2023\n | Grupo Firme |  |  |  |  |  |\n| June 3, 2023\n | Romeo Santos |  |  |  |  |  |\n| June 10, 2023\n | TWICE | —\n | Ready To Be World Tour | TBA\n | TBA\n | The first female act and the first girl group headliner to sell out a show at SoFi Stadium.[143] |\n| July 22, 2023\n | Morgan Wallen | HARDYErnestBailey Zimmerman | One Night At A Time World Tour\n | TBA | [144] |\n| August 3, 2023 | Taylor Swift | HaimGracie Abrams | The Eras Tour | TBA | This was the fastest-selling event in the stadium's history.

Hollywood Park consists of over 8.5 million square feet (790,000 m2) that will be used for office space and condominiums, a 12-screen Cinepolis movie theater, ballrooms, outdoor spaces for community programming, retail, a fitness center, a luxury hotel, a brewery, restaurants and an open-air shopping and entertainment complex.[146] Adjacent to the stadium is an artificial lake colloquially known as Rivers Lake,[147][148][149][150] with a waterfall and fountain. The YouTube Theater, which seats 6,000, is under the southeast corner of the stadium canopy.[151]\n\n\nThe first establishment to open in Hollywood Park was the Hollywood Park Casino, which opened on October 21, 2016.[18] The NFL opened a new west coast campus in a seven-story office tower at Hollywood Park next to the stadium on September 8, 2021. Replacing a facility in Culver City, it consists of 214,063 square feet (19,887.1 m2) of leased office space and a 74,992 square feet (6,967.0 m2) studio, and features 20 conference rooms, five soundstages and an outdoor studio. One of its main tenants is NFL Media—which operates NFL Films, NFL Network, NFL RedZone, and the league's digital properties from the building.[152][153] The league has also used the facility as a secondary hub for replay reviews.[154]\n\n\n\n## Public transportation [edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rams fans at Hawthorne/Lennox Station\nThe stadium is accessible from bus shuttles to two nearby Los Angeles Metro Rail lines: the C Line at Hawthorne/Lennox station and the K Line at Downtown Inglewood station. These shuttle services operate every five to eight minutes starting three hours prior to kickoff time, and continuing until ninety minutes after the game's conclusion.[155]\n\n\nA second game-day shuttle line, operated by the city of Gardena's GTrans municipal bus service, originates from the Harbor Gateway Transit Center in Gardena, traveling to SoFi Stadium, with connections to the C Line's Hawthorne/Lennox station.[156] SoFi Stadium is also accessible by Metro lines 115, 117, 211, 212, and Torrance Transit line 10.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe city of Inglewood and Los Angeles Metro began talks to build an 1.6 miles (2.6 km) automated people mover line that will connect the Downtown Inglewood K Line station with SoFi Stadium, as well as the Forum and the Intuit Dome, the future Los Angeles Clippers basketball arena just south of the Hollywood Park site. The Inglewood Transit Connector will be operated by the city, in conjunction with Metro, and is planned to open in 2027.[157]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* On September 9, 2020, the stadium's construction was the subject of a two-hour special called *NFL Super Stadiums* on Science Channel.[158]\n* In December 2021, the stadium was used as the venue for the Influencer Games, a YouTube Originals miniseries hosted by MrBeast (real name Jimmy Donaldson). The first video showed Donaldson put famous YouTubers and TikTokers against each other in a series of mini-games in various parts of the stadium complex, including in YouTube Theater.[159] After that, the second video showed the remaining contestants play a game of hide and seek around the entire complex.[160]\n* During the first LA Bowl at the stadium, YouTuber Mark Rober teamed up with a local 12 year old named Anthony Hartman to build the world's largest t-shirt cannon per request of Jimmy Kimmel, with all three launching it during the halftime show.\n* In February 2022, Dude Perfect, along with Mark Rober, hosted the 33rd episode of Overtime, a series by Dude Perfect at the stadium.\n* The stadium served as a filming location for part of the Starfleet Academy in Season 2 of *Star Trek: Picard*.[161]\n* The stadium was featured in Season 1, Episode 5 of *The Idol* and the episode was filmed during The Weeknd's show on September 2, 2022.[162]\n* YouTuber and comedian Tom Grossi concluded his 30 in 30 charity tour at the stadium and the nearby NFL Network Building in 2023.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\nPortal:* ![photo](image) Los Angeles\n\n* History of the Los Angeles Rams\n* History of the Los Angeles Chargers\n* History of the National Football League in Los Angeles\n* Intuit Dome\n* List of most expensive buildings\n* List of current National Football League stadiums\n* Kia Forum\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"City of Champions Stadium renderings - STADIAWORLD\".

It has served as the home venue for the National Football League (NFL)'s San Francisco 49ers since 2014. The stadium is located approximately 40 miles (64 km) south of San Francisco. It is named after Levi Strauss & Co., which purchased naming rights in 2013.\n\n\nIn 2006, the 49ers proposed constructing a new stadium at Candlestick Point in San Francisco, the site of their erstwhile home, Candlestick Park. The project, which included plans for retail space and housing improvements, was claimed to be of great potential benefit to the nearby historically blighted neighborhood of Hunters Point. After negotiations with the city of San Francisco fell through, the 49ers focused their attention on a site adjacent to their administrative offices and training facility in Santa Clara.\n\n\nIn June 2010, Santa Clara voters approved a measure authorizing the creation of the tax-exempt Santa Clara Stadium Authority to build and own the new football stadium and for the city to lease land to the authority.[13] A construction loan raised from private investors was secured in December 2011, allowing construction to start in April 2012.[7] Levi's Stadium opened on July 17, 2014.[7]\n\n\nLevi's Stadium was the site of the Pac-12 Football Championship Game from 2014 through 2019 before moving to Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. Previously, that game was played on the home field of the division winner possessing the better record.[14][15] Levi's Stadium hosted Super Bowl 50 on February 7, 2016, and will host Super Bowl LX in 2026.[16][17] Levi's Stadium also hosted the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship. Levi's Stadium will host multiple matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Stadium design[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium was designed by HNTB, an internationally renowned architectural firm, with a focus on creating a multi-purpose venue and with the fan experience and green technology as top priorities. Civil engineering work was performed by Winzler & Kelly, which was acquired by GHD Group in 2011. Commissioning services were provided by Glumac.\n\n\n\n### Basic stadium features[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Levi's Stadium in August 2014 during a 49ers game\nLevi's Stadium is designed as an open stadium with a natural grass field. It has a seating capacity of 68,500, expandable to approximately 75,000 to host major events like the Super Bowl and the FIFA World Cup. However, on June 27, 2015, The Grateful Dead Fare Thee Well Tour made history by extending the stadium to 83,000 in attendance. The seating design of the stadium places approximately two-thirds of the fans in the lower bowl, which is one of the largest of its kind in the entire NFL. The design features significantly improved accessibility and seating options for fans with special needs and disabilities when compared to the 49ers former home, the now-demolished Candlestick Park. The configuration is similar to Ford Field, home of the NFL's Detroit Lions, with the majority of the luxury suites on one side of the field, which puts the fans in the upper deck closer to the action.\n\n\nAs a multi-use facility, the stadium can be configured for special touring events including concerts, motocross events, indoor/outdoor conferences, and other community events. The stadium is also designed to meet the FIFA field geometry requirements for international soccer, which will allow it to host international friendly matches and major tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup. The stadium also features over 109,000 square feet (10,100 m2) of flexible premium meeting space in the club areas.[20]\n\n\n\n#### Stadium app[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium has created an in stadium app designed specifically for home football games for the 49ers to provide a better fan experience for fans and guests. The app can be downloaded for free from the App Store and Google Play. Features are limited on non-football game days or if one is outside the vicinity of the stadium. However, when having the app within the stadium on game and event days one has many options including in-seat delivery, live streaming, navigation and much more. The app can be extended to other events hosted by the stadium if the third party would like to include its features for their guests.[21]\n\n\n\n#### Issues with the turf[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium had repeated problems with the grass surface, including the grass collapsing under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker during a week 6 game in 2015.[22] This led to concern that the stadium wasn't of a high enough caliber to host a high stakes game such as the Super Bowl.[23] The problems with the turf were mentioned the day after the Super Bowl by Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib who said \"The footing on the field was terrible. San Fran (the 49ers) has to play eight games on that field, so they better do something to get it fixed. It was terrible.\"[24]\n\n\n\n### Environmental sustainability[edit]\n\n\nStadium proponents claim that the stadium is currently one of the largest buildings registered with the U.S. Green Building Council. It is also believed to be the first stadium that will have both a green roof and solar panels. The 49ers are exploring collaborative opportunities with the Environmental Protection Agency to explore environmentally friendly components including:[20]\n\n\n\n* Use of an outside commissioning agent to verify that energy‐related systems are installed, calibrated, and performing in compliance with the project requirements\n* Use of public transit nearby including VTA, ACE, Amtrak, with connection to a proposed future BART extension\n* Construction of a green roof (27,000± sf) and photovoltaic panels (20,000± sf)\n* Use of paving materials and roofing materials with a high solar reflectance index\n* Use of recycled water for landscape irrigation, toilets, and urinals along with water‐conserving fixtures\n* No use of CFC‐based refrigerants in the HVAC systems. Systems will instead use refrigerants that minimize compounds that contribute to ozone depletion\n* Installation of permanent monitoring systems that provide feedback on ventilation system performance\n* Diversion, recycling, and/or salvaging 75% of non‐hazardous construction waste\n* Use of controllable and programmable lighting control systems and thermal comfort control systems\n\n\nLevi's Stadium received a Gold LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certificate. It is the first professional football stadium in the United States to receive this certification as new construction.[25]\n\n\n\n### Rooftop farm[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2016, Levi's Stadium converted 6,500 square feet (600 m2) of the green roof to an organically maintained rooftop farm. The vision for this quarter-acre—named the Faithful Farm after the 49ers' loyal following—came from team CEO Jed York and his wife. Danielle York, a former science teacher, was particularly interested in a dedicated space that could help the building achieve some of its goals for sustainability. The first rooftop farm on an NFL stadium, Lara Hermanson and Matt Sandoval of Farmscape worked with the San Francisco 49ers to create the Faithful Farm. Herbs, tomatoes, peppers, zucchini, leafy greens and edible flowers are among the 40 rotational crops which are harvested for use in dishes served at Levi's Stadium in club spaces during games and at the more than 200 private events hosted at the stadium each year. As of 2019[update] the farm was undergoing expansion to add another 6,500 square feet (600 m2).[26][27][28][29]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\n#### Public transit[edit]\n\n\nStadium patrons have the option of riding VTA light rail (Valley Transportation Authority) to the stadium. The closest light rail station is the Great America station, which is located just west of the stadium in the median of Tasman Drive.\n\n\nTo the east, other transit options include the VTA Lick Mill station (also in the Tasman median) as well as the Amtrak and ACE station near California's Great America. VTA also offers dedicated shuttle bus service to the stadium from the Warm Springs BART station.[30]\n\n\n\n##### Nearby transit stations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Station name | Agency name\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Great America | VTA Light Rail |\n| Santa Clara - Great America | ACE |\n| Amtrak |\n\n\n#### Walking and bicycling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)San Tomas Aquino Creek next to Levi's Stadium\nLevi's Stadium was constructed immediately east of the San Tomas Aquino Trail, a paved multi-use path installed by the City of Santa Clara in 2004[31] that connects to a continuous 100-mile (160 km) network of off-street paths including the regional San Francisco Bay Trail. The city announced in March 2013 that the San Tomas Aquino Trail would be \"temporarily detoured between Agnew Road and Tasman Drive for approximately one year starting April 15 and ending when the Stadium is open,[32]\" but this one-mile section of the trail remained closed to the public before and during stadium events since they began in August 2014, requiring the continued use of the two-mile on-street detour.\n\n\nThe stadium project's Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) disclosed no such ongoing temporary closures of the trail, but stated instead that \"While there will likely be a sizeable increase in pedestrians on the San Tomas Aquino Creek trail before and after NFL events, the creek trail is open to both pedestrians and cyclists and there are no restrictions on use. Anyone at anytime can access and use the trail.\"[33]\n\n\n\n#### Vehicular access[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium's official mailing address is on Marie P DeBartolo Way (formerly Centennial Boulevard), which is actually a cul-de-sac on the east side of the stadium. The primary access route to the stadium is Tasman Drive, which runs along its northern side. Tasman is a major east–west arterial road which connects to Interstate 880 several miles to the east. Both west and east of the stadium, Tasman intersects with various north–south arterial roads which connect to several important freeways, such as California State Route 87, U.S. Route 101, California State Route 237, and Interstate 680. The closest and most important of those north–south roads is Great America Parkway to the west of the stadium, which is named after the theme park to the south.\n\n\n\n### Naming rights[edit]\n\n\nOn May 8, 2013, the 49ers announced that San Francisco-based Levi Strauss & Co. purchased the naming rights to the new stadium. The deal calls for Levi's to pay $220.3 million to the city of Santa Clara and the 49ers over 20 years, with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around $75 million.[34] On September 14, 2015, ESPN's Chris Berman coined the name \"The Big Bellbottom\" in reference to the stadium.[35] In a Deadspin article covering the 49ers on August 18, 2015, article writer Drew Magary coined the nickname \"the Jeanhole\" for the stadium.[36]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nLevi's Stadium has been praised for its excellent sightlines, beautiful architecture, plentiful amenities, technological advancements, convenient public transportation access, and environmental sustenance.[37] However, the stadium has been heavily criticized for its highly corporate atmosphere and lack of a football atmosphere that Candlestick Park had. With the stadium having the most expensive ticket prices in the league during its inaugural season, many long-tenured and loyal fans that had contributed to the football atmosphere at Candlestick Park could not afford to buy season tickets with the added cost of the Stadium Builders License. Additionally, with the distractions inside the stadium that include multiple bars and lounges, fans would often hang out in those places while the game is going on rather than watching the game from their seats.[38]\n\n\nLevi's Stadium has received some backlash from season ticket holders, who are unhappy regarding rules that won't allow them to print their tickets until 72 hours before the game, making re-sale very difficult.[39] In addition, older 49ers fans say that people are more segmented at Levi's Stadium in comparison to Candlestick Park, leaving tailgaters with large expanses of empty parking stalls and a more desolate tailgating experience.[40]\n\n\nPilots flying into San Jose International Airport have frequently complained of being blinded or disoriented by the lights from the light towers and scoreboards. The stadium is directly in the flight path of one of the airport's runways.[41] According to Bay Area NBC affiliate KNTV in 2016, there had been at least 43 complaints about the lights since the stadium opened.\n\n\nLevi's Stadium has also received heavy criticism for the way fans are treated on hot days during early-season afternoon games. The majority of fans are seated on the east side of the stadium and during these afternoon games, this side of the stadium is fully exposed to the elements due to the lack of overhangs. With the climate of Santa Clara being much warmer than San Francisco, it makes watching games on hot days uncomfortable for fans as they are less accommodated for exposure to the sun than are patrons at other stadiums in hot-weather climates. Several fans suffered heat exhaustion during preseason and early season afternoon games. This has led to the eastern stands being largely empty on hot days.[42] The stadium had been designed with the Candlestick Point site in mind and when the team decided to build it in Santa Clara instead, they kept the design intact in order to quickly get started on construction without taking the differences in climate into account.[43] Due to its close proximity to the airport, Federal Aviation Administration regulations do not allow the 49ers to add any more height to the stadium, while any additional overhangs would have to be structures, making it very difficult to fix the problem.[44]\n\n\n\n## Previous plans[edit]\n\n\nThe 49ers pursued a new stadium since 1997, when a plan for a stadium and a mall at Candlestick Point passed a public vote. When the plans failed to move forward, the San Francisco 49ers presented an alternative plan on July 18, 2006, to construct a new 68,500-seat, open air stadium as part of a mixed use development featuring housing, commercial and retail space. In November 2006, the team announced that plans for a new stadium at Candlestick Point were not feasible, \"citing extensive costs for infrastructure, parking accommodations and other changes that would cost more than the stadium itself\".[45] The 49ers turned their focus to making Santa Clara the home to their new stadium.\n\n\n\n### The 1997 plan[edit]\n\n\nSan Francisco voters in 1997 approved $100 million in city spending to build a new stadium and an attached shopping mall at Candlestick Point.[46] However, even after voter approval to grant economic help for the project, the stadium was not constructed. This was because owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. was facing legal troubles, which led him to surrender ownership of the team to his sister Denise DeBartolo York and brother-in-law John York. Mills Corporation, the company chosen by the 49ers, was unable to put together a plan to successfully construct a new stadium for the team.[47] NFL owners had gone as far as awarding the new stadium the rights to host Super Bowl XXXVII.[48] When stadium plans stalled, the game went to San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium instead.\n\n\nFor years, the city and team ownership were embattled over attempts to gain funding and a green-light for construction of a new stadium. None of these attempts proved to be successful.[49]\n\n\n\n### The 2006 plan[edit]\n\n\nThe city of San Francisco received a new incentive to get a new stadium built. Mayor Gavin Newsom wanted to bring the 2016 Summer Olympics to the city, and a new stadium would sweeten the city's proposal for selection by the United States Olympic Committee as the official US submission to the IOC. The announcement came in November 2006. It called for a new stadium that would be converted into a 68,600-seat stadium for the 49ers after the Olympics. The Olympic Village would be converted into low-income housing after the games were over.[50]\n\n\nThe new stadium was to be built at Candlestick Point on land just southeast of Candlestick Park. The cost of the stadium would be $916 million. Lennar would build housing, retail, and office space around the stadium area.[47] Originally, part of the area surrounding Candlestick Park was to be zoned for retail space and housing; the new 49ers stadium was to be combined with such elements, bringing much-needed attractions to the historically blighted neighborhood of Hunters Point.[51]\n\n\nThe stadium would be stocked with 150 luxury suites, 7,500 premium club seats, and an increased number of seats lower and closer to the field, called \"bowl seating\", potentially raising the 49ers franchise value up as much as $250 million and offering at least $300 million in advertising and concession deals, the majority of which from paid corporate naming.[52] The architectural design would be reminiscent of San Francisco buildings.\n\n\nThe project planning did not get off to a good start, however, with contention between the 49ers and the city of San Francisco over viable locations for the new stadium. Initially, the idea was to build a stadium in the parking lot of Candlestick Park and later demolish the aging stadium. Team ownership feared that construction of the village and the stadium would severely limit the amount of land available in Candlestick Point, creating a parking problem for fans and increasing traffic along the roads that link the stadium to the freeway. Moreover, with residents in the low-income housing by 2016, traffic would be permanently increased, further damaging the already-limited methods of transportation to the park.[53]\n\n\nWith San Francisco slow to come up with better locations for the stadium, or ways to circumvent the problems posed by construction at Candlestick Point, team owners Denise DeBartolo York and John York announced on November 9, 2006, that the 49ers were shifting their efforts to create a new stadium to the city of Santa Clara, home to the team offices and training facility since 1987, approximately 40 miles (64 km) south of San Francisco.[53]\n\n\nThe sudden removal of the planned stadium forced the San Francisco Olympics bid group to cancel its proposal, which engendered great anger not only from Mayor Newsom, but also from such 49ers legends as Joe Montana and Ronnie Lott, who were part of the effort to bring the Olympics to the Bay Area.[54] In addition, many fans were outraged at the suggestion to move the 49ers out of the city that it had shared history with for decades. The Yorks insisted that the legacy of the franchise would be respected in the sense that the 49ers would not be renamed nor moved out of the Bay Area.[49] This was met with much opposition from Mayor Newsom and Senator Dianne Feinstein (who was mayor of San Francisco between 1978 and 1988); the senator stated that the team should be unable to use the San Francisco name if its operations were not based in the city.[55] On January 3, 2007, California State Senator Carole Migden introduced a bill, entitled SB49, that would bar the 49ers from building a new stadium within a 100-mile (160 km) radius of San Francisco, if they were to leave the city. The 49ers organization announced its strong opposition to the legislation and retorted that passing such a bill would only encourage the team to move out of the Bay Area altogether.[56] The bill died without being acted upon.[57]\n\n\n\n## Santa Clara City Council negotiations[edit]\n\n\nThe Santa Clara stadium project had been in the works since 2007, with negotiations beginning in 2008. Two years later the following documents were produced that were key to understanding the stadium deal that went before the voters of Santa Clara on June 8, 2010. All documents cited below are publicly available on the City of Santa Clara's website.\n\n\n\n* Term sheet: Detailed agreement between the city of Santa Clara and the San Francisco 49ers about the financing, construction, operation, and eventual demolition of the stadium. Key points include: no new or increased city taxes or costs to residents; 49ers responsible for construction and operation cost overruns; and the city will continue to own the land and receive rent payments back to its general fund from the stadium.[58]\n* 49ers Stadium Proposal: A PowerPoint presentation given to the City of Santa Clara April 24, 2007.[59]\n* Study: Economic and Fiscal Impacts of a New State-of-the-Art Stadium in Santa Clara: This is a study conducted by Conventions Sports and Leisure (CSL). It highlights estimates of a new stadium's economic and fiscal impact on the City of Santa Clara and the region including the creation of new jobs and new economic activity.[60]\n* Environmental Impact Report: This document is part of the state-mandated California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process. It researches in depth all possible environmental impacts the stadium may have.[61]\n\n\nMost city council members in Santa Clara were extremely receptive to the possibility of a new stadium being constructed there for the 49ers. In 2009, the Santa Clara City Council, led by Mayor Patricia Mahan, along with city employees began negotiating in earnest with the team, who presented the city with stadium plans. On June 2, 2009, by a 5–2 vote, the Santa Clara city council agreed to preliminary terms (as detailed in a term sheet[62]). The official term sheet stated that the team's name would not change; the team would continue to be called the San Francisco 49ers even when the move to Santa Clara was complete.[63][64]\n\n\n\n## The campaign[edit]\n\n\n### Santa Clara stadium campaign[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2009, Cedar Fair Entertainment, Great America's owner, filed a lawsuit to stop the project from proceeding.[65] However, the lawsuit was dismissed in court.\n\n\nOn December 15, 2009, the Santa Clara City Council voted 5–2 to withdraw their city-sponsored ballot measure on the stadium issue in favor of a ballot initiative, Measure J.[66] The ballot initiative was voted on on June 8, 2010 and passed by 58% of Santa Clara voters.[67][68] Santa Clara City Council members William Kennedy and Jamie McLeod had opposed the stadium project and worked (unsuccessfully) to get Measure J defeated.[69]\n\n\n\n### Measure J: June 8, 2010[edit]\n\n\nMeasure J is a binding, voter-initiated measure that was approved by voters in the City of Santa Clara. All documents cited below are publicly available on the City of Santa Clara's official website.\n\n\n\n* Ballot Question: This is the question that was presented to voters:[70]\n\t+ Shall the City of Santa Clara adopt Ordinance 17.20 leasing City property for a professional football stadium and other events; no use of City General or Enterprise funds for construction; no new taxes for residents for stadium; Redevelopment Agency funds capped for construction; private party pays all construction cost overruns; no City/Agency obligation for stadium operating/maintenance; private party payment of projected fair market rent; and additional funds for senior/youth/library/recreation to City's General Fund?\n* Voter Ordinance: This city ordinance becomes law if Santa Clara voters approve Measure J.[71]\n\n\n### Election results[edit]\n\n\n\n\nMeasure J (June 8, 2010)[72]\n| Choice\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Referendum passed](image) **Yes** | **14,782** | **58.2** |\n| No\n | 10,505\n | 41.8\n |\n| **Total votes** | **25,133** | **100.00** |\n\n\n## Oakland Raiders as possible co-tenants[edit]\n\n\nThere was a possibility that the Oakland Raiders might share the stadium, allowing its costs to be split between the two teams.[73] The stadium is designed to accommodate two teams, with the exterior LEDs being programmable for alternate colors and two home-team locker rooms.[74] The 49ers[73] and Raiders[75] publicly said it would be an option if possible, while NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was strongly in favor of the two sharing a stadium.[76] Fans of both teams reacted negatively to the idea. The arrangement would have been similar to the New York Giants and New York Jets, who shared Giants Stadium from 1984 to 2009 and currently share its successor, MetLife Stadium.\n\n\nThe 49ers and Raiders sharing a stadium would not have been a first, as the two shared Kezar Stadium for part of 1960.[77] It would have also fulfilled the late Raiders owner Al Davis' goal of a new stadium, something he had strongly desired since the late 1980s although Davis was against sharing a new stadium with another NFL team in Los Angeles when the idea was proposed to him, prompting his move back to Oakland in 1995.[78][79]\n\n\nIn the wake of Davis' death, the possibility of the 49ers and Raiders sharing the stadium became a stronger possibility. However, by October 2011, the 49ers were far enough along on the stadium to have reportedly already sold over a quarter of the luxury suites, meaning the Raiders would be forced to be secondary tenants.[80] In October 2012, Oakland Raiders owner Mark Davis told reporters he had no plans to share the Santa Clara stadium with the 49ers. According to the report, discussions remained open, although Davis wanted to keep the team in Oakland, or a nearby site in Dublin.[81]\n\n\nWhen the stadium had its grand opening on July 17, 2014, Goodell mentioned to the live crowd that it would make a great home for the Raiders and that it was up for the team to decide whether or not it wanted to play there or build a stadium on the site of the Oakland Coliseum. While the 49ers remained open to sharing the stadium with the Raiders, the Raiders said that their personal preference was the Coliseum site.[82]\n\n\nOn February 20, 2015, the Raiders announced that they would be seeking a joint stadium in Carson, with the San Diego Chargers should they not receive public funding to replace the Oakland Coliseum, reducing the likelihood of the Raiders sharing Levi's Stadium with the 49ers.[83] In January 2016, after losing their bid to relocate to Los Angeles to the Los Angeles Rams, the Raiders withdrew their request to move to Los Angeles, and joint tenancy at Levi's again surfaced in general discussion.[74] However, in March 2017, the Raiders were approved for a move to Las Vegas for the 2020 season, with the new Allegiant Stadium under construction as their future home.\n\n\nLevi's Stadium was mentioned as a possible temporary home for the Oakland Raiders for the 2019 season before they relocate to Las Vegas. Santa Clara officials drew up plans for this possibility.[84] However, the Raiders signed a one-year lease extension for the Oakland Coliseum, with an option for a second year of construction if Las Vegas were to be delayed, ending any possibility of them playing at Levi's Stadium.[85]\n\n\n\n## Financing[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2011, the Santa Clara City Council voted for an agreement that calls for the city's Stadium Authority to borrow $850 million from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and U.S. Bank. This will cover most of the construction costs, with the remainder to be made up via funding from the NFL, a hotel tax and city redevelopment funds. Interest, fees and terms for this loan have not been disclosed.[86][87] The $850 million building loan, plus interest and fees will be assumed by the city's Stadium Authority, where additional interest and fees will be applied.\nOn February 2, 2012, NFL owners approved a loan to the 49ers of $200 million for use in constructing the new stadium, and to be taken from a new G-4 stadium loan fund.[88] Terms of the loan were not specified, but under the previous G-3 plan, money was repaid directly into the league's account from the borrowing team's share of gate receipts from road games.\n\n\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Levi's Stadium under construction, July 11, 2013\nConstruction began soon after funding for the stadium had been confirmed. The official groundbreaking took place on April 19, 2012.[7] On July 30, 2012, the first steel beams for the stadium were laid down.[89] The first seats in Levi's Stadium were installed on October 1, 2013.\n\n\nConstruction was halted on June 11, 2013, after a mechanic working on an elevator was struck by a counterweight and then fell down the shaft to his death.[90] Work resumed two days later after officials from the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) declared the site safe, but as of October 2013, the accident remained under investigation.[91][92]\n\n\nThe Santa Clara stadium was constructed on a city-owned parking lot on Tasman Drive, located adjacent to the north of California's Great America theme park and leased to Great America for overflow parking. As with Candlestick Park, there are relatively few amenities in the stadium's immediate vicinity for sports fans, besides the 49ers headquarters and training facility. The Santa Clara Convention Center is northwest of the stadium site and there are two hotels on Tasman Drive next to the convention center, but the closest significant concentration of hotels and restaurants is on the Mission College Boulevard corridor almost a mile to the south, on the other side of Great America.\n\n\n\n## Opening[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Levi's Stadium on August 2, 2014, hosting its first-ever game, a soccer match featuring the San Jose Earthquakes and Seattle Sounders FC.\nThe stadium opened on July 17, 2014.[93] It was originally scheduled to open on July 11, but was pushed back due to construction delays.\nThe first game played at the new stadium was a Major League Soccer match on August 2, 2014, where the San Jose Earthquakes defeated Seattle Sounders FC 1–0 before a crowd of 48,765. The inaugural goal was scored in the 42nd minute by Yannick Djaló.[94]\n\n\nOn August 17, 2014, the 49ers lost their first preseason game, 34–0, against the Denver Broncos at Levi's Stadium. One fan at the game collapsed due to the heat and had to be rushed to a local hospital, where he died.[95]\n\n\nThe first 49ers' regular-season game at the stadium was held during Week 2 on September 14, 2014, when the team hosted the Chicago Bears on *Sunday Night Football*.[96] The Bears won the game 28–20[97] in front of a 49ers home record attendance of 70,799.[98]\n\n\n\n## Weekdays and parking[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2013, stadium and 49ers' officials initially requested the NFL to not schedule any Monday or Thursday night home games during Levi's Stadium's inaugural season due to parking issues in the area surrounding the stadium during weekdays.[99] Two months later, in January 2014, the Santa Clara city government was able to secure more than the 21,000 necessary parking spots by approving use of the fairways at the city-owned Santa Clara Golf and Tennis Club (which is located to the north of the stadium across Tasman Drive). This arrangement is similar to and was modeled upon a longstanding arrangement between the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and the adjacent Brookside Golf Course, where the golf course was modified to allow for vehicular access to the fairways; they are used for parking only when dry to minimize damage, and any damage that does occur is repaired afterward.\n\n\nWith access to the golf course fairways, Levi's Stadium now had 31,600 potential parking spaces, meaning that tailgating and weeknight games were now a possibility. However, the NFL decided not to schedule any weeknight home games at Levi's Stadium in 2014 until traffic flow within the area is figured out, with the exception of a Thanksgiving game between the 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks on November 27, 2014. Parking prices, which averaged $30 in the 49ers' final season at Candlestick Park, will increase to $40 at Levi's Stadium.[100]\n\n\nAnticipating significant traffic from Levi's Stadium visitors, the nearby city of Mountain View instituted a three-hour parking limit on downtown streets during game days. While residents received exemptions via permit tags, stadium-goers must park in paid lots or far from Mountain View's Caltrain/VTA light rail station. This station is the closest VTA light rail station to San Francisco and receives transferring passengers heading south to San Jose via light rail (including people using the light rail to go directly to the Levi's Stadium station).[101]\n\n\nIn Spring 2015, 49ers' officials offered the city of Santa Clara $15 million to take over the adjacent Santa Clara Youth Soccer Park and convert these soccer fields into additional parking lots. This money, along with a large percentage of parking fees, would have then been used for the city to build a new youth sports complex elsewhere.[102] The plan was opposed by the youth soccer leagues that use the fields, and critics calling it a \"land grab\".[103] After many youth soccer players attended a city council meeting on April 29 to protest the proposal, the 49ers withdrew the $15 million offer.[104] The team then gave the city an unsolicited offer of $3 million to help improve various youth athletic fields and facilities, which was cited as a peace offering by *San Francisco Chronicle* columnists Phil Matier and Andrew Ross, and other Bay Area media,[105] but the city council turned the offer down.[106]\n\n\n\n## Other events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Super Bowl 50 at Levi's Stadium\n### Super Bowl 50[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Super Bowl 50\n\nSuper Bowl 50 was held at the stadium on February 7, 2016.

Located at the north side of False Creek, it is owned and operated by the BC Pavilion Corporation (PavCo), a crown corporation of the province.\n\n\nThe venue is currently the home of the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League (CFL), Vancouver Whitecaps FC of Major League Soccer (MLS), the annual Canada Sevens (part of the World Rugby Sevens Series), as well as the BC Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\nOpened on June 19, 1983, BC Place was originally an indoor structure with an air-supported roof, the world's largest at the time.[6][7] Following the 2010 Winter Olympics, it was closed for 16 months as part of an extensive revitalization, the centrepiece of which was replacing the inflatable roof with a retractable roof supported by cables. Once construction was completed, the stadium's new roof was also the largest of its type.\n\n\nBC Place was the main stadium for the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics, the 2012 CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament, as well as a venue for multiple matches including the championship match for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. The stadium is set to host multiple matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, estimated to cost $240-260 million in staging, planning and hosting.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Opening and 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Exterior view of BC Place from the south, with its original roof, October 2005\nConstruction of the stadium started in 1981, with Dillingham Construction contracted to build the stadium, designed by architecture firm Studio Phillips Barratt, Ltd.[5] BC Place was built as part of the preparations for the 1986 World's Fair, Expo 86. Upon its completion in 1983, the stadium, designed by structural engineers Geiger Berger Associates,[5][9] was the world's largest air-supported domed stadium until May 4, 2010, when it was deflated for the last time in preparation for the erection of its new retractable roof. Its original air-supported design was similar to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which was home to both the Minnesota Twins Major League Baseball team and the Minnesota Vikings National Football League team.\n\n\nThe stadium held its grand opening on June 19, 1983.[6][7] The first major event held in the stadium came the next day, June 20, when the Vancouver Whitecaps hosted the Seattle Sounders in a Monday night North American Soccer League (NASL) game with attendance announced at 60,342.[10][11] On June 23, 1983, the BC Lions played their first game at the new stadium, a preseason 41–19 victory against the Calgary Stampeders with 53,472 in attendance.[12] A month later, on July 24, 1983, a crowd of 41,810 watched the BC Lions defeat the Saskatchewan Roughriders 44–28 in the Lions' first regular season game at the stadium.[13] The venue would host the Soccer Bowl '83 and the 1983 Grey Cup game later that year.[14][15][16] On September 18, 1984 Pope John Paul II addressed an over-capacity crowd for \"A Celebration of Life\". The celebration was part of the papal visit to the Archdiocese of Vancouver. It was one of the most heavily attended events in the stadium. The Pope's Celebration of Life was followed a few months later by the Canadian Pacific Billy Graham Crusade, which drew similar numbers each night.\n\n\nThe stadium was then used for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1986 World Exposition on Transportation and Communication (Expo '86). Accepting an invitation by the Province of British Columbia, their Royal Highnesses Prince Charles and Princess Diana made themselves available to take part in the opening ceremonies. To great fanfare, they officially proclaimed the World's Fair open on May 2, 1986. In 1987, an exhibition match of Australian rules football was played at the stadium and drew a crowd of 32,789  – a record for the largest AFL/VFL crowd outside of Australia. The stadium also held an NFL exhibition game in 1998 when the San Francisco 49ers beat the Seattle Seahawks 24–21 in the American Bowl.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nInside BC Place Stadium under original roof in July 2005\n\n### 2007 roof deflation[edit]\n\n\nOn January 5, 2007, snow accumulated on the air-supported Teflon Fibreglass roof, despite strict zero accumulation of ice guidelines and ice accumulation structural warnings. The accumulation caused a tear in the roof's ETFE-coated fabric close to Gate G on the south side where the roof meets the top of the concrete bowl.[17][18] The tear grew quickly as air escaped through it, whereupon maintenance staff performed an intentional, controlled deflation to protect the integrity of the roof's intact fabric panels.[19] As it was designed to do, the deflated roof rested on its steel support cables 6 metres (20 ft) above the seating and the field. Normally, the roof had a rise of 27 metres (90 ft) above the top of the bowl when inflated.[20] No one was injured during the incident, although rain and melted snow flooded the bowl and subsequently had to be pumped out.\n\n\nAn independent report indicated that an accidental rapid pressurization combined with lightly gusting wind and a location of previously undetected damage caused the tear.[21] The damaged panel was replaced with a temporary one on January 19 and the roof was re-inflated.[22][23] The BC Contractors Association held an exhibition in the stadium over the week of January 23,[24] during which the roof leaked in several places when it rained.[25] The temporary panel was successfully replaced with a permanent one in June 2007, just prior to the start of the 2007 CFL season.[26]\n\n\n\n### Renovation and roof replacement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Renovation works at BC Place, including the construction of the retractable roof, viewed in April 2011\n![](image)Exterior view of the stadium after its renovation, November 2014\nOn May 16, 2008, it was announced that over $150 million in major renovations would be carried out on BC Place Stadium. The work was done in two phases. The first phase involved upgrades to seating, washrooms, concessions, and luxury suites, as well as the reinforcement of the existing ring beam at the top of the building[27] and was completed in October 2009, in time for the 2010 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nWork on the retractable roof began in May 2010, with PCL Westcoast Constructors Inc. contracted to construct the roof designed by architecture firm Stantec Architecture Ltd. and structural engineering firm Geiger Engineers, with Schlaich Bergermann & Partner serving as consulting engineers and Genivar, Inc. acting as services engineers.[28] Geiger also designed the stadium's new centre-hung scoreboard.[28] The roof's construction began immediately after the completion of the 2010 Winter Paralympics and the final deflation of the air-supported roof. The official budget for the completed Phase 1 upgrades plus the revitalization project was $514 million.[29] The new roof, a cable-supported retractable roof system first used with the Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt, Germany,[30] is the largest of its kind.[31] The opening measures 100 by 85 metres (109 by 93 yd), the same size as the field below. The fabric roof retracts into and is hidden by a pod in the centre of the opening, above the suspended videoboard.[32]\n\n\nThe updated stadium also features the second largest centre-hung high definition scoreboard in North America, after the one in AT&T Stadium.[33] In addition, a new artificial turf developed by Polytan was installed at an estimated cost of $1.2 million. It is designed to achieve FIFA 2-star certification, the highest rating possible. The soccer pitch is 117 by 75 yards (107 by 69 m).[34]\n\n\nTSN analyst and former CFL player Chris Schultz praised both the design and engineering of the new stadium.[33] Columnist Brian Hutchinson has praised the renovations for significantly improving the acoustics, and providing a bright and airy feel to the stadium. These were aspects that were missing in its previous air-supported roof incarnation, as well as the Montreal Olympic Stadium and the Rogers Centre (formerly SkyDome).[31]\n\n\nThe artificial turf installed between September 2011 and April 2015 drew criticism, notably its lacklustre characteristics for playing professional level soccer.[35][36] A new artificial turf was installed in May 2015, prior to the FIFA Women's World Cup Canada 2015. The total cost of the turf upgrade was $1.327 million, with Canada Soccer and Rugby Canada contributing $500,000 CDN to the project.[37] Liam Middleton, Canada's Rugby Sevens coach, stated that the new surface was \"better than some natural grass surfaces they've played on.\"[38]\n\n\n\n#### Summary of renovations[edit]\n\n\n* New retractable roof is the largest cable supported retractable roof in the world.[39][40]\n* Revolving doors replaced with clear glass doors, which allows the stadium to be accessed much more easily.[41]\n* Old brown glass around building replaced with light green glass which lets more light in and makes stadium brighter.[41]\n* BC Lions locker room completely expanded and refurbished: Old lockers were taken out, sanded down, refinished, and put back in. New cubicles were also put in with individual lighting for players. Locker room also sports a new floor called \"sport floor\".[41]\n* New synthetic turf, called Polytan LigaTurf RS+, was installed as the new playing surface. Turf has a 1+1⁄4 inches (32 mm) thick shock pad underneath the turf and special eco-friendly BionPro infill.[42]\n* A centre-hung high-definition scoreboard measuring 68 by 38 feet (21 m × 12 m).[42]\n* Around the stadium is a new 51 inches (1.3 m) electronic ribbon board, with a circumference of 2,200 feet (670 m).[39]\n* Added 1,140 new HDTV screens. Screens work through a system called Stadium Vision. Each screen runs on a separate video source, allowing menu boards at concourse concession stands to show game updates to fans as they order from concession stands.[43]\n* All concourses widened and refurbished.[41]\n* Added 140 additional portable concession stands. Storage of food and supplies will be in concession stands.[43]\n* 50 fully refurbished private suites and 1,300 newly refurbished premium Club Seats.[44][45][46]\n* Wheel chair seating now at every price point and level of the stadium.[39]\n* New upgraded washrooms, and access ramps with new lighting.[47]\n* New state of the art sound system.[39]\n* New wider seats: seats or 20 inches (51 cm) wide with cup holders on every seat.[39]\n* New sport lighting in stadium: 10% of lighting replaced by hot strip lighting, which gives instant on and off.[39]\n\n\n### Post-renovation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)BC Place during the opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics\n![](image)Scene inside BC Place prior to the start of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup Final\nThe opening and closing ceremonies of the XXI Olympic Winter Games and the opening ceremonies of the X Paralympic Winter Games were also held in BC Place Stadium in February and March 2010, respectively. The stadium was the first air-supported structure and 24th venue to host the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics. It was also both the third CFL venue and the third Canadian venue to have served as an Olympic Stadium, after Montreal's Olympic Stadium and Calgary's McMahon Stadium.\n\n\nThe 47th Vanier Cup was the first Canadian university football championship paired with the Grey Cup Festival and played Friday, November 25, 2011, between the McMaster Marauders and Laval Rouge et Or in front of 24,935. Nicknamed \"Best Game... Ever\",[48] it is widely regarded as one of the most exciting Canadian Football games of all time[49] with McMaster winning 41–38 in double overtime. It was the first championship played in the newly renovated facility.\n\n\nThe 2012 CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament final between the United States and Canada played at the stadium was the highest attendance for a women's CONCACAF Olympic Qualifying game with 25,427 people in attendance.[50]\n\n\nThe 2014 NHL Heritage Classic took place March 2, 2014, in BC Place, with the Ottawa Senators facing off against the home team Vancouver Canucks.[51] It was the first of the NHL's \"outdoor\" games to be played in what technically is an indoor stadium, albeit one of a larger capacity than a typical NHL arena.\n\n\nBC Place hosted its second major international sports competition, the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. Five group stage matches, two round of 16 matches, and one quarter-final were held in the stadium during June 2015, and the Final between Japan and the United States was played here on July 5, 2015.[52]\n\n\nThe stadium hosted round six of the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series 2015–16 series.[53]\n\n\nA new overall attendance record was set on September 2, 2023, with 65,061 people attending an Ed Sheeran concert, surpassing the previous record of 63,803 set by a U2 concert in 2009.[3]\n\n\nBC Place will host several matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup as one of two Canadian venues.[54]\n\n\nBC Place will host three shows for Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour on December 6, 7, and 8, which will be the first act at the stadium to schedule three shows on a single tour.\n\n\n\n## Tenants[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Interior scene at BC Place during a 2011 Major League Soccer season match between the Vancouver Whitecaps FC and Real Salt Lake\nBC Place's main sports tenants are the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and Vancouver Whitecaps FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). The Vancouver Nighthawks, a member of the World Basketball League, played the 1988 season at BC Place.[55]\n\n\n\n### Canadian football[edit]\n\n\nThe Lions have played at BC Place since it opened in 1983 and had a record attendance of 59,478 for three games in 1985 and 1986.[56] When it was built, the floor of BC Place was too small to accommodate a full-sized CFL regulation field, as a result BC Place became the first CFL stadium to use a 20-yard end zone instead of the regulation 25-yard end zone then in use. Although controversial at first, the smaller end zone proved highly popular with players and was adopted league-wide in 1986.[57]\n\n\nThe stadium has hosted the CFL's championship game, the Grey Cup, nine times: in 1983, 1986, 1987, 1990, 1994, 1999, 2005, 2011, and 2014. Notable was the 1994 championship, in which the hometown BC Lions defeated the U.S. expansion team the Baltimore Football Club on a last-second field goal by Lui Passaglia, preventing the Grey Cup trophy from leaving Canada (Baltimore would win the Grey Cup the following year). The stadium hosted the 99th Grey Cup in 2011 after the new roof was completed (this Grey Cup game was also won by the BC Lions at home).[58]\n\n\n\n### Soccer[edit]\n\n\nSeveral incarnations of the Whitecaps have played at BC Place. The original Vancouver Whitecaps of the North American Soccer League (NASL) played at the stadium from 1983 to 1984, when the team folded.[59] The team hosted the first sporting event at BC Place, a regular season match against the Seattle Sounders on June 20, 1983, which drew 60,342 spectators.[56] Soccer Bowl '83 was also held at BC Place, where the Tulsa Roughnecks defeated the Toronto Blizzard 2–0.\n\n\nThe stadium was also used for exhibition matches as well as Canada national team fixtures during the 1980s and 1990s. The second incarnation of the Whitecaps, initially named the Vancouver 86ers, played exhibition matches at BC Place in 1991 and 1992 before returning for regular season games in 1995 during renovations to Swangard Stadium.[60] On November 7, 2007, the Whitecaps hosted the LA Galaxy for an exhibition match that drew 48,172 spectators—mainly attracted by the appearance of David Beckham.[61]\n\n\nAfter the Whitecaps joined MLS and moved into the renovated BC Place, the team only sold seats in the lower bowl. They drew a record of 27,683 spectators for a regular season match against Seattle Sounders FC in 2018 without opening the upper bowl.[56] The restriction was lifted for a 2023 playoff match against Los Angeles FC on November 5, 2023; the match had 30,204 spectators.[62]\n\n\n\n### Baseball[edit]\n\n\nBC Place was also built in a baseball configuration to attract a future Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise.[63] It can accommodate a baseball diamond with retractable seating sections making room for right field. The Vancouver Canadians of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League played several series of games there between 1984 and 1988, including games 1 and 2 of the 1985 league championship series. Numerous MLB spring training games were also played, including in 1984 (Toronto Blue Jays and Milwaukee Brewers), 1986 (Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Montreal Expos and Seattle Mariners), 1993 (Toronto, Seattle, Milwaukee and Detroit Tigers) and 1994 MLB season (Toronto, Seattle, Montreal and Colorado Rockies).[64] The Mariners explored plans to play regular season games at BC Place in the mid-1990s,[65] but were unable to receive approval from MLB.[66][67]\n\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the stadium was planned to be the home of the yet-to-be named Vancouver team, a charter franchise of the United League (UL) which was planned to be a third league of MLB; it never came to fruition.[68][69]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An Expo Line SkyTrain pulling into Stadium–Chinatown station, located adjacent to BC Place\nThe stadium is served by two SkyTrain stations on two lines: the Expo Line (TransLink)'s Stadium–Chinatown to the East, and the Canada Line's Yaletown–Roundhouse to the west. TransLink also operates several bus routes that stop near BC Place.[70] The False Creek Ferries and Aquabus also serve the stadium, docking at the nearby Plaza of Nations.\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\n* Project of the Year for the 2012 International Stadium Business Awards[71]\n* National Council of Structural Engineers Associations' 2012 Outstanding Project Award in the Forensic/Renovation/Retrofit/Rehabilitation Structures category[72]\n* One of the 2012 Awards of Excellence presented to GENIVAR and Geiger Engineers by the Association of Consulting Engineering Companies, Canada[73]\n* The 2013 ENR Global Best Project Winner for Sports/Entertainment[74]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Canadian Football League stadiums\n* List of Major League Soccer stadiums\n* List of soccer stadiums in Canada\n\n\nPortals:* ![flag](image) Canada\n* ![](image) Olympics\n* ![icon](image) Association football\n* ![](image) Sports\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Pacific Rim Suites - BC Place\".

Located in the city's SoDo neighborhood, it is the home field for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL), Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS), the Seattle Sea Dragons of the XFL, and OL Reign of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). Originally called **Seahawks Stadium**, it was renamed **Qwest Field** in June 2004 when telecommunications carrier Qwest acquired the naming rights. The stadium became known as **CenturyLink Field** following Qwest's June 2011 acquisition by CenturyLink and was nicknamed \"The Clink\" as a result;[4] it received its current name in November 2020 with CenturyLink's rebrand to Lumen Technologies.[5] It is a modern facility with views of the Downtown Seattle skyline and a seating capacity of 68,740 spectators for NFL games and 37,722 for most MLS matches. The complex also includes the Event Center which is home to the Washington Music Theater (WaMu Theater), a parking garage, and a public plaza. The venue hosts concerts, trade shows, and consumer shows along with sporting events. Located within a mile (1.6 km) of Downtown Seattle, the stadium is accessible by multiple freeways and forms of mass transit.\n\n\nThe stadium was built between 2000 and 2002 on the site of the Kingdome after voters approved funding for the construction in a statewide election held in June 1997. This vote created the Washington State Public Stadium Authority to oversee public ownership of the venue. The owner of the Seahawks, Paul Allen, formed First & Goal Inc. to develop and operate the new facilities. Allen was closely involved in the design process and emphasized the importance of an open-air venue with an intimate atmosphere.\n\n\nSeahawks fans at Lumen Field have twice claimed the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar at an outdoor stadium, first at 136.6 decibels in 2013, followed by a measurement of 137.6 decibels in 2014. The crowd's notorious noise has also contributed to the team's home field advantage with an increase in false start (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) and delay of game (failure of the offense to snap the ball prior to the play clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams.[6] The stadium was the first in the NFL to install a FieldTurf artificial surface. Numerous college and high school football games have also been played at the stadium, including the 2011 Apple Cup and all Washington Huskies home games during the renovation of Husky Stadium in 2012. The XFL's Seattle Dragons began playing at Lumen Field in 2020 and returned in 2023 as the Sea Dragons.\n\n\nLumen Field is also designed for soccer. The first sporting event held included a United Soccer Leagues (USL) Seattle Sounders match. The USL team began using the stadium regularly for home games in 2003. The MLS expansion team, Seattle Sounders FC, began its inaugural season in 2009 at the stadium. Lumen Field was the site of the MLS Cup in 2009 and 2019; the latter set a new attendance record for the stadium with 69,274 spectators. The venue also hosted the 2010 and 2011 tournament finals for the U.S. Open Cup as well as the second leg of the 2022 tournament final for the CONCACAF Champions League; the Sounders won all three finals, with new tournament attendance records set for each final (or leg) hosted at Lumen Field. The stadium hosted several CONCACAF Gold Cup matches across multiple editions, and the Copa América Centenario in 2016. It will also host matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which was awarded to the United States, Canada, and Mexico.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Funding[edit]\n\n\nThe Seahawks played their home games at the Kingdome from their 1976 inaugural season until 1999, sharing the stadium with Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners and the National Basketball Association's Seattle SuperSonics.[8] In 1995 a proposal was made to issue county bonds to fund a remodeling project of the facility. The proposal failed, and as a result, Seahawks' owner Ken Behring threatened to sell or move the team (likely to Los Angeles). In 1997 local billionaire Paul Allen pledged to acquire the team if a new stadium could be built and said that the team could not be profitable until they left the Kingdome. He asked the state legislature to hold a special statewide referendum on a proposal to finance a new stadium. Allen also agreed to cover any cost overruns.[9][10] With Allen agreeing to pay the $4 million cost, the legislature agreed. The vote was scheduled to be held in June 1997 but in May a Seattle resident filed a lawsuit that claimed the legislature did not have authority to call for such a vote, since it would be paid for by a private party who could gain from the result. The case was delayed until after the vote.[11] The proposal was pitched to voters as providing both a new home for the Seahawks and a venue for top-level soccer. It passed on June 17, 1997,[12] with 820,364 (51.1%) in favor and 783,584 against.[11][13] The vote was close in Seattle, but it received 60% approval in Seattle's northern and eastern suburbs. The public funding was unpopular farther away in the eastern portion of the state.[14] In October, a Thurston County Superior Court judge ruled that the legislature acted properly and in the public's interest, and he dismissed the pending lawsuit. The Washington Supreme Court upheld the decision that December.[11][15]\n\n\nVoter approval of the referendum created a public–private partnership.[12] The Washington State Public Stadium Authority was created to oversee public ownership of the stadium, exhibition center, and parking garage complex. Allen purchased the Seahawks and formed First & Goal Inc. to build and operate the facility. The budget for the project was $430 million. Of this cost, $44 million was allotted to build the Event Center, $26 million for the parking garage, and $360 million for the stadium. First & Goal was to cover cost overruns and pay up to $130 million of the project while the contribution from the public was capped at $300 million.[16] The public funding package included new sports-related state lottery games, taxes on the facility's admissions and parking, sales tax credits and deferrals, and an eight-year extension of the 2% tax on hotel rooms in King County.[17] The taxes on admissions and parking were set below the authorized 10% to preserve the tax-exempt status of the project's bonds, but the percentage was increased to the full amount when the bonds were completely paid in 2021. Since then, they have served as dedicated funding sources for maintenance and modernization of the facilities.[16]\n\n\nIn September 1998, First & Goal signed a 30-year stadium lease that includes options to extend for another 20.[18] Per the agreement, the Public Stadium Authority receives $850,000 a year from First and Goal (adjusted for inflation), and First & Goal keeps all revenue from the stadium and parking garage. The company receives 80% of the revenue from the exhibition center while the other 20 percent is allotted to a state education fund. First & Goal is responsible for all operating and maintenance costs, expected to be $6 million a year, and must keep the facility in \"first-class\" condition. Other details of the lease include the availability of affordable seats, a coordinated effort with neighboring T-Mobile Park (the Mariners' current ballpark) to prevent gridlock, a provision for naming rights, the investment in public art at the stadium, and the giveaway of a luxury suite to a fan each Seahawks' game.[18]\n\n\n\n## Construction and layout[edit]\n\n\n![A stadium under construction with two cranes positioned where the field will eventually be installed. The terraced seating sections rise above the partially complete concourse levels, and half of the roof is in place.](image)The stadium under construction in 2001\nThe architectural firm Ellerbe Becket, in association with Loschky, Marquardt and Nesholm (LMN) Architects of Seattle, designed the 1.5 million square feet (140,000 m2) project. Allen was closely involved during the design process. While growing up he attended games at the University of Washington's (UW) outdoor Husky Stadium. His goal was to create a similar experience and atmosphere at the new venue.[19][20] The exhibition center portion of the project was designed over a period of 14 months by LMN Architects while First & Goal managed the construction.[21][22] Town meetings were held to discuss the impact on the public, and the company created a $6 million mitigation fund for nearby neighborhoods.[23] In accordance with a program established by the building team, contracts totaling $81 million were awarded to minority- and women-owned businesses. Union apprentices made up 19% of the workforce through another program with local trade unions.[24]\n\n\nConstruction of the new exhibition center and parking garage was set to commence on September 19, 1998, but prolonged lease discussions between First & Goal and the Public Stadium Authority delayed the official groundbreaking to September 28.[25][26] The exhibition center opened on October 30, 1999, and subsequently hosted its first event on November 4.[27] On March 26, 2000, to make way for the stadium, the Kingdome was demolished in the world's largest implosion of a single concrete structure.[28] Almost all of the Kingdome rubble was recycled with roughly half used for the new stadium. The designers were challenged by the soft soil at the site since it was a tidal marsh until public works projects in the early 20th century adjusted the waterline of nearby Elliott Bay. The top layer is a soft fill taken from the grading projects that had leveled portions of Seattle's hills. To account for the soft soil, the complex sits on over 2,200 pilings driven 50 to 70 ft (15 to 21 m) below the ground to form what is essentially a pier for the foundation.[29] Eight individually connected sections were built to account for the soil concerns, temperature effects, and the potential for earthquakes.[30] The adjoining exhibition center and parking garage are separate structures and are not part of the eight-section stadium.[30]\n\n\n\n![The stadium from the air on a clear day. SEAHAWKS STADIUM is painted on the white partial roof. The stadium is surrounded by roads and buildings.](image)The stadium after completion in 2002\nThe site of Lumen Field is the smallest of those developed for new NFL stadiums, at 30 acres (12 ha).[31][32] The upper levels were cantilevered over the lower sections to fit within the limited space. Along with the angle of seats and the placement of the lower sections closer to the field, this provided a better view of the field than typically seen throughout the country and allowed for a 67,000-seat capacity.[33] Space is available to increase the total capacity to 72,000 for special events. Included in the capacity are 111 suites and over 7,000 club seats. The stadium has 1,400 seats for those with disabilities and their companions located in various sections.[33] In 2009, Qwest Field ranked 21st out of the 31 stadiums in the NFL for total seating capacity.[34]\n\n\nThe configuration of Lumen Field is a U-shape with an open north end to provide views of downtown Seattle and the large north plaza. The large retractable roof of T-Mobile Park along with Mount Rainier to the southeast can be seen from the partially open south end.[31] The stadium's concourses were built to be wide, and they provide additional views of the surrounding area.[35] A 13-story tower was erected at the north end of the stadium that visually complements the Seattle skyline.[36] The tower features a vertically oriented scoreboard which is the first of its kind in the NFL. At the base is bleacher seating for 3,000 called the \"Hawks' Nest\". Another addition not previously seen in the NFL are field-level luxury suites located directly behind the north end zone.[31]\n\n\n\n![Two stadiums in an industrial area. Both have roofs with large arched trusses.](image)The roofs of Lumen Field and T-Mobile Park\nAllen rejected plans for a retractable roof during the early stages of the stadium's design. The lack of a retractable roof made it open to the elements, provided better views, and reduced the total cost of the project.[31] The roof, at 200,000 sq ft (19,000 m2),[37] covers 70% of the seats but leaves the field open.[24] The roof spans 720 ft (220 m) between concrete pylon supports at the north and south ends of the stadium. Its two expansive sections are held from below by trusses.[38] From above, two arches with additional supports rise 200 ft (61 m) over the field.[37] Post-tensioned cables were used to achieve its final shape and positioning.[39] To minimize damage in the event of an earthquake, the roof has a friction pendulum damper system. This disconnects the roof from the support pylons so that it can move independently of the structure. The technology had never been applied to a large-scale roof before Lumen Field.[30] A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the Seattle area during construction. The structure responded as expected by the designers, and there was minimal damage.[39] The project was completed on budget and a month ahead of schedule.[38]\n\n\nThe roof was originally painted white to aesthetically distinguish it from both T-Mobile Park and the nearby industrial area;[36] however, the paint gradually turned ash gray despite cleanings and repaintings, prompting a blue-colored repaint of the roof from May to July 2010.[40][41] Light-emitting diodes following the outline of the stadium's logo were subsequently installed on the roof in October 2019.[42] The east side of the stadium has a large glass curtain wall that faces the nearby International District. The exterior of the stadium also consists of salmon-colored concrete, and the west side of the structure is partially clad with red brick. The coloring and facade were designed so the stadium would blend with the older buildings in neighboring Pioneer Square. To reduce costs, the exterior was not completed with brick or ornate steel work.[31]\n\n\nIn 2015, the stadium was expanded with the addition of the Toyota Fan Deck[b] on 5,775 square feet (536.5 m2) of space at its southern end; privately funded by the Seahawks, it consisted of a new 12 Flag raising platform flanked by two 500-seat sections, pushing the capacity of the stadium to 68,000. The 1,000 additional seats were made available to then-current season ticket holders, with remaining seats allocated to the Blue Pride waiting list for season tickets.[44][45] The stadium also has additional seats that can be deployed for special events, bringing the maximum capacity to 72,000.[46]\n\n\nLumen Field underwent minor renovations in 2022 as the stadium marked its twentieth anniversary. Improvements to the stadium made before the start of the 2022 Seahawks season include the conversion of an unused 6,300-square-foot (590 m2) space below the Hawks' Nest into a food and beverage area, the addition of an open cashierless concession area on the concourse behind the Toyota Fan Deck, and the replacement of a pair of video display boards at the north end of the stadium with Diamond Vision boards from Mitsubishi Electric that are more than double the size of the pre-existing ones.[47] Additional renovations planned for 2023 and 2024 include the creation of two standing room open-air decks and a hospitality area adjacent to the home team's locker room for spectators to view players walking between it and the field.[48]\n\n\n\n## Surface[edit]\n\n\n![A stadium with a soccer pitch at dusk. The lower tier is filled with people.](image)The stadium prior to a Sounders match on FieldTurf\nThe 1997 state referendum stated that the stadium would feature a natural grass surface, but FieldTurf was not an option when the stadium was originally presented to voters according to the Public Stadium Authority.[49] Seahawks management reconsidered the playing surface after the Seahawks played on FieldTurf at Husky Stadium during the 2000 and 2001 seasons. Artificial turf was installed because it was easier to maintain than natural grass. The potential damage to a natural grass field caused by Seattle's frequent rain also made the surface an appealing option.[31] In order to keep a grass surface robust under heavy football use during late fall and early winter rains, a $1.8 million irrigation and heating system would have been required.[50] The coach of the Seahawks at the time, Mike Holmgren, said that FieldTurf installation was the right decision and stated that \"the players love it, and I think this surface will offer a better product on the field for the fans.\"[51] Local soccer fans were concerned that the lack of a natural grass field would hinder Seattle's chances of receiving an MLS expansion franchise.[50] They asserted that voters had approved the facility with the understanding that the new stadium was intended for soccer as well as football.[51] In a compromise, First & Goal agreed to pay for grass to be installed for special events when needed.[52]\n\n\nIn 2002, Seahawks Stadium became the first stadium in the NFL to install a FieldTurf artificial field.[19] The surface is made of plastic fibers rooted in a mixture of ground rubber and sand.[50] The field was replaced in early 2008 after tests showed that compression of sand and rubber increased the risk of player injuries. For the second installation, FieldTurf won the bid over Polytan. For the replacement surface, a one-inch (two and one-half centimeters) poured rubber foundation was added to prevent the compression from reoccurring. Under the naming rights agreement, Qwest paid $500,000 for the installation and First & Goal paid the remaining amount, which was undisclosed.[52] By 2010 the FieldTurf's quality had decreased with the blades becoming matted down. It also failed FIFA's quality testing to be ranked 2 Star. A new FieldTurf surface was laid down in 2012 and it met the requirements of a 2 Star field after testing.[53] A new turf field, using the FieldTurf Revolution 360, was installed in February 2016 ahead of the 2016 Sounders season.[54]\n\n\nThere have been various opinions regarding both the artificial surface and temporary grass surfaces used for soccer matches. After the Brazilian national team defeated Canada's side 3–2 in 2008, Brazil's coach commented that one reason for his team's unexpectedly poor performance was the loosely installed grass field.[55] The Grenada national team struggled to cope with the artificial surface during their loss at the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.[56] In July 2009, the U.S. Soccer Federation chose D.C. United's RFK Stadium over Qwest Field for the U.S. Open Cup. The general manager of D.C. United speculated that RFK's grass field was one of the reasons his team had a stronger bid.[57] The general manager of the Sounders, Adrian Hanauer, told *The Seattle Times* in 2010 that replacement of the surface was a continuing conversation between the Sounders and Allen's Vulcan Inc.[58] When the Los Angeles Galaxy traveled to Seattle in May 2012, the FieldTurf was noted as one of the reasons David Beckham and Robbie Keane were left out of the line-up.[59] In 2014, the field was criticized during an ESPN broadcast after an Amazon corporate event involving a game of Quidditch damaged the pitch before a Sounders match.[60] Zach Scott expressed concerns over the same installation of the field and its effects on his body. The 10-year lease extension between Sounders FC and First & Goal announced in 2015 mandates new turf every four years or sooner; the first such new installation was in 2016.[61][62]\n\n\nBetween August and November, both the Seahawks and Sounders FC host games at Lumen Field. Each team has emphasized the importance of playing their games without the other team's painted lines on the field.[63] Around 2003, at the Seahawks' request, local company EcoChemical developed for the field a new kind of paint that is \"designed to fail\". The new paint is relatively easy to remove with a power washer and a special chemical solution, a process that the company describes as environmentally friendly. With the new paint, converting the field between American football and soccer takes 14 hours in dry weather, though painting logos and other colors takes additional time.[64] Despite various preparations, some Sounders matches—particularly in the playoffs—have had Seahawks logos and American football lines painted on the turf.[65]\n\n\n\n## Football[edit]\n\n\n### Seahawks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Seattle Seahawks\n\n![A stadium filled with spectators with two football teams on the field between a play.](image)A regular season game for the Seahawks in 2016\nPrior to the stadium opening in 2002, Allen and Bob Whitsitt said that they hoped the new stadium would help turn the Seahawks into a Super Bowl contender and that Seattle would be considered to host the championship game.[19] The seating is expandable to 72,000 for the purpose of holding the game, but the NFL typically does not consider cities with outdoor stadiums where the average temperature in February is below 50 °F (10 °C).[66] The number of season tickets available at Qwest was capped at 61,000 following the Super Bowl appearance. The ensuing waiting list was the first for the Seahawks since the early 1990s.[67]\n\n\nThe team's first season at their new home was in 2002.[c] Their first game at the new facility was a 28–10 preseason loss to the Indianapolis Colts on August 11, 2002.[69] They went on to end their first season at the new field with a 7–9 record. In the 2003 season, the team went undefeated at home and reached the playoffs. It was the first time the franchise had won 10 games in a single season in 17 years.[70] The Seahawks again reached the postseason during the 2004 season and played their first playoff game at Qwest Field on January 8, 2005. In that game, they lost to the St. Louis Rams who had already defeated them twice that season.[71] The following season, the Seahawks went undefeated at home for the second time in three years and won their first-ever NFC Championship,[72] but lost in Super Bowl XL. Between 2002 and 2005, the Seahawks won 24 of their 32 regular season games at the stadium.[73]\n\n\nIn 2006, the Seahawks had a 9–7 record and hosted the Dallas Cowboys in the wild card round of the playoffs.[74] The Seahawks trailed 20–13 with less than 7 minutes remaining but came back to win 21–20.[75] In 2007, the team won seven of their eight home games and clinched their fourth consecutive division title.[76] Qwest Field was again the site for their wild card game, and they defeated the Washington Redskins 35–14.[77] In 2008, the Seahawks went 4–12 and had only two home wins. Holmgren left the organization after the season.[78] When he was interviewed about memorable moments and the fans, he said that Qwest Field was \"a remarkable place to compete in and to play professional football\".[79] He called a game at the stadium \"an experience\".[79]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Seahawks were the first NFL team with a losing record ever to win a division title in a season not shortened by a strike.[80] Seattle earned its fifth consecutive home playoff victory with a 41–36 win over the New Orleans Saints. \"God bless the voters,\" defensive tackle Craig Terrill said after the game in reference to the stadium's importance to the franchise.[81]\n\n\nUnder Pete Carroll, the Seahawks were undefeated at home during the 2012 season.[82] Season tickets for 2013 sold-out with a franchise-record 98% renewal rate.[83] Through the 2018 season, the Seahawks compiled a regular season record of 95–41 at the stadium.[84]\n\n\nLumen Field often sells out for Seahawks games; although the team struggled to sell out games (with two resulting blackouts)[d] in its inaugural season at the stadium, it has sold out every game after the 2003 home opener,[85][86] with 146 consecutive games sold out through the 2019 season.[87][e] Despite dismal on-field performances in 2008 and 2009, the team maintained its base of season ticket holders;[89] Before the 2008 season, the 14,000 single game tickets not already allotted sold out less than 15 minutes after they became available.[90] After going 9–23 over two seasons in 2008 and 2009, the number of available season tickets was increased to 62,000.[67] The largest crowd to attend a Seahawks game at Lumen Field was 69,190, against the Philadelphia Eagles on November 20, 2016.[87]\n\n\n\n#### Home field advantage[edit]\n\n\nLumen Field has earned a reputation as one of the loudest stadiums in the NFL. It was, at one point in time, in the Guinness World Record books for being the loudest stadium in the world.[6][91][92] The seating decks and partial roof, both trap and amplify exceptional amounts of noise and reflect it back onto the field.[93] This noise possibly contributes to increased false start penalties since opposing offenses can miss audibles and the snap count, as well as delay of game penalties due to the reduced efficiency of communicating plays to the offense.[73][94] From 2002 through 2012, there have been 143 false-start penalties on visiting teams in Seattle, second only to the Minnesota Vikings.[95] During that same time period, the Seahawks have accumulated a home win record of 59–29, with a simultaneous road record of 33–55.[96]\n\n\n\n![A blue flag with a white number 12 flies against a clear sky. An expansive white roof truss is behind the flagpole.](image)The 12th Man flag and a portion of the roof's support truss\nWhen Tod Leiweke was hired as the Seahawks' new CEO in 2003, he had a large flagpole installed in the south end to fly the 12th Man Flag as a tribute to the team's fans, collectively known as the 12th man.[97][98][f] The team had retired the number 12 in 1984 to honor its fans, who had gained notoriety for intensifying the Kingdome's noisy acoustics such that the NFL enacted a rule in 1989 penalizing home teams for disruptive crowd noise when visiting teams are on offense; the rule itself is rarely enforced due to the futility of controlling such noise leaguewide.[6][101] A local celebrity, sometimes a former Seahawk, raises the flag during the network television pre-game events.[102]\n\n\nIn 2005, the stadium gained national attention when the visiting New York Giants committed 11 false start penalties.[94][103] Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren attributed the penalties to the enthusiasm and noise from the crowd. He dedicated the ball used to make the game-winning field goal to the fans, and it is now displayed at the stadium.[104] The Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, asked an NFL senior vice president whether the Seahawks had broadcast artificial crowd noise over the public address system during this game.[105] The NFL sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season about such complaints and sent officials to monitor two games.[93] Holmgren denied the allegations, and the crowd responded by being even louder than usual when the Giants returned to Qwest Field.[105][106] Since 2005 the Seahawks have tracked the number of false starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate the crowd. As of 2013, the stadium has had a league-high number of false starts since.[107][108][109] In preparation for the 2005 NFC Championship Game at Qwest Field, the Carolina Panthers practiced with the recorded sounds of jet engines in the background to prepare for the volume of the crowd.[110]\n\n\nKickers experience further disadvantages when attempting field goals at Lumen Field. Both the stadium's proximity to Puget Sound and the open north end create winds that are challenging to gauge.[94] Former Seahawks kicker Josh Brown adjusted to the winds, and he believed the moisture in the air caused trouble for others.[111]\n\n\nOn September 15, 2013, Seattle Seahawks fans successfully broke the Guinness World Records for the loudest stadium in the world. The 131.9-decibel record occurred during the sack of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in the first quarter.[91] Fans then broke their new record during the third quarter of the same game when a level of 136.6 decibels was achieved during a goal line stand by the Seahawks defense.[112] The record was broken by the crowd at Arrowhead Stadium on October 13, 2013, with a sound pressure level of 137.57 decibels.[113] The record was later regained by the Seahawks fans on December 2, 2013, with 137.6 decibels against the New Orleans Saints, but lost once again to Arrowhead Stadium in a Monday Night Football game between the Kansas City Chiefs and New England Patriots on September 29, 2014, setting the record that still stands at 142.2 decibels.[114]\n\n\n\n### XFL[edit]\n\n\nThe Seattle Dragons (now the Sea Dragons) of the XFL played their only two home games at CenturyLink Field during the short-lived league's 2020 season. The team was among seven in the XFL to share its stadium with NFL teams and drew a league-record 29,172 fans at the home opener on February 15, 2020.[115][116] The second game had 22,060 in attendance, with the team among the highest-drawing in the XFL before the league suspended operations in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.[116][117] The renamed Sea Dragons resumed play in 2023 at Lumen Field, holding its first home game on February 23.[118][119]\n\n\n\n### College[edit]\n\n\n![In an American football game, a runner with the ball faces a defender while a blocker locks with another defensive player.](image)Washington hosting Air Force in 2005\nLumen Field has hosted several college football games. The hometown Washington Huskies played their 2005 season opener against the Air Force Falcons at the stadium in Tyrone Willingham's first game as head coach.[120][121] The Huskies played their entire 2012 home schedule at the stadium while their home field, Husky Stadium, underwent a $250 million renovation; to expedite the start of the renovation by three weeks, the Huskies and the Washington State Cougars also played the Apple Cup in 2011 at then-CenturyLink Field.[122]\n\n\nFrom 2002 through 2014, the stadium hosted a Washington State Cougars' non-conference home game each season (except for 2010). This included the 86th \"Battle of the Palouse\" against the Idaho Vandals in 2003.[123] The attendance for the dozen Cougar games ranged from 30,927 to 63,588.[124][125][126] CenturyLink Field is approximately 300 miles (480 km) from WSU, but closer to many alumni in the Seattle metro area. The university's athletic director said that an attendance of 50,000 was needed to make it worth moving the game from Martin Stadium in Pullman.[127] The Cougars went 6–6 in their annual Seattle home game, which generated additional revenue that was invested in facilities for the football program while also increasing exposure to the western side of the state.[128]\n\n\nIn April 2009, it was proposed that the annual Apple Cup between the Seattle-based Huskies and the Pullman-based Cougars be hosted at CenturyLink Field for six years beginning in 2010. The two programs could not reach an agreement on how to divide tickets. Pullman's business community had expressed concerns that playing the game away from the Palouse would be detrimental to the local economy.[129]\n\n\nQwest Field hosted the second and final Seattle Bowl in late 2002, in which Wake Forest beat Oregon 38–17.[130] The inaugural Seattle Bowl was played a year earlier at Safeco Field, but the game was discontinued when organizers could not secure financing before 2003. Later attempts to revive the Seattle Bowl were unsuccessful.[131] The Seattle Sports Commission led a push in 2008 for a new bowl game starting in 2010 that would have been a fundraiser for Seattle Children's Hospital.[132]\n\n\nLower division NCAA teams have played at the stadium throughout the years. From 2003 to 2008, the Division II football teams from Western Washington University and Central Washington University met each year in a rivalry game called \"The Battle in Seattle.\" Central won all but the 2004 game, and each meeting attracted more than 11,000.[133] Western (of Bellingham) discontinued its football program after the 2008 season, but Central (of Ellensburg) agreed to continue the series with Western Oregon University (of Monmouth) for games in 2009 and 2010. \"Battle in Seattle VII\" saw Central make a comeback to win 23–21 in front of 5,374.[134]\n\n\nOn October 31, 2009, the Division I FCS Eastern Washington University Eagles played a home game in Seattle for the first time. Along with the goal of drawing alumni from the metropolitan area, the athletic directors from both Eastern Washington (of Cheney) and Washington State had expressed the importance of connecting with alumni at receptions and other events on the western side of the state.[124][135] Billed as the \"Showdown on the Sound\", the game was a 47–10 victory over the Portland State Vikings.[136][137] According to Eastern's athletic director, Qwest Field's rental was $50,000 for the day.[138] The stadium subsequently hosted a game on September 11, 2010, between Eastern and Central; coined the \"Battle of the Sound\", the game saw Eastern prevail over Central 35–32.[139]\n\n\n\n### High school[edit]\n\n\nLumen Field has been used for high school football. The Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) puts on the annual Emerald City Kickoff Classic at the stadium. The event is a season-opening series of games between some of the best teams in the state.[140] The WIAA approached the Seahawks regarding use of the stadium for their high school football state championship games after moving them out of the Tacoma Dome in 2019, but the latter declined and recommended using Husky Stadium instead, noting that they were unable to match the offer terms from UW's athletic department.[141]\n\n\nThe stadium features a meeting between one of the best teams in Washington and one of the best from another state in the \"Best of the West\" game. On September 4, 2004, Washington's Bellevue High School and California's De La Salle High School played in front of over 25,000, a state high school event attendance record. Bellevue ended De La Salle's national-record 151-game winning streak in a 39–20 win.[142] On September 16, 2009, Bellevue defeated another highly regarded California school at Qwest Field in a 30–16 victory over Long Beach Polytechnic. *USA Today* had recently rated both teams highly with Long Beach third and Bellevue at 16th in the nation.[143]\n\n\nAfter the organizer of the event announced a match-up between Washington's Skyline High School and Oregon's Jesuit High School in 2009, he said that he proposed the possibility of televising games to Fox Sports, but Fox did not televise the game.[144] Skyline went on to shut out Jesuit 17–0 during that year's Emerald City Classic.[145]\n\n\nWithin Lumen Field, a large art piece called *The State of Football* pays tribute to high school football in the state of Washington. The piece features a depiction of Washington and holds replica football helmets from every high school football team in the state. The installation is part of the Stadium Art Program commissioned through First & Goal's lease of the facility, costing nearly $1.75 million.[18]\n\n\n\n## Soccer[edit]\n\n\n![The grandstand of a stadium filled with people. The stadium has distinctive trusses for support.](image)The stadium with its upper tier open before an exhibition match between Seattle and Barcelona\nLumen Field is also designed for soccer.[19] The stadium meets FIFA sight line requirements and provides separate locker rooms for soccer teams. Camera locations were chosen for optimal television coverage of the sport.[146] Numerous exhibition games have taken place at Lumen Field, including high-profile clubs such as Manchester United, Barcelona, Celtic, Real Madrid, Chelsea, Club América and Chivas de Guadalajara. These games have proved to be highly popular, and the first sell-out of 66,772 fans at the stadium was a soccer match between Manchester United and Celtic.[147] National teams such as Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, and China have played exhibition games at the stadium. The artificial turf has been temporarily overlaid with grass for international matches.[50][148]\n\n\nSeattle was the site of the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup Group B opening round between the national teams of the United States, Costa Rica, Canada, and Cuba. Two matches of the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup opening round were also played at the stadium on July 4, 2009. In the second match, the United States comfortably defeated Grenada, who were playing in their first major international competition, 4–0.[56] The Gold Cup returned in 2013 with Panama beating Martinique and Mexico defeating Canada in opening group play matches.[149] CenturyLink Field also hosted three matches during the 2016 Copa América Centenario, a special inter-continental tournament, including two group stage fixtures and a quarterfinal match between the United States and Ecuador attended by 47,322 spectators.[150][151]\n\n\nOn November 22, 2009, Seattle was the site of the 14th annual MLS Cup between Real Salt Lake and the Los Angeles Galaxy, where Salt Lake won the Cup on penalty kicks (5–4) in front of 46,011.[152][153] The stadium was the eighth venue to host the event and had the fourth-largest attendance for an MLS Cup.[154][155] The MLS Cup returned to Seattle in 2019, with the Sounders hosting Toronto FC as the higher seed. The Sounders won in front of 69,274 spectators, setting a new record for a sporting event at Lumen Field and recording the second-highest cup attendance in league history.[156]\n\n\n\n### 2026 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\nLumen Field was among the 58 facilities in the United States being considered for FIFA World Cup matches had the country's bid for the tournament in 2018 or 2022 been successful.[157] When discussing Seattle as a candidate, Sunil Gulati of the U.S. Soccer Federation called it \"a world-class facility\".[158] Seattle finally hosted a World Cup qualifier on June 11, 2013; the qualifier, which was the city's second overall and the first since 1976, saw the United States top Panama 2–0 in front of a raucous crowd of 40,847.[159][160] The United States will co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup with Canada and Mexico; Lumen Field was one of the 23 finalist venues named by the organizing committee in 2018 after the bid was awarded by FIFA.[161]\n\n\nLumen Field was subsequently announced as one of the 11 American venues, as well as one of five current MLS venues selected to host matches in June 2022; together with BC Place in Vancouver, both will be the only host venues based in the Pacific Northwest out of 16 total.[162][163] Under preliminary plans by the city government, it would cost up to $10.5 million to host the World Cup matches, including installation of a temporary grass surface, policing the venue and practice fields, and managing a fan festival at the Seattle Center or on the city's waterfront.[164] During the event, the stadium will be temporarily renamed to \"Seattle Stadium\" in accordance with FIFA's policy on corporate sponsored names.[165]\n\n\n\n### Sounders (USL)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Seattle Sounders (1994–2008)\n\nThe first sporting event at the stadium was a double-header on July 28, 2002, that included both the Sounders Select Women and the men's Seattle Sounders of the USL team. The women defeated the Vancouver Breakers 4–3, while the men beat the Vancouver Whitecaps 4–1 in front of 25,515 people.[166] The USL team began using the facility regularly as their home field in 2003. Although team management was concerned with the high rent and the underused seating capacity, they were drawn by the sponsorship opportunities and location. The Sounders increased their average attendance from 2,583 at Seattle's Memorial Stadium in 2002 to 3,452 at the new stadium in 2003.[167] In 2005, the Sounders beat the Richmond Kickers 2–1 in a penalty shootout for the USL championship in front of 8,011. Scott Jenkins scored the final goal and announced his retirement after the game.[168]\n\n\nIn 2008, the MLS expansion franchise Sounders FC decided to develop the Starfire Sports Complex in nearby Tukwila, and the USL team played most of the season at that facility. At the time, team management thought that practicing and playing at Starfire could provide a better transition for those hoping to play for the new MLS team.[169] The last match for the USL Sounders at Qwest Field was the 2008 season opener against the rival Portland Timbers. The game ended in a scoreless draw in front of 10,184.[170]\n\n\n\n### Sounders FC[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Seattle Sounders FC\n\n![A stand of a stadium with fans holding a large banner depicting the Space Needle. Green and blue flags wave throughout the stand and the flags of different nations are held by people on the field.](image)The south end of the stadium before the Sounders FC inaugural match\nThe potential to draw an MLS expansion team helped drive public support for building the stadium in 1997.[171] In 1996, Seattle was considered for one of the 10 original MLS teams; however, the region lacked an adequate outdoor stadium.[172] In 2007, it was announced that Seattle would be the home of an expansion team. The first Sounders FC regular season match was at the stadium on March 19, 2009. Fredy Montero scored the first goal in a 3–0 Seattle victory.[173]\n\n\nBefore the opening of their first season, the Sounders already had the highest number of season ticket holders in the MLS after they sold all 22,000 of the offered season ticket packages.[174] The team created a web site that was used to identify seating arrangements for season ticket holders based on personal interests including preferred method for watching a game and foreign team preference.[175] For the first half of the inaugural season, the upper and lower sections were tarped off, limiting the seating capacity to 27,700.[176] The club hoped to create an intimate environment as well as a supply-and-demand factor that would reward season ticket holders and encourage early purchase of seats.[177] The stadium has continuously sold out league matches in the limited seating configuration. However, majority owner Joe Roth has said that he \"won't be happy\"[178] until the entire venue is open.\n\n\nThe stadium was designed to easily open seating sections in stages if needed. After repeated sellout crowds, additional sections were opened, increasing total capacity to 32,400.[179] In the Sounders' first year they set an MLS record with an average home attendance of 30,943 people.[180] Official capacity was increased to 35,700 after the 2009 season.[181] In 2011, The Sounders continued to hold the highest average attendance in the league with 38,496.[182] Official capacity was increased again to 38,500 with the opening of the Hawk's Nest for the 2012 season.[183] The team averaged 44,247 spectators in the 2015 MLS season, its all-time record.[184][185] As of 2019[update], the regular season MLS capacity at Lumen Field is listed as 37,722 seats, with four matches scheduled to use larger sections of the stadium.[186]\n\n\n\n![The field and surrounding seats with pre-game pageantry on the field.](image)A regular season match for the Sounders in 2017, seen prior to kick-off\nThe Sounders set the state's single game soccer attendance record when they hosted Manchester United in front of 67,052 in July 2011.[187] On October 15, 2011, additional seats were available for a record crowd of 64,140 during the final regular season home match, a Sounders 2–1 win followed by ceremonies honoring retiring goalkeeper Kasey Keller.[188] And on October 7, 2012, another attendance record was broken when 66,452 fans were present for a 3–0 win over the Portland Timbers, following a ceremony awarding retired Forward Roger Levesque a Golden Scarf.[189] The Sounders set an attendance record for sporting events at the stadium of 69,274 when Seattle hosted the 2019 MLS Cup Final against Toronto FC, winning 3-1 for their 2nd MLS Cup trophy.[190]\n\n\nCenturyLink Field has hosted two U.S. Open Cup tournament finals. On October 5, 2010, the tournament's 81-year-old attendance record was broken when Sounders FC defeated the Columbus Crew 2–1 in front of 31,311.[191] That record was broken one year later when CenturyLink Field again hosted the final on October 4, 2011, as 36,615 spectators watched Seattle defeat the Chicago Fire 2–0.[192] The stadium has also hosted a CONCACAF Champions League tournament final; on May 4, 2022, the Sounders defeated Pumas UNAM 3–0 in the second leg of the final before a tournament-record crowd of 68,741 to win 5–2 on aggregate, becoming the first MLS team to win the tournament under its current format.[193]\n\n\nLike the Seahawks, the Sounders have received attention for sellout crowds and boisterous fans.[194] *The Seattle Times* reported that a \"new standard for attendance and game-day atmosphere has been set\"[195] due to the loud sellout crowds. The passionate Emerald City Supporters have dubbed the general admission sections behind the south goal the \"Brougham End\" for the street that runs along the south edge of the complex.[196]\n\n\n\n### OL Reign[edit]\n\n\nSee also: OL Reign § Stadium\n\nOL Reign played against Portland Thorns FC at the stadium on August 29, 2021, as part of a doubleheader with the Sounders and Timbers. The Reign defeated the Thorns 2–1 in front of 27,248, breaking the then NWSL's attendance record.[197] The Reign later announced on December 15 that they would move into the stadium for the 2022 season, leaving their previous home, Cheney Stadium in Tacoma, as plans to build a soccer-specific stadium in the city stalled amid the COVID-19 pandemic.[198] The stadium's capacity is reduced to 10,000 seats for most OL Reign home matches.[199] A new NWSL attendance record of 34,130 was set on October 6, 2023, by the Reign for Megan Rapinoe's final home match.[200]\n\n\n\n## Other events[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium became a yearly site for Supercross races in 2005. Seattle had been left out of the circuit since the Kingdome hosted the race in 1999.[201] It takes more than 650 truckloads of dirt to build the course for the event that around 50,000 spectators attend.[202] The stadium has also been used for public speaking engagements. For example, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, Tenzin Gyatso, delivered a 28-minute speech to 50,817 people on April 12, 2008.[203]\n\n\nThe largest concert attendance in the stadium's history was set on July 22, 2023, by Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour; 72,171 spectators watched at Lumen Field on the first of two days.[204] The record was surpassed a month later by Ed Sheeran's The Mathematics Tour, which drew 77,286 to Lumen Field on August 26.[205]\n\n\nLumen Field hosted several events related to the 2023 MLB All-Star Game, which was played at the adjacent T-Mobile Park. The first two rounds of the Major League Baseball draft took place at Lumen Field on July 9.[206] The playing surface was divided into several pitching areas while the north lot and event center include performance stages, batting cages, and museum exhibits.[207]\n\n\n\n### Event Center[edit]\n\n\n\"WaMu Theater\" redirects here. For the theater in New York City at Madison Square Garden formerly sponsored by Washington Mutual, see Hulu Theater.\n\n![](image)Main exhibition hall at the Event Center during a Moderna COVID-19 vaccination session in April 2021\nThe Lumen Field Event Center connects to the stadium's west field plaza and consists of two exhibition halls, a conference room, and a concourse.[21] The center hosts pre-game events for the Seahawks and Mariners. According to the Public Stadium Authority's website, the event center contributes more than half a billion dollars to the region's economy.[208] Originally debuting as the Washington State Stadium Exhibition Center, the center became known as the Seahawks Exhibition Center upon the stadium's opening in 2002.[27][209] The center was renamed the Qwest Field Event Center in 2004 after Qwest acquired naming rights to the complex;[210] it retained the \"Event Center\" name in subsequent renamings of the complex.[211][5]\n\n\nThe Event Center had previously been called \"the worst venue in town\" for concerts, but in 2006, AEG Live and First & Goal formed a partnership to create a new theater within the Event Center space. Washington Mutual (WaMu) obtained the naming rights to the new theater in a 10-year deal, calling it the **WaMu Theater**.[212] The theater space can be assembled on an as-needed basis within the building and equipment, including the 104-foot (32 m) wide stage, can be dismantled and stored in the stadium. The theater's acoustics were improved by installing panels on the ceiling and a large curtain. Depending on the seating configuration, the capacity can be 3,300, 4,000, or 7,000. Seal performed the inaugural concert on November 6, 2006.[213] Though the naming rights deal was terminated following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the theater retained the WaMu name, with AEG intending to seek a new sponsor for it; the meaning of the WaMu abbreviation was subsequently altered to represent \"Washington Music\" instead.[214][215]\n\n\nDuring the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Event Center was contracted for use as a field hospital. The temporary hospital was erected in April 2020 with 250 beds under the management of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Army Corps of Engineers.[216] On April 8, the state government announced that the field hospital would be dismantled and relocated to another state by the federal government, as the pandemic's spread in Washington had slowed.[217] In March 2021, the Event Center was converted into a mass vaccination center with capacity for 4,000 to 5,000 doses per week administered by the city government in partnership with First & Goal and Swedish Health Services.[218] The Event Center was also used as a vote center during the 2020 and 2022 elections by King County.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Seismic experiments[edit]\n\n\nDuring a Seahawks football game on January 8, 2011, the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN) recorded what was dubbed a \"Beast Quake\", for Marshawn \"Beast Mode\" Lynch, a player whose performance on one running play excited the Qwest Field stadium crowd enough for the resultant shaking to be recorded on PNSN instruments.[221][222] In 2014 and 2015 additional sensors were added in and around the stadium. Motivations for the experiment included conducting a quick-reaction exercise for the seismometer network team to install sensors and interpret results, and to test the ability to handle increased web traffic from interested visitors from the general public.[223][224][225][226] Shaking was detected at the stadium after a 90-yard touchdown run during a January 10, 2015 playoff game, dubbed a \"Kam Quake\" for the player making the run, Kam Chancellor.[227][228] The PNSN scientists stated that the biggest event of all was the \"Dance Quake\", which was caused by all the jumping and dancing that followed Marshawn Lynch's touchdown and 2-point conversion during 2014–15 NFC Championship Game on January 18, 2015.[229][230]\n\n\nPNSN has also recorded seismic activity from Sounders fans; multiple earthquakes were recorded on November 10, 2019, during the MLS Cup final between the Sounders and Toronto FC.[231] Further \"RaveQuakes\" were recorded on May 4, 2022, during the second leg of the CONCACAF Champions League Final between the Sounders and Pumas UNAM.[232] During two Taylor Swift concerts for The Eras Tour in July 2023, PSNS recorded a maximum ground acceleration of 0.011 meters per second (2.2 ft/min) with peaks similar to a magnitude 2.3 earthquake. The readings were attributed to fan noise and dancing as well as the sound system used for the concerts.[233]\n\n\n\n## Facility contracts and naming rights[edit]\n\n\n![Aerial view of an empty stadium with prominent arches. The surrounding area has railroad tracks, a plaza, and a parking garage.](image)Aerial view of Lumen Field (then CenturyLink Field) in 2011, showing its blue painted roof\nThe stadium was originally named Seahawks Stadium. The name was changed to Qwest Field in June 2004 after telecommunications carrier Qwest bought the naming rights for $75 million for a period of 15 years.[234] According to the agreement, the proceeds must be used for maintenance and upgrades. A portion of any profit then goes into a $10 million fund Allen guaranteed for youth playfields.[235] As a result of CenturyLink's acquisition of Qwest, the stadium was officially renamed CenturyLink Field on June 23, 2011.[4][236] CenturyLink renewed its naming rights contract in 2017, paying $162.7 million for the stadium from 2019 to 2033.[237] Although CenturyLink changed its corporate name to Lumen Technologies in September 2020, the stadium was to retain the CenturyLink Field name due to a clause in the contract that permits a one-time name change only if a corporate takeover occurs.[238][239] Despite that clause, the name was changed to Lumen Field on November 19 following approval from the Washington State Public Stadium Authority.[5]\n\n\nAfter the stadium was renamed for CenturyLink in 2011, fans and media outlets speculated on potential nicknames for the venue. An informal reader poll conducted by *The Seattle Times* showed that \"The Clink\" was a popular suggestion;[240] it was subsequently used among fans and locals.[241][242] From 2009 to 2018, the field was entitled \"The Xbox Pitch at CenturyLink Field\" during Sounders FC matches as part of a sponsorship deal with Microsoft.[239][243] However, when Zulily took over the Sounders FC sponsorship before the start of the 2019 season, the field was left unnamed; the deal did not include naming rights to the field.[244] A new sponsorship with the Puyallup Tribe of Indians was announced in September 2022, renaming the field to \"Emerald Queen Casino Pitch at Lumen Field\".[245]\n\n\nIn addition to its 48 concession stands, restaurants and lounges are located throughout the stadium.[35][246] Along with typical fare, local Pacific salmon sandwiches, Dungeness crab cakes, and microbrews are served,[246][247] as well as food from Chinatown–International District restaurants.[47] Aramark was the initial food and beverage service provider for the stadium and exhibition center, having signed a five-year contract in 2001.[248] Levy Restaurants followed with a five-year deal to provide the service for the complex in 2006, while Delaware North Sportservice took over service operations in 2013;[249][250] under both contracts, First & Goal paid a management fee to the vendor while covering operational costs.[251] The Seahawks subsequently created First & Goal Hospitality to provide the food and beverage service in-house in 2017, doing so until Levy regained the rights via a partnership in 2020; the service continued to operate under the former brand as part of the agreement.[251][252]\n\n\nThe pouring rights of non-alcoholic beverages at the stadium were initially held by The Coca-Cola Company, which had a longstanding partnership with the Seahawks prior to 1998, when the team partnered with PepsiCo. In May 2007, Seattle-based Jones Soda outbid Coca-Cola to sign a five-year contract for the rights, making it the only venue in the NFL that did not have a contract with either Coca-Cola or PepsiCo.[253] Jones Soda, known for unusual and holiday-themed soda flavors such as Blue Bubblegum and Turkey & Gravy, said it was working to develop football-related soda flavors, such as \"grass-stain\".[254] Amid increasing financial turmoil for Jones Soda, the company renegotiated its contract with the Seahawks in September 2009, relinquishing the rights to provide energy drinks and water along with a luxury suite.[255] Both parties ultimately announced their mutual decision to end the Jones sponsorship in June 2010,[256] following which Coca-Cola reclaimed the vending rights with a five-year agreement.[257] The Seahawks and Coca-Cola announced a multi-year partnership extension in 2018.[258]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![The last commuter train at a train station with a brightly lit stadium nearby. The stadium's roof supports are colored with green and red lights for the Christmas season.](image)A Sounder commuter train and Amtrak's Coast Starlight at nearby King Street Station after a Seahawks game in 2008\nLumen Field is bordered by the Pioneer Square, International District, and Industrial District neighborhoods of Seattle. The stadium's referendum approval required a transportation management program to coordinate transportation options. First & Goal's facility lease agreement also included a provision to ease gridlock.[18] A \"Dual Event Agreement\" with T-Mobile Park was established so that two events with a combined attendance of over 58,000 would not occur within four hours of each other.[259] The agreement was also implemented to coordinate mass transit to the stadiums on game days. Local and regional buses service the area with stops within three blocks of the stadium, and the county's Metro Transit bus service formerly offered express routes from several area park and ride lots for games.[260] Trains service the stadium through Seattle's King Street Station and overflow tracks accommodate extra trains during events.[261] Regional commuter trains operate on Sundays if the Seahawks have a home game. Trains also run for mid-day Sounders FC games on Saturdays.[262] In 2008, the commuter trains carried 64,000 event goers to the two nearby stadiums.[261] Amtrak, primarily through the Pacific Northwest corridor's Cascades route, also serves the station. On July 18, 2009, Link light rail service between SeaTac and downtown began in time for an exhibition match between the Sounders and Chelsea.[261] The light rail system's 1 Line connects to the baseball and football stadiums via the Stadium station. The International District/Chinatown station also offers convenient access to the north entrance.[263][264]\n\n\nLumen Field is located near the junction of Interstate 5 and Interstate 90 to the east. It is bordered by State Route 99 and the south portal of the State Route 99 tunnel to its west, while the State Route 519 corridor connects I-90 to the neighborhood. Local governments compromised with both the Seahawks and Mariners on the location of new ramps over the train tracks that run along the east sides of Lumen Field and T-Mobile Park. An overpass for South Royal Brougham Way, the road that borders the south edge of the Lumen Field complex, to improve access and safety was completed in May 2010.[265] The stadium has 2,000 parking spaces in its parking garage and 8,400 in the surrounding lots to accommodate automobile traffic. Beginning in December 2011, construction of the Stadium Place mixed-use development project replaced much of the north lot. The developer must replace the 500 lost parking spots and turn over parking revenue to the Public Stadium Authority per an agreement with King County.[266]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\nNotes\n1. **^** View from the southernmost point of the eastern grandstand's upper deck, looking northwards.

Its primary tenant is the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL). It opened in 2001 to replace the Broncos' original home, the old Mile High Stadium. The venue was previously home of the Denver Outlaws lacrosse team and the Colorado Rapids soccer team. It has also played host to countless concerts and served as the venue for Barack Obama's acceptance of the Democratic presidential nomination at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\n\n\nThe stadium is nicknamed *Mile High* due to not only its predecessor, but due to the city's elevation of 1 mile or 5,280 feet (1,610 m) above sea level.[6] Given the difficulty of competing at altitude, as well as the notoriously loud fans, the Broncos are known to have one of the best home field advantages in the NFL.[7]\n\n\nOn March 24, 2022, a fire broke out that damaged some suites and many seats on the third level. The fire was caused by sparks from a welding torch.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Financing[edit]\n\n\n### Legislative effort[edit]\n\n\nThe Broncos' pursuit of the new stadium included a lobbying effort that included 13 lawyers and tens of thousands of dollars. This effort was directed at the passing of SB 171 which put Referendum 4A on the November 1998 ballot. SB 171 was sponsored by Representative Doug Dean (R) from Colorado Springs. Members of the state legislature claimed that this was one of the largest lobbying efforts they had seen.[9]\n\n\nIn November 1998, Denver voters passed referendum 4A which was in favor of the construction of a new football stadium to replace the existing Mile High Stadium. The referendum was included on the ballots of six Colorado counties that comprise the Denver Metropolitan area.[10] The referendum called for the extension of a tenth of a percent sales tax on transactions within the Metro area to go towards the cost of issuing a $224.9 million bond.[11] This tax was originally established in 1990 when the Colorado Rockies sought public financing for Coors Field.[12] Financing and construction for the stadium was monitored by the Metropolitan Football Stadium District (MFSD). The MFSD is a subdivision of the State of Colorado that, \"was created for the purpose of planning, acquiring land and constructing a professional football stadium\". The MFSD is also responsible for implementing the MFSD tax.[13] The extension of the original stadium tax came into effect on January 1, 2001.[12]\n\n\nThe funding deal between the Broncos and the State of Colorado called for the team to pay 25% of the estimated cost of $400 million while the state would pay the other 75% of the cost. Part of the agreement stipulated that the MFSD would collect half of the 10 year, $120 million naming rights deal with Invesco Funds Group. Upon Sports Authority’s bankruptcy, the Broncos agreed to pay the MFSD $3.6 million to assume ownership of the naming rights of the stadium.[11]\n\n\n\n## Corporate partners[edit]\n\n\n### Naming rights[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion** with: missing information about Invescos bankruptcy yet the stadium remained named \"Invesco Field\" for many years after the bankruptcy. You can help by adding to it. *(May 2022)*\n |\n\n\nInvesco paid $120 million for the original naming rights in 2001, before Sports Authority secured them in August 2011.[14]\n\n\nDespite its sponsor's liquidation and closure in 2016, the Sports Authority name remained on the stadium for two years afterwards because of regulatory hurdles. The Broncos announced on January 2, 2018 that the stadium's exterior signage would be removed.[15] The stadium took on a temporary name, Broncos Stadium at Mile High, for the remainder of 2018 - including the 2018 NFL season - and part of 2019 before a new corporate naming rights agreement with Colorado-based Empower was announced on September 4, 2019.[16]\n\n\n\n### Concessions[edit]\n\n\nConcessions are currently run by Aramark Corporation. Aramark took over concession at the beginning of the 2019 season as Empower Retirement assumed the naming rights. As part of their offerings, Aramark has partnered with several Denver restaurants to provide a more robust selection of food options. The new partners include Frank Bonanno, a Denver restaurateur known for his many popular restaurants around downtown Denver.[17]\n\n\n\n## Improvements[edit]\n\n\nOn December 21, 2012, the Broncos announced a $30 million renovation project prior to the start of the 2013 season, including a new HD LED video board on the stadium's south end zone that tripled the size of the video board used in the early 2000s.[18]\n\n\nIn 2013, it was revealed that a Neil Smith Kansas City Chiefs jersey was buried somewhere near the 50-yard line by a couple of out-of-state contractors during renovations, despite Smith's play on the Broncos' Super Bowl XXXII and XXXIII-winning teams. The curse the contractors hoped to create did not occur as the Broncos won another Super Bowl two years later, Super Bowl 50.[19]\n\n\nIn an effort to be selected as a host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the MFSD invested $8.3 million on stadium improvements to satisfy FIFA's requirements. Included in the improvements are the addition of LED lights as well as locker room and seating upgrades.[20]\n\n\nOn December 14, 2022 the Broncos announced more than $100 million in upgrades to the stadium that would be completed during the off season and in time for the 2023 season. Upgrades include expanding the video board and an all-inclusive hospitality club on field level.[21] In August 2023, the Broncos debuted the improvements, including the new scoreboard, measuring 225 feet (69 m) wide by 72 feet (22 m) tall, making it the fifth largest screen in any NFL stadium.[22]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Naming rights[edit]\n\n\nDuring construction of the new stadium, Denver mayor, Wellington Webb opposed the sale of the stadium's naming rights. At this time, the potential partners were AT&T, Janus Capital, and Invesco Funds Group. A group called Friends of Mile High created a poll asking whether fans preferred the old name or would be fine with a corporate sponsor. The poll found that 70% of respondents preferred to keep the name as Mile High despite a potential loss of $89 million in revenue for the state.[23]\n\n\nMany fans opposed a corporate name and wished to retain the previous venue's name, \"Mile High Stadium.\"[24] *The Denver Post* initially refused to use the Invesco label and referred to it as Mile High Stadium for several years before changing its policy and adding Invesco to articles.\n\n\nOn August 16, 2011, the Metropolitan Stadium District announced Invesco would immediately transfer the naming rights to Englewood-based Sports Authority in a 25-year agreement worth $6 million per year.[14] In August 2016, the Denver Broncos paid $3,601,890 to the Metropolitan Football Stadium District to purchase the naming rights to the stadium.[25] As the naming rights change began to occur, the MFSD sought permission to install larger signs on the newly named stadium. Residents of the neighborhood sought to block the installation of new signs in an effort to keep light pollution down. Neighborhood complaints included concerns about light pollution as well as the aesthetic value of the Sports Authority sign that the MFSD hoped to install on the stadium.[26]\n\n\nIn 2016, several Colorado legislators attempted to pass a bill in the Colorado State Legislature that would require the \"Mile High\" moniker regardless of any naming rights deal, citing the large public contribution to the stadium's construction;[27] the bill failed to pass out of a Senate Committee in May 2016.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)A comparison of the actual loss and the budgeted loss for the Metropolitan Football Stadium District for the years 2014 to 2018.\nMany citizens of the surrounding neighborhoods have expressed discontent with the impact of the stadium on their environment. Residents have complained about the increased traffic on game days, frequent public urination by intoxicated fans.[12]\n\n\n\n### Financing[edit]\n\n\nA 2016 study by the Brookings Institution has found that the federal government lost out on significant tax revenue in their deal with the Broncos to pay for the stadium. The study of 36 professional football stadiums found that the tax exempt municipal bonds caused $49 million in lost tax revenue for the federal government. Additionally, the income tax break that bond holders could claim cost the government an additional $5 million.[29]\n\n\n\n## Usage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Playing surface for a Denver Broncos game\nThe stadium is used primarily for American football games. It is the home field for Denver's National Football League team, the Denver Broncos. The stadium previously hosted one of the city's Major League Lacrosse teams, the Denver Outlaws. In college football, it has hosted the rivalry game between the Colorado State University Rams and the University of Colorado Boulder Buffaloes. It is also used for the CHSAA class 4A and 5A Colorado high school football state championship games, and has been used for the CBA Marching Band Finals.\n\n\nIn addition, it has been used for a Drum Corps International (DCI) Championship in 2004 and the annual Drums Along the Rockies competition. It is also used for concerts, music festivals and other events, and was home to the city's Major League Soccer franchise, the Colorado Rapids, before that team built and moved into Dick's Sporting Goods Park in suburban Commerce City.\n\n\nOn June 23, 2018, England played New Zealand in a rugby league match at the stadium.[30] England won the match 36-18.\n\n\n\n## Location[edit]\n\n\nThe construction of the stadium marked the completion of a six-year sporting venue upgrade program in Denver, including the construction of Coors Field and of Pepsi Center. As with the other venues, the stadium was constructed to be easily accessible. It sits along Interstate 25 near the Colfax Avenue and 17th Avenue exits. It is also bordered by Federal Boulevard, a major Denver thoroughfare, on the west side. A dedicated light rail station also serves the stadium. The stadium is located in the Sun Valley neighborhood.\n\n\n\n## Stadium culture and traditions[edit]\n\n\nA home game tradition (carried over from the original Mile High Stadium) is the \"Incomplete Chant.\" At Broncos home games, when the opposing team throws an incomplete pass, the stadium announcer will state \"Pass thrown by [the opposing quarterback] intended for [the opposing intended receiver] is...\" at which time the fans complete the sentence by shouting \"IN-COM-PLETE!!\".[31] The Broncos filed to register a trademark for the chant in 2020.[32] In a tradition carried over from Mile High Stadium, the stadium's public-address announcer will give the final official attendance for the game, including the number of unused tickets; in response, Broncos fans \"boo\" the no-shows. During the stadium's first years, in another tradition that was carried over from Mile High, Broncos fans on one side of the stadium would chant \"Go\" and fans on the other side would respond \"Broncos,\" back and forth chanting for several minutes. That tradition has since died out. Another long-term tradition is famed rowdiness of fans seated in the \"South Stands,\" although this tradition has diminished significantly as well. Finally, especially in the upper two decks, the fans create their own 'Mile High Thunder' (and warm themselves) by stamping their feet on the stadium's floors. The old Mile High Stadium was built with bare metal, and the 'Thunder' reverberated readily. The new stadium was built with steel floors to preserve this unique acoustic feature.[33]\n\n\nThe stadium also continued the tradition of displaying Bucky the Bronco, a 30-foot (9.1 m) high replica of Roy Rogers horse, Trigger, on top of the main scoreboard.[34]\n\n\nThe stadium has sold out every Denver Broncos' home game since its inception in 2001, extending the \"sold-out\" streak that began during the team's tenure at Mile High Stadium, where every home game had been sold out since 1970 (though due to NFL policy, local TV broadcasts of sold-out games did not start until 1973).\n\n\n\n## Notable events[edit]\n\n\n### NFL events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Interior view during the 2013 AFC Championship game\nOn September 10, 2001, the stadium hosted its first regular season NFL game, in which the Broncos defeated the New York Giants 31–20. In a pre-game ceremony, Broncos legends John Elway, Steve Atwater, Randy Gradishar, Haven Moses, Billy Thompson, Floyd Little, Dennis Smith, and Karl Mecklenburg helped to \"Move the Thunder\" from the old Mile High Stadium to the new home of the Broncos.[*citation needed*] As this inaugural game happened to fall on the day before 9/11, it has been referenced by survivor Pasquale Buzzelli in an interview with Joe Budden.\n\n\nThe stadium has hosted several NFL playoff games. It hosted the 2005 AFC Divisional playoff game, in which Denver defeated the New England Patriots 27–13. The following week, it hosted the AFC Championship Game, which the Broncos lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 34–17. On January 8, 2012, the stadium hosted its third NFL playoff game, an AFC Wild Card playoff game against the Steelers. The Broncos won in overtime, 29–23. On January 12, 2013, the stadium hosted its fourth NFL playoff game, an AFC Divisional playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens. The Broncos lost to the Ravens 38–35 in double overtime.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2007, a record crowd of 77,160 watched the Broncos lose to the Green Bay Packers 19–13 on Monday Night Football on the first play from scrimmage in overtime.[35]\n\n\nOn November 26, 2009, it hosted its first Thanksgiving game, when the Broncos took on the Giants. The game was televised on NFL Network, which the Broncos won by a final score of 26–6.[36]\n\n\nOn January 19, 2014, the Broncos defeated the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, 26–16 in front of 77,110 fans in attendance, advancing to their first Super Bowl since they began play in the new stadium.\n\n\nOn January 17, 2016, the Broncos defeated the Steelers in the AFC Divisional playoffs, 23–16 in front of 77,100, advancing to the AFC Championship Game for the 10th time in franchise history.\n\n\nOn January 24, 2016, the Broncos defeated the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, 20–18 in front of 77,100, advancing to Super Bowl 50, which they won two weeks later.\n\n\n\n### Soccer[edit]\n\n\nOn July 26, 2014, Sports Authority Field at Mile High hosted a soccer match between Manchester United and A.S. Roma which was part of the 2014 International Champions Cup and Manchester United won the match 3-2.[37]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Winning Team\n | Result\n | Losing Team\n | Tournament\n | Spectators\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| April 3, 2002 | **![](image) United States** | 1–0 | ![](image) Mexico | International Friendly | 48,476\n |\n| June 1, 2011 | **![](image) Mexico** | 3–0 | ![](image) New Zealand | 45,401\n |\n| July 14, 2013 | ![](image) Panama | 0–0 | ![](image) Canada | 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup | 30,000\n |\n| **![](image) Mexico** | 3–1 | ![](image) Martinique |\n| July 26, 2014 | **![England](image) Manchester United** | 3–2 | ![Italy](image) A.S.

The first football game held (college, on September 1, 2001; attendance 75,022) was the Rocky Mountain Showdown, when the University of Colorado Buffaloes defeated the Colorado State University Rams 41–14. On July 2, 2005, it hosted the 2005 Major League Lacrosse All-Star Game. In 2006, Major League Lacrosse placed the expansion Outlaws in Denver.\n\n\nIn August 1977, 1978 and 2004, it hosted the Drum Corps International (DCI) World Championships, and every July hosts Drums Along the Rockies, which is a major competition in the annual DCI summer tour.[52][53] Drums Along the Rockies is the longest-running event held at any Mile High named stadium, from 1963 through 2019. Although canceled in 2020 due to the COVID Pandemic, the event is expected to return in July 2021.\n\n\nOn August 28, 2008, Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States here, moving the 2008 Democratic National Convention from Ball Arena. Approximately 84,000 people attended Obama's speech, exceeding the normal capacity of the stadium due to the placement of audience on the field.[54][55][56]\n\n\nOn April 13, 2019, the stadium hosted its first AMA Supercross Championship event.\n\n\nOn April 27, 2019, the stadium hosted its first Monster Jam show. On April 23, 2022, it hosted another.\n\n\nThe stadium was a candidate venue for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, however it was not chosen by FIFA as one of the 16 venues to host to the tournament.[57]\n\n\n\n## Denver Broncos Ring of Fame[edit]\n\n\nThe Denver Broncos Ring of Fame was created in 1984 by team owner Pat Bowlen to honor former players and administrators who played significant roles in the franchise's history. The names and years of service (and in most cases, jersey numbers) of the men inducted into the ring are displayed on the Level 5 facade of the stadium. There is no specific number of new members that may be chosen for induction in any given year; in many years, no new members were inducted.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Inducted or Enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame[58] |\n\n\n\n\n| Denver Broncos Ring of Fame\n |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Name\n | Position(s)\n | Seasons\n | Inducted\n |\n| **23** | Goose Gonsoulin | S | 1960–66 | 1984\n |\n| **87** | Rich Jackson | DE | 1967–72 | 1984\n |\n| **44** | Floyd Little | RB | 1967–75 | 1984\n |\n| **87** | Lionel Taylor | WR | 1960–66 | 1984\n |\n| – | Gerald Phipps | Owner | 1961–81 | 1985\n |\n| **12** | Charley Johnson | QB | 1972–75 | 1986\n |\n| **70** | Paul Smith | DE | 1968–78 | 1986\n |\n| **18** | Frank Tripucka | QB | 1960–63 | 1986\n |\n| **36** | Billy Thompson | S | 1969–81 | 1987\n |\n| **7** | Craig Morton | QB | 1977–82 | 1988\n |\n| **25** | Haven Moses | WR | 1972–81 | 1988\n |\n| **15** | Jim Turner | PK | 1971–79 | 1988\n |\n| **53** | Randy Gradishar | LB | 1974–83 | 1989\n |\n| **57** | Tom Jackson | LB | 1973–86 | 1992\n |\n| **20** | Louis Wright | CB | 1975–86 | 1993\n |\n| **7** | John Elway | QBGeneral manager | 1983–982011–2020 | 1999\n |\n| **77** | Karl Mecklenburg | LB | 1983–95 | 2001\n |\n| **49** | Dennis Smith | S | 1981–94 | 2001\n |\n| **65** | Gary Zimmerman | OT | 1993–97 | 2003\n |\n| **27** | Steve Atwater | S | 1989–98 | 2005\n |\n| **30** | Terrell Davis | RB | 1995–2001 | 2007\n |\n| **84** | Shannon Sharpe | TE | 1990–99, 2002–03 | 2009\n |\n| **80** | Rod Smith | WR | 1994–2006 | 2012\n |\n| **66** | Tom Nalen | C | 1994–2007 | 2013\n |\n| **21** | Gene Mingo | RB, K, RS | 1960–64 | 2014\n |\n| – | Dan Reeves | Head coach | 1981–92 | 2014\n |\n| **80** | Rick Upchurch | WR, RS | 1975–83 | 2014\n |\n| – | Pat Bowlen | Owner | 1984–2019 | 2015\n |\n| **1** | Jason Elam | PK | 1993–2007 | 2016\n |\n| **73** | Simon Fletcher | LB/DE | 1985–95 | 2016\n |\n| **47** | John Lynch | S | 2004–07 | 2016\n |\n| — | Red Miller | Head coach | 1977–80 | 2017\n |\n| **24** | Champ Bailey | CB | 2004–2013 | 2019\n |\n| **18** | Peyton Manning | QB | 2012-2015 | 2021\n |\n\n\nWhile the Ring of Fame was carried over from the old stadium to the new, the names were re-ordered to separate the inductees who served the team during the pre-Pat Bowlen (the team's current owner and founder of the Ring) era from those who served during Bowlen's ownership. One of the most noticeable changes was the move of John Elway's name to the center of the ring, located directly between the goalposts of the north end zone.[59]\n\n\n\n## Colorado Sports Hall of Fame Museum[edit]\n\n\nThe Colorado Sports Hall of Fame Museum opened in August 2001. It is located at Gate #1 on the west side of the stadium.\n\n\n\n## 2022 fire[edit]\n\n\nA fire broke out on March 24, 2022, destroying several sections of third row seats and fourth-level suites, though no injuries were reported. The fire caused damage to approximately \"1000 feet of seating.\" The cause of the fire was determined to be from a welding torch being used on an expansion joint.[8] The fire also forced Empower Field at Mile High staff to reorganize events scheduled to take place at the stadium.[60] The damage was said to be a \"real challenge\" to repair in time for the next Denver Broncos regular season, due to damage to steel risers and difficulties in procuring replacement materials.[61]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Mile High Stadium\n* Coors Field\n* Ball Arena\n* Dick's Sporting Goods Park\n* McNichols Arena\n* National Sports Center for the Disabled\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Broncos Ditching Synthetic Field At Mile High, Using Kentucky Bluegrass Grown In Colorado\".
