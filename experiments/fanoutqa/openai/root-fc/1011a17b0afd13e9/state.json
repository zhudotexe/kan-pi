The surface gravity may be thought of as the acceleration due to gravity experienced by a hypothetical test particle which is very close to the object's surface and which, in order not to disturb the system, has negligible mass. For objects where the surface is deep in the atmosphere and the radius not known, the surface gravity is given at the 1 bar pressure level in the atmosphere.\n\n\nSurface gravity is measured in units of acceleration, which, in the SI system, are meters per second squared. It may also be expressed as a multiple of the Earth's standard surface gravity, which is equal to[1]\n\n\n\n*g* = 9.80665\u00a0m/s2\n\nIn astrophysics, the surface gravity may be expressed as log *g*, which is obtained by first expressing the gravity in cgs units, where the unit of acceleration and surface gravity is centimeters per second squared (cm/s2), and then taking the base-10 logarithm of the cgs value of the surface gravity.[2] Therefore, the surface gravity of Earth could be expressed in cgs units as 980.665\u00a0cm/s2, and then taking the base-10 logarithm (\"log\u00a0*g*\") of 980.665, and we get 2.992 as \"log\u00a0*g*\".\n\n\nThe surface gravity of a white dwarf is very high, and of a neutron star even higher. A white dwarf's surface gravity is around 100,000 *g* (106\u00a0m/s2) whilst the neutron star's compactness gives it a surface gravity of up to 7\u00d71012\u00a0m/s2 with typical values of order 1012\u00a0m/s2 (that is more than 1011 times that of Earth). One measure of such immense gravity is that neutron stars have an escape velocity of around 100,000 km/s, about a third of the speed of light. For black holes, the surface gravity must be calculated relativistically.\n\n\n\n\n## Relationship of surface gravity to mass and radius[edit]\n\n\n\n\nSurface gravity of various  \nSolar System bodies[3]  \n(1\u00a0*g*\u00a0=\u00a09.80665\u00a0m/s2, the average surface gravitational acceleration on Earth)\n\n| Name\n | Surface gravity\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Sun | 28.02 *g* |\n| Mercury | 00.377 *g* |\n| Venus | 00.905 *g* |\n| Earth | 01 *g* (midlatitudes)\n |\n| Moon | 00.165\u00a07 *g* (average)\n |\n| Mars | 00.379 *g* (midlatitudes)\n |\n| Phobos | 00.000\u00a0581 *g* |\n| Deimos | 00.000\u00a0306 *g* |\n| Pallas | 00.022 *g* (equator)\n |\n| Vesta | 00.025 *g* (equator)\n |\n| Ceres | 00.029 *g* |\n| Jupiter | 02.528 *g* (midlatitudes)\n |\n| Io | 00.183 *g* |\n| Europa | 00.134 *g* |\n| Ganymede | 00.146 *g* |\n| Callisto | 00.126 *g* |\n| Saturn | 01.065 *g* (midlatitudes)\n |\n| Mimas | 00.006\u00a048 *g* |\n| Enceladus | 00.011\u00a05 *g* |\n| Tethys | 00.014\u00a09 *g* |\n| Dione | 00.023\u00a07 *g* |\n| Rhea | 00.026\u00a09 *g* |\n| Titan | 00.138 *g* |\n| Hyperion | 00.001\u00a07\u20130.002\u00a01 *g*(depending on location)\n |\n| Iapetus | 00.022\u00a08 *g* |\n| Phoebe | 00.003\u00a09\u20130.005\u00a01 *g* |\n| Uranus | 00.886 *g* (equator)\n |\n| Miranda | 00.007\u00a09 *g* |\n| Ariel | 00.025\u00a04 *g* |\n| Umbriel | 00.023 *g* |\n| Titania | 00.037\u00a02 *g* |\n| Oberon | 00.036\u00a01 *g* |\n| Neptune | 01.137 *g* (midlatitudes)\n |\n| Proteus | 00.007 *g* |\n| Triton | 00.079\u00a04 *g* |\n| Pluto | 00.063 *g* |\n| Charon | 00.029\u00a04 *g* |\n| Eris | 00.084 *g* |\n| Haumea | 00.0247 *g* (equator)\n |\n| 67P-CG | 00.000\u00a0017 *g* |\n\n\nIn the Newtonian theory of gravity, the gravitational force exerted by an object is proportional to its mass: an object with twice the mass produces twice as much force. Newtonian gravity also follows an inverse square law, so that moving an object twice as far away divides its gravitational force by four, and moving it ten times as far away divides it by 100. This is similar to the intensity of light, which also follows an inverse square law: with relation to distance, light becomes less visible. Generally speaking, this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to point-source radiation into three-dimensional space.\n\n\nA large object, such as a planet or star, will usually be approximately round, approaching hydrostatic equilibrium (where all points on the surface have the same amount of gravitational potential energy). On a small scale, higher parts of the terrain are eroded, with eroded material deposited in lower parts of the terrain. On a large scale, the planet or star itself deforms until equilibrium is reached.[4] For most celestial objects, the result is that the planet or star in question can be treated as a near-perfect sphere when the rotation rate is low. However, for young, massive stars, the equatorial azimuthal velocity can be quite high\u2014up to 200\u00a0km/s or more\u2014causing a significant amount of equatorial bulge. Examples of such rapidly rotating stars include Achernar, Altair, Regulus A and Vega.\n\n\nThe fact that many large celestial objects are approximately spheres makes it easier to calculate their surface gravity. According to the shell theorem, the gravitational force outside a spherically symmetric body is the same as if its entire mass were concentrated in the center, as was established by Sir Isaac Newton.[5] Therefore, the surface gravity of a planet or star with a given mass will be approximately inversely proportional to the square of its radius, and the surface gravity of a planet or star with a given average density will be approximately proportional to its radius. For example, the recently discovered planet, Gliese 581 c, has at least 5 times the mass of Earth, but is unlikely to have 5 times its surface gravity. If its mass is no more than 5 times that of the Earth, as is expected,[6] and if it is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth.[7][8] Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.2 times as strong as on Earth. If it is an icy or watery planet, its radius might be as large as twice the Earth's, in which case its surface gravity might be no more than 1.25 times as strong as the Earth's.[8]\n\n\nThese proportionalities may be expressed by the formula:\ng\n\u221d\n\n\nm\n\nr\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g\\propto {\\frac {m}{r^{2}}}}\n![{\\displaystyle g\\propto {\\frac {m}{r^{2}}}}](image)\n\nwhere *g* is the surface gravity of an object, expressed as a multiple of the Earth's, *m* is its mass, expressed as a multiple of the Earth's mass (5.976\u00d71024\u00a0kg) and *r* its radius, expressed as a multiple of the Earth's (mean) radius (6,371\u00a0km).[9] For instance, Mars has a mass of 6.4185\u00d71023\u00a0kg\u00a0=\u00a00.107 Earth masses and a mean radius of 3,390\u00a0km\u00a0=\u00a00.532 Earth radii.[10] The surface gravity of Mars is therefore approximately\n0.107\n\n0.532\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n=\n0.38\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {0.107}{0.532^{2}}}=0.38}\n![{\\displaystyle {\\frac {0.107}{0.532^{2}}}=0.38}](image)\n\ntimes that of Earth. Without using the Earth as a reference body, the surface gravity may also be calculated directly from Newton's law of universal gravitation, which gives the formula\ng\n=\n\n\n\nG\nM\n\n\nr\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g={\\frac {GM}{r^{2}}}}\n![{\\displaystyle g={\\frac {GM}{r^{2}}}}](image)\n\nwhere *M* is the mass of the object, *r* is its radius, and *G* is the gravitational constant. If we let *\u03c1* = *M*/*V* denote the mean density of the object, we can also write this as\ng\n=\n\n\n\n4\n\u03c0\n\n3\n\n\nG\n\u03c1\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g={\\frac {4\\pi }{3}}G\\rho r}\n![{\\displaystyle g={\\frac {4\\pi }{3}}G\\rho r}](image)\n\nso that, for fixed mean density, the surface gravity *g* is proportional to the radius\u00a0*r*.\n\n\nSince gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, a space station 400\u00a0km above the Earth feels almost the same gravitational force as we do on the Earth's surface. A space station does not plummet to the ground because it is in an orbit around the Earth.\n\n\n\n## Gas giants[edit]\n\n\nFor gas giant planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the surface gravity is given at the 1 bar pressure level in the atmosphere.[11]\n\n\n\n## Non-spherically symmetric objects[edit]\n\n\nMost real astronomical objects are not perfectly spherically symmetric. One reason for this is that they are often rotating, which means that they are affected by the combined effects of gravitational force and centrifugal force. This causes stars and planets to be oblate, which means that their surface gravity is smaller at the equator than at the poles. This effect was exploited by Hal Clement in his SF novel *Mission of Gravity*, dealing with a massive, fast-spinning planet where gravity was much higher at the poles than at the equator.\n\n\nTo the extent that an object's internal distribution of mass differs from a symmetric model, we may use the measured surface gravity to deduce things about the object's internal structure. This fact has been put to practical use since 1915\u20131916, when Roland E\u00f6tv\u00f6s's torsion balance was used to prospect for oil near the city of Egbell (now Gbely, Slovakia.)[12]:\u200a1663[13]:\u200a223 In 1924, the torsion balance was used to locate the Nash Dome oil fields in Texas.[13]:\u200a223\n\n\nIt is sometimes useful to calculate the surface gravity of simple hypothetical objects which are not found in nature. The surface gravity of infinite planes, tubes, lines, hollow shells, cones, and even more unrealistic structures may be used to provide insights into the behavior of real structures.\n\n\n\n## Black holes[edit]\n\n\nIn relativity, the Newtonian concept of acceleration turns out not to be clear cut. For a black hole, which must be treated relativistically, one cannot define a surface gravity as the acceleration experienced by a test body at the object's surface because there is no surface. This is because the acceleration of a test body at the event horizon of a black hole turns out to be infinite in relativity. Because of this, a renormalized value is used that corresponds to the Newtonian value in the non-relativistic limit. The value used is generally the local proper acceleration (which diverges at the event horizon) multiplied by the gravitational time dilation factor (which goes to zero at the event horizon). For the Schwarzschild case, this value is mathematically well behaved for all non-zero values of *r* and\u00a0*M*.\n\n\nWhen one talks about the surface gravity of a black hole, one is defining a notion that behaves analogously to the Newtonian surface gravity, but is not the same thing. In fact, the surface gravity of a general black hole is not well defined. However, one can define the surface gravity for a black hole whose event horizon is a Killing horizon.\n\n\nThe surface gravity \n\n\n\n\u03ba\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n\n![{\\displaystyle \\kappa }](image) of a static Killing horizon is the acceleration, as exerted at infinity, needed to keep an object at the horizon. Mathematically, if \n\n\n\n\nk\n\na\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k^{a}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle k^{a}}](image) is a suitably normalized Killing vector, then the surface gravity is defined by\nk\n\na\n\n\n\n\n\u2207\n\na\n\n\n\nk\n\nb\n\n\n=\n\u03ba\n\nk\n\nb\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k^{a}\\,\\nabla \\_{a}k^{b}=\\kappa k^{b},}\n![{\\displaystyle k^{a}\\,\\nabla _{a}k^{b}=\\kappa k^{b},}](image)\n\nwhere the equation is evaluated at the horizon.

This is because all stationary black holes have a horizon that is Killing.[16] Recently there has been a shift towards defining the surface gravity of dynamical black holes whose spacetime does not admit a Killing vector (field).[17] Several definitions have been proposed over the years by various authors. As of current, there is no consensus or agreement of which definition, if any, is correct.[18]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Taylor, Barry N., ed.

Red shows the areas where gravity is stronger than the smooth, standard value, and blue reveals areas where gravity is weaker (**Animated version**).[1]\nThe **gravity of Earth**, denoted by **g**, is the net acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the combined effect of gravitation (from mass distribution within Earth) and the centrifugal force (from the Earth's rotation).[2][3]\nIt is a vector quantity, whose direction coincides with a plumb bob and strength or magnitude is given by the norm \n\n\n\ng\n=\n\u2016\n\n\n\ng\n\n\n\n\u2016\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g=\\|{\\mathit {\\mathbf {g} }}\\|}\n\n![{\\displaystyle g=\\|{\\mathit {\\mathbf {g} }}\\|}](image).\n\n\nIn SI units this acceleration is expressed in metres per second squared (in symbols, m/s2 or m\u00b7s\u22122) or equivalently in newtons per kilogram (N/kg or N\u00b7kg\u22121). Near Earth's surface, the acceleration due to gravity, accurate to 2 significant figures, is 9.8\u00a0m/s2 (32\u00a0ft/s2). This means that, ignoring the effects of air resistance, the speed of an object falling freely will increase by about 9.8 metres (32\u00a0ft) per second every second. This quantity is sometimes referred to informally as *little g* (in contrast, the gravitational constant G is referred to as *big G*).\n\n\nThe precise strength of Earth's gravity varies with location. The agreed upon value for standard gravity is 9.80665\u00a0m/s2 (32.1740\u00a0ft/s2) by definition.[4] This quantity is denoted variously as *g*n, *g*e (though this sometimes means the normal gravity at the equator, 9.7803267715\u00a0m/s2 (32.087686258\u00a0ft/s2)),[5] *g*0, or simply g (which is also used for the variable local value).\n\n\nThe weight of an object on Earth's surface is the downwards force on that object, given by Newton's second law of motion, or *F* = *m* *a* (*force* = *mass* \u00d7 *acceleration*). Gravitational acceleration contributes to the total gravity acceleration, but other factors, such as the rotation of Earth, also contribute, and, therefore, affect the weight of the object. Gravity does not normally include the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun, which are accounted for in terms of tidal effects.\n\n\n\n\n## Variation in magnitude[edit]\n\n\nA non-rotating perfect sphere of uniform mass density, or whose density varies solely with distance from the centre (spherical symmetry), would produce a gravitational field of uniform magnitude at all points on its surface. The Earth is rotating and is also not spherically symmetric; rather, it is slightly flatter at the poles while bulging at the Equator: an oblate spheroid. There are consequently slight deviations in the magnitude of gravity across its surface.\n\n\nGravity on the Earth's surface varies by around 0.7%, from 9.7639\u00a0m/s2 on the Nevado Huascar\u00e1n mountain in Peru to 9.8337\u00a0m/s2 at the surface of the Arctic Ocean.[6] In large cities, it ranges from 9.7806\u00a0m/s2 [7] in Kuala Lumpur, Mexico City, and Singapore to 9.825\u00a0m/s2 in Oslo and Helsinki.\n\n\n\n### Conventional value[edit]\n\n\nIn 1901 the third General Conference on Weights and Measures defined a standard gravitational acceleration for the surface of the Earth: *g*n\u00a0=\u00a09.80665\u00a0m/s2. It was based on measurements done at the Pavillon de Breteuil near Paris in 1888, with a theoretical correction applied in order to convert to a latitude of 45\u00b0 at sea level.[8] This definition is thus not a value of any particular place or carefully worked out average, but an agreement for a value to use if a better actual local value is not known or not important.[9] It is also used to define the units kilogram force and pound force.\n\n\nCalculating the gravity at Earth's surface using the average radius of Earth (6,371 kilometres (3,959\u00a0mi)),[10] the experimentally determined value of the gravitational constant, and the Earth mass of 5.9722 \u00d71024 kg gives an acceleration of 9.8203 m/s2,[11] slightly greater than the standard gravity of 9.80665 m/s2. The value of standard gravity corresponds to the gravity on Earth at a radius of 6,375.4 kilometres (3,961.5\u00a0mi).[11]\n\n\n\n### Latitude[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The differences of Earth's gravity around the Antarctic continent.\nThe surface of the Earth is rotating, so it is not an inertial frame of reference. At latitudes nearer the Equator, the outward centrifugal force produced by Earth's rotation is larger than at polar latitudes. This counteracts the Earth's gravity to a small degree \u2013 up to a maximum of 0.3% at the Equator \u2013 and reduces the apparent downward acceleration of falling objects.\n\n\nThe second major reason for the difference in gravity at different latitudes is that the Earth's equatorial bulge (itself also caused by centrifugal force from rotation) causes objects at the Equator to be further from the planet's center than objects at the poles. Because the force due to gravitational attraction between two bodies (the Earth and the object being weighed) varies inversely with the square of the distance between them, an object at the Equator experiences a weaker gravitational pull than an object on one of the poles.\n\n\nIn combination, the equatorial bulge and the effects of the surface centrifugal force due to rotation mean that sea-level gravity increases from about 9.780\u00a0m/s2 at the Equator to about 9.832\u00a0m/s2 at the poles, so an object will weigh approximately 0.5% more at the poles than at the Equator.[2][12]\n\n\n\n### Altitude[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The graph shows the variation in gravity relative to the height of an object above the surface\n![](image)Earth vs Mars vs Moon gravity at elevation\nGravity decreases with altitude as one rises above the Earth's surface because greater altitude means greater distance from the Earth's centre. All other things being equal, an increase in altitude from sea level to 9,000 metres (30,000\u00a0ft) causes a weight decrease of about 0.29%. (An additional factor affecting apparent weight is the decrease in air density at altitude, which lessens an object's buoyancy.[13] This would increase a person's apparent weight at an altitude of 9,000 metres by about 0.08%)\n\n\nIt is a common misconception that astronauts in orbit are weightless because they have flown high enough to escape the Earth's gravity. In fact, at an altitude of 400 kilometres (250\u00a0mi), equivalent to a typical orbit of the ISS, gravity is still nearly 90% as strong as at the Earth's surface. Weightlessness actually occurs because orbiting objects are in free-fall.[14]\n\n\nThe effect of ground elevation depends on the density of the ground (see Slab correction section). A person flying at 9,100\u00a0m (30,000\u00a0ft) above sea level over mountains will feel more gravity than someone at the same elevation but over the sea. However, a person standing on the Earth's surface feels less gravity when the elevation is higher.\n\n\nThe following formula approximates the Earth's gravity variation with altitude:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng\n\nh\n\n\n=\n\ng\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\nR\n\n\ne\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\ne\n\n\n\n+\nh\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g\\_{h}=g\\_{0}\\left({\\frac {R\\_{\\mathrm {e} }}{R\\_{\\mathrm {e} }+h}}\\right)^{2}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle g_{h}=g_{0}\\left({\\frac {R_{\\mathrm {e} }}{R_{\\mathrm {e} }+h}}\\right)^{2}}](image)\nWhere\n\n\n\n* *gh* is the gravitational acceleration at height h above sea level.\n* *R*e is the Earth's mean radius.\n* *g*0 is the standard gravitational acceleration.\n\n\nThe formula treats the Earth as a perfect sphere with a radially symmetric distribution of mass; a more accurate mathematical treatment is discussed below.\n\n\n\n### Depth[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gravity at different internal layers of Earth (1 = continental crust, 2 = oceanic crust, 3 = upper mantle, 4 = lower mantle, 5+6 = core, A = crust-mantle boundary)\n![](image)Earth's radial density distribution according to the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM).[15]\n![](image)Earth's gravity according to the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM).[15] Two models for a spherically symmetric Earth are included for comparison. The dark green straight line is for a constant density equal to the Earth's average density. The light green curved line is for a density that decreases linearly from center to surface. The density at the center is the same as in the PREM, but the surface density is chosen so that the mass of the sphere equals the mass of the real Earth.\nSee also: Shell theorem\n\nAn approximate value for gravity at a distance r from the center of the Earth can be obtained by assuming that the Earth's density is spherically symmetric. The gravity depends only on the mass inside the sphere of radius r. All the contributions from outside cancel out as a consequence of the inverse-square law of gravitation. Another consequence is that the gravity is the same as if all the mass were concentrated at the center. Thus, the gravitational acceleration at this radius is[16]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng\n(\nr\n)\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n\nG\nM\n(\nr\n)\n\n\nr\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g(r)=-{\\frac {GM(r)}{r^{2}}}.}\n\n![{\\displaystyle g(r)=-{\\frac {GM(r)}{r^{2}}}.}](image)\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and *M*(*r*) is the total mass enclosed within radius r.

The fluctuations are measured with highly sensitive gravimeters, the effect of topography and other known factors is subtracted, and from the resulting data conclusions are drawn. Such techniques are now used by prospectors to find oil and mineral deposits. Denser rocks (often containing mineral ores) cause higher than normal local gravitational fields on the Earth's surface. Less dense sedimentary rocks cause the opposite.\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of recent volcanic activity and ridge spreading. The areas where NASA GRACE measured gravity to be stronger than the theoretical gravity have a strong correlation with the positions of the volcanic activity and ridge spreading.\nThere is a strong correlation between the gravity derivation map of earth from NASA GRACE with positions of recent volcanic activity, ridge spreading and volcanos: these regions have a stronger gravitation than theoretical predictions.\n\n\n\n### Other factors[edit]\n\n\nIn air or water, objects experience a supporting buoyancy force which reduces the apparent strength of gravity (as measured by an object's weight). The magnitude of the effect depends on the air density (and hence air pressure) or the water density respectively; see Apparent weight for details.\n\n\nThe gravitational effects of the Moon and the Sun (also the cause of the tides) have a very small effect on the apparent strength of Earth's gravity, depending on their relative positions; typical variations are 2\u00a0\u00b5m/s2 (0.2 mGal) over the course of a day.\n\n\n\n## Direction[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vertical direction\n\n![](image)A plumb bob determines the local vertical direction\nGravity acceleration is a vector quantity, with direction in addition to magnitude. In a spherically symmetric Earth, gravity would point directly towards the sphere's centre. As the Earth's figure is slightly flatter, there are consequently significant deviations in the direction of gravity: essentially the difference between geodetic latitude and geocentric latitude. Smaller deviations, called vertical deflection, are caused by local mass anomalies, such as mountains.\n\n\n\n## Comparative values worldwide[edit]\n\n\nTools exist for calculating the strength of gravity at various cities around the world.[18] The effect of latitude can be clearly seen with gravity in high-latitude cities: Anchorage (9.826\u00a0m/s2), Helsinki (9.825\u00a0m/s2), being about 0.5% greater than that in cities near the equator: Kuala Lumpur (9.776\u00a0m/s2). The effect of altitude can be seen in Mexico City (9.776\u00a0m/s2; altitude 2,240 metres (7,350\u00a0ft)), and by comparing Denver (9.798\u00a0m/s2; 1,616 metres (5,302\u00a0ft)) with Washington, D.C. (9.801\u00a0m/s2; 30 metres (98\u00a0ft)), both of which are near 39\u00b0\u00a0N. Measured values can be obtained from Physical and Mathematical Tables by T.M. Yarwood and F.

that the gravity of a uniform spherical body, as measured on or above its surface, is the same as if all its mass were concentrated at a point at its centre. This is what allows us to use the Earth's radius for *r*.\n\n\nThe value obtained agrees approximately with the measured value of *g*. The difference may be attributed to several factors, mentioned above under \"Variations\":\n\n\n\n* The Earth is not homogeneous\n* The Earth is not a perfect sphere, and an average value must be used for its radius\n* This calculated value of *g* only includes true gravity. It does not include the reduction of constraint force that we perceive as a reduction of gravity due to the rotation of Earth, and some of gravity being counteracted by centrifugal force.\n\n\nThere are significant uncertainties in the values of *r* and *m*1 as used in this calculation, and the value of *G* is also rather difficult to measure precisely.\n\n\nIf *G*, *g* and *r* are known then a reverse calculation will give an estimate of the mass of the Earth. This method was used by Henry Cavendish.\n\n\n\n## Measurement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gravimetry\n\nThe measurement of Earth's gravity is called *gravimetry*.\n\n\n\n### Satellite measurements[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Gravimetry \u00a7 Satellite gravimetry.[edit]\n![](image)Gravity anomaly map from GRACE\nCurrently, the static and time-variable Earth's gravity field parameters are being determined using modern satellite missions, such as GOCE, CHAMP, Swarm, GRACE and GRACE-FO.[23][24] The lowest-degree parameters, including the Earth's oblateness and geocenter motion are best determined from satellite laser ranging.[25]\n\n\nLarge-scale gravity anomalies can be detected from space, as a by-product of satellite gravity missions, e.g., GOCE. These satellite missions aim at the recovery of a detailed gravity field model of the Earth, typically presented in the form of a spherical-harmonic expansion of the Earth's gravitational potential, but alternative presentations, such as maps of geoid undulations or gravity anomalies, are also produced.\n\n\n\nThe Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) consists of two satellites that can detect gravitational changes across the Earth. Also these changes can be presented as gravity anomaly temporal variations. The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) also consisted of two spacecraft orbiting the Moon, which orbited for three years before their deorbit in 2015.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Earth sciences portal\n\n\n* Escape velocity\u00a0\u2013 Concept in celestial mechanics\n\t+ Atmospheric escape\u00a0\u2013 Loss of planetary atmospheric gases to outer space\n* Figure of the Earth\u00a0\u2013 Size and shape used to model the Earth for geodesy\n* Geopotential\u00a0\u2013 Energy related to Earth's gravity\n\t+ Geopotential model\u00a0\u2013 Theoretical description of Earth's gravimetric shape\n\t+ Bouguer anomaly\u00a0\u2013 Type of gravity anomaly\n* Gravitation of the Moon\n* Gravitational acceleration\u00a0\u2013 Change in speed due only to gravity\n* Gravity\u00a0\u2013 Attraction of masses and energy\n* Gravity anomaly\u00a0\u2013 Difference between ideal and observed gravitational acceleration at a location\n* Gravity of Mars\u00a0\u2013 Gravitational force exerted by the planet Mars\n* Newton's law of universal gravitation\u00a0\u2013 Classical statement of gravity as force\n* Vertical deflection\u00a0\u2013 Measure of the downward gravitational force's shift due to nearby mass\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** NASA/JPL/University of Texas Center for Space Research. \"PIA12146: GRACE Global Gravity Animation\". *Photojournal*.

It is weaker than Earth's gravity due to the planet's smaller mass. The average gravitational acceleration on Mars is 3.72076 ms\u22122 (about 38% of that of Earth) and it varies.[1] In general, topography-controlled isostasy drives the short wavelength free-air gravity anomalies.[2] At the same time, convective flow and finite strength of the mantle lead to long-wavelength planetary-scale free-air gravity anomalies over the entire planet.[3][4] Variation in crustal thickness, magmatic and volcanic activities, impact-induced Moho-uplift, seasonal variation of polar ice caps, atmospheric mass variation and variation of porosity of the crust could also correlate to the lateral variations.[5][6][7][8][9] Over the years models consisting of an increasing but limited number of spherical harmonics have been produced. Maps produced have included free-air gravity anomaly, Bouguer gravity anomaly, and crustal thickness. In some areas of Mars there is a correlation between gravity anomalies and topography. Given the known topography, higher resolution gravity field can be inferred. Tidal deformation of Mars by the Sun or Phobos can be measured by its gravity. This reveals how stiff the interior is, and shows that the core is partially liquid.\nThe study of surface gravity of Mars can therefore yield information about different features and provide beneficial information for future landings.\n\n\n\n\n## Measurement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rotating spherical harmonic, with \n\n\n\n\u2113\n=\n0\n\n\u00a0to\u00a0\n\n4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ell =0{\\text{ to }}4}\n\n![{\\displaystyle \\ell =0{\\text{ to }}4}](image) for the vertical, and \n\n\n\nm\n=\n0\n\n\u00a0to\u00a0\n\n4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m=0{\\text{ to }}4}\n\n![{\\displaystyle m=0{\\text{ to }}4}](image) for the horizontal. For the Martian C20 and C30, they vary with time because of the seasonal variation of mass of the polar ice caps through the annual sublimation-condensation cycle of carbon dioxide.\nTo understand the gravity of Mars, its gravitational field strength *g* and gravitational potential *U* are often measured. Simply, if Mars is assumed to be a static perfectly spherical body of radius *RM*, provided that there is only one satellite revolving around Mars in a circular orbit and such gravitation interaction is the only force acting in the system, the equation would be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\nM\nm\n\n\nr\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n=\nm\nr\n\n\u03c9\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {GMm}{r^{2}}}=mr\\omega ^{2},}\n\n![{\\displaystyle {\\frac {GMm}{r^{2}}}=mr\\omega ^{2},}](image)\nwhere *G* is the universal constant of gravitation (commonly taken as *G* = 6.674 \u00d7 10\u221211 m3 kg\u22121 s\u22122),[10] *M* is the mass of Mars (most updated value: 6.41693 \u00d7 1023 kg),[11] *m* is the mass of the satellite, *r* is the distance between Mars and the satellite, and \n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\omega }\n\n![{\\displaystyle \\omega }](image) is the angular velocity of the satellite, which is also equivalent to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\nT\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {2\\pi }{T}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle {\\frac {2\\pi }{T}}}](image) (*T* is the orbiting period of the satellite).\n\n\nTherefore, \n\n\n\ng\n=\n\n\n\nG\nM\n\n\nR\n\nM\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n3\n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nR\n\nM\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n4\n\nr\n\n3\n\n\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n2\n\n\n\nR\n\nM\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g={\\frac {GM}{R\\_{M}^{2}}}={\\frac {r^{3}\\omega ^{2}}{R\\_{M}^{2}}}={\\frac {4r^{3}\\pi ^{2}}{T^{2}R\\_{M}^{2}}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle g={\\frac {GM}{R_{M}^{2}}}={\\frac {r^{3}\\omega ^{2}}{R_{M}^{2}}}={\\frac {4r^{3}\\pi ^{2}}{T^{2}R_{M}^{2}}}}](image), where *RM* is the radius of Mars.

(Credit: NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio)\n### Earth-based observation[edit]\n\n\nBefore the arrival of the Mariner 9 and Viking orbiter spacecraft at Mars, only an estimate of the Mars gravitational constant GM, i.e. the universal constant of gravitation times the mass of Mars, was available for deducing the properties of the Martian gravity field.[14] GM could be obtained through observations of the motions of the natural satellites of Mars (Phobos and Deimos) and spacecraft flybys of Mars (Mariner 4 and Mariner 6).[14]\n\n\nLong term Earth-based observations of the motions of Phobos and Deimos provide physical parameters including semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination angle to the Laplacian plane etc.,[15] which allow calculation of the ratio of solar mass to the mass of Mars, moment of inertia and coefficient of the gravitational potential of Mars, and give initial estimates of the gravity field of Mars.[15]\n\n\n\n### Inferred from radio tracking data[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Three-way Doppler, with signal transmitter and receiver separated\nPrecise tracking of spacecraft is of prime importance for accurate gravity modeling, as gravity models are developed from observing tiny perturbation of spacecraft, i.e. small variation in velocity and altitude. The tracking is done basically by the antennae of the Deep Space Network (DSN), with one-way, two-way and three-way Doppler and range tracking applied.[16] One-way tracking means the data is transmitted in one way to the DSN from the spacecraft, while two-way and three-way involve transmitting signals from Earth to the spacecraft (uplink), and thereafter transponded coherently back to the Earth (downlink).[16] The difference between two-way and three-way tracking is, the former one has the same signal transmitter and receiver on Earth, while the latter one has the transmitter and receiver at different locations on Earth.[16] The use of these three types of tracking data enhances the coverage and quality of the data, as one could fill in the data gap of another.[16]\n\n\nDoppler tracking is a common technique in tracking the spacecraft, utilizing radial velocity method, which involves detection of Doppler shifts.[13] As the spacecraft moves away from us along line of sight, there would be redshift of signal, while for the reverse, there would be blueshift of signal. Such technique has also been applied for observation of the motion of exoplanets.[17] While for the range tracking, it is done through measurement of round trip propagation time of the signal.[13] Combination of Doppler shift and range observation promotes higher tracking accuracy of the spacecraft.\n\n\nThe tracking data would then be converted to develop global gravity models using the spherical harmonic equation displayed above. However, further elimination of the effects due to affect of solid tide, various relativistic effects due to the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn, non-conservative forces (e.g. angular momentum desaturations (AMD), atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure) have to be done,[13] otherwise, considerable errors result.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **is missing information** about alternative nomenclature such as GMM-3 as mgm1025, used in some NASA papers and in its planetary data system.

The better technique favors spherical harmonic solutions to higher degrees and orders. Independent analysis on Mariner 9 and Viking Orbiter tracking data yielded a degree and order of 6 spherical harmonic solution.,[18] Further combination of the two data sets, along with correlation of anomalies with volcanic features (positive anomaly) and deep-printed depression (negative anomaly) assisted by image data allows a degree and order of 18 spherical harmonic solution produced.[19] Further use of spatial a priori constraint method, which had taken the topography into account in solving the Kaula power law constraint, had favored model of up to degree 50 spherical harmonic solution in global resolution (Goddard Mars Model-1, or GMM-1)[20] then the subsequent models with higher completeness and degree and order up to 120 for the latest GMM-3.[13]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mars free-air gravity map produced along with the GMM-3 gravity solution[13] (Red: gravity high; Blue: gravity low) (Credit: NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio)\nTherefore, gravity models nowadays are not directly produced through transfer of the measured gravity data to any spatial information system because there is difficulty in producing model with sufficiently high resolution. Topography data obtained from the MOLA instrument aboard the Mars Global Surveyor thus becomes a useful tool in producing a more detailed short-scale gravity model, utilizing the gravity-topography correlation in short-wavelength.[13] However, not all regions on Mars show such correlation, notably the northern lowland and the poles.[13] Misleading results could be easily produced, which could lead to wrong geophysics interpretation.[13]\n\n\nThe later modifications of gravity model include taking other non-conservative forces acting on spacecraft into account, including atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, Mars reflected solar radiation pressure, Mars thermal emission, and spacecraft thrusting which despins or desaturates the angular moment wheels.[14] In addition, Martian precession and third body attraction due to the Sun, Moon and planets, which could affect the spacecraft orbit, as well as relavistic effects on the measurements should also be corrected.[7] These factors could lead to offset of the true gravity field. Accurate modeling is thus required to eliminate the offset. Such work is still ongoing.\n\n\n\n## Static gravity field[edit]\n\n\nMany researchers have outlined the correlation between short-wavelength (locally varying) free-air gravity anomalies and topography. For regions with higher correlation, free-air gravity anomalies could be expanded to higher degree strength through geophysical interpretation of surface features,[13] so that the gravity map could offer higher resolution. It has been found that the southern highland has high gravity/topography correlation but not for the northern lowland.[13] Therefore, the resolution of free-air gravity anomaly model typically has higher resolution for the southern hemisphere, as high as over 100\u00a0km.[13]\n\n\nFree-air gravity anomalies are relatively easier to measure than the Bouguer anomalies as long as topography data is available because it does not need to eliminate the gravitational effect due to the effect of mass surplus or deficit of the terrain after the gravity is reduced to sea level. However, to interpret the crustal structure, further elimination of such gravitational effect is necessary so that the reduced gravity would only be the result of the core, mantle and crust below datum.[5] The product after elimination is the Bouguer anomalies. However, density of the material in building up the terrain would be the most important constraint in the calculation, which may vary laterally on the planet and is affected by porosity and geochemistry of the rock.[5][9] Relevant information could be obtained from Martian meteorites and in-situ analysis.\n\n\n\n### Local gravity anomalies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The crust-mantle boundary variation, intrusion, volcanism and topography can bring effect to the orbit of spacecraft, due to the higher density of mantle and volcanic material and lower density of the crust. (Not in scale) +ve: Positive anomaly; -ve: Negative anomaly\nSince Bouguer gravity anomalies have strong links with depth of crust-mantle boundary, one with positive Bouguer anomalies may mean that it has a thinner crust composed of lower density material and is influenced more strongly by the denser mantle, and vice versa. However, it could also be contributed by the difference in density of the erupted volcanic load and sedimentary load, as well as subsurface intrusion and removal of material.[5][6][25] Many of these anomalies are associated with either geological or topographic features.[5] Few exception includes the 63\u00b0E, 71\u00b0N anomaly,[5] which may represent an extensive buried structure as large as over 600\u00a0km, predated the early-Noachian buried surface.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Topography anomalies[edit]\n\n\nStrong correlation between topography and short-wavelength free-air gravity anomalies has been shown for both study of the gravity field of the Earth and the Moon,[2] and it can be explained by the wide occurrence of isostasy.[2][26] High correlation is expected for degree over 50 (short-wavelength anomaly) on Mars.[13] And it could be as high as 0.9 for degrees between 70 and 85.[13] Such correlation could be explained by flexural compensation of topographic loads.[2][26] It is noted that older regions on Mars are isostatically compensated when the younger region are usually only partially compensated.[13]\n\n\n\n#### Anomalies from volcanic constructs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mars Bouguer gravity map, produced along with GMM-3 gravity solution in 2016[13](Red: gravity high; Blue: gravity low) (Credit: NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio)\nDifferent volcanic constructs could behave differently in terms of gravity anomalies. Volcanoes Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes produce the smallest positive free-air gravity anomalies in the solar system.[5] Alba Patera, also a volcanic rise, north of the Tharsis Montes, however, produces negative Bouguer anomaly, though its extension is similar to that of Olympus Mons.[5] And for the Elysium Mons, its center is found to have slight increase in Bouguer anomalies in an overall broad negative anomaly context in the Elysium rise.[5]\n\n\nThe knowledge of anomaly of volcanoes, along with density of the volcanic material, would be useful in determining the lithospheric composition and crustal evolution of different volcanic edifices.[27] It has been suggested that the extruded lava could range from andesite (low density) to basaltic (high density) and the composition could change during the construction of the volcanic shield, which contributes to the anomaly.[27] Another scenario is it is possible for high density material intruded beneath the volcano.[27][6] Such setting has already been observed over the famous Syrtis major, which has been inferred to have an extinct magma chamber with 3300\u00a0kg m3 underlying the volcano, evident from positive Bouguer anomaly.[6]\n\n\n\n#### Anomalies from depressions[edit]\n\n\nDifferent depressions also behave differently in Bouguer anomaly. Giant impact basins like Argyre, Isidis, Hellas and Utopia basins also exhibit very strong positive Bouguer anomalies in circular manner.[5] These basins have been debated for their impact crater origin. If they are, the positive anomalies may be due to uplift of Moho, crustal thinning and modification events by sedimentary and volcanic surface loads after impacting.[5][25]\n\n\nBut at the same time there are also some large basins that are not associated with such positive Bouguer anomaly, for example, Daedalia, northern Tharsis and Elysium, which are believed to be underlain by the northern lowland plain.[5]\n\n\nIn addition, certain portions of Coprates, Eos Chasma and Kasei Valles are also found to have positive Bouguer anomalies,[5] though they are topographic depressions. This may suggest that these depressions are underlain by shallow dense intrusion body.[5]\n\n\n\n### Global gravity anomalies[edit]\n\n\nGlobal gravity anomalies, also termed as long-wavelength gravity anomalies, are the low-degree harmonics of the gravity field,[4] which cannot be attributed to local isostasy, but rather finite strength of the mantle and density differences in the convection current.[13][3][4] For Mars, the largest component of Bouguer anomaly is the degree one harmonic, which represents the mass deficit in the southern hemisphere and excess in the northern hemisphere.[5] The second largest component corresponds to the planet flattening and Tharsis bulge.[5]\n\n\nEarly study of the geoid in the 1950s and 1960s has focused on the low-degree harmonics of the Earth's gravity field in order to understand its interior structure.[4] It has been suggested that such long-wavelength anomalies on Earth could be contributed by the sources located in deep mantle and not in the crust, for example, caused by the density differences in driving the convection current,[4][28] which has been evolving with time. The correlation between certain topography anomalies and long-wavelength gravity anomalies, for example, the mid-Atlantic ridge and Carlsberg ridge, which are topography high and gravity high on the ocean floor, thus became the argument for the convection current idea on Earth in the 1970s,[29][30] though such correlations are weak in the global picture.\n\n\nAnother possible explanation for the global scale anomalies is the finite strength of the mantle (in contrast to zero stress), which makes the gravity deviated from hydrostatic equilibrium.[3] For this theory, because of the finite strength, flow may not exist for most of the region that are understressed.[3] And the variations of density of the deep mantle could be the result of chemical inhomogeneities associated with continent separations,[3] and scars left on Earth after the torn away of the moon.[3] These are the cases suggested to work when slow flow is allowed to happen under certain circumstances.[3] However, it has been argued that the theory may not be physically feasible.[4]\n\n\n\n## Time-variable gravity field[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sublimation-condensation cycle occurs on Mars which results in carbon dioxide exchange between the cryosphere and the atmosphere. In turn, there is exchange in mass between the two spheres, which gives seasonal variation of gravity. (Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n### Seasonal change of gravity field at the poles[edit]\n\n\nThe sublimation-condensation cycle of carbon dioxide on Mars between the atmosphere and cryosphere (polar ice cap) operates seasonally.[8] This cycle contributes as almost the only variable accounting for changes in gravity field on Mars.[8] The measured gravitational potential of Mars from orbiters could be generalized as the equation below,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n(\n\nMars\n\n)\n=\nV\n(\n\nsolid planet\n\n)\n+\nV\n(\n\nseasonal caps\n\n+\n\natmosphere\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V({\\text{Mars}})=V({\\text{solid planet}})+V({\\text{seasonal caps}}+{\\text{atmosphere}})}\n\n![{\\displaystyle V({\\text{Mars}})=V({\\text{solid planet}})+V({\\text{seasonal caps}}+{\\text{atmosphere}})}](image)[8]\nIn turn, when there is more mass in the seasonal caps due to the more condensation of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the mass of the atmosphere would drop. They have inverse relationship with each other. And the change in mass has direct effect towards the measured gravitational potential.\n\n\nThe seasonal mass exchange between the northern polar cap and southern polar cap exhibits long-wavelength gravity variation with time.[8][13] Long years of continuous observation has found that the determination of even zonal, normalized gravity coefficient Cl=2, m=0, and odd zonal, normalized gravity coefficient Cl=3, m=0 are crucial for outlining the time-variable gravity due to such mass exchange,[24][8][31][32] where \n\n\n\nl\n\n\n{\\displaystyle l}\n\n![{\\displaystyle l}](image) is the degree while \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n![{\\displaystyle m}](image) is the order.

Usually k2 can tell quadrupolar deformation.[13] Finding k2 is helpful in understanding the interior structure on Mars.[13] The most updated k2 obtained by Genova's team is 0.1697 \u00b1 0.0009.[13] As if k2 is smaller than 0.10 a solid core would be indicated, this tells that at least the outer core is liquid on Mars,[31] and the predicted core radius is 1520\u20131840\u00a0km.[31]\n\n\nHowever, current radio tracking data from MGS, ODY and MRO does not allow the effect of phase lag on the tides to be detected because it is too weak and needs more precise measurement on the perturbation of spacecraft in the future.[13]\n\n\n\n## Geophysical implications[edit]\n\n\n### Crustal thickness[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Histogram of percentage area against crustal thickness of Mars: 32\u00a0km and 58\u00a0km are the two major peaks of the histogram.\n![](image)Comparison of topography, free-air gravity anomaly and crustal density map \u2013 Red: gravity high; Blue: gravity low\nNo direct measurement of crustal thickness on Mars is currently available. Geochemical implications from SNC meteorites and orthopyroxenite meteorite ALH84001 suggested that mean crustal thickness of Mars is 100\u2013250\u00a0km.[33] Viscous relaxation analysis suggested that the maximum thickness is 50\u2013100\u00a0km. Such thickness is critical in maintaining hemispheric crustal variations and preventing channel flow.[34] Combination studies on geophysics and geochemistry suggested that average crustal thickness could be down to 50 \u00b1 12\u00a0km.[35]\n\n\nMeasurement of gravity field by different orbiters allows higher-resolution global Bouguer potential model to be produced.[5] With local shallow density anomalies and effect of core flattening eliminated,[5] the residual Bouguer potential is produced, as indicated by the following equation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU\n\nR\nB\n\n\n=\n\nU\n\nB\n\n\n\u2212\n\nU\n\ncore\n\n\n\u2212\n\nU\n\nlocal\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle U\\_{RB}=U\\_{B}-U\\_{\\text{core}}-U\\_{\\text{local}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle U_{RB}=U_{B}-U_{\\text{core}}-U_{\\text{local}}}](image)[5]\nThe residual Bouguer potential is contributed by the mantle.[5] The undulation of the crust-mantle boundary, or the Moho surface, with mass of terrain corrected, should have resulted in varying residual anomaly.[5] In turn, if undulating boundary is observed, there should be changes in crustal thickness.\n\n\nGlobal study of residual Bouguer anomaly data indicates that crustal thickness of Mars varies from 5.8\u00a0km to 102\u00a0km.[5] Two major peaks at 32\u00a0km and 58\u00a0km are identified from an equal-area histogram of crustal thickness.[5] These two peaks are linked to the crustal dichotomy of Mars.[5] Almost all the crust thicker than 60\u00a0km are contributed by the southern highland, with generally uniform thickness.[5] And the northern lowland in general has thinner crust. The crustal thickness of the Arabia Terra region and northern hemisphere are found to be latitude-dependent.[5] The more southward towards the Sinai Planum and Lunae Planum, the more thickened the crust is.[5]\n\n\nAmong all regions, the Thaumasia and Claritis contain the thickest portion of crust on Mars that account for the histogram > 70\u00a0km.[5] The Hellas and Argyre basins are observed to have crust thinner than 30\u00a0km,[5] which are the exceptionally thin area in the southern hemisphere.[5] Isidis and Utopia are also observed to have significant crustal thinning,[5] with the center of Isidis basins believed to have the thinnest crust on Mars.[5]\n\n\n\n### Crust redistribution by impacting and viscous relaxation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)After the initial impact, high heat flux and high water content would have favored viscous relaxation to take place. The crust becomes more ductile. The basin topography of the craters is thus subjected to greater stress due to self-gravitation, which further drive crustal flow and decay of relief. However, this analysis may not work for giant impact craters such as Hellas, Utopia, Argyre and Isidis basins.[25]\nCrustal thinning is believed to have taken place underneath almost all the major impact craters.[5] Crustal excavation, modification through emplacement of volcanic material and crustal flow taking place in the weak lithosphere are the possible causes.[5] With the pre-impact crust excavated, gravitational restoration would take place through central mantle uplift, so that the mass deficit of cavity could be compensated by the mass of the uplifted denser material.[5]\n\n\nGiant impact basins Utopia, Hellas, Argyre and Isidis are some of the most prominent examples.[5] Utopia, an impact basin located in northern lowland, is filled by light and water-deposited sedimentary material and has slightly thickened crust at the center.[5] This is potentially due to large resurfacing process in the northern lowland.[5] While for Hellas, Argyre and Isidis basins, they have great Moho uplifted relief and exhibit annuli of diffuse thickened crust beyond the crustal rim.[5]\n\n\nBut on the contrary, almost all the Martian basins with diameter of 275\u00a0km < *D* < 1000\u00a0km are associated with low amplitude surface and low amplitude Moho relief.[25] Many are even found to have negative free air gravity anomaly, though evidence has shown that all of them should have experienced gravity high (positive free air gravity anomaly).[25] These have been suggested not caused by erosion and burial alone, as the adding of material into the basin would in fact increase the gravity strength rather than decrease it.[25] Thus viscous relaxation should have been taking place.[25] High heat flux and high water content in the early Martian crust favored viscous relaxation.[25] These two factors have made the crust more ductile. The basin topography of the craters would be subjected to greater stress due to self-gravitation. Such stress would drive crustal flow and therefore decay of relief. The giant impact basins are the exceptions that have not experienced viscous relaxation, as crustal thinning has made the crust too thin to sustain sub-solidus crustal flow.[5][25]\n\n\n\n### Low bulk crustal density[edit]\n\n\nThe most recent crustal density model RM1 developed in 2017 gives the bulk crustal density to be 2582 \u00b1 209\u00a0kg m\u22123 for Mars,[9] which represents a global average value.[9] Lateral variation of the crustal density should exist.[9] For example, over the volcanic complexes, local density is expected to be as high as 3231 \u00b1 95\u00a0kg m\u22123,[9] which matched the meteorite data and previous estimations. In addition, the density of the northern hemisphere is in general higher than that of the southern hemisphere,[9] which may imply that the latter is more porous than the former.\n\n\nTo achieve the bulk value, porosity could play an important role. If the mineral grain density is chosen to be 3100\u00a0kg m\u22123,[9] 10% to 23% porosity could give a 200\u00a0kg m\u22123 drop in the bulk density.[9] If the pore spaces are filled with water or ice, bulk density decrease is also expected.[9] A further drop in bulk density could be explained by increasing density with depth,[9] with the surface layer more porous than the deeper Mars, and the increase of density with depth also has geographical variation.[9]\n\n\n\n## Engineering and scientific applications[edit]\n\n\n### Areoid[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Geography of Mars \u00a7\u00a0Zero elevation, and Mars \u00a7\u00a0Geography\n\nFurther information: Vertical datum\n\nThe **areoid** is a planetary geoid that represents the gravitational and rotational equipotential figure of Mars, analogous to the concept of geoid (\"sea level\") on Earth.[5][36][37] This has been set as the reference frame for developing the MOLA Mission Experiment Gridded Data Records (MEGDRs),[5][36] which is a global topography model. The topography model is important in mapping the geomorphological features and understanding different kinds of processes on Mars.\n\n\nTo derive the areoid, two parts of works are required. First, as gravity data is essential for identifying the position of the center of mass of the planet,[36] which is largely affected by the distribution of the mass of the interior, radio tracking data of spacecraft is necessary.[36] This was largely done by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS).[5][36] Then, the MOLA 2 instrument aboard the MGS, which operates at 400-km elevation orbit, could measure the range (distance) between the spacecraft and the ground surface through counting the round-trip time of flight of the pulse from the instrument.[36] Combination of these two works allows the areoid as well as the MEGDRs to be constructed.\nBased on the above, the areoid has taken the radius as the mean radius of the planet at the equator as 3396\u00a0km.[5][36]\n\n\n\n![](image)The topography model MEDGRs was developed through range (distance) measurement done by MOLA 2 instrument and radio tracking data of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS).[36] The highest point is located at the Olympus Mons while the deepest point is located within the Hellas Basin.[36](Brown-Red: Topography high; Green-Blue: Topography low) (Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n### Surface landing[edit]\n\n\nAs there is a large distance between Mars and Earth, immediate command to the lander is almost impossible and the landing relies highly on its autonomous system. It has been recognized that to avoid failure, precise understanding of the gravity field of Mars is essential for the landing projects, so that offsetting factors and uncertainties of gravitational effects could be minimized, allowing for a smooth landing progress.[38][39] The first ever man-made object landing on Mars, the Mars 2 lander, crashed for an unknown reason. Since the surface environment of Mars is complex, composed of laterally varying morphological patterns, in order to avoid rock hazard the landing progress should be further assisted by employment of LIDAR on site in determining the exact landing position and other protective measures.[38][39]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Hirt, C.; Claessens, S.J.; Kuhn, M.; Featherstone, W.E.
