As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place includes cities, towns, villages, boroughs, and municipalities.[a] A few exceptional census-designated places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places.[b] Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county, or county equivalent. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places. This list presents only the portion of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place.\n\n\nThis list refers only to the population of individual municipalities within their defined limits; the populations of other municipalities considered suburbs of a central city are listed separately, and unincorporated areas within urban agglomerations are not included. Therefore, a different ranking is evident when considering U.S. urban areas or metropolitan areas.\n\n\n\n\n## 50 states and Washington, D.C.[edit]\n\n\n\nThis table lists the 333 incorporated places in the United States, excluding the U.S. territories, with a population of at least 100,000 as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Five states have no cities with populations exceeding 100,000. They are: Delaware, Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\n\nThe table displays:\n\n\n\n1. The city rank by population as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau[1]\n2. The city name[1]\n3. The name of the state in which the city lies[1]\n4. The city population as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau[1]\n5. The city population as of April 1, 2020, as enumerated by the 2020 United States census[1]\n6. The city percent population change from April 1, 2020, to July 1, 2022\n7. The city land area as of January 1, 2020[2]\n8.

A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served on the Phoenix City Council from 2014 to 2018.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGallego grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[2] Her parents are attorneys who moved to Albuquerque from Chicago after the 1979 Chicago blizzard.[3][4] She grew up with asthma, which made air quality important to her.[5]\n\n\nGallego graduated from Albuquerque Academy, where she served as student body vice president.[3] She earned a bachelor's degree in environmental science and public policy from Harvard College and a Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[3][6]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nGallego worked for the Arizona Democratic Party, the Arizona Office of Tourism,[5] as well as on economic development and strategic planning for the Salt River Project. On November 5, 2013, Gallego was elected to the Phoenix City Council for the 8th district; she was reelected in 2017. With Greg Stanton, the Mayor of Phoenix, running for the United States House of Representatives in the 2018 elections, Gallego announced she would run in a special election to succeed him.[7] She resigned from the city council effective August 7, 2018.[8]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nThe city of Phoenix has nonpartisan mayoral elections. In the 2018 special election, Kate Gallego and Daniel Valenzuela advanced to a runoff in November of 2018. They defeated Moses Sanchez and Nicholas Sarwark. Although the election was nonpartisan, both candidates were Democrats. Previously on the city council, they had voted similarly. Kate Gallego defeated Daniel Valenzuela in the special general runoff election for the mayor of Phoenix in 2019. She received 58.6% of votes.[9] She assumed office on March 21, 2019. Gallego became the first woman elected to the office in more than three decades. She is only the second female mayor in Phoenix history and one of the youngest big city mayors in the United States.[10] She was backed by progressives, labor unions, the *Arizona Republic* editorial board, and liberal advocacy organizations. Examples of these include Emily's List, Sierra Club, and the Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona.[11]\n\n\nIn 2020, Kate Gallego ran for re-election. In November 2020, she was returned to office with the highest number of votes ever cast in a mayoral election. Merissa Hamilton, a Libertarian write in candidate, was Gallego's closest opponent. Hamilton received 26.29% of votes. Gallego won the election receiving 60.7% of the votes.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gallego tours GateWay Community College with Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nDuring Gallego's tenure as mayor, Phoenix has taken steps to counter the urban heat island effects which are aggravated by climate change.[13] Increasing temperatures in the Phoenix area are projected to cost billions of dollars per year.[14] Among the steps being taken are the creation of \"cool corridors\" through the planting of desert-adapted trees, and the use of lighter-colored sidewalks and streets, particularly in areas with high pedestrian traffic and little shade. Where to plant the trees is determined in part based on \"tree equity.\" The city uses an interactive tool from the nonprofit American Forests that grades shade in neighborhoods based on satellite images.[13][14] Phoenix has also opened one of the first city heat mitigation offices in the United States. It will support climate mitigation in Phoenix and share strategies with individuals and cities worldwide.[15]\n\n\n\n### Policing[edit]\n\n\nThe police department of Phoenix recorded shooting 44 people in 2018, spurring a reassessment from the community on police accountability. In 2020, Gallego suggested a plan for a citizens review board that would balance the police department interests and community interests. City councilman Carlos Garcia, who ran on further police accountability, created a plan focused on empowering a citizens review board from input of the community and groups such as Puente Human Rights and Poder in Action. The city council passed Garcia's model for a review board when Gallego and vice mayor Betty Guardados switched their votes from Gallego's model to the Garcia model with a 5\u20134 vote.[16]\n\n\nA Department of Justice investigation was initiated in August 2021 looking into if the police used excessive force on protestors and sweeping of homeless people and their property. The investigation planned to look at current police practices and its handling of the disabled.[17][18]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nGallego supported legislation that legalized accessory dwelling units on lots that were previously strictly zoned for single-family housing.[19]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGallego is Jewish,[4] celebrating her bat mitzvah in Albuquerque.[3]\n\n\nWhile attending Harvard, Kate met Ruben Gallego at a charity auction following the September 11 attacks.[5] They moved to Phoenix in 2004,[2] and married in 2010. The couple announced their divorce in 2016, prior to the birth of their child, Michael.[20]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Phi Beta Kappa elects 92 seniors to Harvard chapter\". *The Harvard Gazette*.

The current mayor of Philadelphia is Jim Kenney, whose term as mayor expires in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nThe first mayor of Philadelphia was Humphrey Morrey, who was appointed to the position by William Penn, the founder of the city and the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania, which became the state of Pennsylvania following the American Revolutionary War. Penn subsequently appointed Edward Shippen under the city charter of 1701. The Philadelphia City Council then elected Shippen to a second term. Subsequent mayors, who held office for one year, were elected by the Philadelphia City Council. The initial mayors of Philadelphia were not compensated and candidates sometimes objected strongly to being selected to the position, sometimes choosing even to pay a fine rather than serve in the position.\n\n\nIn 1704, alderman Griffith Jones was elected but declined to serve, for which he was fined twenty pounds. In 1706, Alderman Thomas Story was similarly fined for refusing office. In 1745, Alderman Abraham Taylor was fined thirty pounds for refusing the mayoralty; Council then elected Joseph Turner, who also refused and was likewise fined.[2] Others who refused election included Richard Hill (1717), Isaac Norris (1722), John Mifflin, and Alexander Stedman, while William Coxe pleaded illness (1758), Samuel Mifflin (1761), William Coxe and Daniel Benezet (1762), and John Barclay and George Roberts (1792). Robert Wharton declined in 1800 and 1811, amid serving for 14 one-year terms, making him the most-often-elected (16 times, including refusals) and longest-serving (14 years) mayor of Philadelphia.[3]\n\n\nIn 1747, at the request of retiring Mayor William Attwood, Council resolved to institute an annual salary of 100 pounds for the office.[2] Nevertheless, that same year, Anthony Morris secretly fled to Bucks County to avoid being notified of his election to the mayoralty. When he could not be located after three days, a new election had to be arranged, and Attwood was re-elected to a second term.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1826, Council could elect any citizen of Philadelphia to the mayoralty. From 1839, mayors were elected by popular vote. If no candidate won a majority of the popular vote, then the joint Councils (Select and Common) would decide between the two leading candidates. John Swift was the first mayor to be elected directly by the people in the 1840 election.\n\n\nThe term of office was extended to two years in 1854, three years in 1861, and four years in 1885. Further, The Act of 1885 prohibited mayors from succeeding themselves.[4]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nThe restriction was lifted in the 1940s allowing Bernard Samuel to run for re-election. In 1951, the city's Home Rule Charter established a two-term limit for mayors.[4] The term limit is consecutive, not lifetime. \n\n\nThe mayorship of Philadelphia has been held by Democrats since 1952. The only Republican who has come close to winning the position was Sam Katz, who in 1999 came within half a percentage point of being the first Republican mayor of Philadelphia elected in over 45 years.\n\n\n\n## List of Mayors[edit]\n\n\nParties\n\u00a0\u00a0Democratic (16) \n\u00a0\u00a0Democratic-Republican (4) \n\u00a0\u00a0Federalist (6) \n\u00a0\u00a0Keystone (1) \n\u00a0\u00a0National

Prior to his election, Nirenberg served as a member of the San Antonio City Council for District 8 for two terms.[2]\n\n\nIn 2013, Nirenberg was first elected in an upset victory to represent district 8 of the San Antonio City Council. Nirenberg was elected mayor in 2017, defeating incumbent Ivy Taylor, and was sworn in as the mayor of San Antonio on June 21, 2017.[3] He was narrowly re-elected in 2019 facing Greg Brockhouse, a city councilman critical of his policies. In the 2021 mayoral election, again, against Brockhouse, Nirenberg won with 61.89% of the vote. In the 2023 mayoral election, Nirenberg won his fourth and final election as mayor, with unofficial results of over 61% of the vote.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nNirenberg is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Poland and Russia) on his father's side and of mixed Filipino, Malay, Indian, and British heritage from his mother's side.[5] Nirenberg's mother and father met while the couple was serving with the Peace Corps in Malaysia.[6] His paternal grandparents immigrated to the United States before World War II, passing through Ellis Island. His Roman Catholic mother is half-Filipino and was born in Penang, Malaysia (then part of the colonial British protectorate of Malaya). His maternal grandmother was Anglo-Indian, born to a Scottish father and an Indian mother, while his maternal grandfather was a Tagalog-speaking Filipino musician with possible roots in Mindanao.[7] Nirenberg, who is Methodist, was raised in Austin, Texas.\n\n\nNirenberg attended Trinity University in San Antonio and graduated *summa cum laude* with a Bachelor of Arts in communication. He later attended the University of Pennsylvania, from which he earned his Master of Arts in communications.[8] After college, he was a program director for the Annenberg Public Policy Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania[9] and served as the General Manager of KRTU-FM, the radio station at Trinity University.[10]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n### 2013 San Antonio City Council, District 8 race[edit]\n\n\nIn his 2013 run for District 8 of the San Antonio City Council, Nirenberg was considered the underfunded candidate unlikely to be successful that was challenging a well-funded establishment candidate, Rolando Briones. Nirenberg had run a grassroots campaign that consisted primarily of volunteers, including college students and recent graduates. Nonetheless, Nirenberg was victorious winning nearly 55% of the votes cast in the runoff election.[11]\n\n\n\n### 2017 San Antonio mayoral race[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2017 San Antonio mayoral election\n\nOn December 10, 2016, Nirenberg became the leading challenger to Ivy Taylor for her position as mayor of San Antonio.[12] On May 6, 2017, the first round of voting was held, with no candidate reaching the required majority of 50% of the vote. Nirenberg and Taylor finished with the two highest vote totals and advanced to a runoff election held June 10, 2017. Although Nirenberg trailed Taylor in the first municipal election, he went on to defeat Taylor 54.59\u201345.41% in the runoff election.[13] In so doing, Nirenberg became the first person in twenty years to defeat an incumbent mayor of San Antonio who sought re-election.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### 2019 San Antonio mayoral race[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 San Antonio mayoral election\n\nNirenberg declared his candidacy for re-election to the office on January 29, 2019.[16] His main opponent was identified as Greg Brockhouse, a member of the San Antonio City Council who also took office in 2017 and frequently objected to Nirenberg's platform.[17] The election was scheduled for May 4, 2019, but since no majority was reached by any candidate, a runoff election was held on June 8.[18] In the runoff, Nirenberg was elected to a second term, defeating Brockhouse by a 51.11% to 48.89% final vote.[19]\n\n\n\n### 2021 San Antonio mayoral race[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 San Antonio mayoral election\n\nNirenberg declared his candidacy for re-election for a third term in office on January 22, 2021.[20] The election was held on May 1, 2021.[21] Due to the close runoff in 2019 between Nirenberg and Brockhouse, they were considered by political watchers to be the two front-runner candidates in the election.[22] Nirenberg won his third term as mayor with 61.89% of the vote, while Brockhouse received 31.26%.[23]\n\n\n\n### 2023 San Antonio mayoral race[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 San Antonio mayoral election\n\nNirenberg declared his candidacy for re-election for a fourth term in office on January 26, 2023.[24] Due to term limits if Nirenberg won, it would be his last term. Nirenberg faced minimal opposition and was expected to win re-election. On May 6, 2023, the election was held and Nirenberg was re-elected with an unofficial count of over 61% of the vote.[4]\n\n\n\n## Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nirenberg as a candidate for mayor, 2015.\n![](image)Nirenberg (second from left) with Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the 2023 United States Conference of Mayors\nAlthough Nirenberg identifies as an independent[25] and ran for office as a nonpartisan politician,[a] he has been described as ideologically progressive.[26][27][28][29]\n\n\nIn 2013, Nirenberg endorsed a city ordinance that bans discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. Taylor, then also a member of the city council, voted against the ordinance. Taylor also opposed the city's filing of a lawsuit against a then-new state law that defines a misdemeanor offense for municipal officials who refuse to cooperate with federal authorities seeking to halt illegal immigration. Signed by Governor Greg Abbott, the law targets the sanctuary city movement. Nirenberg, conversely, backed the lawsuit.[6]\nAs mayor-elect, Nirenberg called upon the city council to endorse the Paris climate accord even though U.S. President Donald Trump had announced plans to remove the United States from the agreement. The San Antonio City Council approved a resolution to sign the Paris climate accord one day after Nirenberg's election, and, in November 2017, the City Council approved the creation of a Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.[30][31][32] This would lead to San Antonio being one of 25 cities awarded the American Cities Climate Challenge grant in 2019 by Michael Bloomberg.[33]\n\n\nIn 2019, Nirenberg supported and defended the move to have a Chick-fil-A restaurant removed from the concessions contract at the San Antonio International Airport, citing a conflict with the company's opposition to LGBTQ rights and that the company's closure on Sunday, done on religious grounds, would hurt revenue.[34][35][36] The move faced controversy and national condemnation from conservatives.[37][38][39][40] Councilman Greg Brockhouse opposed this decision and called for a re-vote on the decision but it was defeated.[41][42] Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton later began an investigation on the actions of Nirenberg and the San Antonio City Council, claiming that the decision was in violation of existing Texas laws, the U.S. Constitution, and even San Antonio's own ethics code.[43] The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also opened an investigation on this action.[44][45] On June 10, 2019, Texas governor Greg Abbott signed into law Senate Bill 1978,[46] colloquially known as the \"Save Chick-fil-A Bill\", which forbids local governments from taking adverse steps against companies or individuals based on their religious beliefs.[47][48]\n\n\nOn March 18, 2020, Nirenberg issued an order for the temporary closure of all non-essential businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, making San Antonio the last major city in Texas to do so.[49][50] In 2021, Nirenberg criticized Texas Governor Greg Abbott's lifting of COVID-19 mandates and prohibition on local governments from being able to make their own, saying the governor was showing \"callous disregard for life.\"[51] The City of San Antonio, led by Nirenberg, and Bexar County sued Abbott in Bexar County court to temporarily block his executive order barring local mandates.[52] A Bexar County judge issued the restraining order on Abbott's executive order, reinstating Nirenberg's mask mandate; a ruling that he applauded.[53] The Supreme Court of Texas would later block Nirenberg's mask mandate.[54]\n\n\nUpon the completion of his fourth term, Nireberg is expected to be among the longest serving mayors of San Antonio,[55] and the longest since Mayor Henry Cisneros, who left office in 1989.[56]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nNirenberg married Erika Prosper in 2001.[57] Erika is the director of customer insights for H-E-B.[58] The couple has one son.[59][60]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the United States\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In Texas, all municipal elections are officially nonpartisan\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Ron Nirenberg\". *Ballotpedia*.

The mayor has the duty to enforce and execute the laws enacted by the San Diego City Council, the legislative branch. The mayor serves a four-year term and is limited to two successive terms.\n\n\nThere have been 36 people who have served as mayor in San Diego since 1850, when California became a state following the American Conquest of California. Prior to the conquest, Californios served as Mayor of San Diego during the Spanish and Mexican eras since 1780. From 1852 to 1888, the city was run by a board of trustees and there was no elected mayor. However, the president of the board was called *mayor* as a courtesy.\n\n\nThe most recent election was held in November 2020. Todd Gloria was elected to be the 37th mayor of San Diego.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe position of mayor was created when San Diego was first incorporated on March 27, 1850. However, the city went bankrupt in 1852, only two years after incorporation. As a result of the bankruptcy, the State of California dissolved the government and replaced the mayor and city council with a board of trustees.[1] The mayoral position was later re-established with a new charter in 1887.[2] This charter was replaced with a permanent City Charter on May 6, 1889, using the strong mayor form of government.\n\n\nIn 1931, a new charter was adopted using a council\u2013manager government with a citywide mayor as leader of the city council.\n\n\nIn November 2004, voters approved Proposition F, returning San Diego to the strong mayor form of government on a five-year trial basis. This was made permanent in June 2010 with the passage of Proposition D.[3]\n\n\n\n### Scandals[edit]\n\n\nThen-mayor Roger Hedgecock was forced to resign his post in 1985, after he was found guilty of one count of conspiracy and 12 counts of perjury, related to the alleged failure to report all campaign contributions.[4][5] After a series of appeals, the 12 perjury counts were dismissed in 1990 based on claims of juror misconduct; the remaining conspiracy count was reduced to a misdemeanor and then dismissed.[6]\n\n\nA 2002 scheme to underfund pensions for city employees led to the San Diego pension scandal. This resulted in the resignation of newly re-elected Mayor Dick Murphy[7] and the criminal indictment of six pension board members.[8] Those charges were dismissed by a federal judge in 2010.[9]\n\n\nIn 2005, two city council members, Ralph Inzunza and Deputy Mayor Michael Zucchet \u2013 who briefly took over as acting mayor when Murphy resigned \u2013 were convicted of extortion, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for taking campaign contributions from a strip club owner and his associates, allegedly in exchange for trying to repeal the city's \"no touch\" laws at strip clubs.[10] Both subsequently resigned. Inzunza was sentenced to 21 months in prison.[11] In 2009, a judge acquitted Zucchet on seven out of the nine counts against him, and granted his petition for a new trial on the other two charges;[12] the remaining charges were eventually dropped.[13]\n\n\nIn July 2013, three former supporters of mayor Bob Filner asked him to resign because of allegations of repeated sexual harassment.[14] Over the ensuing six weeks, 18 women came forward to publicly claim that Filner had sexually harassed them,[15] and multiple individuals and groups called for him to resign. Filner agreed to resign effective August 30, 2013, subsequently pleaded guilty to one felony count of false imprisonment and two misdemeanor battery charges, and was sentenced to house arrest and probation.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Duties and powers[edit]\n\n\nThe mayor serves as the official head of the City of San Diego for all ceremonial and civil purposes. The mayor has the authority to approve or veto council actions, subject to a two-thirds vote veto overrule. Under the strong mayor system, the mayor has sole authority to appoint and dismiss the city manager and to direct and control the city manager as permitted by the city charter. The mayor also has the authority to dismiss the chief of police or the chief of the fire department subject to a council overrule. The mayor may recommend measures and ordinance to the city council, but may not vote on these items.\n\n\nOn or before January 15, the mayor is obligated to communicate a State of the City address to the city council. The mayor must also propose a budget to the city council and for public review no later than April 15.[18]\n\n\nThe salary of the mayor was set at $100,464 in 2003.[19] In March 2012, the city's Salary Setting Commission proposed that the mayor be paid $235,000, but the city council unanimously rejected the recommendation, instead keeping the salary at the 2003 level.[20] In March 2014, the Salary Setting Commission recommended no pay increase for the mayor or city council. Instead, they recommended exploring future pay increases with additional condition that council members voting for pay increases not be allowed to benefit from the increase. This recommendation was approved by the city council in a 5\u20133 vote in favor of the changes.[19] In November 2018, voters passed Measure L which ties future mayoral salaries to those of Superior Court judges.[21] As of December 2020, the mayoral salary is $206,000.[22]\n\n\n\n## Election and succession[edit]\n\n\nThe mayor is elected in citywide election. Elections follow a two-round system. The first round of the election is called the primary election. The top-two candidates from the primary election advance to a runoff election, called the general election. Write-in candidates are only allowed to contest the primary election and are not allowed in the general election. The mayor is elected to a four-year term, with a limit of two consecutive terms.[23] The mayor is officially non-partisan by state law, although most mayoral candidates identify a party preference.\n\n\nIf the office of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less remaining in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected.[24] If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.[18]\n\n\nThe most recent election was held in November 2020. Todd Gloria was elected to be the 37th mayor of San Diego, succeeding the termed out Kevin Faulconer. Gloria had previously served as interim mayor in his role as city council president following the 2013 resignation of Bob Filner.[25]\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\nFor the mayors of San Diego before statehood, see List of pre-statehood mayors of San Diego.\n\nAs of June 2024, 36 individuals have served as mayor. There have been 37 mayoralties because Edwin M. Capps served two non-consecutive terms; he is counted chronologically as both the ninth and sixteenth mayor. The longest term was that of Pete Wilson, who served for eleven years over three terms prior to the establishment of successive term limits. The shortest term, not counting interim or acting mayors, was that of George P. Tebbetts, who served for less than two months before the position of mayor was abolished due to the bankruptcy of the city. Percy J. Benbough is the only mayor to have died in office. Two women have been elected mayor: Maureen O'Connor and Susan Golding consecutively. John F. Forward Sr. and John F. Forward Jr. are the only father and son to have both served as mayor. Todd Gloria is the first mayor of color, with Filipino, Latino, and Native American heritage. Gloria is also the first elected mayor to be openly gay.[25]\n\n\nThis list includes people who served as acting mayor or interim mayor due to a vacancy in the office of the mayor, but who were not officially elected or appointed as mayor. The acting and interim mayors are not included in the count of mayoralties.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Mayor\n | Term in office\n\n---\n\nElections\n | Party[a] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | **Joshua Bean**1818\u20131852(aged 33\u201334) | June 17, 1850\n | January 14, 1851\n | Independent |\n| 1850 |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | **David B.
