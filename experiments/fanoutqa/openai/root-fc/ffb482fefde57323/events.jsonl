Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained.

Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Gray, Brandon. \"'Avatar' Claims Highest Gross of All Time\". *Box Office Mojo*.

The total for *Avatar*'s first appearance on the chart includes revenue from the 2010 Special Edition, which represents all of its earnings up to the point it relinquished the record, whereas its second appearance also incorporates revenue from a 2020 re-release in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the 2021 re-release in China which helped it to reclaim the record. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1972 | *The Godfather* | $246,120,974–287,000,000  ($127,600,000–142,000,000)R | $6,000,000–7,200,000 | [# 237][# 236][# 238][# 239] |\n| 1973 | *The Exorcist* | $441,422,808 ($112,300,000)R | $10,000,000 | [# 240][# 241][# 242][# 243] |\n| *The Sting* | $115,000,000R | $5,500,000 | [# 244][# 245] |\n| 1974 | *The Towering Inferno* | $203,336,412 ($104,838,000)R | $14,300,000 | [# 246][# 247][# 248][# 243][# 249] |\n| 1975 | *Jaws* | $476,512,065 ($193,700,000)R | $9,000,000 | [# 250][# 251][# 252] |\n| 1976 | *Rocky* | $225,000,000 ($77,100,000)R | $1,075,000 | [# 253][# 254][# 236][# 255] |\n| 1977 | *Star Wars* | $775,398,007  ($530,000,000SW/$268,500,000R)\n | $11,293,151 | [# 256][# 257][# 236][# 258] |\n| 1978 | *Grease* | $396,271,103 ($341,000,000)\n | $6,000,000 | [# 259][# 260][# 226] |\n| 1979 | *Moonraker* | $210,308,099 | $31,000,000 | [# 261][# 214][# 262] |\n| *Rocky II* | $200,182,160 | $7,000,000 | [# 263][# 264][# 262] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. ^ ***a*** ***b*** *Guinness World Records*.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Phase Three | $13,505,059,275\n | 11\n | $1,227,732,661\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* (2019) | $2,797,501,328 |\n| 2\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) | $2,048,359,754 |\n| 3\n | *Black Panther* (2018) | $1,347,280,838 |\n| 4\n | *Captain America: Civil War* (2016) | $1,153,337,496 |\n| 5\n | *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019) | $1,131,927,996 |\n| 6\n | *Captain Marvel* (2019) | $1,128,274,794 |\n| 7\n | *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017) | $880,166,924 |\n| 8\n | *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017) | $863,756,051 |\n| 9\n | *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017) | $853,983,879 |\n| 10\n | *Doctor Strange* (2016) | $677,796,076 |\n| 11\n | *Ant-Man and the Wasp* (2018) | $622,674,139\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n111. **^** \"How 'Spectre' May Stack Up With 'Thunderball' as a James Bond Blockbuster\". *The New York Times*.

The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Phase Two | $5,269,487,547\n | 6\n | $878,247,925\n | *Avengers: Age of Ultron* ($1,402,809,540)\n |\n| 1\n | *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015) | $1,402,809,540 |\n| 2\n | *Iron Man 3* (2013) | $1,214,811,252 |\n| 3\n | *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014) | $773,350,147 |\n| 4\n | *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014) | $714,421,503 |\n| 5\n | *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) | $644,783,140 |\n| 6\n | *Ant-Man* (2015) | $519,311,965\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Phase One | $3,813,212,481\n | 6\n | $635,535,414\n | *The Avengers* ($1,518,815,515)\n |\n| 1\n | *The Avengers* (2012) | $1,518,815,515 |\n| 2\n | *Iron Man 2* (2010) | $623,933,331 |\n| 3\n | *Iron Man* (2008) | $585,796,247 |\n| 4\n | *Thor* (2011) | $449,326,618 |\n| 5\n | *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011) | $370,569,774 |\n| 6\n | *The Incredible Hulk* (2008) | $264,770,996\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Spider-Verse | $1,066,057,504\n | 2\n | $533,028,752\n | *Across the Spider-Verse* ($690,516,673)\n |\n| 1\n | *Across the Spider-Verse* (2023) | $690,516,673 |\n| 2\n | *Into the Spider-Verse* (2018) | $375,540,831\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 3\n | *Star Wars* | $10,324,504,714\n | 12\n | $860,375,393\n | *The Force Awakens* ($2,068,223,624)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Skywalker Saga | $8,805,876,676\n | 9\n | $978,430,742\n | *The Force Awakens* ($2,068,223,624)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Sequel trilogy | $4,474,907,761\n | 3\n | $1,491,635,920\n | *The Force Awakens* ($2,068,223,624)\n |\n| 1\n | *VII – The Force Awakens* (2015) | $2,068,223,624 |\n| 2\n | *VIII – The Last Jedi* (2017) | $1,332,539,889 |\n| 3\n | *IX – The Rise of Skywalker* (2019) | $1,074,144,248\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"The Empire Strikes Back\". *Box Office Mojo*.

If it were the rental gross then that would have made it not only the highest-grossing film of the year, but one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era, and if that is the case it would be unusual for both *International Motion Picture Almanac* and *Variety* to omit it from their lists.\n\n\nSSIt is not clear if the figure for *Sunny Side Up* is for North America or worldwide.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50 million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5 million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120 million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n193. **^** Finler 2003, p. 320. \"It was up and running in time to handle Disney's most elaborate expensive feature, *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea*, based on the book by Jules Verne, starring James Mason and Kirk Douglas and directed by Richard Fleischer at a cost of $4.5 million.\"\n194. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** D'Alessandro, Anthony (October 27, 2003). \"Disney Animated Features at the Worldwide Box Office\". *Variety*.

When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Avatar (2009)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Gray, Brandon. \"'Avatar' Claims Highest Gross of All Time\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat figure seems far more feasible, as reports of earnings in the Griffith collection list gross receipts for 1915–1919 at slightly more than $5.2 million (including foreign distribution) and total earnings after deducting general office expenses, but not royalties, at about $2 million.\n66. **^** \"Biggest Money Pictures\". *Variety*.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Phase Three | $13,505,059,275\n | 11\n | $1,227,732,661\n | *Avengers: Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* (2019) | $2,797,501,328 |\n| 2\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) | $2,048,359,754 |\n| 3\n | *Black Panther* (2018) | $1,347,280,838 |\n| 4\n | *Captain America: Civil War* (2016) | $1,153,337,496 |\n| 5\n | *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019) | $1,131,927,996 |\n| 6\n | *Captain Marvel* (2019) | $1,128,274,794 |\n| 7\n | *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017) | $880,166,924 |\n| 8\n | *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017) | $863,756,051 |\n| 9\n | *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017) | $853,983,879 |\n| 10\n | *Doctor Strange* (2016) | $677,796,076 |\n| 11\n | *Ant-Man and the Wasp* (2018) | $622,674,139\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n111. **^** \"How 'Spectre' May Stack Up With 'Thunderball' as a James Bond Blockbuster\". *The New York Times*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Phase Two | $5,269,487,547\n | 6\n | $878,247,925\n | *Avengers: Age of Ultron* ($1,402,809,540)\n |\n| 1\n | *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015) | $1,402,809,540 |\n| 2\n | *Iron Man 3* (2013) | $1,214,811,252 |\n| 3\n | *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014) | $773,350,147 |\n| 4\n | *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014) | $714,421,503 |\n| 5\n | *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) | $644,783,140 |\n| 6\n | *Ant-Man* (2015) | $519,311,965\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Phase One | $3,813,212,481\n | 6\n | $635,535,414\n | *The Avengers* ($1,518,815,515)\n |\n| 1\n | *The Avengers* (2012) | $1,518,815,515 |\n| 2\n | *Iron Man 2* (2010) | $623,933,331 |\n| 3\n | *Iron Man* (2008) | $585,796,247 |\n| 4\n | *Thor* (2011) | $449,326,618 |\n| 5\n | *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011) | $370,569,774 |\n| 6\n | *The Incredible Hulk* (2008) | $264,770,996\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Spider-Verse | $1,066,057,504\n | 2\n | $533,028,752\n | *Across the Spider-Verse* ($690,516,673)\n |\n| 1\n | *Across the Spider-Verse* (2023) | $690,516,673 |\n| 2\n | *Into the Spider-Verse* (2018) | $375,540,831\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 3\n | *Star Wars* | $10,324,504,714\n | 12\n | $860,375,393\n | *The Force Awakens* ($2,068,223,624)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Skywalker Saga | $8,805,876,676\n | 9\n | $978,430,742\n | *The Force Awakens* ($2,068,223,624)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Sequel trilogy | $4,474,907,761\n | 3\n | $1,491,635,920\n | *The Force Awakens* ($2,068,223,624)\n |\n| 1\n | *VII – The Force Awakens* (2015) | $2,068,223,624 |\n| 2\n | *VIII – The Last Jedi* (2017) | $1,332,539,889 |\n| 3\n | *IX – The Rise of Skywalker* (2019) | $1,074,144,248\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"The Empire Strikes Back\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50 million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5 million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120 million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n193. **^** Finler 2003, p. 320. \"It was up and running in time to handle Disney's most elaborate expensive feature, *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea*, based on the book by Jules Verne, starring James Mason and Kirk Douglas and directed by Richard Fleischer at a cost of $4.5 million.\"\n194. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** D'Alessandro, Anthony (October 27, 2003). \"Disney Animated Features at the Worldwide Box Office\". *Variety*.
