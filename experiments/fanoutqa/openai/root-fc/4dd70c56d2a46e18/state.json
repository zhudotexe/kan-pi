His father then taught him to play the clarinet and then the violin at age eight. Early studies were at the Samuel Rubin Academy of Music (now the Buchmann-Mehta School of Music). Isaac Stern and Pablo Casals learned of Zukerman's violin talent during a 1962 visit to Israel. Zukerman subsequently moved to the United States that year to study at the Juilliard School[3] under Stern and Ivan Galamian. He made his New York City debut in 1963. In 1967, he shared the Leventritt Prize with the Korean violinist Kyung-wha Chung. His 1969 debut recordings of the concerti by Tchaikovsky (under the direction of Antal Dorati, with the London Symphony Orchestra) and Mendelssohn (with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic) launched a successful recording career of over 110 releases.\n\n\nZukerman launched his conducting career in 1970 with the English Chamber Orchestra, and served as director of London's South Bank Festival from 1971 to 1974. In the US, Zukerman was music director of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra from 1980 to 1987. He later directed the summer festivals of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra (1991\u201395) and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (1996\u201399). In 1999, he became Music Director of Canada's National Arts Centre Orchestra (NACO) in Ottawa,[4][5] stepping down from the post in 2015. He has served as Principal Guest Conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra since 2009.\n\n\nZukerman is on the faculty at the Manhattan School of Music and is the head and founder of the Zukerman Performance Program at the school. His former students include Koh Gabriel Kameda, Julian Rachlin, and Guy Braunstein. In 1999 he founded the National Arts Centre Young Artists Programme, which counts young musicians such as Viviane Hagner, Jessica Linnebach, and Antal Szalai as alumni. In 2006 Zukerman began his involvement in the Rolex Artistic Mentorship programme.\n\n\nZukerman plays the \"Dushkin\" Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 violin of 1742. His honors include the King Solomon Award, the National Medal of Arts (presented by President Reagan in 1983), the Isaac Stern Award for Artistic Excellence, and an honorary doctorate from Brown University.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nZukerman married Eugenia Rich in 1968.[6] The couple had two daughters together, opera singer Arianna Zukerman and blues/folk musician Natalia Zukerman.[7][8][9] They frequently appeared together in concert until their separation in 1983. Zukerman was then married to actress Tuesday Weld from 1985 to 2001.[10] He and Weld owned homes in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Montauk, New York, which they bought after the murder-suicide of its previous owners, soap opera actress Gwyda Donhowe and Broadway producer Norman Kean.[11][12] Zukerman and his third wife, cellist Amanda Forsyth, have been married since 2004 and primarily reside in Manhattan. They often appear as soloists together.\n\n\n\n## Recordings[edit]\n\n\nHis recordings have received 21 Grammy nominations, and two Grammy wins.[13] He has collaborated with filmmaker Christopher Nupen on several projects, and was the subject of Nupen's \"Pinchas Zukerman: Here to Make Music\" documentary of 1974. In 2003 he founded a string quintet, the Zukerman Chamber Players, which has released three CD recordings in addition to its roster of live performances.\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n* 2015: Brahms: Double concerto \u2013 Symphony No. 4 (Analekta), AN2 8782\n* 2016: Baroque Treasury (Analekta), AN2 8783\n* 2016: Vaughan Williams & Elgar \u2013 Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (Decca)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Britannica biography\n2. **^** Interview on Youtube\n3. **^** Slonimsky, Nicolas (1978). \"Zukerman, Pinchas\". *Baker's Biographical dictionary of musicians* (6th\u00a0ed.).

Bach, and her innovative interpretations of popular and jazz compositions by Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, The Beatles, and others.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography and early career[edit]\n\n\nMullova was born in Zhukovsky, 45\u00a0km from Moscow, in Soviet Russia.[3] At the age of four, she was encouraged to start her violin training by her father Yuri Mullov, the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute physicist and engineer.[1] After studying at the Central Music School of Moscow\u00a0[de] and at the Moscow Conservatory under Leonid Kogan, she won first prize at the 1980 International Jean Sibelius Violin Competition in Helsinki and the gold medal at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1982. She remembered the whole experience of the Soviet quasi-religious state-sponsored musical education as an overly stressful nightmare full of hypocrisy: \"Naturally, I have never believed in communism. But everything was a play. I knew I wanted to leave, and I was pretending to be a naive girl\".[4][a]\n\n\n\n## Defection[edit]\n\n\nDuring a tour of Finland in 1983, Mullova and her lover, Vakhtang Jordania, who posed as her accompanist so they could defect together, left the hotel in Kuusamo, after Jordania told the KGB officer who was watching them that Mullova was too sick from drinking to attend the afterparty. The Stradivari violin owned by the Soviet Union was left behind on the hotel bed. YLE journalist Jyrki Koulumies,[20][21] accompanied by photographer Caj Sundman, drove them in a rented car across the border via Haparanda to Lule\u00e5, Sweden where they flew to Stockholm.\n\n\nAt that time, the Swedish police treated the young, on-the-run musicians just like any other political defectors from the Eastern Bloc: they suggested that the couple stay in a safehouse over the weekend until the American Embassy opened so they could apply for political asylum upon relocation. So for two days they sat under pseudonyms in a safehouse not even daring to go outside, because their photographs were on the front page of every Swedish and international newspaper. Two days later they arrived in Washington, D.C., with American visas in their pockets.\n\n\n\n## Life in the West[edit]\n\n\nMullova has made many recordings including her debut release of the Tchaikovsky and Jean Sibelius violin concertos which was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque.\n\n\nShe formed the Mullova Chamber Ensemble in the mid-1990s. The ensemble has toured Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands and has recorded the Bach violin concertos on Philips Classics. She was nominated for a 1995 Grammy Award for her recording of the Bach Partitas, and she won a 1995 Echo Klassik award, a Japanese Record Academy Award and a Deutsche Schallplattenkritik prize for her recording of the Brahms violin concerto. Her recording of the Brahms B major Trio (no. 1) and Beethoven's Archduke Trio with Andr\u00e9 Previn and Heinrich Schiff was released in 1995, receiving a further Diapason d'Or.\n\n\nMullova's international career as a soloist has included performances with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Philharmonia, the Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna Symphony, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the San Francisco Symphony and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. She has also performed as soloist and director with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.\n\n\nMullova plays the Jules Falk Stradivarius from 1723 and a violin made in 1750 by Giovanni Battista Guadagnini. Her bows include a Baroque style bow by a Walter Barbiero,[22] one of the finest makers of modern bows, a Dodd and a Voirin.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMullova currently lives in Holland Park, London, England, with her husband, cellist Matthew Barley, and three children: the jazz bassist Misha Mullov-Abbado, from her relationship with conductor and pianist Claudio Abbado;[23] Katia, from her relationship with violinist Alan Brind; and Nadia, who is a dancer in the Royal Ballet,[24] from her marriage to Barley.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## Selected discography[edit]\n\n\n* *Beethoven Violin Sonatas Nos. 3, 9* (Onyx 4050).

Classical music performers were household names rivaled to movie stars and popular singers through its constant presence on a Soviet TV, just like the ballet dancers[6] and Kabalevsky's then-famous credo quote \"Beauty Evokes Kindness\" (Russian: \u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0435, romanized:\u00a0*Prekrasnoe probuzhdaet dobroe*)[7] Vladimir Lenin's self-proclaimed atheism, as a lack of transcendental ideals that are important to the others, was perceived as wishful thinking because of Maxim Gorky's 1924 testimony about the leader's admiration for Issay Dobrowen's performance of the \"preterhuman music\" of one of Beethoven's 32 sonatas, all of them being the \"New Testament\" of Moscow Conservatory piano department (with *The Well-Tempered Clavier* as \"Old Testament\"; all-Soviet famous Hans von B\u00fclow statement[8]).[9]\n  \n  \n\nThe oppressive musical education system, as mentioned by Mullova, included thousands of state-sponsored regional non-special complementary children musical schools raising the professional classical music consumers mostly, after a full 8-year-course, and not only the professional musicians. The stable existence of multiple pre-professionally trained listeners has created additional pressure for the performers, sometimes have returned to classical music \"from the front door\" many years and even decades after the graduation from the musical school.[10][11] As an example of attitude, Ludwig van Beethoven's classical song *Marmotte\u00a0[ru]* has become a point of Soviet children's early, elementary school or kindergarten age introduction to the \"unfading ethical ideal\".[12] The Soviet ideology was based on \"another myth about Beethoven: a democrat, sansculotte, a man of the revolutionary era, a rebel, a revolutionary\".[13] Beethoven was ubiquitously wrongly referenced by kids with the false patronymic \"Ludwig Ivanovich\", from 'van', although his father's name was also a variation of \"Ivan\", and it has become a popular in-joke.[14]\n  \n  \n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the system was financially \"abandoned by the state to face the merciless fate\" and, as a repentance for his collaboration with the Soviet authorities and a certain level of animosity, a lack of solidarity, towards his fellow composers Prokofiev and Shostakovich, Kabalevsky has been excluded from a shortlist of worthy Soviet-era composers.[7] By 2019, the number of classical music fans was reduced to a fourth-place overall, 22 percent, behind the Russian/Soviet pop and \"criminals' songs\" (30 percent). It was still more than a number of people who attend religious services at least once a month, as of 2008.[15][16] However, according to the Greek conductor Teodor Currentzis, the ongoing cultural genocide of instrumentalists and their admirers by the Russian officials is far from complete, yet close: \"Russia has the best audience, the most educated\".[17][18][19]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The goddess of victory lives in London\" (in Russian).

He studied music and learned to play the violin with his father and at the Chicago Cosmopolitan Conservatory of Music. At the age of 12, he debuted with the Chicago Symphony orchestra playing the Mendelssohn concerto. He went to the Prague Conservatory in Czechoslovakia to further his violin studies.[3]\n\n\nWhen he returned to the United States, he joined the music staff of Chicago's NBC and WGN radio stations. After 2+1\u20442 years in the Army Medical Corps as a private and a corporal, he resumed his musical career in Washington, D.C. at the Mayflower Hotel. Television's Arthur Godfrey discovered him there, and ZaBach appeared on Godfrey's show several times. He also appeared on most of the television shows emanating from New York at the time: Ed Sullivan, Milton Berle, Ken Murray, Red Skelton, Steve Allen, Jack Paar and 25 appearances on The Tonight Show. For over a year he performed five one-hour shows daily, seven days a week as master of ceremonies, orchestra conductor and violin soloist on the stage of Strand Theatre on Broadway.[3]\n\n\nZaBach then moved to Hollywood, where he filmed the \"Florian ZaBach\" show, a weekly half-hour television series that was syndicated nationwide in more than 90 markets and in major cities throughout the world. He also appeared with major symphony orchestras as soloist and conductor on their pops concerts in the United States and in London, Vienna, Genoa, Venice, Australia[6] and Beijing, among other concert halls.[3]\n\n\nZaBach recorded many albums for Mercury and Decca using his 1732 Guarnerius del Gesu violin, created in Cremona, Italy.[3] including million-seller \"The Hot Canary\" on Decca in 1951 and a minor hit \"When The White Lilacs Bloom Again' on Mercury in 1956.[7]\n\n\nZaBach spent the later years of his life living and working in Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania. His compositions and musical arrangements were donated to the Florian ZaBach Papers in the Library of Congress in August 2005. He died at Scranton, Pennsylvania on February 25, 2006.[8]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nA partial listing of his recordings follows.\n\n\n\n### Vinyl LPs[edit]\n\n\n* *Golden Strings*[9]\n* *Hi-Fi Fiddle*[10]\n* *The Hot Canary*  (1951)[11][9][10]\n* *Hour of Love*[9]\n* *String Along With ZaBach*\n* *Till the End of Time* (m) (1958)[9][10]\n* *It's Easy to Dance With Florian ZaBach* (m) (1959)[9]\n* *Do It Yourself Wedding Album* (June Valli & Florian ZaBach) (1959)[9]\n* *With the Nashville Country Strings*[9]\n* *Till the End of Time* (s) (1959)[9][10]\n* *It's Easy to Dance With Florian ZaBach* (s) (1960)[9]\n\n### Vinyl 45s[edit]\n\n\n* \"April in Portugal\"[9][10]\n* \"Dream of Romance\"[10]\n* \"Fiddler's Boogie\"[9][10]\n* \"Jalousie\"[10]\n* \"Oceans of Love\"[10]\n* \"Petticoats of Portugal\"[10]\n* \"Pussy Footin'\"[10]\n* \"Runaway Romance\"[10]\n* \"Rainbow Trail\"[10]\n* \"Red Canary\"[9][10]\n* \"Red Wing\"[10]\n* \"Running off the Rails\"[10]\n* \"Tea for Two\"[10]\n* \"Waltzing Cat\"[10]\n* \"When the White Lilacs Bloom Again\" (1956)[2][9][10]\n* \"Whistler and His Dog\"[10]\n\n### Vinyl 78s[edit]\n\n\n* *Red Canary*/*April in Portugal*[12]\n* *Fiddler's Boogie*[10]\n\n## References and notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Birth year is per Social Security Death Index Interactive Search at [1].

Her great-great-grandfather was the noted Bohemian composer Johann Baptist Georg Neruda (1708\u20131780), and her father, Josef Neruda (1807\u20131875),[*citation needed*] was the organist of the cathedral of Brno. Her father taught her piano, yet she desired to play the violin. At the time, the violin was considered better suited for men, and therefore it was uncommon for women to study the violin. Apparently, Josef caught his daughter playing on her older brother's violin in secret and was so surprised at her natural ability that he allowed her to study violin instead. \n\n\nNeruda, like many other influential musicians of the 19th century, was a child prodigy. Several of her siblings, including Maria Neruda and Franz Xaver Neruda, were also child prodigies in their own right, and pursued professional musical careers in adulthood. During her career as a child prodigy, Neruda's birth year was reported in different years, between 1838 and 1840. Lying about the age of a child musician wasn't uncommon; the appearance of being younger made their talents seem more impressive.\n\n\nThe family moved to Vienna, where she studied with Leopold Jansa (1795\u20131875), a professor at the University of Vienna. Jansa apparently overheard Wilma playing the violin while visiting the Neruda household and insisted she study violin with him, despite her age and gender. She made her first public appearance as a solo violinist in Vienna at the age of seven, playing a violin sonata by Johann Sebastian Bach. The talented Neruda children began touring Europe performing programs of chamber music. These concerts were received with considerable enthusiasm, and audiences especially favored Wilma's technical facilities and musical maturity. Around the age of 11, Neruda made her solo debut with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, performing a violin concerto by Charles August de B\u00e9riot.\n\n\nNeruda married Swedish musician Ludvig Norman (1831\u20131885) in Stockholm in 1864 and had two sons, Franz Ludvig and Felix Wilhelm Waldemar. Their marriage would unfortunately prove to be an unhappy one. However, as a devout Catholic, Neruda did not believe in divorce. As their relationship further deteriorated, Neruda moved to London. The remainder of their marriage would be spent apart, until Ludvig Norman's death in 1885.\n\n\nNeruda married the German-English pianist and conductor Charles Hall\u00e9 (1819\u20131895) in 1888. The two had met and performed together years prior on various chamber music tours, and stayed in regular correspondence. When he was knighted later in 1888, Wilma Neruda adopted the title Lady Hall\u00e9. Neruda's second marriage would be happy, but unfortunately short. Charles and Lady Hall\u00e9 toured as a piano and violin duo with great success, in Europe, South Africa and Australia.\n\n\nThroughout her life, Wilma Neruda was an avid chamber musician. Following some encouragement from Henri Vieuxtemps, she joined a Monday Popular Concert series in London with a string quartet, where she led from the first violin position except for when her lifelong friend Joseph Joachim was visiting and took this position.\n\n\nTragedy would strike Neruda's life at the end of the 19th century. In 1895, shortly after returning to London following a tour in South Africa with Lady Hall\u00e9, Charles Hall\u00e9 died suddenly. He was internationally acclaimed, and his death was considered a great loss, especially to the British public. The British government gifted Lady Hall\u00e9 a Palazzo in Asolo, Italy, where she moved to live with her son, Ludvig, who was an alpinist. Yet again, a sudden and tragic death would affect Neruda: Ludvig died in a tragic accident in 1898 while climbing in the Dolomites. Despite the loss of her second husband and son, she embarked on a tour in the United States and Canada the year following Ludvig's death in 1899 and reportedly wore black during her performances there, as a tribute to her late son.\n\n\nAt the age of sixty, she decided to retire from concertizing and subsequently moved to Berlin to begin a teaching career. In an interview, she revealed she had only studied with one master, Leopold Jansa, and discouraged anyone from seeking study with multiple teachers: \"I thoroughly disapprove of the system of changing schools so prevalent just now. One master should only train and develop the flexible, impressionable growth of interpretation, so that the young shoots in the form of impressions may not wander adrift in the ocean of infinity.\"[2]\n\n\nNeruda spent the last years of her life traveling between London and Berlin. Queen Alexandra appointed her *Violinist to the Queen* in 1901.[3] She died in 1911 in Berlin, aged 72.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Henri Vieuxtemps, Pablo de Sarasate, James Scott Skinner, and Niels Gade dedicated compositions to her, among other composers.\n\n\nNeruda was a first-rate soloist, and her performances were met with considerable critical acclaim. While touring as a soloist in Russia, the 14-year-old Neruda performed at the same concert as a 17-year-old Henryk Wieniawski in Moscow. Neruda was given a bouquet from Henri Vieuxtemps, and the audience gave her an enthusiastic ovation. Wieniawski became jealous and attempted to come back onstage to prove he was the superior violinist, but was restrained by some individuals, including a Russian general. Wieniawski prodded the general with his bow to move out of his way, a serious affront that led to Wieniawski's immediate dismissal from Moscow. Such a disrespectful act to a high-ranking military individual could have brought a far worse punishment. Nevertheless, Neruda regularly performed works by Wieniawski throughout her career.\n\n\nWhile Neruda owned multiple violins, she performed most regularly on a Stradivarius violin from 1709. \"Lady Hall\u00e9\" Stradivarius (as it is known today) was previously owned by Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst, before falling into her hands.\n\n\nJoseph Joachim was a great admirer of Neruda's violin playing; in 1870 he wrote to his wife \"I like her very much...Her playing is more to my taste than that of any other contemporary \u2013 unspoilt, pure and musical.\"[4] He also said regarding Neruda's playing: \"People will think more of her, and less of me.\" Joachim and Neruda performed Bach's Double Violin Concerto together at a St James' Hall Monday Popular Concert in April 1892. Both Joachim and Neruda were life-long friends, and held much respect for one another. Neruda performed at Joachim's memorial service following his death in 1907.\n\n\nIn *A Study in Scarlet* by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes (himself a violinist) attends a solo performance given by Neruda, where afterwards he raves about her bow control.[5] Some sources suggest that Conan Doyle's novel was the inspiration for the pen name adopted by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, instead of it being inspired by Czech writer Jan Neruda.[6]\n\n\n\n## Name changes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

As was common practice, most of her name changes were reflections of her marriages. She retained Norman-Neruda even after the death of her first husband, Ludvig Norman.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** *New York Times* report (17 April 1910) of Wilma Neruda's 71st birthday (birthday given as 29 March 1839).
