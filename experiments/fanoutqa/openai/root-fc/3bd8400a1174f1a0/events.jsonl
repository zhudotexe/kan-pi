Barrett was a U.S. circuit judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit from 2017 to 2020.\n\n\nBarrett graduated from Rhodes College before attending Notre Dame Law School, earning a J.D. with distinction in 1997. She then clerked for Judge Laurence Silberman and Justice Antonin Scalia. In 2002, Barrett joined the faculty at Notre Dame Law School, becoming a professor in 2010. While serving on the federal bench, she has continued to teach civil procedure, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nOn September 26, 2020, Trump nominated Barrett to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court of the United States.[6][7][8] Her nomination was controversial because the 2020 presidential election was only 38 days away and Senate Republicans had refused to hold hearings for Merrick Garland during an election year in 2016.[9] The next month, the U.S. Senate voted 52–48 to confirm her nomination, with all Democrats and one Republican in opposition.[10]\n\n\nDescribed as a protégée of Justice Antonin Scalia,[11][12][13] Barrett supports textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in constitutional interpretation.[14][15][16] She is generally considered to be among the Court's conservative bloc.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAmy Vivian Coney was born in 1972 in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Linda (*née* Vath) and Michael Coney.[17][18] The eldest of seven children, she has five sisters and a brother. Her father worked as an attorney for Shell Oil Company, and her mother was a high school French teacher and homemaker. Barrett has Irish and French ancestry.[19][20] Her maternal ancestors were from Ballyconnell, County Cavan, Ireland, while there is also Irish lineage among her father's ancestors. Her great-great-grandparents emigrated from France to New Orleans.[21] Her family is devoutly Catholic, and her father is an ordained deacon at St. Catherine of Siena Parish in Metairie, Louisiana, where she grew up.[22][23]\n\n\nBarrett attended St. Mary's Dominican High School, an all-girls Roman Catholic high school in New Orleans.[24] She was student body vice president of the school and graduated in 1990.[25] After high school, Barrett attended Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, where she majored in English literature and minored in French. She considers herself \"somewhat fluent\" in French, but with a Louisiana accent.[26] Barrett graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts, *magna cum laude*, and was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa and Phi Beta Kappa.[27] In her graduating class, she was named most outstanding English department graduate.[28]\n\n\nBarrett then attended Notre Dame Law School on a full-tuition scholarship. She was an executive editor of the *Notre Dame Law Review* and graduated in 1997 ranked first in her class with a Juris Doctor, *summa cum laude*.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Legal career[edit]\n\n\n### Clerkships and private practice[edit]\n\n\nBarrett spent two years as a judicial law clerk after law school, first for Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1997 to 1998, and then for Justice Antonin Scalia of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1998 to 1999.[30]\n\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Barrett practiced law at Miller Cassidy Larroca & Lewin, a boutique law firm for litigation in Washington, D.C., that merged with the Houston, Texas-based law firm Baker Botts in 2001.[29][31] While at Baker Botts, she worked on *Bush v. Gore*, the lawsuit that grew out of the 2000 United States presidential election, providing research and briefing assistance for the firm's representation of George W. Bush.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and scholarship[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, Barrett was a visiting associate professor and John M. Olin Fellow in Law at George Washington University Law School. In 2002, she joined the faculty of her alma mater, Notre Dame Law School.[34] At Notre Dame, she taught federal courts, evidence, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation. In 2007, she was a visiting professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.[35] Barrett was named a professor of law at Notre Dame in 2010, and from 2014 to 2017 held Notre Dame's Diane and M.O. Miller II Research Chair of Law.[36] Her scholarship focused on constitutional law, originalism, statutory interpretation, and *stare decisis*.[28] Her academic work has been published in the *Columbia*, *Cornell*, *Virginia*, *Notre Dame*, and *Texas* law reviews.[34]\n\n\nAt Notre Dame, Barrett received the \"Distinguished Professor of the Year\" award three times.[34] From 2011 to 2016, she spoke on constitutional law at Blackstone Legal Fellowship, a summer program for law school students that the Alliance Defending Freedom established to inspire a \"distinctly Christian worldview in every area of law\".[37] While serving on the Seventh Circuit, Barrett commuted between Chicago and South Bend, continuing to teach courses on statutory interpretation and constitutional theory.[38][39]\n\n\nIn 2010, Chief Justice John Roberts appointed Barrett to serve on the Advisory Committee for the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.[34]\n\n\n\n## Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (2017–2020)[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nFile:Prof Amy Coney Barrett 2 10.jpgBarrett before the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 6, 2017\nOn May 8, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit—the federal appellate court covering Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin—after Judge John Daniel Tinder took senior status.[5][40] A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on her nomination was held on September 6, 2017.[41] During the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein questioned Barrett about a law review article Barrett co-wrote in 1998 with Professor John H. Garvey in which they argued that Catholic judges should in some cases recuse themselves from death penalty cases due to their moral objections to the death penalty.[42] Asked to \"elaborate on the statements and discuss how you view the issue of faith versus fulfilling the responsibility as a judge today,\" Barrett said that she had participated in many death-penalty appeals while serving as law clerk to Scalia, adding, \"My personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear on the discharge of my duties as a judge\"[43][44] and \"It is never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge's personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law.\"[45] Barrett emphasized that the article was written in her third year in law school and that she was \"very much the junior partner in our collaboration.\"[46] Worried that Barrett would not uphold *Roe v. Wade* given her Catholic beliefs, Feinstein followed Barrett's response by saying, \"the dogma lives loudly within you, and that is a concern.\"[47][48][49]\n\n\nThe hearing made Barrett popular with religious conservatives.[29] Feinstein's and other senators' questioning was criticized by some Republicans and other observers, such as university presidents John I. Jenkins of the University of Notre Dame and Christopher Eisgruber of Princeton, as an improper inquiry into a nominee's religious belief that employed an unconstitutional \"religious test\" for office;[45][50] others, such as Nan Aron, defended Feinstein's line of questioning.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Judge Laurence Silberman, for whom Barrett first clerked after law school, swearing her in at her investiture for the Seventh Circuit in 2018\nLambda Legal, an LGBT civil rights organization, co-signed a letter with 26 other gay rights organizations opposing Barrett's nomination. The letter expressed doubts about her ability to separate faith from her rulings on LGBT matters.[52][53] During her Senate hearing, Barrett was questioned about landmark LGBTQ legal precedents such as *Obergefell v. Hodges*, *United States v. Windsor*, and *Lawrence v. Texas*. She said these cases are \"binding precedents\" that she intended to \"faithfully follow if confirmed\" to the appeals court, as required by law.[52] The letter Lambda Legal co-signed read, \"Simply repeating that she would be bound by Supreme Court precedent does not illuminate—indeed, it obfuscates—how Professor Barrett would interpret and apply precedent when faced with the sorts of dilemmas that, in her view, 'put Catholic judges in a bind.'\"[52]\n\n\nBarrett's nomination was supported by every law clerk she had worked with and all of her 49 faculty colleagues at Notre Dame Law school. 450 former students signed a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee supporting her nomination.[54][55]\n\n\nOn October 5, 2017, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11–9 on party lines to recommend Barrett and report her nomination to the full Senate.[56][57] On October 30, the Senate invoked cloture by a vote of 54–42.[58] It confirmed her by a vote of 55–43 on October 31, with three Democrats—Joe Donnelly, Tim Kaine, and Joe Manchin—voting for her.[27] She received her commission two days later.[2] Barrett is the first and only woman to occupy an Indiana seat on the Seventh Circuit.[59]\n\n\n\n### Selected cases[edit]\n\n\nOral arguments from *Cook County, Illinois v. Chad F. Wolf*, one of the last cases that Barrett took in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020\nOn the Seventh Circuit, Barrett wrote 79 majority opinions (including two that were amended and one that was withdrawn on rehearing), four concurring opinions (one a per curiam opinion), and six dissenting opinions (six published and one in an unpublished order).[35]\n\n\n\n#### Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, the court, in a unanimous decision written by Barrett, reinstated a suit brought by a male Purdue University student (John Doe) who had been found guilty of sexual assault by Purdue University, which resulted in a one-year suspension, loss of his Navy ROTC scholarship, and expulsion from the ROTC affecting his ability to pursue his chosen career in the Navy.[60][61] Doe alleged the school's Advisory Committee on Equity discriminated against him on the basis of his sex and violated his rights to due process by not interviewing the alleged victim, not allowing him to present evidence in his defense, including an erroneous statement that he confessed to some of the alleged assault, and appearing to believe the victim instead of the accused without hearing from either party or having even read the investigation report. The court found that Doe had adequately alleged that the university deprived him of his occupational liberty without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and had violated his Title IX rights \"by imposing a punishment infected by sex bias\", and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.[62][63]\n\n\n\n#### Employment discrimination[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, the Seventh Circuit rejected the federal government's appeal in a civil lawsuit against AutoZone; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission argued that AutoZone's assignment of employees to different stores based on race (e.g., \"sending African American employees to stores in heavily African American neighborhoods\") violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Following this, Barrett joined the court as it received a petition for rehearing *en banc*. Three judges—Chief Judge Diane Wood and judges Ilana Rovner and David Hamilton—voted to grant rehearing, and criticized the three-judge panel's opinion as upholding a \"separate-but-equal arrangement\". Barrett did not join the panel opinion, but voted with four judges to deny the petition to rehear the case. The petition was unsuccessful by a 5–3 decision.[64][29]\n\n\nIn 2019, Barrett wrote the unanimous three-judge panel opinion affirming summary judgment in the case of *Smith v. Illinois Department of Transportation*. Smith was a Black employee who claimed racial discrimination upon his dismissal by the department and that he was called a \"stupid-ass nigger\" by a Black supervisor; the department claimed Smith failed work-level expectations during probationary periods. Barrett wrote that usage of the racial slur was egregious, but Smith's testimony showed no evidence that his subjective experience of the workplace changed because of the slur, nor did it change the department's fact that his discharge was related to \"poor performance\".[65][66]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Barrett wrote a 40-page dissent when the majority upheld a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration's controversial \"public charge rule\", which heightened the standard for obtaining a green card.[67] In her dissent, she argued that any noncitizens who disenrolled from government benefits because of the rule did so due to confusion about the rule itself rather than from its application, writing that the vast majority of the people subject to the rule are not eligible for government benefits in the first place. On the merits, Barrett departed from her colleagues Wood and Rovner, who held that DHS's interpretation of that provision was unreasonable under *Chevron* Step Two. Barrett would have held that the new rule fell within the broad scope of discretion granted to the Executive by Congress through the Immigration and Nationality Act.[68] The public charge issue is the subject of a circuit split.[68][69]\n\n\nIn May 2019, the court rejected a Yemeni citizen and her U.S. citizen husband's challenge to a consular officer's decision to twice deny her visa application under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The U.S. citizen argued that this had deprived him of a constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse.[70] In a 2–1 majority opinion authored by Barrett, the court held that the plaintiff's claim was properly dismissed under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. Barrett declined to address whether the husband had been denied a constitutional right (or whether the constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse existed at all) because the consular officer's decision to deny the visa application was facially legitimate and bona fide, and under Supreme Court precedent, in such a case courts will not \"look behind the exercise of that discretion\". The dispute concerned what it takes to satisfy this standard. A petition for rehearing *en banc* was denied, with Chief Judge Wood, joined by Rovner and Hamilton, dissenting. Barrett wrote a rare opinion concurring in the denial of rehearing *en banc* (joined by Judge Joel Flaum).[70][71]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion-related cases[edit]\n\n\nBarrett had never ruled directly on abortion before joining the Supreme Court, but she did vote to rehear a successful challenge to Indiana's parental notification law in 2019. In 2018, she voted against striking down another Indiana law requiring burial or cremation of fetal remains. In both cases, Barrett voted with the minority. The Supreme Court later reinstated the fetal remains law, and in July 2020 it ordered a rehearing in the parental notification case.[72][73]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision upholding a Chicago \"bubble ordinance\" that prohibits approaching within a certain distance of an abortion clinic or its patrons without consent.[74][75] Citing the Supreme Court's buffer zone decision in *Hill v. Colorado*, the court rejected the plaintiffs' challenge to the ordinance on First Amendment grounds.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Barrett dissented when the court upheld the federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms.[77] The majority rejected the as-applied challenge raised by plaintiff Rickey Kanter, who had been convicted of felony mail fraud, and upheld the felony dispossession statute as \"substantially related to an important government interest in preventing gun violence.\" In her dissent, Barrett argued that while the government has a legitimate interest in denying gun possession to felons convicted of violent crimes, there is no evidence that denying guns to nonviolent felons promotes this interest, and that the law violates the Second Amendment.[78] President Trump pardoned Kanter in December 2020.[79]\n\n\n\n#### Criminal procedure[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2018, Barrett dissented when the panel majority found that an accused murderer's right to counsel was violated when the state trial judge directly questioned the accused while forbidding his attorney from speaking.[80] Following rehearing *en banc*, a majority of the circuit's judges agreed with her position.[81]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it determined that the police had lacked probable cause to search a vehicle based solely upon an anonymous tip that people were \"playing with guns\", because no crime had been alleged.[82] Barrett distinguished *Navarette v. California* and wrote, \"the police were right to respond to the anonymous call by coming to the parking lot to determine what was happening. But determining what was happening and immediately seizing people upon arrival are two different things, and the latter was premature...Watson's case presents a close call. But this one falls on the wrong side of the Fourth Amendment.\"[83]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it found that police officers had been unreasonable to assume \"that a woman who answers the door in a bathrobe has authority to consent to a search of a male suspect's residence.\" Therefore, the district court should have granted the defendant's motion to suppress evidence found in the residence as the fruit of an unconstitutional search.[84][85]\n\n\n\n#### Qualified immunity[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it denied qualified immunity to a civil lawsuit sought by a defendant who as a homicide detective had knowingly provided false and misleading information in the probable cause affidavit that was used to obtain an arrest warrant for the plaintiff.[86] (The charges were later dropped and the plaintiff was released.) The court found the defendant's lies and omissions violated \"clearly established law\" and the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights and thus the detective was not shielded by qualified immunity.[87]\n\n\nIn *Howard v. Koeller* (7th Cir. 2018), in an unsigned order by a three-judge panel that included Barrett, the court found that qualified immunity did not protect a prison officer who had labeled a prisoner a \"snitch\" and thereby exposed him to risk from his fellow inmates.[88][89]\n\n\n\n#### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn *Orchard Hill Building Co. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers*, 893 F.3d 1017 (7th Cir. 2018), Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision, written by Judge Amy J. St. Eve, in a case brought by a property developer challenging the Corps' determination that a wetland 11 mi (18 km) from the nearest navigable river was among the \"waters of the United States.\"[90] The court found that the Corps had not provided substantial evidence of a significant nexus to navigable‐in‐fact waters under Justice Kennedy's concurrence in the Supreme Court's decision in *Rapanos v. United States*. The case was remanded to the Corps to reconsider whether such a significant nexus exists between the wetlands in question and navigable waters for it to maintain jurisdiction over the land.[91][92]\n\n\n\n#### Consumer protection[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2018, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it found that a plaintiff could not sue Teva Pharmaceuticals for alleged defects in her IUD due to the lack of supportive expert testimony, writing, \"the issue of causation in her case is not obvious.\"[93][94][95]\n\n\n\n#### Coronavirus measures[edit]\n\n\nIn early September 2020, Barrett joined Wood's opinion upholding the district court's denial of the Illinois Republican Party's request for a preliminary injunction to block Governor J. B. Pritzker's COVID-19 orders.[30][96] On August 12, 2021, she rejected a challenge to Indiana University's vaccine mandate, marking the first legal test of COVID-19 vaccine mandates before the Supreme Court.[97]\n\n\n\n#### Civil procedure and standing[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it found that the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act cannot create a cause of action for a debtor who received collection letters lacking notices required by the statute because she suffered no injury-in-fact to create constitutional standing to sue under Article III.[98] Wood dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc. The issue created a circuit split.[99][100][101]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it held that a Teamsters local did not have standing to appeal an order in the *Shakman* case because it was not formally a party to the case.[102] The union had not intervened in the action, but rather merely submitted a memorandum in the district court opposing a motion, which the Seventh Circuit determined was insufficient to give the union a right to appeal.[103]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the Supreme Court on September 26, 2020\nBarrett was on Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees since 2017, almost immediately after her court of appeals confirmation.[104] In July 2018, after Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement announcement, she was reportedly one of three finalists Trump considered, along with Kavanaugh and Judge Raymond Kethledge.[36][105][106]\n\n\nAfter Kavanaugh's selection in 2018, Barrett was viewed as a possible nominee for a future U.S. Supreme Court vacancy.[107] After the death of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on September 18, 2020, Barrett was widely mentioned as the front-runner to succeed her.[108] On September 26, 2020, Trump announced his intention to nominate Barrett to fill the vacancy created by Ginsburg's death.[7][109]\n\n\nBarrett's nomination was generally supported by Republicans, who sought to confirm her before the 2020 United States presidential election.[110] She was a favorite among the Christian right and social conservatives.[72][111][112] Democrats generally opposed the nomination, and were opposed to filling the court vacancy while election voting was already underway in many states.[110] Many observers were angered by the move to fill the vacancy only four months before the end of Trump's term, as the Senate Republican majority had refused to consider President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016, more than ten months before the end of his presidency.[110][113][114]\n\n\nIn October, the American Bar Association rated Barrett \"well qualified\" for the Supreme Court opening, its highest rating.[115] The ABA confines its evaluation to the qualities of \"integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament\".[116] Barrett's nomination came during a White House COVID-19 outbreak. On October 5, Senator Lindsey Graham formally scheduled the confirmation hearing,[117] which began on October 12 as planned and lasted four days.[118][119] On October 22, the Judiciary Committee reported her confirmation favorably by a 12–0 vote, with all 10 Democrats boycotting the committee meeting.[120][121] On October 25, the Senate voted mostly along party lines to end debate on the confirmation.[122] On October 26, the Senate confirmed Barrett to the Supreme Court by a vote of 52–48, 30 days after her nomination and 8 days before the 2020 presidential election. Every Republican senator except Susan Collins voted to confirm her, whereas every member of the Senate Democratic Caucus[123] voted in opposition.[124] Barrett is the first justice since 1870 to be confirmed without a single vote from the Senate minority party.[125][126]\n\n\nThe nature of her appointment was criticized by numerous Democratic politicians; Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called it \"the most illegitimate process I have ever witnessed in the Senate.\"[127] Republicans responded that they were merely exercising their constitutional rights, and that accusations of hypocrisy were nothing more than \"an unwarranted tantrum from the left\".[127]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2020–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justice Clarence Thomas administers the oath of office to Barrett on October 26, 2020, at the White House alongside President Donald Trump\n![](image)Chief Justice John Roberts administers the judicial oath to Barrett on October 27, 2020. Justice Barrett's husband, Jesse M. Barrett, holds the Bible.\nBarrett became the 103rd associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States on October 27, 2020. On the evening of the confirmation vote, Trump hosted a swearing-in ceremony at the White House. As Barrett requested, Justice Clarence Thomas administered the oath of office to her,[126][128][129] the first of two necessary oaths. She took the judicial oath, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts, the next day.[130]\n\n\nUpon joining the Court, Barrett became the only justice who did not receive their Juris Doctor from Harvard or Yale.[131] She is also the first justice without an Ivy League degree since the 2010 retirement of John Paul Stevens (who graduated from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University School of Law) and the first to be appointed since Sandra Day O'Connor, who graduated from Stanford University and Stanford Law School.[132] She is the first graduate of Notre Dame Law School and the first former member of the Notre Dame faculty to serve on the Supreme Court.[133]\n\n\nBarrett uses her maiden and married surnames in public. She has chosen to be called \"Justice Barrett\" in written orders and opinions of the court,[134] as she did as a Seventh Circuit judge.[135]\n\n\n\n### Circuit assignment[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Barrett was assigned to the Seventh Circuit.[136] This assignment's duties include responding to emergency applications to the Court that arise from the circuit's jurisdiction, either by herself or else by referring them to the full Court for review.[136][137]\n\n\n\n### Early oral argument participation[edit]\n\n\nHaving hired her allotted four law clerks, Barrett took part in her first oral argument on November 2, hearing the case *U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club.*[138][139]\n\n\nOn November 4, the Court heard *Fulton v. Philadelphia*, in which the plaintiff, Catholic Social Services, sued the city of Philadelphia after being denied a new contract under the city's Fair Practices Ordinance, which bars discrimination in public accommodations. The Archdiocese-affiliated CSS said that for religious reasons it cannot properly vet potential foster parents who are gay couples. CSS argued that under relevant precedent, the Court should find that CSS as a faith-based charity was unfairly singled out, given that the city allows race- and disability-based exceptions within foster-care placements.[140][141] CSS further claimed the law is shown not to be neutral as required by the Court's 1990 decision *Employment Division v. Smith*, which allows the government to enforce neutral and generally applicable laws without having to make exceptions for individual religions, because the city labeled CSS's motives \"discrimination that occurs under the guise of religious freedom.\"[141][142] According to the *New York Times,* Barrett's questions during oral arguments were \"evenhanded and did not reveal her position.\"[143]\n\n\n\n### First votes as a justice[edit]\n\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Barrett joined the Supreme Court's majority in *Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo*,[144] 592 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2020), in an unsigned[145] 5–4 preliminary injunction in favor of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and the Orthodox Jewish organization Agudath Israel of America, saying that certain COVID-19 restrictions instituted by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had likely violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, in that they \"single out houses of worship for especially harsh treatment.\"[146][147][148][149] The Court said that the restrictions had likely impinged on the fundamental right of the free exercise of religion without their (in constitutional legal parlance) passing the legal test of \"strict scrutiny.\"[150] Cuomo's order was more restrictive than governmental orders involved in similar cases involving churches in California and Nevada that the Court had allowed to stand by a 5–4 vote.[151][152][153] Ross Guberman, author of *Point Taken: How to Write Like the World's Best Judges*, told the *Times* he believed Barrett was the principal author of the Court's decision because of its measured tone and word choices, including its use of the word \"show\".[154]\n\n\nBarrett delivered her first concurring opinion on February 5, 2021, in the case *South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom*.[155][156]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, Barrett joined the majority, in a 5–4 vote, to reject a petition to temporarily block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy; Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh joined her in the majority.[157]\nIn June 2022, Barrett joined with the same majority in *Dobbs v. Jackson*, voting to completely overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[158]\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2022, the Supreme Court voted to allow the execution of an inmate to proceed in Alabama; the case was decided by a 5–4 vote, with Barrett joining Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan in dissent.[159]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nBarrett wrote her first majority opinion in *United States Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club*, which was decided on March 4, 2021.[155][160][161] Traditionally the first opinion delivered by a new justice reflects the opinion of a unanimous court, but not always. While Gorsuch and Kavanaugh wrote unanimous first opinions, Barrett, like her predecessor Justice Ginsburg, wrote an opinion for a divided court.[155][162][163]\n\n\nAlthough Barrett ruled against environmentalists in March, she voted against oil refineries in her first dissent, *Hollyfrontier Cheyenne Refining v. Renewable Fuels Association*.[164]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights and issues[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Barrett joined a unanimous decision in *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*, ruling in favor of a Catholic social service agency that had been denied funding from the City of Philadelphia because it does not adopt to same-sex couples; the ruling also declined to overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[165] In the same month, Barrett was among the six justices who rejected the appeal of a Washington State florist whom lower courts had ruled violated non-discrimination laws by refusing to sell floral arrangements to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage, leaving the lower court judgments in place.[166][167][168] In November 2021, Barrett voted with the majority in a 6–3 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[169] The Court's decision not to hear the case left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the transgender patient; Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented.[170][171]\n\n\n\n### Vaccine requirements[edit]\n\n\nBarrett wrote a concurring opinion in *Does v. Mills,* a case challenging Maine's vaccine requirement for health care workers. She was in the majority in the 6–3 decision to deny a stay of the vaccine requirement, explaining that the case had not been fully briefed or argued.*[172]*\n\n\n\n## Judicial philosophy, academic writings, speeches, and political views[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on |\n| Conservatismin the United States |\n| ![](image) |\n| Schools\n* Compassionate\n* Fiscal\n* Fusion\n* Libertarian\n* Moderate\n* Movement\n* Neo\n* Paleo\n* Progressive\n* Social\n* Traditionalist\n |\n| Principles\n* American exceptionalism\n* Anti-communism\n* Christian nationalism\n* Classical liberalism\n* Constitutionalism\n* Familialism\n* Family values\n* Federalism\n\t+ States' rights\n* Judeo-Christian values\n* Individualism\n* Law and order\n* Limited government\n* Militarism\n* Moral absolutism\n* Natural law\n* Patriotism\n* Republicanism\n* Right to bear arms\n* Rule of law\n* Tradition\n |\n| History\n* Conservative coalition\n* Conservative Democrat\n* Conservative Manifesto\n* Loyalists\n* McCarthyism\n* Modern timeline\n* New Right\n* Old Right\n* Overview\n* Reagan Doctrine\n* Reaganomics\n* Stalwart Republicans\n* Southern Agrarians\n |\n| Intellectuals\n* Anton\n* Babbitt\n* Bell\n* Bellow\n* Bloom\n* Boorstin\n* Buckley\n* Burnham\n* Chambers\n* Conquest\n* Derbyshire\n* Dolan\n* Durant\n* Eastman\n* Eliot\n* Francis\n* George\n* Goldberg\n* Gottfried\n* Hanson\n* Hazony\n* Hoppe\n* Jaffa\n* Kimball\n* Kirk\n* Kirkpatrick\n* Kreeft\n* Kristol (Irving)\n* Kuehnelt-Leddihn\n* Laffer\n* Lasch\n* Lovecraft\n* Lukacs\n* Mansfield\n* Mencken\n* Meyer\n* Molnar\n* Murray\n* Nisbet\n* Nock\n* O'Connor\n* Ong\n* Ransom\n* Repplier\n* Santayana\n* Sowell\n* Strauss\n* Sumner\n* Viereck\n* Voegelin\n* Washington\n* Weaver\n* Yarvin\n |\n| Politicians\n* Abbott\n* Adams\n* Quincy Adams\n* Agnew\n* Buchanan\n* Bush (George H.

Jay Schweikert, who advocates for the Court's or Congress's elimination of qualified immunity,[176] believes that her \"decisions all look like reasonable applications of existing precedent.\"[175][177] Legal commentator Jacob Sullum argues that while Barrett was on the Seventh Circuit she took \"a constrained view of the doctrine's scope.\"[178]\n\n\n\n### Textualism and originalism[edit]\n\n\nBarrett is considered a textualist, a proponent of the idea that statutes should be interpreted literally, without considering their legislative history or underlying purpose,[179][180][181][182] and an originalist (of the original-public-meaning, rather than original-intent, variety), a proponent of the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted as perceived at the time of enactment.[179][183][184][185] According to her, \"Originalism is characterized by a commitment to two core principles. First, the meaning of the constitutional text is fixed at the time of its ratification. Second, the historical meaning of the text 'has legal significance and is authoritative in most circumstances.'\"[183] For the purpose of \"describing the disagreement between originalists and nonoriginalists about the authoritativeness of the original public meaning,\" she refers[183] to a section of a law review article by Keith Whittington, \"Originalism: A Critical Introduction\",[186] that reads, \"Critics of originalism have suggested a range of considerations that might trump original meaning if the two were to come into conflict. From this perspective, fidelity to original meaning is not the chief goal of constitutional theory. ...Confronted with suitably unpleasant results, the nonoriginalist might posit that the original meaning should be sacrificed. Alternatively, we might think that contemporary public opinion should trump original meaning. ...Underlying all these considerations is a view that courts are authorized to impose constitutional rules other than those adopted by the constitutional drafters. ...the originalist must insist that judges not close their eyes to the discoverable meaning of the Constitution and announce some other constitutional rule to supersede it. It is at that point that the originalist and the nonoriginalist must part ways.\"[186]\n\n\nTextualism, Barrett says, requires that judges construe statutory language consistent with its \"ordinary meaning\": \"The law is comprised of words—and textualists emphasize that words mean what they say, not what a judge thinks that they ought to say.\" According to Barrett, \"Textualism stands in contrast to purposivism, a method of statutory interpretation that was dominant through much of the 20th century.\" If a court concludes that statutory language appears to be in tension with a statute's overarching goal, \"purposivists argue that a judge should go with the goal rather than the text\". For Barrett, textualism is not literalism, nor is it about rigid dictionary definitions. \"It is about identifying the plain communicative content of the words\".[187]\n\n\nBarrett clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, and has spoken and written of her admiration of his adherence to the text of statutes and to originalism,[188] writing: \"His judicial philosophy is mine, too. A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they may hold.\"[189] In one article she quoted Scalia on the importance of the original meaning of the Constitution: \"The validity of government depends upon the consent of the governed ... [s]o what the people agreed to when they adopted the Constitution ... is what ought to govern us.\"[183] In a 2017 article in the law review *Constitutional Commentary*, reviewing a book by Randy E. Barnett, Barrett wrote: \"The Constitution's original public meaning is important not because adhering to it limits judicial discretion, but because it is the law. ...The Constitution's meaning is fixed until lawfully changed; thus, the court must stick with the original public meaning of the text even if it rules out the preference of a current majority.\"[190][191]\n\n\nAccording to Barrett, textualists believe that when a court interprets the words of statutes, it should use the most natural meaning of those words to an ordinary skilled user of words at the time, even if the court believes that the legislature intended that the words be understood in a different sense. If the legislature wishes the words of a statute to carry a meaning different from how a non-legislator would understand them, it is free to define the terms in the statute. As Scalia put it, \"[A]ll we can know is that [the legislature] voted for a text that they presumably thought would be read the same way any reasonable English speaker would read it.\" Scalia insisted that \"it is simply incompatible with democratic government, or indeed, even with fair government, to have the meaning of a law determined by what the lawgiver meant, rather than by what the lawmaker promulgated.\"[192][193]\n\n\nBarrett has been critical of legal process theory, which gives a more expansive role to theory in shaping the interpretation of law than do textualism and originalism.[192][193] She said that one example of the \"process-based\" approach can be found in *King v. Burwell*, in which the Supreme Court, for reasons related to the unorthodox legislative process that produced the Affordable Care Act, interpreted the phrase \"Exchange established by the State\" to mean \"Exchange established by the State or the federal government.\"[193]\n\n\n\n#### Suspension of habeas corpus[edit]\n\n\nIn a journal article, \"Suspension and Delegation\",[194] Barrett noted that constitutionally only Congress has the authority to decide the terms under which *habeas corpus* may be legitimately suspended.[195] In all but one of the previous suspensions of habeas corpus, Barrett thought that Congress violated the Constitution \"by enacting a suspension statute before an invasion or rebellion occurred—and in some instances, before one was even on the horizon.\"[81][194] In an educational essay, she sided with the dissenters in *Boumediene v. Bush* after considering historical factors.[196]\n\n\n\n### Precedent[edit]\n\n\nAt her 2017 Senate confirmation hearing for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, Barrett said she would follow Supreme Court precedent while on the appellate bench. In 2020, during her nomination acceptance speech at the White House Rose Garden, Barrett said, \"Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold\";[197][198] she also said judges \"must apply the law as written\".[199][200] She explained her view of precedent in response to questions at the hearing.[201]\n\n\nIn a 2013 article in the *Texas Law Review* on the doctrine of *stare decisis*, Barrett listed seven cases that she believed should be considered \"superprecedents\"—cases the Court would never consider overturning. They included *Brown v. Board of Education* and *Mapp v. Ohio* (incorporating the Fourth Amendment onto the states),[202] but specifically excluded *Roe v. Wade* (1973). In explaining why it was excluded, Barrett referenced scholarship agreeing that in order to qualify as \"superprecedent\", a decision must have widespread support from not only jurists but politicians and the public at large to the extent of becoming immune to reversal or challenge (for example, the constitutionality of paper money). She argued that the people must trust a ruling's validity to such an extent that the matter has been taken \"off of the Court's agenda\", with lower courts no longer taking challenges to them seriously. Barrett pointed to *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992) as evidence that *Roe* had not attained this status, and quoted Richard H. Fallon Jr.: \"[A] decision as fiercely and enduringly contested as *Roe v. Wade* has acquired no immunity from serious judicial reconsideration, even if arguments for overruling it ought not succeed.\"[202][203]\n\n\nConcerning the relationship of textualism to precedent, Barrett said, \"It makes sense that one committed to a textualist theory would more often find precedent in conflict with her interpretation of the Constitution than would one who takes a more flexible, all-things-considered approach.\"[202] She referenced a study by Michael Gerhardt which found that, as of 1994, no two justices in that century had called for overruling more precedents than Justices Scalia and Hugo Black, both of whom were textualists, even though Black was a liberal and Scalia a conservative. Gerhardt also found that during the Rehnquist Court's last 11 years, the average number of times a justice called for the overruling of precedent was higher for textualist justices, with one per year coming from Ginsburg (non-textualist) up to just over two per year from Thomas (textualist). Gerhardt wrote that not all the calls for overruling were related to textualism issues, and that one must be careful in the inferences one draws from the numbers, which \"do not indicate either why or on what basis the justices urged overruling.\"[202]\n\n\n\n### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Barrett signed a letter criticizing the Obama administration's approach to providing employees of religious institutions with birth control coverage without having the religious institutions pay for it, calling it an \"assault\" to religious liberty.[204]\n\n\nBarrett has been critical of the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts in *National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius* (2012), which upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. She wrote in 2017: \"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did—as a penalty—he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress's commerce power.\"[191][205][204][206]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nBarrett opposes abortion.[207][208] In 2006, she signed an advertisement placed by St. Joseph County Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, in a South Bend, Indiana, newspaper. The ad read: \"We, the following citizens of Michiana, oppose abortion on demand and defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death. Please continue to pray to end abortion.\" An unsigned, second page of the advertisement read, \"It's time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of *Roe v. Wade* and restore laws that protect the lives of unborn children.\"[209][210][211] In 2013, Barrett signed another ad against *Roe v. Wade* that appeared in Notre Dame's student newspaper and described the decision as having \"killed 55 million unborn children\". The same year, she spoke at two anti-abortion events at the university.[212]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barrett and her family with President Trump on September 26, 2020\n![](image)Then-Judge Barrett with her husband, Jesse, in 2018\nIn 1999, Barrett married fellow Notre Dame Law School graduate Jesse M. Barrett, a partner at SouthBank Legal – LaDue Curran & Kuehn LLC, in South Bend, Indiana,[213] and a law professor at Notre Dame Law School.[214] Previously, Jesse Barrett had worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana for 13 years.[215] The couple live in South Bend and have seven children, two of whom were adopted from Haiti, one in 2005 and one after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[32][216] Their youngest biological child has Down syndrome.[217]\n\n\nBarrett is a practicing Catholic.[218] Since birth, she has been a member of the Christian parachurch community People of Praise,[219] an ecumenical covenant community founded in South Bend. Associated with the Catholic charismatic renewal movement but not formally affiliated with the Catholic Church,[220][221][222] about 90% of its approximately 1,700 members are Catholic.[220][222] In People of Praise, Barrett has served as a laypastoral women's leader in a position once termed \"handmaiden\" but now termed \"women leader\".[223][224]\n\n\nAccording to *Politico*, \"a copy of Barrett's ballot history from the Indiana Statewide Voter Registration System obtained by POLITICO [shows] Barrett voted in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, and the 2016 Republican primary, though she pulled a Democratic ballot in the 2011 primary.\"[38]\n\n\n\n## Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nBarrett was a member of the Federalist Society from 2005 to 2006 and from 2014 to 2017.[48][27][29] She is a member of the American Law Institute.[225]\n\n\n\n## Selected publications[edit]\n\n\nA partial list of Barrett's academic publications:[226]\n\n\n\n* Amy Coney Barrett; John H.

Barrett was a U.S. circuit judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit from 2017 to 2020.\n\n\nBarrett graduated from Rhodes College before attending Notre Dame Law School, earning a J.D. with distinction in 1997. She then clerked for Judge Laurence Silberman and Justice Antonin Scalia. In 2002, Barrett joined the faculty at Notre Dame Law School, becoming a professor in 2010. While serving on the federal bench, she has continued to teach civil procedure, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nOn September 26, 2020, Trump nominated Barrett to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court of the United States.[6][7][8] Her nomination was controversial because the 2020 presidential election was only 38 days away and Senate Republicans had refused to hold hearings for Merrick Garland during an election year in 2016.[9] The next month, the U.S. Senate voted 52–48 to confirm her nomination, with all Democrats and one Republican in opposition.[10]\n\n\nDescribed as a protégée of Justice Antonin Scalia,[11][12][13] Barrett supports textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in constitutional interpretation.[14][15][16] She is generally considered to be among the Court's conservative bloc.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAmy Vivian Coney was born in 1972 in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Linda (*née* Vath) and Michael Coney.[17][18] The eldest of seven children, she has five sisters and a brother. Her father worked as an attorney for Shell Oil Company, and her mother was a high school French teacher and homemaker. Barrett has Irish and French ancestry.[19][20] Her maternal ancestors were from Ballyconnell, County Cavan, Ireland, while there is also Irish lineage among her father's ancestors. Her great-great-grandparents emigrated from France to New Orleans.[21] Her family is devoutly Catholic, and her father is an ordained deacon at St. Catherine of Siena Parish in Metairie, Louisiana, where she grew up.[22][23]\n\n\nBarrett attended St. Mary's Dominican High School, an all-girls Roman Catholic high school in New Orleans.[24] She was student body vice president of the school and graduated in 1990.[25] After high school, Barrett attended Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, where she majored in English literature and minored in French. She considers herself \"somewhat fluent\" in French, but with a Louisiana accent.[26] Barrett graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts, *magna cum laude*, and was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa and Phi Beta Kappa.[27] In her graduating class, she was named most outstanding English department graduate.[28]\n\n\nBarrett then attended Notre Dame Law School on a full-tuition scholarship. She was an executive editor of the *Notre Dame Law Review* and graduated in 1997 ranked first in her class with a Juris Doctor, *summa cum laude*.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Legal career[edit]\n\n\n### Clerkships and private practice[edit]\n\n\nBarrett spent two years as a judicial law clerk after law school, first for Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1997 to 1998, and then for Justice Antonin Scalia of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1998 to 1999.[30]\n\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Barrett practiced law at Miller Cassidy Larroca & Lewin, a boutique law firm for litigation in Washington, D.C., that merged with the Houston, Texas-based law firm Baker Botts in 2001.[29][31] While at Baker Botts, she worked on *Bush v. Gore*, the lawsuit that grew out of the 2000 United States presidential election, providing research and briefing assistance for the firm's representation of George W. Bush.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and scholarship[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, Barrett was a visiting associate professor and John M. Olin Fellow in Law at George Washington University Law School. In 2002, she joined the faculty of her alma mater, Notre Dame Law School.[34] At Notre Dame, she taught federal courts, evidence, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation. In 2007, she was a visiting professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.[35] Barrett was named a professor of law at Notre Dame in 2010, and from 2014 to 2017 held Notre Dame's Diane and M.O. Miller II Research Chair of Law.[36] Her scholarship focused on constitutional law, originalism, statutory interpretation, and *stare decisis*.[28] Her academic work has been published in the *Columbia*, *Cornell*, *Virginia*, *Notre Dame*, and *Texas* law reviews.[34]\n\n\nAt Notre Dame, Barrett received the \"Distinguished Professor of the Year\" award three times.[34] From 2011 to 2016, she spoke on constitutional law at Blackstone Legal Fellowship, a summer program for law school students that the Alliance Defending Freedom established to inspire a \"distinctly Christian worldview in every area of law\".[37] While serving on the Seventh Circuit, Barrett commuted between Chicago and South Bend, continuing to teach courses on statutory interpretation and constitutional theory.[38][39]\n\n\nIn 2010, Chief Justice John Roberts appointed Barrett to serve on the Advisory Committee for the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.[34]\n\n\n\n## Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (2017–2020)[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nFile:Prof Amy Coney Barrett 2 10.jpgBarrett before the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 6, 2017\nOn May 8, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit—the federal appellate court covering Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin—after Judge John Daniel Tinder took senior status.[5][40] A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on her nomination was held on September 6, 2017.[41] During the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein questioned Barrett about a law review article Barrett co-wrote in 1998 with Professor John H. Garvey in which they argued that Catholic judges should in some cases recuse themselves from death penalty cases due to their moral objections to the death penalty.[42] Asked to \"elaborate on the statements and discuss how you view the issue of faith versus fulfilling the responsibility as a judge today,\" Barrett said that she had participated in many death-penalty appeals while serving as law clerk to Scalia, adding, \"My personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear on the discharge of my duties as a judge\"[43][44] and \"It is never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge's personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law.\"[45] Barrett emphasized that the article was written in her third year in law school and that she was \"very much the junior partner in our collaboration.\"[46] Worried that Barrett would not uphold *Roe v. Wade* given her Catholic beliefs, Feinstein followed Barrett's response by saying, \"the dogma lives loudly within you, and that is a concern.\"[47][48][49]\n\n\nThe hearing made Barrett popular with religious conservatives.[29] Feinstein's and other senators' questioning was criticized by some Republicans and other observers, such as university presidents John I. Jenkins of the University of Notre Dame and Christopher Eisgruber of Princeton, as an improper inquiry into a nominee's religious belief that employed an unconstitutional \"religious test\" for office;[45][50] others, such as Nan Aron, defended Feinstein's line of questioning.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Judge Laurence Silberman, for whom Barrett first clerked after law school, swearing her in at her investiture for the Seventh Circuit in 2018\nLambda Legal, an LGBT civil rights organization, co-signed a letter with 26 other gay rights organizations opposing Barrett's nomination. The letter expressed doubts about her ability to separate faith from her rulings on LGBT matters.[52][53] During her Senate hearing, Barrett was questioned about landmark LGBTQ legal precedents such as *Obergefell v. Hodges*, *United States v. Windsor*, and *Lawrence v. Texas*. She said these cases are \"binding precedents\" that she intended to \"faithfully follow if confirmed\" to the appeals court, as required by law.[52] The letter Lambda Legal co-signed read, \"Simply repeating that she would be bound by Supreme Court precedent does not illuminate—indeed, it obfuscates—how Professor Barrett would interpret and apply precedent when faced with the sorts of dilemmas that, in her view, 'put Catholic judges in a bind.'\"[52]\n\n\nBarrett's nomination was supported by every law clerk she had worked with and all of her 49 faculty colleagues at Notre Dame Law school. 450 former students signed a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee supporting her nomination.[54][55]\n\n\nOn October 5, 2017, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11–9 on party lines to recommend Barrett and report her nomination to the full Senate.[56][57] On October 30, the Senate invoked cloture by a vote of 54–42.[58] It confirmed her by a vote of 55–43 on October 31, with three Democrats—Joe Donnelly, Tim Kaine, and Joe Manchin—voting for her.[27] She received her commission two days later.[2] Barrett is the first and only woman to occupy an Indiana seat on the Seventh Circuit.[59]\n\n\n\n### Selected cases[edit]\n\n\nOral arguments from *Cook County, Illinois v. Chad F. Wolf*, one of the last cases that Barrett took in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020\nOn the Seventh Circuit, Barrett wrote 79 majority opinions (including two that were amended and one that was withdrawn on rehearing), four concurring opinions (one a per curiam opinion), and six dissenting opinions (six published and one in an unpublished order).[35]\n\n\n\n#### Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, the court, in a unanimous decision written by Barrett, reinstated a suit brought by a male Purdue University student (John Doe) who had been found guilty of sexual assault by Purdue University, which resulted in a one-year suspension, loss of his Navy ROTC scholarship, and expulsion from the ROTC affecting his ability to pursue his chosen career in the Navy.[60][61] Doe alleged the school's Advisory Committee on Equity discriminated against him on the basis of his sex and violated his rights to due process by not interviewing the alleged victim, not allowing him to present evidence in his defense, including an erroneous statement that he confessed to some of the alleged assault, and appearing to believe the victim instead of the accused without hearing from either party or having even read the investigation report. The court found that Doe had adequately alleged that the university deprived him of his occupational liberty without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and had violated his Title IX rights \"by imposing a punishment infected by sex bias\", and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.[62][63]\n\n\n\n#### Employment discrimination[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, the Seventh Circuit rejected the federal government's appeal in a civil lawsuit against AutoZone; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission argued that AutoZone's assignment of employees to different stores based on race (e.g., \"sending African American employees to stores in heavily African American neighborhoods\") violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Following this, Barrett joined the court as it received a petition for rehearing *en banc*. Three judges—Chief Judge Diane Wood and judges Ilana Rovner and David Hamilton—voted to grant rehearing, and criticized the three-judge panel's opinion as upholding a \"separate-but-equal arrangement\". Barrett did not join the panel opinion, but voted with four judges to deny the petition to rehear the case. The petition was unsuccessful by a 5–3 decision.[64][29]\n\n\nIn 2019, Barrett wrote the unanimous three-judge panel opinion affirming summary judgment in the case of *Smith v. Illinois Department of Transportation*. Smith was a Black employee who claimed racial discrimination upon his dismissal by the department and that he was called a \"stupid-ass nigger\" by a Black supervisor; the department claimed Smith failed work-level expectations during probationary periods. Barrett wrote that usage of the racial slur was egregious, but Smith's testimony showed no evidence that his subjective experience of the workplace changed because of the slur, nor did it change the department's fact that his discharge was related to \"poor performance\".[65][66]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Barrett wrote a 40-page dissent when the majority upheld a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration's controversial \"public charge rule\", which heightened the standard for obtaining a green card.[67] In her dissent, she argued that any noncitizens who disenrolled from government benefits because of the rule did so due to confusion about the rule itself rather than from its application, writing that the vast majority of the people subject to the rule are not eligible for government benefits in the first place. On the merits, Barrett departed from her colleagues Wood and Rovner, who held that DHS's interpretation of that provision was unreasonable under *Chevron* Step Two. Barrett would have held that the new rule fell within the broad scope of discretion granted to the Executive by Congress through the Immigration and Nationality Act.[68] The public charge issue is the subject of a circuit split.[68][69]\n\n\nIn May 2019, the court rejected a Yemeni citizen and her U.S. citizen husband's challenge to a consular officer's decision to twice deny her visa application under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The U.S. citizen argued that this had deprived him of a constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse.[70] In a 2–1 majority opinion authored by Barrett, the court held that the plaintiff's claim was properly dismissed under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. Barrett declined to address whether the husband had been denied a constitutional right (or whether the constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse existed at all) because the consular officer's decision to deny the visa application was facially legitimate and bona fide, and under Supreme Court precedent, in such a case courts will not \"look behind the exercise of that discretion\". The dispute concerned what it takes to satisfy this standard. A petition for rehearing *en banc* was denied, with Chief Judge Wood, joined by Rovner and Hamilton, dissenting. Barrett wrote a rare opinion concurring in the denial of rehearing *en banc* (joined by Judge Joel Flaum).[70][71]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion-related cases[edit]\n\n\nBarrett had never ruled directly on abortion before joining the Supreme Court, but she did vote to rehear a successful challenge to Indiana's parental notification law in 2019. In 2018, she voted against striking down another Indiana law requiring burial or cremation of fetal remains. In both cases, Barrett voted with the minority. The Supreme Court later reinstated the fetal remains law, and in July 2020 it ordered a rehearing in the parental notification case.[72][73]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision upholding a Chicago \"bubble ordinance\" that prohibits approaching within a certain distance of an abortion clinic or its patrons without consent.[74][75] Citing the Supreme Court's buffer zone decision in *Hill v. Colorado*, the court rejected the plaintiffs' challenge to the ordinance on First Amendment grounds.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Barrett dissented when the court upheld the federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms.[77] The majority rejected the as-applied challenge raised by plaintiff Rickey Kanter, who had been convicted of felony mail fraud, and upheld the felony dispossession statute as \"substantially related to an important government interest in preventing gun violence.\" In her dissent, Barrett argued that while the government has a legitimate interest in denying gun possession to felons convicted of violent crimes, there is no evidence that denying guns to nonviolent felons promotes this interest, and that the law violates the Second Amendment.[78] President Trump pardoned Kanter in December 2020.[79]\n\n\n\n#### Criminal procedure[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2018, Barrett dissented when the panel majority found that an accused murderer's right to counsel was violated when the state trial judge directly questioned the accused while forbidding his attorney from speaking.[80] Following rehearing *en banc*, a majority of the circuit's judges agreed with her position.[81]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it determined that the police had lacked probable cause to search a vehicle based solely upon an anonymous tip that people were \"playing with guns\", because no crime had been alleged.[82] Barrett distinguished *Navarette v. California* and wrote, \"the police were right to respond to the anonymous call by coming to the parking lot to determine what was happening. But determining what was happening and immediately seizing people upon arrival are two different things, and the latter was premature...Watson's case presents a close call. But this one falls on the wrong side of the Fourth Amendment.\"[83]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it found that police officers had been unreasonable to assume \"that a woman who answers the door in a bathrobe has authority to consent to a search of a male suspect's residence.\" Therefore, the district court should have granted the defendant's motion to suppress evidence found in the residence as the fruit of an unconstitutional search.[84][85]\n\n\n\n#### Qualified immunity[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it denied qualified immunity to a civil lawsuit sought by a defendant who as a homicide detective had knowingly provided false and misleading information in the probable cause affidavit that was used to obtain an arrest warrant for the plaintiff.[86] (The charges were later dropped and the plaintiff was released.) The court found the defendant's lies and omissions violated \"clearly established law\" and the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights and thus the detective was not shielded by qualified immunity.[87]\n\n\nIn *Howard v. Koeller* (7th Cir. 2018), in an unsigned order by a three-judge panel that included Barrett, the court found that qualified immunity did not protect a prison officer who had labeled a prisoner a \"snitch\" and thereby exposed him to risk from his fellow inmates.[88][89]\n\n\n\n#### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn *Orchard Hill Building Co. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers*, 893 F.3d 1017 (7th Cir. 2018), Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision, written by Judge Amy J. St. Eve, in a case brought by a property developer challenging the Corps' determination that a wetland 11 mi (18 km) from the nearest navigable river was among the \"waters of the United States.\"[90] The court found that the Corps had not provided substantial evidence of a significant nexus to navigable‐in‐fact waters under Justice Kennedy's concurrence in the Supreme Court's decision in *Rapanos v. United States*. The case was remanded to the Corps to reconsider whether such a significant nexus exists between the wetlands in question and navigable waters for it to maintain jurisdiction over the land.[91][92]\n\n\n\n#### Consumer protection[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2018, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it found that a plaintiff could not sue Teva Pharmaceuticals for alleged defects in her IUD due to the lack of supportive expert testimony, writing, \"the issue of causation in her case is not obvious.\"[93][94][95]\n\n\n\n#### Coronavirus measures[edit]\n\n\nIn early September 2020, Barrett joined Wood's opinion upholding the district court's denial of the Illinois Republican Party's request for a preliminary injunction to block Governor J. B. Pritzker's COVID-19 orders.[30][96] On August 12, 2021, she rejected a challenge to Indiana University's vaccine mandate, marking the first legal test of COVID-19 vaccine mandates before the Supreme Court.[97]\n\n\n\n#### Civil procedure and standing[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it found that the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act cannot create a cause of action for a debtor who received collection letters lacking notices required by the statute because she suffered no injury-in-fact to create constitutional standing to sue under Article III.[98] Wood dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc. The issue created a circuit split.[99][100][101]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it held that a Teamsters local did not have standing to appeal an order in the *Shakman* case because it was not formally a party to the case.[102] The union had not intervened in the action, but rather merely submitted a memorandum in the district court opposing a motion, which the Seventh Circuit determined was insufficient to give the union a right to appeal.[103]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the Supreme Court on September 26, 2020\nBarrett was on Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees since 2017, almost immediately after her court of appeals confirmation.[104] In July 2018, after Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement announcement, she was reportedly one of three finalists Trump considered, along with Kavanaugh and Judge Raymond Kethledge.[36][105][106]\n\n\nAfter Kavanaugh's selection in 2018, Barrett was viewed as a possible nominee for a future U.S. Supreme Court vacancy.[107] After the death of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on September 18, 2020, Barrett was widely mentioned as the front-runner to succeed her.[108] On September 26, 2020, Trump announced his intention to nominate Barrett to fill the vacancy created by Ginsburg's death.[7][109]\n\n\nBarrett's nomination was generally supported by Republicans, who sought to confirm her before the 2020 United States presidential election.[110] She was a favorite among the Christian right and social conservatives.[72][111][112] Democrats generally opposed the nomination, and were opposed to filling the court vacancy while election voting was already underway in many states.[110] Many observers were angered by the move to fill the vacancy only four months before the end of Trump's term, as the Senate Republican majority had refused to consider President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016, more than ten months before the end of his presidency.[110][113][114]\n\n\nIn October, the American Bar Association rated Barrett \"well qualified\" for the Supreme Court opening, its highest rating.[115] The ABA confines its evaluation to the qualities of \"integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament\".[116] Barrett's nomination came during a White House COVID-19 outbreak. On October 5, Senator Lindsey Graham formally scheduled the confirmation hearing,[117] which began on October 12 as planned and lasted four days.[118][119] On October 22, the Judiciary Committee reported her confirmation favorably by a 12–0 vote, with all 10 Democrats boycotting the committee meeting.[120][121] On October 25, the Senate voted mostly along party lines to end debate on the confirmation.[122] On October 26, the Senate confirmed Barrett to the Supreme Court by a vote of 52–48, 30 days after her nomination and 8 days before the 2020 presidential election. Every Republican senator except Susan Collins voted to confirm her, whereas every member of the Senate Democratic Caucus[123] voted in opposition.[124] Barrett is the first justice since 1870 to be confirmed without a single vote from the Senate minority party.[125][126]\n\n\nThe nature of her appointment was criticized by numerous Democratic politicians; Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called it \"the most illegitimate process I have ever witnessed in the Senate.\"[127] Republicans responded that they were merely exercising their constitutional rights, and that accusations of hypocrisy were nothing more than \"an unwarranted tantrum from the left\".[127]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2020–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justice Clarence Thomas administers the oath of office to Barrett on October 26, 2020, at the White House alongside President Donald Trump\n![](image)Chief Justice John Roberts administers the judicial oath to Barrett on October 27, 2020. Justice Barrett's husband, Jesse M. Barrett, holds the Bible.\nBarrett became the 103rd associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States on October 27, 2020. On the evening of the confirmation vote, Trump hosted a swearing-in ceremony at the White House. As Barrett requested, Justice Clarence Thomas administered the oath of office to her,[126][128][129] the first of two necessary oaths. She took the judicial oath, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts, the next day.[130]\n\n\nUpon joining the Court, Barrett became the only justice who did not receive their Juris Doctor from Harvard or Yale.[131] She is also the first justice without an Ivy League degree since the 2010 retirement of John Paul Stevens (who graduated from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University School of Law) and the first to be appointed since Sandra Day O'Connor, who graduated from Stanford University and Stanford Law School.[132] She is the first graduate of Notre Dame Law School and the first former member of the Notre Dame faculty to serve on the Supreme Court.[133]\n\n\nBarrett uses her maiden and married surnames in public. She has chosen to be called \"Justice Barrett\" in written orders and opinions of the court,[134] as she did as a Seventh Circuit judge.[135]\n\n\n\n### Circuit assignment[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Barrett was assigned to the Seventh Circuit.[136] This assignment's duties include responding to emergency applications to the Court that arise from the circuit's jurisdiction, either by herself or else by referring them to the full Court for review.[136][137]\n\n\n\n### Early oral argument participation[edit]\n\n\nHaving hired her allotted four law clerks, Barrett took part in her first oral argument on November 2, hearing the case *U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club.*[138][139]\n\n\nOn November 4, the Court heard *Fulton v. Philadelphia*, in which the plaintiff, Catholic Social Services, sued the city of Philadelphia after being denied a new contract under the city's Fair Practices Ordinance, which bars discrimination in public accommodations. The Archdiocese-affiliated CSS said that for religious reasons it cannot properly vet potential foster parents who are gay couples. CSS argued that under relevant precedent, the Court should find that CSS as a faith-based charity was unfairly singled out, given that the city allows race- and disability-based exceptions within foster-care placements.[140][141] CSS further claimed the law is shown not to be neutral as required by the Court's 1990 decision *Employment Division v. Smith*, which allows the government to enforce neutral and generally applicable laws without having to make exceptions for individual religions, because the city labeled CSS's motives \"discrimination that occurs under the guise of religious freedom.\"[141][142] According to the *New York Times,* Barrett's questions during oral arguments were \"evenhanded and did not reveal her position.\"[143]\n\n\n\n### First votes as a justice[edit]\n\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Barrett joined the Supreme Court's majority in *Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo*,[144] 592 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2020), in an unsigned[145] 5–4 preliminary injunction in favor of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and the Orthodox Jewish organization Agudath Israel of America, saying that certain COVID-19 restrictions instituted by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had likely violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, in that they \"single out houses of worship for especially harsh treatment.\"[146][147][148][149] The Court said that the restrictions had likely impinged on the fundamental right of the free exercise of religion without their (in constitutional legal parlance) passing the legal test of \"strict scrutiny.\"[150] Cuomo's order was more restrictive than governmental orders involved in similar cases involving churches in California and Nevada that the Court had allowed to stand by a 5–4 vote.[151][152][153] Ross Guberman, author of *Point Taken: How to Write Like the World's Best Judges*, told the *Times* he believed Barrett was the principal author of the Court's decision because of its measured tone and word choices, including its use of the word \"show\".[154]\n\n\nBarrett delivered her first concurring opinion on February 5, 2021, in the case *South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom*.[155][156]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, Barrett joined the majority, in a 5–4 vote, to reject a petition to temporarily block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy; Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh joined her in the majority.[157]\nIn June 2022, Barrett joined with the same majority in *Dobbs v. Jackson*, voting to completely overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[158]\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2022, the Supreme Court voted to allow the execution of an inmate to proceed in Alabama; the case was decided by a 5–4 vote, with Barrett joining Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan in dissent.[159]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nBarrett wrote her first majority opinion in *United States Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club*, which was decided on March 4, 2021.[155][160][161] Traditionally the first opinion delivered by a new justice reflects the opinion of a unanimous court, but not always. While Gorsuch and Kavanaugh wrote unanimous first opinions, Barrett, like her predecessor Justice Ginsburg, wrote an opinion for a divided court.[155][162][163]\n\n\nAlthough Barrett ruled against environmentalists in March, she voted against oil refineries in her first dissent, *Hollyfrontier Cheyenne Refining v. Renewable Fuels Association*.[164]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights and issues[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Barrett joined a unanimous decision in *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*, ruling in favor of a Catholic social service agency that had been denied funding from the City of Philadelphia because it does not adopt to same-sex couples; the ruling also declined to overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[165] In the same month, Barrett was among the six justices who rejected the appeal of a Washington State florist whom lower courts had ruled violated non-discrimination laws by refusing to sell floral arrangements to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage, leaving the lower court judgments in place.[166][167][168] In November 2021, Barrett voted with the majority in a 6–3 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[169] The Court's decision not to hear the case left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the transgender patient; Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented.[170][171]\n\n\n\n### Vaccine requirements[edit]\n\n\nBarrett wrote a concurring opinion in *Does v.

Jay Schweikert, who advocates for the Court's or Congress's elimination of qualified immunity,[176] believes that her \"decisions all look like reasonable applications of existing precedent.\"[175][177] Legal commentator Jacob Sullum argues that while Barrett was on the Seventh Circuit she took \"a constrained view of the doctrine's scope.\"[178]\n\n\n\n### Textualism and originalism[edit]\n\n\nBarrett is considered a textualist, a proponent of the idea that statutes should be interpreted literally, without considering their legislative history or underlying purpose,[179][180][181][182] and an originalist (of the original-public-meaning, rather than original-intent, variety), a proponent of the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted as perceived at the time of enactment.[179][183][184][185] According to her, \"Originalism is characterized by a commitment to two core principles. First, the meaning of the constitutional text is fixed at the time of its ratification. Second, the historical meaning of the text 'has legal significance and is authoritative in most circumstances.'\"[183] For the purpose of \"describing the disagreement between originalists and nonoriginalists about the authoritativeness of the original public meaning,\" she refers[183] to a section of a law review article by Keith Whittington, \"Originalism: A Critical Introduction\",[186] that reads, \"Critics of originalism have suggested a range of considerations that might trump original meaning if the two were to come into conflict. From this perspective, fidelity to original meaning is not the chief goal of constitutional theory. ...Confronted with suitably unpleasant results, the nonoriginalist might posit that the original meaning should be sacrificed. Alternatively, we might think that contemporary public opinion should trump original meaning. ...Underlying all these considerations is a view that courts are authorized to impose constitutional rules other than those adopted by the constitutional drafters. ...the originalist must insist that judges not close their eyes to the discoverable meaning of the Constitution and announce some other constitutional rule to supersede it. It is at that point that the originalist and the nonoriginalist must part ways.\"[186]\n\n\nTextualism, Barrett says, requires that judges construe statutory language consistent with its \"ordinary meaning\": \"The law is comprised of words—and textualists emphasize that words mean what they say, not what a judge thinks that they ought to say.\" According to Barrett, \"Textualism stands in contrast to purposivism, a method of statutory interpretation that was dominant through much of the 20th century.\" If a court concludes that statutory language appears to be in tension with a statute's overarching goal, \"purposivists argue that a judge should go with the goal rather than the text\". For Barrett, textualism is not literalism, nor is it about rigid dictionary definitions. \"It is about identifying the plain communicative content of the words\".[187]\n\n\nBarrett clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, and has spoken and written of her admiration of his adherence to the text of statutes and to originalism,[188] writing: \"His judicial philosophy is mine, too. A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they may hold.\"[189] In one article she quoted Scalia on the importance of the original meaning of the Constitution: \"The validity of government depends upon the consent of the governed ... [s]o what the people agreed to when they adopted the Constitution ... is what ought to govern us.\"[183] In a 2017 article in the law review *Constitutional Commentary*, reviewing a book by Randy E. Barnett, Barrett wrote: \"The Constitution's original public meaning is important not because adhering to it limits judicial discretion, but because it is the law. ...The Constitution's meaning is fixed until lawfully changed; thus, the court must stick with the original public meaning of the text even if it rules out the preference of a current majority.\"[190][191]\n\n\nAccording to Barrett, textualists believe that when a court interprets the words of statutes, it should use the most natural meaning of those words to an ordinary skilled user of words at the time, even if the court believes that the legislature intended that the words be understood in a different sense. If the legislature wishes the words of a statute to carry a meaning different from how a non-legislator would understand them, it is free to define the terms in the statute. As Scalia put it, \"[A]ll we can know is that [the legislature] voted for a text that they presumably thought would be read the same way any reasonable English speaker would read it.\" Scalia insisted that \"it is simply incompatible with democratic government, or indeed, even with fair government, to have the meaning of a law determined by what the lawgiver meant, rather than by what the lawmaker promulgated.\"[192][193]\n\n\nBarrett has been critical of legal process theory, which gives a more expansive role to theory in shaping the interpretation of law than do textualism and originalism.[192][193] She said that one example of the \"process-based\" approach can be found in *King v. Burwell*, in which the Supreme Court, for reasons related to the unorthodox legislative process that produced the Affordable Care Act, interpreted the phrase \"Exchange established by the State\" to mean \"Exchange established by the State or the federal government.\"[193]\n\n\n\n#### Suspension of habeas corpus[edit]\n\n\nIn a journal article, \"Suspension and Delegation\",[194] Barrett noted that constitutionally only Congress has the authority to decide the terms under which *habeas corpus* may be legitimately suspended.[195] In all but one of the previous suspensions of habeas corpus, Barrett thought that Congress violated the Constitution \"by enacting a suspension statute before an invasion or rebellion occurred—and in some instances, before one was even on the horizon.\"[81][194] In an educational essay, she sided with the dissenters in *Boumediene v. Bush* after considering historical factors.[196]\n\n\n\n### Precedent[edit]\n\n\nAt her 2017 Senate confirmation hearing for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, Barrett said she would follow Supreme Court precedent while on the appellate bench. In 2020, during her nomination acceptance speech at the White House Rose Garden, Barrett said, \"Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold\";[197][198] she also said judges \"must apply the law as written\".[199][200] She explained her view of precedent in response to questions at the hearing.[201]\n\n\nIn a 2013 article in the *Texas Law Review* on the doctrine of *stare decisis*, Barrett listed seven cases that she believed should be considered \"superprecedents\"—cases the Court would never consider overturning. They included *Brown v. Board of Education* and *Mapp v. Ohio* (incorporating the Fourth Amendment onto the states),[202] but specifically excluded *Roe v. Wade* (1973). In explaining why it was excluded, Barrett referenced scholarship agreeing that in order to qualify as \"superprecedent\", a decision must have widespread support from not only jurists but politicians and the public at large to the extent of becoming immune to reversal or challenge (for example, the constitutionality of paper money). She argued that the people must trust a ruling's validity to such an extent that the matter has been taken \"off of the Court's agenda\", with lower courts no longer taking challenges to them seriously. Barrett pointed to *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992) as evidence that *Roe* had not attained this status, and quoted Richard H. Fallon Jr.: \"[A] decision as fiercely and enduringly contested as *Roe v. Wade* has acquired no immunity from serious judicial reconsideration, even if arguments for overruling it ought not succeed.\"[202][203]\n\n\nConcerning the relationship of textualism to precedent, Barrett said, \"It makes sense that one committed to a textualist theory would more often find precedent in conflict with her interpretation of the Constitution than would one who takes a more flexible, all-things-considered approach.\"[202] She referenced a study by Michael Gerhardt which found that, as of 1994, no two justices in that century had called for overruling more precedents than Justices Scalia and Hugo Black, both of whom were textualists, even though Black was a liberal and Scalia a conservative. Gerhardt also found that during the Rehnquist Court's last 11 years, the average number of times a justice called for the overruling of precedent was higher for textualist justices, with one per year coming from Ginsburg (non-textualist) up to just over two per year from Thomas (textualist). Gerhardt wrote that not all the calls for overruling were related to textualism issues, and that one must be careful in the inferences one draws from the numbers, which \"do not indicate either why or on what basis the justices urged overruling.\"[202]\n\n\n\n### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Barrett signed a letter criticizing the Obama administration's approach to providing employees of religious institutions with birth control coverage without having the religious institutions pay for it, calling it an \"assault\" to religious liberty.[204]\n\n\nBarrett has been critical of the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts in *National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius* (2012), which upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. She wrote in 2017: \"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did—as a penalty—he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress's commerce power.\"[191][205][204][206]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nBarrett opposes abortion.[207][208] In 2006, she signed an advertisement placed by St. Joseph County Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, in a South Bend, Indiana, newspaper. The ad read: \"We, the following citizens of Michiana, oppose abortion on demand and defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death. Please continue to pray to end abortion.\" An unsigned, second page of the advertisement read, \"It's time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of *Roe v. Wade* and restore laws that protect the lives of unborn children.\"[209][210][211] In 2013, Barrett signed another ad against *Roe v. Wade* that appeared in Notre Dame's student newspaper and described the decision as having \"killed 55 million unborn children\". The same year, she spoke at two anti-abortion events at the university.[212]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barrett and her family with President Trump on September 26, 2020\n![](image)Then-Judge Barrett with her husband, Jesse, in 2018\nIn 1999, Barrett married fellow Notre Dame Law School graduate Jesse M. Barrett, a partner at SouthBank Legal – LaDue Curran & Kuehn LLC, in South Bend, Indiana,[213] and a law professor at Notre Dame Law School.[214] Previously, Jesse Barrett had worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana for 13 years.[215] The couple live in South Bend and have seven children, two of whom were adopted from Haiti, one in 2005 and one after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[32][216] Their youngest biological child has Down syndrome.[217]\n\n\nBarrett is a practicing Catholic.[218] Since birth, she has been a member of the Christian parachurch community People of Praise,[219] an ecumenical covenant community founded in South Bend. Associated with the Catholic charismatic renewal movement but not formally affiliated with the Catholic Church,[220][221][222] about 90% of its approximately 1,700 members are Catholic.[220][222] In People of Praise, Barrett has served as a laypastoral women's leader in a position once termed \"handmaiden\" but now termed \"women leader\".[223][224]\n\n\nAccording to *Politico*, \"a copy of Barrett's ballot history from the Indiana Statewide Voter Registration System obtained by POLITICO [shows] Barrett voted in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, and the 2016 Republican primary, though she pulled a Democratic ballot in the 2011 primary.\"[38]\n\n\n\n## Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nBarrett was a member of the Federalist Society from 2005 to 2006 and from 2014 to 2017.[48][27][29] She is a member of the American Law Institute.[225]\n\n\n\n## Selected publications[edit]\n\n\nA partial list of Barrett's academic publications:[226]\n\n\n\n* Amy Coney Barrett; John H.

He was nominated by President Donald Trump on July 9, 2018, and has served since October 6, 2018. He was previously a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[2]\n\n\nKavanaugh studied history at Yale University, where he joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He then attended Yale Law School, after which he began his career as a law clerk working under Judge Ken Starr. After Starr left the D.C. Circuit to become the head of the Office of Independent Counsel, Kavanaugh assisted him with investigations concerning President Bill Clinton, including drafting the *Starr Report* recommending Clinton's impeachment. He joined the Bush administration as White House staff secretary and was a central figure in its efforts to identify and confirm judicial nominees.[3] Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2003. His confirmation hearings were contentious and stalled for three years over charges of partisanship. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit in May 2006.[2][4][5]\n\n\nPresident Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court on July 9, 2018, to fill the position vacated by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Later in July, Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in the early 1980s.[6][7][8] Three other women also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, one of whom later recanted her story.[9][10][11][12] None of the accusations were corroborated by eyewitness testimony, and Kavanaugh denied them. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a supplemental hearing over the allegations and voted 11–10 along party lines to advance the confirmation to a full Senate vote.[13] On October 6, the full Senate confirmed Kavanaugh by a vote of 50–48.[14][15]\n\n\nSince the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020, Kavanaugh has come to be regarded as a swing vote on the Court.[16][17] He was the target of an assassination attempt in June 2022; the suspect had hoped to disrupt the rulings in *Dobbs* and *Bruen*.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh was born on February 12, 1965, in Washington, D.C.,[19] the son of Martha Gamble (*née* Murphy) and Everett Edward Kavanaugh Jr.[20][21] He is of Irish Catholic descent on both sides of his family. His paternal great-grandfather immigrated to the United States from Roscommon, Ireland, in the late 19th century,[22][23] and his maternal Irish lineage goes back to his great-great-grandparents settling in New Jersey.[22] Kavanaugh's father was a lawyer and served as the president of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association for two decades.[24] His mother was a history teacher at Woodson and McKinley high schools in Washington in the 1960s and 1970s. She earned a Juris Doctor degree from American University in 1978 and served from 1995 to 2001 as a Maryland Circuit Court judge in Montgomery County, Maryland.[25][26]\n\n\nKavanaugh was raised in Bethesda, Maryland. As a teenager, he attended Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit boys' college prep school, where he was two years ahead of Neil Gorsuch, with whom he later clerked at the Supreme Court and eventually served with as a Supreme Court justice.[27][28] He was captain of the basketball team and was a wide receiver and cornerback on the football team.[29] Kavanaugh was also friends with classmate Mark Judge; both were in the same class with Maryland state senator Richard Madaleno.[30][31][32][33] In his yearbook Kavanaugh called himself a \"Renate Alumnius\", a reference to a female student at a nearby Catholic school.[34]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Georgetown Prep in 1983,[34] Kavanaugh went to Yale University, as had his paternal grandfather.[35][36] Several of Kavanaugh's Yale classmates remembered him as a \"serious but not showy student\" who loved sports, especially basketball.[37] He unsuccessfully tried out for the Yale Bulldogs men's basketball team and later played for two years on the junior varsity team.[37] He wrote articles about basketball and other sports for the *Yale Daily News*,[37] and was a member of the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon.[38][39] He graduated from Yale in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts *cum laude* in history.[37]\n\n\nKavanaugh then attended Yale Law School, where he lived in a group house with future judge James E. Boasberg and played basketball with professor George L. Priest (sponsor of the school's Federalist Society).[40] He was a member of the *Yale Law Journal* and served as a notes editor during his third year. Kavanaugh graduated from Yale Law with a Juris Doctor degree in 1990.[41]\n\n\n\n## Legal career (1990–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh (second from left) with President George W. Bush and White House staffers\n### Clerkships[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh served as a law clerk for Judge Walter King Stapleton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit from 1990 to 1991.[40] During his clerkship, Stapleton wrote the majority opinion in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, in which the Third Circuit upheld many of Pennsylvania's abortion restrictions.[40] Kavanaugh then clerked for Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1991 to 1992. Yale Law professor George Priest recommended Kavanaugh to Kozinski, who was regarded as a feeder judge.[40] Kavanaugh interviewed for a clerkship with Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1992 term, but was not offered a clerkship.[40]\n\n\nAfter working as a summer associate for the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, Kavanaugh earned a one-year fellowship with the Solicitor General of the United States, Ken Starr, from 1992 to 1993.[42][43][44] He then clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994,[42] alongside Neil Gorsuch and with future federal judge Gary Feinerman.[27]\n\n\n\n### Ken Starr associate counsel[edit]\n\n\nAfter his Supreme Court clerkship, Kavanaugh again worked for Ken Starr until 1997 as an Associate Counsel in the Office of the Independent Counsel with colleagues Rod Rosenstein and Alex Azar.[45] In that capacity, he reopened an investigation into the 1993 gunshot death of Vincent Foster.[45][46][47] After three years, the investigation concluded that Foster had committed suicide. In a September 2018 *New York Times* op-ed, Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz criticized Kavanaugh for having invested federal money and other resources into investigating partisan conspiracy theories surrounding the cause of Foster's death.[48]\n\n\nAfter working in private practice in 1997–98, Kavanaugh rejoined Starr as an Associate Counselor in 1998.[49] In *Swidler & Berlin v. United States* (1998), Kavanaugh argued his first and only case before the Supreme Court. Arguing for Starr's office, Kavanaugh asked the Court to disregard attorney–client privilege in relation to the investigation of Foster's death.[50] The court rejected Kavanaugh's arguments by a vote of 6–3.[51]\n\n\nKavanaugh was a principal author of the *Starr Report*, released in September 1998, on the Bill Clinton–Monica Lewinsky sex scandal; the report argued on broad grounds for Clinton's impeachment.[45] Kavanaugh had urged Starr to ask Clinton sexually graphic questions,[52][53] and described Clinton as being involved in \"a conspiracy to obstruct justice\", having \"disgraced his office\" and \"lied to the American people\".[54][55] The report provided extensive and explicit descriptions of each of Clinton's sexual encounters with Lewinsky, a level of detail the authors called \"essential\" to the case against Clinton.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh (blue shirt) with President Bush, Andy Card, and Condoleezza Rice\nIn December 2000, Kavanaugh joined the legal team of George W. Bush, which was trying to stop the ballot recount in Florida.[57] After Bush became president in January 2001, White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales hired Kavanaugh as an associate.[40] There, Kavanaugh worked on the Enron scandal, the successful nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts, and the unsuccessful nomination of Miguel Estrada to the Court of Appeals.[40] Starting in July 2003, he served as Assistant to the President and White House staff secretary,[43] succeeding Harriet Miers.[58] In that position he was responsible for coordinating all documents going to and from the president.\n\n\n\n### Private practice[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1997 to 1998, Kavanaugh was an associate at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Kavanaugh rejoined Kirkland & Ellis in 1999 and eventually became a partner.[49][43] While there in 2000, he was *pro bono* counsel of record for relatives of Elián González, a six-year-old rescued Cuban boy. After the boy's mother's death at sea, his relatives in the U.S. wanted to keep him from returning to the care of his sole surviving parent, his father in Cuba. Kavanaugh was among a series of lawyers who unsuccessfully sought to stop efforts to repatriate González to Cuba.[59] The district court, Circuit Court and Supreme Court all followed precedent, refusing to block the repatriation.[60]\n\n\nAlso at Kirkland & Ellis, Kavanaugh authored two amicus briefs to the Supreme Court that supported religious activities and expressions in public places.[60] The first, in *Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe* (2000), argued that a student speaker at football games voted for by a majority of students should be treated as private speech in a limited public forum; the second, in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School*, argued that a Christian Bible instruction program should have the same after-school access to school facilities as other non-curriculum-related student groups.[61]\n\n\n\n### Federalist Society[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh has been a member of the Federalist Society since 1988.[62][63] In the administration of George W. Bush, he held a key position that involved judicial appointments. Bush judicial nominees who were Federalist Society members included John Roberts and Samuel Alito, both appointed to the Supreme Court, and about half the judges appointed to the courts of appeals.[64]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Circuit Judge (2006–2018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh is sworn into the D.C. Circuit by Justice Anthony Kennedy as his wife holds the bible and President Bush looks on, 2006. Coincidentally, Kavanaugh would be sworn into the U.S. Supreme Court 12 years later as Kennedy's replacement.\nPresident George W. Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 25, 2003,[65] but his nomination stalled in the Senate for nearly three years. Democratic senators accused him of being too partisan, with Senator Dick Durbin calling him the \"Forrest Gump of Republican politics\".[66][67] In 2003, the American Bar Association had rated Kavanaugh \"well qualified\" (its highest category), but after doing dozens more interviews in 2006, downgraded him to \"qualified\".[68]\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee recommended he be confirmed on a 10–8 party-line vote on May 11, 2006,[69] and he was confirmed by the Senate on May 26 by a vote of 57–36.[70][71] Kavanaugh was sworn in on June 1.[72] He was the fourth judge nominated to the D.C. Circuit by Bush and confirmed. Kavanaugh began hearing cases on September 11 and had his formal investiture on September 27.[73]\n\n\nIn July 2007, senators Patrick Leahy and Dick Durbin accused Kavanaugh of lying to the Judiciary Committee when he denied being involved in formulating the Bush administration's detention and interrogation policies. In 2002, Kavanaugh had told other White House lawyers that he believed Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy would not approve of denying legal counsel to prisoners detained as enemy combatants.[74][75] The issue reemerged in July 2018 after Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court.[76]\n\n\n\n### Notable cases[edit]\n\n\nOn the 14 occasions on which Kavanaugh authored opinions that were considered by the Supreme Court, the Court adopted his position 13 times and reversed his position once. These included cases involving environmental regulations, criminal procedure, the separation of powers and extraterritorial jurisdiction in human rights abuse cases.[40][77] He was regarded as a feeder judge.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn the October 2017 decision *Garza v. Hargan*, Kavanaugh joined an unsigned, divided panel of the D.C. Circuit in holding that the Office of Refugee Resettlement does not violate an unaccompanied alien minor's constitutional right to an abortion by requiring that she first be appointed a sponsor before traveling to obtain the abortion, provided \"the process of securing a sponsor to whom the minor is released occurs expeditiously\".[79][80] Days later, the *en banc* D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment, with Kavanaugh dissenting.[80][81] In his dissent, he criticized the majority for creating \"a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand\".[82] The girl then obtained an abortion.[80] In 2018, in a follow-up petition from the Solicitor General of the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the *en banc* D.C. Circuit's judgment and the girl's claim was ultimately dismissed as moot and does not serve as precedent.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction in the case.[84][85] In his dissent, he compared the individual mandate to a tax. After a unanimous panel found that the ACA did not violate the Constitution's Origination Clause in *Sissel v. United States Department of Health & Human Services* (2014), Kavanaugh wrote a long dissent from the denial of rehearing *en banc*.[86][87] In May 2015, he dissented from a decision that denied an en banc rehearing of *Priests for Life v. HHS*, in which the panel upheld the ACA's contraceptive mandate accommodations against Priests for Life's Religious Freedom Restoration Act claims.[88][89] In *Zubik v. Burwell* (2016), the Supreme Court vacated the circuit's judgment in a per curiam decision.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Appointments Clause and separation of powers[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2008, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit found that the Constitution's Appointments Clause did not prevent the Sarbanes–Oxley Act from creating a board whose members were not directly removable by the president.[91][92] In *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board* (2010), the Supreme Court reversed the circuit court's judgment by a vote of 5–4.[93]\n\n\nIn 2015, Kavanaugh found that those directly regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could challenge the constitutionality of its design.[94][95] In October 2016, he wrote for a divided panel finding that the CFPB's design was unconstitutional, and made the CFPB director removable by the president of the United States.[96][97] In January 2018, the *en banc* D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment by a vote of 7–3, over Kavanaugh's dissent.[98][99]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Kavanaugh issued an extraordinary writ of *mandamus* requiring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to process the license application of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, over the dissent of Judge Merrick Garland.[100][101] In April 2014, Kavanaugh dissented when the court found that Labor Secretary Tom Perez could issue workplace safety citations against SeaWorld regarding the multiple killings of its workers by Tilikum, an orca.[102][103]\n\n\nAfter Kavanaugh wrote for a divided panel striking down a Clean Air Act regulation, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 6–2 in *EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P.* (2014).[104][105] Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing *en banc* of a unanimous panel opinion upholding the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5–4 in *Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency* (2014).[106][107] After Kavanaugh dissented from a *per curiam* decision allowing the agency to disregard cost–benefit analysis, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5–4 in *Michigan v. EPA* (2015).[108][109]\n\n\n\n#### Extraterritorial jurisdiction[edit]\n\n\nIn *Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp.* (2007), Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court allowed a lawsuit making accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in Indonesia to proceed, arguing that the claims were not justiciable.[110][111] He dissented again when the circuit court later found that the corporation could be sued under the Alien Tort Statute of 1789.[77][112][113]\n\n\n\n#### First Amendment and free speech[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh wrote for unanimous three-judge district courts when they held that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act could restrict soft money donations to political parties and forbid campaign contributions by foreign citizens.[114][115] The Supreme Court summarily affirmed both those judgments on direct appeal.[116]\n\n\nIn 2014, Kavanaugh concurred in the judgment when the *en banc* D.C. Circuit found that the Free Speech Clause did not forbid the government from requiring meatpackers to include a country of origin label on their products.[117][118] In *United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC* (2016), he dissented when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear a rejected challenge to the net neutrality rule, writing, \"Congress did not clearly authorize the FCC to issue the net neutrality rule.\"[43][119][120]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment and civil liberties[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2010, Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing *en banc* after the circuit found that attaching a Global Positioning System tracking device to a vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.[121][122] The Supreme Court then affirmed the circuit's judgment in *United States v. Jones* (2012).[123] In February 2016, Kavanaugh dissented when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear police officers' rejected claims of qualified immunity for arresting partygoers in a vacant house.[43][124] The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the circuit's judgment in *District of Columbia v. Wesby* (2018).[125]\n\n\nIn *Klayman v. Obama* (2015), Kavanaugh concurred when the circuit court denied an *en banc* rehearing of its decision to vacate a district court order blocking the National Security Agency's warrantless bulk collection of telephony metadata,[126][127] writing that the metadata collection was not a search, and even if it were, no reasonable suspicion would be required because of the government's special need to prevent terrorist attacks.[128]\n\n\n\n#### National security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh holds his daughter while greeting British Prime Minister Tony Blair and President George W. Bush.\nIn April 2009, Kavanaugh wrote a long concurrence when the court found that detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp had no right to advance notice before being transferred to another country.[129][130] In *Kiyemba v. Obama* (2010), the Supreme Court vacated that judgment while refusing to review the matter.[131] In June 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a concurrence in judgment when the *en banc* D.C. Circuit found that the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory owners could not bring a defamation suit regarding the government's allegations that they were terrorists.[132][133] In October 2012, he wrote for a unanimous court when it found that the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause made it unlawful for the government to prosecute Salim Hamdan under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 on charges of providing material support for terrorism.[134][135]\n\n\nIn August 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a lengthy concurrence when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear Ghaleb Nassar Al Bihani's rejected claims that the international law of war limits the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.[43][136] In 2014, he concurred in the judgment when the *en banc* circuit found that Ali al-Bahlul could be retroactively convicted of war crimes, provided the existing statute already made it a crime \"because it does not alter the definition of the crime, the defenses or the punishment\".[137][138] In October 2016, Kavanaugh wrote the plurality opinion when the *en banc* circuit found al-Bahlul could be convicted by a military commission even if his offenses are not internationally recognized as war crimes.[139][140]\n\n\nIn *Meshal v. Higgenbotham* (2016), Kavanaugh concurred when the divided panel threw out a claim by an American that he had been disappeared by the FBI in a Kenyan black site.[141][142]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment and gun ownership[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court found that a ban on the sale of semi-automatic rifles was permissible under the Second Amendment. This case followed the landmark Supreme Court ruling *District of Columbia v. Heller* (2008).[143][144]\n\n\n\n#### Vaccine regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Kavanaugh wrote the opinion in *Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs v. Sebelius*,[145] holding that opponents of thimerosal-preserved vaccines lacked standing to challenge determinations by the Food and Drug Administration that vaccines and their components are safe and effective. SCOTUSblog provided the case as an example of the fact that \"[e]ven when Kavanaugh rejects a claim, he sometimes uses his discussion of standing to show that he has heard the plaintiff's argument and taken it seriously\".[146] Bloomberg wrote, \"Kavanaugh's opinion for the court repeatedly went out of its way to show it respected the Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs's (CoMeD) 'genuine concern' regarding thimerosal\", but nevertheless \"said the coalition was required to seek a ban through the executive or legislative branches\".[147]\n\n\n\n### Law clerk hiring practices[edit]\n\n\nTwenty-five of Kavanaugh's 48 law clerks have been women, and 13 people of color.[148] Some have been children of other judges and high-profile legal figures, including Clayton Kozinski (son of former federal Judge Alex Kozinski), Porter Wilkinson (daughter of Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III), Philip Alito (son of Justice Samuel Alito), Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld (daughter of Yale Law professors Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld), and Emily Chertoff (daughter of former DHS secretary Michael Chertoff).[149][150]\n\n\nOn September 20, 2018, *The Guardian* reported that two Yale professors had advised female law students at Yale that their physical appearance and femininity could play a role in securing a clerkship with Kavanaugh. Rubenfeld said that Kavanaugh \"hires women with a certain look\" but did not say what that \"look\" was.[151] Unnamed sources reported that Chua said that female applicants should exude \"model-like\" femininity and \"dress outgoing\" in job interviews with Kavanaugh. Responding to the report, Chua denied that Kavanaugh's hiring decisions were affected by female applicants' attractiveness, saying, \"Judge Kavanaugh's first and only litmus test in hiring has been excellence.\"[151] Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken announced an investigation of the matter,[152] but Yale did not find any cause for sanction. Chua returned to regular teaching in 2019.[153]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh and his family with President Donald Trump on July 9, 2018\nOn July 2, 2018, Kavanaugh was one of four U.S. Court of Appeals judges to receive a personal 45-minute interview by President Donald Trump as a potential replacement for Justice Anthony Kennedy.[154] On July 9, Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.[155][156] In his first public speech after the nomination, Kavanaugh said, \"No president has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.\"[157]\n\n\n\n### Legal philosophy and approach[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on |\n| Conservatismin the United States |\n| ![](image) |\n| Schools\n* Compassionate\n* Fiscal\n* Fusion\n* Libertarian\n* Moderate\n* Movement\n* Neo\n* Paleo\n* Progressive\n* Social\n* Traditionalist\n |\n| Principles\n* American exceptionalism\n* Anti-communism\n* Christian nationalism\n* Classical liberalism\n* Constitutionalism\n* Familialism\n* Family values\n* Federalism\n\t+ States' rights\n* Judeo-Christian values\n* Individualism\n* Law and order\n* Limited government\n* Militarism\n* Moral absolutism\n* Natural law\n* Patriotism\n* Republicanism\n* Right to bear arms\n* Rule of law\n* Tradition\n |\n| History\n* Conservative coalition\n* Conservative Democrat\n* Conservative Manifesto\n* Loyalists\n* McCarthyism\n* Modern timeline\n* New Right\n* Old Right\n* Overview\n* Reagan Doctrine\n* Reaganomics\n* Stalwart Republicans\n* Southern Agrarians\n |\n| Intellectuals\n* Anton\n* Babbitt\n* Bell\n* Bellow\n* Bloom\n* Boorstin\n* Buckley\n* Burnham\n* Chambers\n* Conquest\n* Derbyshire\n* Dolan\n* Durant\n* Eastman\n* Eliot\n* Francis\n* George\n* Goldberg\n* Gottfried\n* Hanson\n* Hazony\n* Hoppe\n* Jaffa\n* Kimball\n* Kirk\n* Kirkpatrick\n* Kreeft\n* Kristol (Irving)\n* Kuehnelt-Leddihn\n* Laffer\n* Lasch\n* Lovecraft\n* Lukacs\n* Mansfield\n* Mencken\n* Meyer\n* Molnar\n* Murray\n* Nisbet\n* Nock\n* O'Connor\n* Ong\n* Ransom\n* Repplier\n* Santayana\n* Sowell\n* Strauss\n* Sumner\n* Viereck\n* Voegelin\n* Washington\n* Weaver\n* Yarvin\n |\n| Politicians\n* Abbott\n* Adams\n* Quincy Adams\n* Agnew\n* Buchanan\n* Bush (George H.

Wade*, which ruled abortion bans unconstitutional, and *Furman v. Georgia*, which ruled all existing death penalty statutes unconstitutional.[160][161] Two law professors evaluated Kavanaugh's appellate court decisions for the *Washington Post,* rating his decisions in four areas: rights of criminal defendants; support for rules regarding stricter enforcement of environmental protection; upholding the rights of labor unions; and siding with those bringing suits alleging discrimination. They found he had the most conservative voting record on the D.C. Circuit in three of those policy areas, and the second-most in the fourth, between 2003 and 2018.[162]\n\n\nDuring his hearing, Kavanaugh said that he had often said the four greatest moments in Supreme Court history were *Brown v. Board of Education*, *Marbury v. Madison*, *Youngstown Steel*, and *United States v. Nixon*, with *Brown* the single greatest.[163]\n\n\nAccording to the Judicial Common Space scores, a score based on the ideology scores of the home state senators and the president who nominated the judge to the federal bench, Clarence Thomas was the only justice more conservative than Kavanaugh. By this metric, Kavanaugh's confirmation shifted the court to the right.[164] Had Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland been confirmed in 2016, Stephen Breyer would have become the median swing vote when Kennedy retired. However, since Antonin Scalia was replaced by another conservative (Gorsuch), it was expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would become the median swing vote on the Supreme Court upon Kavanaugh's confirmation.[165]\n\n\n\n### Senate Judiciary Committee public hearings[edit]\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled three or four days of public hearings on Kavanaugh's nomination, commencing on September 4, 2018. The hearings were delayed at the onset by objections from the Democratic members about the absence of records of Kavanaugh's time in the George W. Bush administration. The Democrats also complained that 42,000 pages of documents had been received only the night before the first day of hearings.[166] Republicans asserted that the volume of documents available on Kavanaugh equaled that of the previous five nominees to the court; the Democrats responded that only 15% of the documents they had requested about Kavanaugh had been provided. Numerous motions by the Democrats to adjourn or suspend the hearings were ruled out of order by Chairman Chuck Grassley, who argued that Kavanaugh had written over 300 legal opinions available for review. The first day's session closed after statements from each senator and the nominee, with question-and-answer periods to begin the next day.[167]\n\n\nDuring the first round of questions from senators on September 5, 2018, Kavanaugh held to his earlier stated position that he would not express an opinion on matters that might come before the Court. He thus refused to promise to recuse himself from any case, including any that might involve Trump. He also declined to comment on coverage of preexisting healthcare conditions, semiautomatic rifle possession, *Roe v. Wade*, or the president's power to self-pardon. He expounded at length on various Constitutional amendments, stare decisis (the role of legal precedent in shaping subsequent judicial rulings), and the president's power to dismiss federal employees. As in the previous session, there were frequent outbursts of protest in the audience, requiring security intervention and removal, as well as repeated procedural objections by Democrats.[168]\n\n\nThe committee's third day of hearings began with a furor over the release of emails by Kavanaugh related to concern about potential racial profiling in security screenings. The day continued with Kavanaugh's attempts to articulate his jurisprudence, including refusing to answer direct questions about matters he called hypothetical.[169] Senator Chris Coons had tendered Kavanaugh written questions about any knowledge of inappropriate behavior on the part of judge Alex Kozinski, for whom Kavanaugh had clerked, including his circulations of sexually explicit emails via his \"Easy Rider Gag List\". According to *The Intercept*, though Coons had asked him to review his emails from Kozinski, Kavanaugh replied, \"I do not remember\".[170] During his testimony, Kavanaugh said that Kozinski's 2017 exposure as an alleged prolific sexual harasser was a surprising \"gut punch\". *The Guardian* reported that their sources disputed Kavanaugh's account because Kozinski's alleged behavior was reportedly widely known among those in the judicial system and its exposure culminated in his abrupt resignation from the bench.[171]\n\n\n\nThe committee released a 2003 email in which Kavanaugh said, \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to [*Roe v. Wade*] as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current justices on the Court would do so.\"[172] Kavanaugh stressed that he was commenting on the views of legal scholars at the time, not his own views, and noted that the case had been reaffirmed on a number of occasions since 2003.[173] Senator Susan Collins indicated that Kavanaugh's statement did not contradict his personal assurance to her that *Roe* is settled law.[174] Kavanaugh noted that *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992), which reaffirmed *Roe v. Wade*, was \"precedent on precedent\". According to Kavanaugh, *Casey* is a key decision about when the Court's precedent may be overturned.[175]\n\n\nOn September 27, the committee held an additional day of public hearings to discuss allegations that Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct while in high school. The only witnesses were Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, his accuser.[176] Republican members of the committee did not question Ford directly; questioning on their behalf was done by Rachel Mitchell, a career prosecutor from Maricopa County, Arizona.[177] Grassley cut her questioning short, after which the Republican members of the committee questioned him themselves.[178][179] Alternating with their questions, Democratic members of the committee questioned Ford and Kavanaugh.[180] Ford repeated and expanded upon her earlier allegations, saying that Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge, both \"visibly drunk\", had locked her into a bedroom, where Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take off her clothes while Judge watched. She said she \"believed he was going to rape me\" and feared for her life when he held his hand over her mouth. In his opening statement, Kavanaugh claimed the accusations were a \"political hit\" by left-wing activists and Democrats, saying he faced retaliation \"on behalf of the Clintons\" for his work on the Starr Report against Bill Clinton.[181][182][183] Leland Keyser, Ford's friend who Ford said was present during the alleged attack, has denied that it took place, and questioned certain aspects of the story. Keyser also stated she felt pressured by people to support Ford's story, something she told the FBI about.[184] In response to his testimony, more than 2,400 law professors signed a letter saying that the Senate should not confirm him because \"he did not display the impartiality and judicial temperament requisite to sit on the highest court of our land.\"[185]\n\n\n\n### Sexual assault allegations[edit]\n\n\n#### Christine Blasey Ford[edit]\n\n\nIn early July 2018, Kavanaugh's name was on a shortlist of nominees for the Supreme Court. Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, contacted a *Washington Post* tipline and her U.S. Representative, Anna Eshoo, with accusations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were in high school.[7][186] On July 30, 2018, Ford wrote to Senator Dianne Feinstein to inform her of her accusation against Kavanaugh,[187] requesting that it be kept confidential.[188] After a September 12 report in *The Intercept*,[7][186][189] Feinstein confirmed that a complaint had been made against Kavanaugh by a woman who had requested not to be identified. Feinstein said that the woman had claimed that, when they were both in high school, Kavanaugh had tried to force himself on her while she was being physically restrained.[190][191] The same day, Feinstein said she had forwarded the woman's accusation to federal authorities.[192][193]\n\n\nOn September 16, Ford publicized her allegations and claimed Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when she was 15 and he was 17.[194][195] She said that in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, one of Kavanaugh's friends from Georgetown Prep, corralled her in a bedroom at a house party in Maryland and turned up the music playing in the room. According to Ford, Kavanaugh pinned her to the bed, groped her, ground against her, tried to pull off her clothes, and covered her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream.[196] Ford said she was afraid that Kavanaugh might inadvertently kill her during the attack,[197] and believed he was going to rape her.[198] Ford stated that she escaped when Judge jumped on the bed, knocking them all to the floor.[194][199]\n\n\nKavanaugh issued the following statement through the White House: \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\"[193][192] Republicans criticized the decision to withhold \"a vague, anonymous accusation for months\" before releasing it on the \"eve of [Kavanaugh's] confirmation\" as an attempt to delay his confirmation hearings.[200][201] Kavanaugh released a statement on the evening before his and Ford's scheduled testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said that due to the serious nature of the allegations, both he and Ford deserved to be heard. He also stated, \"I am innocent of this charge.\"[202]\n\n\nOn September 19, the Senate Judiciary Committee invited Kavanaugh and Ford to testify about the allegation. Kavanaugh agreed to testify on September 19.[203] Ford requested that the FBI investigate the matter first, but Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley declined the request, and gave Ford a deadline of September 21 to inform the committee whether she intended to testify. He added that Ford was welcome to appear before the committee privately or publicly.[204] On September 20, Ford's attorney opened negotiations with the committee to reschedule the hearing under \"terms that are fair and which ensure her safety\".[205] A bipartisan Judiciary Committee panel and Ford's representatives agreed to a hearing after September 24.[206]\n\n\nFord stated that Leland Ingham Keyser, a lifelong friend, was present at the party where the alleged assault took place. On September 22, Keyser stated through her attorney that she did not know Kavanaugh and had no memory of the party or a sexual assault. The attorney did confirm that Keyser was a friend of Ford's,[207] and Keyser told *The Washington Post* that she believed Ford's allegation.[208][209]\n\n\nOn October 4, 2018, the White House announced that it had found no corroboration of Ford's allegation after reviewing the FBI's latest probe into Kavanaugh's past.[210] Her attorneys tweeted, \"Those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth.\"[211]\n\n\nIn September 2019, *New York Times* reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin published *The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation*. They reported that Keyser \"thought the whole setup Ford described ... sounded wrong\", and that she \"challenged Ford's accuracy\", quoting Keyser as saying, \"I don't have any confidence in the story\".[212] According to *The Washington Post*, the book revealed that \"Keyser also said she spoke with many people who 'wanted me to remember something different'—suggesting that there was pressure on her to toe the line [against Kavanaugh]\".[213]\n\n\n\n#### Deborah Ramirez[edit]\n\n\nOn September 23, 2018, Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer of *The New Yorker* published an article with another sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh. Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale University with Kavanaugh, alleged he exposed himself to her and thrust his penis against her face after they had both been drinking at a college party during the 1983–84 academic year. Kavanaugh said, \"This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen.\"[214] *The New Yorker* spoke to four classmates, three identified as eyewitnesses but all denied witnessing the event.[214] *The New York Times* interviewed several dozen of Ramirez's classmates in an attempt to corroborate her story, and could find no firsthand witnesses to the alleged assault, but several classmates recalled that they had heard about it in the subsequent days and believed Ramirez.[215] According to *The New York Times*, \"Ramirez herself told the press and friends that, initially, she was not absolutely certain it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her, but after corresponding with friends who had secondhand knowledge of the incident, and taking time to refresh her recollection, stated that she was certain Kavanaugh was her assailant.\"[216] *The Washington Post* analyzed Ramirez's allegation and concluded, \"Ramirez's accusation has the dual distinction of having more potential corroboration and less actual corroboration than Ford's\".[217]\n\n\n\n#### Julie Swetnick[edit]\n\n\nAttorney Michael Avenatti tweeted on September 23, 2018, that he represented a woman who had \"credible information\" about Kavanaugh and Judge. Avenatti said his client would be willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[218][219][220] On September 26, Avenatti revealed the woman to be Julie Swetnick, a former government employee. In a sworn statement, Swetnick described attending \"well over ten house parties in the Washington, D.C. area during the years 1981–1983 where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present\". She described witnessing efforts by Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh to cause girls to become inebriated so they could be gang raped. Kavanaugh called her allegations \"ridiculous\" and Avenatti's allegation as a whole a \"farce\".[10] *The Wall Street Journal* reported that it had contacted \"dozens\" of her former classmates and colleagues but failed to reach anyone with knowledge of her allegations and that none of her friends had come forward publicly to support her claims.[221] In an interview with NBC News, Swetnick clarified that she did not personally witness Kavanaugh or Judge spike any drinks, and accused Avenatti of twisting her words. She further clarified that she did not personally witness efforts by Kavanaugh or Judge to cause girls to become inebriated so they could be gang raped. Swetnick provided NBC News with the names of friends who attended the parties, but none could corroborate her claims, while some said they did not know her.[222][223] Grassley referred Swetnick and Avenatti to the Justice Department for criminal investigation regarding claims that they engaged in \"conspiracy, false statements and obstruction of Congress\".[224]\n\n\n\n#### Judy Munro-Leighton[edit]\n\n\nOn September 19, Judy Munro-Leighton accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in an anonymous letter signed \"Jane Doe\", which was addressed to Grassley but mailed to Senator Kamala Harris. On September 26, the Senate committee interrogated Kavanaugh about this accusation. Kavanaugh called the accusation \"ridiculous\".[11] On November 1, Munro-Leighton talked to committee staff members. During the conversation she changed her story, denying that she had penned the anonymous letter and saying she had contacted Congress as \"a ploy\" to \"get attention\".[225] On November 2, Grassley announced Munro-Leighton's identity, and described her accusations as fabricated.[11] She was referred to the Department of Justice and FBI for making false accusations and obstructing justice.[11]\n\n\n\n#### FBI investigation and ethics complaints[edit]\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Republican leadership of the committee indicated that they planned to hold a committee vote on the nomination the next day, September 28, with a procedural vote on the Senate floor on September 29.[226] On September 28, the committee voted along party lines to advance the nomination to the full Senate; Senator Jeff Flake's vote in support was conditioned on delaying the vote in the full Senate for a week to allow the FBI to investigate Ford's claims. Later, Senators Joe Manchin and Lisa Murkowski also said they would not vote to confirm without an FBI investigation.[227] On this request from the Judiciary Committee, Trump ordered a \"supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh's file\", to be limited in scope and completed within a week.[228] The report was transmitted to the White House on October 3 and from there to the Senate on October 4, where senators were permitted to review the report one at a time in secrecy. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote on the confirmation on October 6.[229] Democrats called the FBI investigation incomplete, a \"farce\", a \"sham\" and \"a horrific cover-up\" that omitted key witnesses at the White House's direction.[230][231] According to *The Washington Post*, the White House stopped the FBI from investigating possible falsehoods in Kavanaugh's testimony to Congress about his drinking habits during his youth.[211]\n\n\nEighty-three ethics complaints were brought against Kavanaugh regarding his conduct during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Chief Justice Roberts appointed a special federal panel of judges to investigate them. In December 2018, the panel dismissed all the complaints, calling them \"serious\" but deciding that lower court judges have no authority to investigate Supreme Court justices.[232]\n\n\n\n#### 2023 *Justice* film[edit]\n\n\nDoug Liman's 2023 documentary *Justice* recounts the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, including the testimony of Ford and Ramirez. It features a never-before-heard audio recording made by Partnership for Public Service president and CEO Max Stier, a Yale colleague of Kavanaugh's, that corroborates Ramirez's charges and suggests that Kavanaugh violated another unnamed woman. Stier says that he witnessed Kavanaugh with his pants down with a group of rowdy soccer players forcing a drunk female freshman to hold Kavanaugh's penis. Stier also says that he had heard from classmates about Ramirez's similar encounter with Kavanaugh, which she personally describes in the film.[233]\n\n\nThe documentary also highlights the narratives Kavanaugh advanced to sway public opinion and gain Republicans' support, which reviewers described as misleading. Reviewers were persuaded that Kavanaugh and his team were aware of Ford's and Ramirez's charges before they became public and preemptively countered them by planting alternate narratives with friends and acquaintances.[234][235]\n\n\n\n### Senate action[edit]\n\n\nOn October 5, the Senate voted 51–49 to invoke cloture, advancing the nomination to a final floor vote expected on October 6. This was enabled through the application of the so-called \"nuclear option\", or a simple majority vote, rather than the historical three-fifths supermajority in place before April 2017.[236] The vote was along party lines, with the exception of Democrat Joe Manchin voting yes and Republican Lisa Murkowski voting no.[237][238]\n\n\nOn October 6, the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court by a 50–48 vote.[239] One senator, Republican Steve Daines, who supported the nomination, was absent during the vote due to his attendance at his daughter's wedding that day, and Murkowski voted \"present\" despite her opposition so that their votes would cancel out and the balance of the vote would be retained—a rarely used traditional courtesy known as a \"pair between senators\".[240] All Republicans except Daines and Murkowski voted to confirm Kavanaugh, and all Democrats except Joe Manchin voted not to.[241] Kavanaugh's confirmation vote was historically close. The only Supreme Court confirmation that was closer was the vote on Stanley Matthews, nominated by President James A. Garfield in 1881. Matthews was confirmed by a single vote, 24–23; no other justice has been confirmed by a single vote.[242][243][244] In *percentage* terms, Kavanaugh's vote was even closer than Matthews's. Matthews received 51.06% of the vote to Kavanaugh's 51.02%.[245]\n\n\n\n### Swearing-in[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh was sworn in as the 114th justice of the Supreme Court on the evening of October 6, 2018.[246] The Constitutional Oath was administered by Chief Justice Roberts and the Judicial Oath was administered by Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh succeeded on the Court. This private ceremony was followed by a public ceremony at the White House on October 8.[15][247][248] Upon joining the Court, Kavanaugh became the first Supreme Court justice to hire an all-female team of law clerks.[249][250]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2018–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh being sworn in to succeed Anthony Kennedy as an associate justice on October 8, 2018\nKavanaugh began his tenure as Supreme Court justice on October 9, 2018, hearing arguments for *Stokeling v. United States* and *United States v. Stitt*.[251]\n\n\n\n### Circuit assignment[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Kavanaugh was reassigned to both the Sixth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit.[252] He had previously been assigned to the Seventh Circuit, which covers federal courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.[253] Circuit justices are principally responsible for responding to emergency requests (for example, applications for emergency stays of executions)[254] that arise from the circuit's jurisdiction, either by the assigned justice alone or else by the justice's referring them to the full Court for review.\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh wrote his first Supreme Court opinion on January 8, 2019, in *Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc.*, a unanimous decision reversing an appeals court opinion that had allowed a court to decide whether an issue in a contract between a dental equipment manufacturer and distributor should be decided by arbitration.[255]\n\n\nOn February 27, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the court's liberal justices in *Garza v. Idaho*, a case in which the Court held that the Sixth Amendment's presumption of prejudice resulting from ineffective assistance of counsel applies to situations in which an attorney declines to file an appeal because an appeal waiver was signed as part of a plea agreement.[256]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, as a swing vote, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the Court's four more liberal justices to decline to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas, which sought to block women from choosing to receive Medicaid-funded medical care from Planned Parenthood clinics. Two lower appeals courts had ruled that the federal law creating Medicaid protects patients' rights to choose any provider which is \"qualified to perform\" the needed services.[257]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Kavanaugh joined three of his conservative colleagues in voting to reject a stay of a Louisiana law to restrict abortion.[258] He issued his own dissenting opinion.[259] *CNBC* reported that \"Kavanaugh agreed [with three conservative justices], but wrote separately that he would be open to reconsidering the legality of the law if the dire warnings from abortion rights groups materialized.\"[260] The Supreme Court decided this case, *June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo*, on June 29, 2020, striking down Louisiana's requirement for abortion providers to hold hospital admitting privileges. Kavanaugh dissented.[261] In September 2021, by a 5–4 vote, the Court declined an emergency petition to temporarily block enforcement of the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans nearly all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Kavanaugh was in the majority, joined by Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Barrett.[262] In June 2022, in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, Kavanaugh joined the same four justices in voting to completely overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[263]\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nAlso in February, Kavanaugh was part of the majority in decisions relating to the death penalty. On February 7, 2019, he was part of the majority in a 5–4 decision rejecting a Muslim prisoner's request to delay his execution in order to have an imam present.[264] On February 19, 2019, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the Court's four liberal justices in a 6–3 decision blocking the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.[265][266] In January 2022, he voted with the majority in a 5–4 decision to allow an execution to proceed in Alabama.[267] In 2023 Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion in *Reed v. Goertz*, ruling that Texas death row inmate Rodney Reed could seek DNA testing on evidence in his case despite the state's statute of limitations on such testing.[268]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2020, in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, the Supreme Court ruled 6–3 that the workplace nondiscrimination protections in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should be interpreted as protecting people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Kavanaugh wrote a dissent in which he argued that sexual orientation discrimination has always been understood as distinct from sex discrimination. He conceded that sexual orientation discrimination \"may, as a very literal matter, entail making a distinction based on sex\"; nonetheless, he said, \"to fire one employee because she is a woman and another employee because he is gay implicates two distinct societal concerns, reveals two distinct biases, imposes two distinct harms, and falls within two distinct statutory prohibitions.\" He said that any change to the relevant law ought to be made by Congress, not by judges; and that \"both the rule of law and democratic accountability badly suffer when a court adopts a hidden or obscure interpretation of the law, and not its ordinary meaning.\"[269] Kavanaugh's dissent did not discuss gender identity or use the word \"transgender\", although transgender rights were at issue in the case. In a footnote, he wrote that his analysis \"on the basis of sexual orientation would apply in much the same way to discrimination on the basis of gender identity.\"[270] In October 2020, Kavanaugh agreed with the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to deny an appeal brought by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[271]\n\n\nIn 2021, Kavanaugh joined the majority opinion in *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*, ruling in favor of a Catholic adoption and social service agency that had been denied funding by the City of Philadelphia because it does not place children for adoption with same-sex couples; the ruling also declined to overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices\".[272] The same month, Kavanaugh was among the six justices who rejected the appeal of a Washington State florist, whom lower courts had ruled violated non-discrimination laws by refusing to sell floral arrangements to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage, leaving the lower courts' judgments in place.[273][274][275] In November 2021, Kavanaugh voted with the majority of justices in a 6–3 decision to decline to hear an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[276] Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented; because four votes are required to hear an appeal, the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[277][278]\n\n\n\n### President Trump's taxes[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2020, in *Trump v. Vance*, the Supreme Court ruled in two 7–2 decisions that the Manhattan District Attorney could access Trump's tax records, but that the issue of whether Congress could access the same records needed to be processed through the lower courts. Kavanaugh joined Roberts, Gorsuch, and the court's four Democratic appointees in the majority;[279] Justices Thomas and Alito dissented.[280] The rulings mean that the Manhattan DA will have access to the records while Congress does not, pending the outcome of the case in lower courts.[281]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nEight days before the 2020 presidential election Kavanaugh concurred that absentee votes properly cast in Wisconsin but received after November 3 must be discarded, joining the Court's conservatives in a ruling that requires deferral to state officials on elections.[282][283] On October 19, Kavanaugh voted to grant a request for a stay that would have prevented ballots sent before Election Day but delivered within three days after it from being counted. The Court was split 4–4, so the ruling by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania requiring all votes to be counted stood, but the case may be reheard.[284] Kavanaugh sided with Roberts and three liberal justices in a 5-3 majority to allow voting extension in North Carolina.[285]\n\n\n\n### Compensation of college athletes[edit]\n\n\nIn his concurrence in *National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston* in June 2021, in which the Court ruled unanimously that college sports were not exempt from antitrust law, Kavanaugh called the NCAA \"a massive money-raising enterprise on the backs of student athletes who are not fairly compensated.\" No one else, he said, could \"not ... pay workers a fair market rate on the theory that their product is defined by not paying their workers a fair market rate.\" He said there were \"serious questions\" about other rules on compensation.[286]\n\n\n\n### Attempted assassination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brett Kavanaugh assassination plot\n\nIn the early morning of June 8, 2022, Nicholas John Roske traveled from California to Kavanaugh's home in Maryland with plans to break into the home, murder Kavanaugh, and commit suicide.[18][287] After seeing two U.S. Marshals outside Kavanaugh's home, Roske turned himself in by calling 9-1-1. He said his attempt to murder Kavanaugh stemmed from dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court's leaked draft opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, as well as the potential for the Court to loosen gun control laws under the Second Amendment. Roske was armed with a pistol, two magazines and ammunition, pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, a screwdriver, a nail punch, a crowbar, a pistol light, duct tape, and other items. He has been charged with attempted murder.[18]\n\n\n\n## Teaching and scholarship[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh taught full-term courses on separation of powers at Harvard Law School from 2008 to 2015, on the Supreme Court at Harvard Law School between 2014 and 2018, on National Security and Foreign Relations Law at Yale Law School in 2011, and on Constitutional Interpretation at Georgetown University Law Center in 2007. He was named the Samuel Williston Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School in 2009.[288] In 2008, Kavanaugh was hired as a visiting professor by Elena Kagan, then the dean of Harvard Law School. According to *The Boston Globe*, he was generous with his time and accessible, and quickly became a student favorite. He often dined in Cambridge with students and offered references and career advice.[289][290] Kavanaugh received high evaluations from his students, including J. D. Vance.[291] After the allegations of sexual misconduct against him, Harvard Law School graduates[*which?*] petitioned Harvard to rescind Kavanaugh's position as a lecturer.[*citation needed*] Shortly thereafter, Kavanaugh voluntarily withdrew from teaching at Harvard for the 2019 winter semester.[292] In the summer of 2019, he joined the faculty of George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School as a visiting professor, co-teaching a summer course in Runnymede, England, on the origins and creation of the United States Constitution.[293]\n\n\nIn 2009, Kavanaugh wrote an article for the *Minnesota Law Review* in which he argued that Congress should exempt U.S. presidents from civil lawsuits while in office[294] because, among other things, such lawsuits could be \"time-consuming and distracting\" for the president and would thus \"ill serve the public interest, especially in times of financial or national security crisis\".[295] Kavanaugh argued that if a president \"does something dastardly\", they may be impeached by the House of Representatives, convicted by the Senate, and criminally prosecuted after leaving office.[294] He asserted that the U.S. would have been better off if President Clinton could have \"focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots\".[294] This article garnered attention in 2018 when Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court by Trump, whose 2016 presidential campaign was at the time the subject of a federal probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.[295]\n\n\nWhen reviewing a book on statutory interpretation by Second Circuit Chief Judge Robert Katzmann, Kavanaugh observed that judges often cannot agree on a statute if its text is ambiguous.[296] To remedy this, he encouraged judges to first seek the \"best reading\" of the statute, through \"interpreting the words of the statute\" as well as the context of the statute as a whole, and only then apply other interpretive techniques that may justify an interpretation that differs from the \"best meaning\", such as constitutional avoidance, legislative history, and Chevron deference.[296]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Kavanaugh family with President Bush\nKavanaugh and Ashley Estes, the personal secretary to former President George W. Bush,[297] married in 2004; the couple have two daughters.[298] They live in Chevy Chase Section Five, Maryland.[40]\n\n\nKavanaugh ran the Boston Marathon in 2010 and 2015.[299] His bibs bore non-qualifying numbers, assigned for a charity or a \"guest\" rather than an age-based time qualifier.[300] He also has completed many shorter races, from 5 km to 10 miles.[301][302]\n\n\nKavanaugh is a Roman Catholic[297] and serves as a regular lector at the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament at Hanceville, Alabama. He has helped serve meals to the homeless as part of church programs, and has tutored at the Washington Jesuit Academy, a Catholic private school in the District of Columbia.[297][303]\n\n\nAt his May 2006 confirmation hearing to the District of Columbia Circuit, he stated that he was a registered Republican.[1] In 2018, Kavanaugh's reported salary was $220,600 as a federal judge and $27,000 as a lecturer at Harvard Law School.[304]\n\n\nIn 2022, Kavanaugh's home was the site of protests following the leak of a draft majority opinion for the Supreme Court case *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.*[305][306]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* Kavanaugh, Brett (1989). \"Note: Defense Presence and Participation: A Procedural Minimum for Batson v.

He was nominated by President Donald Trump on July 9, 2018, and has served since October 6, 2018. He was previously a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[2]\n\n\nKavanaugh studied history at Yale University, where he joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He then attended Yale Law School, after which he began his career as a law clerk working under Judge Ken Starr. After Starr left the D.C. Circuit to become the head of the Office of Independent Counsel, Kavanaugh assisted him with investigations concerning President Bill Clinton, including drafting the *Starr Report* recommending Clinton's impeachment. He joined the Bush administration as White House staff secretary and was a central figure in its efforts to identify and confirm judicial nominees.[3] Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2003. His confirmation hearings were contentious and stalled for three years over charges of partisanship. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit in May 2006.[2][4][5]\n\n\nPresident Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court on July 9, 2018, to fill the position vacated by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Later in July, Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in the early 1980s.[6][7][8] Three other women also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, one of whom later recanted her story.[9][10][11][12] None of the accusations were corroborated by eyewitness testimony, and Kavanaugh denied them. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a supplemental hearing over the allegations and voted 11–10 along party lines to advance the confirmation to a full Senate vote.[13] On October 6, the full Senate confirmed Kavanaugh by a vote of 50–48.[14][15]\n\n\nSince the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020, Kavanaugh has come to be regarded as a swing vote on the Court.[16][17] He was the target of an assassination attempt in June 2022; the suspect had hoped to disrupt the rulings in *Dobbs* and *Bruen*.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh was born on February 12, 1965, in Washington, D.C.,[19] the son of Martha Gamble (*née* Murphy) and Everett Edward Kavanaugh Jr.[20][21] He is of Irish Catholic descent on both sides of his family. His paternal great-grandfather immigrated to the United States from Roscommon, Ireland, in the late 19th century,[22][23] and his maternal Irish lineage goes back to his great-great-grandparents settling in New Jersey.[22] Kavanaugh's father was a lawyer and served as the president of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association for two decades.[24] His mother was a history teacher at Woodson and McKinley high schools in Washington in the 1960s and 1970s. She earned a Juris Doctor degree from American University in 1978 and served from 1995 to 2001 as a Maryland Circuit Court judge in Montgomery County, Maryland.[25][26]\n\n\nKavanaugh was raised in Bethesda, Maryland. As a teenager, he attended Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit boys' college prep school, where he was two years ahead of Neil Gorsuch, with whom he later clerked at the Supreme Court and eventually served with as a Supreme Court justice.[27][28] He was captain of the basketball team and was a wide receiver and cornerback on the football team.[29] Kavanaugh was also friends with classmate Mark Judge; both were in the same class with Maryland state senator Richard Madaleno.[30][31][32][33] In his yearbook Kavanaugh called himself a \"Renate Alumnius\", a reference to a female student at a nearby Catholic school.[34]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Georgetown Prep in 1983,[34] Kavanaugh went to Yale University, as had his paternal grandfather.[35][36] Several of Kavanaugh's Yale classmates remembered him as a \"serious but not showy student\" who loved sports, especially basketball.[37] He unsuccessfully tried out for the Yale Bulldogs men's basketball team and later played for two years on the junior varsity team.[37] He wrote articles about basketball and other sports for the *Yale Daily News*,[37] and was a member of the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon.[38][39] He graduated from Yale in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts *cum laude* in history.[37]\n\n\nKavanaugh then attended Yale Law School, where he lived in a group house with future judge James E. Boasberg and played basketball with professor George L. Priest (sponsor of the school's Federalist Society).[40] He was a member of the *Yale Law Journal* and served as a notes editor during his third year. Kavanaugh graduated from Yale Law with a Juris Doctor degree in 1990.[41]\n\n\n\n## Legal career (1990–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh (second from left) with President George W. Bush and White House staffers\n### Clerkships[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh served as a law clerk for Judge Walter King Stapleton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit from 1990 to 1991.[40] During his clerkship, Stapleton wrote the majority opinion in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, in which the Third Circuit upheld many of Pennsylvania's abortion restrictions.[40] Kavanaugh then clerked for Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1991 to 1992. Yale Law professor George Priest recommended Kavanaugh to Kozinski, who was regarded as a feeder judge.[40] Kavanaugh interviewed for a clerkship with Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1992 term, but was not offered a clerkship.[40]\n\n\nAfter working as a summer associate for the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, Kavanaugh earned a one-year fellowship with the Solicitor General of the United States, Ken Starr, from 1992 to 1993.[42][43][44] He then clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994,[42] alongside Neil Gorsuch and with future federal judge Gary Feinerman.[27]\n\n\n\n### Ken Starr associate counsel[edit]\n\n\nAfter his Supreme Court clerkship, Kavanaugh again worked for Ken Starr until 1997 as an Associate Counsel in the Office of the Independent Counsel with colleagues Rod Rosenstein and Alex Azar.[45] In that capacity, he reopened an investigation into the 1993 gunshot death of Vincent Foster.[45][46][47] After three years, the investigation concluded that Foster had committed suicide. In a September 2018 *New York Times* op-ed, Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz criticized Kavanaugh for having invested federal money and other resources into investigating partisan conspiracy theories surrounding the cause of Foster's death.[48]\n\n\nAfter working in private practice in 1997–98, Kavanaugh rejoined Starr as an Associate Counselor in 1998.[49] In *Swidler & Berlin v. United States* (1998), Kavanaugh argued his first and only case before the Supreme Court. Arguing for Starr's office, Kavanaugh asked the Court to disregard attorney–client privilege in relation to the investigation of Foster's death.[50] The court rejected Kavanaugh's arguments by a vote of 6–3.[51]\n\n\nKavanaugh was a principal author of the *Starr Report*, released in September 1998, on the Bill Clinton–Monica Lewinsky sex scandal; the report argued on broad grounds for Clinton's impeachment.[45] Kavanaugh had urged Starr to ask Clinton sexually graphic questions,[52][53] and described Clinton as being involved in \"a conspiracy to obstruct justice\", having \"disgraced his office\" and \"lied to the American people\".[54][55] The report provided extensive and explicit descriptions of each of Clinton's sexual encounters with Lewinsky, a level of detail the authors called \"essential\" to the case against Clinton.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh (blue shirt) with President Bush, Andy Card, and Condoleezza Rice\nIn December 2000, Kavanaugh joined the legal team of George W. Bush, which was trying to stop the ballot recount in Florida.[57] After Bush became president in January 2001, White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales hired Kavanaugh as an associate.[40] There, Kavanaugh worked on the Enron scandal, the successful nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts, and the unsuccessful nomination of Miguel Estrada to the Court of Appeals.[40] Starting in July 2003, he served as Assistant to the President and White House staff secretary,[43] succeeding Harriet Miers.[58] In that position he was responsible for coordinating all documents going to and from the president.\n\n\n\n### Private practice[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1997 to 1998, Kavanaugh was an associate at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Kavanaugh rejoined Kirkland & Ellis in 1999 and eventually became a partner.[49][43] While there in 2000, he was *pro bono* counsel of record for relatives of Elián González, a six-year-old rescued Cuban boy. After the boy's mother's death at sea, his relatives in the U.S. wanted to keep him from returning to the care of his sole surviving parent, his father in Cuba. Kavanaugh was among a series of lawyers who unsuccessfully sought to stop efforts to repatriate González to Cuba.[59] The district court, Circuit Court and Supreme Court all followed precedent, refusing to block the repatriation.[60]\n\n\nAlso at Kirkland & Ellis, Kavanaugh authored two amicus briefs to the Supreme Court that supported religious activities and expressions in public places.[60] The first, in *Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe* (2000), argued that a student speaker at football games voted for by a majority of students should be treated as private speech in a limited public forum; the second, in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School*, argued that a Christian Bible instruction program should have the same after-school access to school facilities as other non-curriculum-related student groups.[61]\n\n\n\n### Federalist Society[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh has been a member of the Federalist Society since 1988.[62][63] In the administration of George W. Bush, he held a key position that involved judicial appointments. Bush judicial nominees who were Federalist Society members included John Roberts and Samuel Alito, both appointed to the Supreme Court, and about half the judges appointed to the courts of appeals.[64]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Circuit Judge (2006–2018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh is sworn into the D.C. Circuit by Justice Anthony Kennedy as his wife holds the bible and President Bush looks on, 2006. Coincidentally, Kavanaugh would be sworn into the U.S. Supreme Court 12 years later as Kennedy's replacement.\nPresident George W. Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 25, 2003,[65] but his nomination stalled in the Senate for nearly three years. Democratic senators accused him of being too partisan, with Senator Dick Durbin calling him the \"Forrest Gump of Republican politics\".[66][67] In 2003, the American Bar Association had rated Kavanaugh \"well qualified\" (its highest category), but after doing dozens more interviews in 2006, downgraded him to \"qualified\".[68]\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee recommended he be confirmed on a 10–8 party-line vote on May 11, 2006,[69] and he was confirmed by the Senate on May 26 by a vote of 57–36.[70][71] Kavanaugh was sworn in on June 1.[72] He was the fourth judge nominated to the D.C. Circuit by Bush and confirmed. Kavanaugh began hearing cases on September 11 and had his formal investiture on September 27.[73]\n\n\nIn July 2007, senators Patrick Leahy and Dick Durbin accused Kavanaugh of lying to the Judiciary Committee when he denied being involved in formulating the Bush administration's detention and interrogation policies. In 2002, Kavanaugh had told other White House lawyers that he believed Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy would not approve of denying legal counsel to prisoners detained as enemy combatants.[74][75] The issue reemerged in July 2018 after Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court.[76]\n\n\n\n### Notable cases[edit]\n\n\nOn the 14 occasions on which Kavanaugh authored opinions that were considered by the Supreme Court, the Court adopted his position 13 times and reversed his position once. These included cases involving environmental regulations, criminal procedure, the separation of powers and extraterritorial jurisdiction in human rights abuse cases.[40][77] He was regarded as a feeder judge.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn the October 2017 decision *Garza v. Hargan*, Kavanaugh joined an unsigned, divided panel of the D.C. Circuit in holding that the Office of Refugee Resettlement does not violate an unaccompanied alien minor's constitutional right to an abortion by requiring that she first be appointed a sponsor before traveling to obtain the abortion, provided \"the process of securing a sponsor to whom the minor is released occurs expeditiously\".[79][80] Days later, the *en banc* D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment, with Kavanaugh dissenting.[80][81] In his dissent, he criticized the majority for creating \"a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand\".[82] The girl then obtained an abortion.[80] In 2018, in a follow-up petition from the Solicitor General of the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the *en banc* D.C. Circuit's judgment and the girl's claim was ultimately dismissed as moot and does not serve as precedent.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction in the case.[84][85] In his dissent, he compared the individual mandate to a tax. After a unanimous panel found that the ACA did not violate the Constitution's Origination Clause in *Sissel v. United States Department of Health & Human Services* (2014), Kavanaugh wrote a long dissent from the denial of rehearing *en banc*.[86][87] In May 2015, he dissented from a decision that denied an en banc rehearing of *Priests for Life v. HHS*, in which the panel upheld the ACA's contraceptive mandate accommodations against Priests for Life's Religious Freedom Restoration Act claims.[88][89] In *Zubik v. Burwell* (2016), the Supreme Court vacated the circuit's judgment in a per curiam decision.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Appointments Clause and separation of powers[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2008, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit found that the Constitution's Appointments Clause did not prevent the Sarbanes–Oxley Act from creating a board whose members were not directly removable by the president.[91][92] In *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board* (2010), the Supreme Court reversed the circuit court's judgment by a vote of 5–4.[93]\n\n\nIn 2015, Kavanaugh found that those directly regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could challenge the constitutionality of its design.[94][95] In October 2016, he wrote for a divided panel finding that the CFPB's design was unconstitutional, and made the CFPB director removable by the president of the United States.[96][97] In January 2018, the *en banc* D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment by a vote of 7–3, over Kavanaugh's dissent.[98][99]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Kavanaugh issued an extraordinary writ of *mandamus* requiring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to process the license application of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, over the dissent of Judge Merrick Garland.[100][101] In April 2014, Kavanaugh dissented when the court found that Labor Secretary Tom Perez could issue workplace safety citations against SeaWorld regarding the multiple killings of its workers by Tilikum, an orca.[102][103]\n\n\nAfter Kavanaugh wrote for a divided panel striking down a Clean Air Act regulation, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 6–2 in *EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P.* (2014).[104][105] Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing *en banc* of a unanimous panel opinion upholding the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5–4 in *Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency* (2014).[106][107] After Kavanaugh dissented from a *per curiam* decision allowing the agency to disregard cost–benefit analysis, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5–4 in *Michigan v. EPA* (2015).[108][109]\n\n\n\n#### Extraterritorial jurisdiction[edit]\n\n\nIn *Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp.* (2007), Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court allowed a lawsuit making accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in Indonesia to proceed, arguing that the claims were not justiciable.[110][111] He dissented again when the circuit court later found that the corporation could be sued under the Alien Tort Statute of 1789.[77][112][113]\n\n\n\n#### First Amendment and free speech[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh wrote for unanimous three-judge district courts when they held that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act could restrict soft money donations to political parties and forbid campaign contributions by foreign citizens.[114][115] The Supreme Court summarily affirmed both those judgments on direct appeal.[116]\n\n\nIn 2014, Kavanaugh concurred in the judgment when the *en banc* D.C. Circuit found that the Free Speech Clause did not forbid the government from requiring meatpackers to include a country of origin label on their products.[117][118] In *United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC* (2016), he dissented when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear a rejected challenge to the net neutrality rule, writing, \"Congress did not clearly authorize the FCC to issue the net neutrality rule.\"[43][119][120]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment and civil liberties[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2010, Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing *en banc* after the circuit found that attaching a Global Positioning System tracking device to a vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.[121][122] The Supreme Court then affirmed the circuit's judgment in *United States v. Jones* (2012).[123] In February 2016, Kavanaugh dissented when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear police officers' rejected claims of qualified immunity for arresting partygoers in a vacant house.[43][124] The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the circuit's judgment in *District of Columbia v. Wesby* (2018).[125]\n\n\nIn *Klayman v. Obama* (2015), Kavanaugh concurred when the circuit court denied an *en banc* rehearing of its decision to vacate a district court order blocking the National Security Agency's warrantless bulk collection of telephony metadata,[126][127] writing that the metadata collection was not a search, and even if it were, no reasonable suspicion would be required because of the government's special need to prevent terrorist attacks.[128]\n\n\n\n#### National security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh holds his daughter while greeting British Prime Minister Tony Blair and President George W. Bush.\nIn April 2009, Kavanaugh wrote a long concurrence when the court found that detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp had no right to advance notice before being transferred to another country.[129][130] In *Kiyemba v. Obama* (2010), the Supreme Court vacated that judgment while refusing to review the matter.[131] In June 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a concurrence in judgment when the *en banc* D.C. Circuit found that the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory owners could not bring a defamation suit regarding the government's allegations that they were terrorists.[132][133] In October 2012, he wrote for a unanimous court when it found that the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause made it unlawful for the government to prosecute Salim Hamdan under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 on charges of providing material support for terrorism.[134][135]\n\n\nIn August 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a lengthy concurrence when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear Ghaleb Nassar Al Bihani's rejected claims that the international law of war limits the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.[43][136] In 2014, he concurred in the judgment when the *en banc* circuit found that Ali al-Bahlul could be retroactively convicted of war crimes, provided the existing statute already made it a crime \"because it does not alter the definition of the crime, the defenses or the punishment\".[137][138] In October 2016, Kavanaugh wrote the plurality opinion when the *en banc* circuit found al-Bahlul could be convicted by a military commission even if his offenses are not internationally recognized as war crimes.[139][140]\n\n\nIn *Meshal v. Higgenbotham* (2016), Kavanaugh concurred when the divided panel threw out a claim by an American that he had been disappeared by the FBI in a Kenyan black site.[141][142]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment and gun ownership[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court found that a ban on the sale of semi-automatic rifles was permissible under the Second Amendment. This case followed the landmark Supreme Court ruling *District of Columbia v. Heller* (2008).[143][144]\n\n\n\n#### Vaccine regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Kavanaugh wrote the opinion in *Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs v. Sebelius*,[145] holding that opponents of thimerosal-preserved vaccines lacked standing to challenge determinations by the Food and Drug Administration that vaccines and their components are safe and effective. SCOTUSblog provided the case as an example of the fact that \"[e]ven when Kavanaugh rejects a claim, he sometimes uses his discussion of standing to show that he has heard the plaintiff's argument and taken it seriously\".[146] Bloomberg wrote, \"Kavanaugh's opinion for the court repeatedly went out of its way to show it respected the Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs's (CoMeD) 'genuine concern' regarding thimerosal\", but nevertheless \"said the coalition was required to seek a ban through the executive or legislative branches\".[147]\n\n\n\n### Law clerk hiring practices[edit]\n\n\nTwenty-five of Kavanaugh's 48 law clerks have been women, and 13 people of color.[148] Some have been children of other judges and high-profile legal figures, including Clayton Kozinski (son of former federal Judge Alex Kozinski), Porter Wilkinson (daughter of Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III), Philip Alito (son of Justice Samuel Alito), Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld (daughter of Yale Law professors Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld), and Emily Chertoff (daughter of former DHS secretary Michael Chertoff).[149][150]\n\n\nOn September 20, 2018, *The Guardian* reported that two Yale professors had advised female law students at Yale that their physical appearance and femininity could play a role in securing a clerkship with Kavanaugh. Rubenfeld said that Kavanaugh \"hires women with a certain look\" but did not say what that \"look\" was.[151] Unnamed sources reported that Chua said that female applicants should exude \"model-like\" femininity and \"dress outgoing\" in job interviews with Kavanaugh. Responding to the report, Chua denied that Kavanaugh's hiring decisions were affected by female applicants' attractiveness, saying, \"Judge Kavanaugh's first and only litmus test in hiring has been excellence.\"[151] Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken announced an investigation of the matter,[152] but Yale did not find any cause for sanction. Chua returned to regular teaching in 2019.[153]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh and his family with President Donald Trump on July 9, 2018\nOn July 2, 2018, Kavanaugh was one of four U.S. Court of Appeals judges to receive a personal 45-minute interview by President Donald Trump as a potential replacement for Justice Anthony Kennedy.[154] On July 9, Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.[155][156] In his first public speech after the nomination, Kavanaugh said, \"No president has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.\"[157]\n\n\n\n### Legal philosophy and approach[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on |\n| Conservatismin the United States |\n| ![](image) |\n| Schools\n* Compassionate\n* Fiscal\n* Fusion\n* Libertarian\n* Moderate\n* Movement\n* Neo\n* Paleo\n* Progressive\n* Social\n* Traditionalist\n |\n| Principles\n* American exceptionalism\n* Anti-communism\n* Christian nationalism\n* Classical liberalism\n* Constitutionalism\n* Familialism\n* Family values\n* Federalism\n\t+ States' rights\n* Judeo-Christian values\n* Individualism\n* Law and order\n* Limited government\n* Militarism\n* Moral absolutism\n* Natural law\n* Patriotism\n* Republicanism\n* Right to bear arms\n* Rule of law\n* Tradition\n |\n| History\n* Conservative coalition\n* Conservative Democrat\n* Conservative Manifesto\n* Loyalists\n* McCarthyism\n* Modern timeline\n* New Right\n* Old Right\n* Overview\n* Reagan Doctrine\n* Reaganomics\n* Stalwart Republicans\n* Southern Agrarians\n |\n| Intellectuals\n* Anton\n* Babbitt\n* Bell\n* Bellow\n* Bloom\n* Boorstin\n* Buckley\n* Burnham\n* Chambers\n* Conquest\n* Derbyshire\n* Dolan\n* Durant\n* Eastman\n* Eliot\n* Francis\n* George\n* Goldberg\n* Gottfried\n* Hanson\n* Hazony\n* Hoppe\n* Jaffa\n* Kimball\n* Kirk\n* Kirkpatrick\n* Kreeft\n* Kristol (Irving)\n* Kuehnelt-Leddihn\n* Laffer\n* Lasch\n* Lovecraft\n* Lukacs\n* Mansfield\n* Mencken\n* Meyer\n* Molnar\n* Murray\n* Nisbet\n* Nock\n* O'Connor\n* Ong\n* Ransom\n* Repplier\n* Santayana\n* Sowell\n* Strauss\n* Sumner\n* Viereck\n* Voegelin\n* Washington\n* Weaver\n* Yarvin\n |\n| Politicians\n* Abbott\n* Adams\n* Quincy Adams\n* Agnew\n* Buchanan\n* Bush (George H.

Wade*, which ruled abortion bans unconstitutional, and *Furman v. Georgia*, which ruled all existing death penalty statutes unconstitutional.[160][161] Two law professors evaluated Kavanaugh's appellate court decisions for the *Washington Post,* rating his decisions in four areas: rights of criminal defendants; support for rules regarding stricter enforcement of environmental protection; upholding the rights of labor unions; and siding with those bringing suits alleging discrimination. They found he had the most conservative voting record on the D.C. Circuit in three of those policy areas, and the second-most in the fourth, between 2003 and 2018.[162]\n\n\nDuring his hearing, Kavanaugh said that he had often said the four greatest moments in Supreme Court history were *Brown v. Board of Education*, *Marbury v. Madison*, *Youngstown Steel*, and *United States v. Nixon*, with *Brown* the single greatest.[163]\n\n\nAccording to the Judicial Common Space scores, a score based on the ideology scores of the home state senators and the president who nominated the judge to the federal bench, Clarence Thomas was the only justice more conservative than Kavanaugh. By this metric, Kavanaugh's confirmation shifted the court to the right.[164] Had Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland been confirmed in 2016, Stephen Breyer would have become the median swing vote when Kennedy retired. However, since Antonin Scalia was replaced by another conservative (Gorsuch), it was expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would become the median swing vote on the Supreme Court upon Kavanaugh's confirmation.[165]\n\n\n\n### Senate Judiciary Committee public hearings[edit]\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled three or four days of public hearings on Kavanaugh's nomination, commencing on September 4, 2018. The hearings were delayed at the onset by objections from the Democratic members about the absence of records of Kavanaugh's time in the George W. Bush administration. The Democrats also complained that 42,000 pages of documents had been received only the night before the first day of hearings.[166] Republicans asserted that the volume of documents available on Kavanaugh equaled that of the previous five nominees to the court; the Democrats responded that only 15% of the documents they had requested about Kavanaugh had been provided. Numerous motions by the Democrats to adjourn or suspend the hearings were ruled out of order by Chairman Chuck Grassley, who argued that Kavanaugh had written over 300 legal opinions available for review. The first day's session closed after statements from each senator and the nominee, with question-and-answer periods to begin the next day.[167]\n\n\nDuring the first round of questions from senators on September 5, 2018, Kavanaugh held to his earlier stated position that he would not express an opinion on matters that might come before the Court. He thus refused to promise to recuse himself from any case, including any that might involve Trump. He also declined to comment on coverage of preexisting healthcare conditions, semiautomatic rifle possession, *Roe v. Wade*, or the president's power to self-pardon. He expounded at length on various Constitutional amendments, stare decisis (the role of legal precedent in shaping subsequent judicial rulings), and the president's power to dismiss federal employees. As in the previous session, there were frequent outbursts of protest in the audience, requiring security intervention and removal, as well as repeated procedural objections by Democrats.[168]\n\n\nThe committee's third day of hearings began with a furor over the release of emails by Kavanaugh related to concern about potential racial profiling in security screenings. The day continued with Kavanaugh's attempts to articulate his jurisprudence, including refusing to answer direct questions about matters he called hypothetical.[169] Senator Chris Coons had tendered Kavanaugh written questions about any knowledge of inappropriate behavior on the part of judge Alex Kozinski, for whom Kavanaugh had clerked, including his circulations of sexually explicit emails via his \"Easy Rider Gag List\". According to *The Intercept*, though Coons had asked him to review his emails from Kozinski, Kavanaugh replied, \"I do not remember\".[170] During his testimony, Kavanaugh said that Kozinski's 2017 exposure as an alleged prolific sexual harasser was a surprising \"gut punch\". *The Guardian* reported that their sources disputed Kavanaugh's account because Kozinski's alleged behavior was reportedly widely known among those in the judicial system and its exposure culminated in his abrupt resignation from the bench.[171]\n\n\n\nThe committee released a 2003 email in which Kavanaugh said, \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to [*Roe v. Wade*] as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current justices on the Court would do so.\"[172] Kavanaugh stressed that he was commenting on the views of legal scholars at the time, not his own views, and noted that the case had been reaffirmed on a number of occasions since 2003.[173] Senator Susan Collins indicated that Kavanaugh's statement did not contradict his personal assurance to her that *Roe* is settled law.[174] Kavanaugh noted that *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992), which reaffirmed *Roe v. Wade*, was \"precedent on precedent\". According to Kavanaugh, *Casey* is a key decision about when the Court's precedent may be overturned.[175]\n\n\nOn September 27, the committee held an additional day of public hearings to discuss allegations that Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct while in high school. The only witnesses were Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, his accuser.[176] Republican members of the committee did not question Ford directly; questioning on their behalf was done by Rachel Mitchell, a career prosecutor from Maricopa County, Arizona.[177] Grassley cut her questioning short, after which the Republican members of the committee questioned him themselves.[178][179] Alternating with their questions, Democratic members of the committee questioned Ford and Kavanaugh.[180] Ford repeated and expanded upon her earlier allegations, saying that Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge, both \"visibly drunk\", had locked her into a bedroom, where Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take off her clothes while Judge watched. She said she \"believed he was going to rape me\" and feared for her life when he held his hand over her mouth. In his opening statement, Kavanaugh claimed the accusations were a \"political hit\" by left-wing activists and Democrats, saying he faced retaliation \"on behalf of the Clintons\" for his work on the Starr Report against Bill Clinton.[181][182][183] Leland Keyser, Ford's friend who Ford said was present during the alleged attack, has denied that it took place, and questioned certain aspects of the story. Keyser also stated she felt pressured by people to support Ford's story, something she told the FBI about.[184] In response to his testimony, more than 2,400 law professors signed a letter saying that the Senate should not confirm him because \"he did not display the impartiality and judicial temperament requisite to sit on the highest court of our land.\"[185]\n\n\n\n### Sexual assault allegations[edit]\n\n\n#### Christine Blasey Ford[edit]\n\n\nIn early July 2018, Kavanaugh's name was on a shortlist of nominees for the Supreme Court. Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, contacted a *Washington Post* tipline and her U.S. Representative, Anna Eshoo, with accusations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were in high school.[7][186] On July 30, 2018, Ford wrote to Senator Dianne Feinstein to inform her of her accusation against Kavanaugh,[187] requesting that it be kept confidential.[188] After a September 12 report in *The Intercept*,[7][186][189] Feinstein confirmed that a complaint had been made against Kavanaugh by a woman who had requested not to be identified. Feinstein said that the woman had claimed that, when they were both in high school, Kavanaugh had tried to force himself on her while she was being physically restrained.[190][191] The same day, Feinstein said she had forwarded the woman's accusation to federal authorities.[192][193]\n\n\nOn September 16, Ford publicized her allegations and claimed Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when she was 15 and he was 17.[194][195] She said that in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, one of Kavanaugh's friends from Georgetown Prep, corralled her in a bedroom at a house party in Maryland and turned up the music playing in the room. According to Ford, Kavanaugh pinned her to the bed, groped her, ground against her, tried to pull off her clothes, and covered her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream.[196] Ford said she was afraid that Kavanaugh might inadvertently kill her during the attack,[197] and believed he was going to rape her.[198] Ford stated that she escaped when Judge jumped on the bed, knocking them all to the floor.[194][199]\n\n\nKavanaugh issued the following statement through the White House: \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\"[193][192] Republicans criticized the decision to withhold \"a vague, anonymous accusation for months\" before releasing it on the \"eve of [Kavanaugh's] confirmation\" as an attempt to delay his confirmation hearings.[200][201] Kavanaugh released a statement on the evening before his and Ford's scheduled testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said that due to the serious nature of the allegations, both he and Ford deserved to be heard. He also stated, \"I am innocent of this charge.\"[202]\n\n\nOn September 19, the Senate Judiciary Committee invited Kavanaugh and Ford to testify about the allegation. Kavanaugh agreed to testify on September 19.[203] Ford requested that the FBI investigate the matter first, but Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley declined the request, and gave Ford a deadline of September 21 to inform the committee whether she intended to testify. He added that Ford was welcome to appear before the committee privately or publicly.[204] On September 20, Ford's attorney opened negotiations with the committee to reschedule the hearing under \"terms that are fair and which ensure her safety\".[205] A bipartisan Judiciary Committee panel and Ford's representatives agreed to a hearing after September 24.[206]\n\n\nFord stated that Leland Ingham Keyser, a lifelong friend, was present at the party where the alleged assault took place. On September 22, Keyser stated through her attorney that she did not know Kavanaugh and had no memory of the party or a sexual assault. The attorney did confirm that Keyser was a friend of Ford's,[207] and Keyser told *The Washington Post* that she believed Ford's allegation.[208][209]\n\n\nOn October 4, 2018, the White House announced that it had found no corroboration of Ford's allegation after reviewing the FBI's latest probe into Kavanaugh's past.[210] Her attorneys tweeted, \"Those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth.\"[211]\n\n\nIn September 2019, *New York Times* reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin published *The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation*. They reported that Keyser \"thought the whole setup Ford described ... sounded wrong\", and that she \"challenged Ford's accuracy\", quoting Keyser as saying, \"I don't have any confidence in the story\".[212] According to *The Washington Post*, the book revealed that \"Keyser also said she spoke with many people who 'wanted me to remember something different'—suggesting that there was pressure on her to toe the line [against Kavanaugh]\".[213]\n\n\n\n#### Deborah Ramirez[edit]\n\n\nOn September 23, 2018, Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer of *The New Yorker* published an article with another sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh. Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale University with Kavanaugh, alleged he exposed himself to her and thrust his penis against her face after they had both been drinking at a college party during the 1983–84 academic year. Kavanaugh said, \"This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen.\"[214] *The New Yorker* spoke to four classmates, three identified as eyewitnesses but all denied witnessing the event.[214] *The New York Times* interviewed several dozen of Ramirez's classmates in an attempt to corroborate her story, and could find no firsthand witnesses to the alleged assault, but several classmates recalled that they had heard about it in the subsequent days and believed Ramirez.[215] According to *The New York Times*, \"Ramirez herself told the press and friends that, initially, she was not absolutely certain it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her, but after corresponding with friends who had secondhand knowledge of the incident, and taking time to refresh her recollection, stated that she was certain Kavanaugh was her assailant.\"[216] *The Washington Post* analyzed Ramirez's allegation and concluded, \"Ramirez's accusation has the dual distinction of having more potential corroboration and less actual corroboration than Ford's\".[217]\n\n\n\n#### Julie Swetnick[edit]\n\n\nAttorney Michael Avenatti tweeted on September 23, 2018, that he represented a woman who had \"credible information\" about Kavanaugh and Judge. Avenatti said his client would be willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[218][219][220] On September 26, Avenatti revealed the woman to be Julie Swetnick, a former government employee. In a sworn statement, Swetnick described attending \"well over ten house parties in the Washington, D.C. area during the years 1981–1983 where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present\". She described witnessing efforts by Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh to cause girls to become inebriated so they could be gang raped. Kavanaugh called her allegations \"ridiculous\" and Avenatti's allegation as a whole a \"farce\".[10] *The Wall Street Journal* reported that it had contacted \"dozens\" of her former classmates and colleagues but failed to reach anyone with knowledge of her allegations and that none of her friends had come forward publicly to support her claims.[221] In an interview with NBC News, Swetnick clarified that she did not personally witness Kavanaugh or Judge spike any drinks, and accused Avenatti of twisting her words. She further clarified that she did not personally witness efforts by Kavanaugh or Judge to cause girls to become inebriated so they could be gang raped. Swetnick provided NBC News with the names of friends who attended the parties, but none could corroborate her claims, while some said they did not know her.[222][223] Grassley referred Swetnick and Avenatti to the Justice Department for criminal investigation regarding claims that they engaged in \"conspiracy, false statements and obstruction of Congress\".[224]\n\n\n\n#### Judy Munro-Leighton[edit]\n\n\nOn September 19, Judy Munro-Leighton accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in an anonymous letter signed \"Jane Doe\", which was addressed to Grassley but mailed to Senator Kamala Harris. On September 26, the Senate committee interrogated Kavanaugh about this accusation. Kavanaugh called the accusation \"ridiculous\".[11] On November 1, Munro-Leighton talked to committee staff members. During the conversation she changed her story, denying that she had penned the anonymous letter and saying she had contacted Congress as \"a ploy\" to \"get attention\".[225] On November 2, Grassley announced Munro-Leighton's identity, and described her accusations as fabricated.[11] She was referred to the Department of Justice and FBI for making false accusations and obstructing justice.[11]\n\n\n\n#### FBI investigation and ethics complaints[edit]\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Republican leadership of the committee indicated that they planned to hold a committee vote on the nomination the next day, September 28, with a procedural vote on the Senate floor on September 29.[226] On September 28, the committee voted along party lines to advance the nomination to the full Senate; Senator Jeff Flake's vote in support was conditioned on delaying the vote in the full Senate for a week to allow the FBI to investigate Ford's claims. Later, Senators Joe Manchin and Lisa Murkowski also said they would not vote to confirm without an FBI investigation.[227] On this request from the Judiciary Committee, Trump ordered a \"supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh's file\", to be limited in scope and completed within a week.[228] The report was transmitted to the White House on October 3 and from there to the Senate on October 4, where senators were permitted to review the report one at a time in secrecy. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote on the confirmation on October 6.[229] Democrats called the FBI investigation incomplete, a \"farce\", a \"sham\" and \"a horrific cover-up\" that omitted key witnesses at the White House's direction.[230][231] According to *The Washington Post*, the White House stopped the FBI from investigating possible falsehoods in Kavanaugh's testimony to Congress about his drinking habits during his youth.[211]\n\n\nEighty-three ethics complaints were brought against Kavanaugh regarding his conduct during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Chief Justice Roberts appointed a special federal panel of judges to investigate them. In December 2018, the panel dismissed all the complaints, calling them \"serious\" but deciding that lower court judges have no authority to investigate Supreme Court justices.[232]\n\n\n\n#### 2023 *Justice* film[edit]\n\n\nDoug Liman's 2023 documentary *Justice* recounts the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, including the testimony of Ford and Ramirez. It features a never-before-heard audio recording made by Partnership for Public Service president and CEO Max Stier, a Yale colleague of Kavanaugh's, that corroborates Ramirez's charges and suggests that Kavanaugh violated another unnamed woman. Stier says that he witnessed Kavanaugh with his pants down with a group of rowdy soccer players forcing a drunk female freshman to hold Kavanaugh's penis. Stier also says that he had heard from classmates about Ramirez's similar encounter with Kavanaugh, which she personally describes in the film.[233]\n\n\nThe documentary also highlights the narratives Kavanaugh advanced to sway public opinion and gain Republicans' support, which reviewers described as misleading. Reviewers were persuaded that Kavanaugh and his team were aware of Ford's and Ramirez's charges before they became public and preemptively countered them by planting alternate narratives with friends and acquaintances.[234][235]\n\n\n\n### Senate action[edit]\n\n\nOn October 5, the Senate voted 51–49 to invoke cloture, advancing the nomination to a final floor vote expected on October 6. This was enabled through the application of the so-called \"nuclear option\", or a simple majority vote, rather than the historical three-fifths supermajority in place before April 2017.[236] The vote was along party lines, with the exception of Democrat Joe Manchin voting yes and Republican Lisa Murkowski voting no.[237][238]\n\n\nOn October 6, the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court by a 50–48 vote.[239] One senator, Republican Steve Daines, who supported the nomination, was absent during the vote due to his attendance at his daughter's wedding that day, and Murkowski voted \"present\" despite her opposition so that their votes would cancel out and the balance of the vote would be retained—a rarely used traditional courtesy known as a \"pair between senators\".[240] All Republicans except Daines and Murkowski voted to confirm Kavanaugh, and all Democrats except Joe Manchin voted not to.[241] Kavanaugh's confirmation vote was historically close. The only Supreme Court confirmation that was closer was the vote on Stanley Matthews, nominated by President James A. Garfield in 1881. Matthews was confirmed by a single vote, 24–23; no other justice has been confirmed by a single vote.[242][243][244] In *percentage* terms, Kavanaugh's vote was even closer than Matthews's. Matthews received 51.06% of the vote to Kavanaugh's 51.02%.[245]\n\n\n\n### Swearing-in[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh was sworn in as the 114th justice of the Supreme Court on the evening of October 6, 2018.[246] The Constitutional Oath was administered by Chief Justice Roberts and the Judicial Oath was administered by Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh succeeded on the Court. This private ceremony was followed by a public ceremony at the White House on October 8.[15][247][248] Upon joining the Court, Kavanaugh became the first Supreme Court justice to hire an all-female team of law clerks.[249][250]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2018–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh being sworn in to succeed Anthony Kennedy as an associate justice on October 8, 2018\nKavanaugh began his tenure as Supreme Court justice on October 9, 2018, hearing arguments for *Stokeling v. United States* and *United States v. Stitt*.[251]\n\n\n\n### Circuit assignment[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Kavanaugh was reassigned to both the Sixth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit.[252] He had previously been assigned to the Seventh Circuit, which covers federal courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.[253] Circuit justices are principally responsible for responding to emergency requests (for example, applications for emergency stays of executions)[254] that arise from the circuit's jurisdiction, either by the assigned justice alone or else by the justice's referring them to the full Court for review.\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh wrote his first Supreme Court opinion on January 8, 2019, in *Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc.*, a unanimous decision reversing an appeals court opinion that had allowed a court to decide whether an issue in a contract between a dental equipment manufacturer and distributor should be decided by arbitration.[255]\n\n\nOn February 27, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the court's liberal justices in *Garza v. Idaho*, a case in which the Court held that the Sixth Amendment's presumption of prejudice resulting from ineffective assistance of counsel applies to situations in which an attorney declines to file an appeal because an appeal waiver was signed as part of a plea agreement.[256]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, as a swing vote, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the Court's four more liberal justices to decline to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas, which sought to block women from choosing to receive Medicaid-funded medical care from Planned Parenthood clinics. Two lower appeals courts had ruled that the federal law creating Medicaid protects patients' rights to choose any provider which is \"qualified to perform\" the needed services.[257]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Kavanaugh joined three of his conservative colleagues in voting to reject a stay of a Louisiana law to restrict abortion.[258] He issued his own dissenting opinion.[259] *CNBC* reported that \"Kavanaugh agreed [with three conservative justices], but wrote separately that he would be open to reconsidering the legality of the law if the dire warnings from abortion rights groups materialized.\"[260] The Supreme Court decided this case, *June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo*, on June 29, 2020, striking down Louisiana's requirement for abortion providers to hold hospital admitting privileges. Kavanaugh dissented.[261] In September 2021, by a 5–4 vote, the Court declined an emergency petition to temporarily block enforcement of the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans nearly all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Kavanaugh was in the majority, joined by Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Barrett.[262] In June 2022, in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, Kavanaugh joined the same four justices in voting to completely overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[263]\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nAlso in February, Kavanaugh was part of the majority in decisions relating to the death penalty. On February 7, 2019, he was part of the majority in a 5–4 decision rejecting a Muslim prisoner's request to delay his execution in order to have an imam present.[264] On February 19, 2019, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the Court's four liberal justices in a 6–3 decision blocking the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.[265][266] In January 2022, he voted with the majority in a 5–4 decision to allow an execution to proceed in Alabama.[267] In 2023 Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion in *Reed v. Goertz*, ruling that Texas death row inmate Rodney Reed could seek DNA testing on evidence in his case despite the state's statute of limitations on such testing.[268]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2020, in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, the Supreme Court ruled 6–3 that the workplace nondiscrimination protections in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should be interpreted as protecting people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Kavanaugh wrote a dissent in which he argued that sexual orientation discrimination has always been understood as distinct from sex discrimination. He conceded that sexual orientation discrimination \"may, as a very literal matter, entail making a distinction based on sex\"; nonetheless, he said, \"to fire one employee because she is a woman and another employee because he is gay implicates two distinct societal concerns, reveals two distinct biases, imposes two distinct harms, and falls within two distinct statutory prohibitions.\" He said that any change to the relevant law ought to be made by Congress, not by judges; and that \"both the rule of law and democratic accountability badly suffer when a court adopts a hidden or obscure interpretation of the law, and not its ordinary meaning.\"[269] Kavanaugh's dissent did not discuss gender identity or use the word \"transgender\", although transgender rights were at issue in the case. In a footnote, he wrote that his analysis \"on the basis of sexual orientation would apply in much the same way to discrimination on the basis of gender identity.\"[270] In October 2020, Kavanaugh agreed with the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to deny an appeal brought by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[271]\n\n\nIn 2021, Kavanaugh joined the majority opinion in *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*, ruling in favor of a Catholic adoption and social service agency that had been denied funding by the City of Philadelphia because it does not place children for adoption with same-sex couples; the ruling also declined to overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices\".[272] The same month, Kavanaugh was among the six justices who rejected the appeal of a Washington State florist, whom lower courts had ruled violated non-discrimination laws by refusing to sell floral arrangements to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage, leaving the lower courts' judgments in place.[273][274][275] In November 2021, Kavanaugh voted with the majority of justices in a 6–3 decision to decline to hear an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[276] Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented; because four votes are required to hear an appeal, the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[277][278]\n\n\n\n### President Trump's taxes[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2020, in *Trump v. Vance*, the Supreme Court ruled in two 7–2 decisions that the Manhattan District Attorney could access Trump's tax records, but that the issue of whether Congress could access the same records needed to be processed through the lower courts. Kavanaugh joined Roberts, Gorsuch, and the court's four Democratic appointees in the majority;[279] Justices Thomas and Alito dissented.[280] The rulings mean that the Manhattan DA will have access to the records while Congress does not, pending the outcome of the case in lower courts.[281]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nEight days before the 2020 presidential election Kavanaugh concurred that absentee votes properly cast in Wisconsin but received after November 3 must be discarded, joining the Court's conservatives in a ruling that requires deferral to state officials on elections.[282][283] On October 19, Kavanaugh voted to grant a request for a stay that would have prevented ballots sent before Election Day but delivered within three days after it from being counted. The Court was split 4–4, so the ruling by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania requiring all votes to be counted stood, but the case may be reheard.[284] Kavanaugh sided with Roberts and three liberal justices in a 5-3 majority to allow voting extension in North Carolina.[285]\n\n\n\n### Compensation of college athletes[edit]\n\n\nIn his concurrence in *National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston* in June 2021, in which the Court ruled unanimously that college sports were not exempt from antitrust law, Kavanaugh called the NCAA \"a massive money-raising enterprise on the backs of student athletes who are not fairly compensated.\" No one else, he said, could \"not ... pay workers a fair market rate on the theory that their product is defined by not paying their workers a fair market rate.\" He said there were \"serious questions\" about other rules on compensation.[286]\n\n\n\n### Attempted assassination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brett Kavanaugh assassination plot\n\nIn the early morning of June 8, 2022, Nicholas John Roske traveled from California to Kavanaugh's home in Maryland with plans to break into the home, murder Kavanaugh, and commit suicide.[18][287] After seeing two U.S. Marshals outside Kavanaugh's home, Roske turned himself in by calling 9-1-1. He said his attempt to murder Kavanaugh stemmed from dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court's leaked draft opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, as well as the potential for the Court to loosen gun control laws under the Second Amendment. Roske was armed with a pistol, two magazines and ammunition, pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, a screwdriver, a nail punch, a crowbar, a pistol light, duct tape, and other items. He has been charged with attempted murder.[18]\n\n\n\n## Teaching and scholarship[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh taught full-term courses on separation of powers at Harvard Law School from 2008 to 2015, on the Supreme Court at Harvard Law School between 2014 and 2018, on National Security and Foreign Relations Law at Yale Law School in 2011, and on Constitutional Interpretation at Georgetown University Law Center in 2007. He was named the Samuel Williston Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School in 2009.[288] In 2008, Kavanaugh was hired as a visiting professor by Elena Kagan, then the dean of Harvard Law School. According to *The Boston Globe*, he was generous with his time and accessible, and quickly became a student favorite. He often dined in Cambridge with students and offered references and career advice.[289][290] Kavanaugh received high evaluations from his students, including J. D. Vance.[291] After the allegations of sexual misconduct against him, Harvard Law School graduates[*which?*] petitioned Harvard to rescind Kavanaugh's position as a lecturer.[*citation needed*] Shortly thereafter, Kavanaugh voluntarily withdrew from teaching at Harvard for the 2019 winter semester.[292] In the summer of 2019, he joined the faculty of George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School as a visiting professor, co-teaching a summer course in Runnymede, England, on the origins and creation of the United States Constitution.[293]\n\n\nIn 2009, Kavanaugh wrote an article for the *Minnesota Law Review* in which he argued that Congress should exempt U.S. presidents from civil lawsuits while in office[294] because, among other things, such lawsuits could be \"time-consuming and distracting\" for the president and would thus \"ill serve the public interest, especially in times of financial or national security crisis\".[295] Kavanaugh argued that if a president \"does something dastardly\", they may be impeached by the House of Representatives, convicted by the Senate, and criminally prosecuted after leaving office.[294] He asserted that the U.S. would have been better off if President Clinton could have \"focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots\".[294] This article garnered attention in 2018 when Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court by Trump, whose 2016 presidential campaign was at the time the subject of a federal probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.[295]\n\n\nWhen reviewing a book on statutory interpretation by Second Circuit Chief Judge Robert Katzmann, Kavanaugh observed that judges often cannot agree on a statute if its text is ambiguous.[296] To remedy this, he encouraged judges to first seek the \"best reading\" of the statute, through \"interpreting the words of the statute\" as well as the context of the statute as a whole, and only then apply other interpretive techniques that may justify an interpretation that differs from the \"best meaning\", such as constitutional avoidance, legislative history, and Chevron deference.[296]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Kavanaugh family with President Bush\nKavanaugh and Ashley Estes, the personal secretary to former President George W. Bush,[297] married in 2004; the couple have two daughters.[298] They live in Chevy Chase Section Five, Maryland.[40]\n\n\nKavanaugh ran the Boston Marathon in 2010 and 2015.[299] His bibs bore non-qualifying numbers, assigned for a charity or a \"guest\" rather than an age-based time qualifier.[300] He also has completed many shorter races, from 5 km to 10 miles.[301][302]\n\n\nKavanaugh is a Roman Catholic[297] and serves as a regular lector at the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament at Hanceville, Alabama. He has helped serve meals to the homeless as part of church programs, and has tutored at the Washington Jesuit Academy, a Catholic private school in the District of Columbia.[297][303]\n\n\nAt his May 2006 confirmation hearing to the District of Columbia Circuit, he stated that he was a registered Republican.[1] In 2018, Kavanaugh's reported salary was $220,600 as a federal judge and $27,000 as a lecturer at Harvard Law School.[304]\n\n\nIn 2022, Kavanaugh's home was the site of protests following the leak of a draft majority opinion for the Supreme Court case *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.*[305][306]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* Kavanaugh, Brett (1989). \"Note: Defense Presence and Participation: A Procedural Minimum for Batson v.

He was nominated by President Donald Trump on January 31, 2017, and has served since April 10, 2017.\n\n\nGorsuch spent his early life in Denver, Colorado, then lived in Bethesda, Maryland, while attending Georgetown Preparatory School. Upon graduating, he matriculated at Columbia University, where he became an established writer. Gorsuch received his legal education at Harvard Law School and in 1993, after 15 years as a practicing attorney, obtained a Doctor of Philosophy in jurisprudence from the University of Oxford on a Marshall Scholarship. His doctoral thesis concerned the morality of assisted suicide and was written under the supervision of legal philosopher John Finnis.\n\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Gorsuch was in private practice with the law firm of Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick. He was the principal deputy associate attorney general at the United States Department of Justice from 2005 until his appointment to the Tenth Circuit. President George W. Bush nominated Gorsuch to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on May 10, 2006, to replace Judge David M. Ebel, who achieved senior status that same year.\n\n\nGorsuch is a proponent of textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in interpreting the United States Constitution.[2][3][4] Along with Justice Clarence Thomas, he is an advocate of natural law jurisprudence.[5] Gorsuch clerked for Judge David B. Sentelle of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992 and U.S. Supreme Court justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994. He is the first Supreme Court justice to serve alongside a justice for whom he once clerked (Kennedy).[6] During his tenure on the Supreme Court he has written the majority opinion in landmark cases such as *Bostock v. Clayton County* on LGBT rights, *McGirt v. Oklahoma* on Native American law, *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* on personal religious observance, *303 Creative LLC v. Elenis* on free speech, and *Ramos v. Louisiana* on juries' guilty verdicts.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch was born on August 29, 1967, in Denver, Colorado, to Anne Gorsuch Burford (née McGill; 1942–2004) and David Ronald Gorsuch (1937–2001).[7][8] He was the eldest of three children,[9] and is a fourth-generation Coloradan.[10] Both of Gorsuch's parents were lawyers, and his mother served in the Colorado House of Representatives from 1976 to 1980. In 1981, she was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as the first woman to serve as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.[11][12]\n\n\nAfter his mother's appointment, Gorsuch's family moved to Bethesda, Maryland. He enrolled in Georgetown Preparatory School,[13] a selective Jesuit college-preparatory school, arriving as a freshman in 1981.[14] He was two years junior to future justice Brett Kavanaugh, a classmate he later clerked with at the Supreme Court. Gorsuch was a member of Georgetown Prep's debate, forensics, and international relations clubs,[15] and served as a United States Senate page in the early 1980s.[16] He graduated in 1985 as student body president; in contrast to Kavanaugh, he was described as a fairly outgoing and extroverted student.[15][17]\n\n\nGorsuch attended Columbia University after high school, graduating in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts, *cum laude*, in political science. He undertook a heavier courseload to graduate in three years.[18] As an undergraduate, he wrote for the *Columbia Daily Spectator*[19] and co-founded the satirical student publication *The Fed* in 1986.[20][21] Gorsuch distinguished himself as an active debater and an ardent conservative, publishing pieces that criticized left-wing politics. After a brief stint as a writer for a short-lived journal, he led efforts to establish *The Fed* as a conservative alternative to liberal campus newspapers.[18] He was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity[22] and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.[23][18][24]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Columbia, Gorsuch attended Harvard Law School on a Harry S. Truman Scholarship.[25][26] At Harvard, he had been an editor of the *Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy*[27][23] and was a member of the Lincoln's Inn Society, the Harvard Prison Legal Assistance Project, and the Harvard Defenders program.[28][29] Gorsuch was described as a committed conservative who supported the Gulf War and congressional term limits on \"a campus full of ardent liberals\".[30] Despite his contrasting political views, he was generally well-liked by students.[31] Philip C. Berg, a classmate and close friend, remembered him as \"very sensitive\" and non-confrontational, recalling when he received Gorsuch's support in coming out.[28] Gorsuch graduated in 1991 with a Juris Doctor, *cum laude*. Future President Barack Obama was among his classmates.[32]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n### Clerkships[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch served as a law clerk for Judge David B. Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992. After spending a year at Oxford as a Marshall Scholar, Gorsuch clerked for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994.[23][26][33] His work with White occurred right after White retired from the Supreme Court; therefore, Gorsuch assisted White with his work on the Tenth Circuit, where White sat by designation.[23] Gorsuch was part of a group of five law clerks assigned that year that included Brett Kavanaugh, who described Gorsuch at the time, saying: \"He fit into the place very easily. He's just an easy guy to get along with. He doesn't have sharp elbows. We had a wide range of views, but we all really got along well.\"[34]\n\n\n\n### Private law practice[edit]\n\n\nInstead of joining an established law firm, Gorsuch decided to join the two-year-old boutique firm of Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel (now Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick), where he focused on trial work.[12] After winning his first trial as lead attorney, a jury member told Gorsuch he was like Perry Mason.[12] He was an associate in the Washington, D.C., law firm from 1995 to 1997 and a partner from 1998 to 2005.[23][35] Gorsuch's clients included Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz.[36] At Kellogg Huber, Gorsuch focused on commercial matters, including contracts, antitrust, RICO, and securities fraud.[23]\n\n\nIn 2002, Gorsuch wrote an op-ed criticizing the Senate for delaying the nominations of Merrick Garland and John Roberts to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, writing, \"the most impressive judicial nominees are grossly mistreated\" by the Senate.[37]\n\n\nIn 2004, Gorsuch received a Doctor of Philosophy in legal philosophy from the University of Oxford, where he completed research on assisted suicide and euthanasia as a postgraduate student at University College.[38][27][23] A Marshall Scholarship enabled him to study at Oxford in 1992–93, where he was supervised by the natural law philosopher John Finnis.[39] His thesis was also supervised by Canadian legal scholar Timothy Endicott of Balliol College, Oxford.[38][40] In 1996, Gorsuch married Louise, an Englishwoman and champion equestrienne on Oxford's riding team whom he met during his stay there.[12][41]\n\n\nIn 2005, at Kellogg Huber, Gorsuch wrote a brief denouncing class action lawsuits by attorneys on behalf of shareholders. In the case of *Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo*, Gorsuch opined, \"The free ride to fast riches enjoyed by securities class action attorneys in recent years appeared to hit a speed bump\" and \"the problem is that securities fraud litigation imposes an enormous toll on the economy, affecting virtually every public corporation in America at one time or another and costing businesses billions of dollars in settlements every year\".[35]\n\n\n\n### U.S. Department of Justice[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch served as Principal Deputy to the Associate Attorney General, Robert McCallum, at the United States Department of Justice from June 2005 until July 2006.[23][42] As McCallum's principal deputy, he assisted in managing the Department of Justice's civil litigation components, which included the antitrust, civil, civil rights, environment, and tax divisions.[23]\n\n\nWhile managing the United States Department of Justice Civil Division, Gorsuch was tasked with all the \"terror litigation\" arising from the president's War on Terror, successfully defending the extraordinary rendition of Khalid El-Masri, fighting the disclosure of Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse photographs, and, in November 2005, traveling to inspect the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.[43]\n\n\nGorsuch helped Attorney General Alberto Gonzales prepare for hearings after the public revelation of NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07), and worked with Senator Lindsey Graham in drafting the provisions in the Detainee Treatment Act that attempted to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over the detainees.[44]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (2006–2017)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\nIn January 2006, Philip Anschutz recommended Gorsuch's nomination to Colorado's U.S. senator Wayne Allard and White House Counsel Harriet Miers.[36] On May 10, 2006, President George W. Bush nominated Gorsuch to the seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacated by Judge David M. Ebel, who was taking senior status.[27] Like Ebel, Gorsuch was a former clerk of Justice White. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him \"well qualified\" in 2006.[23][45][46]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2006, Gorsuch was confirmed by unanimous voice vote in the U.S. Senate.[47][48] He was Bush's fifth appointment to the Tenth Circuit.[49] When Gorsuch began his tenure at Denver's Byron White United States Courthouse, Justice Kennedy administered the oath of office.[37]\n\n\nDuring his time on the Tenth Circuit, ten of Gorsuch's law clerks went on to become Supreme Court clerks, and he was sometimes regarded as a \"feeder judge\".[50] One of his former clerks, Jonathan Papik, became an associate justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court in 2018.[51]\n\n\n\n### Freedom of religion[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch advocates a broad definition of religious freedom that is inimical to church–state separation advocates.[52][53][54]\n\n\nIn *Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius* (2013), Gorsuch wrote a concurrence when the *en banc* circuit found the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate on a private business violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.[55] That ruling was upheld 5–4 by the Supreme Court in *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.* (2014).[56] When a panel of the court denied similar claims under the same act in *Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell* (2015), Gorsuch joined Judges Harris Hartz, Paul Joseph Kelly Jr., Timothy Tymkovich, and Jerome Holmes in their dissent to the denial of rehearing *en banc*.[57] That ruling was vacated and remanded to the Tenth Circuit by the *per curiam* Supreme Court in *Zubik v. Burwell* (2016).[56]\n\n\nIn *Pleasant Grove City v. Summum* (2007), he joined Judge Michael W. McConnell's dissent from the denial of rehearing *en banc*, taking the view that the government's display of a donated Ten Commandments monument in a public park did not obligate the government to display other offered monuments.[58] The Supreme Court subsequently adopted most of the dissent's view, reversing the Tenth Circuit's judgment.[56] Gorsuch has written, \"the law [...] doesn't just apply to protect popular religious beliefs: it does perhaps its most important work in protecting unpopular religious beliefs, vindicating this nation's long-held aspiration to serve as a refuge of religious tolerance\".[59]\n\n\n\n### Administrative law[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has called for reconsideration of *Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.* (1984), in which the Supreme Court instructed courts to grant deference to federal agencies' interpretation of ambiguous laws and regulations. In *Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch* (2016), Gorsuch wrote for a unanimous panel finding that court review was required before an executive agency could reject the circuit court's interpretation of an immigration law.[60][61]\n\n\nAlone, Gorsuch added a concurring opinion, criticizing *Chevron* deference and *National Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services* (2005) as an \"abdication of judicial duty\" and writing that deference is \"more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design\".[62][63]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Hinckley* (2008), Gorsuch argued that one possible reading of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act likely violates the nondelegation doctrine.[64] Justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg had held the same view in their 2012 dissent in *Reynolds v. United States*.[65]\n\n\n\n### Interstate commerce[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has been an opponent of the dormant Commerce Clause, which allows state laws to be declared unconstitutional if they too greatly burden interstate commerce. In 2011, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that the dormant Commerce Clause did not prevent the Oklahoma Water Resources Board from blocking water exports to Texas.[66] A unanimous Supreme Court affirmed that ruling in *Tarrant Regional Water District v. Herrmann* (2013).[67]\n\n\nIn 2013, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that federal courts could not hear a challenge to Colorado's internet sales tax.[68] A unanimous Supreme Court reversed that ruling in *Direct Marketing Ass'n v. Brohl* (2015).[67] In 2016, the Tenth Circuit panel rejected the challenger's dormant commerce clause claim, with Gorsuch writing a concurrence.[69]\n\n\nIn *Energy and Environmental Legal Institute v. Joshua Epel* (2015), Gorsuch held that Colorado's mandates for renewable energy did not violate the commerce clause by putting out-of-state coal companies at a disadvantage.[70] He wrote that the Colorado renewable energy law \"isn't a price-control statute, it doesn't link prices paid in Colorado with those paid out of state, and it does not discriminate against out-of-staters\".[71][72]\n\n\n\n### Campaign finance[edit]\n\n\nIn *Riddle v. Hickenlooper* (2014), Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel of the Tenth Circuit in finding that it was unconstitutional for a Colorado law to set the limit on donations for write-in candidates at half the amount for major party candidates.[73] He added a concurrence noting that although the standard of review of campaign finance in the United States is unclear, the Colorado law would fail even under intermediate scrutiny.[74]\n\n\n\n### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Planned Parenthood v. Herbert* (2016), Gorsuch wrote for the four dissenting judges when the Tenth Circuit denied a full rehearing of a divided panel opinion that had ordered the Utah governor to resume the organization's funding, which Herbert had blocked in response to a video controversy.[75][76]\n\n\nIn *A.M. v. Holmes* (2016), the Tenth Circuit considered a case in which a 13-year-old child was arrested for burping and laughing in gym class. The child was handcuffed and arrested based on a New Mexico statute that makes it a misdemeanor to disrupt school activities. The child's family brought a federal § 1983 civil rights action against school officials and the school resource officer who made the arrest, arguing that it was a false arrest that violated the child's constitutional rights. In a 94-page majority opinion, the Tenth Circuit held that the defendants enjoyed qualified immunity from suit.[77] Gorsuch wrote a four-page dissent, arguing that the New Mexico Court of Appeals had \"long ago alerted law enforcement\" that the statute that the officer relied upon for the child's arrest does not criminalize noises or diversions that merely disturb order in a classroom.[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n### Criminal law[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Gorsuch wrote for a unanimous panel finding that a court may still order criminals to pay restitution even after it missed a statutory deadline.[80] The Supreme Court affirmed that ruling 5–4 in *Dolan v. United States* (2010).[67]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Games-Perez* (2012), Gorsuch ruled on a case where a felon owned a gun in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), but alleged that he did not know that he was a felon at the time. Gorsuch joined the majority in upholding the conviction based on Tenth Circuit precedent, but filed a concurring opinion arguing that said precedent was wrongly decided: \"The only statutory element separating innocent (even constitutionally protected) gun possession from criminal conduct in §§ 922(g) and 924(a) is a prior felony conviction. So the presumption that the government must prove mens rea here applies with full force.\"[81] In the 2019 case *Rehaif v. United States*, the Supreme Court overruled this decision, with Gorsuch joining.\n\n\nIn 2013, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that intent does not need to be proven under a bank fraud statute.[82] A unanimous Supreme Court affirmed that ruling in *Loughrin v. United States* (2014).[67] In 2015, Gorsuch wrote a dissent to the denial of rehearing *en banc* when the Tenth Circuit found that a convicted sex offender had to register with Kansas after he moved to the Philippines.[83] A unanimous Supreme Court reversed the Tenth Circuit in *Nichols v. United States* (2016).[67]\n\n\n\n### Death penalty[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch favors a strict reading of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).[56] In 2015, he wrote for the court when it permitted Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to order the execution of Scott Eizember, prompting a 30-page dissent by Judge Mary Beck Briscoe.[84][85] After the state's unsuccessful execution of Clayton Lockett, Gorsuch joined Briscoe when the court unanimously allowed Pruitt to continue using the same lethal injection protocol. The Supreme Court upheld that ruling 5–4 in *Glossip v. Gross* (2015).[86]\n\n\n\n### List of judicial opinions[edit]\n\n\nDuring his tenure on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, Gorsuch authored 212 published opinions.[87] Some of those are:\n\n\n\n* *United States v.

Obama had nominated Garland on March 16, 2016, but Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley did not schedule a hearing for him, leaving Garland's nomination to expire on January 3, 2017.[93] Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell invoked the so-called \"Biden Rule\" (of 1992) to justify the Senate's refusal to consider Garland's nomination in a general election year.[94][95][96]\n\n\nTrump formally transmitted his nomination to the Senate on February 1, 2017.[97] The American Bar Association unanimously gave Gorsuch its top rating—\"Well Qualified\"—to serve as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.[98] His confirmation hearing before the Senate started on March 20, 2017.[99]\n\n\nOn April 3, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved his nomination with a party-line 11–9 vote.[100] On April 6, 2017, Democrats filibustered (prevented cloture) the confirmation vote, after which Republicans invoked the \"nuclear option\", allowing a filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee to be broken by a simple majority vote.[101]\n\n\nOn April 4, BuzzFeed and *Politico* ran articles highlighting similar language occurring in Gorsuch's book *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia* and an earlier law review article by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma, Indiana's deputy attorney general. Academic experts contacted by *Politico* \"differed in their assessment of what Gorsuch did, ranging from calling it a clear impropriety to mere sloppiness.\"[102][103][104][105]\n\n\nJohn Finnis, who supervised Gorsuch's dissertation at Oxford, said, \"The allegation is entirely without foundation. The book is meticulous in its citation of primary sources. The allegation that the book is guilty of plagiarism because it does not cite secondary sources which draw on those same primary sources is, frankly, absurd.\" Kuzma said, \"I have reviewed both passages and do not see an issue here, even though the language is similar. These passages are factual, not analytical in nature, framing both the technical legal and medical circumstances of the 'Baby/Infant Doe' case that occurred in 1982.\"[103] In his book on Gorsuch, John Greenya described how Gorsuch was challenged during his confirmation hearings concerning some of his dissertation advisor's more strident views, which Gorsuch generally disagreed with.[106]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2017, the Senate confirmed Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court by a 54–45 vote, with three Democrats (Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Manchin, and Joe Donnelly) joining all Republicans in attendance.[107]\n\n\nGorsuch received his commission on April 8, 2017.[108] He was sworn into office on Monday, April 10, 2017, in two ceremonies. The chief justice of the United States administered the constitutional oath of office in a private ceremony at 9 a.m. at the Supreme Court, making Gorsuch the 101st associate justice of the Court. At 11 a.m., Justice Kennedy administered the judicial oath of office in a public ceremony at the White House Rose Garden.[109][110][111]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2017–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Banking regulation[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch wrote his first U.S. Supreme Court decision for a unanimous court in *Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc.*, 582 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2017). The Court ruled against the borrowers, holding that Santander in this case was not a debt collector under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act since it purchased the original defaulted car loans from CitiFinancial for pennies on the dollar, making Santander the owner of the debts and not merely an agent.[112] When the act was enacted, regulations were put on institutions that collected other companies' debts, but the act left unaddressed businesses collecting their own debts.[113][114]\n\n\n\n### First Amendment[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch joined the majority in *National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra* and *Janus v. AFSCME*, which both held unconstitutional certain forms of compelled speech.[115][116]\n\n\nGorsuch authored the majority opinion in *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* (2022), which concerned a public high school football coach who was fired for praying on the field after games. The opinion held that the coach's conduct was protected by both the Free Speech and Free Exercise clauses of the First Amendment, and that the school's attempt to stop him was not mandated by the amendment's Establishment Clause.[117]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, in *Pavan v. Smith*, the Supreme Court \"summarily overruled\" the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision to deny same-sex married parents the same right to appear on the birth certificate.[118] Gorsuch wrote a dissent, joined by Thomas and Alito, arguing that the Court should have fully heard the arguments of the case.[119]\n\n\nIn 2020, Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion in the combined cases of *Bostock v. Clayton County*, *Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda*, and *R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission*, ruling that businesses cannot discriminate in employment against LGBTQ people. He argued that discrimination based on sexual orientation was illegal discrimination on the basis of sex, because the employer would be discriminating \"for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex\".[120] The ruling was 6–3, with Gorsuch joined by Chief Justice Roberts and the Court's four Democratic appointees.[121][122] Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh dissented from the decision, arguing that it improperly extended the Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity.[123]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Gorsuch agreed with the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to deny an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[124] In June 2021, he joined the justices in the unanimous Fulton v. City of Philadelphia decision, ruling in favor of a Catholic adoption agency that had been denied a contract by the City of Philadelphia due to the agency's refusal to adopt to same-sex couples.[125] Gorsuch and Thomas joined Alito's concurrence, which argued for reconsidering, possibly overturning, *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[126] Also in 2021, Gorsuch was one of three justices, with Thomas and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington State florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[127][128][129] In November 2021, Gorsuch dissented from the Court's 6–3 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[130] The decision to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor; Thomas and Alito also dissented.[131][132]\n\n\n\n### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2019\nGorsuch joined Thomas's dissent from denial of certiorari in *Peruta v. San Diego County*, in which the Ninth Circuit had upheld California's restrictive concealed carry laws.[133]\n\n\nGorsuch wrote a statement regarding the denial of an application for a stay presented to Roberts in *Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives*, a 2019 D.C. Circuit case challenging the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks. In his statement Gorsuch criticized the Trump Administration's action as well as the justification the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit used for upholding the ban.[134][135]\n\n\n\n### Vagueness doctrine[edit]\n\n\nIn *Sessions v. Dimaya* (2018), the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 to uphold the Ninth Circuit's decision that the residual clause in the Immigration and Nationality Act was unconstitutionally vague. Gorsuch joined Justices Kagan, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor in the opinion, and wrote a separate concurrence reiterating the importance of the vagueness doctrine within Scalia's 2015 opinion in *Johnson*.[136] In *United States v. Davis* (2019), Gorsuch wrote the Opinion of the Court striking down the residual clause of the Hobbs Act based on the rationale used in *Dimaya*.[137][138]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Gorsuch dissented when the Court voted against hearing cases brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.[139] He and Alito joined Thomas's dissent arguing that it was the Court's job to hear the case.[140]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Gorsuch sided with three of the Court's other conservative justices, rejecting a stay to temporarily block a law restricting abortion in Louisiana.[141] The law that the court temporarily stayed, in a 5–4 decision, would require that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a hospital.[142] In June 2020, the Supreme Court struck down Louisiana's abortion restriction in *June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo*, a 5–4 decision; Gorsuch was among the four dissenters.[143][144] In September 2021, the Supreme Court declined a petition to block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks; the vote was 5–4 with Gorsuch in the majority, joined by Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett.[145]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Gorsuch was among the five justices who formed the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, which ruled there is no constitutional right to abortion, overruling *Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[146]\n\n\n\n### Native American law[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch is regarded as an authority on American Indian law.[147] During his time on the Supreme Court, he has frequently affirmed tribal rights; his appointment to the Court was supported by multiple tribes and Native American organizations due to his favorable rulings as a Tenth Circuit judge.[148][149]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Gorsuch joined the four liberal justices (in two plurality opinions) in a 5–4 majority in *Washington State Dept. of Licensing v. Cougar Den, Inc.*[150] The Court's decision sided with the Yakama Nation, striking down a Washington state tax on transporting gasoline, on the basis of an 1855 treaty in which the Yakama ceded a large portion of Washington in exchange for certain rights.[151] In his concurrence, which was joined by Ginsburg, Gorsuch ended his opinion by writing: \"Really, this case just tells an old and familiar story. The State of Washington includes millions of acres that the Yakamas ceded to the United States under significant pressure. In return, the government supplied a handful of modest promises. The state is now dissatisfied with the consequences of one of those promises. It is a new day, and now it wants more. But today and to its credit, the Court holds the parties to the terms of their deal. It is the least we can do.\"[152]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Gorsuch again joined the four more liberal justices in a decision favorable to Native Americans' treaty rights, signing on to Justice Sotomayor's opinion to reach a 5–4 decision in *Herrera v. Wyoming*. The case held that hunting rights in Montana and Wyoming, granted by the U.S. government to the Native American Crow people by an 1868 treaty, were not extinguished by the 1890 grant of statehood to Wyoming.[153]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Gorsuch again joined the liberal justices to make a 5–4 majority in *McGirt v. Oklahoma*. The case considered whether much of eastern Oklahoma still remained under the jurisdiction of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\", given that the Native American Treaties that had designated the region as under their reservation status had never been dissolved by Congress, and, if so, whether crimes committed by Native Americans against other Native Americans on tribal land were under the jurisdiction of Native Courts.[154] The landmark decision in the affirmative, written by Gorsuch, found that \"For Major Crimes Act purposes, land reserved for the Creek Nation since the 19th century remains 'Indian country.'\"[155][156] In the opinion, he wrote: \"Today we are asked whether the land these treaties promised remains an Indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law. Because Congress has not said otherwise, we hold the government to its word.\"[156] The case was later reviewed in the June 2022 case Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, which considered whether non-Natives who committed crimes against Natives on Native American territory can be charged under the sole jurisdiction of Native American tribal courts.[157][158] While the state of Oklahoma had initially argued for the overturning of *McGirt*, the Court agreed to hear only issues relating to the impacts of *McGirt*.[159] The 5-4 decision by Justice Brett Kavanaugh opposed the more expanded viewpoint of non-Native criminal jurisdiction, with the opinion giving jurisdiction over such crimes to both tribal and federal/state governments. Gorsuch derided the opinion in his dissent, writing, \"Where this Court once stood firm, today it wilts.\"[160][161]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2022, Gorsuch, Barrett, and the three liberal justices ruled in favor of the Native American Tribes of Texas in the case *Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas*. The case concerned a dispute over whether Texas could control and regulate gambling on Texan Native American reservations. The initial conflict had developed from the tribes' having been in a trust with Texas from 1968 to 1987 before being granted a federal trust, resulting in a statute governing the tribes' subjugation to Texas's gambling restrictions.[162] The ruling emphasized that the tribes have the power to regulate electronic bingo games on their land regardless of the state's prohibition of non-prohibited gambling. Thus, as long as a game is not outright prohibited by the state of Texas, the state government cannot impose regulations upon tribal games. Gorsuch emphasized in his opinion that \"None of this is to say that the Tribe may offer gaming on whatever terms it wishes [...] Other gaming activities are subject to tribal regulation and must conform to the terms and conditions set forth in federal law.\"[163]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 restrictions[edit]\n\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Gorsuch joined the majority opinion in *Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo*, which struck down COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the state of New York on houses of worship.[164]\n\n\nOn May 18, 2023, Gorsuch issued a statement about the Court's decision to dismiss a lawsuit by several states aimed at continuing Title 42 expulsions of immigrants, a policy instituted to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 cases to the United States. His statement criticized many of the restrictions the government had imposed since the pandemic started and said, \"Since March 2020, we may have experienced the greatest intrusions on civil liberties in the peacetime history of this country.\"[165]\n\n\n\n## Legal philosophy[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch is a proponent of originalism, the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted as perceived at the time of enactment, and of textualism, the idea that statutes should be interpreted literally, without considering the legislative history and underlying purpose of the law.[2][3][4] An editorial in the *National Catholic Register* opined that Gorsuch's judicial decisions lean more toward natural law philosophy.[166]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Bonnie Kristian of *The Week* wrote that an \"unexpected civil libertarian alliance\" was developing between Gorsuch and Sotomayor \"in defense of robust due process rights and skepticism of law enforcement overreach.\"[167]\n\n\n\n### Voting alignment[edit]\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight used Lee Epstein et al.'s Judicial Common Space scores[168] (which are not based on a judge's behavior, but rather the ideology scores of either home state senators or the appointing president) to find a close alignment between the conservatism of other appellate and Supreme Court judges such as Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito.[169] *The Washington Post*'s statistical analysis estimated that the ideologies of most of Trump's announced candidates were \"statistically indistinguishable\" and also associated Gorsuch with Kavanaugh and Alito.[170]\n\n\n\n### Judicial activism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch in 2019\nIn a 2016 speech at Case Western Reserve University, Gorsuch said that judges should strive to apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be—not to decide cases based on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they believe might serve society best.[171]\n\n\nIn a 2005 *National Review* article, Gorsuch argued that \"American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda\" and that they are \"failing to reach out and persuade the public\". He wrote that, in doing so, American liberals are circumventing the democratic process on issues like gay marriage, school vouchers, and assisted suicide, and this has led to a compromised judiciary, which is no longer independent. Gorsuch wrote that American liberals' \"overweening addiction\" to using the courts for social debate is \"bad for the nation and bad for the judiciary\".[47][172]\n\n\n\n### Federalism and state power[edit]\n\n\nJustin Marceau, a professor at the University of Denver's Sturm College of Law, called Gorsuch \"a predictably socially conservative judge who tends to favor state power over federal power\". Marceau added that this is important because federal laws have been used to try to reel in \"rogue\" state laws in civil rights cases.[173]\n\n\n\n### Assisted suicide[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2006, Gorsuch's book *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia*, developed from his doctoral thesis, was published by Princeton University Press.[38][174][175][176] In the book, Gorsuch makes clear his personal opposition to euthanasia and assisted suicide, arguing that the U.S. should \"retain existing law [banning assisted suicide and euthanasia] on the basis that human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable, and that the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong.\"[59][175][177]\n\n\n\n### Statutory interpretation[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has been considered to follow in Scalia's footsteps as a textualist in statutory interpretation of the plain meaning of the law.[178][179] This was exemplified in his majority opinion in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, 590 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2020), which ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 grants protection from employment discrimination due to sexual orientation and gender identity. Gorsuch wrote in the decision, \"An employer who fired an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\"[180][181][182]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch and family with Donald Trump, Anthony Kennedy, and Mike Pence prior to his swearing-in\nGorsuch and his wife, Marie Louise Gorsuch,[183] a British citizen, met at Oxford. The two married at St. Nicholas' Anglican Church in Henley-on-Thames in 1996.[184][185] They live in Boulder, Colorado, and have two daughters.[186][187][188]\n\n\nGorsuch enjoys the outdoors and fly fishing; he went fly fishing on at least one occasion with Justice Scalia.[10][189] He raises horses, chickens, and goats, and often arranges ski trips with colleagues and friends.[56]\n\n\nHe has authored two nonfiction books. The first, *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia*, was published by Princeton University Press in July 2006.[190] He is a co-author of *The Law of Judicial Precedent*, published by Thomson West in 2016.[35]\n\n\nIn 2017, after his announcement as a Supreme Court nominee, *the New York Times* reported that Gorsuch owned a timeshare outside Granby, Colorado, with associates of Philip Anschutz, that was later sold the same year.[36] Reporting from *Politico* in April 2023 revealed that Gorsuch had sold the cabin to Brian Duffy, the CEO of the law firm Greenberg Traurig, which litigates cases before the Supreme Court, but failed to disclose the purchaser's identity on his federal disclosure forms.[191] The property was listed for sale for a few years but did not go under contract until the week after Gorsuch joined the Supreme Court.[191][192] Since 2017, Greenberg Traurig has been involved in at least 22 cases before or presented to the Supreme Court.[191][193]\n\n\nGorsuch has been active in several professional associations throughout his legal career,[23] including the American Bar Association, the American Trial Lawyers Association, Phi Beta Kappa, the Republican National Lawyers Association, and the New York, Colorado, and District of Columbia Bar Associations.[23] In May 2019, it was announced that Gorsuch would become the new chairman of the board of the National Constitution Center, succeeding former vice president Joe Biden.[194]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch was the first member of a mainline Protestant denomination to sit on the Supreme Court since the retirement of John Paul Stevens in 2010.[195][196][197] He and his two siblings were raised Catholic and attended weekly Mass.[198][186] His wife, Louise, is British-born; the two met while Neil was studying at Oxford. Louise was raised in the Church of England.[199]\n\n\nWhen the couple returned to the United States they joined Holy Comforter, an Episcopal parish in Vienna, Virginia, attending weekly services. Gorsuch volunteered there as an usher.[197] The Gorsuch family later attended St. John's Episcopal Church in Boulder, Colorado, a liberal church with a longstanding open-door policy for the LGBT community.[91][200][201] During his 2017 confirmation hearing, responding to a senator's question about his faith, Gorsuch replied, \"I attend an Episcopal church in Boulder with my family, senator.\"[202][203][204] After marrying in a non-Catholic ceremony and joining an Episcopal church, Gorsuch has not publicly clarified his religious affiliation.[199]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch received the Edward J. Randolph Award for outstanding service to the Department of Justice and the Harry S. Truman Foundation's Stevens Award for outstanding public service in the field of law.[188]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* Gorsuch, Neil (2004). *The right to receive assistance in suicide and euthanasia, with particular reference to the law of the United States* (DPhil thesis).

He was nominated by President Donald Trump on January 31, 2017, and has served since April 10, 2017.\n\n\nGorsuch spent his early life in Denver, Colorado, then lived in Bethesda, Maryland, while attending Georgetown Preparatory School. Upon graduating, he matriculated at Columbia University, where he became an established writer. Gorsuch received his legal education at Harvard Law School and in 1993, after 15 years as a practicing attorney, obtained a Doctor of Philosophy in jurisprudence from the University of Oxford on a Marshall Scholarship. His doctoral thesis concerned the morality of assisted suicide and was written under the supervision of legal philosopher John Finnis.\n\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Gorsuch was in private practice with the law firm of Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick. He was the principal deputy associate attorney general at the United States Department of Justice from 2005 until his appointment to the Tenth Circuit. President George W. Bush nominated Gorsuch to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on May 10, 2006, to replace Judge David M. Ebel, who achieved senior status that same year.\n\n\nGorsuch is a proponent of textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in interpreting the United States Constitution.[2][3][4] Along with Justice Clarence Thomas, he is an advocate of natural law jurisprudence.[5] Gorsuch clerked for Judge David B. Sentelle of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992 and U.S. Supreme Court justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994. He is the first Supreme Court justice to serve alongside a justice for whom he once clerked (Kennedy).[6] During his tenure on the Supreme Court he has written the majority opinion in landmark cases such as *Bostock v. Clayton County* on LGBT rights, *McGirt v. Oklahoma* on Native American law, *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* on personal religious observance, *303 Creative LLC v. Elenis* on free speech, and *Ramos v. Louisiana* on juries' guilty verdicts.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch was born on August 29, 1967, in Denver, Colorado, to Anne Gorsuch Burford (née McGill; 1942–2004) and David Ronald Gorsuch (1937–2001).[7][8] He was the eldest of three children,[9] and is a fourth-generation Coloradan.[10] Both of Gorsuch's parents were lawyers, and his mother served in the Colorado House of Representatives from 1976 to 1980. In 1981, she was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as the first woman to serve as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.[11][12]\n\n\nAfter his mother's appointment, Gorsuch's family moved to Bethesda, Maryland. He enrolled in Georgetown Preparatory School,[13] a selective Jesuit college-preparatory school, arriving as a freshman in 1981.[14] He was two years junior to future justice Brett Kavanaugh, a classmate he later clerked with at the Supreme Court. Gorsuch was a member of Georgetown Prep's debate, forensics, and international relations clubs,[15] and served as a United States Senate page in the early 1980s.[16] He graduated in 1985 as student body president; in contrast to Kavanaugh, he was described as a fairly outgoing and extroverted student.[15][17]\n\n\nGorsuch attended Columbia University after high school, graduating in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts, *cum laude*, in political science. He undertook a heavier courseload to graduate in three years.[18] As an undergraduate, he wrote for the *Columbia Daily Spectator*[19] and co-founded the satirical student publication *The Fed* in 1986.[20][21] Gorsuch distinguished himself as an active debater and an ardent conservative, publishing pieces that criticized left-wing politics. After a brief stint as a writer for a short-lived journal, he led efforts to establish *The Fed* as a conservative alternative to liberal campus newspapers.[18] He was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity[22] and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.[23][18][24]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Columbia, Gorsuch attended Harvard Law School on a Harry S. Truman Scholarship.[25][26] At Harvard, he had been an editor of the *Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy*[27][23] and was a member of the Lincoln's Inn Society, the Harvard Prison Legal Assistance Project, and the Harvard Defenders program.[28][29] Gorsuch was described as a committed conservative who supported the Gulf War and congressional term limits on \"a campus full of ardent liberals\".[30] Despite his contrasting political views, he was generally well-liked by students.[31] Philip C. Berg, a classmate and close friend, remembered him as \"very sensitive\" and non-confrontational, recalling when he received Gorsuch's support in coming out.[28] Gorsuch graduated in 1991 with a Juris Doctor, *cum laude*. Future President Barack Obama was among his classmates.[32]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n### Clerkships[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch served as a law clerk for Judge David B. Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992. After spending a year at Oxford as a Marshall Scholar, Gorsuch clerked for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994.[23][26][33] His work with White occurred right after White retired from the Supreme Court; therefore, Gorsuch assisted White with his work on the Tenth Circuit, where White sat by designation.[23] Gorsuch was part of a group of five law clerks assigned that year that included Brett Kavanaugh, who described Gorsuch at the time, saying: \"He fit into the place very easily. He's just an easy guy to get along with. He doesn't have sharp elbows. We had a wide range of views, but we all really got along well.\"[34]\n\n\n\n### Private law practice[edit]\n\n\nInstead of joining an established law firm, Gorsuch decided to join the two-year-old boutique firm of Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel (now Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick), where he focused on trial work.[12] After winning his first trial as lead attorney, a jury member told Gorsuch he was like Perry Mason.[12] He was an associate in the Washington, D.C., law firm from 1995 to 1997 and a partner from 1998 to 2005.[23][35] Gorsuch's clients included Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz.[36] At Kellogg Huber, Gorsuch focused on commercial matters, including contracts, antitrust, RICO, and securities fraud.[23]\n\n\nIn 2002, Gorsuch wrote an op-ed criticizing the Senate for delaying the nominations of Merrick Garland and John Roberts to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, writing, \"the most impressive judicial nominees are grossly mistreated\" by the Senate.[37]\n\n\nIn 2004, Gorsuch received a Doctor of Philosophy in legal philosophy from the University of Oxford, where he completed research on assisted suicide and euthanasia as a postgraduate student at University College.[38][27][23] A Marshall Scholarship enabled him to study at Oxford in 1992–93, where he was supervised by the natural law philosopher John Finnis.[39] His thesis was also supervised by Canadian legal scholar Timothy Endicott of Balliol College, Oxford.[38][40] In 1996, Gorsuch married Louise, an Englishwoman and champion equestrienne on Oxford's riding team whom he met during his stay there.[12][41]\n\n\nIn 2005, at Kellogg Huber, Gorsuch wrote a brief denouncing class action lawsuits by attorneys on behalf of shareholders. In the case of *Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo*, Gorsuch opined, \"The free ride to fast riches enjoyed by securities class action attorneys in recent years appeared to hit a speed bump\" and \"the problem is that securities fraud litigation imposes an enormous toll on the economy, affecting virtually every public corporation in America at one time or another and costing businesses billions of dollars in settlements every year\".[35]\n\n\n\n### U.S. Department of Justice[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch served as Principal Deputy to the Associate Attorney General, Robert McCallum, at the United States Department of Justice from June 2005 until July 2006.[23][42] As McCallum's principal deputy, he assisted in managing the Department of Justice's civil litigation components, which included the antitrust, civil, civil rights, environment, and tax divisions.[23]\n\n\nWhile managing the United States Department of Justice Civil Division, Gorsuch was tasked with all the \"terror litigation\" arising from the president's War on Terror, successfully defending the extraordinary rendition of Khalid El-Masri, fighting the disclosure of Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse photographs, and, in November 2005, traveling to inspect the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.[43]\n\n\nGorsuch helped Attorney General Alberto Gonzales prepare for hearings after the public revelation of NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07), and worked with Senator Lindsey Graham in drafting the provisions in the Detainee Treatment Act that attempted to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over the detainees.[44]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (2006–2017)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\nIn January 2006, Philip Anschutz recommended Gorsuch's nomination to Colorado's U.S. senator Wayne Allard and White House Counsel Harriet Miers.[36] On May 10, 2006, President George W. Bush nominated Gorsuch to the seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacated by Judge David M. Ebel, who was taking senior status.[27] Like Ebel, Gorsuch was a former clerk of Justice White. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him \"well qualified\" in 2006.[23][45][46]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2006, Gorsuch was confirmed by unanimous voice vote in the U.S. Senate.[47][48] He was Bush's fifth appointment to the Tenth Circuit.[49] When Gorsuch began his tenure at Denver's Byron White United States Courthouse, Justice Kennedy administered the oath of office.[37]\n\n\nDuring his time on the Tenth Circuit, ten of Gorsuch's law clerks went on to become Supreme Court clerks, and he was sometimes regarded as a \"feeder judge\".[50] One of his former clerks, Jonathan Papik, became an associate justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court in 2018.[51]\n\n\n\n### Freedom of religion[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch advocates a broad definition of religious freedom that is inimical to church–state separation advocates.[52][53][54]\n\n\nIn *Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius* (2013), Gorsuch wrote a concurrence when the *en banc* circuit found the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate on a private business violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.[55] That ruling was upheld 5–4 by the Supreme Court in *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.* (2014).[56] When a panel of the court denied similar claims under the same act in *Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell* (2015), Gorsuch joined Judges Harris Hartz, Paul Joseph Kelly Jr., Timothy Tymkovich, and Jerome Holmes in their dissent to the denial of rehearing *en banc*.[57] That ruling was vacated and remanded to the Tenth Circuit by the *per curiam* Supreme Court in *Zubik v. Burwell* (2016).[56]\n\n\nIn *Pleasant Grove City v. Summum* (2007), he joined Judge Michael W. McConnell's dissent from the denial of rehearing *en banc*, taking the view that the government's display of a donated Ten Commandments monument in a public park did not obligate the government to display other offered monuments.[58] The Supreme Court subsequently adopted most of the dissent's view, reversing the Tenth Circuit's judgment.[56] Gorsuch has written, \"the law [...] doesn't just apply to protect popular religious beliefs: it does perhaps its most important work in protecting unpopular religious beliefs, vindicating this nation's long-held aspiration to serve as a refuge of religious tolerance\".[59]\n\n\n\n### Administrative law[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has called for reconsideration of *Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.* (1984), in which the Supreme Court instructed courts to grant deference to federal agencies' interpretation of ambiguous laws and regulations. In *Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch* (2016), Gorsuch wrote for a unanimous panel finding that court review was required before an executive agency could reject the circuit court's interpretation of an immigration law.[60][61]\n\n\nAlone, Gorsuch added a concurring opinion, criticizing *Chevron* deference and *National Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services* (2005) as an \"abdication of judicial duty\" and writing that deference is \"more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design\".[62][63]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Hinckley* (2008), Gorsuch argued that one possible reading of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act likely violates the nondelegation doctrine.[64] Justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg had held the same view in their 2012 dissent in *Reynolds v. United States*.[65]\n\n\n\n### Interstate commerce[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has been an opponent of the dormant Commerce Clause, which allows state laws to be declared unconstitutional if they too greatly burden interstate commerce. In 2011, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that the dormant Commerce Clause did not prevent the Oklahoma Water Resources Board from blocking water exports to Texas.[66] A unanimous Supreme Court affirmed that ruling in *Tarrant Regional Water District v. Herrmann* (2013).[67]\n\n\nIn 2013, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that federal courts could not hear a challenge to Colorado's internet sales tax.[68] A unanimous Supreme Court reversed that ruling in *Direct Marketing Ass'n v. Brohl* (2015).[67] In 2016, the Tenth Circuit panel rejected the challenger's dormant commerce clause claim, with Gorsuch writing a concurrence.[69]\n\n\nIn *Energy and Environmental Legal Institute v. Joshua Epel* (2015), Gorsuch held that Colorado's mandates for renewable energy did not violate the commerce clause by putting out-of-state coal companies at a disadvantage.[70] He wrote that the Colorado renewable energy law \"isn't a price-control statute, it doesn't link prices paid in Colorado with those paid out of state, and it does not discriminate against out-of-staters\".[71][72]\n\n\n\n### Campaign finance[edit]\n\n\nIn *Riddle v. Hickenlooper* (2014), Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel of the Tenth Circuit in finding that it was unconstitutional for a Colorado law to set the limit on donations for write-in candidates at half the amount for major party candidates.[73] He added a concurrence noting that although the standard of review of campaign finance in the United States is unclear, the Colorado law would fail even under intermediate scrutiny.[74]\n\n\n\n### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Planned Parenthood v. Herbert* (2016), Gorsuch wrote for the four dissenting judges when the Tenth Circuit denied a full rehearing of a divided panel opinion that had ordered the Utah governor to resume the organization's funding, which Herbert had blocked in response to a video controversy.[75][76]\n\n\nIn *A.M. v. Holmes* (2016), the Tenth Circuit considered a case in which a 13-year-old child was arrested for burping and laughing in gym class. The child was handcuffed and arrested based on a New Mexico statute that makes it a misdemeanor to disrupt school activities. The child's family brought a federal § 1983 civil rights action against school officials and the school resource officer who made the arrest, arguing that it was a false arrest that violated the child's constitutional rights. In a 94-page majority opinion, the Tenth Circuit held that the defendants enjoyed qualified immunity from suit.[77] Gorsuch wrote a four-page dissent, arguing that the New Mexico Court of Appeals had \"long ago alerted law enforcement\" that the statute that the officer relied upon for the child's arrest does not criminalize noises or diversions that merely disturb order in a classroom.[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n### Criminal law[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Gorsuch wrote for a unanimous panel finding that a court may still order criminals to pay restitution even after it missed a statutory deadline.[80] The Supreme Court affirmed that ruling 5–4 in *Dolan v. United States* (2010).[67]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Games-Perez* (2012), Gorsuch ruled on a case where a felon owned a gun in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), but alleged that he did not know that he was a felon at the time. Gorsuch joined the majority in upholding the conviction based on Tenth Circuit precedent, but filed a concurring opinion arguing that said precedent was wrongly decided: \"The only statutory element separating innocent (even constitutionally protected) gun possession from criminal conduct in §§ 922(g) and 924(a) is a prior felony conviction. So the presumption that the government must prove mens rea here applies with full force.\"[81] In the 2019 case *Rehaif v. United States*, the Supreme Court overruled this decision, with Gorsuch joining.\n\n\nIn 2013, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that intent does not need to be proven under a bank fraud statute.[82] A unanimous Supreme Court affirmed that ruling in *Loughrin v. United States* (2014).[67] In 2015, Gorsuch wrote a dissent to the denial of rehearing *en banc* when the Tenth Circuit found that a convicted sex offender had to register with Kansas after he moved to the Philippines.[83] A unanimous Supreme Court reversed the Tenth Circuit in *Nichols v. United States* (2016).[67]\n\n\n\n### Death penalty[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch favors a strict reading of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).[56] In 2015, he wrote for the court when it permitted Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to order the execution of Scott Eizember, prompting a 30-page dissent by Judge Mary Beck Briscoe.[84][85] After the state's unsuccessful execution of Clayton Lockett, Gorsuch joined Briscoe when the court unanimously allowed Pruitt to continue using the same lethal injection protocol. The Supreme Court upheld that ruling 5–4 in *Glossip v. Gross* (2015).[86]\n\n\n\n### List of judicial opinions[edit]\n\n\nDuring his tenure on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, Gorsuch authored 212 published opinions.[87] Some of those are:\n\n\n\n* *United States v. Hinckley*, 550 F. 3d 926 (2008), on principles of interpretation and construction of a statute, according to plain meaning and context\n* *United States v.

Obama had nominated Garland on March 16, 2016, but Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley did not schedule a hearing for him, leaving Garland's nomination to expire on January 3, 2017.[93] Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell invoked the so-called \"Biden Rule\" (of 1992) to justify the Senate's refusal to consider Garland's nomination in a general election year.[94][95][96]\n\n\nTrump formally transmitted his nomination to the Senate on February 1, 2017.[97] The American Bar Association unanimously gave Gorsuch its top rating—\"Well Qualified\"—to serve as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.[98] His confirmation hearing before the Senate started on March 20, 2017.[99]\n\n\nOn April 3, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved his nomination with a party-line 11–9 vote.[100] On April 6, 2017, Democrats filibustered (prevented cloture) the confirmation vote, after which Republicans invoked the \"nuclear option\", allowing a filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee to be broken by a simple majority vote.[101]\n\n\nOn April 4, BuzzFeed and *Politico* ran articles highlighting similar language occurring in Gorsuch's book *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia* and an earlier law review article by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma, Indiana's deputy attorney general. Academic experts contacted by *Politico* \"differed in their assessment of what Gorsuch did, ranging from calling it a clear impropriety to mere sloppiness.\"[102][103][104][105]\n\n\nJohn Finnis, who supervised Gorsuch's dissertation at Oxford, said, \"The allegation is entirely without foundation. The book is meticulous in its citation of primary sources. The allegation that the book is guilty of plagiarism because it does not cite secondary sources which draw on those same primary sources is, frankly, absurd.\" Kuzma said, \"I have reviewed both passages and do not see an issue here, even though the language is similar. These passages are factual, not analytical in nature, framing both the technical legal and medical circumstances of the 'Baby/Infant Doe' case that occurred in 1982.\"[103] In his book on Gorsuch, John Greenya described how Gorsuch was challenged during his confirmation hearings concerning some of his dissertation advisor's more strident views, which Gorsuch generally disagreed with.[106]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2017, the Senate confirmed Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court by a 54–45 vote, with three Democrats (Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Manchin, and Joe Donnelly) joining all Republicans in attendance.[107]\n\n\nGorsuch received his commission on April 8, 2017.[108] He was sworn into office on Monday, April 10, 2017, in two ceremonies. The chief justice of the United States administered the constitutional oath of office in a private ceremony at 9 a.m. at the Supreme Court, making Gorsuch the 101st associate justice of the Court. At 11 a.m., Justice Kennedy administered the judicial oath of office in a public ceremony at the White House Rose Garden.[109][110][111]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2017–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Banking regulation[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch wrote his first U.S. Supreme Court decision for a unanimous court in *Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc.*, 582 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2017). The Court ruled against the borrowers, holding that Santander in this case was not a debt collector under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act since it purchased the original defaulted car loans from CitiFinancial for pennies on the dollar, making Santander the owner of the debts and not merely an agent.[112] When the act was enacted, regulations were put on institutions that collected other companies' debts, but the act left unaddressed businesses collecting their own debts.[113][114]\n\n\n\n### First Amendment[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch joined the majority in *National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra* and *Janus v. AFSCME*, which both held unconstitutional certain forms of compelled speech.[115][116]\n\n\nGorsuch authored the majority opinion in *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* (2022), which concerned a public high school football coach who was fired for praying on the field after games. The opinion held that the coach's conduct was protected by both the Free Speech and Free Exercise clauses of the First Amendment, and that the school's attempt to stop him was not mandated by the amendment's Establishment Clause.[117]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, in *Pavan v. Smith*, the Supreme Court \"summarily overruled\" the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision to deny same-sex married parents the same right to appear on the birth certificate.[118] Gorsuch wrote a dissent, joined by Thomas and Alito, arguing that the Court should have fully heard the arguments of the case.[119]\n\n\nIn 2020, Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion in the combined cases of *Bostock v. Clayton County*, *Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda*, and *R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission*, ruling that businesses cannot discriminate in employment against LGBTQ people. He argued that discrimination based on sexual orientation was illegal discrimination on the basis of sex, because the employer would be discriminating \"for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex\".[120] The ruling was 6–3, with Gorsuch joined by Chief Justice Roberts and the Court's four Democratic appointees.[121][122] Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh dissented from the decision, arguing that it improperly extended the Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity.[123]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Gorsuch agreed with the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to deny an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[124] In June 2021, he joined the justices in the unanimous Fulton v. City of Philadelphia decision, ruling in favor of a Catholic adoption agency that had been denied a contract by the City of Philadelphia due to the agency's refusal to adopt to same-sex couples.[125] Gorsuch and Thomas joined Alito's concurrence, which argued for reconsidering, possibly overturning, *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[126] Also in 2021, Gorsuch was one of three justices, with Thomas and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington State florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[127][128][129] In November 2021, Gorsuch dissented from the Court's 6–3 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[130] The decision to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor; Thomas and Alito also dissented.[131][132]\n\n\n\n### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2019\nGorsuch joined Thomas's dissent from denial of certiorari in *Peruta v. San Diego County*, in which the Ninth Circuit had upheld California's restrictive concealed carry laws.[133]\n\n\nGorsuch wrote a statement regarding the denial of an application for a stay presented to Roberts in *Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives*, a 2019 D.C. Circuit case challenging the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks. In his statement Gorsuch criticized the Trump Administration's action as well as the justification the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit used for upholding the ban.[134][135]\n\n\n\n### Vagueness doctrine[edit]\n\n\nIn *Sessions v. Dimaya* (2018), the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 to uphold the Ninth Circuit's decision that the residual clause in the Immigration and Nationality Act was unconstitutionally vague. Gorsuch joined Justices Kagan, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor in the opinion, and wrote a separate concurrence reiterating the importance of the vagueness doctrine within Scalia's 2015 opinion in *Johnson*.[136] In *United States v. Davis* (2019), Gorsuch wrote the Opinion of the Court striking down the residual clause of the Hobbs Act based on the rationale used in *Dimaya*.[137][138]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Gorsuch dissented when the Court voted against hearing cases brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.[139] He and Alito joined Thomas's dissent arguing that it was the Court's job to hear the case.[140]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Gorsuch sided with three of the Court's other conservative justices, rejecting a stay to temporarily block a law restricting abortion in Louisiana.[141] The law that the court temporarily stayed, in a 5–4 decision, would require that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a hospital.[142] In June 2020, the Supreme Court struck down Louisiana's abortion restriction in *June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo*, a 5–4 decision; Gorsuch was among the four dissenters.[143][144] In September 2021, the Supreme Court declined a petition to block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks; the vote was 5–4 with Gorsuch in the majority, joined by Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett.[145]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Gorsuch was among the five justices who formed the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, which ruled there is no constitutional right to abortion, overruling *Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[146]\n\n\n\n### Native American law[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch is regarded as an authority on American Indian law.[147] During his time on the Supreme Court, he has frequently affirmed tribal rights; his appointment to the Court was supported by multiple tribes and Native American organizations due to his favorable rulings as a Tenth Circuit judge.[148][149]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Gorsuch joined the four liberal justices (in two plurality opinions) in a 5–4 majority in *Washington State Dept. of Licensing v. Cougar Den, Inc.*[150] The Court's decision sided with the Yakama Nation, striking down a Washington state tax on transporting gasoline, on the basis of an 1855 treaty in which the Yakama ceded a large portion of Washington in exchange for certain rights.[151] In his concurrence, which was joined by Ginsburg, Gorsuch ended his opinion by writing: \"Really, this case just tells an old and familiar story. The State of Washington includes millions of acres that the Yakamas ceded to the United States under significant pressure. In return, the government supplied a handful of modest promises. The state is now dissatisfied with the consequences of one of those promises. It is a new day, and now it wants more. But today and to its credit, the Court holds the parties to the terms of their deal. It is the least we can do.\"[152]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Gorsuch again joined the four more liberal justices in a decision favorable to Native Americans' treaty rights, signing on to Justice Sotomayor's opinion to reach a 5–4 decision in *Herrera v. Wyoming*. The case held that hunting rights in Montana and Wyoming, granted by the U.S. government to the Native American Crow people by an 1868 treaty, were not extinguished by the 1890 grant of statehood to Wyoming.[153]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Gorsuch again joined the liberal justices to make a 5–4 majority in *McGirt v. Oklahoma*. The case considered whether much of eastern Oklahoma still remained under the jurisdiction of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\", given that the Native American Treaties that had designated the region as under their reservation status had never been dissolved by Congress, and, if so, whether crimes committed by Native Americans against other Native Americans on tribal land were under the jurisdiction of Native Courts.[154] The landmark decision in the affirmative, written by Gorsuch, found that \"For Major Crimes Act purposes, land reserved for the Creek Nation since the 19th century remains 'Indian country.'\"[155][156] In the opinion, he wrote: \"Today we are asked whether the land these treaties promised remains an Indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law. Because Congress has not said otherwise, we hold the government to its word.\"[156] The case was later reviewed in the June 2022 case Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, which considered whether non-Natives who committed crimes against Natives on Native American territory can be charged under the sole jurisdiction of Native American tribal courts.[157][158] While the state of Oklahoma had initially argued for the overturning of *McGirt*, the Court agreed to hear only issues relating to the impacts of *McGirt*.[159] The 5-4 decision by Justice Brett Kavanaugh opposed the more expanded viewpoint of non-Native criminal jurisdiction, with the opinion giving jurisdiction over such crimes to both tribal and federal/state governments. Gorsuch derided the opinion in his dissent, writing, \"Where this Court once stood firm, today it wilts.\"[160][161]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2022, Gorsuch, Barrett, and the three liberal justices ruled in favor of the Native American Tribes of Texas in the case *Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas*. The case concerned a dispute over whether Texas could control and regulate gambling on Texan Native American reservations. The initial conflict had developed from the tribes' having been in a trust with Texas from 1968 to 1987 before being granted a federal trust, resulting in a statute governing the tribes' subjugation to Texas's gambling restrictions.[162] The ruling emphasized that the tribes have the power to regulate electronic bingo games on their land regardless of the state's prohibition of non-prohibited gambling. Thus, as long as a game is not outright prohibited by the state of Texas, the state government cannot impose regulations upon tribal games. Gorsuch emphasized in his opinion that \"None of this is to say that the Tribe may offer gaming on whatever terms it wishes [...] Other gaming activities are subject to tribal regulation and must conform to the terms and conditions set forth in federal law.\"[163]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 restrictions[edit]\n\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Gorsuch joined the majority opinion in *Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo*, which struck down COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the state of New York on houses of worship.[164]\n\n\nOn May 18, 2023, Gorsuch issued a statement about the Court's decision to dismiss a lawsuit by several states aimed at continuing Title 42 expulsions of immigrants, a policy instituted to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 cases to the United States. His statement criticized many of the restrictions the government had imposed since the pandemic started and said, \"Since March 2020, we may have experienced the greatest intrusions on civil liberties in the peacetime history of this country.\"[165]\n\n\n\n## Legal philosophy[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch is a proponent of originalism, the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted as perceived at the time of enactment, and of textualism, the idea that statutes should be interpreted literally, without considering the legislative history and underlying purpose of the law.[2][3][4] An editorial in the *National Catholic Register* opined that Gorsuch's judicial decisions lean more toward natural law philosophy.[166]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Bonnie Kristian of *The Week* wrote that an \"unexpected civil libertarian alliance\" was developing between Gorsuch and Sotomayor \"in defense of robust due process rights and skepticism of law enforcement overreach.\"[167]\n\n\n\n### Voting alignment[edit]\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight used Lee Epstein et al.'s Judicial Common Space scores[168] (which are not based on a judge's behavior, but rather the ideology scores of either home state senators or the appointing president) to find a close alignment between the conservatism of other appellate and Supreme Court judges such as Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito.[169] *The Washington Post*'s statistical analysis estimated that the ideologies of most of Trump's announced candidates were \"statistically indistinguishable\" and also associated Gorsuch with Kavanaugh and Alito.[170]\n\n\n\n### Judicial activism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch in 2019\nIn a 2016 speech at Case Western Reserve University, Gorsuch said that judges should strive to apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be—not to decide cases based on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they believe might serve society best.[171]\n\n\nIn a 2005 *National Review* article, Gorsuch argued that \"American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda\" and that they are \"failing to reach out and persuade the public\". He wrote that, in doing so, American liberals are circumventing the democratic process on issues like gay marriage, school vouchers, and assisted suicide, and this has led to a compromised judiciary, which is no longer independent. Gorsuch wrote that American liberals' \"overweening addiction\" to using the courts for social debate is \"bad for the nation and bad for the judiciary\".[47][172]\n\n\n\n### Federalism and state power[edit]\n\n\nJustin Marceau, a professor at the University of Denver's Sturm College of Law, called Gorsuch \"a predictably socially conservative judge who tends to favor state power over federal power\". Marceau added that this is important because federal laws have been used to try to reel in \"rogue\" state laws in civil rights cases.[173]\n\n\n\n### Assisted suicide[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2006, Gorsuch's book *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia*, developed from his doctoral thesis, was published by Princeton University Press.[38][174][175][176] In the book, Gorsuch makes clear his personal opposition to euthanasia and assisted suicide, arguing that the U.S. should \"retain existing law [banning assisted suicide and euthanasia] on the basis that human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable, and that the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong.\"[59][175][177]\n\n\n\n### Statutory interpretation[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has been considered to follow in Scalia's footsteps as a textualist in statutory interpretation of the plain meaning of the law.[178][179] This was exemplified in his majority opinion in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, 590 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2020), which ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 grants protection from employment discrimination due to sexual orientation and gender identity. Gorsuch wrote in the decision, \"An employer who fired an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\"[180][181][182]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch and family with Donald Trump, Anthony Kennedy, and Mike Pence prior to his swearing-in\nGorsuch and his wife, Marie Louise Gorsuch,[183] a British citizen, met at Oxford. The two married at St. Nicholas' Anglican Church in Henley-on-Thames in 1996.[184][185] They live in Boulder, Colorado, and have two daughters.[186][187][188]\n\n\nGorsuch enjoys the outdoors and fly fishing; he went fly fishing on at least one occasion with Justice Scalia.[10][189] He raises horses, chickens, and goats, and often arranges ski trips with colleagues and friends.[56]\n\n\nHe has authored two nonfiction books. The first, *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia*, was published by Princeton University Press in July 2006.[190] He is a co-author of *The Law of Judicial Precedent*, published by Thomson West in 2016.[35]\n\n\nIn 2017, after his announcement as a Supreme Court nominee, *the New York Times* reported that Gorsuch owned a timeshare outside Granby, Colorado, with associates of Philip Anschutz, that was later sold the same year.[36] Reporting from *Politico* in April 2023 revealed that Gorsuch had sold the cabin to Brian Duffy, the CEO of the law firm Greenberg Traurig, which litigates cases before the Supreme Court, but failed to disclose the purchaser's identity on his federal disclosure forms.[191] The property was listed for sale for a few years but did not go under contract until the week after Gorsuch joined the Supreme Court.[191][192] Since 2017, Greenberg Traurig has been involved in at least 22 cases before or presented to the Supreme Court.[191][193]\n\n\nGorsuch has been active in several professional associations throughout his legal career,[23] including the American Bar Association, the American Trial Lawyers Association, Phi Beta Kappa, the Republican National Lawyers Association, and the New York, Colorado, and District of Columbia Bar Associations.[23] In May 2019, it was announced that Gorsuch would become the new chairman of the board of the National Constitution Center, succeeding former vice president Joe Biden.[194]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch was the first member of a mainline Protestant denomination to sit on the Supreme Court since the retirement of John Paul Stevens in 2010.[195][196][197] He and his two siblings were raised Catholic and attended weekly Mass.[198][186] His wife, Louise, is British-born; the two met while Neil was studying at Oxford. Louise was raised in the Church of England.[199]\n\n\nWhen the couple returned to the United States they joined Holy Comforter, an Episcopal parish in Vienna, Virginia, attending weekly services. Gorsuch volunteered there as an usher.[197] The Gorsuch family later attended St. John's Episcopal Church in Boulder, Colorado, a liberal church with a longstanding open-door policy for the LGBT community.[91][200][201] During his 2017 confirmation hearing, responding to a senator's question about his faith, Gorsuch replied, \"I attend an Episcopal church in Boulder with my family, senator.\"[202][203][204] After marrying in a non-Catholic ceremony and joining an Episcopal church, Gorsuch has not publicly clarified his religious affiliation.[199]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch received the Edward J. Randolph Award for outstanding service to the Department of Justice and the Harry S. Truman Foundation's Stevens Award for outstanding public service in the field of law.[188]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* Gorsuch, Neil (2004). *The right to receive assistance in suicide and euthanasia, with particular reference to the law of the United States* (DPhil thesis).

Jackson was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Joe Biden on February 25, 2022, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate and sworn into office that same year.[1][2] She is the first black woman and the first former federal public defender to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\n\nJackson was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Miami, Florida. She received her undergraduate and legal education at Harvard University, where she served as an editor of the *Harvard Law Review*, and clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer, whose seat she later assumed on the Supreme Court.[3] From 2010 to 2014, Jackson was the vice chairwoman of the United States Sentencing Commission. In 2013, President Barack Obama appointed her as a district judge for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, where she served until 2021. Since 2016, Jackson has been a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nJackson was born on September 14, 1970, in Washington, D.C.,[4] to parents who had been educated at historically black colleges and universities.[5][6][7] Her father, Johnny Brown, attended the University of Miami School of Law and became chief attorney for the Miami-Dade County School Board. Her mother, Ellery, was school principal at the New World School of the Arts in Miami.[8][9] One of her uncles, Calvin Ross, served as the chief of the Miami Police Department.[8]\n\n\nJackson grew up in Miami and attended Miami Palmetto Senior High School.[10] She distinguished herself as a champion debater,[11] winning the national oratory title at the National Catholic Forensic League championships in New Orleans during her senior year.[12] She has recalled her experience with high school debate as one \"that I can say without hesitation was the one activity that best prepared me for future success in law and in life.\"[13] In 1988, Jackson graduated from Palmetto as senior class president.[11][14] In her high school yearbook, she was quoted as saying that she wanted \"to go into law and eventually have a judicial appointment\".[15]\n\n\nAfter high school, Jackson matriculated at Harvard University to study government, having applied despite her guidance counselor's advice to set her sights lower.[16] She took classes in drama and performed improv comedy, forming a diverse friend group.[17][18] As a member of the Black Students Association, she led protests against a student who displayed a Confederate flag from his dormitory window and protested the lack of full-time professors in the Afro-American Studies Department. While a freshman, Jackson enrolled in Michael Sandel's course *Justice*, which she has called a major influence during her undergraduate years.[18]\n\n\nIn 1989, when Jackson was a college student, an uncle, Thomas Brown Jr., was sentenced to life in prison for a nonviolent cocaine conviction after federal agents found 14 kilograms of cocaine wrapped in duct tape. Years later, Jackson persuaded a law firm to take his case *pro bono*, and President Barack Obama eventually commuted his sentence.[19][20]\n\n\nJackson graduated from Harvard in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts, *magna cum laude*.[21][11] Her senior thesis was titled \"The Hand of Oppression: Plea Bargaining Processes and the Coercion of Criminal Defendants\".[22] From 1992 to 1993, Jackson worked as a staff reporter and researcher for *Time* magazine,[23] attending Harvard Law School shortly afterward. She was a supervising editor of the *Harvard Law Review* and graduated in 1996 with a Juris Doctor, *cum laude*.[24][25]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Jackson served as a law clerk to Judge Patti B. Saris of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts from 1996 to 1997,[23] then to Judge Bruce M. Selya of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit from 1997 to 1998.[26] She spent a year in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm of Miller Cassidy Larroca & Lewin (now part of Baker Botts), then clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer from 1999 to 2000.[10][27]\n\n\nJackson returned to private legal practice at the law firm of Goodwin Procter from 2000 to 2002, then under Kenneth Feinberg at the law firm now called Feinberg & Rozen LLP from 2002 to 2003.[28][29] From 2003 to 2005, she was an assistant special counsel to the United States Sentencing Commission.[30] From 2005 to 2007, Jackson was an assistant federal public defender in Washington, D.C., where she handled cases before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[31] A review by *The* *Washington Post* of cases Jackson handled during her time as a public defender showed that \"she won uncommon victories against the government that shortened or erased lengthy prison terms\".[32] From 2007 to 2010, Jackson was an appellate specialist in private practice at the law firm of Morrison & Foerster.[29][27]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Sentencing Commission (2010–2014)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 23, 2009, President Obama nominated Jackson as vice chair of the United States Sentencing Commission.[33][34] The Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination by voice vote on November 5, 2009. The Senate confirmed her nomination by voice vote on February 11, 2010.[35] She succeeded Michael E. Horowitz, who had served from 2003 until 2009. Jackson served on the Sentencing Commission until 2014.[36][27] During her time on the commission, it retroactively amended the sentencing guidelines to reduce the guideline range for crack cocaine offenses,[37] and enacted the \"drugs minus two\" amendment, which implemented a two offense-level reduction for drug crimes.[38]\n\n\n\n## District Court (2013–2021)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jackson on the bench of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (pictured in 2019)\nOn September 20, 2012, Obama nominated Jackson to serve as a United States district judge for the District of Columbia to the seat vacated by retiring judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr.[39] Republican U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, a relative by marriage, introduced Jackson at her December 2012 confirmation hearing and said, \"Our politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji's intellect, for her character, for her integrity, it is unequivocal.\"[8] On February 14, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination by voice vote.[40] She was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on March 22, received her commission on March 26,[27] and was sworn in by Justice Breyer in May.[41] Her service as a district judge ended on June 17, 2021, when she was elevated to the court of appeals.[27]\n\n\nDuring her time on the district court, Jackson wrote multiple decisions adverse to the positions of the Trump administration. In her opinion ordering Trump's former White House counsel Don McGahn to comply with a legislative subpoena, she wrote that \"presidents are not kings\".[42] Jackson handled a number of challenges to executive agency actions that raised questions of administrative law. She also issued rulings in several cases that gained particular political attention.[43]\n\n\n*Bloomberg Law* reported in spring 2021 that conservative activists were pointing to certain decisions by Jackson that had been reversed on appeal as a \"potential blemish on her record\".[44] In 2019, Jackson ruled that provisions in three Trump executive orders conflicted with federal employee rights to collective bargaining. Her decision was reversed unanimously by the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit also reversed another 2019 decision, involving a challenge to a Department of Homeland Security decision to expand the agency's definition of which non-citizens can be deported. Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron defended Jackson's record, saying she \"has written nearly 600 opinions and been reversed less than twelve times\".[44]\n\n\n\n### Selected rulings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jackson in 2020\nIn *American Meat Institute v. U.S. Department of Agriculture* (2013), Jackson rejected the meat packing industry's request for a preliminary injunction to block a United States Department of Agriculture rule requiring them to identify animals' country of origin. Jackson found that the rule likely did not violate the First Amendment.[45][46]\n\n\nIn *Depomed v. Department of Health and Human Services* (2014), Jackson ruled that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had violated the Administrative Procedure Act when it failed to grant pharmaceutical company Depomed market exclusivity for its orphan drug Gralise. She concluded that the Orphan Drug Act required the FDA to grant Gralise exclusivity.[47]\n\n\nIn *Pierce v. District of Columbia* (2015), Jackson ruled that the D.C. Department of Corrections violated the rights of a deaf inmate under the Americans with Disabilities Act because jail officials failed to provide the inmate with reasonable accommodations, or to assess his need for reasonable accommodations, during his detention in 2012. She held that \"the District's willful blindness regarding\" Pierce's need for accommodation and its half-hearted attempt to provide Pierce with a random assortment of auxiliary aids—and only after he specifically requested them—fell far short of what the law requires.\"[48]\n\n\nIn April and June 2018, Jackson presided over two cases challenging the Department of Health and Human Services' decision to terminate grants for teen pregnancy prevention programs two years early.[49] She ruled that the decision to terminate the grants early without explanation was arbitrary and capricious.[50]\n\n\nIn *American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump* (2018), Jackson invalidated provisions of three executive orders that would have limited the time federal employee labor union officials could spend with union members, the issues that unions could bargain over in negotiations, and the rights of disciplined workers to appeal disciplinary actions. She ruled that the executive orders violated the right of federal employees to collectively bargain, as guaranteed by the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.[51] The D.C. Circuit vacated this ruling on jurisdictional grounds in 2019.[52][53]\n\n\nIn 2018, Jackson dismissed 40 wrongful death and product liability lawsuits stemming from the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which had been combined into a single multidistrict litigation. She held that under the doctrine of *forum non conveniens*, the suits should be brought in Malaysia, not the U.S. The D.C. Circuit affirmed this ruling in 2020.[54][55][56][57]\n\n\nIn 2019, in *Center for Biological Diversity v. McAleenan*, Jackson held that Congress had, through the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, stripped federal courts of jurisdiction to hear non-constitutional challenges to the United States Secretary of Homeland Security's decision to waive certain environmental requirements to facilitate construction of a border wall on the United States and Mexico border.[58]\n\n\nIn 2019, Jackson issued a preliminary injunction in *Make The Road New York v. McAleenan*, blocking a Trump administration rule that would have expanded expedited removal (\"fast-track\" deportations) without immigration court hearings for undocumented immigrants.[59] She found that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because its decision was arbitrary and capricious and the agency did not seek public comment before issuing the rule.[60] In a 2–1 ruling in 2020, the D.C. Circuit reversed the entry of the preliminary injunction, ruling that the IIRIRA (by committing the matter to the executive branch's \"sole and unreviewable discretion\") precluded APA review of the decision.[61]\n\n\nIn 2019, Jackson issued a ruling in *Committee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of Representatives v. McGahn*, in which the House Committee on the Judiciary sued former White House Counsel Don McGahn to compel him to comply with the subpoena to appear at an impeachment inquiry hearing on issues of alleged obstruction of justice by the Trump administration. McGahn declined to comply with the subpoena after President Donald Trump, relying on a legal theory of executive testimonial immunity, ordered McGahn not to testify. In a lengthy opinion, Jackson ruled in favor of the House Committee and held that senior-level presidential aides \"who have been subpoenaed for testimony by an authorized committee of Congress must appear for testimony in response to that subpoena\" even if the president orders them not to do so.[62] Jackson rejected the administration's assertion of executive testimonial immunity by holding that \"with respect to senior-level presidential aides, absolute immunity from compelled congressional process simply does not exist\".[63] According to her, that conclusion was \"inescapable precisely because compulsory appearance by dint of a subpoena is a legal construct, not a political one, and per the Constitution, no one is above the law.\"[63][64][65] Jackson's use of the phrase \"presidents are not kings\" gained popular attention in subsequent media reporting on the ruling.[66][67][68][69] Noting that she took four months to resolve the case, including writing a 120-page opinion, *The Washington Post* wrote: \"That slow pace contributed to helping Mr. Trump run out the clock on the congressional oversight effort before the 2020 election.\"[8] The ruling was appealed by the United States Department of Justice,[70] and the D.C. Circuit affirmed part of Jackson's decision in August 2020.[71] While the case remained pending, on June 4, 2021, McGahn testified behind closed doors under an agreement reached with the Biden administration.[72]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals (2021–2022)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Jackson with Justice Stephen BreyerOn March 30, 2021, President Biden announced his intention to nominate Jackson as a United States circuit judge for the District of Columbia Circuit.[73] On April 19, 2021, her nomination was sent to the Senate. Biden nominated Jackson to the seat vacated by Judge Merrick Garland, who had stepped down to become U.S. Attorney General.[74] The American Bar Association appraised Jackson as \"well qualified with no recusals or abstentions\".[75]\n\n\nOn April 28, 2021, a hearing on her nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[76] During her confirmation hearing, Jackson was questioned about several of her rulings against the Trump administration.[77] On May 20, Jackson's nomination was reported out of committee by a 13–9 vote.[78] On June 8, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer filed cloture on her nomination. On June 10, the Senate invoked cloture on her nomination by a 52–46 vote.[79] On June 14, her nomination was confirmed by a 53–44 vote. Republican senators Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham, and Lisa Murkowski joined all 50 Democrats in voting to confirm Jackson.[80] She received her judicial commission on June 17, 2021.[81] Her service as a circuit judge ended on June 29, 2022, the day before she was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.[27]\n\n\nIn her first written opinion for the court of appeals, Jackson, joined by the rest of the panel, invalidated a 2020 rule by the Federal Labor Relations Authority that had restricted the bargaining power of federal-sector labor unions.[82]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ketanji Brown Jackson Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Jackson delivers remarks on her nomination in the Grand Foyer of the White House. (February 25, 2022)\n![](image)Justice Breyer administering the Judicial Oath to Jackson (June 30, 2022)\nIn early 2016, Obama administration officials vetted Jackson as a potential nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.[83][84][85] Jackson was one of five candidates interviewed as a potential nominee.[86]\n\n\nIn early 2022, news outlets speculated that Biden would nominate Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill the seat vacated by Justice Breyer.[87][88][89][90] Biden pledged during the 2020 United States presidential election campaign to appoint a Black woman to the court should a vacancy occur.[87] Jackson's appointment to the D.C. Circuit, considered the second-most influential federal court, was viewed as preparation for a potential promotion to the Supreme Court.[91]\n\n\nJackson's potential nomination to the Supreme Court was supported by civil rights and liberal advocacy organizations.[19] Her potential nomination was opposed by Republican Party leaders and senators.[92][93][94] *The Washington Post* wrote that Jackson's experience as a public defender \"has endeared her to the more liberal base of the Democratic Party\".[95] While her supporters have touted her history as a public defender as an asset, during her 2021 confirmation hearing, Republicans tried to cast it as a liability.[32]\n\n\nOn February 25, 2022, Biden announced that Jackson was his nominee to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court.[96] Her nomination was sent to the Senate on February 28.[97] Her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee was held on March 21.[98] After the Judiciary Committee deadlocked on her nomination by an 11–11 vote, the Senate discharged the committee from further consideration of her nomination by a 53–47 vote.[99][100][101][102] The next day, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of her nomination by a 53–47 vote,[103] and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer then filed cloture on her nomination.[104] On April 7, the Senate invoked cloture on her nomination by a 53–47 vote.[105][106] Later that day, she was confirmed by the same margin.[107] Republicans Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins joined all Democrats in confirming Jackson to the Supreme Court.[108] She received her judicial commission as an associate justice on April 8.[27] She was sworn in and became an associate justice at noon on June 30, 2022, when Breyer's retirement went into effect.[109][110][111][112]\n\n\n\n## U. S. Supreme Court (2022–present)[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court released its final merit opinions on the morning of June 30, 2022. At noon, Breyer officially retired and Jackson was sworn in, becoming the first Black woman[13][11] and the first former federal public defender to serve on the Supreme Court.[113][114][115][116]\n\n\nOn July 21, Jackson voted on her first Supreme Court case, joining the dissent in a 5–4 decision refusing to block a district court ruling that prevented the Biden administration from setting new enforcement priorities for immigrants entering the U.S. or living in the country illegally.[117] She participated in her first oral argument as an associate justice on October 3, in *Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency*.[118] On November 7 she wrote her first opinion, a two-page dissent from a denial of review in the case of a death row inmate in *Chinn v. Shoop*; the opinion was joined by Justice Sotomayor.[119]\n\n\nTwo contributors to *SCOTUSBlog* noted that, since joining the Court at the beginning of the 2022 term, Jackson was the most active participant in oral arguments, speaking an average of 1,350 words per argument, while the eight other justices each spoke on average fewer than 1,000.[120] On February 28, 2023, Jackson authored her first majority opinion for a unanimous court in *Delaware v. Pennsylvania*, which involved how unclaimed money from MoneyGrams are distributed among individual states.[121]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2022, Jackson was assigned as the circuit justice for the First Circuit.[122]\n\n\n\n### Labor disputes[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, Jackson wrote the sole dissenting opinion in Glacier Northwest, Inc. v. Teamsters, concerning the power of employers to sue labor unions regarding the destruction of employer property following a strike. She wrote that the majority's decision failed \"Congress's intent with respect to the Board's primary role in adjudicating labor disputes\" and ran the risk of potential \"erosion of the right to strike\".[123]\n\n\n\n### Judicial philosophy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Jackson at the James B. Parsons Legacy Dinner on February 24, 2020\nJackson says she does not have a particular judicial philosophy;[124] instead, she says she has a perspective on legal analysis or a \"judicial methodology\".[125][126] Though she has not embraced the label, Jackson has expressed that she sees value in originalism, saying the \"Constitution is fixed in its meaning\", and has explicitly criticized living constitutionalism.[126]\n\n\nIn January 2022, *The New York Times* reported that Jackson had \"not yet written a body of appeals court opinions expressing a legal philosophy\" because she had joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in the summer of 2021. However, *The Times* said, Jackson's earlier rulings \"comported with those of a liberal-leaning judge\", including her opinions blocking various Trump administration actions.[8] Additionally, a review of over 500 of her judicial opinions indicated that she would likely be as liberal as Breyer, the justice she replaced.[127]\n\n\nAccording to Sahil Kapur, writing for NBC News, \"Jackson fits well with the Democratic Party and the progressive movement's agenda\" due to her relative youth, background as a public defender, and history of labor-friendly rulings.[128]\n\n\n*Politico* reported that \"Jackson is popular with liberal legal activists looking to replace Breyer with a justice willing to engage in ideological combat with the court's conservatives.\"[129]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Jackson married surgeon Patrick Graves Jackson, whom she met at Harvard College.[130] He is a descendant of Continental Congress delegate Jonathan Jackson[131] and is related to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.[132] The couple have two daughters.[133][134][135] Jackson is a non-denominational Protestant.[136] In a 2017 speech, she said, \"I am fairly certain that if you traced my family lineage back past my grandparents—who were raised in Georgia, by the way—you would find that my ancestors were slaves on both sides.\"[137] Jackson's paternal ancestry can be traced to Houston County, Georgia,[138] while her maternal ancestry can be traced to Calhoun County, Georgia.[139] Through her marriage, Jackson is related to former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.[140]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nJackson is a member of the Judicial Conference Committee on Defender Services as well as Harvard University's Board of Overseers and the Council of the American Law Institute.[141] She also serves on the board of Georgetown Day School[142] and the U.S. Supreme Court Fellows Commission.[143]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2011, she served on the advisory board of Montrose Christian School, a Baptist school.[144] Jackson has served as a judge in several mock trials with the Shakespeare Theatre Company[145][146][147] and for the Historical Society of the District of Columbia's Mock Court Program.[148] In 2018, she presided over a mock trial hosted by Drexel University's Thomas R. Kline School of Law \"to determine if Vice President Aaron Burr was guilty of murdering\" Alexander Hamilton.[149]\n\n\nIn 2017, Jackson presented at the University of Georgia School of Law's 35th Edith House Lecture.[150] In 2018, she was a panelist at the National Constitution Center's town hall on Alexander Hamilton's legacy.[151] In 2020, Jackson gave the Martin Luther King Jr. Day lecture at the University of Michigan Law School[152] and was honored at the University of Chicago Law School's third annual Judge James B. Parsons Legacy Dinner, hosted by the school's Black Law Students Association.[153] In 2022, she received the Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award, presented by Awards Council members Justice Amy Coney Barrett and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.[154][155]\n\n\nJackson became an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority in 2023.[156]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n* Recent Case (1995). \"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) – Scope of Liability after Reves v.

Jackson was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Joe Biden on February 25, 2022, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate and sworn into office that same year.[1][2] She is the first black woman and the first former federal public defender to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\n\nJackson was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Miami, Florida. She received her undergraduate and legal education at Harvard University, where she served as an editor of the *Harvard Law Review*, and clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer, whose seat she later assumed on the Supreme Court.[3] From 2010 to 2014, Jackson was the vice chairwoman of the United States Sentencing Commission. In 2013, President Barack Obama appointed her as a district judge for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, where she served until 2021. Since 2016, Jackson has been a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nJackson was born on September 14, 1970, in Washington, D.C.,[4] to parents who had been educated at historically black colleges and universities.[5][6][7] Her father, Johnny Brown, attended the University of Miami School of Law and became chief attorney for the Miami-Dade County School Board. Her mother, Ellery, was school principal at the New World School of the Arts in Miami.[8][9] One of her uncles, Calvin Ross, served as the chief of the Miami Police Department.[8]\n\n\nJackson grew up in Miami and attended Miami Palmetto Senior High School.[10] She distinguished herself as a champion debater,[11] winning the national oratory title at the National Catholic Forensic League championships in New Orleans during her senior year.[12] She has recalled her experience with high school debate as one \"that I can say without hesitation was the one activity that best prepared me for future success in law and in life.\"[13] In 1988, Jackson graduated from Palmetto as senior class president.[11][14] In her high school yearbook, she was quoted as saying that she wanted \"to go into law and eventually have a judicial appointment\".[15]\n\n\nAfter high school, Jackson matriculated at Harvard University to study government, having applied despite her guidance counselor's advice to set her sights lower.[16] She took classes in drama and performed improv comedy, forming a diverse friend group.[17][18] As a member of the Black Students Association, she led protests against a student who displayed a Confederate flag from his dormitory window and protested the lack of full-time professors in the Afro-American Studies Department. While a freshman, Jackson enrolled in Michael Sandel's course *Justice*, which she has called a major influence during her undergraduate years.[18]\n\n\nIn 1989, when Jackson was a college student, an uncle, Thomas Brown Jr., was sentenced to life in prison for a nonviolent cocaine conviction after federal agents found 14 kilograms of cocaine wrapped in duct tape. Years later, Jackson persuaded a law firm to take his case *pro bono*, and President Barack Obama eventually commuted his sentence.[19][20]\n\n\nJackson graduated from Harvard in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts, *magna cum laude*.[21][11] Her senior thesis was titled \"The Hand of Oppression: Plea Bargaining Processes and the Coercion of Criminal Defendants\".[22] From 1992 to 1993, Jackson worked as a staff reporter and researcher for *Time* magazine,[23] attending Harvard Law School shortly afterward. She was a supervising editor of the *Harvard Law Review* and graduated in 1996 with a Juris Doctor, *cum laude*.[24][25]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Jackson served as a law clerk to Judge Patti B. Saris of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts from 1996 to 1997,[23] then to Judge Bruce M. Selya of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit from 1997 to 1998.[26] She spent a year in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm of Miller Cassidy Larroca & Lewin (now part of Baker Botts), then clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer from 1999 to 2000.[10][27]\n\n\nJackson returned to private legal practice at the law firm of Goodwin Procter from 2000 to 2002, then under Kenneth Feinberg at the law firm now called Feinberg & Rozen LLP from 2002 to 2003.[28][29] From 2003 to 2005, she was an assistant special counsel to the United States Sentencing Commission.[30] From 2005 to 2007, Jackson was an assistant federal public defender in Washington, D.C., where she handled cases before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[31] A review by *The* *Washington Post* of cases Jackson handled during her time as a public defender showed that \"she won uncommon victories against the government that shortened or erased lengthy prison terms\".[32] From 2007 to 2010, Jackson was an appellate specialist in private practice at the law firm of Morrison & Foerster.[29][27]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Sentencing Commission (2010–2014)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 23, 2009, President Obama nominated Jackson as vice chair of the United States Sentencing Commission.[33][34] The Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination by voice vote on November 5, 2009. The Senate confirmed her nomination by voice vote on February 11, 2010.[35] She succeeded Michael E. Horowitz, who had served from 2003 until 2009. Jackson served on the Sentencing Commission until 2014.[36][27] During her time on the commission, it retroactively amended the sentencing guidelines to reduce the guideline range for crack cocaine offenses,[37] and enacted the \"drugs minus two\" amendment, which implemented a two offense-level reduction for drug crimes.[38]\n\n\n\n## District Court (2013–2021)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jackson on the bench of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (pictured in 2019)\nOn September 20, 2012, Obama nominated Jackson to serve as a United States district judge for the District of Columbia to the seat vacated by retiring judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr.[39] Republican U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, a relative by marriage, introduced Jackson at her December 2012 confirmation hearing and said, \"Our politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji's intellect, for her character, for her integrity, it is unequivocal.\"[8] On February 14, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination by voice vote.[40] She was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on March 22, received her commission on March 26,[27] and was sworn in by Justice Breyer in May.[41] Her service as a district judge ended on June 17, 2021, when she was elevated to the court of appeals.[27]\n\n\nDuring her time on the district court, Jackson wrote multiple decisions adverse to the positions of the Trump administration. In her opinion ordering Trump's former White House counsel Don McGahn to comply with a legislative subpoena, she wrote that \"presidents are not kings\".[42] Jackson handled a number of challenges to executive agency actions that raised questions of administrative law. She also issued rulings in several cases that gained particular political attention.[43]\n\n\n*Bloomberg Law* reported in spring 2021 that conservative activists were pointing to certain decisions by Jackson that had been reversed on appeal as a \"potential blemish on her record\".[44] In 2019, Jackson ruled that provisions in three Trump executive orders conflicted with federal employee rights to collective bargaining. Her decision was reversed unanimously by the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit also reversed another 2019 decision, involving a challenge to a Department of Homeland Security decision to expand the agency's definition of which non-citizens can be deported. Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron defended Jackson's record, saying she \"has written nearly 600 opinions and been reversed less than twelve times\".[44]\n\n\n\n### Selected rulings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jackson in 2020\nIn *American Meat Institute v. U.S. Department of Agriculture* (2013), Jackson rejected the meat packing industry's request for a preliminary injunction to block a United States Department of Agriculture rule requiring them to identify animals' country of origin. Jackson found that the rule likely did not violate the First Amendment.[45][46]\n\n\nIn *Depomed v. Department of Health and Human Services* (2014), Jackson ruled that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had violated the Administrative Procedure Act when it failed to grant pharmaceutical company Depomed market exclusivity for its orphan drug Gralise. She concluded that the Orphan Drug Act required the FDA to grant Gralise exclusivity.[47]\n\n\nIn *Pierce v. District of Columbia* (2015), Jackson ruled that the D.C. Department of Corrections violated the rights of a deaf inmate under the Americans with Disabilities Act because jail officials failed to provide the inmate with reasonable accommodations, or to assess his need for reasonable accommodations, during his detention in 2012. She held that \"the District's willful blindness regarding\" Pierce's need for accommodation and its half-hearted attempt to provide Pierce with a random assortment of auxiliary aids—and only after he specifically requested them—fell far short of what the law requires.\"[48]\n\n\nIn April and June 2018, Jackson presided over two cases challenging the Department of Health and Human Services' decision to terminate grants for teen pregnancy prevention programs two years early.[49] She ruled that the decision to terminate the grants early without explanation was arbitrary and capricious.[50]\n\n\nIn *American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump* (2018), Jackson invalidated provisions of three executive orders that would have limited the time federal employee labor union officials could spend with union members, the issues that unions could bargain over in negotiations, and the rights of disciplined workers to appeal disciplinary actions. She ruled that the executive orders violated the right of federal employees to collectively bargain, as guaranteed by the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.[51] The D.C. Circuit vacated this ruling on jurisdictional grounds in 2019.[52][53]\n\n\nIn 2018, Jackson dismissed 40 wrongful death and product liability lawsuits stemming from the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which had been combined into a single multidistrict litigation. She held that under the doctrine of *forum non conveniens*, the suits should be brought in Malaysia, not the U.S. The D.C. Circuit affirmed this ruling in 2020.[54][55][56][57]\n\n\nIn 2019, in *Center for Biological Diversity v. McAleenan*, Jackson held that Congress had, through the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, stripped federal courts of jurisdiction to hear non-constitutional challenges to the United States Secretary of Homeland Security's decision to waive certain environmental requirements to facilitate construction of a border wall on the United States and Mexico border.[58]\n\n\nIn 2019, Jackson issued a preliminary injunction in *Make The Road New York v. McAleenan*, blocking a Trump administration rule that would have expanded expedited removal (\"fast-track\" deportations) without immigration court hearings for undocumented immigrants.[59] She found that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because its decision was arbitrary and capricious and the agency did not seek public comment before issuing the rule.[60] In a 2–1 ruling in 2020, the D.C. Circuit reversed the entry of the preliminary injunction, ruling that the IIRIRA (by committing the matter to the executive branch's \"sole and unreviewable discretion\") precluded APA review of the decision.[61]\n\n\nIn 2019, Jackson issued a ruling in *Committee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of Representatives v. McGahn*, in which the House Committee on the Judiciary sued former White House Counsel Don McGahn to compel him to comply with the subpoena to appear at an impeachment inquiry hearing on issues of alleged obstruction of justice by the Trump administration. McGahn declined to comply with the subpoena after President Donald Trump, relying on a legal theory of executive testimonial immunity, ordered McGahn not to testify. In a lengthy opinion, Jackson ruled in favor of the House Committee and held that senior-level presidential aides \"who have been subpoenaed for testimony by an authorized committee of Congress must appear for testimony in response to that subpoena\" even if the president orders them not to do so.[62] Jackson rejected the administration's assertion of executive testimonial immunity by holding that \"with respect to senior-level presidential aides, absolute immunity from compelled congressional process simply does not exist\".[63] According to her, that conclusion was \"inescapable precisely because compulsory appearance by dint of a subpoena is a legal construct, not a political one, and per the Constitution, no one is above the law.\"[63][64][65] Jackson's use of the phrase \"presidents are not kings\" gained popular attention in subsequent media reporting on the ruling.[66][67][68][69] Noting that she took four months to resolve the case, including writing a 120-page opinion, *The Washington Post* wrote: \"That slow pace contributed to helping Mr. Trump run out the clock on the congressional oversight effort before the 2020 election.\"[8] The ruling was appealed by the United States Department of Justice,[70] and the D.C. Circuit affirmed part of Jackson's decision in August 2020.[71] While the case remained pending, on June 4, 2021, McGahn testified behind closed doors under an agreement reached with the Biden administration.[72]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals (2021–2022)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Jackson with Justice Stephen BreyerOn March 30, 2021, President Biden announced his intention to nominate Jackson as a United States circuit judge for the District of Columbia Circuit.[73] On April 19, 2021, her nomination was sent to the Senate. Biden nominated Jackson to the seat vacated by Judge Merrick Garland, who had stepped down to become U.S. Attorney General.[74] The American Bar Association appraised Jackson as \"well qualified with no recusals or abstentions\".[75]\n\n\nOn April 28, 2021, a hearing on her nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[76] During her confirmation hearing, Jackson was questioned about several of her rulings against the Trump administration.[77] On May 20, Jackson's nomination was reported out of committee by a 13–9 vote.[78] On June 8, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer filed cloture on her nomination. On June 10, the Senate invoked cloture on her nomination by a 52–46 vote.[79] On June 14, her nomination was confirmed by a 53–44 vote. Republican senators Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham, and Lisa Murkowski joined all 50 Democrats in voting to confirm Jackson.[80] She received her judicial commission on June 17, 2021.[81] Her service as a circuit judge ended on June 29, 2022, the day before she was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.[27]\n\n\nIn her first written opinion for the court of appeals, Jackson, joined by the rest of the panel, invalidated a 2020 rule by the Federal Labor Relations Authority that had restricted the bargaining power of federal-sector labor unions.[82]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ketanji Brown Jackson Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Jackson delivers remarks on her nomination in the Grand Foyer of the White House. (February 25, 2022)\n![](image)Justice Breyer administering the Judicial Oath to Jackson (June 30, 2022)\nIn early 2016, Obama administration officials vetted Jackson as a potential nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.[83][84][85] Jackson was one of five candidates interviewed as a potential nominee.[86]\n\n\nIn early 2022, news outlets speculated that Biden would nominate Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill the seat vacated by Justice Breyer.[87][88][89][90] Biden pledged during the 2020 United States presidential election campaign to appoint a Black woman to the court should a vacancy occur.[87] Jackson's appointment to the D.C. Circuit, considered the second-most influential federal court, was viewed as preparation for a potential promotion to the Supreme Court.[91]\n\n\nJackson's potential nomination to the Supreme Court was supported by civil rights and liberal advocacy organizations.[19] Her potential nomination was opposed by Republican Party leaders and senators.[92][93][94] *The Washington Post* wrote that Jackson's experience as a public defender \"has endeared her to the more liberal base of the Democratic Party\".[95] While her supporters have touted her history as a public defender as an asset, during her 2021 confirmation hearing, Republicans tried to cast it as a liability.[32]\n\n\nOn February 25, 2022, Biden announced that Jackson was his nominee to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court.[96] Her nomination was sent to the Senate on February 28.[97] Her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee was held on March 21.[98] After the Judiciary Committee deadlocked on her nomination by an 11–11 vote, the Senate discharged the committee from further consideration of her nomination by a 53–47 vote.[99][100][101][102] The next day, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of her nomination by a 53–47 vote,[103] and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer then filed cloture on her nomination.[104] On April 7, the Senate invoked cloture on her nomination by a 53–47 vote.[105][106] Later that day, she was confirmed by the same margin.[107] Republicans Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins joined all Democrats in confirming Jackson to the Supreme Court.[108] She received her judicial commission as an associate justice on April 8.[27] She was sworn in and became an associate justice at noon on June 30, 2022, when Breyer's retirement went into effect.[109][110][111][112]\n\n\n\n## U. S. Supreme Court (2022–present)[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court released its final merit opinions on the morning of June 30, 2022. At noon, Breyer officially retired and Jackson was sworn in, becoming the first Black woman[13][11] and the first former federal public defender to serve on the Supreme Court.[113][114][115][116]\n\n\nOn July 21, Jackson voted on her first Supreme Court case, joining the dissent in a 5–4 decision refusing to block a district court ruling that prevented the Biden administration from setting new enforcement priorities for immigrants entering the U.S. or living in the country illegally.[117] She participated in her first oral argument as an associate justice on October 3, in *Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency*.[118] On November 7 she wrote her first opinion, a two-page dissent from a denial of review in the case of a death row inmate in *Chinn v. Shoop*; the opinion was joined by Justice Sotomayor.[119]\n\n\nTwo contributors to *SCOTUSBlog* noted that, since joining the Court at the beginning of the 2022 term, Jackson was the most active participant in oral arguments, speaking an average of 1,350 words per argument, while the eight other justices each spoke on average fewer than 1,000.[120] On February 28, 2023, Jackson authored her first majority opinion for a unanimous court in *Delaware v. Pennsylvania*, which involved how unclaimed money from MoneyGrams are distributed among individual states.[121]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2022, Jackson was assigned as the circuit justice for the First Circuit.[122]\n\n\n\n### Labor disputes[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, Jackson wrote the sole dissenting opinion in Glacier Northwest, Inc. v. Teamsters, concerning the power of employers to sue labor unions regarding the destruction of employer property following a strike. She wrote that the majority's decision failed \"Congress's intent with respect to the Board's primary role in adjudicating labor disputes\" and ran the risk of potential \"erosion of the right to strike\".[123]\n\n\n\n### Judicial philosophy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Jackson at the James B. Parsons Legacy Dinner on February 24, 2020\nJackson says she does not have a particular judicial philosophy;[124] instead, she says she has a perspective on legal analysis or a \"judicial methodology\".[125][126] Though she has not embraced the label, Jackson has expressed that she sees value in originalism, saying the \"Constitution is fixed in its meaning\", and has explicitly criticized living constitutionalism.[126]\n\n\nIn January 2022, *The New York Times* reported that Jackson had \"not yet written a body of appeals court opinions expressing a legal philosophy\" because she had joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in the summer of 2021. However, *The Times* said, Jackson's earlier rulings \"comported with those of a liberal-leaning judge\", including her opinions blocking various Trump administration actions.[8] Additionally, a review of over 500 of her judicial opinions indicated that she would likely be as liberal as Breyer, the justice she replaced.[127]\n\n\nAccording to Sahil Kapur, writing for NBC News, \"Jackson fits well with the Democratic Party and the progressive movement's agenda\" due to her relative youth, background as a public defender, and history of labor-friendly rulings.[128]\n\n\n*Politico* reported that \"Jackson is popular with liberal legal activists looking to replace Breyer with a justice willing to engage in ideological combat with the court's conservatives.\"[129]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Jackson married surgeon Patrick Graves Jackson, whom she met at Harvard College.[130] He is a descendant of Continental Congress delegate Jonathan Jackson[131] and is related to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.[132] The couple have two daughters.[133][134][135] Jackson is a non-denominational Protestant.[136] In a 2017 speech, she said, \"I am fairly certain that if you traced my family lineage back past my grandparents—who were raised in Georgia, by the way—you would find that my ancestors were slaves on both sides.\"[137] Jackson's paternal ancestry can be traced to Houston County, Georgia,[138] while her maternal ancestry can be traced to Calhoun County, Georgia.[139] Through her marriage, Jackson is related to former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.[140]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nJackson is a member of the Judicial Conference Committee on Defender Services as well as Harvard University's Board of Overseers and the Council of the American Law Institute.[141] She also serves on the board of Georgetown Day School[142] and the U.S. Supreme Court Fellows Commission.[143]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2011, she served on the advisory board of Montrose Christian School, a Baptist school.[144] Jackson has served as a judge in several mock trials with the Shakespeare Theatre Company[145][146][147] and for the Historical Society of the District of Columbia's Mock Court Program.[148] In 2018, she presided over a mock trial hosted by Drexel University's Thomas R. Kline School of Law \"to determine if Vice President Aaron Burr was guilty of murdering\" Alexander Hamilton.[149]\n\n\nIn 2017, Jackson presented at the University of Georgia School of Law's 35th Edith House Lecture.[150] In 2018, she was a panelist at the National Constitution Center's town hall on Alexander Hamilton's legacy.[151] In 2020, Jackson gave the Martin Luther King Jr. Day lecture at the University of Michigan Law School[152] and was honored at the University of Chicago Law School's third annual Judge James B. Parsons Legacy Dinner, hosted by the school's Black Law Students Association.[153] In 2022, she received the Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award, presented by Awards Council members Justice Amy Coney Barrett and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.[154][155]\n\n\nJackson became an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority in 2023.[156]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n* Recent Case (1995). \"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) – Scope of Liability after Reves v.
