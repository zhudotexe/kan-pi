Much of the terrain lies between 200 meters (660 ft) and 800 meters (2,600 ft) in elevation.[187] The main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country.[187] The northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad, rolling terrain broken by low, rounded hills.[187]\n\n\nThe southeastern section is more rugged, with a complex mass of ridges and mountain ranges reaching elevations of up to 1,200 meters (3,900 ft).[187] These ranges include the Mantiqueira and Espinhaço mountains and the Serra do Mar.[187] In the north, the Guiana Highlands form a major drainage divide, separating rivers that flow south into the Amazon Basin from rivers that empty into the Orinoco River system, in Venezuela, to the north. The highest point in Brazil is the Pico da Neblina at 2,994 meters (9,823 ft), and the lowest is the Atlantic Ocean.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n267. **^** \"List of importing markets for the product exported by Brazil in 2021\".

The highest point in Brazil is the Pico da Neblina at 2,994 meters (9,823 ft), and the lowest is the Atlantic Ocean.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n267. **^** \"List of importing markets for the product exported by Brazil in 2021\".

The population comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups (e.g., the Tupis, Guaranis, Gês, and Arawaks). The Tupi people were subdivided into the Tupiniquins and Tupinambás.[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrazil's constitution also provides for the creation of federal territories, which are administrative divisions directly controlled by the federal government. However, there are currently no federal territories in the country, as the 1988 Constitution abolished the last three: Amapá and Roraima (which gained statehood status) and Fernando de Noronha, which became a state district of Pernambuco.[245][246]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Brazil\n\nSee also: Brazilian real, Agriculture in Brazil, Mining in Brazil, and Industry in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nSão Paulo, the largest financial centre in Brazil\n![](image)\nB3, the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization\n![](image)\nSoybean crop in Rondonópolis, Mato Grosso[247]\n![](image)\nThe KC-390, developed by Embraer, the third largest producer of civil aircraft, after Boeing and Airbus[248]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs for oil, the Brazilian government has embarked on a program over the decades to reduce dependence on imported oil, which previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs.

Vietnam shares land borders with China to the north, and Laos and Cambodia to the west.

Comprising five relatively flat plateaus of basalt soil, the highlands account for 16% of the country's arable land and 22% of its total forested land.[180] The soil in much of the southern part of Vietnam is relatively low in nutrients as a result of intense cultivation.[181] Several minor earthquakes have been recorded.[182][183] The northern part of the country consists mostly of highlands and the Red River Delta. Fansipan (also known as Phan Xi Păng), which is located in Lào Cai Province, is the highest mountain in Vietnam, standing 3,143 m (10,312 ft) high.[184] From north to south Vietnam, the country also has numerous islands; Phú Quốc is the largest.[185] The Hang Sơn Đoòng Cave is considered the largest known cave passage in the world since its discovery in 2009. The Ba Bể Lake and Mekong River are the largest lake and longest river in the country.[186][187][188]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe household gas sector in Vietnam is dominated by PetroVietnam, which controls nearly 70% of the country's domestic market for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).[343] Since 2011, the company also operates five renewable energy power plants including the Nhơn Trạch 2 Thermal Power Plant (750 MW), Phú Quý Wind Power Plant (6 MW), Hủa Na Hydro-power Plant (180 MW), Dakdrinh Hydro-power Plant (125 MW) and Vũng Áng 1 Thermal Power Plant (1,200 MW).[344]\n\n\nAccording to statistics from British Petroleum (BP), Vietnam is listed among the 52 countries that have proven crude oil reserves. In 2015 the reserve was approximately 4.4 billion barrels ranking Vietnam first place in Southeast Asia, while the proven gas reserves were about 0.6 trillion cubic metres (tcm) and ranking it third in Southeast Asia after Indonesia and Malaysia.[345]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunication[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Telecommunications in Vietnam\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n272. **^** Ngoc Vo & Le 2014, p. 7. sfn error: no target: CITEREFNgoc\\_VoLe2014 (help)\n273. **^** Van Tho 2003, p. 11.\n274. **^** Litvack, Litvack & Rondinelli 1999, p. 31.\n275. **^** Freeman 2002.\n276. **^** Litvack, Litvack & Rondinelli 1999, p. 33.\n277. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Van Tho 2003, p. 5.\n278. **^** Hoang Vuong & Dung Tran 2009.\n279. **^** Hoang Vuong 2014.\n280. **^** Largo 2002, p. 66.\n281. **^** International Monetary Fund 1999, p. 23. sfn error: no target: CITEREFInternational\\_Monetary\\_Fund1999 (help)\n282. **^** Cockburn 1994.\n283. **^** Pincus 2015, p. 27; this article refers to the so-called \"Vent for surplus\" theory of international trade.\n284. **^** Quang Vinh, p. 13.\n285. **^** \"WTO | Accessions: Viet Nam\". *www.wto.org*.\n286. **^** Asian Development Bank 2010, p. 388.\n287. **^** Thanh Niên 2010.\n288. **^** Vierra & Vierra 2011, p. 5.\n289. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Vandemoortele & Bird 2010.\n290. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Cuong Le et al. 2010, p. 23.\n291. **^** H.

However, the last individual of the species in Vietnam was reportedly shot in 2010.[202] In agricultural genetic diversity, Vietnam is one of the world's twelve original cultivar centres. The Vietnam National Cultivar Gene Bank preserves 12,300 cultivars of 115 species.[197] The Vietnamese government spent US$49.07 million on the preservation of biodiversity in 2004 alone and has established 126 conservation areas, including 30 national parks.[197]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA study also shows that rural-to-urban area migrants have a higher standard of living than both non-migrants in rural areas and non-migrants in urban areas. This results in changes to economic structures. In 1985, agriculture made up 37.2% of Vietnam's GDP; in 2008, that number had declined to 18.5%.[398] In 1985, industry made up only 26.2% of Vietnam's GDP; by 2008, that number had increased to 43.2%. Urbanisation also helps to improve basic services which increase people's standards of living. Access to electricity grew from 14% of total households with electricity in 1993 to above 96% in 2009.[398] In terms of access to fresh water, data from 65 utility companies shows that only 12% of households in the area covered by them had access to the water network in 2002; by 2007, more than 70% of the population was connected. Though urbanisation has many benefits, it has some drawbacks since it creates more traffic, and air and water pollution.[398]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Van Nam, Nguyen; de Vries, Peter J.; Van Toi, Le; Nagelkerke, Nico (2005). \"Malaria control in Vietnam: the Binh Thuan experience\". *Tropical Medicine & International Health*. **10** (4): 357–365. doi:10.1111/j.1365-3156.2005.01387.x.

The average growth rate of the urban population has recently increased which is attributed mainly to migration and rapid urbanisation.[2] The dominant Viet or Kinh ethnic group constitute 82,085,826 people or 85.32% of the population.[2] Most of their population is concentrated in the country's alluvial deltas and coastal plains. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Cira, Dean; Dastur, Arish; Kilroy, Austin; Lozano, Nancy; et al.

Vietnam shares land borders with China to the north, and Laos and Cambodia to the west. It shares maritime borders with Thailand through the Gulf of Thailand, and the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia through the South China Sea.

This led many of them to leave Vietnam.[393][394]\n\n\n\n### Urbanisation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Vietnam\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![A tree map of Vietnam's exports in 2012](image)Tree map showing Vietnam's exports\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities and municipalities in VietnamSource: 2019 Vietnamese census,[401] National Assembly[note 1]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Hanoi](image)Hanoi | 1 | Ho Chi Minh City | Municipality | 8,993,082 | 11 | Tân Uyên | Bình Dương | 466,053\n | ![Haiphong](image)Haiphong![Cần Thơ](image)Cần Thơ |\n| 2 | Hanoi | Municipality | 8,053,663 | 12 | Nha Trang | Khánh Hòa | 422,601\n |\n| 3 | Haiphong | Municipality | 2,028,514 | 13 | Dĩ An | Bình Dương | 403,760\n |\n| 4 | Cần Thơ | Municipality | 1,235,171 | 14 | Buôn Ma Thuột | Đắk Lắk | 375,590\n |\n| 5 | Da Nang | Municipality | 1,134,310 | 15 | Thanh Hóa | Thanh Hóa | 359,910\n |\n| 6 | Biên Hòa | Đồng Nai | 1,055,414 | 16 | Vũng Tàu | Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu | 357,124\n |\n| 7 | Thủ Đức | Ho Chi Minh City | 1,013,795 | 17 | Bến Cát | Bình Dương | 355,663\n |\n| 8 | Huế | Thừa Thiên Huế | 652,572 | 18 | Thái Nguyên | Thái Nguyên | 340,403\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n5.

Fansipan (also known as Phan Xi Păng), which is located in Lào Cai Province, is the highest mountain in Vietnam, standing 3,143 m (10,312 ft) high.[184] From north to south Vietnam, the country also has numerous islands; Phú Quốc is the largest.[185] The Hang Sơn Đoòng Cave is considered the largest known cave passage in the world since its discovery in 2009. The Ba Bể Lake and Mekong River are the largest lake and longest river in the country.[186][187][188]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe household gas sector in Vietnam is dominated by PetroVietnam, which controls nearly 70% of the country's domestic market for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).[343] Since 2011, the company also operates five renewable energy power plants including the Nhơn Trạch 2 Thermal Power Plant (750 MW), Phú Quý Wind Power Plant (6 MW), Hủa Na Hydro-power Plant (180 MW), Dakdrinh Hydro-power Plant (125 MW) and Vũng Áng 1 Thermal Power Plant (1,200 MW).[344]\n\n\nAccording to statistics from British Petroleum (BP), Vietnam is listed among the 52 countries that have proven crude oil reserves. In 2015 the reserve was approximately 4.4 billion barrels ranking Vietnam first place in Southeast Asia, while the proven gas reserves were about 0.6 trillion cubic metres (tcm) and ranking it third in Southeast Asia after Indonesia and Malaysia.[345]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunication[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Telecommunications in Vietnam\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n272. **^** Ngoc Vo & Le 2014, p. 7. sfn error: no target: CITEREFNgoc\\_VoLe2014 (help)\n273. **^** Van Tho 2003, p. 11.\n274. **^** Litvack, Litvack & Rondinelli 1999, p. 31.\n275. **^** Freeman 2002.\n276. **^** Litvack, Litvack & Rondinelli 1999, p. 33.\n277. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Van Tho 2003, p. 5.\n278. **^** Hoang Vuong & Dung Tran 2009.\n279. **^** Hoang Vuong 2014.\n280. **^** Largo 2002, p. 66.\n281. **^** International Monetary Fund 1999, p. 23. sfn error: no target: CITEREFInternational\\_Monetary\\_Fund1999 (help)\n282. **^** Cockburn 1994.\n283. **^** Pincus 2015, p. 27; this article refers to the so-called \"Vent for surplus\" theory of international trade.\n284. **^** Quang Vinh, p. 13.\n285. **^** \"WTO | Accessions: Viet Nam\". *www.wto.org*.\n286. **^** Asian Development Bank 2010, p. 388.\n287. **^** Thanh Niên 2010.\n288. **^** Vierra & Vierra 2011, p. 5.\n289. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Vandemoortele & Bird 2010.\n290. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Cuong Le et al. 2010, p. 23.\n291. **^** H.

However, the last individual of the species in Vietnam was reportedly shot in 2010.[202] In agricultural genetic diversity, Vietnam is one of the world's twelve original cultivar centres. The Vietnam National Cultivar Gene Bank preserves 12,300 cultivars of 115 species.[197] The Vietnamese government spent US$49.07 million on the preservation of biodiversity in 2004 alone and has established 126 conservation areas, including 30 national parks.[197]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA study also shows that rural-to-urban area migrants have a higher standard of living than both non-migrants in rural areas and non-migrants in urban areas. This results in changes to economic structures. In 1985, agriculture made up 37.2% of Vietnam's GDP; in 2008, that number had declined to 18.5%.[398] In 1985, industry made up only 26.2% of Vietnam's GDP; by 2008, that number had increased to 43.2%. Urbanisation also helps to improve basic services which increase people's standards of living. Access to electricity grew from 14% of total households with electricity in 1993 to above 96% in 2009.[398] In terms of access to fresh water, data from 65 utility companies shows that only 12% of households in the area covered by them had access to the water network in 2002; by 2007, more than 70% of the population was connected. Though urbanisation has many benefits, it has some drawbacks since it creates more traffic, and air and water pollution.[398]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Van Nam, Nguyen; de Vries, Peter J.; Van Toi, Le; Nagelkerke, Nico (2005). \"Malaria control in Vietnam: the Binh Thuan experience\". *Tropical Medicine & International Health*. **10** (4): 357–365. doi:10.1111/j.1365-3156.2005.01387.x.

Consumption expenditure by households is the largest component of GDP.[221][31][222]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIncluding Spanish, a total of 101 languages are listed for Colombia in the Ethnologue database. The specific number of spoken languages varies slightly since some authors consider as different languages what others consider to be varieties or dialects of the same language. Best estimates recorded 71 languages that are spoken in-country today – most of which belong to the Chibchan, Tucanoan, Bora–Witoto, Guajiboan, Arawakan, Cariban, Barbacoan, and Saliban language families. There are currently about 850,000 speakers of native languages.[298][299]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human biological diversity and ethnicity in Colombia\n\nHuman biological diversity and ethnicity-**2018 Census** [2]\n\n\n\nWhite and Mestizo (87.58%)\nAfro-Colombian (includes Mixed) (6.68%)\nAmerindian (4.31%)\nNot Stated (1.35%)\nRaizal (0.06%)\nPalenquero (0.02%)\nRomani (0.01%)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Topographic map of Colombia\nThe geography of Colombia is characterized by its six main natural regions that present their own unique characteristics, from the Andes mountain range region shared with Ecuador and Venezuela; the Pacific Coastal region shared with Panama and Ecuador; the Caribbean coastal region shared with Venezuela and Panama; the *Llanos* (plains) shared with Venezuela; the Amazon rainforest region shared with Venezuela, Brazil, Peru and Ecuador; to the insular area, comprising islands in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.[160] It shares its maritime limits with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.[161]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nColombia is ethnically diverse, its people descending from the original Amerindian inhabitants, Spanish colonists, Africans originally brought to the country as slaves, and 20th-century immigrants from Europe and the Middle East, all contributing to a diverse cultural heritage.[300] The demographic distribution reflects a pattern that is influenced by colonial history.[301] Whites live all throughout the country, mainly in urban centers and the burgeoning highland and coastal cities. The populations of the major cities also include mestizos. Mestizo *campesinos* (people living in rural areas) also live in the Andean highlands where some Spanish conquerors mixed with the women of Amerindian chiefdoms. Mestizos include artisans and small tradesmen that have played a major part in the urban expansion of recent decades.[302]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNon-traditional exports have boosted the growth of Colombian foreign sales as well as the diversification of destinations of export thanks to new free trade agreements.[240] Recent economic growth has led to a considerable increase of new millionaires, including the new entrepreneurs, Colombians with a net worth exceeding US$1 billion.[241][242]\n\n\nIn 2017, however, the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) reported that 26.9% of the population were living below the poverty line, of which 7.4% were in \"extreme poverty\". The multidimensional poverty rate stands at 17.0 percent of the population.[8] The Government has also been developing a process of financial inclusion within the country's most vulnerable population.[243]\n\n\nThe contribution of tourism to GDP was US$5,880.3bn (2.0% of total GDP) in 2016. Tourism generated 556,135 jobs (2.5% of total employment) in 2016.[244] Foreign tourist visits were predicted to have risen from 0.6 million in 2007 to 4 million in 2017.[245][246]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n250. **^** COMO FUNCIONA A INDUSTRIA DE FLORES NA COLOMBIA – MAIOR EXPORTADOR MUNDIAL\n251. **^** Colombian exports, by OEC\n252. **^** \"Primary Coal Exports\".

It is the only country in South America with coastlines (and islands) along both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Colombia is a key member of major global and regional organizations including the UN, the WTO, the OECD, the OAS, the Pacific Alliance and the Andean Community; it is also a NATO Global Partner.[30] Its diversified economy is the third-largest in South America, with macroeconomic stability and favorable long-term growth prospects.[31][32]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEast of the Andes lies the savanna of the *Llanos*, part of the Orinoco River basin, and in the far southeast, the jungle of the Amazon rainforest. Together these lowlands make up over half Colombia's territory, but they contain less than 6% of the population. To the north the Caribbean coast, home to 21.9% of the population and the location of the major port cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena, generally consists of low-lying plains, but it also contains the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range, which includes the country's tallest peaks (Pico Cristóbal Colón and Pico Simón Bolívar), and the La Guajira Desert. By contrast the narrow and discontinuous Pacific coastal lowlands, backed by the Serranía de Baudó mountains, are sparsely populated and covered in dense vegetation. The principal Pacific port is Buenaventura.[160][163][164]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nColombia's market economy grew steadily in the latter part of the 20th century, with gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at an average rate of over 4% per year between 1970 and 1998. The country suffered a recession in 1999 (the first full year of negative growth since the Great Depression), and the recovery from that recession was long and painful. However, in recent years growth has been impressive, reaching 6.9% in 2007, one of the highest rates of growth in Latin America.[26] According to International Monetary Fund estimates, in 2012, Colombia's GDP (PPP) was US$500 billion (28th in the world and third in South America).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt 2,600 m (8,530 ft), Bogotá is the highest city of its size in the world.[160]\n\n\nThe main rivers of Colombia are Magdalena, Cauca, Guaviare, Atrato, Meta, Putumayo and Caquetá. Colombia has four main drainage systems: the Pacific drain, the Caribbean drain, the Orinoco Basin and the Amazon Basin. The Orinoco and Amazon Rivers mark limits with Colombia to Venezuela and Peru respectively.[166]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Colombia\n\n![](image)Colombia map of Köppen climate classification\nThe climate of Colombia is characterized for being tropical presenting variations within six natural regions and depending on the altitude, temperature, humidity, winds and rainfall.[167] Colombia has a diverse range of climate zones, including tropical rainforests, savannas, steppes, deserts and mountain climates.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nColombia is rich in natural resources, and it is heavily dependent on energy and mining exports.[236] Colombia's main exports include mineral fuels, oils, distillation products, fruit and other agricultural products, sugars and sugar confectionery, food products, plastics, precious stones, metals, forest products, chemical goods, pharmaceuticals, vehicles, electronic products, electrical equipment, perfumery and cosmetics, machinery, manufactured articles, textile and fabrics, clothing and footwear, glass and glassware, furniture, prefabricated buildings, military products, home and office material, construction equipment, software, among others.[237] Principal trading partners are the United States, China, the European Union and some Latin American countries.[238][239]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 10 | Bello | Antioquia | 495,483 | 20 | Armenia | Quindío | 287,245\n |\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Colombia\n\nSee also: Festivals in Colombia and Colombian folklore\n\nColombia lies at the crossroads of Latin America and the broader American continent, and as such has been hit by a wide range of cultural influences. Native American, Spanish and other European, African, American, Caribbean, and Middle Eastern influences, as well as other Latin American cultural influences, are all present in Colombia's modern culture. Urban migration, industrialization, globalization, and other political, social and economic changes have also left an impression.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMany national symbols, both objects and themes, have arisen from Colombia's diverse cultural traditions and aim to represent what Colombia, and the Colombian people, have in common. Cultural expressions in Colombia are promoted by the government through the Ministry of Culture.[340]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n237. **^** \"International Trade Centre: Colombia Exports\". intracen.org.

It is the only country in South America with coastlines (and islands) along both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Colombia is a key member of major global and regional organizations including the UN, the WTO, the OECD, the OAS, the Pacific Alliance and the Andean Community; it is also a NATO Global Partner.[30] Its diversified economy is the third-largest in South America, with macroeconomic stability and favorable long-term growth prospects.[31][32]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEast of the Andes lies the savanna of the *Llanos*, part of the Orinoco River basin, and in the far southeast, the jungle of the Amazon rainforest. Together these lowlands make up over half Colombia's territory, but they contain less than 6% of the population. To the north the Caribbean coast, home to 21.9% of the population and the location of the major port cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena, generally consists of low-lying plains, but it also contains the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range, which includes the country's tallest peaks (Pico Cristóbal Colón and Pico Simón Bolívar), and the La Guajira Desert. By contrast the narrow and discontinuous Pacific coastal lowlands, backed by the Serranía de Baudó mountains, are sparsely populated and covered in dense vegetation. The principal Pacific port is Buenaventura.[160][163][164]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nColombia's market economy grew steadily in the latter part of the 20th century, with gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at an average rate of over 4% per year between 1970 and 1998. The country suffered a recession in 1999 (the first full year of negative growth since the Great Depression), and the recovery from that recession was long and painful. However, in recent years growth has been impressive, reaching 6.9% in 2007, one of the highest rates of growth in Latin America.[26] According to International Monetary Fund estimates, in 2012, Colombia's GDP (PPP) was US$500 billion (28th in the world and third in South America).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt 2,600 m (8,530 ft), Bogotá is the highest city of its size in the world.[160]\n\n\nThe main rivers of Colombia are Magdalena, Cauca, Guaviare, Atrato, Meta, Putumayo and Caquetá. Colombia has four main drainage systems: the Pacific drain, the Caribbean drain, the Orinoco Basin and the Amazon Basin. The Orinoco and Amazon Rivers mark limits with Colombia to Venezuela and Peru respectively.[166]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Colombia\n\n![](image)Colombia map of Köppen climate classification\nThe climate of Colombia is characterized for being tropical presenting variations within six natural regions and depending on the altitude, temperature, humidity, winds and rainfall.[167] Colombia has a diverse range of climate zones, including tropical rainforests, savannas, steppes, deserts and mountain climates.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nColombia is rich in natural resources, and it is heavily dependent on energy and mining exports.[236] Colombia's main exports include mineral fuels, oils, distillation products, fruit and other agricultural products, sugars and sugar confectionery, food products, plastics, precious stones, metals, forest products, chemical goods, pharmaceuticals, vehicles, electronic products, electrical equipment, perfumery and cosmetics, machinery, manufactured articles, textile and fabrics, clothing and footwear, glass and glassware, furniture, prefabricated buildings, military products, home and office material, construction equipment, software, among others.[237] Principal trading partners are the United States, China, the European Union and some Latin American countries.[238][239]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 10 | Bello | Antioquia | 495,483 | 20 | Armenia | Quindío | 287,245\n |\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Colombia\n\nSee also: Festivals in Colombia and Colombian folklore\n\nColombia lies at the crossroads of Latin America and the broader American continent, and as such has been hit by a wide range of cultural influences. Native American, Spanish and other European, African, American, Caribbean, and Middle Eastern influences, as well as other Latin American cultural influences, are all present in Colombia's modern culture. Urban migration, industrialization, globalization, and other political, social and economic changes have also left an impression.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMany national symbols, both objects and themes, have arisen from Colombia's diverse cultural traditions and aim to represent what Colombia, and the Colombian people, have in common. Cultural expressions in Colombia are promoted by the government through the Ministry of Culture.[340]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n237. **^** \"International Trade Centre: Colombia Exports\". intracen.org.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) identified 140 species of mammals as threatened and 15 as critically endangered, including the Bali myna,[116] Sumatran orangutan,[117] and Javan rhinoceros.[118] Some academics describe the deforestation and other environmental destruction in the country as an ecocide.[119][120][121]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite guaranteeing religious freedom in the constitution,[242][126] the government officially recognises only six religions: Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism,[243][244] with indigenous religions only partly acknowledged.[244] With 231 million adherents (86.7%) in 2018, Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority country,[245][246] with Sunnis being the majority (99%).[247] The Shias and Ahmadis, respectively, constitute 1% (1–3 million) and 0.2% (200,000–400,000) of Muslims.[244][248] About 10% of Indonesians are Christians, who form the majority in several provinces in eastern Indonesia.[249] Most Hindus are Balinese,[250] and most Buddhists are Chinese Indonesians.[251]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Countriesand territories\n | * Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Central African Republic\n* Northern Cyprus1\n* Russia\n* Thailand\n |\n| Muslimcommunities\n | * Moro National Liberation Front\n |\n| Internationalorganizations\n | * Economic Cooperation Organization\n* African Union\n* Arab League\n* Non-Aligned Movement\n* United Nations\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| History | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Declarations | * Abuja Declaration (1989)\n* Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam (1990)\n* OIC Resolution 10/11 (2008)\n* OIC Council of Foreign Ministers Resolution 10/37 (2010)\n |\n\n |\n| Sessions | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Extraordinary | * First\n* Second\n* Third\n* Fourth\n* Fifth\n* Sixth\n* Seventh\n* Eighth\n* Ninth\n* Arab–Islamic (2023)\n |\n\n |\n| Demographics | * Economy\n\t+ GDP\n\t+ GDP per capita\n\t+ Exports\n\t+ Imports\n* Population\n* Largest cities\n* Education\n |\n| * 1 As the \"Turkish Cypriot State\".\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Organizations | * NAM News Network (News Agencies Pool)\n* \"Josip Broz Tito\" Art Gallery of the Nonaligned Countries\n |\n| Principles | * Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence\n |\n| Summits | * Bandung Conference\n* Brioni Meeting\n* 1st\n* 2nd\n* 3rd\n* 4th\n* 5th\n* 6th\n* 7th\n* 8th\n* 9th\n* 10th\n* 16th\n* 18th\n* 19th\n |\n| Founders | * Josip Broz Tito (Yugoslavia)\n* Sukarno (Indonesia)\n* Jawaharlal Nehru (India)\n* Kwame Nkrumah (Ghana)\n* Gamal Abdel Nasser (Egypt)\n |\n| People | * Houari Boumediene\n* Fidel Castro\n* Nelson Mandela\n* Mohamed Morsi\n* Nicolás Maduro\n* Sirimavo Bandaranaike\n |\n\n |\n| ‡ denotes a former member state of the Non-Aligned Movement\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndonesia consists of thousands of distinct native ethnic and hundreds of linguistic groups, with Javanese being the largest. A shared identity has developed with the motto *\"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\"* (\"Unity in Diversity\" *literally*, \"many, yet one\"), defined by a national language, cultural diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. The economy of Indonesia is the world's 16th-largest by nominal GDP and the 7th-largest by PPP. It is the world's third-largest democracy, a regional power and is considered a middle power in global affairs.

Having been long separated from the continental landmasses, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku have developed their unique flora and fauna.[100][101] Papua was part of the Australian landmass and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia, including over 600 bird species.[102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Indonesia signs Aceh peace deal\". *The Guardian*. 15 August 2005.

They are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance.[107] Problems include the destruction of peatlands, large-scale illegal deforestation (causing extensive haze across parts of Southeast Asia), over-exploitation of marine resources, air pollution, garbage management, and reliable water and wastewater services.[107] These issues contribute to Indonesia's low ranking (number 116 out of 180 countries) in the 2020 Environmental Performance Index.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) identified 140 species of mammals as threatened and 15 as critically endangered, including the Bali myna,[116] Sumatran orangutan,[117] and Javan rhinoceros.[118] Some academics describe the deforestation and other environmental destruction in the country as an ecocide.[119][120][121]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite guaranteeing religious freedom in the constitution,[242][126] the government officially recognises only six religions: Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism,[243][244] with indigenous religions only partly acknowledged.[244] With 231 million adherents (86.7%) in 2018, Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority country,[245][246] with Sunnis being the majority (99%).[247] The Shias and Ahmadis, respectively, constitute 1% (1–3 million) and 0.2% (200,000–400,000) of Muslims.[244][248] About 10% of Indonesians are Christians, who form the majority in several provinces in eastern Indonesia.[249] Most Hindus are Balinese,[250] and most Buddhists are Chinese Indonesians.[251]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Countriesand territories\n | * Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Central African Republic\n* Northern Cyprus1\n* Russia\n* Thailand\n |\n| Muslimcommunities\n | * Moro National Liberation Front\n |\n| Internationalorganizations\n | * Economic Cooperation Organization\n* African Union\n* Arab League\n* Non-Aligned Movement\n* United Nations\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| History | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Declarations | * Abuja Declaration (1989)\n* Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam (1990)\n* OIC Resolution 10/11 (2008)\n* OIC Council of Foreign Ministers Resolution 10/37 (2010)\n |\n\n |\n| Sessions | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Extraordinary | * First\n* Second\n* Third\n* Fourth\n* Fifth\n* Sixth\n* Seventh\n* Eighth\n* Ninth\n* Arab–Islamic (2023)\n |\n\n |\n| Demographics | * Economy\n\t+ GDP\n\t+ GDP per capita\n\t+ Exports\n\t+ Imports\n* Population\n* Largest cities\n* Education\n |\n| * 1 As the \"Turkish Cypriot State\".\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Organizations | * NAM News Network (News Agencies Pool)\n* \"Josip Broz Tito\" Art Gallery of the Nonaligned Countries\n |\n| Principles | * Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence\n |\n| Summits | * Bandung Conference\n* Brioni Meeting\n* 1st\n* 2nd\n* 3rd\n* 4th\n* 5th\n* 6th\n* 7th\n* 8th\n* 9th\n* 10th\n* 16th\n* 18th\n* 19th\n |\n| Founders | * Josip Broz Tito (Yugoslavia)\n* Sukarno (Indonesia)\n* Jawaharlal Nehru (India)\n* Kwame Nkrumah (Ghana)\n* Gamal Abdel Nasser (Egypt)\n |\n| People | * Houari Boumediene\n* Fidel Castro\n* Nelson Mandela\n* Mohamed Morsi\n* Nicolás Maduro\n* Sirimavo Bandaranaike\n |\n\n |\n| ‡ denotes a former member state of the Non-Aligned Movement\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndonesia consists of thousands of distinct native ethnic and hundreds of linguistic groups, with Javanese being the largest. A shared identity has developed with the motto *\"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\"* (\"Unity in Diversity\" *literally*, \"many, yet one\"), defined by a national language, cultural diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. The economy of Indonesia is the world's 16th-largest by nominal GDP and the 7th-largest by PPP. It is the world's third-largest democracy, a regional power and is considered a middle power in global affairs.

Large species such as the Sumatran tiger, rhinoceros, orangutan, Asian elephant, and leopard were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically. Having been long separated from the continental landmasses, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku have developed their unique flora and fauna.[100][101] Papua was part of the Australian landmass and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia, including over 600 bird species.[102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Indonesia signs Aceh peace deal\". *The Guardian*. 15 August 2005.

Unlike most countries, coffee is served in presence of social gathering, in family, friend or neighborhood level. There are three rounds of coffee drinking: the first one called \"awol\" (Tigrinya: ኣዎል), the second \"tona\" (ቶና) and the third \"baraka\" (ባርካ). The tradition of coffee legend goes back to Kaldi, a goat herder from Keffa Zone who noticed his goat was caught up with hysteria after they eat shrub that stimulate them to dance uncontrollably with rampant. After holding berries, he was advised exhibit to priests in nearby monastery. One monk called the generosity of Kaldi \"the Devil work\" and tossed to the fire, generating aromatic odor. The legend told that Kaldi lived in 850 CE, commonly associated with belief of starting coffee cultivation in Ethiopia in the 9th century.[249]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethiopian art\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture in Ethiopia\nAgriculture constitutes around 85% of the labour force. However, the service sector represents the largest portion of the GDP.[19] Many other economic activities depend on agriculture, including marketing, processing, and export of agricultural products. Production is overwhelmingly by small-scale farmers and enterprises, and a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural cash-crop sector. Principal crops include coffee, legumes, oilseeds, cereals, potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables. Ethiopia is also a Vavilov centre of diversity for domesticated crops, including enset,[246] coffee and teff.\n\n\nExports are almost entirely agricultural commodities (with the exception of Gold exports), and coffee is the largest foreign exchange earner. Ethiopia is Africa's second biggest maize producer.[247] According to UN estimations the per capita GDP of Ethiopia has reached $357 as of 2011[update].[248]\n\n\n\n### Exports[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** \"Country Level\". *2007 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia*.

In peasant associations daily life is a struggle to survive. About 16% of the population in Ethiopia lives on less than one dollar per day (2008). Only 65% of rural households in Ethiopia consume the World Health Organization's (WHO's) minimum standard of food per day (2,200 kilocalories), with 42% of children under 5 years old being underweight.[294]\n\n\n\n![](image)Addis Ababa seen at nighttime, the financial epicenter of the country\nMost poor families (75%) share their sleeping quarters with livestock, and 40% of children sleep on the floor, where nighttime temperatures average 5 degrees Celsius in the cold season.[294] The average family size is six or seven, living in a 30 square metre mud and thatch hut, with less than two hectares of land to cultivate.[294]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorically, throughout the African continent, wildlife populations have been rapidly declining due to logging, civil wars, pollution, poaching, and other human factors.[223] A 17-year-long civil war, along with severe drought, negatively affected Ethiopia's environmental conditions, leading to even greater habitat degradation.[224] Habitat destruction is a factor that leads to endangerment. When changes to a habitat occur rapidly, animals do not have time to adjust. Human impact threatens many species, with greater threats expected as a result of climate change induced by greenhouse gases.[225] With carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 of 6,494,000 tonnes, Ethiopia contributes just 0.02% to the annual human-caused release of greenhouse gases.[226]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEthiopia loses an estimated 1,410 km2 of natural forests each year due to firewood collection, conversion to farmland, overgrazing, and use of forest wood for building material. Between 1990 and 2005 the country lost approximately 21,000 km2 of forests.[231] Current government programs to control deforestation consist of education, promoting reforestation programs, and providing raw materials which are alternatives to timber. In rural areas the government also provides non-timber fuel sources and access to non-forested land to promote agriculture without destroying forest habitat.[232]\n\n\nOrganizations such as SOS and Farm Africa are working with the federal government and local governments to create a system of forest management.[233]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Ethiopia and Industrial sector in Ethiopia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Declining child mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa and Ethiopia since 1950\nOnly a minority of Ethiopians are born in hospitals, while most are born in rural households. Those who are expected to give birth at home have elderly women serve as midwives who assist with the delivery.[297] The \"WHO estimates that a majority of maternal fatalities and disabilities could be prevented if deliveries were to take place at well-equipped health centres, with adequately trained staff\".[298] Birth rates, infant mortality rates, and death rates are lower in cities than in rural areas due to better access to education, medicines, and hospitals.[290] Life expectancy is better in cities compared to rural areas, but there have been significant improvements witnessed throughout the country as of 2016, the average Ethiopian living to be 62.2 years old, according to a UNDP report.[299] Despite sanitation being a problem, use of improved water sources is also on the rise; 81% in cities compared to 11% in rural areas.[292]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Climate of Ethiopia and Climate change in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Köppen climate classification of Ethiopia\nThe predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The Ethiopian Highlands cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around 2,000–2,500 m (6,562–8,202 ft) above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum. The modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of Mount Entoto at an elevation of around 2,400 metres (7,900 ft). It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September.

However, the service sector represents the largest portion of the GDP.[19] Many other economic activities depend on agriculture, including marketing, processing, and export of agricultural products. Production is overwhelmingly by small-scale farmers and enterprises, and a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural cash-crop sector. Principal crops include coffee, legumes, oilseeds, cereals, potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables.

Lake Tana in the north is the source of the Blue Nile. It also has many endemic species, notably the gelada, the walia ibex and the Ethiopian wolf (\"Simien fox\"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.\n\n\nThe nation is a land of geographical contrasts, ranging from the vast fertile west, with its forests and numerous rivers, to the world's hottest settlement of Dallol in its north. The Ethiopian Highlands are the largest continuous mountain ranges in Africa, and the Sof Omar Caves contains the largest cave on the continent.

First, in 1936–1941 during the Italian occupation under Mussolini's fascist government, and then from 1967 to 1975 when the populations of urban areas tripled.[289]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the Democracy Index published by the United Kingdom-based Economist Intelligence Unit in late 2010, Ethiopia was an \"authoritarian regime\", ranking as the 118th-most democratic out of 167 countries.[177] Ethiopia had dropped 13 places on the list since 2008, and the 2010 report attributed the drop to the government's crackdown on opposition activities, media, and civil society before the 2010 parliamentary election, which the report argued had made Ethiopia a *de facto* one-party state.[178]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Ethiopia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe literacy rate has increased in recent years: according to the 1994 census, the literacy rate in Ethiopia was 23.4%.[276] In 2007 it was estimated to be 39% (male 49.1% and female 28.9%).[312] A report by UNDP in 2011 showed that the literacy rate in Ethiopia was 46.7%. The same report also indicated that the female literacy rate had increased from 27 to 39 per cent from 2004 to 2011, and the male literacy rate had increased from 49 to 59 per cent over the same period for persons 10 years and older.[313] By 2015, the literacy rate had further increased, to 49.1% (57.2% male and 41.1% female).[314]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Ethiopia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBRICS\n |\n| --- |\n| Membership | * ![Brazil](image) Brazil\n* ![Russia](image) Russia\n* ![India](image) India\n* ![China](image) China\n* ![South Africa](image) South Africa\n* ![](image) Egypt Egypt\n* ![](image) Ethiopia\n* ![](image) Iran\n* ![](image) United Arab Emirates\n |\n| Summits | 1.

In peasant associations daily life is a struggle to survive. About 16% of the population in Ethiopia lives on less than one dollar per day (2008). Only 65% of rural households in Ethiopia consume the World Health Organization's (WHO's) minimum standard of food per day (2,200 kilocalories), with 42% of children under 5 years old being underweight.[294]\n\n\n\n![](image)Addis Ababa seen at nighttime, the financial epicenter of the country\nMost poor families (75%) share their sleeping quarters with livestock, and 40% of children sleep on the floor, where nighttime temperatures average 5 degrees Celsius in the cold season.[294] The average family size is six or seven, living in a 30 square metre mud and thatch hut, with less than two hectares of land to cultivate.[294]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorically, throughout the African continent, wildlife populations have been rapidly declining due to logging, civil wars, pollution, poaching, and other human factors.[223] A 17-year-long civil war, along with severe drought, negatively affected Ethiopia's environmental conditions, leading to even greater habitat degradation.[224] Habitat destruction is a factor that leads to endangerment. When changes to a habitat occur rapidly, animals do not have time to adjust. Human impact threatens many species, with greater threats expected as a result of climate change induced by greenhouse gases.[225] With carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 of 6,494,000 tonnes, Ethiopia contributes just 0.02% to the annual human-caused release of greenhouse gases.[226]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEthiopia loses an estimated 1,410 km2 of natural forests each year due to firewood collection, conversion to farmland, overgrazing, and use of forest wood for building material. Between 1990 and 2005 the country lost approximately 21,000 km2 of forests.[231] Current government programs to control deforestation consist of education, promoting reforestation programs, and providing raw materials which are alternatives to timber. In rural areas the government also provides non-timber fuel sources and access to non-forested land to promote agriculture without destroying forest habitat.[232]\n\n\nOrganizations such as SOS and Farm Africa are working with the federal government and local governments to create a system of forest management.[233]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Ethiopia and Industrial sector in Ethiopia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Declining child mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa and Ethiopia since 1950\nOnly a minority of Ethiopians are born in hospitals, while most are born in rural households. Those who are expected to give birth at home have elderly women serve as midwives who assist with the delivery.[297] The \"WHO estimates that a majority of maternal fatalities and disabilities could be prevented if deliveries were to take place at well-equipped health centres, with adequately trained staff\".[298] Birth rates, infant mortality rates, and death rates are lower in cities than in rural areas due to better access to education, medicines, and hospitals.[290] Life expectancy is better in cities compared to rural areas, but there have been significant improvements witnessed throughout the country as of 2016, the average Ethiopian living to be 62.2 years old, according to a UNDP report.[299] Despite sanitation being a problem, use of improved water sources is also on the rise; 81% in cities compared to 11% in rural areas.[292]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Climate of Ethiopia and Climate change in Ethiopia\n\n![](image)Köppen climate classification of Ethiopia\nThe predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The Ethiopian Highlands cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around 2,000–2,500 m (6,562–8,202 ft) above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum. The modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of Mount Entoto at an elevation of around 2,400 metres (7,900 ft). It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September. The average annual rainfall is approximately 1,200 millimetres (47 in).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEthiopia's main health problems are said to be communicable (contagious) diseases worsened by poor sanitation and malnutrition. Over 58 million people (nearly half the population) do not have access to clean water as of 2023.[300] These problems are exacerbated by the shortage of trained doctors and nurses and health facilities.[301] The World Health Organization's 2006 World Health Report gives a figure of 1,936 physicians (for 2003), which comes to about 2.6 per 100,000.[302]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Increase](image) $1,473[11] (159th) |\n| Gini (2015) | ![Negative increase](image) 35.0[12]medium |\n| HDI (2021) | ![Increase](image) 0.498[13]low (175th) |\n| Currency | Birr (ETB) |\n| Time zone | UTC+3 (EAT) |\n| Driving side | right |\n| Calling code | +251 |\n| ISO 3166 code | ET |\n| Internet TLD | .et |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_PpvFro3V0UKPIwU2Y1POoTXF","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

A 2012 US State Department estimate suggested that between 800,000 and one million Hondurans lived in the United States at that time, nearly 15% of the Honduran population.[43] The large uncertainty about numbers is because numerous Hondurans live in the United States without a visa.

The nation saw a poverty increase of 13.2 percent and in extreme poverty of 26.3 percent in just 3 years.[86] Furthermore, unemployment grew between 2008 and 2012 from 6.8 percent to 14.1 percent.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe CIA Factbook lists Honduras as 97% Catholic and 3% Protestant.[1] Commenting on statistical variations everywhere, John Green of Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life notes that: \"It isn't that ... numbers are more right than [someone else's] numbers ... but how one conceptualizes the group.\"[122] Often people attend one church without giving up their \"home\" church. Many who attend evangelical megachurches in the US, for example, attend more than one church.[123] This shifting and fluidity is common in Brazil where two-fifths of those who were raised evangelical are no longer evangelical and Catholics seem to shift in and out of various churches, often while still remaining Catholic.[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** Schaffer, Kathryn (18 January 2018). \"Gender, Environment and Development in Honduras: An Applied Anthropology Internship\". *Practicing Anthropology*. **22** (3): 25–26. doi:10.17730/praa.22.3.t76310161617758g.

Poor communities typically live in adobe homes, lack material resources, have limited access to medical resources, and live off of basics such as rice, maize and beans.[95]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe ethnic breakdown of Honduran society was 90% Mestizo, 7% American Indian, 2% Black and 1% White (2017).[12] The 1927 Honduran census provides no racial data but in 1930 five classifications were created: white, Indian, Negro, yellow, and mestizo.[108] This system was used in the 1935 and 1940 census.[108] Mestizo was used to describe individuals that did not fit neatly into the categories of white, American Indian, negro or yellow or who are of mixed white-American Indian descent.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause much of the Honduran economy is based on small scale agriculture of only a few exports, natural disasters have a particularly devastating impact. Natural disasters, such as 1998 Hurricane Mitch, have contributed to this inequality as they particularly affect poor rural areas.[87] Additionally, they are a large contributor to food insecurity in the country as farmers are left unable to provide for their families.[87] A study done by Honduras NGO, World Neighbors, determined the terms \"increased workload, decreased basic grains, expensive food, and fear\" were most associated with Hurricane Mitch.[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe rural and urban poor were hit hardest by Hurricane Mitch.[87] Those in southern and western regions specifically were considered most vulnerable as they both were subject to environmental destruction and home to many subsistence farmers.[87] Due to disasters such as Hurricane Mitch, the agricultural economic sector has declined a third in the past twenty years.[87] This is mostly due to a decline in exports, such as bananas and coffee, that were affected by factors such as natural disasters.[87] Indigenous communities along the Patuca River were hit extremely hard as well.[9] The mid-Pataca region was almost completely destroyed.[9] Over 80% of rice harvest and all of banana, plantain, and manioc harvests were lost.[9] Relief and reconstruction efforts following the storm were partial and incomplete, reinforcing existing levels of poverty rather than reversing those levels, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Cameron, Samuel, et al.

Thousands of workers came to the north coast as a result to work in banana plantations and other businesses that grew up around the export industry. Banana-exporting companies, dominated until 1930 by the Cuyamel Fruit Company, as well as the United Fruit Company, and Standard Fruit Company, built an enclave economy in northern Honduras, controlling infrastructure and creating self-sufficient, tax-exempt sectors that contributed relatively little to economic growth. American troops landed in Honduras in 1903, 1907, 1911, 1912, 1919, 1924 and 1925.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Gender Development Index (GDI) was .942 in 2015 with an HDI of .600 for females and .637 for males.[11] Life expectancy at birth for males is 70.9 and 75.9 for females.[11] Expected years of schooling in Honduras is 10.9 years for males (mean of 6.1) and 11.6 for females (mean of 6.2).[11] These measures do not reveal a large disparity between male and female development levels, however, GNI per capita is vastly different by gender.[11] Males have a GNI per capita of $6,254 while that of females is only $2,680.[11] Honduras's overall GDI is higher than that of other medium HDI nations (.871) but lower than the overall HDI for Latin America and the Caribbean (.981).[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to its 2009 coup Honduras widely expanded social spending and an extreme increase in minimum wage.[86] Efforts to decrease inequality were swiftly reversed following the coup.[86] When Zelaya was removed from office social spending as a percent of GDP decreased from 13.3 percent in 2009 to 10.9 recent in 2012.[86] This decrease in social spending exacerbated the effects of the recession, which the nation was previously relatively well equipped to deal with.[86]\n\n\n\n### Economic inequality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Slum in Tegucigalpa\nLevels of income inequality in Honduras are higher than in any other Latin American country.[86] Unlike other Latin American countries, inequality steadily increased in Honduras between 1991 and 2005.[91] Between 2006 and 2010 inequality saw a decrease but increased again in 2010.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Wells, John C.

Honduras's manufacturing sector has not yet developed beyond simple textile and agricultural processing industries and assembly operations. The small domestic market and competition from more industrially advanced countries in the region have inhibited more complex industrialization.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, according to the National Institute of Statistics of Honduras (INE), 73% of the country's population is poor and 53% lives in extreme poverty.[80] The country is one of the most unequal in Latin America.[81]\n![](image)Historical GDP per capita development of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras\n### Poverty[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Honduran people are among the poorest in Latin America; gross national income per capita (2007) is US$1,649; the average for Central America is $6,736.[79]\nHonduras is the fourth poorest country in the Western Hemisphere; only Haiti, Nicaragua, and Guyana are poorer.

A majority of expatriate Hondurans live in the United States. A 2012 US State Department estimate suggested that between 800,000 and one million Hondurans lived in the United States at that time, nearly 15% of the Honduran population.[43] The large uncertainty about numbers is because numerous Hondurans live in the United States without a visa.

Bananas, formerly the country's second-largest export until being virtually wiped out by 1998's Hurricane Mitch, recovered in 2000 to 57% of pre-Mitch levels.

The nation saw a poverty increase of 13.2 percent and in extreme poverty of 26.3 percent in just 3 years.[86] Furthermore, unemployment grew between 2008 and 2012 from 6.8 percent to 14.1 percent.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe CIA Factbook lists Honduras as 97% Catholic and 3% Protestant.[1] Commenting on statistical variations everywhere, John Green of Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life notes that: \"It isn't that ... numbers are more right than [someone else's] numbers ... but how one conceptualizes the group.\"[122] Often people attend one church without giving up their \"home\" church. Many who attend evangelical megachurches in the US, for example, attend more than one church.[123] This shifting and fluidity is common in Brazil where two-fifths of those who were raised evangelical are no longer evangelical and Catholics seem to shift in and out of various churches, often while still remaining Catholic.[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** Schaffer, Kathryn (18 January 2018). \"Gender, Environment and Development in Honduras: An Applied Anthropology Internship\". *Practicing Anthropology*. **22** (3): 25–26. doi:10.17730/praa.22.3.t76310161617758g.

Banana-exporting companies, dominated until 1930 by the Cuyamel Fruit Company, as well as the United Fruit Company, and Standard Fruit Company, built an enclave economy in northern Honduras, controlling infrastructure and creating self-sufficient, tax-exempt sectors that contributed relatively little to economic growth.

With respect to the last inter-censal period (September 2002), the population increased by 10.6 million people in the past 12 years.[211] Uganda's median age of 15 years is the lowest in the world.[138] Uganda has the fifth highest total fertility rate in the world, at 5.97 children born per woman (2014 estimates).[138]\n\n\nThere were about 80,000 Indians in Uganda before Idi Amin required the expulsion of Ugandan-Asians (mostly of Indian origin) in 1972, which reduced the population to as low as 7,000. Many Indians, however, returned to Uganda after Amin's ouster in 1979. Around 90 percent of Ugandan Indians reside in Kampala.[212]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUganda ranked as number 102 among the countries of the world in nominal Gross Domestic Product by the International Monetary Fund with a GDP of 26,349 (US$million).[152] The World Bank ranked Uganda as number 99 in nominal GDP with a GDP of 25,891 (US$million).[153]\nBased on the GDP with purchasing power parity the IMF ranked Uganda as number 86 (91,212 million of current Int$) and the World Bank ranked them 90 (79,889 million of current Int$).[152][153]\n\n\nSince the 1990s, the economy in Uganda is growing. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average of 6.7% annually during the period 1990–2015, whereas real GDP per capita grew at 3.3% per annum during the same period.[154]\n\n\n\n### Poverty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Poverty in Uganda\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Increase](image) $145.157 billion[8] (88th) |\n| • Per capita\n | ![Increase](image) $3,222[8] (172nd) |\n| GDP (nominal) | 2023 estimate |\n| • Total\n | ![Increase](image) $52.390 billion[8] (90th) |\n| • Per capita\n | ![Increase](image) $1,163[8] (196th) |\n| Gini (2016) | ![Negative increase](image) 42.0[9]medium |\n| HDI (2021) | ![Increase](image) 0.525[10]low (167th) |\n| Currency | Ugandan shilling (UGX) |\n| Time zone | UTC+3 (EAT) |\n| Driving side | left |\n| Calling code | +256a |\n| ISO 3166 code | UG |\n| Internet TLD | .ug |\n| 1. +006 from Kenya and Tanzania.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Coffee fields in southwestern Uganda\nWith the Uganda securities exchanges established in 1996, several equities have been listed.

The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria, shared with Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda is in the African Great Lakes region, lies within the Nile basin, and has a varied but generally modified equatorial climate. As of 2023, it has a population of around 49.6 million, of which 8.5 million live in the capital and largest city of Kampala.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n134. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Uganda's oil rush: Derricks in the darkness Archived 27 February 2023 at the Wayback Machine.

These include hydropower, biomass, solar, geothermal, peat and fossil fuels.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the majority of energy in Uganda came from charcoal and wood. However, oil was found in the Lake Albert area, totaling an estimated 95 million cubic metres (3.4×10~~^~~9 cu ft) of crude.[134] Heritage Oil discovered one of the largest crude oil finds in Uganda, and continues operations there.[172]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUganda has a large diaspora, residing mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom. This diaspora has contributed enormously to Uganda's economic growth through remittances and other investments (especially property). According to the World Bank, Uganda received in 2016 an estimated US$1.099 billion in remittances from abroad, second only to Kenya (US$1.574 billion) in the East African Community,[145] and seventh in Africa.[146] Uganda also serves as an economic hub for a number of neighbouring countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo,[147] South Sudan,[148] and Rwanda.[149]\n\n\nThe Ugandan Bureau of Statistics announced inflation was 4.6 percent in November 2016.[150] On 29 June 2018, Uganda's statistics agency said the country registered a drop in inflation to 3.4 percent in the financial year ending 2017/18 compared to the 5.7 percent recorded in the financial year 2016/17.[151]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUganda is one of the poorest nations in the world. In 2012, 37.8 percent of the population lived on less than $1.25 a day.[155] Despite making enormous progress in reducing the countrywide poverty incidence from 56 percent of the population in 1992 to 24.5 percent in 2009, poverty remains deep-rooted in the country's rural areas, which are home to 84 percent of Ugandans.[156]\n\n\nPeople in rural areas of Uganda depend on farming as the main source of income and 90 per cent of all rural women work in the agricultural sector.[157] In addition to agricultural work, rural women are responsible for the caretaking of their families. The average Ugandan woman spends 9 hours a day on domestic tasks, such as preparing food and clothing, fetching water and firewood, and caring for the elderly, the sick as well as orphans. As such, women on average work longer hours than men, between 12 and 18 hours per day, with a mean of 15 hours, as compared to men, who work between 8 and 10 hours a day.[158]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * APRM\n* Foreign relations\n* African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights\n* African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights\n* Enlargement\n* United States Africa Command (United States military bases)\n* United States ambassadors\n* African Union–Ethiopia relations\n |\n| Symbols | * Anthem\n* Emblem\n* Flag\n* Passport\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | * Currencies (Gold standard)\n* Development Bank\n* African Economic Community\n* NEPAD\n* African Continental Free Trade Area\n* Single African Air Transport Market\n |\n| Culture | * Africa Day\n |\n| Theory | * Afro\n* United States of Africa\n* United States of Latin Africa\n* East African Federation\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOrganisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Secretary-General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation: Hissein Brahim Taha\n |\n| Member states | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n169. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Q1-Market Report 2015\" (PDF). *Reports & Surveys*.

Furthermore, some groups attempt to restore Ankole as one of the officially recognised traditional kingdoms, to no avail yet.[129] Several other kingdoms and chiefdoms are officially recognised by the government, including the union of Alur chiefdoms, the Iteso paramount chieftaincy, the paramount chieftaincy of Lango and the Padhola state.[130]\n\n\n\n## Economy and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Uganda, Energy in Uganda, and Agriculture in Uganda\n\n![](image)2012 Graphical depiction of Uganda's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.\nThe Bank of Uganda is the central bank of Uganda and handles monetary policy along with the printing of the Ugandan shilling.[131]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Students in Uganda\nAt the 2002 census, Uganda had a literacy rate of 66.8 percent (76.8 percent male and 57.7 percent female).[138] Public spending on education was at 5.2 percent of the 2002–2005 GDP.[183]\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], the NCHE website listed 46 private accredited universities.[184] to mention a few, Makerere University, Mbarara University of science and technology, Kyambogo University, Gulu University, Uganda Christian University, Kampala international University among many more.\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Health in Uganda and HIV/AIDS in Uganda\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nCountries and territories of Africa\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Algeria\n* Angola\n* Benin\n* Botswana\n* Burkina Faso\n* Burundi\n* Cameroon\n* Cape Verde\n* Central African Republic\n* Chad\n* Comoros\n* Democratic Republic of the Congo\n* Republic of the Congo\n* Djibouti\n* Egypt (partly in Asia)\n* Equatorial Guinea\n* Eritrea\n* Eswatini\n* Ethiopia\n* Gabon\n* The Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Guinea\n* Guinea-Bissau\n* Ivory Coast\n* Kenya\n* Lesotho\n* Liberia\n* Libya\n* Madagascar\n* Malawi\n* Mali\n* Mauritania\n* Mauritius\n* Morocco\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Niger\n* Nigeria\n* Rwanda\n* São Tomé and Príncipe\n* Senegal\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Somalia\n* South Africa\n* South Sudan\n* Sudan\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tunisia\n* Uganda\n* Zambia\n* Zimbabwe\n | ![](image)\n |\n| States with limitedrecognition\n | * Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (unclear sovereignty)\n* Somaliland\n |\n| Dependentterritories\n | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| France | * Îles Éparses\n |\n| United Kingdom | Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha\n |\n\n |\n| African territories fullypart of non-African states | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| France | * Mayotte\n* Réunion\n |\n| Italy | * Pantelleria\n* Pelagie Islands\n |\n| Portugal | * Madeira\n* Savage Islands\n |\n| Spain | * Canary Islands\n* Ceuta\n* Melilla\n* Plazas de soberanía\n |\n| Yemen | * Socotra\n |\n\n |\n| * ![](image) **Category**\n* ![](image) **Africa portal**\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAfrican Union\n |\n| --- |\n| History | * Pan-Africanism\n* Decolonisation of Africa\n* Casablanca Group\n* Monrovia Group\n* African and Malagasy Union\n* Abuja Treaty\n* Sirte Declaration\n* Lome Summit\n* **Organisation of African Unity**\n\t+ Chairperson\n\t+ Secretary General\n |\n| Geography | * Borders\n* Extreme points\n* Member states\n* Regions\n |\n| Organs | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the UNHCR, Uganda hosts over 1.4 million refugees on its soil as of August 2021.[213][214] Most come from neighbouring countries in the African Great Lakes region, particularly South Sudan (68.0 percent) and Democratic Republic of the Congo (24.6%).[214] In August 2021, Uganda received some refugees from Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover.[213]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Uganda\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n154. **^** \"World Development Indicators - DataBank\". *databank.worldbank.org*.

It is also widely used in the police and military forces, which may be a historical result of the disproportionate recruitment of northerners into the security forces during the colonial period. The status of Swahili has thus alternated with the political group in power.[219] For example, Idi Amin, who came from the north-west, declared Swahili to be the national language.[220]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Uganda\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Uganda, the Uganda People's Defence Force serves as the military.

These include hydropower, biomass, solar, geothermal, peat and fossil fuels.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the majority of energy in Uganda came from charcoal and wood. However, oil was found in the Lake Albert area, totaling an estimated 95 million cubic metres (3.4×10~~^~~9 cu ft) of crude.[134] Heritage Oil discovered one of the largest crude oil finds in Uganda, and continues operations there.[172]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUganda has a large diaspora, residing mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom. This diaspora has contributed enormously to Uganda's economic growth through remittances and other investments (especially property). According to the World Bank, Uganda received in 2016 an estimated US$1.099 billion in remittances from abroad, second only to Kenya (US$1.574 billion) in the East African Community,[145] and seventh in Africa.[146] Uganda also serves as an economic hub for a number of neighbouring countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo,[147] South Sudan,[148] and Rwanda.[149]\n\n\nThe Ugandan Bureau of Statistics announced inflation was 4.6 percent in November 2016.[150] On 29 June 2018, Uganda's statistics agency said the country registered a drop in inflation to 3.4 percent in the financial year ending 2017/18 compared to the 5.7 percent recorded in the financial year 2016/17.[151]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUganda is one of the poorest nations in the world. In 2012, 37.8 percent of the population lived on less than $1.25 a day.[155] Despite making enormous progress in reducing the countrywide poverty incidence from 56 percent of the population in 1992 to 24.5 percent in 2009, poverty remains deep-rooted in the country's rural areas, which are home to 84 percent of Ugandans.[156]\n\n\nPeople in rural areas of Uganda depend on farming as the main source of income and 90 per cent of all rural women work in the agricultural sector.[157] In addition to agricultural work, rural women are responsible for the caretaking of their families. The average Ugandan woman spends 9 hours a day on domestic tasks, such as preparing food and clothing, fetching water and firewood, and caring for the elderly, the sick as well as orphans. As such, women on average work longer hours than men, between 12 and 18 hours per day, with a mean of 15 hours, as compared to men, who work between 8 and 10 hours a day.[158]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * APRM\n* Foreign relations\n* African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights\n* African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights\n* Enlargement\n* United States Africa Command (United States military bases)\n* United States ambassadors\n* African Union–Ethiopia relations\n |\n| Symbols | * Anthem\n* Emblem\n* Flag\n* Passport\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | * Currencies (Gold standard)\n* Development Bank\n* African Economic Community\n* NEPAD\n* African Continental Free Trade Area\n* Single African Air Transport Market\n |\n| Culture | * Africa Day\n |\n| Theory | * Afro\n* United States of Africa\n* United States of Latin Africa\n* East African Federation\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOrganisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Secretary-General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation: Hissein Brahim Taha\n |\n| Member states | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n169. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Q1-Market Report 2015\" (PDF). *Reports & Surveys*.

Furthermore, some groups attempt to restore Ankole as one of the officially recognised traditional kingdoms, to no avail yet.[129] Several other kingdoms and chiefdoms are officially recognised by the government, including the union of Alur chiefdoms, the Iteso paramount chieftaincy, the paramount chieftaincy of Lango and the Padhola state.[130]\n\n\n\n## Economy and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Uganda, Energy in Uganda, and Agriculture in Uganda\n\n![](image)2012 Graphical depiction of Uganda's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.\nThe Bank of Uganda is the central bank of Uganda and handles monetary policy along with the printing of the Ugandan shilling.[131]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Students in Uganda\nAt the 2002 census, Uganda had a literacy rate of 66.8 percent (76.8 percent male and 57.7 percent female).[138] Public spending on education was at 5.2 percent of the 2002–2005 GDP.[183]\n\n\nAs of 2020[update], the NCHE website listed 46 private accredited universities.[184] to mention a few, Makerere University, Mbarara University of science and technology, Kyambogo University, Gulu University, Uganda Christian University, Kampala international University among many more.\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Health in Uganda and HIV/AIDS in Uganda\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nCountries and territories of Africa\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Algeria\n* Angola\n* Benin\n* Botswana\n* Burkina Faso\n* Burundi\n* Cameroon\n* Cape Verde\n* Central African Republic\n* Chad\n* Comoros\n* Democratic Republic of the Congo\n* Republic of the Congo\n* Djibouti\n* Egypt (partly in Asia)\n* Equatorial Guinea\n* Eritrea\n* Eswatini\n* Ethiopia\n* Gabon\n* The Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Guinea\n* Guinea-Bissau\n* Ivory Coast\n* Kenya\n* Lesotho\n* Liberia\n* Libya\n* Madagascar\n* Malawi\n* Mali\n* Mauritania\n* Mauritius\n* Morocco\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Niger\n* Nigeria\n* Rwanda\n* São Tomé and Príncipe\n* Senegal\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Somalia\n* South Africa\n* South Sudan\n* Sudan\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tunisia\n* Uganda\n* Zambia\n* Zimbabwe\n | ![](image)\n |\n| States with limitedrecognition\n | * Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (unclear sovereignty)\n* Somaliland\n |\n| Dependentterritories\n | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| France | * Îles Éparses\n |\n| United Kingdom | Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha\n |\n\n |\n| African territories fullypart of non-African states | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| France | * Mayotte\n* Réunion\n |\n| Italy | * Pantelleria\n* Pelagie Islands\n |\n| Portugal | * Madeira\n* Savage Islands\n |\n| Spain | * Canary Islands\n* Ceuta\n* Melilla\n* Plazas de soberanía\n |\n| Yemen | * Socotra\n |\n\n |\n| * ![](image) **Category**\n* ![](image) **Africa portal**\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAfrican Union\n |\n| --- |\n| History | * Pan-Africanism\n* Decolonisation of Africa\n* Casablanca Group\n* Monrovia Group\n* African and Malagasy Union\n* Abuja Treaty\n* Sirte Declaration\n* Lome Summit\n* **Organisation of African Unity**\n\t+ Chairperson\n\t+ Secretary General\n |\n| Geography | * Borders\n* Extreme points\n* Member states\n* Regions\n |\n| Organs | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the UNHCR, Uganda hosts over 1.4 million refugees on its soil as of August 2021.[213][214] Most come from neighbouring countries in the African Great Lakes region, particularly South Sudan (68.0 percent) and Democratic Republic of the Congo (24.6%).[214] In August 2021, Uganda received some refugees from Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover.[213]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Uganda\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n154. **^** \"World Development Indicators - DataBank\". *databank.worldbank.org*.

Concerning access to improved sanitation, figures have varied widely. According to government figures, it was 70 percent in rural areas and 81 percent in urban areas in 2011,[177] while according to UN figures it was only 34 percent.[178]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)An ethnolinguistic map of Uganda\nSwahili, a widely used language throughout the African Great Lakes region, was approved as the country's second official national language in 2005.[215][216] English was the only official language until the constitution was amended in 2005.[217][138][215][1][218] Although Swahili has not been favoured by the Bantu-speaking populations of the south and south-west of the country, it is an important *lingua franca* in the northern regions. It is also widely used in the police and military forces, which may be a historical result of the disproportionate recruitment of northerners into the security forces during the colonial period. The status of Swahili has thus alternated with the political group in power.[219] For example, Idi Amin, who came from the north-west, declared Swahili to be the national language.[220]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Uganda\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Uganda, the Uganda People's Defence Force serves as the military.

Torture continues to be a widespread practice amongst security organisations. Attacks on political freedom in the country, including the arrest and beating of opposition members of parliament, have led to international criticism, culminating in May 2005 in a decision by the British government to withhold part of its aid to the country. The arrest of the main opposition leader Kizza Besigye and the siege of the High Court during a hearing of Besigye's case by heavily armed security forces – before the February 2006 elections – led to condemnation.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n179. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Republic of Uganda; Ministry of Finance; Planning and Economic Development. \"Poverty Eradication Action Plan (2004/5-2007/8)\" (PDF).

This trend continued during the first two decades of the 20th century. In 1900, the Mexican population was 13.6 million.[249] The 1921 census reported a loss of about 1 million inhabitants. The Mexican Revolution (c. 1910–1920) greatly impacted population increases. The growth rate increased dramatically between the 1930s and the 1980s, when the country registered growth rates of over 3% (1950–1980). The Mexican population doubled in twenty years, and at that rate it was expected that by 2000 there would be 120 million people living in Mexico. Mexico's population grew from 70 million in 1982 to 120 million in 2015.[250]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n182. **^** \"World in 2050 – The BRICs and beyond: prospects, challenges and opportunities\" (PDF).

The OECD also notes that Mexico's budgeted expenses for poverty alleviation and social development is only about a third of the OECD average.[205] This is also reflected by the fact that infant mortality in Mexico is three times higher than the average among OECD nations whereas its literacy levels are in the median range of OECD nations. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMexico is now firmly established as an upper middle-income country. After the slowdown of 2001 the country has recovered and has grown 4.2, 3.0 and 4.8 percent in 2004, 2005 and 2006,[179] even though it is considered to be well below Mexico's potential growth.[180] The International Monetary Fund predicts growth rates of 2.3% and 2.7% for 2018 and 2019, respectively.[175] By 2050, Mexico could potentially become the world's fifth or seventh largest economy.[181][182]\n\n\nThe electronics industry of Mexico has grown enormously within the last decade. Mexico has the sixth largest electronics industry in the world after China, the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Mexico is the second-largest exporter of electronics to the United States where it exported $71.4 billion worth of electronics in 2011.[183] The Mexican electronics industry grew 20% between 2010 and 2011, up from its constant growth rate of 17% between 2003 and 2009.[183] Currently electronics represent 30% of Mexico's exports.[183]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Mexican Stock Exchange building, in Mexico City\n![](image)Headquarters of América Móvil in Mexico City, the largest mobile network operator outside Asia\nAs of April 2018, Mexico has the 15th largest nominal GDP (US$1.15 trillion)[175] and the 11th largest by purchasing power parity (US$2.45 trillion).

Some of Mexico's native culinary ingredients include: maize, tomato, beans, squash, chocolate, vanilla, avocado, guava, chayote, epazote, camote, jícama, nopal, zucchini, tejocote, huitlacoche, sapote, mamey sapote, and a great variety of chiles, such as the habanero and the jalapeño. Most of these names come from the indigenous language of Nahuatl. Tequila, the distilled alcoholic drink made from cultivated agave cacti is a major industry. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMexico is founding member of several international organizations, most notably the United Nations,[133] the Organization of American States,[134] the Organization of Ibero-American States,[135] the OPANAL[136] and the CELAC.[137] In 2008, Mexico contributed over 40 million dollars to the United Nations regular budget.[138] In addition, it was the only Latin American member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development since it joined in 1994 until Chile gained full membership in 2010.[139][140]\n\n\nMexico is considered a regional power[141][142] hence its presence in major economic groups such as the G8+5 and the G-20. Since the 1990s Mexico has sought a reform of the United Nations Security Council and its working methods[143] with the support of Canada, Italy, Pakistan and other nine countries, which form a group informally called the Coffee Club.[144]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mexican Armed Forces and Military history of Mexico\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is not until very recently that the Mexican government began conducting surveys that consider other ethnic groups that live in the country, such as Afro-Mexicans (who comprised 2% of Mexico's population in 2020)[13] or White Mexicans (47%).[259][260] Less numerous groups in Mexico such as Asians and Middle Easterners are also accounted for, with numbers of around 1% each. While Mestizos are a prominent ethnic group in contemporary Mexico, the subjective and ever-changing definition of this category have led to its estimations being imprecise, having been observed that many Mexicans do not identify as Mestizos,[261][262] favoring instead ethnoracial labels such as White or Indigenous due to having more consistent and \"static\" definitions.[263]\n\n\n\n![](image)Regional variation of ancestry according to a study made by Ruiz-Linares in 2014; each dot represents a volunteer, with most coming from south Mexico and Mexico City.[264]\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Mexico\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt ranks poorly on the Global Peace Index,[31] due in large part to ongoing conflict between drug trafficking syndicates. This \"drug war\" has led to over 120,000 deaths since 2006.[32] Mexico is a member of United Nations, the G20, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Organization of American States, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, and the Organization of Ibero-American States.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of Mexico\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 97,864,218[13] Catholics of Mexico constitute in absolute terms the second largest Catholic community in the world, after Brazil's.[297] 47% percent of them attend church services weekly.[298] The feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, is celebrated on 12 December and is regarded by many Mexicans as the most important religious holiday of their country.[299] The denominations Pentecostal also have an important presence, especially in the cities of the border and in the indigenous communities. As of 2010, Pentecostal churches together have more than 1.3 million adherents, which in net numbers place them as the second Christian creed in Mexico. The situation changes when the different Pentecostal denominations are considered as separate entities. Migratory phenomena have led to the spread of different aspects of Christianity, including branches Protestants, Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodox Church.[300]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n136. **^** OPANAL. \"Members\".

This trend continued during the first two decades of the 20th century. In 1900, the Mexican population was 13.6 million.[249] The 1921 census reported a loss of about 1 million inhabitants. The Mexican Revolution (c. 1910–1920) greatly impacted population increases. The growth rate increased dramatically between the 1930s and the 1980s, when the country registered growth rates of over 3% (1950–1980). The Mexican population doubled in twenty years, and at that rate it was expected that by 2000 there would be 120 million people living in Mexico. Mexico's population grew from 70 million in 1982 to 120 million in 2015.[250]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n182. **^** \"World in 2050 – The BRICs and beyond: prospects, challenges and opportunities\" (PDF).

The OECD also notes that Mexico's budgeted expenses for poverty alleviation and social development is only about a third of the OECD average.[205] This is also reflected by the fact that infant mortality in Mexico is three times higher than the average among OECD nations whereas its literacy levels are in the median range of OECD nations. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMexico is now firmly established as an upper middle-income country. After the slowdown of 2001 the country has recovered and has grown 4.2, 3.0 and 4.8 percent in 2004, 2005 and 2006,[179] even though it is considered to be well below Mexico's potential growth.[180] The International Monetary Fund predicts growth rates of 2.3% and 2.7% for 2018 and 2019, respectively.[175] By 2050, Mexico could potentially become the world's fifth or seventh largest economy.[181][182]\n\n\nThe electronics industry of Mexico has grown enormously within the last decade. Mexico has the sixth largest electronics industry in the world after China, the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Mexico is the second-largest exporter of electronics to the United States where it exported $71.4 billion worth of electronics in 2011.[183] The Mexican electronics industry grew 20% between 2010 and 2011, up from its constant growth rate of 17% between 2003 and 2009.[183] Currently electronics represent 30% of Mexico's exports.[183]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Mexican Stock Exchange building, in Mexico City\n![](image)Headquarters of América Móvil in Mexico City, the largest mobile network operator outside Asia\nAs of April 2018, Mexico has the 15th largest nominal GDP (US$1.15 trillion)[175] and the 11th largest by purchasing power parity (US$2.45 trillion).

As of 2010, Pentecostal churches together have more than 1.3 million adherents, which in net numbers place them as the second Christian creed in Mexico. The situation changes when the different Pentecostal denominations are considered as separate entities. Migratory phenomena have led to the spread of different aspects of Christianity, including branches Protestants, Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodox Church.[300]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n136. **^** OPANAL. \"Members\".

Almost 60 percent of the country's area is located within this region.[160] The country has fifty-four hydrographic basins, fifty-two of which are small coastal basins that discharge their waters into the Pacific Ocean. The final two are the endorheic basin of Lake Titicaca, and the Amazon basin, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean. Both are delimited by the Andes mountain range. The Amazon basin is particularly noteworthy as it is the source of the Amazon River, which at 6872 km, is the longest river in the world, and covers 75% of Peruvian territory.

It is also a member of international organizations such as the OAS and the United Nations.[143] Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, a celebrated Peruvian diplomat, served as United Nations Secretary General from 1981 to 1991.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost Peruvian rivers originate in the peaks of the Andes and drain into one of three basins. Those that drain toward the Pacific Ocean are steep and short, flowing only intermittently. Tributaries of the Amazon River have a much larger flow, and are longer and less steep once they exit the *sierra*. Rivers that drain into Lake Titicaca are generally short and have a large flow.[161] Peru's longest rivers are the Ucayali, the Marañón, the Putumayo, the Yavarí, the Huallaga, the Urubamba, the Mantaro, and the Amazon.[162]\n\n\nThe largest lake in Peru, Lake Titicaca between Peru and Bolivia high in the Andes, is also the largest of South America.[163]\nThe largest reservoirs, all in the coastal region of Peru, are the Poechos, Tinajones, San Lorenzo, and El Fraile reservoirs.[164]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Peru\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPeru's distinct geographical regions are mirrored in a language divide between the coast where Spanish is more predominant over the Amerindian languages, and the more diverse traditional Andean cultures of the mountains and highlands. The Indigenous populations east of the Andes speak various languages and dialects. Some of these groups still adhere to traditional Indigenous languages, while others have been almost completely assimilated into the Spanish language. There has been an increasing and organized effort to teach Quechua in public schools in the areas where Quechua is spoken. In the Peruvian Amazon, numerous Indigenous languages are spoken, including Asháninka, Bora, and Aguaruna.[228]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Peru\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe majority of towns, cities, and villages have their own official church or cathedral and patron saint.\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Peru\n\n![](image)National University of San Marcos, in Lima\nPeru's literacy rate is estimated at 92.9% as of 2007; this rate is lower in rural areas (80.3%) than in urban areas (96.3%).[231] Primary and secondary education are compulsory and free in public schools.[175][232]\n\n\nPeru is home to one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the New World. The National University of San Marcos, founded on 12 May 1551, during the Viceroyalty of Peru, is the first officially established and the oldest continuously functioning university in the Americas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Toponyms[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Dependencies | * Falkland Islands / South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\n\t+ UK\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUnion of South American Nations\n |\n| --- |\n| Members | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Full Members | * Bolivia\n* Guyana\n* Suriname\n* Venezuela\n |\n| Suspended Members | * Argentina\n* Brazil\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n* Ecuador\n* Paraguay\n* Peru\n* Uruguay\n |\n\n |\n| Summits | * 2004\n* 2008\n* 2009 Ecuador\n* 2009 Argentina\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n |\n| Topics | * Cusco Declaration\n* Constitutive Treaty\n* President Pro Tempore\n* Secretary General\n* Bank of the South\n* South American Parliament\n* Initiative for Infrastructure Integration of South America\n* Council of South American Defense\n |\n| Related | * Mercosur\n* Andean Community\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAndean Community of Nations\n |\n| --- |\n| Members | * Bolivia\n* Colombia\n* Ecuador\n* Peru\n |\n| Associate members | * Argentina\n* Brazil\n* Chile\n* Paraguay\n* Uruguay\n* Venezuela\n |\n| Observers | * Mexico\n* Panama\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** David E.

Catholic festivities like Corpus Christi, Holy Week and Christmas sometimes blend with Amerindian traditions. Amerindian festivities from pre-Columbian remain widespread; Inti Raymi, an ancient Inca festival, is still celebrated, especially in rural communities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPeru is located on the central western coast of South America facing the Pacific Ocean.

It borders Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil to the east, Bolivia to the southeast, Chile to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The Andes mountains run parallel to the Pacific Ocean; they define the three regions traditionally used to describe the country geographically.[158]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPeru has over 1,800 species of birds (120 endemic), over 500 species of mammals, over 300 species of reptiles, and over 1,000 species of freshwater fishes.[169][170] The hundreds of mammals include rare species like the puma, jaguar and spectacled bear. The Birds of Peru produce large amounts of guano, an economically important export. The Pacific holds large quantities of sea bass, flounder, anchovies, tuna, crustaceans, and shellfish, and is home to many sharks, sperm whales, and whales.[171] The invertebrate fauna is far less inventoried; at least beetles (Coleoptera) have been surveyed in the \"Beetles of Peru\" project, led by Caroline S.

In livestock, Peru is one of the 20 largest producers of chicken meat in the world.[201]\n\n\nAccording to a report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) published in August 2022, half of Peru's population is moderately food insecure (16.6 million people), and more than 20% (6.8 million people), are severely food insecure: they go without food for a whole day, or even several days.[202][203]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Population age pyramid of Peru in 2020.\nWith about 31.2 million inhabitants in 2017, Peru is the fourth most populous country in South America.[214] The demographic growth rate of Peru declined from 2.6% to 1.6% between 1950 and 2000; with the population being expected to reach approximately 42 million in 2050.[215] According to the 1940 Peruvian census, Peru had a population at the time of seven million residents.[216]\n\n\nAs of 2017[update], 79.3% lived in urban areas and 20.7% in rural areas.[217] Major cities include the Lima metropolitan area (home to over 9.8 million people), Arequipa, Trujillo, Chiclayo, Piura, Iquitos, Cusco, Chimbote, and Huancayo; all reported more than 250,000 inhabitants in the 2007 census.[218] There are 15 uncontacted Amerindian tribes in Peru.[219] Peru has a life expectancy of 75.0 years (72.4 for males and 77.7 for females) according to the latest data for the year 2016 from the World Bank.[220]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe country is heavily dependent on mining for the export of raw materials, which represent 60% of exports: in 2019, the country was the second world producer of copper,[192] silver[193] and zinc,[194] eighth world producer of gold,[195] third world producer of lead,[196] the world's fourth largest producer of tin,[197] the fifth world's largest producer of boron[198] and the world's fourth largest producer of molybdenum.[199] – not to mention gas and of oil.

Peru is a net producer of food and one of the major agro-exporting powers in the region. Food insecurity is due to high social inequality and low wages, with Peru's minimum wage being one of the lowest in South America and a large informal sector.

The *sierra* (highlands) is the region of the Andes; it includes the *Altiplano* plateau as well as the highest peak of the country, the 6,768 m (22,205 ft) Huascarán.[159] The third region is the *selva* (jungle), a wide expanse of flat terrain covered by the Amazon rainforest that extends east. Almost 60 percent of the country's area is located within this region.[160] The country has fifty-four hydrographic basins, fifty-two of which are small coastal basins that discharge their waters into the Pacific Ocean. The final two are the endorheic basin of Lake Titicaca, and the Amazon basin, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean. Both are delimited by the Andes mountain range. The Amazon basin is particularly noteworthy as it is the source of the Amazon River, which at 6872 km, is the longest river in the world, and covers 75% of Peruvian territory. Peru contains 4% of the planet's freshwater.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Map of Köppen climate classification zones in Peru\nThe combination of tropical latitude, mountain ranges, topography variations, and two ocean currents (Humboldt and El Niño) gives Peru a large diversity of climates.

These measures failed to achieve their objectives of income redistribution and the end of economic dependence on developed nations.[184]\n\n\nDespite these results, most reforms were not reversed until the 1990s, when the liberalizing government of Alberto Fujimori ended price controls, protectionism, restrictions on foreign direct investment, and most state ownership of companies.[185]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Jorge Chávez International Airport, in Callao\nPeru's road network in 2021 consisted of 175,589 km (109,106 mi) of highways, with 29,579 km (18,380 mi) paved.[206] Some highways in the country that stand out are the Pan American Highway and Interoceanic Highway.

It is also a member of international organizations such as the OAS and the United Nations.[143] Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, a celebrated Peruvian diplomat, served as United Nations Secretary General from 1981 to 1991.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost Peruvian rivers originate in the peaks of the Andes and drain into one of three basins. Those that drain toward the Pacific Ocean are steep and short, flowing only intermittently. Tributaries of the Amazon River have a much larger flow, and are longer and less steep once they exit the *sierra*. Rivers that drain into Lake Titicaca are generally short and have a large flow.[161] Peru's longest rivers are the Ucayali, the Marañón, the Putumayo, the Yavarí, the Huallaga, the Urubamba, the Mantaro, and the Amazon.[162]\n\n\nThe largest lake in Peru, Lake Titicaca between Peru and Bolivia high in the Andes, is also the largest of South America.[163]\nThe largest reservoirs, all in the coastal region of Peru, are the Poechos, Tinajones, San Lorenzo, and El Fraile reservoirs.[164]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Peru\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPeru's distinct geographical regions are mirrored in a language divide between the coast where Spanish is more predominant over the Amerindian languages, and the more diverse traditional Andean cultures of the mountains and highlands. The Indigenous populations east of the Andes speak various languages and dialects. Some of these groups still adhere to traditional Indigenous languages, while others have been almost completely assimilated into the Spanish language. There has been an increasing and organized effort to teach Quechua in public schools in the areas where Quechua is spoken. In the Peruvian Amazon, numerous Indigenous languages are spoken, including Asháninka, Bora, and Aguaruna.[228]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Peru\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe majority of towns, cities, and villages have their own official church or cathedral and patron saint.\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Peru\n\n![](image)National University of San Marcos, in Lima\nPeru's literacy rate is estimated at 92.9% as of 2007; this rate is lower in rural areas (80.3%) than in urban areas (96.3%).[231] Primary and secondary education are compulsory and free in public schools.[175][232]\n\n\nPeru is home to one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the New World.

In the Andes communities of Ancash, Cusco and Puno, Quechua or Aymara names are overwhelmingly predominant. Their Spanish-based orthography, however, is in conflict with the normalized alphabets of these languages. According to Article 20 of *Decreto Supremo No 004-2016-MC* (Supreme Decree) which approves the Regulations to Law 29735, published in the official newspaper El Peruano on 22 July 2016, adequate spellings of the toponyms in the normalized alphabets of the Indigenous languages must progressively be proposed with the aim of standardizing the naming used by the National Geographic Institute *(Instituto Geográfico Nacional, IGN)*. The National Geographic Institute realizes the necessary changes in the official maps of Peru.[233]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Peru\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n230. **^** \"Catholicism and evangelism: the two most common religions in Latin America\". *Statista*. 26 October 2022.

Catholic festivities like Corpus Christi, Holy Week and Christmas sometimes blend with Amerindian traditions. Amerindian festivities from pre-Columbian remain widespread; Inti Raymi, an ancient Inca festival, is still celebrated, especially in rural communities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPeru is located on the central western coast of South America facing the Pacific Ocean. It lies wholly in the Southern Hemisphere, its northernmost extreme reaching to 1.8 minutes of latitude or about 3.3 kilometres (2.1 mi) south of the equator, covers 1,285,216 km2 (496,225 sq mi) of western South America. It borders Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil to the east, Bolivia to the southeast, Chile to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The Andes mountains run parallel to the Pacific Ocean; they define the three regions traditionally used to describe the country geographically.[158]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPeru has over 1,800 species of birds (120 endemic), over 500 species of mammals, over 300 species of reptiles, and over 1,000 species of freshwater fishes.[169][170] The hundreds of mammals include rare species like the puma, jaguar and spectacled bear. The Birds of Peru produce large amounts of guano, an economically important export. The Pacific holds large quantities of sea bass, flounder, anchovies, tuna, crustaceans, and shellfish, and is home to many sharks, sperm whales, and whales.[171] The invertebrate fauna is far less inventoried; at least beetles (Coleoptera) have been surveyed in the \"Beetles of Peru\" project, led by Caroline S. Chaboo, University of Nebraska, USA and this revealved more 12,000 documented and many new species for Peru.[172]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Quechua: *Piruw Ripuwlika*\n\t* Aymara: *Piruwxa Ripuwlika*\n2. **^** The 2017 National Census included, for the first time, a question of ethnic self-identification that was addressed to people aged 12 and over considering elements such as their ancestry, their customs and their family origin to visualize and better understand the cultural reality of the country.\n3. **^**  The question about religion included in the 2017 National Census was addressed to people aged 12 and over.\n4. **^** The government in each department is referred to as \"regional\" governments despite being departments.\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_powSzTE4StxmYuWXUWON3lR6","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
