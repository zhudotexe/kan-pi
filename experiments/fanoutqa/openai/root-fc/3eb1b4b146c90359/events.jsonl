It is officially known as the NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting. The draft was held April 23–24, 2005. The league also held a supplemental draft that year, which was held after the regular draft but before the regular season. The draft took place at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City,[1][2] and was televised for the 26th consecutive year on ESPN and ESPN2. It was the first to be held at the Javits Center after Madison Square Garden was utilized for previous drafts since 1995.[3]\n\n\nThe draft is best known for quarterback Aaron Rodgers falling to the 24th selection after being projected as one of the top picks.[4] Although Rodgers believed he would be taken first overall by the San Francisco 49ers, the 49ers selected quarterback Alex Smith and Rodgers was passed on by teams with other positional needs until he was drafted by the Green Bay Packers.[5][6][7] Rodgers' fall drew retrospective scrutiny due to developing a reputation as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[8][9][10][11]\n\n\nCompensatory selections were distributed amongst fourteen teams, with the Philadelphia Eagles and the St. Louis Rams garnering the most with four picks each.[12] Three of the first five picks were running backs, an NFL draft first.[13]\n\n\nThe 255 players chosen in the draft were composed of:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * 36 Linebackers\n* 31 Wide receivers\n* 29 Cornerbacks\n* 26 Offensive tackles\n* 26 Running backs\n | * 20 Safeties\n* 20 Defensive ends\n* 15 Defensive tackles\n* 15 Offensive guards\n* 14 Quarterbacks\n | * 9 Tight ends\n* 8 Centers\n* 3 Kickers\n* 2 Punters\n* 1 Kick returner\n |\n\n\n\n\n## Player selections[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jump to round\n\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \\*\n | = compensatory selection |  |\n| †\n | = Pro Bowler[14] |\n\n | \n\nPositions key\n| **C** | Center |  | **CB** | Cornerback |  | **DB** | Defensive back |  | **DE** | Defensive end[a] |\n| **DL** | Defensive lineman | **DT** | Defensive tackle | **FB** | Fullback | **FS** | Free safety |\n| **G** | Guard[b] | **K** | Kicker[c] | **KR** | Kickoff returner | **LB** | Linebacker |\n| **LS** | Long snapper | **MLB** | Middle linebacker[d] | **OT** | Offensive tackle | **OL** | Offensive lineman |\n| **OLB** | Outside linebacker[a] | **NT** | Nose tackle | **P** | Punter | **PR** | Punt returner |\n| **QB** | Quarterback | **RS** | Return specialist | **RB** | Running back | **S** | Safety |\n| **SS** | Strong safety | **TE** | Tight end | **WR** | Wide receiver |\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** May sometimes be referred to as an edge rusher (EDGE)\n2. **^** Also known as offensive guard (OG)\n3. **^** Also known as placekicker (PK)\n4. **^** Also known as inside linebacker (ILB)\n |\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n![](image)Quarterback Alex Smith, taken first overall, struggled for his first few years before breaking out as a serviceable starter after 2011 for the San Francisco 49ers and later the Kansas City Chiefs and Washington Football Team.

Brown Jr.** (born December 12, 1981) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). After graduating from Cartersville High School in Georgia, Brown attended Auburn University to play college football for the Auburn Tigers. He and Cadillac Williams shared carries at running back, while he had 1,008 yards and 13 touchdowns in 2002, 446 yards and five touchdowns in 2003, and 913 yards and eight touchdowns in 2004. Brown finished seventh in school history with 2,707 rushing yards and fifth with 28 rushing touchdowns. He twice earned second-team All-Southeastern Conference honors in 2002 and 2004.\n\n\nBrown was drafted second overall by the Miami Dolphins in the 2005 NFL Draft. Brown started at running back for the Dolphins for the first four weeks of the season while Ricky Williams served a suspension, and shared carries with him when he returned in week five. Brown became the feature back in 2006 due to Williams' full year suspension. Brown sat out three games due to a broken hand suffered on Thanksgiving Day in a game against the Detroit Lions, returning in week 16. He played in the first seven games of the 2007 season before suffering a knee injury which knocked him out for the remainder of the season. Williams started over Brown in the first two games of the 2008 season, but shared carries with him after week two. Brown had 916 yards and ten touchdowns in 2008, which led to his first Pro Bowl selection following the season. He was placed on injured reserve for the second straight season after suffering a foot injury in week nine of the 2009 season. Brown rushed for 734 yards and five touchdowns in 2010, as he started in all 16 games. He played for the Philadelphia Eagles in 2011 following a six-year career with the Dolphins.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\nBrown attended Cartersville High School in Georgia, where he was a three-year starter and rushed for 4,936 yards, 12 touchdowns.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brown on the sideline at the 2004 AU–UGA game.\nBrown moved on to Auburn University, where he majored in communications and played for coach Tommy Tuberville's Auburn Tigers football team from 2000 to 2004. He teamed up with speed running back Carnell Williams to create a premier running threat of speed and power. He redshirted after playing in the first two games of the 2000 season as he only gained 10 yards on six carries. In 2001, he played in 10 games and ranked third on the team with 330 yards on 84 carries and two touchdowns while catching seven passes for 109 yards.\n\n\nBrown enjoyed his best season in 2002 when he gained a career-high 1,008 yards on 175 carries (5.8 avg.) with 13 touchdowns while subbing for the injured Williams. He also had nine receptions for 166 yards (18.4 avg.) and a touchdown. However, in 2003, with Williams healthy and starting, Brown's statistics dropped as he carried the ball only 95 times for 446 yards (4.7 avg.), recorded five touchdowns, and had eight receptions for 80 yards.\n\n\nIn 2004, Brown shared duties with Williams and started seven games. Together with Jason Campbell, coach Tommy Tuberville called them the best backfield in the past 30 years as they led the team to a 13-0 record. He totaled 913 yards on 153 carries and scored eight times. He also displayed his receiving capabilities as he ranked second on the team with 34 catches for 313 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\nAlthough he started only 21 of 47 games for Auburn he finished his career ranked seventh in school history with 2,707 yards rushing on 513 carries while ranking fifth with 28 rushing touchdowns. Brown also had 58 receptions for 668 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\nIn 2020, Brown was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.[1]\n\n\n\n### Stats[edit]\n\n\n* 2000: 6 carries for 10 yards and no touchdowns.\n* 2001: 84 carries for 330 yards (3.93) and 2 touchdowns. 7 catches for 109 yards.\n* 2002: 175 carries for 1008 yards (5.76) and 13 touchdowns. 9 catches for 166 yards and 1 touchdown.\n* 2003: 95 carries for 446 yards (4.69) and 5 touchdowns. 8 catches for 80 yards.\n* 2004: 153 carries for 913 yards (5.97) and 8 touchdowns. 34 catches for 313 yards and 1 touchdown.\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPre-draft measurables\n| Height | Weight | Arm length | Hand span | 40-yard dash | 10-yard split | 20-yard split | 20-yard shuttle | Three-cone drill | Vertical jump | Broad jump | Bench press |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 ft 0+1⁄4 in(1.84 m)\n | 233 lb(106 kg)\n | 31+5⁄8 in(0.80 m)\n | 9+5⁄8 in(0.24 m) | 4.48 s | 1.56 s | 2.60 s | 4.08 s | 7.10 s | 34.0 in(0.86 m) | 9 ft 9 in(2.97 m) | 18 reps |\n| All values from NFL Combine[2][3] |\n\n\n### Miami Dolphins[edit]\n\n\nBrown entered the 2005 NFL Draft and was drafted with the second overall pick of the first round by the Miami Dolphins.[4] Fellow Auburn University halfback Carnell Williams was also in the draft and was selected with the fifth pick in the first round by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brown held out of training camp due to a contract dispute and as a result was not successful running the ball in the first two weeks of the season as he rushed for only 93 yards on 34 carries (2.7 avg.) and no touchdowns. However, he got on track in Week 3 as he rushed for 132 yards on 23 carries (5.7 avg.) and his first career touchdown. He followed this up with a successful Week 4 performance rushing for 97 yards on 17 carries (5.7 avg.). But during Week 5, he had to again share rushing duties with another premier running back, this time Ricky Williams who was returning from a four-game suspension. Brown ended up having only about forty more rushes than Williams during the 2005 season, and was well on pace for a 1,000 yard campaign if it wasn't for them sharing the football. Brown ended up with 207 rushes for 907 yards (4.4 avg.) and 4 touchdowns while having 32 receptions for 232 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\nWith Ricky Williams suspended for the entire season, Brown entered 2006 as the feature back for the Miami Dolphins. The offensive line and offense in general struggled for the Dolphins, making it difficult for Brown to consistently produce at a high level. He had a breakout game on October 15 loss to the New York Jets, rushing for 127 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. Three weeks later he rushed for a career-high 157 yards against a stingy Chicago Bears defense, helping the Dolphins to an upset victory of the previously undefeated Bears. On a Thanksgiving Day game against the Detroit Lions, Brown suffered a broken left hand from a hit by a defender's helmet. While he missed the next three contests, Brown returned for the final two games of the season and posted back-to-back 100-yard rushing performances against the Indianapolis Colts and New York Jets. In 13 games played, Brown finished with 1,008 rushing yards, 276 receiving yards, five touchdowns and a solid 4.2 average.\n\n\nDuring the team's minicamp in May 2007, Brown revealed that he was eight pounds over his listed playing weight of 232, and would like to cut his body fat from 12 percent to 8 or 9 percent. During week 7, Ronnie Brown injured his knee making a tackle during an interception return and was lost for the season. At the time of his injury he was leading the league in yards from scrimmage and was on pace for over 2,200 total yards on the season.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brown maneuvers past 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis at the 2009 Pro Bowl.\nBefore the 2008 regular season started, Tony Sparano, announced Ricky Williams would be the starting running back. During the first two games Brown carried the ball 17 times for a total of 48 yards and one touchdown. Before the New England Patriots game Ronnie Brown was made the starting running back and has been featured in the Dolphins' popular Wildcat formation, which borrows from former Auburn University OC Gus Malzahn's college spread offense.[5] Brown rushed for 117 yards, including four rushing scores, while the running back also threw a touchdown pass. Although he split carries with teammate Ricky Williams, Brown still had a solid 2008 season rushing for 916 yards on 214 carries, an average of 4.3 ypc.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brown with the Dolphins in 2009.\nBrown was also selected to the 2009 Pro Bowl as a reserve running back.\n\n\nFor the 2009 NFL season, Brown played and started in nine of the sixteen games of the regular season. During these nine games Brown managed to carry the ball 148 times for a total of 648 yards averaging 4.4 yards per carry. Brown also managed to rush for eight touchdowns. Brown in addition to rushing the ball managed to complete 14 passes for a total of 98 yards. During the 11th week of the regular season; Brown suffered a right foot injury against Tampa Bay and was placed on injured reserve. Brown's injury caused him to miss the remainder of the season.\n\n\nIn 2010, Brown became a restricted free agent, but re-signed with the Dolphins.\n\n\nOn March 19, 2010, Brown was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol outside Atlanta.[6]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia Eagles[edit]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2011, Brown signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles worth $1 million. It was reported that there were incentives in the contract that could take the value over $1 million.[7]\n\n\nThe Eagles traded Brown to the Detroit Lions in exchange for running back Jerome Harrison and a seventh-round draft pick in 2013 on October 18, 2011,[8] but the trade was voided the next day after Harrison failed his physical with the Eagles.\n\n\n\n### San Diego Chargers[edit]\n\n\nBrown signed a one-year contract with the San Diego Chargers on June 8, 2012.[9]\nAfter an injury to starting running back Ryan Mathews in the preseason, Brown started the season opener against the Oakland Raiders on Monday Night Football. While he was ineffective on the ground, gaining just 5 yards on five carries, Brown became the third-down back for the Chargers. On January 5, 2014, Brown sealed a 27–10 win for the Chargers with a 58-yard touchdown run in the wild card playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\n\n\n### Houston Texans[edit]\n\n\nThe Houston Texans signed Brown on August 11, 2014.[10] He was released on October 1, 2014.[11]\n\n\n\n### San Diego Chargers (second stint)[edit]\n\n\nOn October 7, 2014, Brown was signed by the San Diego Chargers, following a concussion suffered by Chargers' running back Donald Brown on October 5. The team had already lost running back Danny Woodhead for the season[12] due to an ankle injury suffered on September 21, 2014, in a game against the Buffalo Bills.[13] The team was also without running back Ryan Mathews who suffered an MCL sprain on September 21 in a game against the Seattle Seahawks and was expected to be out 4–5 weeks.[14] Ronnie Brown played in seven games for the Chargers in the 2014 season. On December 20, 2014 (Week 16), in a game at San Francisco, he played an important role in a 38–35 overtime victory instrumental in keeping San Diego's playoff hopes alive. In overtime, Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers handed off the ball to Brown on six straight plays, as the team moved 22 yards to set up Nick Novak's game-winning fieldgoal.[15] The next week, in the regular-season finale, he didn't record a single carry, as the Chargers lost to the Kansas City Chiefs and didn't make the playoffs. At the end of the season, the San Diego Chargers organization didn't offer him a contract extension.\n\n\n\n## NFL career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| General\n | Rushing\n | Receiving\n | Fum |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Season\n | Team\n | GP | GS | Att | Yards | Y/A | Y/G | TDs | Tgt | Rec | Yards | Y/R | Y/G | TDs |\n| 2005 | MIA | 15 | 14 | 207 | 907 | 4.4 | 60.5 | 4 | 47 | 32 | 232 | 7.3 | 15.5 | **1** | **4** |\n| 2006 | MIA | 13 | 12 | **241** | **1,008** | 4.2 | 77.5 | 5 | 38 | 33 | 276 | 8.4 | 21.2 | 0 | **4** |\n| 2007 | MIA | 7 | 7 | 119 | 602 | **5.1** | **86.0** | **4** | 46 | 39 | **389** | **10.0** | **55.6** | **1** | 0\n |\n| 2008 | MIA | **16** | 13 | 214 | 916 | 4.3 | 57.3 | **10** | 43 | 33 | 254 | 7.7 | 15.9 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2009 | MIA | 9 | 9 | 147 | 648 | 4.4 | 72.0 | 8 | 20 | 14 | 98 | 7.0 | 10.9 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2010 | MIA | **16** | **16** | 200 | 734 | 3.7 | 45.9 | 5 | 43 | 33 | 242 | 7.3 | 15.1 | 0 | 3\n |\n| 2011 | PHI | **16** | 2 | 42 | 136 | 3.2 | 8.5 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | — | 0.0 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2012 | SD | 14 | 1 | 46 | 220 | 4.8 | 15.7 | 0 | **59** | **49** | 371 | 7.6 | 26.5 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2013 | SD | **16** | 0 | 45 | 157 | 3.5 | 9.8 | 1 | 8 | 8 | 60 | 7.5 | 3.8 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2014 | HOU | 3 | 0 | 6 | 4 | 0.7 | 1.3 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 5 | 5.0 | 1.7 | 0 | 0\n |\n| SD | 7 | 0 | 14 | 59 | 4.2 | 8.4 | 0 | 7 | 4 | 39 | 9.8 | 5.6 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Career[16] | 132 | 74 | 1,281 | 5,391 | 4.2 | 40.8 | 38 | 314 | 246 | 1,966 | 8.0 | 14.9 | 2 | 14\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Ronnie Brown\".

He played college football for the Texas Longhorns where he won the 2005 Rose Bowl, was recognized as a consensus All-American and was the Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year in 2001. He was selected by Chicago with the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft and also played for the Cincinnati Bengals and Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBenson began to emerge as a football stand-out in the eighth grade while attending Abell Junior High School in Midland, Texas, under Coach Chris McKinney. Benson attended Robert E. Lee High School in Midland, Texas, and finished his high school playing career with 8,423 rushing yards (the most in Texas 5A history, largest classification at the time, and the fourth most in Texas high school football history).[1] He led his team to three consecutive State Championships, and rushed for a total of 15 touchdowns in the three championship games. Benson rushed for more than 1,900 yards in only 9 games. He rushed for over 3,500 yards (51 touchdowns) his junior year in an undefeated State and National Championship season. He was the first high school player ever to make the cover of Dave Campbell's Texas Football annual magazine. Benson was also a center fielder on the baseball team. As a senior, in District 4-5A games, he hit .361 with 4 home runs and 14 RBIs.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nBenson attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a four-year starter for the Longhorns football team. As a senior in 2004, he received the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top running back and was recognized as a consensus All-American. He finished his college career with 5,540 rushing yards to rank tenth all time in NCAA Division I-A history, and second only to Ricky Williams in Longhorns team history.\n\n\nHe has often been compared to Williams, due to their similarities in running style, college choice, legal complications,[2][3] and superficial appearance (roughly the same size and build coming out of college, and both had dreadlocks early in their careers), and the fact that they had both been minor league baseball players.\n\n\nWhile attending the University of Texas, Benson majored in social work and sociology. During his latter years, he earned membership into the Texas' Athletics Director's Academic Honor Roll, and the Big 12 Commissioner's Honor Roll in fall of 2003. Also, while in college, Benson was arrested twice, once for possession of marijuana and the other for criminal trespass. The marijuana case was dropped after a friend came forward and claimed ownership. He received 8 days in jail for the trespass conviction although he spent no time in jail other than the day of arrest due to overcrowding in Travis County Jail. He was forced to serve a one-half game suspension against Baylor University.[4]\n\n\n\n### College statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Team\n | GP\n | Rushing\n | Receiving\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Att | Yds | Avg | TD | Rec | Yds | TD\n |\n| 2001 | Texas | 12 | 223 | 1,053 | 4.7 | 12 | 17 | 203 | 1\n |\n| 2002 | Texas | 13 | 305 | 1,293 | 4.2 | 12 | 21 | 119 | 0\n |\n| 2003 | Texas | 12 | 258 | 1,360 | 5.3 | 21 | 9 | 120 | 1\n |\n| 2004 | Texas | 12 | 326 | 1,834 | 5.6 | 19 | 22 | 179 | 1\n |\n| Totals[5] | 49 | 1,112 | 5,540 | 5.0 | 64 | 69 | 621 | 3\n |\n\n\n## Professional football career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPre-draft measurables\n| Height | Weight | Arm length | Hand span | 40-yard dash | 10-yard split | 20-yard split | 20-yard shuttle | Three-cone drill | Vertical jump | Bench press |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 ft 10+1⁄2 in(1.79 m)\n | 222 lb(101 kg)\n | 31+3⁄4 in(0.81 m)\n | 9 in(0.23 m) | 4.62 s | 1.60 s | 2.67 s | 4.30 s | 7.50 s | 33.0 in(0.84 m) | 21 reps |\n| All values from NFL Combine/Pro Day[6][7] |\n\n\n### Chicago Bears[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cedric Benson practicing at the Chicago Bears 2007 Training Camp.\nThe Chicago Bears selected Benson in the first round with the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft.[8][9] Benson was visibly upset upon being drafted by Chicago, as the two parties disagreed on contract terms prior to the draft.[9] After a 36-day contract hold-out, Benson and the Bears finally agreed to a five-year contract worth $35 million, with a $16 million signing bonus.[9] The Bears wished to make Benson their feature running back, but his lengthy contract impasse had caused him to miss the team's entire training camp.[10] Benson claimed that he received a cold reception upon his return because he claimed he would be starting by the third game despite holding out and not practicing.[11] Jay Glazer reported that certain players even attempted to intentionally injure him during practice.[12]\n\n\nThe team temporarily made Thomas Jones their featured running back for the beginning of the 2005 season.[10] Jones' performance impressed the Bears' coaching staff, and earned him the top spot on the team's depth-chart for the next two seasons. Benson occasionally received playtime, and he rushed for eighty yards on sixteen carries against the New Orleans Saints during his best game. However, shortly afterwards, he suffered a medial collateral ligament sprain and missed most of the remaining season.[13]\n\n\nAfter the 2005 the Bears considered making Benson the team's starting running back after Jones was unhappy with his current contract status. The team's plans went astray when Benson injured his shoulder after colliding with Brian Urlacher during a routine scrimmage. Although the injury was not serious, it placed Benson on the sidelines for a majority of the preseason.\n\n\nAlthough Benson fully recovered from his injury, head coach Lovie Smith selected Jones as the Bears' starter. Benson scored his first two touchdowns during week five of the 2006 season, against the Buffalo Bills. In a game against the New England Patriots during week twelve of the season, Benson collided with linebacker Junior Seau, causing Seau to fall down and fracture his forearm.\n\n\nDays later, Benson challenged Smith's coaching by remarking, \"the NFL is not like high school or college, but the best players don't always get on the field.\"[14] The following week, Benson out rushed Jones and scored a vital touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings on 4th down. However, when asked about it after the game, he said he didn't know that it was 4th down. He began to receive more carries as the weeks progressed, and managed to rush for over 100 yards against the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\nBenson became the Bears' secondary running back again during the playoffs. In the 2006 NFC Championship game against the New Orleans Saints, Benson scored a fourth-quarter touchdown and totaled 60 yards. Though he was given a majority of the team's carries, his counterpart, Jones, amassed two touchdowns and 123 rushing yards.[15] In the team's following game, Super Bowl XLI, Benson sustained a knee injury in the first half, and missed the remainder of the game.\n\n\nSmith named Benson as the Bears' starting running back after the team traded Jones to the New York Jets. Benson struggled throughout the preseason, but received enough support from his teammates and coaches to retain his starting position.[16] He amassed only forty-two yards in his first regular season game and committed a costly turnover. However, Benson rebounded with a 101-yard performance during his next start. After several inconsistent games, Benson began to stabilize after the bye week. In one of his best games of the season, Benson rushed for eighty-nine yards and scored one touchdown on eleven attempts. He averaged 5.8 yards in his next game, but sustained a season-ending ankle injury.[17] Benson, who had amassed 647 yards and four touchdowns, was eventually relieved by Adrian N. Peterson.[17]\n\n\nJerry Angelo, the Bears' general manager, had expressed interest in acquiring a new running back to revitalize the Bears' running game, which finished last in yards in the league.[17] Upon hearing the news, Benson commented, \"You all know the competition that goes on around here. It doesn't matter to me. Maybe somebody else can get some criticism.\"[17] On June 9, 2008, Benson was released by the Bears following his second alcohol-related arrest in five weeks.[18]\n\n\nIn October 2009, Benson confirmed that shortly before he was released by the Bears, he had been diagnosed with Celiac disease.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Benson running after taking a handoff from Carson Palmer against the New York Jets in the 2009–10 AFC wild card game. In September 2016, Benson stated that \"no year in Chicago was I happy.\".[20]\n\n\n### Cincinnati Bengals[edit]\n\n\nShortly after the grand jury failed to indict him on both incidents in Austin, Benson signed a one-year, $520,000 contract with the Cincinnati Bengals on September 30, 2008. DeDe Dorsey was placed on injured reserve and Chris Perry was the starter. Benson's season began in a loss to the Dallas Cowboys, rushing 10 times for 30 yards. He became the starting back for the Bengals in Week 7 against the Pittsburgh Steelers.[21] Benson rushed 14 times for 52 yards in his first career start as a Bengal. In the following 35–6 loss to the Houston Texans, he totaled 49 yards on 13 carries and had two receptions for 20 yards. The Bengals picked up their first victory of the season in a 21–19 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, with Benson carrying 24 times for 104 yards and a touchdown. Benson hit his stride in the Bengals' three-game winning streak at the end of the season, gashing the Washington Redskins in week 15 with 161 yards from scrimmage, including 88 yards receiving (79 of which came on a screen pass). In week 16, Benson dominated the Cleveland Browns, rushing for 171 yards. In the final game of the season against the Kansas City Chiefs, Benson had 111 yards on 25 carries. In the twelve games he was active during the 2008 season, Benson had 932 yards from scrimmage: 747 rushing and 185 receiving.\n\n\nA free agent after the 2008 season, Benson visited with the Houston Texans before signing a two-year, $7-million contract with the Bengals on March 3, 2009.\n\n\nEntering week 8 of the 2009 season, Benson had 164 carries for an NFL best 720 yards (4.4 per carry average). In week 5, he became the first 100-yard rusher against the Baltimore Ravens in 40 games, when he rushed for 120 yards and a touchdown.[22] In week 7, Benson faced his former team, the Chicago Bears, and rushed for a career-high 189 yards and a touchdown.[23]\n\n\nBenson went on to record his first 1,000-yard rushing season and he set a Bengals franchise record with six games with over 100 rushing yards. He finished the season as the NFL's 8th leading rusher with 1,251 yards, despite playing only 13 games. He then set a Bengals postseason record with 169 rushing yards in their 24–14 loss to the New York Jets.\n\n\nThe Bengals declined to resign Benson in 2012. Coach Marvin Lewis later recounted how he explained the decision to Benson: \"'Ced, it's not that I didn't think you could do that on the football field, it was the other [stuff] that I got tired of. When I would go to you and say we're going to rotate the backs [and Benson would take it poorly]. I don't need that anymore.'\"[24]\n\n\n\n### Green Bay Packers[edit]\n\n\nOn August 12, 2012, Benson signed with the Green Bay Packers.[25] The deal was reportedly a one-year contract worth $825,000.\n\n\nOn October 7, 2012, Benson suffered a Lisfranc injury to his foot and was later placed on injured reserve.\n\n\n\n## Professional baseball career[edit]\n\n\nBenson was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 12th round (370th overall) of the 2001 MLB Draft. While Benson did not play in the major leagues, he spent his time with the Dodgers playing in their summer league at Vero Beach. He also played with the Gulf Coast League Dodgers. In 25 at-bats he had 5 hits, 1 run, 3 doubles, 2 triples, and 2 RBIs.[26]\n\n\n\n## NFL career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP\n | Rushing\n | Receiving\n | Fumbles\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Att | Yds | Avg | Lng | TD | FD | Rec | Tgt | Yds | Avg | Lng | TD | FD | Fum | Lost\n |\n| 2005 | CHI | 9 | 67 | 272 | 4.1 | 36 | 0 | 12 | 1 | — | 3 | 3.0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n |\n| 2006 | CHI | 15 | 157 | 647 | 4.1 | 30 | 6 | 33 | 8 | 10 | 54 | 6.8 | 22 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2007 | CHI | 11 | 196 | 674 | 3.4 | 43 | 4 | 33 | 17 | 27 | 123 | 7.2 | 19 | 0 | 5 | 3 | 2\n |\n| 2008 | CIN | 12 | 214 | 747 | 3.5 | 46 | 2 | 36 | 20 | 26 | 185 | 9.3 | 79 | 0 | 6 | 2 | 1\n |\n| 2009 | CIN | 13 | 301 | 1,251 | 4.2 | 42 | 6 | 57 | 17 | 24 | 111 | 6.5 | 19 | 0 | 5 | 1 | 0\n |\n| 2010 | CIN | 16 | 321 | 1,111 | 3.5 | 26 | 7 | 59 | 28 | 38 | 178 | 6.4 | 24 | 1 | 9 | 7 | 5\n |\n| 2011 | CIN | 15 | 273 | 1,067 | 3.9 | 42 | 6 | 53 | 15 | 22 | 82 | 5.5 | 11 | 0 | 3 | 5 | 2\n |\n| 2012 | GB | 5 | 71 | 248 | 3.5 | 11 | 1 | 10 | 14 | 15 | 97 | 6.9 | 18 | 0 | 4 | 1 | 0\n |\n| Career[27] | 96 | 1,600 | 6,017 | 3.8 | 46 | 32 | 293 | 120 | 162 | 833 | 6.9 | 79 | 1 | 34 | 20 | 11\n |\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBenson's cousin, Aaron, played linebacker for the University of Texas from 2010 to 2013, but gave up the sport in his redshirt senior year.[28]\n\n\nBenson had celiac disease and attributed his adoption of a gluten-free diet to giving him more energy.[29]\n\n\nAfter his NFL career, Benson became a loan originator.[30]\n\n\n\n### Legal troubles[edit]\n\n\n#### 2008 arrests[edit]\n\n\nBefore the start of the 2008 season, Benson was arrested for allegedly operating a boat while intoxicated and resisting arrest.[31] On May 3, 2008, the incident occurred near Austin, Texas, by the Lower Colorado River Authority during a late night safety inspection.[31] The official police report cited that Benson had failed a field sobriety test, and became hostile towards the police.[31] The officers arrested Benson, and when he forcefully resisted arrest used pepper-spray.[32] Benson was later detained for the night, and charged with boating while intoxicated and resisting arrest.[32]\n\n\nBenson later refuted the charges against him, and stated he requested to take a follow-up field sobriety test on land after failing the initial one.[32] Benson had further accused the officers of abusing him, stating, \"I'm not handcuffed. I'm not under arrest. I'm not threatening him. I'm not pushing him. I'm not touching him. And he sprays me right in the eye.\"[32] He also asserts that officers continuously struck his ankles and feet to prevent him from walking properly.[33] A female passenger on Benson's boat also claimed to have witnessed the abuse and called her father out of fear for Benson's safety. Her fiancé, also on the boat, may have had dozens of pictures confirming Benson's account.[34]\n\n\nUpon hearing about the incident, Bears' head coach Lovie Smith stated, \"I haven't had a chance to speak with Cedric yet, but anytime we're talking about one of our players getting arrested, you're disappointed in it,\" and added \"What we're going to do from here, I'll go back and try to get as much information as I possibly can and go from there.\"[35]\n\n\nBenson was arrested for driving while intoxicated in Austin, Texas, on June 7, 2008. While returning from a restaurant with his girlfriend, police claimed that Benson drove through a red light, and failed a field sobriety test.[36] Police claimed he later refused to take a breath or blood test to determine his blood alcohol level.[36] Police detained Benson, who was released him on bond. Benson denied the police officers' allegations and insisted that he \"aced\" the field test.[37] Bears general manager Jerry Angelo commented, \"It's unfortunate. Disappointment is too much an often used word when we're talking about Cedric. The No. 1 lesson for every player is protect your job. We're all held accountable for our actions. I'm not going to say any more than that until we know for sure what the facts are.\"[38] On the following Monday, Benson was waived from the Bears. Angelo commented on the release, stating \"Cedric displayed a pattern of behavior we will not tolerate... As I said this past weekend, you have to protect your job. Everyone in this organization is held accountable for their actions.\"[39]\n\n\nBenson was later ordered by a county judge to put a built-in ignition interlock breathalyzer in his car. He was also told to start drug counseling classes.[40] Benson was cleared of all charges in September, after appearing before two grand juries in Travis County.[41]\n\n\n\n#### 2010 arrest[edit]\n\n\nOn June 29, 2010, Benson was arrested for assault with injury after reportedly punching a bartender in the face.[42] Benson himself denied committing the crime. Almost a month later the NFL announced that Benson would not be suspended.[43]\n\n\n\n#### 2011 arrest[edit]\n\n\nOn July 17, 2011, Benson was arrested in Austin, Texas, for a misdemeanor charge of assault causing bodily injury to a family member.[44] He was sentenced to 20 days in jail and ordered to pay a $4,000 fine.[45] Benson was released from jail on September 3, after only five days of his sentence.[46] He received a one-game suspension, enacted in week 8.\n\n\n\n#### 2017 arrest[edit]\n\n\nOn February 18, 2017, Benson was charged with driving while intoxicated in downtown Austin, Texas.[47] According to court documents, Benson refused to take a field sobriety test and could not recite the alphabet from G to Z nor count past the number 3. Benson was released on the same day after posting bond.\n\n\n\n## Death and legacy[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, 2019, Benson and a female passenger, Aamna Najam, were killed when his motorcycle crashed with a minivan on RM 2222 in Austin, Texas. Benson and Najam were pronounced dead at the scene, and the two occupants of the minivan were not seriously injured.[48]\n\n\nOn the two year anniversary of Benson's death, his family and the Austin Independent School District launched a mentorship program in his honor at Gus Garcia Young Men's Leadership Academy.[49]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of NCAA Division I FBS running backs with at least 50 career rushing touchdowns\n* List of NCAA major college football yearly scoring leaders\n* List of Texas Longhorns football All-Americans\n* List of Chicago Bears first-round draft picks\n* List of people diagnosed with coeliac disease\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Texas High School Football Rushing Career Yardage Leaders Lone Star Gridiron\n2. **^** George, Patrick (June 7, 2008). \"Chicago Bears running back Cedric Benson arrested on drunken driving charge\". *Austin American-Statesman*.

Williams was the interim head coach of the Auburn Tigers, the first African American to hold the position in Auburn history.[1] He played college football at Auburn where he set the school's record for career rushing touchdowns and helped the team go undefeated in 2004. During the 2005 NFL Draft, Williams was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first round and also played for the St. Louis Rams. In 2005, Williams won the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award.\n\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nWilliams attended Auburn University after graduating from Etowah High School in Attalla, Alabama. He got the nickname \"Cadillac\" from a TV sportscaster[2] in Alabama for the style and the way he ran – he was a notch above everyone on the field, and the name stuck.[3] He began the 2001 season as a true freshman and the #3 running back on the depth chart. In the eighth game of the season he had a break-out game against the University of Arkansas and showed his outstanding talent and versatility as a running back. After amassing 177 yards in a 42–17 loss to Arkansas,[4] Williams was promoted to starting running back. In the next game, the annual Deep South's Oldest Rivalry contest against the University of Georgia, he led Auburn to a 24–17 victory as he amassed 167 yards on a then Auburn record 41 carries, caught four passes for 71 yards and scored two touchdowns, one of which was the game winner.[5] (That record stood until Tre Mason had 46 carries and 304 yards against Missouri in the 2013 SEC Championship Game.[6]) Williams was injured early in the bitter in-state rivalry game against the University of Alabama (also known as the Iron Bowl) with a broken collar bone and had to sit out the rest of the season. In his freshman season, Williams played in nine games and finished with 614 yards on 120 carries (5.1 avg.) and six touchdowns.[7]\n\n\nThe 2002 season started out as a promising season for Williams. Unfortunately, it also ended prematurely for him when he broke his lower left fibula against Florida and missed the last six games of the season. He amassed 745 yards on 141 attempts (5.3 avg.) and 10 touchdowns in only seven games prior to the injury.[8]\n\n\nIn 2003, Williams was told that he would share the load at the running back position with Ronnie Brown. Brown had completed a stellar season the previous year after picking up the starting role when Williams went down with a broken ankle. However, Brown pulled a hamstring early on in the year and sat out most of the rest of the season, leaving Williams as the sole starting running back. Williams went on to have a sensational season setting an Auburn single-season record with 17 touchdowns, and gaining a career-high 1,307 yards on 241 attempts (5.4 avg.). The 2003 season was an important season for Williams because it showed that he could stay healthy and excel on the field on his own.[9] His highlight of the season was breaking an 80-yard touchdown run on the first play of scrimmage against Alabama.[10]\n\n\nIn 2004, Williams decided to return for his senior year at Auburn. This turned out to be a wise decision as he, along with quarterback Jason Campbell, Brown and others, helped lead the Tigers to an SEC Championship and Sugar Bowl winning season, finishing with a perfect 13–0 record and a controversial #2 ranking behind the University of Southern California. Williams went on to earn All-American honors and was named to the All-SEC first-team as both a running back and return specialist. He led the team in rushing for the third time with 1,165 yards on 239 carries (4.9 avg.) and scored 12 touchdowns. He finished the season with 1,718 all-purpose yards, the third highest single-season output in Auburn school history. Williams also threw one touchdown pass against Georgia. Some argue that Williams' senior year performance was not as good statistically (4.9-yard rushing average for example, the lowest in his college career) as his others because of poor blocking, while others argue that it was because defenses focused on him specifically.[11]\n\n\nWilliams finished his collegiate career with 3,831 yards on 741 attempts (5.2 yards per attempt) and 45 touchdowns, breaking the all-time Auburn career records of most rushing attempts by Joe Cribbs (657), and most touchdowns by Bo Jackson (43), while finishing second in total rushing yards in a career behind Bo Jackson. His career total of 5,033 all-purpose yards also ranks second in school history behind James Brooks.[12]\n\n\nWilliams also has the distinction of earning nine SEC Player of the Week honors in his career, the most in conference history.\n\n\nAt Auburn, Williams majored in sociology. He returned to Auburn to finish the final coursework necessary for a sociology degree in December 2014.\n\n\n\n![](image)Williams evades a tackler at Auburn.\n### Collegiate statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Team\n | GP\n | Rushing\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Att | Yds | Avg | Lng | TD | Y/G\n |\n| 2001 | Auburn | 9 | 120 | 614 | 5.1 | 55 | 6 | 68.2\n |\n| 2002 | Auburn | 7 | 141 | 745 | 5.3 | 65 | 10 | 106.4\n |\n| 2003 | Auburn | 13 | 241 | 1,307 | 5.4 | 80 | 17 | 100.5\n |\n| 2004 | Auburn | 13 | 239 | 1,165 | 4.9 | 36 | 12 | 89.6\n |\n| Career | 42 | 741 | 3,831 | 5.2 | 80 | 45 | 91.5\n |\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPre-draft measurables\n| Height | Weight | Arm length | Hand span | 40-yard dash | 10-yard split | 20-yard split | 20-yard shuttle | Three-cone drill | Vertical jump | Broad jump | Bench press |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 ft 10+7⁄8 in(1.80 m)\n | 217 lb(98 kg)\n | 30+5⁄8 in(0.78 m)\n | 8+1⁄4 in(0.21 m) | 4.43 s | 1.59 s | 2.63 s | 4.17 s | 6.95 s | 35+1⁄2 in(0.90 m) | 9 ft 10 in(3.00 m) | 19 reps |\n| All values from NFL Combine[13][14] |\n\n\n### Tampa Bay Buccaneers[edit]\n\n\nWilliams entered the 2005 NFL Draft and was selected with the fifth pick of the first round by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[15] He signed a five-year contract worth $31 million.\n\n\nJeff Reynolds of Pro Football Weekly predicted Williams was the rookie most likely to have the greatest impact in the 2005 NFL season, writing that \"at the Senior Bowl, Jon Gruden was salivating over this kid. He pulled him out real early. Don't think that was a coincidence. He's the offense. Gruden has set it up, Cadillac or bust\".\n\n\nThe first half of the season for Williams was an up and down affair. Williams rushed for 434 yards in his first three weeks, setting records as the first rookie running back to ever have three consecutive 100 yard games, and rushing for the most yards in the first three weeks of a career, a record previously held by Alan Ameche of the 1955 Baltimore Colts. Williams was also named rookie of the week for the first three weeks of the season and rookie of the month for September. His shoes and gloves from week three were subsequently retired to the Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.[16] In week four however, Williams dealt with injuries to his ankle and arch in his right foot, causing him to miss two weeks. In the next four games he played, including the game in which he was injured, Williams only rushed for a combined 82 yards on limited carries. However, in his next four games, he averaged over 100 yards per game (408). In his rookie season, Williams tallied six 100-yard games in 14 starts, and led all rookies in total rushing yards (1,178), rookie of the week honors (3), and finished second, behind Brandon Jacobs for rushing touchdowns (6).\n\n\nOn January 4, 2006, Williams was awarded the Associated Press NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award. He drew 47 votes of a nationwide panel of 50 sports writers and broadcasters who cover the NFL. He beat former running mate Ronnie Brown of Miami, who received one vote. Tight end Heath Miller of Pittsburgh and offensive lineman Logan Mankins of New England also received one vote. On February 2, 2006, Williams was announced as the NFL Rookie of the Year Award winner based on the votes of over 1,000,000 visitors to NFL.com.\n\n\nWilliams was unable to match the success of his rookie campaign in the 2006 NFL season, as he failed to reach the 1,000 yard mark. His reduced production was attributed to poor offensive line play and an injury that nagged him all year.\n\n\n\n#### Injuries[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2007, Williams suffered a torn patellar tendon to his right knee against Carolina, which required surgery and ended his season. Doctors were doubtful he would come back to full strength after this devastating injury. Williams, however, said that he had \"no doubt\" that he would play in 2008.\n\n\nIn mid-season of 2008, Williams began practicing with the team and was listed as questionable on the official injury report. In November, he was taken off the Physically Unable to Perform list and added to the active roster. He played in his first game in 14 months against Detroit. On November 30 against the Saints, he scored his first touchdown since his return. One month later, however, during the final game of the season on December 28, Williams suffered another torn patellar tendon, this time in his left knee.\n\n\nThe second tear was not as severe as the first, but Williams again endured surgery and an intense period of rehab to get back on the field. He returned to game action during the 2009 preseason and was the Bucs' starting running back to open the regular season, becoming the first NFL player to return from patellar tendon tears in both knees.[17] On December 27, Williams had his first 100-yard rushing game in two seasons for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and finished with 823 yards, the second highest total of his NFL career.. Williams was narrowly edged for the AP 2009 Comeback Player of the Year Award by Tom Brady, finishing second with 15 votes. He rushed for 821 yards on 210 carries with a 3.9 average and four touchdowns. He also caught 29 passes for 219 yards and 3 touchdowns.\n\n\nAfter Williams' turnaround 2009 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season, in which he played in all 16 games for the first time in his career, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had high hopes for their former National Football League Rookie of the Year Award winner. However, due to the emergence of undrafted rookie sensation LeGarrette Blount, Williams found himself cemented as primarily the third down running back for the latter half of the 2010 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season. Williams was used as a passing threat on third down and finished the season with 46 receptions for 355 yards and one touchdown (a come-from-behind, game-winning catch from Josh Freeman with ten seconds left in the fourth quarter on October 24, 2010, against the St. Louis Rams). He finished the 2010 NFL season with 125 rushing attempts for 437 yards and two touchdowns (one against the San Francisco 49ers and one against the Carolina Panthers), helping his team to a 10–6 record. The Buccaneers missed the 2010-11 NFL playoffs and Williams became an unrestricted free agent in 2011.\n\n\n\n### St. Louis Rams[edit]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2011, Williams signed with the St. Louis Rams to be the backup for Steven Jackson. In the 2011 regular season opener, Williams had 91 yards on 19 carries against the Philadelphia Eagles. Williams rushed effectively throughout the season for St. Louis, mainly in a backup capacity. He finished the year with 361 rushing yards and 4.1 yards per carry. He also scored one rushing touchdown, in the final game of the season against the San Francisco 49ers.[18]\n\n\n\n## NFL career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP\n | Rushing\n | Receiving\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Att | Yds | Avg | Lng | TD | Y/G | Rec | Yds | Avg | Lng | TD | Y/G\n |\n| 2005 | TB | 14 | 290 | 1,178 | 4.1 | 71 | 6 | 84.1 | 20 | 81 | 4.1 | 15 | 0 | 6.2\n |\n| 2006 | TB | 14 | 225 | 798 | 3.5 | 38 | 1 | 57.0 | 30 | 196 | 6.5 | 21 | 0 | 14.0\n |\n| 2007 | TB | 4 | 54 | 208 | 3.9 | 38 | 3 | 52.0 | 3 | 17 | 5.6 | 6 | 0 | 4.3\n |\n| 2008 | TB | 6 | 63 | 233 | 3.7 | 28 | 4 | 38.8 | 7 | 43 | 6.1 | 25 | 0 | 7.2\n |\n| 2009 | TB | 16 | 211 | 832 | 3.9 | 35 | 4 | 51.3 | 28 | 217 | 7.8 | 22 | 3 | 13.5\n |\n| 2010 | TB | 16 | 125 | 437 | 3.5 | 45 | 2 | 27.3 | 46 | 355 | 7.7 | 20 | 1 | 22.2\n |\n| 2011 | STL | 11 | 87 | 361 | 4.1 | 23 | 1 | 30.1 | 14 | 93 | 6.6 | 16 | 0 | 7.8\n |\n| Total | 81 | 1,055 | 4,047 | 3.8 | 71 | 21 | 50.0 | 148 | 1,002 | 6.8 | 25 | 4 | 12.4\n |\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\nWilliams served as an offensive graduate assistant at the University of West Georgia in Carrollton, Georgia for the 2016 season.[19] Williams later served as the running backs coach for the newly created IMG White football team at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida.[20]\n\n\nIn 2018, Williams became the running backs coach for the Birmingham Iron of the Alliance of American Football.[21] On January 23, 2019, he was hired as Auburn's running backs coach under head coach Gus Malzahn.[22] Williams acknowledges and expresses gratitude for Malzahn's early mentoring in his career.[23]\nAuburn fired Malzahn after the 2020 season; new head coach Bryan Harsin retained Williams as running backs coach.[24] On October 31, 2022, Auburn fired Harsin and named Williams the interim head coach.[25] On November 12, 2022, Williams won his first game as a head coach, a 13–10 victory over Texas A&M.[26] Williams, who finished the 2022 regular season at 2–2 as interim head coach, was retained as an assistant by Hugh Freeze when Freeze was named the permanent head coach on November 28.[27]\n\n\n\n## Head coaching record[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | Overall\n | Conference | Standing\n | Bowl/playoffs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Auburn Tigers** *(Southeastern Conference)* (2022) |\n| 2022 | Auburn | 2–2[a] | 1–2 | T–6th  (Western) |  |\n| **Auburn:** | 2–2 | 1–2 |  |\n| **Total:** | 2–2 |  |\n\n\n1. **^** Williams replaced Bryan Harsin after eight games.\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nWilliams is a Christian.[28] He is married and has two sons.[29]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Cole, Adam (October 31, 2022). \"Carnell Williams named Auburn's interim head coach\". *OANow.com*.

A member of the San Francisco 49ers during most of his career, he ranks third in NFL career rushing yards. His career was also noted for longevity, a rare trait with his position, and he holds the league record for games played by a running back.[1]\n\n\nGore played college football at the University of Miami and was selected by the 49ers in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft. During his 10 seasons with the 49ers, he became the franchise's rushing yards leader and received five Pro Bowl selections. He also led the National Football Conference (NFC) in rushing yards during the 2006 season and made an appearance in Super Bowl XLVII. After leaving San Francisco at the end of the 2014 season, Gore played for the Indianapolis Colts, Miami Dolphins, Buffalo Bills, and New York Jets. He is a member of the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nGore was born on May 14, 1983, in Miami, Florida, and grew up in Coconut Grove. He attended Coral Gables Senior High School in Coral Gables, Florida, where he played running back on the football team.[3] He had two notable record-breaking games. Against Miami Northwestern High School, he had a then-career high 293 yards and two touchdowns on 10 carries. In the next game, he broke that record with 319 yards and six touchdowns on 13 carries against the third-ranked defense in the nation. During his senior year in 2000, Gore broke several Dade County single-season records, including rushing yards (2,997) and touchdowns (39).[4][5] Heavily recruited, he was named the fourth-ranked prospect in the state of Florida and 18th nationally.[6]\n\n\nWhile emerging as a talented football prospect, Gore also focused his attention on improving his academics and assisting his mother, who was battling kidney disease and had started dialysis treatments.[7] To remain close to home, Gore chose to attend the University of Miami.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nGore had a scholarship to attend the University of Miami under head coach Larry Coker.[10][11]\n\n\n\n### 2001 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2001 Miami Hurricanes football team\n\nIn his freshman year, Gore shared the backfield with Clinton Portis and Willis McGahee, with Portis receiving a majority of the carries.[12] Gore made his collegiate debut against the Penn State Nittany Lions on September 1. He had six carries for 15 yards in the 33–7 victory over the Nittany Lions.[13] In the next game against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, he had six carries for 78 yards and his first collegiate rushing touchdown in the 61–0 victory.[14] On October 25, Gore had a breakout game against the West Virginia Mountaineers with six carries for 124 yards and two touchdowns in the 45–3 victory.[15] On November 17, he churned 11 carries for 157 rushing yards against Syracuse.[16]\n\n\nAs a true freshman for the Miami Hurricanes football in 2001, Gore totaled 562 yards with five touchdowns on 62 carries, for a 9.1-yard avg, as a backup to Clinton Portis on Miami's 2001 National championship winning team.[17][18] Gore has the third-best season total in school history by a freshman and was named *Sporting News'* Big East Freshman of the Year.[19]\n\n\n\n### 2002 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2002 Miami Hurricanes football team\n\nGore suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee during spring practice in 2002 and spent the following season recovering from knee surgery.[20] Before his injury that year, Gore beat out future NFL running back Willis McGahee in the spring of 2002 for the role as the Hurricanes' starter.[21]\n\n\n\n### 2003 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2003 Miami Hurricanes football team\n\nGore returned from his injury in the 2003 season. He shared the backfield with Jarrett Payton and Tyrone Moss.[22] Gore started the season strong with three games going over 100 rushing yards and scoring three touchdowns in that span. However, on October 2, Gore played in his final game of the 2003 season against the West Virginia Mountaineers and had four carries for 15 yards before tearing his ACL again, which ended his season.[23][24][25]\n\n\nGore finished the 2003 season with 89 carries for 468 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns to go along with 12 receptions for 105 receiving yards.[26]\n\n\n\n### 2004 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2004 Miami Hurricanes football team\n\nGore returned from his ACL injury to lead the Miami backfield in carries, rushing yards, and rushing touchdowns.[27][28][29] In the regular season opener against Florida State, he recorded the game-winning 18-yard touchdown run in overtime.[30] He recorded three games with over 100 rushing yards, including a 195-yard performance against Virginia on October 13. He finished the season with 197 carries for 945 rushing yards and eight rushing touchdowns.[31]\n\n\nIn 28 total games with the Hurricanes, Gore rushed 380 times for 1,975 yards (a 5.7 rushing average) and seventeen touchdowns.[32] When his college career was finished, Gore's 1,975 yards ranked seventh on the school's career-record list and his seventeen touchdowns were tied for tenth. He also caught 25 passes for 225 yards (9.8 avg), returned two kickoffs for 48 yards and recorded five tackles on special teams.[33]\n\n\n\n### Collegiate statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Frank Gore\n | Rushing\n | Receiving\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Season | Team | GP | Att | Yds | Avg | TD | Rec | Yds | Avg | TD\n |\n| 2001 | Miami (FL) | 11 | 62 | 562 | 9.1 | 5 | 1 | 14 | 14.0 | 0\n |\n| 2003 | Miami (FL) | 5 | 89 | 468 | 5.3 | 4 | 12 | 105 | 8.8 | 0\n |\n| 2004 | Miami (FL) | 12 | 197 | 945 | 4.8 | 8 | 10 | 106 | 10.6 | 0\n |\n| Career | 28 | 348 | 1,975 | 5.7 | 17 | 23 | 225 | 9.8 | 0\n |\n\n\nGore was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPre-draft measurables\n| Height | Weight | 40-yard dash | 20-yard shuttle | Three-cone drill | Vertical jump | Broad jump | Bench press | Wonderlic |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 ft 9+3⁄8 in(1.76 m)\n | 210 lb(95 kg)\n | 4.58 s | 4.11 s | 6.91 s | 34 in(0.86 m) | 9 ft 1 in(2.77 m) | 17 reps | 6 |\n| All values from NFL Combine[34][35][36] |\n\n\n### San Francisco 49ers[edit]\n\n\nGore was selected in the third round with the 65th overall pick of the 2005 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers. He was the sixth running back to be selected in the 2005 NFL Draft. In addition, he was the third of five Miami Hurricanes to be selected that year.[37]\n\n\n\n#### 2005 season: Rookie year[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2005 San Francisco 49ers season\n\nGore signed a three-year contract with the team on July 28, 2005. He played in 14 games, starting one, in the 2005 season. Gore was inactive for two contests with a groin injury. He finished the season seventh among all NFL rookie running backs in rushing average with 4.8 average per run. He led the team in rushing with 608 yards on 127 carries and three rushing touchdowns.[38][39] Gore also caught 15 passes for 131 yards. His season was the first time a rookie led the 49ers in rushing since 1990, when Dexter Carter paced the team with 460 yards.[40] Gore's 608 rushing yards was the highest for a 49ers rookie since Roger Craig had 725 yards rushing in 1983.[41]\n\n\nGore rushed for 17 yards on four carries and caught two passes for 21 yards in his NFL debut, a 28–25 victory over the St. Louis Rams.[42] Two weeks later, he rushed for 42 yards on seven carries with a 5.4-yard average in a 34–31 loss against the Dallas Cowboys.[43] Gore led the team with 89 yards on nine carries and recorded a then career-long 72-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter of a 52–17 road loss to the Washington Redskins.[44] The touchdown was the longest run from scrimmage by a 49ers player since running back Kevan Barlow had a 78-yard rush against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2003.[45] The touchdown run was fifth-longest run from scrimmage by a 49ers rookie. Gore led the team in rushing for the third straight week with 55 yards on 14 carries (3.9-yard avg.) at the Chicago Bears, with a 19-yard long.[46] He made his first NFL start in a 10–9 road loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, amassing over 100 combined yards with 79 yards rushing on 19 attempts for a 4.2 yard average with three receptions for 57 yards.[47] Gore had his first two-touchdown game in a 24–20 victory over the Rams, with a 10-yard scoring run in the second quarter and a 30-yard score in the fourth quarter.[48] In the regular-season finale against the Houston Texans, he registered his first 100-yard game with 108 yards on 25 carries as the 49ers won by a score of 20–17.[49] Following the season, he had major surgery on both shoulders.[50]\n\n\n\n#### 2006 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2006 San Francisco 49ers season\n\nGore was elevated to the top of the 49ers' depth chart following the August 19, 2006, trade that shipped incumbent starter Kevan Barlow to the New York Jets in exchange for a fourth-round draft pick.[51][52]\n\n\nGore emerged as one of the top running backs in the NFL in his first full season as the starter. He carried the ball 312 times for a franchise-record 1,695 yards, eclipsing Garrison Hearst's 1998 record of 1,570 yards.[53] Gore became the first player in franchise history to lead the NFC in rushing yards. He also set a franchise record with 2,180 combined yards (1,695 yards rushing and 485 yards receiving), breaking Hearst's single-season record of 2,105 total yards (1,570 rushing and 535 receiving) set in 1998. Gore's total placed him second in the NFC to Steven Jackson (1,528 rushing and 806 receiving, 2,334 total) and fourth overall in the entire NFL. In the 49ers' first meeting against the Seattle Seahawks, Gore set the 49ers' single-game rushing record by totaling a career-high 212 yards on 24 carries, besting the 201 yards by Charlie Garner on September 24, 2000, against the Dallas Cowboys.[54][55] Gore had nine 100-yard rushing games in 2006, giving him ten for his career. His nine 100-yard games in 2006 shattered the franchise record for most 100-yard games in a season. Garrison Hearst (1998) and Roger Craig (1988) each had six 100-yard games in a season. Gore was the first 49ers running back to have three-straight 100 yard games since Garrison Hearst had a 49ers-record four straight 100-yard games during Weeks 13–16 of the 1998 season. In those three weeks, Gore set the team record for most rushing yards in a three-game span.[56][57][58]\n\n\nGore's breakaway ability helped him finish the season with 5.4 yards per carry, placing him third in the entire NFL, behind only Michael Vick (8.4 YPC on 123 carries) and Maurice Jones-Drew (5.7 YPC on 166 carries). The 5.4 yards per carry are tied for the second-best in 49ers history. Among players with over 300 carries, however, Gore's season puts him in elite company. Very few times has a player averaged as many yards per carry as Gore did while carrying the ball over 300 times. The players ahead of him contain Hall of Famers and feature five 2,000-yard rushing seasons.[59]\n\n\nGore finished the season with eight rushing touchdowns, tied for the third-most in a season by a 49er.[60] He finished the season with a team-leading 61 receptions.[61] Only two other teams had a running back as their leading receiver: New Orleans (Reggie Bush) and Philadelphia (Brian Westbrook). Of those, only Gore and Westbrook also led their team in rushing. Gore also caught his first receiving touchdown of his career on the road against the Seahawks when quarterback Alex Smith avoided a sack and found Gore along the left sideline for a 20-yard score. Gore led the NFL with 16 rushes for 20 or more yards. Gore earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors twice during the 2006 season.

The nickname was inspired by the movie *An Inconvenient Truth* written by former United States Vice President Al Gore, which was released in May of the same year.[65]\n\n\nGore had benefited that season from the tutelage of then-offensive coordinator Norv Turner, whose offensive scheme places a heavy emphasis on running the football.[66]\n\n\nThough Gore had fumbling problems at the beginning of the season, losing the ball once in each of the first four games, he improved his carrying and only fumbled three more times the rest of the year.[53]\n\n\n\n#### 2007 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2007 San Francisco 49ers season\n\n![](image)Gore in action against the St. Louis Rams in 2007\nGore signed a contract extension through 2011 estimated to be worth $28 million over four years on March 28, 2007.

He was also complemented by a new second-string back, 49ers' third-round draft pick Glen Coffee.[81]\n\n\nAfter being nearly shut down in the season-opener against the Arizona Cardinals, Gore had a career day the following week in the home opener against the Seattle Seahawks.[82] Gore rushed for 206 yards for a 12.8-yard average, including a 79-yard and an 80-yard touchdown run in the 23–10 victory, becoming the second player in NFL history to rush for two touchdowns for 75 yards or more in a single game, with the other being Hall-of-Fame running back Barry Sanders.[83][84] He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for the fourth time in his career.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gore on the sidelines with the San Francisco 49ers, 2009\nAfter missing two games against the St. Louis Rams and Atlanta Falcons due to an ankle injury, Gore returned in Week 7 against the Houston Texans.[86] While he had a successful game against the Chicago Bears in Week 10, gaining 104 yards with a touchdown,[87] he was used less in the 49ers' offensive game plan in the following three weeks, after the team adopted more of a spread offense.[88] In the 49ers' second divisional game against the Cardinals in Week 14, Gore had one of his most successful games of the season, rushing for 167 yards on 25 carries and a touchdown.[89] He earned his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week award for the 2009 season.[90] Against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 16, Gore had 16 carries for 107 yards against an Eagles team that had not given up a 100-yard game in 22 consecutive games.[91] Gore was named a first alternate for the 2009 Pro Bowl.[53] On January 20, 2010, Steven Jackson announced he would not be playing in the Pro Bowl because of injury, so Gore was named to the 2010 Pro Bowl in his spot, the second of his career.[92] For the season, Gore amassed 10 rushing touchdowns and 13 total touchdowns from scrimmage, both career bests.[93]\n\n\n\n#### 2010 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2010 San Francisco 49ers season\n\nAfter a slow start to the season with 17 carries for 38 yards against the Seattle Seahawks, Gore had 168 scrimmage yards (112 rushing, 56 receiving) against the New Orleans Saints in Week 2.[94][95] During Week 3 against the Kansas City Chiefs, he had nine receptions for 102 yards, his only career game with over 100 receiving yards.[96] Gore had rushed for four 100-yard games before fracturing his right hip in a Week 12 win over the Arizona Cardinals, prematurely ending his season[97] after the 49ers put him on IR.[98]\n\n\nGore finished the 2010 season with 203 carries for 853 yards and three touchdowns to go along with 46 receptions for 452 yards and two touchdowns.[99] He was ranked 94th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.[100]\n\n\n\n#### 2011 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2011 San Francisco 49ers season\n\nGore agreed to a three-year extension, worth $25.9 million, on August 30, 2011. The extension kept Gore with the San Francisco 49ers through the 2014 season.[101]\n\n\nDuring the offseason, the 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh to be their new head coach and built themselves around a combination of a great running game, a supplemental passing game and a power house defense.[102] This combination proved to be effective for Gore and the 49ers, leading them to a 13–3 record in the regular season and a playoff spot for the 49ers, their first such appearance since 2002 along with a first round bye.[103][104]\n\n\nIn the first three games of the season, Gore did not perform well, rushing for 148 yards on 59 carries for only one touchdown.[105] During Week 4 against the Philadelphia Eagles, the 49ers were down 23–3 at the end of the first half, but quarterback Alex Smith and Gore both led drives to narrowly win 24–23. Gore rushed for 127 yards on 15 carries and rushed for the game-winning touchdown when four minutes were left in the game.[106] In the next game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Gore rushed for 125 yards and a touchdown in the 48–3 win for the 49ers.[107] However, his performance in that game was eclipsed by his performance the following week against the Detroit Lions, where he rushed a season-high of 141 yards on 15 carries and a touchdown in a 25–19 road victory, defeating the previously unbeaten Lions.[108]\n\n\nThe next few games went pretty well for Gore, rushing for 134 yards and a touchdown against the Cleveland Browns and 107 yards against the Washington Redskins, becoming the 49ers' record holder of most consecutive games with 100 yards with five.[109][110] However, against the New York Giants, Gore had an unmemorable performance, rushing for no yards and leaving in the second half with a knee injury.[111] This was his first game with no rushing yards.[112] Gore returned the next game, where he redeemed himself against the Arizona Cardinals, rushing for 88 yards and a touchdown.[113] However, he rushed for only 39 yards in the next game against the Baltimore Ravens as the 49ers lost by a score of 6–16.[114] The following week, however, proved to be a 49ers win against the St. Louis Rams, where Gore became the 49ers' all-time leading yardage rusher, surpassing Joe Perry's mark of 8,689 yards; he rushed for 73 yards on the game.[115] The next week, Gore performed well, rushing for 72 yards and the 49ers' only touchdown in the narrow 21–19 loss.[116]\n\n\nGore managed to finish the season on a high note, with a three-game winning streak, including one against the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he rushed for 65 yards and a touchdown.[117] Gore finished the season with 1,211 yards, having had five seasons with at least 1,000 rushing yards.[118]\n\n\nDuring the playoffs, Gore performed exceedingly well, helping the 49ers set up a touchdown by rushing for 42 yards in the divisional round in his playoff debut, a 36–32 victory over the New Orleans Saints; Gore had a total of 89 yards in the game.[119] During the NFC Championship Game, he rushed for 74 yards in the 20–17 overtime loss to the Giants.[120] Gore was ranked 28th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.[121]\n\n\n\n#### 2012 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gore in Green Bay for the 2012 season opener\nSee also: 2012 San Francisco 49ers season\n\nIn the 2012 regular season, Gore started all 16 games and had three games going over the 100-yard mark.[122] In the regular-season finale against the Arizona Cardinals at Candlestick Park, Gore became the all-time franchise leader in rushing touchdowns (51) as the 49ers won the NFC West.[123]\n\n\nGore finished the 2012 season with 258 carries for 1,214 yards and eight touchdowns to go along with 28 receptions for 234 yards and a touchdown.[124] He was also selected to play in the Pro Bowl, his fourth appearance.[125]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, the 49ers faced the Green Bay Packers once again, this time in the divisional round.

career[edit]\n\n\nAfter his football career, Gore devoted himself to boxing,[224] in the heavyweight category, first playing an exhibition match in 2021 against former NBA player Deron Williams[225] and then making his professional debut on May 14, 2022, winning the match against Olaseyinde Olorunsola by knockout.[226]\n\n\n\n### 49ers advisory[edit]\n\n\nOn July 29, 2023, the 49ers hired Gore to join their office as a football advisor for the club. [227]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGore (Sr.)'s eldest son, Frank Gore (Jr.), was born in 2002 while Gore Sr. was in college at the University of Miami. Gore Jr. followed in his father's footsteps and plays running back. Gore Sr. did not plan for his son to end up playing football, remarking: \n\n\n> \"Whatever he wants to do, he's going to do it; not because I played ball, he has to play ball. Me seeing him when he was a little kid playing outside with his bigger cousins, I knew he was going to play football, but if he doesn't want to play, as long as he gets his grades and does something positive with his life, I'm okay with it.\"\n> \n> \n\n Due to his NFL career, Frank Gore Sr. was unable to see his son play in local football games past the age of 5 until his return to Miami 13 years later when he signed with the Miami Dolphins. On December 19, 2019, Gore Jr., a three-star prospect, committed to play football at University of Southern Mississippi after also receiving offers from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and Florida Atlantic University.[228]\n\n\n### Charitable work[edit]\n\n\nOn April 12, 2018, Gore was honored by Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and given the 'Keys to the City'. As per Mayor Suarez, Gore \"symbolizes the very soul of [Miami], is a product of our city, a product of the West Grove, where so many families for so many generations have grown up together.\" While receiving applause, Gore asked for his family and friends in attendance at the event to stand to be honored as well. In Gore's view, it was equally important to thank and honor those who had been with him throughout all the hardships he had faced in his life, including \"growing up in a one-bedroom apartment with twelve people as a kid\". Mayor Suarez proclaimed April 12 as \"Frank Gore Day\".[229][230]\n\n\n\n## Boxing record[edit]\n\n\n### Professional record[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2 fights\n | 2 wins\n | 0 losses\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| By knockout\n | 2\n | 0\n |\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Result\n | Record\n | Opponent\n | Type\n | Round, time\n | Date\n | Location\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2\n | Win\n | 2–0\n | Joshua Romero\n | TKO\n | 1 (4)\n | December 3, 2022\n | San Antonio, Texas\n |  |\n| 1\n | Win\n | 1–0\n | Olaseyinde Olorunsola\n | KO | 4 (4)\n | May 14, 2022\n | Biloxi, Mississippi\n | [231] |\n\n\n### Exhibition record[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 1 fight\n | 0 wins\n | 1 loss\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| By decision\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Result\n | Record\n | Opponent\n | Type\n | Round, time\n | Date\n | Location\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Loss\n | 0–1\n | Deron Williams | SD | 4\n | Dec 18, 2021 | Amalie Arena, Tampa, Florida, U.S. | [232] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Football League career rushing yards leaders\n* List of National Football League career rushing touchdowns leaders\n* List of National Football League career all-purpose yards leaders\n* List of National Football League career rushing attempts leaders\n* List of NFL players by games played\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Neumann, Sam (December 20, 2020). \"Frank Gore sets record for career games by a running back\". *Jets Wire*.
