The successor to macOS Big Sur, it was announced at WWDC 2021 on June 7, 2021,[3][4][5][6] and released on October 25, 2021.[7][8] macOS Monterey was succeeded by macOS Ventura, which was released on October 24, 2022.\n\n\nThe operating system is named after Monterey Bay, continuing the trend of releases named after California locations since 2013's 10.9 Mavericks.\n\n\nmacOS Monterey is the final version of macOS that supports the 2015\u20132017 MacBook Air, Retina MacBook Pro, 2014 Mac Mini and cylindrical Mac Pro, as its successor, macOS Ventura, drops support for those models.\n\n\n\n\n## Changes[edit]\n\n\nMonterey introduced several new features and changes, including the following:[3]\n\n\n\n* Shortcuts for the Mac\n* TestFlight for the Mac\n* Provisions to allow the planned introduction of Universal Control,[9] which allows a single keyboard and mouse to control multiple Macs and iPads.

It works on these iPads: iPad Pro, iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (6th generation and later), and iPad Mini (5th generation and later).\n* Support for the Apple Music Voice Plan Subscription.\n* Portrait Mode and Noise Cancellation features for FaceTime and some apps (in Control Center).\n* New Toolbar features and designs for Finder and the Preview app.\n* Have a Live Memoji and Animoji right on the lock screen.\n* A yellow privacy indicator on the menu bar for indicating if the Mac's microphone or camera is active.\n* Live Text, which allows a user to copy, paste, translate and look up text from images displayed by Photos, Screenshot, Quick Look, and Safari.\n* New Passwords Manager for Mac\n* New on-device machine-learning\u2013activated keyboard dictation using Siri, and also now for almost unlimited duration.\n* Low Power Mode for Mac that enables longer battery life for lightweight workflows such as reading PDFs, Web browsing, listening to music, etc. This works on MacBook Air (2018 and later) and MacBook Pro (2016 and later).[10]\n* A redesigned optional compact interface for the Safari browser.\n* Support for playing AirPlay content streamed from recent iOS and iPadOS devices and Macs, including MacBook Pro (2018 and later), MacBook Air (2018 and later), iMac (2019 and later), iMac Pro (2017), Mac Mini (M1, 2020 and later), Mac Pro (2019), iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro (2nd generation and later), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (6th generation and later), and iPad Mini (5th generation and later). Older iPhone, iPad, and Mac models may share content at a lower resolution to supported Mac models when \"Allow AirPlay for\" is set to \"Everyone\" or \"Anyone on the same network\" in Sharing preferences.\n* Improvements to FaceTime, including the ability to share a screen and the SharePlay function that enables multiple users to watch or listen simultaneously and in sync (e.g., to music or TV shows).\n* The ability to factory reset the Mac from the System Preferences app.[11]\n* Visual Look Up makes it easy to identify objects (e.g. cat breeds, dog breeds, etc.) found within user's photos.\n* Focus to set different modes to filter notifications across iPhones, iPads and Macs.\n* The Time Machine backup functionality excludes more system files.[12]\n* Provisions to allow the planned introduction of \"Expanded Protections for Children,\" which will apply cryptography to detect and help limit the spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online by scanning the user's iCloud photos.[13]\n* Accessibility option to change the mouse pointer's colors.\n* Tips notifications.\n* The removal of a previously bundled PHP interpreter.[14]\n* The removal of a previously bundled Python 2.7 interpreter (from 12.3)[15][16]\n* The removal of the ability to use custom Quartz Composer filters and plugins in Photo Booth.\n* networkQuality, a command-line tool for measuring upload/download capacity, upload/download flows, and upload/download responsiveness\n* An automatically populated \"Games\" folder within launchpad\n* Support for ProMotion in new 2021 MacBook Pro\n* New Object Capture API for creating 3D models using images[17]\n\n\n### Applications[edit]\n\n\n#### Notes[edit]\n\n\nIn the Notes application, users can now apply arbitrary tags to a note (e.g., #cooking, #work); groups of notes with a given tag or tags can be viewed in Smart Folders or a Tag Browser in the sidebar.[18] The new Quick Notes function enables a user to create a note from within any app via system-wide keyboard shortcut or hot corner.[19]\n\n\n\n#### Maps[edit]\n\n\nApple Maps adds a 3D globe, with increased mountain, desert, and forest detail.[20]\n\n\n\n#### Messages[edit]\n\n\nMessages supports new features, also introduced in iOS 15, such as \"Shared with You\" which provides shortcut links to content shared via Messages in other Apple apps such as Safari, Photos, Music, and News.\n\n\nWhen multiple photos are sent/received, they are now displayed as a collection instead of multiple messages. A download button is provided to download all photos simultaneously.[21]\n\n\n\n## Known problems[edit]\n\n\nUsers and developers have reported the following:\n\n\n\n* Laptops unable to boot (fixed with 12.0.1 update)[22][23]\n* Inability to charge sleeping laptops with MagSafe (fixed with 12.1 update)[24]\n* Mouse pointer memory leak issue (fixed with 12.1 update)[25]\n* Audio issue with speaker and audio output crackling and popping[26]\n* Problems connecting external displays to Mac using any version of Monterey[27]\n* Unicode Hex Input does not work if the code point number is 0xx0 (first and last digits are zero)[28] (fixed in Ventura 13.3)\n\n\n## Supported hardware[edit]\n\n\nSee Apple's official list on their website\n\nmacOS Monterey drops support for various Macs released from 2013 to 2015,[29][30] including all Macs with Nvidia GPUs.

It was announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 22, 2020,[4] and was released to the public on November 12, 2020.[5][4][6]\n\n\nBig Sur is the successor to macOS Catalina, and was succeeded by macOS Monterey, which was released on October 25, 2021. The release of Big Sur was the first time the major version number of the operating system had been incremented since the Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000.\n\n\nFor the first time since OS X Yosemite 6 years earlier, macOS Big Sur features a user interface redesign. It features new blurs to establish a visual hierarchy, along with making icons more square and UI elements more consistent. Other changes include a revamp of the Time Machine backup mechanism, the control center from iOS 7, among other things. It is also the first macOS version to support Macs with ARM-based processors. To mark the transition, the operating system's major version number was incremented, for the first time since 2001, from 10 to 11.[7][8] The operating system is named after the coastal region of Big Sur in the Central Coast of California, continuing the naming trend of California locations that began with OS X Mavericks.\n\n\nmacOS Big Sur is the final version of macOS that supports Macs with Nvidia graphics cards, specifically the 15-inch dual graphics late 2013 and mid 2014 MacBook Pro models, as its successor, macOS Monterey, drops support for those models.\n\n\n\n\n## Development history[edit]\n\n\nProviding some indication as to how the pre-release operating system may have been viewed internally at Apple during its development cycle, documentation accompanying the initial beta release of macOS Big Sur referred to its version as \"10.16\", and when upgrading from prior versions of macOS using the Software Update mechanism to early beta releases, the version referred to was \"10.16\".[9] An exception to this was the Developer Transition Kit, which always reported the system version as \"11.0\".[9] macOS Big Sur started reporting the system version as \"11.0\" on all Macs as of the third beta release.\n\n\nTo maintain backwards compatibility, macOS Big Sur identified itself as 10.16 to software and in the browser user agent.[10]\n\n\n\n## System requirements[edit]\n\n\nUnlike macOS Catalina, which supported every standard configuration Mac that Mojave supported, Big Sur drops support for various Macs released in 2012 and early 2013. Big Sur runs on the following Macs:[11]\n\n\n\n* iMac (Mid 2014 or later)\n* iMac Pro (2017)\n* MacBook (Early 2015 or later)\n* MacBook Air (Mid 2013 or later)\n* MacBook Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n* Mac Mini (Late 2014 or later)\n* Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n* Developer Transition Kit (only up to Big Sur 11.3 beta 2[12])\n\n\nBy using patch tools, macOS Big Sur can be installed on earlier computers that are officially unsupported, such as the 2012 iMac and the 2012 MacBook Pro.[13] Using these methods, it is possible to install macOS Big Sur on computers as old as a 2008 MacBook Pro and iMac and 2009 Mac Mini.[14]\n\n\n\n## Changes[edit]\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\nMacOS Big Sur refreshes the design of the user interface, described by Apple as the biggest change since the introduction of Mac OS X.[5] Its changes include translucency in various places, a new abstract wallpaper for the first time and a new color palette. All standard apps, as well as the Dock and the Menu Bar, are redesigned and streamlined, and their icons now have square shapes like iOS and iPadOS apps, and are distinctly more round.[15] Compared to iOS, Big Sur's icons include more shading and highlights to give a three-dimensional appearance. Its aesthetic has been described as \"neumorphism\", a portmanteau of new and skeuomorphism.[16][17] System sounds are redone as well.\n\n\nThe new OS also brings further integration with Apple's SF Symbols, enabling easier use by third-party developers as UI elements for their applications through AppKit, SwiftUI, and Catalyst, which makes it possible to unify third party applications with the existing Apple-made design language.[18]\n\n\n\n### Interface[edit]\n\n\n#### Control Center[edit]\n\n\nAn interface with quick toggles for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, screen brightness and system volume has been added to the menu bar.[15] This interface is functionally and visually similar to the Control Center on iOS and iPadOS.\n\n\n\n#### Notification Center[edit]\n\n\nThe Notification Center is redesigned, featuring interactive notifications and a transparent user interface. Notification Center also features a new widget system similar to that in iOS 14, displaying more information with more customization than previously available.[5]\n\n\n\n### System[edit]\n\n\n#### Support for Apple silicon[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Big Sur is the first release of macOS for Macs powered by Apple-designed ARM64-based processors, a key part of the transition from Intel x86-64-based processors.[19] The chip mentioned in demo videos, and used in the Developer Transition Kit, is the A12Z Bionic. On November 10, 2020, Apple announced the first Mac Apple silicon chip, the Apple M1, in the Late 2020 Mac Mini, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro.[20] Apple has said that it will support Intel Macs \"for years to come\",[19][21] and most software that has not been ported to run on ARM Macs can use Rosetta 2, an update of a compatibility mechanism originally developed for the PowerPC-to-Intel x86 transition. Likewise, Apple also introduced an updated universal binary format, Universal 2, which allows developers to package their applications so that they can run natively on both ARM64 and x86-64 processors.[22]\n\n\n\n#### Support for iOS and iPadOS applications[edit]\n\n\nOn Macs based on Apple silicon, macOS Big Sur can run iOS and iPadOS applications natively and without any modifications needed from developers, aside from allowing the app to be available on the Mac App Store.[19] The first Macs with this capability are those that use the Apple M1 SoC (system on a chip).\n\n\n\n#### Time Machine overhaul[edit]\n\n\nTime Machine, the backup mechanism introduced back in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, has been overhauled to utilize the APFS file system (introduced in MacOS High Sierra) instead of the outdated HFS+. Specifically, the new version of Time Machine makes use of APFS's snapshot technology.[23][24][25] According to Apple, this enables \"faster, more compact, and more reliable backups\" than were possible previously with HFS+-formatted backup destinations.[23][26] An independent evaluation of this claim found that Time Machine on macOS 11 in conjunction with APFS was 2.75-fold faster upon initial local backup and 4-fold faster upon subsequent backups relative to macOS 10.15's Time Machine implementation using HFS+.[26] A more modest yet nevertheless significant advantage was noted as well for backups to network-attached disks.[26]\n\n\nNew local (i.e. USB- or Thunderbolt-connected) and network-connected Time Machine backup destinations are formatted as APFS by default, though Time Machine can continue backing up to existing HFS+ backup volumes.[23] There is no option to convert existing, HFS+-based backups to APFS; instead, users who want to benefit from the advantages of the new, APFS-based implementation of Time Machine need to start with a fresh volume.[26]\n\n\nIn the new version of Time Machine, encryption appears to be required (instead of merely optional) for local disks, but it remains elective for networked volumes.[26]\n\n\nIt is no longer possible to restore the whole system using a Time Machine backup, as the signed system volume is not backed up. Non-core applications and user data can be restored in full using Migration Assistant, preceded by a system reinstall if necessary.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Spotlight[edit]\n\n\nSpotlight, the file system indexing-and-search mechanism introduced in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, is faster and the interface has been refined. Spotlight is now the default search mechanism in Safari, Pages, and Keynote.[27][28]\n\n\n\n#### Signed system volume[edit]\n\n\nThe system volume containing the core operating system is cryptographically signed. Apple indicates this is a security measure to prevent malicious tampering.[29] This includes adding an SHA-256 hash for every file on the system volume, preventing changes from third-party entities and the end user.[30]\n\n\n\n#### Software updates[edit]\n\n\nSoftware updates can begin in the background before a restart, thus requiring less downtime to complete. Because system files are cryptographically signed, the update software can rely on them being in precise locations, thus permitting them to be effectively updated in place.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Encryption[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Big Sur supports encryption at the file level. Earlier versions of macOS (10.15 Catalina and older) supported encryption only at the level of entire volumes.[25] As of June 2020, this capability is known to be compatible with Macs based on Apple silicon; it is unclear whether it is compatible with Intel-based Macs.[25]\n\n\n\n### Other changes[edit]\n\n\n* Bilingual dictionaries in French\u2013German, Indonesian\u2013English, Japanese\u2013Simplified Chinese and Polish\u2013English\n* Better predictive input for Chinese and Japanese users\n* New fonts for Indian users\n* The \"Now Playing\" widget has been moved from the Notification Center to the Menu Bar\n* Podcasts \"Listen Now\" feature\n* FaceTime sign language prominence\n* Network Utility has been removed\n* The macOS startup sound is now enabled by default (it had been disabled by default on some machines released in 2016), and an option in System Preferences was added to enable or disable this functionality.[31]\n\n\n## Application features[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **is in list format but may read better as prose**.

Safari 14 includes features such as a new home page in which users can customize what features are visible in addition to being able to set a custom wallpaper. It also allows the viewer to preview a page and favicon before visiting it.[32]\n\n\nSafari 14 also includes built-in web page translations in English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Chinese and Portuguese as well as support for 4K HDR content from Netflix on Macs with an Apple T2 chip, although none of these were made available for macOS Catalina and Mojave.[32][33]\n\n\nPrivacy features such as iCloud Keychain (which notifies users of compromised passwords), extension privacy management and Privacy Report (which monitors privacy trackers and further increases Safari's security) were added for Safari 14.[34] Users were now also able to import password from Google's Chrome browser in addition to being notified of compromised passwords.\n\n\nSafari 14 also supports WebExtensions API, the WebP image format as well as VP9 decoding, the latter of which allows for the playback of 4K and HDR content from YouTube. In addition, it allowed for better performance and power efficiency.\n\n\nSafari 14 ended support for Adobe Flash Player in September, 3 months prior to its end-of-life on December 31, 2020.[34]\n\n\n\n### Messages[edit]\n\n\nThe Messages app was rewritten to be based upon Apple's Catalyst technology[35] to enable it to have feature parity with its iOS counterpart. The new version of the app included a refined design as well as the ability to pin up to nine conversations that can sync across iOS, iPadOS and macOS. Users were also now allowed to search for messages and share their names and photos. Photo thumbnails could now also be used for group chats on the app.\n\n\nIn addition, users could mention contacts by putting the @ symbol in front of their name. They were also able to reply to specific messages. Memojis, 3d avatars were also made available on Messages.[36] On Messages, users could now select photos based on parameters.[37]\n\n\nIn India, text message effects were added when users sent certain texts (e.g., texting \"Happy Holi\" will result in users seeing effects).\n\n\n\n### Changes to the Mac App Store[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mac App Store showing the Safari Extensions category\nRefinements and new features of the Mac App Store include:\n\n\n\n* A new \"nutrition label\" section dedicated to the data and information an app collects, also featured in the iOS App Store\n* A new extensions category for Safari\n* Third party Notification Center widgets, similar to those also added in iOS and iPadOS 14.\n* The ability to share in-app purchases and subscriptions on the Mac via iCloud Family Sharing\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n* Collapsible pinned section\n* Quick text style and formatting options\n* Scanning enhancements\n\n\n### Photos[edit]\n\n\n* New editing capabilities\n* Improved Retouch tool\n* New zooming feature in views\n\n\n### Maps[edit]\n\n\n* \"Look Around\" interactive street-level 360\u00b0 panoramas, first implemented in the iOS 13 version of Maps, have been incorporated into the macOS version of Maps.\n* Availability of directions for cyclists.\n* Electric vehicle routing, based on proximity to charging stations and monitoring of battery levels (on selected car models).\n* Guides for exploring new places.\n\n\n### Voice Memos[edit]\n\n\n* a file structure has been implemented to allow organization of recordings in folders[38]\n* recordings can be marked as Favorites for easier subsequent access\n* Smart Folders automatically group Apple Watch recordings, recently deleted recordings, and Favorites\n* audio can be enhanced to reduce background noise and room reverb\n\n\n### Other applications found in macOS 11 Big Sur[edit]\n\n\n* About This Mac\n* Activity Monitor\n* AirPort Utility\n* Archive Utility\n* Audio MIDI Setup\n* Automator\n* Bluetooth File Exchange\n* Books\n* Boot Camp Assistant\n* Calculator\n* Calendar\n* Chess\n* ColorSync Utility\n* Console\n* Contacts\n* Dictionary\n* Digital Color Meter\n* Directory Utility\n* Disk Utility\n* DVD Player\n* Expansion Slot Utility\n* FaceTime\n* Feedback Assistant\n* Find My\n* Finder\n* Folder Actions Setup\n* Font Book\n* Grapher\n* Home\n* Image Capture\n* iOS App Installer\n* Keychain Access\n* Mail\n* Launchpad\n* Migration Assistant\n* Mission Control\n* Music\n* Network Utility\n* News (only available for Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and United States)\n* Photo Booth\n* Podcasts\n* Preview\n* QuickTime Player\n* Reminders\n* Screenshot (succeeded Grab since macOS 10.14 Mojave)\n* Script Editor\n* Siri\n* Stickies\n* Stocks\n* Storage Management\n* System Information\n* Terminal\n* TextEdit\n* Ticket Viewer\n* Time Machine\n* TV\n* VoiceOver Utility\n* Wireless Diagnostics\n\n## Removed functionality[edit]\n\n\n* Calculator Notification Center Widget[39]\n* Option to toggle Font Smoothing in System Preferences\n* Support in Safari for AdBlock plugins like uBlock Origin\n* Removed the option not to have a clock in the menu bar.\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nThe rollout of Big Sur came with several problems.[40] Upgrading to the initial public release of Big Sur (version 11.0.1) bricked some computers, rendering them unusable. Many of these were 2013 and 2014 MacBook Pros, though problems were also observed on a 2019 MacBook Pro and an iMac from the same year.[41][42][43] The initial rollout also disrupted Apple's app notarization process, causing slowdowns even on devices not running Big Sur.[44] Users also reported that the update was slow or even might fail to install.[45] macOS Catalina and Big Sur apps were taking a long time to load because of Gatekeeper issues.[46]\n\n\nThe issues with the COVID-19 pandemic meant it was hard for users to visit an Apple Store to get their machines fixed.[47] Shortly afterwards, Apple released a series of steps explaining how these Macs could be recovered.[48]\n\n\nCertain Apple applications running on early versions of Big Sur were reported to bypass firewalls, raising privacy and security concerns.[49][50] This was addressed with the release of macOS Big Sur 11.2, which removed the whitelist for built-in programs.[51][52] Conversely, security experts have reported that Big Sur will check an application's certificate every time it is run, degrading system performance. There have been reports that the operating system sends a hash back to Apple of every program run and when it was executed.[53] Apple responded that the process is part of efforts to protect users from malware embedded in applications downloaded outside of the Mac App Store.[53]\n\n\nSome users have reported problems connecting external displays to Macs running Big Sur 11.1 and 11.2.[54]\n\n\nWhen upgrading Macs from 10.13, 10.14 and 10.15 to Big Sur the upgrade process could become stuck for seemingly unclear reasons. Only a full system restore from backup would solve this problem. In October 2021, a solution became known that required removal of up to several hundreds of thousands excess temporary files in the system folders.[55]\n\n\n\n## Vulnerability[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, there were reports of two pieces of malware that infected macOS and include both x86-64 and ARM64 code. The first one was detected in early 2021.[56] The second one, Silver Sparrow, was detected on nearly 30,000 Macs in February 2021.[57][58][59]\n\n\n\n## Release history[edit]\n\n\nThe public release of macOS 11 Big Sur began with 11.0.1 for Intel Macs. Version 11.0 was preinstalled on Apple silicon Macs, and Apple advised those with that version to be updated to 11.0.1.[60]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Previous release\n |  | Current release\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Version\n | Build\n | Release date\n | Darwin version\n | Release notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 11.0[a] | 20A2411\n | November 17, 2020\n | 20.1.0xnu-7195.41.8~9 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.0.1\n | 20B29[b] | November 12, 2020\n | 20.1.0xnu-7195.50.7~2 |\n| 20B50[c] | November 19, 2020\n |\n| 11.1\n | 20C69\n | December 14, 2020\n | 20.2.0xnu-7195.60.75~1 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.2\n | 20D64\n | February 1, 2021\n | 20.3.0xnu-7195.81.3~1 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.2.1\n | 20D74\n | February 9, 2021\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 20D75[d] | February 15, 2021\n |\n| 11.2.2\n | 20D80\n | February 25, 2021\n | Release notes |\n| 11.2.3\n | 20D91\n | March 8, 2021\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.3\n | 20E232\n | April 26, 2021\n | 20.4.0xnu-7195.101.1~3 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.3.1\n | 20E241\n | May 3, 2021\n | 20.4.0xnu-7195.101.2~1 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.4\n | 20F71\n | May 24, 2021\n | 20.5.0xnu-7195.121.3~9 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.5\n | 20G71\n | July 21, 2021\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.2~5Wed Jun 23 00:26:31 PDT 2021 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.5.1\n | 20G80\n | July 26, 2021\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.5.2\n | 20G95\n | August 11, 2021\n | Release notes |\n| 11.6\n | 20G165\n | September 13, 2021\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.6~3Mon Aug 30 06:12:21 PDT 2021 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.1\n | 20G224\n | October 25, 2021\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.8~1Tue Oct 12 18:33:42 PDT 2021 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.2\n | 20G314\n | December 13, 2021\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.14~1Wed Nov 10 22:23:07 PST 2021 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.3\n | 20G415\n | January 26, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.19~2Wed Jan 12 22:22:42 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.4\n | 20G417\n | February 14, 2022\n | Release notes |\n| 11.6.5\n | 20G527\n | March 14, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.26~1Tue Feb 22 21:10:41 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.6\n | 20G624\n | May 16, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.29~1Tue Apr 19 21:04:45 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.6.7\n | 20G630\n | June 9, 2022\n | Release notes |\n| 11.6.8\n | 20G730\n | July 20, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.32~1Tue Jun 21 20:50:28 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7\n | 20G817\n | September 12, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.39~2Mon Aug 29 04:31:06 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.1\n | 20G918\n | October 24, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.42~1Thu Sep 29 20:15:11 PDT 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.2\n | 20G1020\n | December 13, 2022\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.46~1Sun Nov 6 23:17:00 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.3\n | 20G1116\n | January 23, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49~1Fri Dec 16 00:35:00 PST 2022 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.4\n | 20G1120\n | February 15, 2023\n | Release notes |\n| 11.7.5\n | 20G1225\n | March 27, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49.700.6~1Thu Mar 9 20:39:26 PST 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.6\n | 20G1231\n | April 10, 2023\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.7\n | 20G1345\n | May 18, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49.701.3~1Mon Apr 24 23:00:57 PDT 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.8\n | 20G1351\n | June 21, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49.701.4~1Thu Jun 8 22:36:09 PDT 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.9\n | 20G1426\n | July 24, 2023\n | 20.6.0xnu-7195.141.49.702.12~1Thu Jul 6 22:12:47 PDT 2023 | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n| 11.7.10\n | 20G1427\n | September 11, 2023\n | Release notes\nSecurity content\n |\n\n\n*See Apple's main pages for Big Sur release notes: for consumers, for enterprise, as well as their current security content page.*\n\n\n\n1. **^** Preinstalled on MacBook Air (M1, 2020), MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020), and Mac mini (M1, 2020)\n2. **^** Initial public release\n3. **^** Available for all Macs except Late 2013 and Mid 2014 13\" MacBook Pros\n4. **^** Fixes bug where installation with insufficient free space could cause data loss \u2013 exclusive to the full installer\n\n## Timeline of Mac operating systems[edit]\n\n\n| Timeline of Mac operating systems * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n |\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rossignol, Joe (November 10, 2020). \"Apple Releasing macOS Big Sur on November 12\". *MacRumors*.

It is the successor to macOS Mojave and was announced at WWDC 2019 on June 3, 2019 and released to the public on October 7, 2019. Catalina is the first version of macOS to support only 64-bit applications and the first to include Activation Lock.[3][1] It is also the last version of macOS to have the major version number of 10; its successor, Big Sur, released on November 12, 2020, is version 11.[4][5] In order to increase web compatibility, Safari, Chromium and Firefox have frozen the OS in the user agent running in subsequent releases of macOS at 10.15.7 Catalina.[6][7][8]\n\n\nThe operating system is named after Santa Catalina Island, which is located off the coast of southern California. \n\n\nmacOS Catalina is the final version of macOS that supports the Unibody MacBook Pro, as its successor, macOS Big Sur, drops support for its mid 2012 and final model.\n\n\n\n\n## System requirements[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Catalina officially runs on all standard configuration Macs that supported Mojave. 2010 to 2012 Mac Pros, which could run Mojave only with a GPU upgrade, are no longer supported.[1] Catalina requires 4 GB of memory, an increase over the 2 GB required by Lion through Mojave.[9][10]\n\n\n\n* iMac (Late 2012 or later)\n* iMac Pro (2017)\n* MacBook (Early 2015 or later)\n* MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later)\n* MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or later)\n* Mac Mini (Late 2012 or later)\n* Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later)\n\n\nIt is possible to install Catalina on many older Macintosh computers that are not officially supported by Apple. This requires using a patch to modify the install image.[11]\n\n\n\n## Changes[edit]\n\n\n### System[edit]\n\n\n#### Catalyst[edit]\n\n\nCatalyst is a new software-development tool that allows developers to write apps that can run on macOS, iOS and iPadOS. Apple demonstrated several ported apps, including Jira and Twitter (after the latter discontinued its macOS app in February 2018).[12][13][14]\n\n\n\n#### System extensions[edit]\n\n\nAn upgrade from Kexts. System extensions avoid the problems of Kexts. There are 3 kinds of System extensions: Network Extensions, Endpoint Security Extensions, and Driver Extensions. System extensions run in userspace, outside of the kernel.[15][16] Catalina will be the last version of macOS to support legacy system extensions.[17][18]\n\n\n\n#### DriverKit[edit]\n\n\nA replacement for IOKit device drivers, driver extensions are built using DriverKit. DriverKit is a new SDK with all-new frameworks based on IOKit, but updated and modernized. It is designed for building device drivers in userspace, outside of the kernel.[19][16]\n\n\n\n#### Gatekeeper[edit]\n\n\nMac apps, installer packages, and kernel extensions that are signed with a Developer ID must be notarized by Apple to run on macOS Catalina.[20]\n\n\n\n#### Activation Lock[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Laptop theft\n\nActivation Lock helps prevent the unauthorized use and drive erasure of devices with an Apple T2 security chip (2018, 2019, and 2020 MacBook Pro; 2020 5K iMac; 2018 MacBook Air, iMac Pro; 2018 Mac Mini; 2019 Mac Pro).[1][21]\n\n\n\n#### Dedicated system volume[edit]\n\n\nThe system runs on its own read-only volume, separate from all other data on the Mac.[1]\n\n\n\n#### Voice control[edit]\n\n\nUsers can give detailed voice commands to applications.[22] On-device machine processing is used to offer better navigation.[1]\n\n\n\n#### Sidecar[edit]\n\n\nSidecar allows a Mac to use an iPad (running iPadOS) as a wireless external display. With Apple Pencil, the device can also be used as a graphics tablet for software running on the computer.[13][23] Sidecar requires a Mac with Intel Skylake CPUs and newer (such as the fourth-generation MacBook Pro), and an iPad that supports Apple Pencil.[24][25]\n\n\n\n#### Support for wireless game controllers[edit]\n\n\nThe Game Controller framework adds support for two major console game controllers: the PlayStation 4's DualShock 4 and the Xbox One controller.[26][27][28][29]\n\n\n\n#### Time Machine[edit]\n\n\nA number of under-the-hood changes were made to Time Machine, the backup software. For example, the manner in which backup data is stored on network-attached devices was changed, and this change is not backwards-compatible with earlier versions of macOS.[30]\nApple declined to document these changes, but some of them have been noted.[30]\n\n\n\n### Applications[edit]\n\n\n#### iTunes[edit]\n\n\niTunes is replaced by separate Music, Podcasts, TV and Books apps, in line with iOS. iOS device management is now conducted via Finder.[31][32] The TV app on Mac supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and HDR10 on MacBooks released in 2018 or later, while 4K HDR playback is supported on Macs released in 2018 or later when connected to a compatible display.[13]\n\n\n\n#### Find My[edit]\n\n\nFind My Mac and Find My Friends are merged into an application called Find My.\n\n\n\n#### Notes[edit]\n\n\nThe Notes application was enhanced to allow better management of checklists and the ability to share folders with other users. The application version was incremented from 4.6 (in macOS 10.14 Mojave) to 4.7.\n\n\n\n#### Reminders[edit]\n\n\nAmong other visual and functional overhauls, attachments can be added to reminders and Siri can intelligently estimate when to remind the user about an event.[1]\n\n\n\n#### Voice Memos[edit]\n\n\nThe Voice Memos application, first ported from iOS to the Mac in macOS 10.14 Mojave as version 2.0, was incremented to version 2.1.\n\n\n\n#### Removed or changed components[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Catalina exclusively supports 64-bit applications. 32-bit applications no longer run (including all software that utilizes the Carbon API as well as QuickTime 7 applications, image, audio and video codecs). Apple has also removed all 32-bit-only apps from the Mac App Store.[33]\n\n\nZ shell (executable \"zsh\") is the default login shell and interactive shell in macOS Catalina,[34] replacing Bash, the default shell since Mac OS X Panther in 2003.[35] Bash continues to be available in macOS Catalina, along with other shells such as csh/tcsh and ksh.\n\n\nDashboard has been removed in macOS Catalina.[36]\n\n\nThe ability to add Backgrounds in Photo Booth was removed in macOS Catalina.\n\n\nThe command-line interface GNU Emacs application was removed in macOS Catalina.\n\n\nBuilt-in support for Perl, Python 2.7 and Ruby are included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software.[37] Future versions of macOS will not include scripting language runtimes by default, possibly requiring users to install additional packages.[38]\n\n\nLegacy AirDrop for connecting with Macs running Mac OS X Lion, Mountain Lion and Mavericks, or 2011 and older Macs has been removed.[39]\n\n\n\n## Security[edit]\n\n\n*Ars Technica* reported that macOS Catalina contained a critical privilege escalation vulnerability, which resulted in a backdoor being installed if users visited a Hong Kong pro-democracy website. The vulnerability was reported to Apple in August 2021, and patched in a Catalina update in September, but it had already been patched by Apple in macOS Big Sur 11.2, released 234 days earlier on February 1. Security experts have criticized Apple for not patching critical known vulnerabilities in older versions, and for not being transparent about older versions only receiving some, but not all, security patches. The latest major release of Apple's operating systems (macOS, iOS, and others) receive all security updates.[40][41][42]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nCatalina received favorable reviews on release for some of its features.[43] However, some critics found the OS version distinctly less reliable than earlier versions.[44][45][46][47][48] The broad addition of user-facing security measures (somewhat analogous to the addition of User Account Control dialog boxes with Windows Vista a decade earlier) was criticized as intrusive and annoying.[46][49]\n\n\n\n## Release

Mojave was announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 4, 2018, and was released to the public on September 24, 2018. The operating system's name refers to the Mojave Desert, and is part of a series of California-themed names that began with OS X Mavericks.[4] It succeeded macOS High Sierra and was followed by macOS Catalina. macOS Mojave is the last version of macOS that features the iTunes and Dashboard apps.\n\n\nmacOS Mojave brings several iOS apps to the desktop operating system, including Apple News, Voice Memos, and Home. It also includes a more comprehensive \"dark mode\", is the final version of macOS to support 32-bit application software,[5][6] is the last version of the macOS capable of being booted from an HFS+ partition without third-party patching, and is also the last version of macOS to support the iPhoto app, which had already been superseded in OS X Yosemite (10.10) by the newer Photos app.\n\n\nMojave was well received and was supplemented by point releases after launch.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Mojave was announced on June 4, 2018, at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California.[1][7][8] Apple pitched Mojave, named after the California desert, as adding \"pro\" features that would benefit all users. The developer preview of the operating system was released for developers the same day,[8] followed by a public beta on June 26.[9] The retail version of 10.14 was released on September 24, 2018.[10]\n\n\n\n## System requirements[edit]\n\n\nMojave requires a GPU that supports Metal, and the list of compatible systems is more restrictive than the previous version, macOS High Sierra.[11] Mojave drops support for various Macs released from late 2009 to 2011. Compatible models are the following Macintosh computers running OS X Mountain Lion or later:[12]\n\n\n\n* iMac (Late 2012 or later)\n* iMac Pro (2017)\n* MacBook (Early 2015 or later)\n* MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later)\n* MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or later)\n* Mac Mini (Late 2012 or later)\n* Mac Pro (2013, 2010\u20132012 supported with a Metal-capable graphics card)[13]\n\n\nmacOS Mojave requires at least 2\u00a0GB of RAM as well as 12.5\u00a0GB of available disk space to upgrade from OS X El Capitan, macOS Sierra, or macOS High Sierra, or 18.5\u00a0GB of disk space to upgrade from OS X Yosemite and earlier releases. Some features are not available on all compatible models.[14] Mojave installations convert the installation volume to Apple File System (APFS), if the volume had not previously been converted from HFS+.[15]\n\n\nIt is possible to install Mojave on many older Macintosh computers that are not officially supported by Apple. This requires using a patch to modify the install image.[16]\n\n\n\n## Changes[edit]\n\n\n### System updates[edit]\n\n\nmacOS Mojave deprecates support for several legacy features of the OS. The graphics frameworks OpenGL and OpenCL are still supported by the operating system, but will no longer be maintained; developers are encouraged to use Apple's Metal library instead.[17]\n\n\nOpenGL is a cross-platform graphics framework designed to support a wide range of processors. Apple chose OpenGL in the late 1990s to build support for software graphics rendering into the Mac, after abandoning QuickDraw 3D. At the time, moving to OpenGL allowed Apple to take advantage of existing libraries that enabled hardware acceleration on a variety of different GPUs. As time went on, Apple has shifted its efforts towards building its hardware platforms for mobile and desktop use. Metal makes use of the homogenized hardware by abandoning the abstraction layer and running on the \"bare metal\". Metal reduces CPU load, shifting more tasks to the GPU. It reduces driver overhead and improves multithreading, allowing every CPU thread to send commands to the GPU.[18]\n\n\nmacOS does not natively support Vulkan, the Khronos group's official successor to OpenGL. The MoltenVK library can be used as a bridge, translating most of the Vulkan 1.0 API into the Metal API.[19][20]\n\n\nContinuing the process started in macOS High Sierra (10.13), which issued warnings about compatibility with 32-bit applications, Mojave issues warnings when opening 32-bit apps that they will not be supported in future updates. In macOS Mojave 10.14, this alert appears once every 30 days when launching the app, as macOS 10.15 will not support 32-bit applications.[6]\n\n\nWhen Mojave is installed, it will convert solid-state drives (SSDs), hard disk drives (HDDs), and Fusion Drives, from HFS Plus to APFS. On Fusion Drives using APFS, files will be moved to the SSD based on the file's frequency of use and its SSD performance profile. APFS will also store all metadata for a Fusion Drive's file system on the SSD.[21]\n\n\nNew data protections require applications to get permission from the user before using the Mac camera and microphone or accessing system data like user Mail history and Messages database.[22]\n\n\n\n### Removed features[edit]\n\n\nMojave removes integration with Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, and Flickr, which was added in OS X Mountain Lion.[23]\n\n\nMojave also removes support for sub-pixel rendering of text. The feature was previously used on non-Retina displays to improve the appearance of text on screen.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe only supported Nvidia graphics cards are the Quadro K5000 and GeForce GTX 680 Mac Edition.[24][25]\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\nMojave features changes to existing applications as well as new ones. Finder now has metadata preview accessed via View > Show Preview, and many other updates,[26] including a Gallery View (replacing Cover Flow) that lets users browse through files visually.[27] After a screenshot is taken, as with iOS, the image appears in the corner of the display. The screenshot software can now record video, choose where to save files, and be opened via `\u21e7 Shift` + `\u2318 Command` + `5`.[28]\n\n\nSafari's Tracking Prevention features now prevent social media \"Like\" or \"Share\" buttons and comment widgets from tracking users without permission. The browser also sends less information to web servers about the user's system, reducing the chance of being tracked based on system configuration.[29] It can also automatically create, autofill, and store strong passwords when users create new online accounts; it also flags reused passwords so users can change them.[30]\n\n\nA new Screenshot app was added to macOS Mojave to replace the Grab app. Screenshot can capture a selected area, window or the entire screen as well as screen record a selected area or the entire display. The Screenshot app is located in the `/Applications/Utilities/` folder, as was the Grab app. Screenshot can also be accessed by pressing `\u21e7 Shift`+`\u2318 Command`+`3`.\n\n\n\n### FaceTime[edit]\n\n\nmacOS 10.14.1, released on October 30, 2018, adds Group FaceTime, which lets users chat with up to 32 people at the same time, using video or audio from an iPhone, iPad or Mac, or audio from Apple Watch. Participants can join in mid-conversation.[31]\n\n\n\n### App Store[edit]\n\n\nThe Mac App Store was rewritten from the ground up and features a new interface and editorial content, similar to the iOS App Store. A new 'Discover' tab highlights new and updated apps; Create, Work, Play and Develop tabs help users find apps for a specific project or purpose.[32]\n\n\n\n### iOS apps ported to macOS[edit]\n\n\nFour new apps (News, Stocks, Voice Memos and Home) are ported to macOS Mojave from iOS, with Apple implementing a subset of UIKit on the desktop OS.[33] Third-party developers would be able to port iOS applications to macOS in 2019.[34]\n\n\nWith Home, Mac users can control their HomeKit-enabled accessories to do things like turn lights off and on or adjust thermostat settings. Voice Memos lets users record audio (e.g., personal notes, lectures, meetings, interviews, or song ideas), and access them from iPhone, iPad or Mac. Stocks delivers curated market news alongside a personalized watchlist, with quotes and charts.[35]\n\n\n\n## User interface[edit]\n\n\n### Dark mode and accent colors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Light-on-dark color scheme\n\nMojave introduces \"Dark Mode\", a Light-on-dark color scheme that darkens the user interface to make content stand out while the interface recedes.[36] Users can choose dark or light mode when installing Mojave, or any time thereafter from System Preferences.[37]\n\n\nApple's built-in apps support Dark Mode.[37] App developers can implement Dark mode in their apps via a public API.[38]\n\n\nA limited dark mode that affected only the Dock, menu bar, and drop-down menus was previously introduced in OS X Yosemite.[5]\n\n\n\n### Desktop[edit]\n\n\nStacks, a feature introduced in Mac OS X Leopard, now lets users group desktop files into groups based on file attributes such as file kind, date last opened, date modified, date created, name and tags.[27][28] This is accessed via View > Use Stacks.[26]\n\n\nmacOS Mojave features a new Dynamic Desktop that automatically changes specially made desktop backgrounds (two of which are included)[39] to match the time of day.[40]\n\n\n\n### Dock[edit]\n\n\nThe Dock has a space for recently used apps that have not previously been added to the Dock.[26]\n\n\n\n### Preferences[edit]\n\n\nmacOS update functionality has been moved back to System Preferences from the Mac App Store.[26][41] In OS X Mountain Lion (10.8), system and app updates moved to the App Store from Software Update.[42]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nMojave was generally well received by technology press. *The Verge*'s Jacob Kastrenakes considered Mojave a relatively minor update and typical of 2010s macOS releases,[43] but Kastrenakes and Jason Snell thought the release hinted at the future direction of macOS.[44] In contrast, *Ars Technica*'s Andrew Cunningham felt that \"Mojave feels, if not totally transformative, at least more *consequential* than the last few macOS releases have felt.\" Cunningham highlighted productivity improvements and continued work on macOS's foundation.[15] TechCrunch's Brian Heater dubbed Mojave \"arguably the most focused macOS release in recent memory\", playing an important role in reassuring professional users that it was still committed to them.[45]\n\n\nMojave's new features were generally praised. Critics welcomed the addition of Dark Mode,[46][37][47] although some noted that its effect was inconsistent; *MacWorld*'s Karen Haslam noted that it did not affect the bright white background in Pages, for instance.[48] Others noted that Dark Mode's utility was curtailed by the lack of third-party developer support at release.[43]\n\n\n\n## Release history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Version\n | Build\n

It is frequently praised for its dramatic scenery. Big Sur has been called the \"longest and most scenic stretch of undeveloped coastline in the contiguous United States\",[1] a sublime \"national treasure that demands extraordinary procedures to protect it from development\",[2] and \"one of the most beautiful coastlines anywhere in the world, an isolated stretch of road, mythic in reputation\".[3] The views, redwood forests, hiking, beaches, and other recreational opportunities have made Big Sur a popular destination for visitors from across the world. With 4.5 to 7 million visitors annually,[4] it is among the top tourist destinations in the United States, comparable to Yosemite National Park, but with considerably fewer services, and less parking, roads, and related infrastructure.[5][6][7][8][9]\n\n\nBig Sur Village is a collection of small roadside businesses and homes.[10]:\u200a2 The larger region known as Big Sur does not have specific boundaries but is generally considered to include the 71-mile (114\u00a0km) segment of California State Route 1 between Malpaso Creek near Carmel Highlands[11] in the north and San Carp\u00f3foro Creek near San Simeon in the south,[12] as well as the entire Santa Lucia range between these creeks.[10] The interior region is mostly uninhabited, while the coast remains relatively isolated and sparsely populated, with between 1,800 and 2,000 year-round residents[13] and relatively few visitor accommodations scattered among four small settlements. The region remained one of the most inaccessible areas of California and the entire United States until, after 18 years of construction, the Carmel\u2013San Simeon Highway (now signed as part of State Route 1) was completed in 1937. Along with the ocean views, this winding, narrow road, often cut into the face of towering seaside cliffs, dominates the visitor's experience of Big Sur. The highway has been closed more than 55 times by landslides, and in May 2017, a 2,000,000-cubic-foot (57,000\u00a0m3) slide blocked the highway at Mud Creek, north of Salmon Creek near the San Luis Obispo County line, to just south of Gorda. The road was reopened on July 18, 2018.\n\n\nThe region is protected by the Big Sur Local Coastal Plan, which preserves it as \"open space, a small residential community, and agricultural ranching.\"[14] Approved in 1986, the plan is one of the most restrictive local-use programs in the state,[15] and is widely regarded as one of the most restrictive documents of its kind anywhere.[16] The program protects viewsheds from the highway and many vantage points, and severely restricts the density of development. About 60% of the coastal region is owned by governmental or private agencies which do not allow any development. The majority of the interior region is part of the Los Padres National Forest, Ventana Wilderness, Silver Peak Wilderness or Fort Hunter Liggett.\n\n\n\n\n## Location[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Approximate boundaries of the Big Sur region\nBig Sur is not an incorporated town but a region without formal boundaries in California's Central Coast region.[17] The region is often confused with the small community of buildings and services 26 miles (42\u00a0km) south of Carmel in the Big Sur River valley, sometimes referred to by locals as Big Sur Village, but officially known as Big Sur.[17][18][19]:\u200a8[20]:\u200a7[21] Some visitors think Big Sur only refers to Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, whose environmental setting is extremely different from the overall rocky coastal environment.[22]\n\n\n\n### Historical boundaries[edit]\n\n\nThe various informal boundaries applied to the region have gradually expanded north and south over time. Esther Pfeiffer Ewoldson, who was born in 1904 and was a granddaughter of Big Sur pioneers Michael and Barbara Pfeiffer, wrote that the region extended from the Little Sur River 23 miles (37\u00a0km) south to Slates Hot Springs. Members of the Harlan Family, who homesteaded the Lucia region 9 miles (14\u00a0km) south of Slates Hot Springs, said that Big Sur was \"miles and miles to the north of us.\"[19]:\u200a6 Prior to the construction of Highway 1, residents on the south coast had little contact with residents to the north of them.[19]\n\n\n\n### Northern and southern boundaries[edit]\n\n\nMost current descriptions of the area refer to Malpaso Creek 4.5 miles (7.2\u00a0km) south of the Carmel River as the northern border.[11][*failed verification*] The southern border is generally accepted to be San Carp\u00f3foro Creek in San Luis Obispo County.[12]\n\n\n\n### Settlements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of Gorda, one of the small clusters of services in Big Sur\nThe Big Sur region is largely rural and the 1,800 to 2,000 residents are widely distributed. There are a concentration of homes in the north at Palo Colorado Canyon, Big Sur Village, and Posts. Other residential areas include Otter Cove, Garrapata Ridge, Garrapata Canyon, Bixby Canyon, Pfeiffer Ridge, Sycamore Canyon, Coastlands, and Partington Ridge.\n\n\nIn the south, residents are in the vicinity of Slates Hot Springs, Plaskett, Lucia, and Gorda. Homes are also located near Burns Creek, Buck Creek to Lime Creek, Plaskett Ridge, and Redwood Gulch.[23]\n\n\n\n### Inland extent[edit]\n\n\nThe vast majority of visitors only see Big Sur's dramatic coastline and consider the Big Sur region to include only the coastal flanks of the Santa Lucia Mountains, which at various points extend from 3 to 12 miles (5 to 19\u00a0km) inland.[24]\n\n\nSome residents place the eastern border at the boundaries of the vast inland areas comprising the Los Padres National Forest, Ventana Wilderness, and Silver Peak Wilderness, or the unpopulated regions all the way to the eastern foothills of the Santa Lucia Mountains.[10] Author and local historian Jeff Norman considered Big Sur to extend inland to include the watersheds that drain into the Pacific Ocean.[20]:\u200a7\n\n\nAuthor Lillian Ross wrote about life in Big Sur in several books. She and her husband Harry Dick Ross lived in southern Big Sur near Lime Creek beginning in 1939. Harry, a wood sculptor, worked at Hearst's estate in San Simeon as a tile-setter. She famously described Big Sur as \"not a place at all but a state of mind.\"[25][26][27]\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Big Sur: rocky coast, fog and giant kelp\nThe name \"Big Sur\" has its origins in the area's early Spanish history. While the Portol\u00e1 expedition was exploring Alta California, they arrived at San Carp\u00f3foro Canyon near present-day San Simeon on September 13, 1769. Unable to penetrate the difficult terrain along the coast, they detoured inland through the San Antonio and Salinas Valleys before arriving at Monterey Bay, where they founded Monterey and named it the provincial capital.[28]\n\n\nThe Spanish referred to the vast and relatively unexplored coastal region to the south of Monterey as *el pa\u00eds grande del sur*, meaning 'the big country of the south'. This was often shortened to *el sur grande* 'the big south'.[29][30] The two major rivers draining this portion of the coast were named El Rio Grande del Sur and El Rio Chiquito del Sur.[20]:\u200a7\n\n\nThe first recorded use of the name *el Sud* (meaning 'the South') was on a map of the Rancho El Sur land grant given by Governor Jos\u00e9 Figueroa to Juan Bautista Alvarado on July 30, 1834.[31] The first American use of the name 'Sur' was by the United States Coast Survey in 1851, which renamed a point of land that looked like an island and was shaped like a trumpet, known to the Spanish as *Morro de la Trompa* and *Punta Que Parece Isla*, to Point Sur.[21]\n\n\nBig Sur's first post office was named \"Posts\" after William Brainard Post, in whose home it was located. He had obtained a patent to land at the top of the grade south of the Big Sur River, where he built a home in 1867.[32] Confusion ensued when mail intended for the Presidio was sent to Big Sur, and mail for the local residents was sent to the military post. The residents changed the name of the post office to Arbolado ('woodland'), but that was confused by the post office for Alvarado, a street in Monterey. The post office operated at Posts from 1889 to 1910; it was moved in 1905 several miles northwest to Big Sur Village.[33] The English-speaking homesteaders petitioned the United States Post Office in Washington D.C. to change the name of their post office from Arbolado to Big Sur, and the rubber stamp using that name was returned on March 6, 1915, cementing the use of Big Sur as the place name.[19]:\u200a8[20]:\u200a7[34][21]\n\n\n\n## Popularity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Big Sur coast, looking north toward Bixby Creek Bridge\nBig Sur is renowned worldwide for its natural features and relatively pristine scenery. It is rated among the top 35 tourist destinations in the world.[5] The Big Sur coast has been called the \"longest and most scenic stretch of undeveloped coastline in the [contiguous] United States.\"[1] The region has been described as a \"national treasure that demands extraordinary procedures to protect it from development.\"[2] Robert Lindsey wrote in The *New York Times* that it is \"one of the most stunning meetings of land and sea in the world.\"[35] The *Washington Times* stated that it is \"one of the most beautiful coastlines anywhere in the world, an isolated stretch of road, mythic in reputation.\"[3] *Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler* named State Route 1 through Big Sur one of the top 10 world-famous streets, comparable to Broadway in New York City and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris.[36] Realtor Mark Peterson commented, \"Big Sur's popularity has erupted with the growth of social media. It has become a year-round destination.\"[37]\n\n\nWriters have compared Big Sur to other natural wonders like the Grand Canyon.[38] Novelist Herbert Gold described it as \"one of the grand American retreats for those who nourish themselves with wilderness.\"[39]\n\n\n\n\n> Big Sur is the California that men dreamed of years ago, this is the Pacific that Balboa looked at from the Peak of Darien, this is the face of the earth as the Creator intended it to look.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aHenry Miller[12]\n> \n\n\n### Scenic designations[edit]\n\n\nThe section of Highway 1 running through Big Sur is widely considered one of the most scenic driving routes in the United States, if not the world.[40][41][42] The views are one reason that Big Sur was ranked second among all United States destinations in TripAdvisor's 2008 Travelers' Choice Destination Awards.[43] The unblemished natural scenery owes much of its preservation to the highly restrictive development plans enforced in Big Sur; no billboards or advertisements are permitted along the highway and signage for businesses must be modestly scaled and of a rural nature conforming to the Big Sur region. The state of California designated the 72-mile (116\u00a0km) section of the highway from Cambria to Carmel Highlands as the first California Scenic Highway in 1965.[44][45] In 1966, First Lady Lady Bird Johnson led the official scenic road designation ceremony at Bixby Creek Bridge.[46] In 1996, the road became one of the first designated by the federal government as an \"All-American Road\" under the National Scenic Byways Program.[6][47][48][49] CNN Traveler named McWay Falls as the most beautiful place in California.[50]\n\n\n\n### Driving popularity[edit]\n\n\nThe drive along Highway 1 has been described as \"one of the best drives on Earth\", and is considered one of the top 10 motorcycle rides in the United States.[51] Highway 1 was named the most popular drive in California in 2014 by the American Automobile Association.[52] The region receives as many and sometimes more visitors than Yosemite National Park. Unlike the national park managed by a single entity, the Big Sur region is ruled over by multiple government and private land owners, offers only occasional bus service, limited parking, few restrooms, and a single, narrow two-lane highway that for most of its length clings to the steep coastal cliffs. North-bound traffic during the peak summer season and holiday weekends is often backed up for about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) from Big Sur Village to Carmel Highlands. Due to the large number of visitors during the summer, congestion and slow traffic between Carmel and Posts is becoming the norm.[8][7][5][9][6] However, during the winter, the road is frequently closed due to washouts and slides.\n\n\n\n### Protection[edit]\n\n\nDespite its popularity, the region is heavily protected to preserve the rural and natural character of the land. The entire Big Sur coast is located within the protected coastal zone established by the 1976 California Coastal Act. This includes land use within a defined \"coastal zone\" extending inland from 3,000\u00a0ft (910\u00a0m) up to 5\u00a0mi (8.0\u00a0km). The California Coastal Commission has the authority to control the construction of any type, including buildings, housing, roads, as well as fire and erosion abatement structures, and can issue fines for unapproved construction. The Coastal Zone is specifically defined by law as an area that extends from the State's seaward boundary of jurisdiction, and inland for a distance from the Mean High Tide Line of between a couple of hundred feet in urban areas, to up to five miles in rural areas.[53] The Big Sur Local Coastal Plan, approved by the Monterey County Supervisors in 1981, states that the region is meant to be an experience that visitors transit through, not a destination. For that reason, development of all kinds is severely restricted.[54]\n\n\n\n## Attractions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bixby Creek Bridge, shown here looking southwest, is a popular attraction in Big Sur.\n![](image)Bixby Creek Bridge at night\nBesides sightseeing from the highway, Big Sur offers hiking and outdoor activities. There are a large number of state and federal lands and parks, including McWay Falls at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park, one of only two waterfalls in California that plunge directly into the ocean. The waterfall is located near the foundation of a grand stone cliffside house built in 1940 by Lathrop and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Hooper Brown which was the region's first electrified home. However, parking is very limited and usually unavailable on summer weekends and holidays.[55]\n\n\nAnother notable landmark is Point Sur Lightstation, the only complete nineteenth century lighthouse complex open to the public in California.[56]\n\n\nThe Ventana Wildlife Center near Andrew Molera State Park features a free Discovery Center that enables visitors to learn about the California Condor recovery program and other wildlife.[57]\n\n\nThe Henry Miller Memorial Library is a nonprofit bookstore and arts center that opened in 1981 as a tribute to the writer. Miller lived in Big Sur from 1944 to February 1963 and wrote about Big Sur in his book Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch. It is a gathering place for locals and has become the focal point of individuals with a literary mind,[58] a cultural center devoted to Miller's life and work, and a popular attraction for tourists.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Santa Lucia Range from Nepenthe restaurant\n### Camping[edit]\n\n\nThere are both public and private campgrounds along the coast. Kirk Creek, Limekiln, and Plaskett Creek Campgrounds are located very near Highway 1. The public sites accommodate at least one vehicle while Plaskett Creek offers large group camping. The public campgrounds are privately managed and filled months ahead of time.[61] Dispersed camping along local roads or state highways is illegal and violators are regularly cited. Sleeping in cars is illegal and subject to a $1000 fine.[62]\n\n\n\n### Beaches[edit]\n\n\nThere are a few small, scenic beaches that are accessible to the public and popular for walking, but usually unsuitable for swimming, because of unpredictable currents, frigid temperatures, and dangerous surf.[63] The beach at Garrapata State Park is sometimes rated as the best beach in Big Sur. Depending on the season, visitors can view sea otters, sea lions, seals, and migrating whales from the beach. The beach is barely visible from Highway 1.[63]\n\n\nPfeiffer Beach is very popular but is only accessible via the narrow 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) Sycamore Canyon Road. The parking lot at the beach only accommodates 60 vehicles and is usually full on summer and holiday weekends. During the summer, a shuttle operates from the US Forest Service headquarters to the beach. The wide sandy expanse offers views of a scenic arch rock offshore. It is sometimes confused with the beach at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park to the south.[63]\n\n\nIn the south, Sand Dollar Beach is the longest stretch of beach in Big Sur. It is popular with hikers and photographers for its views of nearby bluffs. The beach is 25 miles (40\u00a0km) south of the Big Sur village on Highway 1. A steep staircase leads down to the beach from the highway.[63] Jade Cove, 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) south of Sand Dollar Beach, is also sometimes popular with visitors.\n\n\nSwiss Canyon Beach is a long, sandy beach that's visible when looking north from the mouth of the Big Sur River in Andrew Molera State Park. The eastern side of the beach is bounded by private land. The beach may be accessible from the southern end depending on the tide.[64]\n\n\nSome beaches are surrounded by private land. At the mouth of the Little Sur river are some of the largest dunes on the Big Sur coast. The mouth of the Little Sur River, the dunes, and the mile-long Little Sur River beach are within the boundaries of the El Sur Ranch and are inaccessible to the public. The owner of the ranch maintains a secure fence and has prominently posted \"Private Property\" and \"No Trespassing\" signs on the fence along Highway 1 as suggested by legal precedent.[65] While the beach below the mean high tide line is open to the public, the law does not permit individuals to trespass on private property to reach the public beach. Individuals who trespass to reach the beach have been cited.[66][67]\n\n\nOther beaches that are inaccessible to the public include Point Sur Beach, a long sandy beach located below and to the north of Point Sur Lighthouse.[68] There is a small beach at Rocky Point that is surrounded by private property, making it inaccessible. The beach at the foot of McWay falls is physically inaccessible from the shore. To the south near the county line, Wreck Beach south of Pfeiffer Beach is not accessible. Gamboa Point Beach near the Monterey / San Luis Obispo count line is closed to the public.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Hiking[edit]\n\n\nThe Pine Ridge Trail (USFS 3E06) is the most popular hiking route into the Ventana Wilderness. Hikers can use it to access many campsites in the backcountry, including Ventana Camp, Terrace Creek, Barlow Flats, Sykes, and Redwood camps. When open, it is accessible from the Big Sur Station. The trail, connecting trails, and the campsites along its route were closed during the Soberanes Fire in July 2016. They were damaged by the fire itself and further damaged by the heavy rains during the following winter. As of August\u00a02017[update], the trail was blocked by four major washouts and more than 100 fallen trees across the path. Reopening the trail will require an environmental assessment, and perhaps re-routing the trail entirely.\n\n\nThe Mt. Manuel Trail (USFS 2E06) begins within Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. It follows a northeasterly route up the slopes of Mt. Manuel. Hikers following this route can access Vado, Launtz Creek, and Tin House campsites. It connects to the Little Sur trail that provides access to the Little Sur River watershed. The trail is not maintained.[70]\n\n\nThe North Coast Ridge Road (USFS 20S05) is accessible from the road to the Ventana Inn and indirectly from the south via Limekiln State Park. Parking is available in the north at Cadillac Flat near the Ventana Inn. From Ventana Inn, the trail climbs steeply to the crest of the coastal ridge and south about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) to near Cone Peak. There are wide views in all directions for almost the entire hike. It connects to several trails over its length, including Terrace Creek Trail (closed as of January\u00a02018[update]), Boronda Trail, DeAngulo Trail, Big Sur Trail, Marble Peak Trail, Bee Camp Trail, Lost Valley Connector Trail, Rodeo Flat Trail, and the Arroyo Seco Trail. It provides access to Timber Top and Cold Spring Camp. It passes near the summit of Anderson Peak (4,099 feet (1,249\u00a0m)) and Marble Peak (4,031 feet (1,229\u00a0m)), and through to the Nacimiento-Fergusson Road and through connects to the Cone Peak Road. It is not open to vehicular traffic or bicycles. As of January\u00a02018[update], the trail is closed.[71][72]\n\n\nGarrapata State Park, Andrew Molera State Park, Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, and Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park all contain short hiking trails. As of January\u00a02018[update], almost all trails on the east side of Highway 1 in these parks are closed due to the Soberanes Fire and damage sustained during heavy rains the following winter. Some trails west of Highway 1 are open.[73]\n\n\n\n### Places of contemplation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An evening aerial view of the Esalen Institute\nAmong the places that draw visitors is the formerly counterculture but now upscale Esalen Institute. Esalen hosted many figures of the nascent \"New Age\" and, in the 1960s, played an important role in popularizing Eastern philosophies, the \"Human Potential Movement\", and Gestalt therapy in the United States.[39] Esalen is named after the Native Americans who congregated there at the natural hot springs possibly for thousands of years. Far from the coast within the Los Padres National Forest, the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, accessible via a steep, narrow, 12-mile (19\u00a0km) dirt road, is only open to guests during the summer months.\n\n\nBig Sur is also the location of a Catholic monastery, the New Camaldoli Hermitage. The Hermitage in Big Sur was founded in 1957. It rents a few simple rooms for visitors who would like to engage in silent meditation and contemplation. Normally all retreats are silent and undirected.[74]\n\n\n\n![](image)Historic menu cover from Nepenthe restaurant, a Big Sur icon since 1949[75]\n![](image)McWay Falls and McWay Cove\n### Special events[edit]\n\n\nThe Big Sur International Marathon is an annual marathon that begins south of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park and ends at the Crossroads Shopping Center in Carmel-by-the-Sea. The marathon was established in 1986 and attracts about 4,500 participants annually.[76]\n\n\nCivic leaders in Big Sur stage a run each year in October to raise funds for the Big Sur Volunteer Fire Brigade and the Big Sur Health Center. Since the race, known as the Big Sur River Run, was founded in 1971, more than $1,025,104 has been donated to the two organizations. The run through the redwoods was canceled in 2016 due to the Soberanes Fire and in 2017 due to winter storms.[77][78]\n\n\nThe Big Sur Folk Festival was held from 1964 to 1971. It began unintentionally when Nancy Carlen, a friend of singer Joan Baez, organized a weekend seminar at the Esalen Institute in June 1964 titled \"The New Folk Music\". On Sunday afternoon, they invited all the neighbors for a free, open performance. This became the first festival.[79] The festival was held yearly on the grounds of the Esalen Institute, except for 1970, when it was held at the Monterey County Fairgrounds. Even when well-known acts like Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young or the Beach Boys performed, the event was purposefully kept small with no more than a few thousand in attendance.[80]\n\n\n\n## State and federal lands[edit]\n\n\n### State parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Point Sur and light station from the north\nThe state parks in Big Sur grew out of the original residents' desire to protect and preserve the land they admired. \"The early settlers considered land stewardship their obligation to the community.\"[81] The first was Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. John Pfeiffer, son of pioneers Michael Pfeiffer and Barbara Laquet, was offered $210,000 for his land near Sycamore Canyon by a Los Angeles developer, who wanted to build a subdivision on the land. Instead, Pfeiffer sold 700 acres (2.8 km2) to the state of California in 1933.[82][83]\n\n\nAs of January\u00a02018[update], portions of most of these parks are closed due to after effects of the Soberanes Fire.[84]\nFrom north to south, the following state parks are in use:[85]\n\n\n\n* Garrapata State Park\n* Point Sur State Historic Park\n* Andrew Molera State Park\n* Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park\n* Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park\n* Limekiln State Park\n\n\n### State reserves[edit]\n\n\n* John Little State Natural Reserve\n* Big Creek State Marine Reserve and Marine Conservation Area\n\n\n### Federal land[edit]\n\n\nAs of January\u00a02018[update], some trails and campsites within the following areas are closed, due to damage caused by the 2016 Soberanes Fire and the following winter's rains.[85]\n\n\n\n* Pfeiffer Beach\n* Los Padres National Forest\n* Ventana Wilderness\n* Silver Peak Wilderness\n\n\n## Overuse issues[edit]\n\n\nDuring most summer weekends and on all major holidays, Big Sur is overwhelmingly crowded.[86] Although some Big Sur residents catered to adventurous travelers in the early twentieth century,[19]:\u200a10 the modern tourist economy began when Highway 1 opened the region to automobiles in 1937, but only took off after World War II-era gasoline rationing and a ban on pleasure driving ended in August 1945.[87] Big Sur has become a destination for travelers both within the United States and internationally.[88][89][90][91]\n\n\n\n### Increasing numbers of visitors[edit]\n\n\nThe number of visitors to Big Sur has risen from about 1.5 million in 1978,[87] to about 3 million in 1980,[92] to an estimated 4 to 5 million during 2014 and 2015, comparable to or greater than the number of visitors to Yosemite National Park.[93] Unlike Yosemite, which is managed by a single federal entity, about one-quarter of the land in Big Sur is privately owned and the remainder is managed by a conglomeration of federal, state, local, and private agencies. Yosemite offers 5,400 parking spots and a free, daily, park-wide bus service. In Big Sur during the summer, there is a single public bus that runs three times daily and a single shuttle van that operates on Thursday through Sunday from the Big Sur Station to Pfeiffer Beach.[94] The owner of the Nepenthe restaurant estimated in 2017 that the number of visitors had increased by 40% since 2011. Big Sur residents and business owners are concerned about the impact visitors are having on the region. Traffic and parking is consistently bad during summer and holidays weekends and some visitors don't obey the laws.[95][96]:\u200a6\n\n\nResidents began discussing the potential necessity of shuttle buses, tollgates along Highway 1, and limits on the number of private autos allowed on the highway in 1978.[87] One of the reasons for Big Sur's popularity is that it is only a one-day drive for about 7 million people. With the advent of social media, hashtags like \"#sykeshotsprings\" and \"#pineridgetrail\", two popular destinations within Big Sur, encourage more visitors.[86][97] Visitors must pay $15 for a parking spot at a trailhead parking lot and take a 14-passenger van to Pfeiffer Beach.[98][99][100][101][96]:\u200a6 In response to visitor abuses, an anonymous Big Sur resident began an Instagram account in May 2019 named BigSurHatesYou intended to shame visitors into treating the Big Sur region better.[102][103]\n\n\nThe television series *Big Little Lies*, which is filmed in the Monterey and Big Sur area, has increased the number of visitors to the area.[104]\n\n\n\n### Restricted public transportation[edit]\n\n\nPublic transportation is available to and from Monterey on Monterey\u2013Salinas Transit. The summer schedule operates from Memorial Day to Labor Day three times a day, while the winter schedule only offers bus service on weekends. The route is subject to interruption due to wind and severe inclement weather.[105]\n\n\n\n### Limited vehicle services[edit]\n\n\nThere are only six gas stations along Highway 1 in Big Sur, from Ragged Point in the south to Carmel Highlands in the north. Three of them are in the north near Big Sur Valley. The gas station at the Big Sur River Inn and Restaurant offers a steep discount to local residents.[106] The filling station in Gorda has one of the highest prices in the United States, as it is far from the electrical grid and part of the cost of auto fuel is used to support the operation of a diesel generator. All of them only operate during regular business hours and none of them supply diesel fuel. There are three Tesla recharging stations near Posts.[107][108][109][110]\n\n\n\n### Lack of restrooms[edit]\n\n\n\n> It's a 'scenic highway' with piles of shit up and down the highway.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aButch Kronlund, Coast Property Owners Association Executive Director\n> \n\n\nThere are only 16 public restrooms along the entire coast to accommodate the almost 5 million annual visitors. The number of visitors far exceeds the available restrooms, and most restrooms are not available in locations where tourists frequently visit.[111][112] Businesses report that the large number of visitors using their bathroom has overwhelmed their septic systems.[111]\n\n\nIf visitors can locate them, they can use bathrooms within California State Parks or federal campgrounds without paying an entrance fee.[113] But many of the bathrooms are not visible from Highway 1. This is due in part to the fact that restroom signs along Highway 1 were removed for aesthetic reasons.[111]\n\n\nAs a result, visitors often resort to defecating in the bushes near locations like the Bixby Creek Bridge.[111][112] Residents complain that visitors regularly defecate along Highway 1. Toilet paper, human waste, and trash litter the roadsides.[111] Residents have taken it upon themselves to clean up after visitors. The California Department of Transportation, which cleans the roadside areas about once a week, finds human waste during every cleanup.[112] Butch Kronlund, executive director of the Coast Property Owners Association, criticized the lack of restrooms. He says, \"It's a 'scenic highway' with piles of shit up and down the highway.\"[95][114]\n\n\nThe 1976 California Coastal Act makes installing public bathrooms, trash bins, or even new road signs along Highway 1 extremely difficult. Several federal, state, and local agencies have jurisdiction in Big Sur, all of which must weigh in on decisions affecting residents and visitors.[115]\n\n\n\n### Few visitors' services[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Deetjen's Big Sur Inn is listed on the National Register of Historic Places[116]\nThe land use restrictions that preserve Big Sur's natural beauty also mean that visitor accommodations are limited, often expensive, and places to stay fill up quickly during the busy summer season.\n\n\nThere are no urban areas, just three small clusters of restaurants, gas stations, motels, and camp grounds: Posts in the Big Sur River valley, Lucia, near Limekiln State Park, and Gorda, on the southern coast. Scattered among these distant settlements are nine small grocery stores, a few gift shops, and no chain hotels, supermarkets, or fast-food outlets, and no plans to add facilities or shopping.[117][118][119] Among the places to stay and eat are the luxury Ventana Inn, Post Ranch, and the Nepenthe restaurant, built around the cabin Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth impulsively bought.\n\n\n\n### Limited accommodations[edit]\n\n\n![A cabin is built attached to four trees about 10 feet above grade. An elevated walkway is connected to the cabin's entrance.](image)One of the accommodations at the Treebones campsite and resort in Big Sur\nThere are fewer than 300 hotel rooms on the entire 90-mile (140\u00a0km) stretch of Highway 1 between San Simeon and Carmel. Lodging include a few cabins, motels, and campgrounds, and higher-end resorts such as the Post Ranch Inn, charging as much as $1,800, and the Ventana Inn, with suites up to $2,400 per night.[120][121] There are some short-term rentals, but their legality is still being determined.[122]\n\n\n\n### Illegal camping[edit]\n\n\nSome social media sites report the availability of free camping on the side of roads, but camping of any sort or parking overnight along highways and local roads is illegal and violators are regularly cited. Sleeping in cars is illegal and subject to a $1000 fine.[62] Casual campers have at times turned every wide spot along the Nacimiento-Fergusson Road into an illegal campsite, although there are no bathrooms or fire pits. Residents complain about illegal camp fires and people defecating along the road without using proper sanitation.[98] Camping is only permitted within designated private and state or federal park campsites or within USFS lands.[123][124]\n\n\nOn July 22, 2016, an illegal campfire within Garrapata State Park, where camping is not permitted, got out of control. The resulting Soberanes Fire burned 132,127 acres (53,470\u00a0ha), 57 homes and 11 outbuildings, and killed a bulldozer operator. It took almost three months to extinguish and cost about $236\u00a0million to suppress.[125] In October, 2017, a visitor from Florida was arrested for starting an illegal campfire that grew out of control.[126]\n\n\n\n### Solutions under consideration[edit]\n\n\nThe Community Association of Big Sur (formerly the Big Sur Property Owners Association) is proposing some solutions. They want to close the parking lot at Bixby Creek for a year to encourage visitors to take public transportation. They are considering asking community volunteers to keep tourists from walking onto the bridge, which is both dangerous and illegal. Tourists who want to get to Pfeiffer Beach over the current mile-long, one-lane road to a small 65-car parking lot would be required to reserve and pay for parking ahead of time or take a shuttle. Parking on the highway shoulder at popular McWay Falls to avoid a $10 parking lot fee would be prohibited. Another idea under consideration is a ban on dispersed camping in the national forest during fire season \"until proper backcountry monitoring and enforcement exists.\" An illegal campfire in 2017 burned 57 homes and killed one firefighter. The Forest Service used to have several backcountry rangers but now has none.[115]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nThe arrival of Bay Area artists in Carmel-by-the-Sea beginning in 1904 was the beginning of a literary and artistic colony on the northern edge of Big Sur. Robinson Jeffers moved to Carmel in September 1914, and over his lifetime wrote many evocative poems about the isolation and natural beauty of Big Sur. Beginning in the 1920s, his poetry introduced the romantic idea of Big Sur's wild, untamed spaces to a national audience, which encouraged many of the later visitors.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Henry Miller Memorial Library. Author Henry Miller lived in Big Sur from 1944 to 1962.\nHenry Miller moved to Big Sur at the invitation of the Greco-French artist Jean Varda, uncle of filmmaker Agn\u00e8s Varda. He lived in Big Sur for almost 20 years, from 1944 to 1962. When he first arrived, he was broke and novelist Lynda Sargent was renting a cabin from a local riding club. She allowed Miller to live rent-free for a while. But when the cabin was sold to Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth in 1945, Miller moved several miles south to a wood cabin on Partington Ridge that had been owned by his friend Emil White.[127]\n\n\nWhile in Big Sur, Miller, avant-garde musician Harry Partch and Jean Varda were part of a local group of bohemians known as the Anderson Creek Gang, many of whom lived at the former highway work camp near the mouth of Anderson Creek. Miller lived in a shack there during 1946 before moving back to the cabin on Partington Ridge in 1947. In his 1957 essay/memoir/novel *Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch*, Miller described the joys and hardships that came from escaping the \"air-conditioned nightmare\" of modern life.[128]\n\n\n\n### Bohemian reputation[edit]\n\n\nHunter S. Thompson worked as a security guard and caretaker at a resort in Big Sur Hot Springs for eight months in 1961, just before the Esalen Institute was founded at that location. While there, he published his first feature story in the nationally distributed men's magazine *Rogue* about Big Sur's artisan and bohemian culture.[129][130] In the article, he described how the Bohemian image attracted people who annoyed residents:\n\n\n\n\n> Every weekend Dick Hartford, owner of the local Village Store, is plagued by people looking for \"sex orgies,\" \"wild drinking brawls,\" or \"the road to Henry Miller's house\" as if once they found Miller everything else would be taken care of ...\n> \n> \n> Time was when this place was as lonely and isolated as any spot in America. But no longer; inevitably, Big Sur has been \"discovered.\" *Life* called it a \"Rugged, Romantic World Apart,\" and presented nine pages of pictures to prove it. After that, there was no hope ...\n> \n> \n> \n> And on some weekends, it seems like all seven million of them are right here, bubbling over with questions: \"Where's the art colony man? I've come all the way from Tennessee to join it.\" \"Say, fella, where do I find this nudist colony?\"... Or the one that drove Miller half-crazy: \"Ah-ha! So you're Henry Miller! Well my name is Claude Fink and I've come to join the cult of sex and anarchy.\"[131]\n> \n> \n\n\nOther writers and artists were also attracted by Big Sur, including Edward Weston, Richard Brautigan, Emile Norman and Jack Kerouac.[132] Big Sur acquired a bohemian reputation with these newcomers. Kerouac followed Miller to Big Sur and included the rugged coast in large parts of two of his novels. He spent a few days in early 1960 at fellow poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti's cabin in Bixby Canyon and based his novel *Big Sur* on his time there.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:People from Big Sur, California\n\nWell-known individuals have called Big Sur home, including:\n\n\n\n* Jos\u00e9 Abrego merchant, politician\n* Ansel Adams photographer / musician\n* Juan Bautista Alvarado politician\n* Morley Baer photographer\n* Jos\u00e9 Castro politician, statesman, and military officer\n* John B.

At the turn of the 19th century, the 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) trip from Monterey to the Pfeiffer Ranch in the Big Sur valley could take three days by wagon. It was a rough road that ended in present-day Big Sur Village and could be impassible in winter.[133] There was no road beyond the Pfeiffer Ranch, only a horseback trail connecting the homesteads to the south. The ride from Pfeiffer Ranch to San Carp\u00f3foro canyon was about 60 miles (97\u00a0km) in a direct line, but about three times that by horseback. J. Smeaton Chase, who traveled on horseback up the coast in 1911, reported that a stagecoach carried passengers from Posts (then named Arbolado) to the Everett Hotel in Monterey on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.[134]\n\n\nThe highway was first proposed by Dr. John L.\u00a0D. Roberts, a physician who was summoned on April 21, 1894, to treat survivors of the wreck of the 493 tons (447\u00a0t; 440 long tons) S.S. *Los Angeles* (originally USRC *Wayanda*), which had run aground near the Point Sur Light Station about 25 miles (40\u00a0km) south of Carmel-by-the-Sea. The ride on his two-wheeled, horse-drawn cart took him 3+1\u20442 hours, a very fast trip for the day. Construction began in 1921, ceased for two years in 1926 when funding ran out, and after 18 years of construction, the Carmel\u2013San Simeon Highway was completed in 1937. The route was incorporated into the state highway system and re-designated as Highway 1 in 1939.\n\n\nThe highway is a dominant feature of the Big Sur coast, providing the primary means of access and transportation. The Big Sur portion of Highway 1 is generally considered to include the 71-mile (114\u00a0km) segment adjoining the unincorporated region of Big Sur between Malpaso Creek near Carmel Highlands[11] in the north and San Carp\u00f3foro Creek near San Simeon in the south.[12]\n\n\nAlong with the ocean views, this winding, narrow road, often cut into the face of seaside cliffs, dominates the visitor's experience of Big Sur.[135] The views, redwood forests, hiking, beaches, and other recreational opportunities have made Big Sur a destination for about 4.5 to 7 million people who live within a day's drive and for visitors from elsewhere in the world. [136]\n\n\nThe highway has been closed more than 55 times by landslides, and in May 2017, a 2,000,000-cubic-foot (57,000\u00a0m3) slide blocked the highway at Mud Creek, north of Salmon Creek near the San Luis Obispo County line, to just south of Gorda. The road was reopened on July 18, 2018, but is subject to closure during heavy storms.\n\n\n\n## Big Sur land use[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Big Sur land use\n\nThe policies protecting land used in Big Sur are some of the most restrictive local-use standards in California,[15] and are widely regarded as one of the most restrictive development protections anywhere.[16] The program protects viewsheds from the highway and many vantage points and severely restricts the density of development. About 60% of the coastal region is owned by governmental or private agencies which do not allow any development. The majority of the interior region is part of the Los Padres National Forest, Ventana Wilderness, Silver Peak Wilderness, or Fort Hunter Liggett. The area is protected by the Big Sur Local Coastal Plan, which preserves it as \"open space, a small residential community, and agricultural ranching.\"[14] Its intention is \"preserving the environment and visual access to it, the policies of the local coastal plan are to minimize, or limit, all destination activities.\"[137]\n\n\nThe unincorporated region encompassing Big Sur does not have specific boundaries, but is generally considered to include the 71-mile (114\u00a0km) segment of California State Route 1 between Malpaso Creek near Carmel Highlands[11] in the north and San Carp\u00f3foro Creek near San Simeon in the south,[12] as well as the entire Santa Lucia range between these creeks.[10] The interior region is mostly uninhabited, while the coast remains relatively isolated and sparsely populated, with between 1,800 and 2,000 year-round residents[13] and relatively few visitor accommodations scattered among the four small settlements.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Native Americans[edit]\n\n\nThree tribes of Native Americans\u00a0\u2014 the Ohlone, Esselen, and Salinan\u00a0\u2014 are the first known people to have inhabited the area. The Ohlone, also known as the Costanoans, is believed to have lived in the region from San Francisco to Point Sur. The Esselen lived in the area between Point Sur south to Big Creek and inland including the upper tributaries of the Carmel River and Arroyo Seco watersheds. The Salinan lived from Big Creek south to San Carp\u00f3foro Creek.[138]\n\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that the Esselen lived in Big Sur as early as 3500 BC, leading a nomadic, hunter-gatherer existence.[139][46] The aboriginal people inhabited fixed village locations, and followed food sources seasonally, living near the coast in winter to harvest rich stocks of otter, mussels, abalone, and other sea life. In the summer and fall, they traveled inland to gather acorns and hunt deer.[140] Middens attributed to the Essleen have been found as far south as Slates Hot Springs.\n\n\nThe native people hollowed mortar holes into large exposed rocks or boulders which they used to grind the acorns into flour. These can be found throughout the region. Arrows were made of cane and pointed with hardwood foreshafts.[140] The tribes also used controlled burning techniques to increase tree growth and food production.[10]:\u200a269\u2013270 The population was limited as the Santa Lucia Mountains made the area relatively inaccessible and long-term habitation a challenge. The population of the Esselen who lived in the Big Sur area are estimated from a few hundred to a thousand or more.[141][142]\n\n\nThe Salinan people are believed to have lived south of Junipero Serra Peak, perhaps ranging from Slates Hot Springs on the coast to Soledad in the Salinas Valley and into northern San Luis Obispo County. When European settlers arrived on the southern Big Sur coast in the 1860s, they found some native people living on Mill Creek south of the present-day Nacimiento-Fergusson Road. Mabel Plaskett, whose family homesteaded along the coast in September, 1869, wrote about two families who lived along the creek. Gabriel Fontes lived in a cave high up on the north slope of Mill Creek. He had two daughters, Alberta and Antonia. Alberta became a governess for a wealthy family and traveled to Europe several times. As of 1959[update], Tony lived in Jackson, California with family.[143][144]\n\n\nAnother native family was Cayatan and Lucia Canieti. She was the daughter of Antonio Gomez. They had two daughters, Hattie and Regina. They attended the Mansfield School in Manchester with the settlers' children.[144] Mortar holes attributed to the tribe are found at Wagon Caves northwest of Jolon, California.[143][145] Pre-contact population estimates range from 3,000 to 700.\n\n\n\n### Spanish exploration and settlement[edit]\n\n\nThe first Europeans to see Big Sur were Spanish mariners led by Juan Cabrillo in 1542, who sailed up the coast without landing. When Cabrillo sailed by, he described the coastal range as \"mountains which seem to reach the heavens, and the sea beats on them; sailing along close to land, it appears as though they would fall on the ships.\"[10]:\u200a272\n\n\nTwo centuries passed before the Spaniards attempted to colonize the area. On September 13, 1769, an expedition led by Gaspar de Portol\u00e1 were the first Europeans to enter the Big Sur region when they arrived at San Carp\u00f3foro Canyon near Ragged Point.[10]:\u200a272 While camping there, they were visited by six indigenous people who offered pinole and fish and received beads in exchange. They explored the coast ahead and concluded it was impassable. They were forced to turn inland up the steep arroyo. The march through the mountains was one of the most difficult portions of the expedition's journey. The Spanish were forced to \"make a road with crowbar and pickaxe\". Crespi wrote, \"The mountains which enclose it are perilously steep, and all are inaccessible, not only for men but also for goats and deer.\" From a high peak near the San Antonio River, they could see nothing but mountains in every direction.[28]:\u200a190 They reached Monterey on October 1. [12] [146][147] When they attempted to explore further south, the scouts found their way blocked by \"the same cliff that had forced us back from the shore and obliged us to travel through the mountains.\"[28]:\u200a205\n\n\nAfter the Spanish established the California missions in 1770, they baptized and forced the native population to labor at the missions. While living at the missions, the aboriginal population was exposed to diseases unknown to them, like smallpox and measles, for which they had no immunity, devastating the Native American population and their culture. Many of the remaining Native Americans assimilated with Spanish and Mexican ranchers in the nineteenth century.[10]:\u200a264\u2013267\n\n\nIn 1909, forest supervisors reported that three Indian families still lived within what was then known as the Monterey National Forest. The Encinale family of 16 members and the Quintana family with three members lived in the vicinity of The Indians (now known as Santa Lucia Memorial Park west of Ft. Hunger Liggett). The Mora family consisting of three members was living to the south along the Nacimiento-Ferguson Road.[148]\n\n\n\n### Spanish ranchos[edit]\n\n\nAlong with the rest of Alta California, Big Sur became part of Mexico when it gained independence from Spain in 1821. But, due to its inaccessibility, only a few small portions of the Big Sur region were included in land grants given by Mexican governors Jos\u00e9 Figueroa and Juan Bautista Alvarado.[96]:\u200a8\n\n\n\nRancho Tularcitos\nMain article: Rancho Tularcitos (Gom\u00e9z)\n\nRancho Tularcitos, 26,581-acre (10,757\u00a0ha) of land, was granted in 1834 by Governor Jos\u00e9 Figueroa to Rafael Gom\u00e9z.[149] It was located in upper Carmel Valley along Tularcitos Creek.[150]\n\n\n\nRancho San Francisquito\nMain article: Rancho San Francisquito (Munr\u00e1s)\n\nRancho San Francisquito was a 8,813-acre (35.66\u00a0km2) land grant given in 1835 by Governor Jos\u00e9 Castro to Catalina Manzanelli de Munr\u00e1s. She was the wife of Esteban Munr\u00e1s (1798\u20131850), a Monterey trader, amateur painter, and grantee of Rancho San Vicente.[151] The grant was located in the upper Carmel Valley, inland and east of Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito.[152]\n\n\n\nRancho Milpitas\nMain article: Rancho Milpitas (Pastor)\n\nRancho Milpitas was a 43,281-acre (17,515\u00a0ha) land grant given in 1838 by governor Juan Alvarado to Ygnacio Pastor.[151] The grant encompassed present-day Jolon and land to the west.[153] When Pastor obtained title from the Public Land Commission in 1875, Faxon Atherton immediately purchased the land. By 1880, the James Brown Cattle Company owned and operated Rancho Milpitas and neighboring Rancho Los Ojitos. William Randolph Hearst's Piedmont Land and Cattle Company acquired the rancho in 1925.[154] In 1940, in anticipation of the increased forces required in World War II, the U.S. War Department purchased the land from Hearst to create a troop training facility known as the Hunter Liggett Military Reservation.[155]\n\n\n\nRancho El Sur\nMain article: Rancho El Sur\n\nOn July 30, 1834, Figueroa granted Rancho El Sur, two square leagues of land totalling 8,949-acres (3,622\u00a0ha), to Juan Bautista Alvarado.[156]:\u200a21[157] The grant extended from the Little Sur River to what is now known as Cooper Point.[158][159] Alvarado later traded Rancho El Sur for the more accessible Rancho Bolsa del Potrero y Moro Cojo in the northern Salinas Valley, owned by his uncle by marriage, Captain John B. R. Cooper.[160] About one-half of Rancho El Sur is still an operating cattle ranch.\n\n\n\nRancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito\nMain article: Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito\n\nIn 1839, Alvarado granted Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito, also about two square leagues of land totalling 8,876-acre (3,592\u00a0ha), to Marcelino Escobar, a prominent official of Monterey.[161] The grant was bounded on the north by the Carmel River and on the south by Palo Colorado Canyon.[162]\n\n\nIn 1848, two days after the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill, Mexico ceded California to the United States as a result of the Mexican\u2013American War.\n\n\n\n### First survey[edit]\n\n\nDuring the first survey of the coast conducted by the U.S. Coast Survey in 1886, the surveyor reported:\n\n\n\n\n> The country between the shoreline and the Coast Range of mountains, running parallel with the shoreline from San Carpojoro to Point Sur is probably the roughest piece of coastline on the whole Pacific coast of the United States from San Diego to Cape Flattery.\n> \n> \n> The highest peaks of the crest of the coast range are located at an average distance from the coast of three and a half miles [5.6\u00a0km]. In this distance they rise to elevations of from three thousand six hundred to five thousand feet [1,100 to 1,500\u00a0m] above the sea-level. From San Carpoforo Creek to Pfeiffer's Point, a distance of 54 miles (87\u00a0km), the shore-line is iron-bound coast with no possible chance of getting from the hills to the shore-line and back except at the mouths of the creeks and at such places as Coxe's Hole and Slate's Hot Springs, where there are short stretches of sandy and rocky beaches from fifty to one hundred yards [meters] in length. In many places the sea bluffs are perpendicular, and rise from one thousand to one thousand five hundred feet [300 to 460\u00a0m] above the sea. The country is cut up by deep ca\u00f1ons [canyons], walled in with high and precipitous bluffs. These ca\u00f1ons are densely wooded with redwood, oak, and yellow and silver pine timber.\n> \n> \n> \n> The redwood trees are from three to six feet [0.91 to 1.83\u00a0m] in diameter and from one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet high [30 to 46\u00a0m]. The oaks and pines are of the same average dimensions. Beautiful streams of clear cold water, filled with an abundance of salmon or trout, are to be found in all the canyons. The spurs running from the summits of the range to the ocean bluffs are covered with a dense growth of brush and scattering clumps of oak and pine timber. The chaparral is very thick, and in many places grows to a height of ten or fifteen feet [3\u20135 m]\u00a0... The spurs, slopes, and canons are impenetrable\u00a0...[163][164]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Homesteaders[edit]\n\n\nThe first known European settler in Big Sur was John Davis who in 1853 built a cabin near the present-day site of the Mount Manuel Trail trailhead.[10]:\u200a326 In 1868, Native Americans Manual and Florence Innocenti bought Davis' cabin and land for $50.\n\n\nJohn Bautista Rogers Cooper, born John Rogers Cooper, was a Yankee from the British Channel Islands who arrived in Monterey in 1823.[165] He became a Mexican citizen, converted to Catholicism, and was given a Spanish name at his baptism. He married Native American Encarnacion Vallejo and acquired considerable land, including Rancho El Sur, on which he had a cabin built in April or May 1861.[166] The Cooper Cabin is the oldest surviving structure in Big Sur.[167]\n\n\n\n![](image)Joseph W. Post House, a historic structure built in 1867\u20131877.\nWilliam B. Post arrived in California in 1848 and was the foreman of the Soberanes Ranch when he built a single-room cabin in 1867. His son added to it in 1877, when the family moved there full-time. The Post House is a historic landmark and is on the grounds of the Ventana Inn resort.\n\n\nMichael Pfeiffer, his wife, and four children arrived in Big Sur in 1869 to settle on the south coast. After reaching Sycamore Canyon, they found it to their liking and decided to stay.[10]:\u200a326 He filed a land patent on January 20, 1883, claiming two sections of land he already resided on near and immediately north of the mouth of Sycamore Canyon.[168] They had six more children later on.\n\n\nAnother important pioneer-era historic resource is the Swetnam / Trotter House, a late 19th-century dwelling located at the mouth of Palo Colorado Canyon.\n\n\n\n![A shingled log cabin alongside a split rail fence is the oldest structure on the Big Sur coast.](image)The Cooper Cabin is the oldest structure on the Big Sur coast, built in 1861 for Captain J.B.R. Cooper\nAfter the passage of the federal Homestead Act in 1862, a few hardy settlers were drawn by the promise of free 160-acre (65\u00a0 ha) parcels. After the claimant filed for the land, they had gained full ownership after five years of residence or by paying $1.50 per acre within six months.[169] Each claim was for 160 acres, a quarter section of free government land.[148]\n\n\nOther settlers included William F. Notley, who homesteaded at the mouth of Palo Colorado Canyon in 1891. He began harvesting tanoak bark from the canyon, a lucrative source of income at the time. Notley's Landing is named after him. Isaac Swetnam worked for Notley and built a house at the mouth of Palo Colorado Canyon, which as of 2018[update] is still a residence. Sam Trotter, who also worked for Notley, later bought Swetnam's house. He married Adelaide Pfeiffer, the daughter of Micheal Pfeiffer, and they raised a family there from 1906 to 1923.\n\n\nWilliam and Sarah (Barnes) Plaskett and their family settled in Pacific Valley in 1869. They built several homes and a saw mill.[170]:\u200a38 Homesteader John Junge built a one-room redwood cabin in 1920.[171] The John Little State Natural Reserve straddling the mouth of Lime Creek preserves the original 1917 cabin of conservationist Elizabeth K. Livermore.[172]\n\n\nMany other local sites retain names from settlers during this period: Bottcher, Cooper's Point, Gamboa, Anderson, Partington, Dani, Harlans, McQuades, Ross, and McWay are a few of the place names.[171] Wilber Harlan, a native of Indiana, homesteaded near Lucia in 1885. His family descendants are as of 2017[update] still operating the Lucia Lodge.[171][173]\n\n\n\n### Industrial era and gold rush[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A major forest product of the Big Sur coast was the bark of Tanbark Oak\n![](image)Bixby Landing in 1911 was used to transport products to and from ships offshore\nThe local industries provided more work and supported a larger population than it does today. Jobs included harvesting lumber and tanoak bark, gold mining, and limestone processing.\n\n\nFrom the 1860s through the start of the twentieth century, lumbermen cut down most of the readily accessible coast redwoods. Redwood harvesting further inland was always limited by the rugged terrain and difficulty in transporting the lumber to market. Redwood was cut in large amounts for use onsite in limestone kilns. Two companies operated large-scale limestone extraction and processing. The Monterey Lime Company operated near Long Ridge, east of Bixby Creek, and the Rockland Lime and Lumber Company operated a kiln at what later became known Limekiln Creek in the south.[174]\n\n\nWilliam F. Notley was one of the first to harvest the bark of the Tanbark Oak from the Little Sur River canyon.[175] Tanbark was used to manufacture tannic acid, necessary to the growing leather tanning industry located in Santa Cruz, and to preserve fish nets.[176] The tanbark was harvested from the isolated trees inland, left to dry, corded, and brought out on mules or hauled out on \"go-devils\". The go-devil was a wagon with two wheels on the front, while the rear had rails for pulling. A point on the Palo Colorado road is still nicknamed \"The Hoist\" because of the very steep road which required wagon-loads of tanbark and lumber to be hoisted by block and tackle hitched to oxen.[177] The old block and tackle on a beam is still mounted between mailboxes.[178]\n\n\nThe 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) trip from Monterey to the Pfeiffer Ranch usually took all day by wagon. If the road was in bad shape, the stage driver only took a lightweight spring wagon. The rough road ended at the Pfeiffer Resort on the Big Sur River. It could be impassible in winter. Notley constructed a dog-hole port at the mouth of the Palo Colorado River, and a small village grew up from 1898 to 1907 around at what is known today as Notley's Landing.[179][180] Bixby built a sawmill on his property, and to get the lumber and lime to market, built a similar doghole port at the mouth of what was then known as Mill's Creek, today as Bixby Creek.[174] The tanbark was loaded by cable and a chute onto waiting vessels anchored offshore. In 1889, as much as 50,000 cords of tanbark were hauled out from the Little Sur River and Big Sur River watersheds.[10]:\u200a330 A cable hoist and chute were used to move goods to and from schooners anchored just offshore.[133]Near the start of the 20th century, the tan oak trees were becoming seriously depleted, which slowly led to the demise of the industries they had created.[175] Only the foundations of the doghole ports remain today.[95]\n\n\nIn the 1880s, gold was found in the Los Burros District at Alder Creek in the mountains east of present-day Gorda. The gold rush town of Manchester at 35\u00b052\u203248\u2033N 121\u00b023\u203231\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff35.880\u00b0N 121.392\u00b0W\ufeff / 35.880; -121.392 existed for a few short years.[181][182][183] The town boasted a population of 200, four stores, a restaurant, five saloons, a dance hall, and a hotel, but it was abandoned soon after the start of the twentieth century and burned to the ground in 1909.[19][184] Miners extracted about $150,000 in gold (about $5.49\u00a0million in 2023) during the mine's existence.[170]:\u200a30\n\n\nResidents also received supplies by steamship that would make a trip once a year in the fall from San Francisco to Big Sur to drop off supplies that could not be transported by wagon.[95] In 1894, ranch owners Post, Pfeiffer, and Castro hired the Pacific Coast Steamship Company's 180 feet (55\u00a0m) steamer *Bonita* to bring lumber and seed oats to the mouth of the Big Sur River and Big Creek, north of Lucia.[185] Lightering was used to transport freight to and from the beach. A large crowd gathered to receive supplies from and to load butter, honey, beans, wool, hides, and other products onto the ship.[186]\n\n\nIn the late 1800s, the Ventana Power Company operated a sawmill near present-day Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. They began planning to build a dam on the Big Sur River just downstream of the confluence of Ventana Creek and the Big Sur River. They hoped to sell the electricity to the City of Monterey. They built a diversion channel along the Big Sur River, but the 1906 San Francisco earthquake bankrupted the company and they abandoned the project. The stonework from the diversion channel is still visible.[187] Few other signs of this brief industrial period are visible. The rugged, isolated terrain kept out all but the sturdiest and most self-sufficient settlers. Travelers who ventured south of the Post Ranch rode horseback along trails that connected the various homesteaders along the coast.[46]\n\n\nThe 1900 Monterey County voting register indicates 61 male voters in the Big Sur area. The majority (47) were either farmers or ranchers. Other trades included a gardener, apiarist, fruit grower, woodsman, laborer, lighthouse keeper, blacksmith, surveyor, miner, and teamster. Lumber-related occupations include bark peelers, woodchoppers, and wood overseers.[174]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Santa Lucia Range\n\nThe Santa Lucia Mountain Range, which dominates the Big Sur region, is 140 miles (230\u00a0km) long, extending from Carmel in the north to the Cuyama River in San Luis Obispo County. The range is never more than 11 miles (18\u00a0km) from the coast.[20]:\u200a11\n\n\nThe Santa Lucia Mountains are characterized by extremely steep slopes, all associated with watersheds flowing directly or indirectly into the Pacific Ocean. The range forms the steepest coastal slope in the contiguous United States.[20]:\u200a12 The mountains are of recent tectonic origin, and its rugged, steep, and dissected deep stream canyons. The general trend of the range is northwest-southeast, paralleling the numerous faults that transect the area.[188]\n\n\nThe topography is complex, however, reflecting active uplift and deformation, a variety of lithological types, rapidly incising stream networks, and highly unstable slopes. Stream channels and hill slopes are very steep, with average hill slope gradients exceeding 60% in some interior watersheds. The coastal side of the range rises directly from the shoreline, with oceanfront ridges rising directly 4,000 to 5,000 feet (1,200 to 1,500\u00a0m) to the crest of the coastal range. Big Sur's Cone Peak, at an elevation of 5,155 feet (1,571\u00a0m), is only 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) from the ocean and is the tallest coastal mountain in the contiguous United States.[189][10]\n\n\nThe basement rocks of the Santa Lucia Range contain Mesozoic Franciscan and Salinian Block rocks.[188] The Franciscan complex is composed of greywacke sandstone and greenstone, with serpentinite bodies and other Ultramafic rocks present. Small areas of marble and limestone lenses form resistant outcrops that are prominent landscape features, often white to light gray. The Salinian block is made up of highly fractured, and deeply weathered meta-sediments, especially biotite schist and gneiss, intruded by plutonic (granitic) rocks such as quartz diorite and granodiorite. Both formations have been disrupted and tectonically slivered by motion on the San Andreas and associated fault systems. The Palo Colorado and Church Creek faults are prominent features influencing the linear northwest-southeast alignment of primary drainages.[188]\n\n\n\n### Marine influence[edit]\n\n\nAlong with much of the central and northern California coast, Big Sur frequently has dense fog in summer. Fog and lack of precipitation during the summer both result from the North Pacific High's presence offshore during that season. The high-pressure cell inhibits rainfall and generates northwesterly airflow. These prevailing summer winds from the northwest drive the ocean surface water slightly offshore (through the Ekman effect) which generates an upwelling of colder subsurface water. Warm surface air blowing over cold upwelling ocean water close to the coast is cooled to create a surface-based inversion.[10]:\u200a33\u201335 Summer fog is common below about 2,000 feet (610\u00a0m) elevation. During 2014 and 2015, researchers recorded summer seasonal totals of 125 centimetres (49\u00a0in) and 31 centimetres (12\u00a0in) of fog water drip under open shrub canopies. They concluded that precipitation from fog dripping into the soils under coastal shrub canopies can be as much as 50% of annual average rainfall rates.[190] The fog usually moves out to sea during the day and closes in at night, but sometimes heavy fog blankets the coast all day.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Wildfires[edit]\n\n\n### Historic fires[edit]\n\n\nFire plays a key role in the ecology of the upper slopes of the Big Sur region's mountains where chaparral dominates the landscape.[191] It is known that Native Americans burned chaparral to increase food production and promote grasslands for textiles, but little is known about the natural frequency of fire in the Santa Lucia Mountains.[10]:\u200a269\u2013270[192] A study of fire scars on sugar pines on Junipero Serra Peak found that at least six fires had burned the region between 1790 and 1901.[193] During the Spanish and Mexican era the Native Americans set fires regularly in coastal and valley grasslands to control brush growth and reduce fire risk.[193] The European homesteaders followed that tradition and set controlled burns every winter when conditions were right.[194]\n\n\n\n![](image)FEMA team assesses wildfire damage after the Basin Fire, 2008\nFollowing the depopulation of the Native Americans from the region in the late 1800s, there have been several very large fires in the Big Sur area. In 1894, a fire burned for weeks through the upper watersheds of all of the major streams in the Big Sur region. Another large fire in 1898 burned without any effort by the few residents to put it out, except to save their buildings.[195] In 1903, a fire started by an untended campfire near Chews Ridge burned a path 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) wide to the coast over three months. In 1906, a fire that began in Palo Colorado Canyon from the embers of a campfire burned 150,000 acres (61,000\u00a0ha) over 35 days and was finally extinguished by the first rainfall of the season.[196] The number of fires declined when the U.S. Forest Service began managing the land in 1907.[193]\n\n\n\n### Modern wildfires[edit]\n\n\nIn recent history, the area was struck by the Molera Fire in 1972, which resulted in flooding and mud flows in the Big Sur River valley that buried portions of several buildings the following winter.[197] The area was burned by Marble Cone Fire in 1977, the Rat Creek Gorda Complex Fire in 1985, the Kirk Complex Fire in 1999, the Basin Complex Fire in 2008, the Pfeiffer Fire in December 2013, and the Soberanes Fire in 2016.[198]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 2016 Soberanes fire tops a ridge covered in fire retardant adjacent to the Pacific Ocean\nThe Basin Complex Fire forced an eight-day evacuation of Big Sur and the closure of Highway 1, beginning just before the July 4, 2008 holiday weekend.[199] The fire, which burned over 130,000 acres (53,000\u00a0ha), represented the largest of many lightning-caused wildfires that had broken out throughout California during the same period.[200] Although the fire caused no loss of life, it destroyed 27 homes, and the tourist-dependent economy lost about a third of its expected summer revenue.[201][202] The Pfeiffer Fire from December 17 to 20, 2013 burned 917 acres (371\u00a0ha)and destroyed 34 homes in an area near Pfeiffer Ridge Road and Sycamore Canyon Road.[203]\n\n\nThe July 2016 Soberanes Fire was caused by unknown individuals who started and lost control of an illegal campfire in the Garrapata Creek watershed. After it burned 57 homes in the Garrapata and Palo Colorado Canyon areas, firefighters were able to build lines around parts of the Big Sur community. A bulldozer operator was killed when his equipment overturned during night operations in Palo Colorado Canyon.\n\n\nCoast residents east of Highway 1 were required to evacuate for short periods, and Highway 1 was shut down at intervals over several days to allow firefighters to conduct backfire operations. Visitors avoided the area and tourism revenue was impacted for several weeks.[204]\n\n\nIn April, 2022, Ivan Gomez was convicted of 16 felony counts including arson for purposefully starting a fire near Lime Creek on August 18, 2020. The Dolan Fire killed a dozen Critically Endangered California Condors when it burned through the 80 acres (32\u00a0ha) Big Sur Condor Sanctuary operated by the Ventana Wildlife Society of Monterey. The 125,000 acres (51,000\u00a0ha) fire was not fully contained until December 31, more than four months after it started.[205]\n\n\n\n### Effect on Redwoods[edit]\n\n\nIn the lower elevations and canyons, the California Redwood is often found. Its thick bark, along with foliage that starts high above the ground, protect the species from both fire and insect damage, contributing to the coast redwood's longevity.[206] Fire appears to benefit redwoods by removing competitive species. A 2010 study compared post-wildfire survival and regeneration of redwood and associated species. It concluded that fires of all severity increase the relative abundance of redwood and higher-severity fires provide the greatest benefit.[207]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Upper image from March and lower image from October, showing a typical fog bank nearly 1,000\u00a0feet\u00a0(300\u00a0m) thick. Also illustrating the difference in vegetation between the winter rainy season and dry early fall.\nBig Sur typically enjoys a mild Mediterranean climate, with a sunny, dry summer and fall, and cool, wet winter. Coastal temperatures range from the 50s at night to the 70s by day (Fahrenheit) from June through October, and in the 40s to 60s from November through May. Further inland, away from the ocean's moderating influence, temperatures are much more variable. The weather varies widely due to the influence of the jagged topography, creating many microclimates.\n\n\n\n![](image)Big Sur Coast in April 1969 after a wet winter\nThe record maximum temperature was 111\u00a0\u00b0F (43.9\u00a0\u00b0C) on September 7, 2020, and the record low was 26\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22123.3\u00a0\u00b0C), recorded on February 9, 2009.\n\n\nDuring the winter, Big Sur experiences some of the heaviest rainfall in California.[208] More than 70 percent of the rain falls from December through March. The summer is generally dry. The Santa Lucia range rises to more than 5,800\u00a0 ft (1760 m), and the amount of rainfall greatly increases as the elevation rises and cools the air, but rainfall amounts decrease sharply in the rain shadow of the coastal mountains. Scientists estimate that about 90 in. (230\u00a0 cm) falls on average near the ridge tops. But actual totals vary considerably.[10] Snowfall is rare on the coast, but is common in the winter months on the higher ridges of the Santa Lucia Range.[209]\n\n\nMonterey County maintains a remote rain gauge for flood prediction on Mining Ridge at 4,000\u00a0ft (1200 m) about 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) north-east of Cone Peak. The gauge frequently receives more rain than any gauge in the Monterey and San Francisco Bay Areas. The wettest winter season was 1982\u20131983, when it rained more than 178 in. (452\u00a0cm) but the total is unknown because the rain gauge failed at that point. The wettest calendar year on record was 1982-83, when it rained 88.85 inches (2,257\u00a0mm).[10][210]\n\n\nThe month with the greatest rain fall total was December 1955 when it rained a record 27.21 inches (691\u00a0mm). At Pfeiffer\u2013Big Sur State Park on the coast, rainfall averaged about 43 in. (109\u00a0cm) annually from 1914 to 1987. In 1975\u20131976, it rained only 15 in. (39\u00a0cm) at the park, compared to 85 in. (216\u00a0cm) in 1982\u20131983.[10]\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Big Sur, California (1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1993\u2013present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 81(27)\n | 85(29)\n | 88(31)\n | 98(37)\n | 96(36)\n | 102(39)\n | 103(39)\n | 101(38)\n | 111(44)\n | 102(39)\n | 90(32)\n | 78(26)\n | 111(44)\n |\n| Mean maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 73.1(22.8)\n | 74.1(23.4)\n | 78.2(25.7)\n | 83.9(28.8)\n | 85.9(29.9)\n | 90.0(32.2)\n | 90.5(32.5)\n | 92.1(33.4)\n | 93.3(34.1)\n | 90.1(32.3)\n | 79.6(26.4)\n | 69.8(21.0)\n | 98.4(36.9)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 60.5(15.8)\n | 61.1(16.2)\n | 64.2(17.9)\n | 67.3(19.6)\n | 70.5(21.4)\n | 74.2(23.4)\n | 75.4(24.1)\n | 77.4(25.2)\n | 76.8(24.9)\n | 73.5(23.1)\n | 65.3(18.5)\n | 59.3(15.2)\n | 68.8(20.4)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 51.4(10.8)\n | 51.9(11.1)\n | 53.7(12.1)\n | 55.4(13.0)\n | 58.0(14.4)\n | 61.1(16.2)\n | 63.0(17.2)\n | 63.8(17.7)\n | 63.5(17.5)\n | 61.0(16.1)\n | 55.3(12.9)\n | 50.9(10.5)\n | 57.4(14.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 42.4(5.8)\n | 42.8(6.0)\n | 43.3(6.3)\n | 43.5(6.4)\n | 45.5(7.5)\n | 48.0(8.9)\n | 50.5(10.3)\n | 50.1(10.1)\n | 50.1(10.1)\n | 48.5(9.2)\n | 45.4(7.4)\n | 42.5(5.8)\n | 46.1(7.8)\n |\n| Mean minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 33.8(1.0)\n | 34.0(1.1)\n | 34.8(1.6)\n | 35.3(1.8)\n | 39.0(3.9)\n | 41.1(5.1)\n | 43.7(6.5)\n | 43.9(6.6)\n | 42.5(5.8)\n | 39.8(4.3)\n | 36.7(2.6)\n | 33.8(1.0)\n | 30.1(\u22121.1)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 27(\u22123)\n | 26(\u22123)\n | 27(\u22123)\n | 28(\u22122)\n | 35(2)\n | 37(3)\n | 41(5)\n | 40(4)\n | 39(4)\n | 31(\u22121)\n | 28(\u22122)\n | 27(\u22123)\n | 26(\u22123)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 9.48(241)\n | 8.59(218)\n | 6.72(171)\n | 2.94(75)\n | 1.15(29)\n | 0.20(5.1)\n | 0.06(1.5)\n | 0.05(1.3)\n | 0.13(3.3)\n | 1.88(48)\n | 4.16(106)\n | 9.18(233)\n | 44.54(1,131)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.01 in) | 10.7\n | 11.2\n | 10.2\n | 6.3\n | 3.7\n | 0.8\n | 0.3\n | 0.4\n | 0.7\n | 3.0\n | 6.9\n | 10.6\n | 64.8\n |\n| Source: NOAA[211][212] |\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nSee also: California montane chaparral and woodlands\n\n![](image)Big Sur coast looking south near Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park\nThe many climates of Big Sur result in great biodiversity, including many rare and endangered species such as the wild orchid *Piperia yadonii*, which is found only on the Monterey Peninsula and on Rocky Ridge in the Los Padres forest. Arid, dusty chaparral-covered hills exist within easy walking distance of lush riparian woodland. Fort Hunter-Liggett is host to about one-fourth of all Tule elk found in California and provides roosting places for bald eagles and endangered condors. It also is home to some of the healthiest stands of the live valley and blue oaks.[213]\n\n\n\n### Southern limit of redwood trees[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sequoia sempervirens\n\nThe high coastal mountains trap moisture from the clouds: fog in summer, rain, and snow in winter creating a favorable environment for the coast redwood (*Sequoia sempervirens*) trees found in the Big Sur region. They are found near the ocean in canyon bottoms or inland canyons alongside creeks and in other areas that meet its requirements for cooler temperatures and moisture. Due to drier conditions, trees in the Big Sur region only grow about 200 feet (61\u00a0m) tall, smaller than specimens found to the north.[214]\n\n\nThe redwood trees in Big Sur are the remnant of much larger groves. Many old-growth trees were cut by the Ventana Power Company which operated a sawmill near present-day Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park from the late 1800s through 1906 when its operations were bankrupted by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. When John and Florence Pfeiffer opened Pffeifer's Ranch Resort in 1910, they built guest cabins from lumber cut using the mill. The mill was resurrected when Highway 1 was constructed during the 1920s. It supplied lumber for housing built for workers.[215][216]\n\n\nWhile many trees were harvested, several inaccessible locations were never logged. A large grove of trees is found along the north fork of the Little Sur River. William Randolph Hearst was interested in preserving the uncut redwood forest, and on November 18, 1921, he purchased about 1,445 acres (585\u00a0ha) from the Eberhard and Kron Tanning Company of Santa Cruz for about $50,000. He later donated the land to the Monterey Bay Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, who completed the construction of Camp Pico Blanco in 1954.[217]\n\n\nIn 2008, scientist J. Michael Fay published a map of the old growth redwoods based on his transect of the entire redwood range.[218] The southernmost naturally occurring grove of redwoods is found within the Big Sur region in the Southern Redwood Botanical Area, a 17 acres (6.9\u00a0ha) reserve located in the Little Redwood Gulch watershed adjacent to the Silver Peak Wilderness. It is just north of the Salmon Creek trailhead.[214][219] The southernmost tree is about 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m) from Highway 1 at the approximate coordinates 35\u00b049\u203242\u2033N 121\u00b023\u203214\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff35.82833\u00b0N 121.38722\u00b0W\ufeff / 35.82833; -121.38722\n\n\n\n### Plant species[edit]\n\n\nThe rare Santa Lucia fir (*Abies bracteata*) is found only in the Santa Lucia mountains. A common \"foreign\" species is the Monterey pine (*Pinus radiata*), which was uncommon in Big Sur until the late nineteenth century, though its major native habitat is only a few miles upwind on the Monterey Peninsula when many homeowners began to plant the quick-growing tree as a windbreak. There are many broadleaved trees as well, such as the tanoak (*Lithocarpus densiflorus*), coast live oak (*Quercus agrifolia*), and California bay laurel (*Umbellularia californica*). In the rain shadow, the forests disappear and the vegetation becomes open oak woodland, then transitions into the more familiar fire-tolerant California chaparral scrub.\n\n\n\n### Wildlife[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A harbor seal on a Big Sur beach\nThe Big Sur River watershed provides habitat for mountain lion, deer, fox, coyotes, and non-native wild boars. The boars, of Russian stock, were introduced in the 1920s by George Gordon Moore, the owner of Rancho San Carlos.[220] Because most of the upper reaches of the Big Sur River watershed are within the Los Padres National Forest and the Ventana Wilderness, much of the river is in pristine condition.\n\n\n\nFormer Grizzly bear range\nMain article: California grizzly bear\n\nThe region was historically populated by California grizzly bears. During the Spanish period of California history, the Spaniards rarely entered the area, except to capture runaway Mission Indians or to hunt grizzly bears that ate their livestock. The Mexican settlers captured bears for Monterey's bear and bull fights and they also sold their skins for 6 to 10 pesos to trading ships that visited Monterey. Bear Trap Canyon near Bixby Creek was one of their favorite sites for trapping grizzly bears.[221][222]\n\n\nThe California grizzly bear (Ursus arctos californicus) was heavier and larger than grizzly bears found elsewhere in the continental United States. Malcolm Margolin in *The Ohlone Way* wrote that \"These enormous bears were everywhere, feeding on berries, lumbering along the beaches, congregating beneath oak trees during acorn season, and stationed along nearly every stream and creek during the annual runs of salmon and steelhead.\" Grizzly bears presented a serious threat to human beings armed with only a bow and arrows and the Native Americans used to avoid them whenever possible.[223]\n\n\n*The Monterey Herald* noted on July 4, 1874:\n\n\n\n\n> Last Monday, Captain A. Smith, who resides about ten miles from town, in the Carmel Valley, succeeded in poisoning a large grizzly bear. Bruin had been annoying the neighborhood by destroying cattle, etc., for several years past, and all efforts to exterminate him seem futile. In some manner, however, he was induced to partake of that \u201ccold pizen\u201d the captain had prepared for his special benefit. He is not likely to repeat his experiment.[223]\n> \n> \n\n\nThere are remnants of a grizzly bear trap within Palo Corona Regional Park east of Point Lobos in a grove of redwood trees next to a creek.[224]\n\n\nEuropean settlers paid bounties on the bears who regularly preyed on livestock until the early 20th century.[19]:\u200a4 Absolom (Rocky) Beasley hunted grizzly bears throughout the Santa Lucia Range and claimed to have killed 139 bears in his lifetime.[225] The Pfeiffer family would fill a bait ball of swine entrails with strychnine and hang it from a tree. They wrote that the last grizzly bear was seen in Monterey County in 1941 on the Cooper Ranch near the mouth of the Little Sur River.[226] :\u200a21 Other sources report that last California grizzly was seen in 1924.[224][227]\n\n\nSince about 1980, American black bears have been sighted in the area, likely expanding their range from southern California and filling in the ecological niche left when the grizzly bear was exterminated.[10]:\u200a261\n\n\n\nSteelhead\nMain article: Rainbow trout\n\nThe California Department of Fish and Game says the Little Sur River is the \"most important spawning stream for Steelhead\" distinct population segment on the Central Coast, where the fish is listed as threatened.[228] and that it \"is one of the best steelhead streams in the county.\"[229]:\u200a166 The Big Sur River is also a key habitat for the steelhead.[230][231]\n\n\nA US fisheries service report estimates that the number of trout in the entire south-central coast area\u2014including the Pajaro River, Salinas River, Carmel River, Big Sur River, and Little Sur River\u2014have dwindled from about 4,750 fish in 1965 to about 800 in 2005.[232]\n\n\nNumerous fauna are found in the Big Sur region. Among amphibians the California giant salamander (*Dicamptodon ensatus*) is found here, which point marks the southern extent of its range.[233]\n\n\n\nCalifornia condor\nMain article: California condor\n\nThe California condor (*Gymnogyps californianus*) is a critically endangered species that was near extinction when the remaining wild birds were captured. A captive breeding program was begun in 1987. The Ventana Wildlife Society acquired 80 acres near Anderson Canyon that it used for a captive breeding program.[234] After some success, a few birds were released in 1991 and 1992 in Big Sur, and again in 1996 in Arizona near the Grand Canyon.[235]\n\n\nIn 1997, the Ventana Wildlife Society began releasing captive-bred California Condors in Big Sur. The birds take six years to mature before they can produce offspring, and a nest was discovered in a redwood tree in 2006.[236][237] This was the first time in more than 100 years in which a pair of California condors had been seen nesting in Northern California.[238] The repopulation effort has been successful in part because a significant portion of the birds' diet includes carcasses of large sea creatures that have washed ashore, which are unlikely to be contaminated with lead, the principal cause of the bird's mortality.[239]\n\n\nAs of July 2014[update], the Ventana Wildlife Society managed 34 free-flying condors.[240] There were part of a total population of 437 condors spread over California, Baja California and Arizona, of which 232 are wild birds and 205 are in captivity.[241]\n\n\n\n### Marine protected areas[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Coast view of the Big Creek State Marine Reserve\nThe off-shore region of the Big Sur Coast is protected by the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Within that sanctuary are other conservation areas and parks. The onshore topography that drops abruptly into the Pacific continues offshore where a narrow continental shelf drops to the continental slope in only a few miles. The ocean reaches a depth of more than 12,000 feet (3,700\u00a0m) just 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) offshore. Two deep submarine canyons cut into the shelf near the Big Sur coast: the Sur Submarine Canyon, reaching a depth of 3,000\u00a0ft (910\u00a0m) just 8\u00a0mi (13\u00a0km) south of Point Sur, and Partington Submarine Canyon, which reaches a similar depth of 6.8\u00a0mi (10.9\u00a0km) offshore of Grimes Canyon.[10]\n\n\nLike underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.\n\n\n\n* Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary\n* Point Lobos State Marine Reserve\n* Point Sur State Marine Reserve and Marine Conservation Area\n* Big Creek State Marine Reserve and Marine Conservation Area\n* Salmon Creek State Area of Special Biological Significance\n* California Sea Otter Game Refuge\n* Julia Pfeiffer Burns Underwater Park\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park after fire\nBig Sur is sparsely populated. There are about 1,800 to 2,000 year-round residents, only a few hundred more residents than found there in 1900.[30] Big Sur residents include descendants of the original ranching families, artists, writers, service staff, along with homeowners. The mountainous terrain, restrictions imposed by the Big Sur Coastal Use Plan,[242] limited availability of property than can be developed, and the expense required to build on available land has kept Big Sur relatively undeveloped. According to the Big Sur Chamber of Commerce, about half the businesses derive their income from the hospitality industry, and they in turn produce about 90 percent of the local economy.[243]\n\n\n\n### Population data[edit]\n\n\nThe United States does not define a census-designated place called Big Sur, but it does define a census tract (115) that includes almost all of the Big Sur coast, beginning in the north at Malpaso Creek and ending south of Lucia. It doesn't include New Camoldi Hermitage, Gorda, and Ragged Point where a few dozen people live, and it doesn't include the isolated private inholdings within the Los Padres National Forest. It includes much of the interior coast as far west as the Tassajara Zen Center.\n\n\nIn 1977, there were 1,813 residents and 846 dwelling units.[244] In 2018, the Census Bureau estimated there were 1,728 residents, (1,125 white, 525 Latino or Hispanic), 892 housing units, 639 households, 253 vacant or rental housing units; the median value of owner-occupied housing units was $877,100. Per capita income was $34,845; median income $63,843; mean income $81,766.[245]\n\n\nThe racial makeup of this area was 87.6% White, 1.1% African American, 1.3% Native American, 2.4% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 5.5% from other races, and 3.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race was 9.6% of the population. In the 93920 ZCTA, the population age was widely distributed, with 20.2% under the age of 20, 4.5% from 20 to 24, 26.9% from 25 to 44, 37.0% from 45 to 64, and 11.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43.2 years. The median income in 2000 for a household in 93920 ZCTA was $41,304, and the median income for a family was $65,083.[246]\n\n\n\n## Fire protection[edit]\n\n\nTwo local volunteer fire departments provide emergency services in the region. CalFire's nearest station is located in Carmel 33 miles (53\u00a0km) north of Big Sur Village. The United States Forest Service's Nacimiento Ranger Station is located on Nacimiento-Fergusson Road 7 miles (11\u00a0km) from the coast highway.[247][86] It was destroyed by the arson-set Dolan Fire on September 8, 2020 and is to be rebuilt.[248]\n\n\nDuring winter storms following the 2020 Dolan Fire, entire sections of the Nacimiento-Fergusson Road were washed away, and it has remained closed since then. In January 2022, U.S. Representative Jimmy Panetta announced that he had obtained $126 million in Federal Highway Administration funds to repair the road and rebuild the USFS Nacimiento Ranger Station destroyed in the blaze. This includes replacing the fire station, barracks, engine garage and pumphouse, along with some site utilities, such as a water well, solar connections and access roads.[249]\n\n\nDue to the remoteness of the region, it may take first responders more than one hour to respond to an emergency event. Following initial response and depending on the location, the nearest hospital is up to an hour away. In critical cases, patients can be flown out by air ambulance depending on their injuries and weather conditions.[86]\n\n\nThe volunteer Mid Coast Fire Brigade located on Palo Colorado Road was organized in June, 1979. Residents raised $300,000 to build a firehouse.[250] Members receive training in CPR, defibrillation, rope rescue, vehicle extrication, water rescue as well as structural, vehicle and wildland firefighting skills.[251] As of 2004[update], there were about 300 households in the Palo Colorado Canyon area. \n\n\nThe volunteer Big Sur Fire Brigade was founded by Gary Koeppel on August 1, 1974. He persuaded Walter Trotter, a member of a pioneer Big Sur family, to become the first fire chief. Trotter was enormously well-known and influential, and he very quickly appointed a number of volunteers. The brigade provides emergency response from mile marker 58.3 north of the Little Sur River bridge on Highway 1 to the San Luis Obispo County Line. The department has two stations. Station 1 is located south of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park at the Post Ranch. Station 2 is located near Gorda.[252]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nTwo schools are available to students in Big Sur. To the north, the Captain Cooper School serves 52 students from grades K-5 who live in the vicinity of Palo Colorado Canyon, Big Sur Village, Posts, and Slates Hot Springs. The land for the school was donated in 1962 by Frances Molera. She stipulated that it be named after her pioneer grandfather, Juan B. R. Cooper, who bought Rancho El Sur in 1840. The school was built by community members without assistance from the Carmel Unified School District, who assumed management of the school once it was complete.[253] Older students take a bus to Carmel schools.[254][255]\n\n\nTo the south, the Pacific Valley School was founded by the Plaskett family in 1880. It serves 22 students in grades K\u201312 in the areas near Plaskett, Lucia, and Gorda.[256] Closed repeatedly due to low or no enrollment, it reopened in the 1950s. Pacific Valley School is one of two schools in the Big Sur Unified School District. It has a 3:1 student/teacher ratio. They engage in collaborative learning between age groups.[257][258]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nAt the county level, Big Sur is represented on the Monterey County Board of Supervisors by Mary Adams.[259] In the California State Assembly, Big Sur is in the 17th Senate District, represented by Democrat John Laird, and in the 30th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Dawn Addis.[260] In the United States House of Representatives, Big Sur is in California's 19th congressional district, represented by Democrat Jimmy Panetta.[261]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n### In literature[edit]\n\n\nIn 1962, famous Beat author Jack Kerouac released the novel *Big Sur*, which prominently features the location throughout the narrative. It became one of Kerouc\u2019s most prolific works.[262]\n\n\nIn 1995, prominent environmentalist David Brower published *Not Man Apart: Photographs of the Big Sur Coast*, featuring Jeffers' poetry and photography of the Big Sur coast. In the posthumously published 2002 book *Stones of the Sur*, Carmel landscape photographer Morley Baer combined his classical black-and-white photographs of Big Sur with some of Jeffers' poetry.[263][264]\n\n\n\n### In film[edit]\n\n\nThe area's increasing popularity and reputation for beauty have attracted the attention of movie and television personalities and producers. Orson Welles and his wife at the time, Rita Hayworth, bought a Big Sur cabin on impulse during a trip down the coast in 1944. The couple never spent a single night there, and the property is now the location of a popular restaurant, Nepenthe.[265]\n\n\nA number of well-known films are set in Big Sur, including *The Sandpiper* (1965), starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Eva Marie Saint and Charles Bronson. The 1974 film *Zandy's Bride*, starring Gene Hackman and Liv Ullmann, was also based in the region.[266] In 2013, Jack Kerouac's novel *Big Sur* was adapted into a film of the same name, starring Kate Bosworth and directed by the actress' husband, Michael Polish. As of 2017[update], 19 movies had been filmed in the Big Sur region, beginning with *Suspicion* in 1941.[267]\n\n\n\n### In music[edit]\n\n\n\"California Saga: California\" (1973), a single on The Beach Boys' album *Holland*, depicts the rugged wilderness in the area and the culture of its inhabitants.[268]\n\n\n\"Going Back to Big Sur\" was written by Johnny Rivers, who sang it on his 1968 album \"Realization.\"[269] The closing stanzas: \"Guess I'll drive up Highway One / Did the ocean kiss the setting sun? / The stars dancing in the sky / Sort of puts you on a natural high\nGoing back to Big Sur / This time, I might just stay /I'm going back and straighten out my head /Just south of Monterey / And that girl.\"\n\n\nThe song \"Big Sur Moon\" from Buckethead's album Colma is named after the area.[270]\n\n\nThe song \"Bixby Canyon Bridge\" from Death Cab for Cutie's album *Narrow Stairs* explores the narrator's visit to Big Sur, waiting for an epiphany that never comes.[271]\n\n\n*The Dharma at Big Sur*, by John Adams, for electric violin and orchestra, was composed in 2003 for the opening of Disney Hall in Los Angeles.[272]\n\n\nAlanis Morissette released the song *Big Sur* as her \"ode to Big Sur with all its majesty\" as exclusive bonus track on the Target edition of her 2012 Havoc and Bright Lights album.[273] The song was released as single in 2014.\n\n\n\n### In computing[edit]\n\n\nApple's desktop operating system, macOS Big Sur, announced on June 22, 2020, during WWDC, is named after this region.[274]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Big Sur Land Trust\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Marvinney, Craig A.

The island covers an area of about 75 square miles (194 square kilometers). It features a diverse and rugged landscape, including rolling hills, canyons, coastal cliffs, and sandy beaches. The island's highest peak is Mount Orizaba, rising to an elevation of 2,097 feet (639 meters). The island is 22 mi (35 km) long and 8 mi (13 km) across at its largest width. The island is situated in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 29 mi (47 km) south-southwest of Long Beach, California. Geologically, Santa Catalina is part of the is the southernmost island of the Channel Islands of California. Politically, Catalina Island is part of Los Angeles County in District 4. Most of the island's land is unincorporated and is thus governed by the county.\n\n\nCatalina was originally inhabited and used by many different Southern California Tribes, including the Tongva, who called the island *Pimuu'nga* or *Pimu* and referred to themselves as *Pimugnans* or *Pimuvit*. The first Europeans to arrive on Catalina claimed it for the Spanish Empire. Over the years, territorial claims to the island transferred ownership to Mexico and then the United States of America. During this time, (1920-1922) it was the Prohibition era in the United States. The island was sporadically used for smuggling operations involving the illicit transportation of alcohol. The island was also used for otter hunting, and gold-digging, before successfully being developed into a tourist destination in the 1920s. Since the 1970s, most of the island has been administered by the Catalina Island Conservancy.\n\n\nIn 2022 Santa Catalina Island's population was 4,201 people, with a 51.44 percent to 48.56 percent ratio of male to female residents. 90 percent of whom live in the island's only incorporated city, Avalon. The second center of population is the unincorporated village of Two Harbors at the island's isthmus. Development also occurs at the smaller settlements of Rancho Escondido and Middle Ranch. The remaining population is scattered over the island between the two population centers.\n\n\nToday, the popular tourist destination can be reached via ferry services from mainland California, with the most common departure point being the city of Long Beach.[1] The island also has an airport named, the Catalina Airport in the Sky, which is located on a hilltop and offers spectacular views of the island.[2]\n\n\nCatalina Island is known for its diverse ecosystems, which include coastal scrub, chaparral, oak woodlands, grasslands, and coastal marine environments. It is also home to various native and introduced species, both on land and in the surrounding waters. Unique species include the island fox and the Catalina Island rattlesnake.[3] The city of Avalon, located on the island's eastern side, is the primary population center and serves as the hub for tourism. Visitors can explore Avalon's streets, visit museums, dine in restaurants, and enjoy various water-based activities such as snorkeling, scuba diving, and boat tours. The island offers opportunities for hiking, biking, camping, and wildlife watching. Catalina Island enjoys a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The climate makes it an attractive destination year-round, although the summer months tend to be the busiest. Throughout the year, Catalina Island hosts a variety of events and activities, including the Catalina Wine Mixer, the Catalina Island JazzTrax Festival, and many more cultural and outdoor events. A tourist-drawing area, Catalina is heavily reliant economically on revenue from its annual visitors.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Santa Catalina Island (California)\n\n![](image)*Ti'at* are plank boats still constructed by the Tongva to travel from the mainland to Pimu (Santa Catalina Island) similar to the Chumash *tomol* (pictured).[5]\nArcheological evidence of Native American settlement dates back to 7000 BC. Prior to the modern era, the island was inhabited by the Tongva, who, had the villages, Chowigna (San Pedro) and Guashna (Playa del Rey), regularly traveled back and forth to Catalina for trade. The Tongva had settlements all over the island, with their biggest villages being at the Isthmus and at present-day Avalon, Shark/Little Harbor, and Emerald Bay.[1] They were renowned for their mining, working and the trade of soapstone which was found in great quantities and varieties on the island. This material was in great demand and was traded along the California coast. The island was valued for its natural resources, but was also respected by the Tongva as an important \"ceremonial center\" with connections to the village of *Povuu'nga*, located in present-day Long Beach.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo\nThe first European to set foot on the island was the explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo, who sailed in the name of the Spanish crown. On October 7, 1542, he claimed the island for Spain and named it *San Salvador* after his ship. Although his interactions with Catalina Island are not well-documented, his main achievement was in mapping and exploring the coastline, which helped lay the foundation for future European expeditions and settlements in California.[7] Over half a century later, another Spanish explorer, Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno, arrived at the island on the eve of Saint Catherine's day (November 24) of 1602. Vizcaino renamed the island in the saint's honor. [1] The colonization of California by the Spanish greatly contributed to the decline of the Pimugnans because of diseases brought by the Spanish from Europe. By the 1830s, the island's entire native population had been forced to the mainland on the Spanish missions or to work as ranch hands for the many private land owners.[1]\n\n\nIn the late 18th century, the Franciscan friars considered building a mission on Catalina, but abandoned the idea due to the island's rugged terrain, small population size, and lack of fresh water. While Spain maintained its claim on Catalina Island, the Europeans were forbidden to trade with colonies. However, this policy was short lasted as the island lacked the ships to enforce this prohibition; also, much of the colonies wanted to trade with other European powers. During the period stretching from the late 18th to early 19th centuries, Russian hunters from the Aleutian Islands, particularly the Russian-American Company, visited Catalina Island as part of their fur trading expeditions. They were primarily interested in harvesting sea otters for their valuable fur, which led to the decimation of the local sea otter population. The hunting done by the Russian-American's caused a profound ecological impact on the marine life around Catalina Island by depleting a keystone species.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith its numerous hidden coves and relatively low population, the island has been considered a potentially attractive location for pirates and smugglers, much like other coastal areas. While there are historical indications that such activities may have occurred at various times, concrete documented accounts of piracy or significant smuggling operations on the island are limited.[1] During the 1850s and 1860s, Catalina Island witnessed a minor gold rush, as part of the larger California Gold Rush of that era. Gold miners arrived on the island in search of valuable minerals. However, their scale and success was nothing to be compared to the more prosperous gold rush locations in California. The historical evidence regarding substantial gold deposits on the island remains inconclusive.[8]\n\n\nIn 1846, Governor P\u00edo Pico made a Mexican land grant of the Island of Santa Catalina to Thomas M. Robbins, as Rancho Santa Catalina. Robbins established a small ranch on the island, but sold it in 1850 to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Covarrubias. A claim was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1853,[9] and in 1867, the grant was officially patented to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Covarrubias.[10] Covarrubias, in turn, sold the island to Albert Packard of Santa Barbara in 1853. By 1864, the entirety of Catalina Island was under the ownership of James Lick, whose estate maintained control over the island for the following approximately 25 years.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tourists enjoying the waters off Catalina in 1889\n![](image)Hotel Metropole in 1901\nBy the end of the 19th century, the island was almost uninhabited except for a few cattle herders. The first owner to try to develop Avalon into a resort destination was George Shatto, a real estate speculator from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Shatto purchased the island for $200,000 (equivalent to $5.9 million in 2023[12]) from the Lick estate at the height of the real estate boom in Southern California in 1887.[13] Shatto created the settlement that would become Avalon, and can be credited with building the town's first hotel, the original Hotel Metropole, and pier.[13] Despite Shatto's efforts, he defaulted on his loan after only a few years and the island went back to the Lick estate.[1] The sons of Phineas Banning bought the island in 1891 from the estate of James Lick. The Banning brothers fulfilled Shatto's dream of making Avalon a resort community with the construction of numerous tourist facilities. On November 29, 1915, a fire burned half of Avalon's buildings, including six hotels and several clubs. In the face of huge debt related to the fire and the subsequent decline in tourism due to World War I, the Banning brothers were forced to sell the island in shares in 1919. On May 10, 1912 Glenn L. Martin flew a homemade seaplane in to Avalon, setting records for distance and time.[14] In 1917 the Meteor Company purchased the Chinese pirate ship *Ning Po*, the oldest pirate ship afloat, built in 1753, and towed her to the Isthmus of Catalina Island for use as a tourist attraction and restaurant, until destroyed there by fire in 1938.[15][16]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Catalina Casino as it appeared in 2007\nOne of the main investors to purchase shares from the Bannings was chewing-gum magnate William Wrigley, Jr. In 1919, Wrigley bought out nearly every share-holder until he owned controlling interest in the Santa Catalina Island Company. Wrigley invested millions in needed infrastructure and attractions to the island, including the construction of the Catalina Casino which opened on May 29, 1929.[1] Wrigley also sought to bring publicity to the island through events and spectacles. Starting in 1921, the Chicago Cubs, also owned by Wrigley, used the island for the team's spring training. The Cubs continued to use the island for spring training until 1951, except during the war years of 1942 to 1945.[17] Following the death of Wrigley, Jr. in 1932, control of the Santa Catalina Island Company passed down to his son, Philip K. Wrigley, who continued his father's work improving the infrastructure of the island.[1]\n\n\nDuring World War II, the island was closed to tourists and used for military training facilities.[18] Catalina's steamships were expropriated for use as troop transports and a number of military camps were established. The U.S. Maritime Service set up a training facility in Avalon, the Coast Guard had training at Two Harbors, the Army Signal Corps maintained a radar station in the interior, the Office of Strategic Services did training at Toyon Bay, and the Navy did underwater demolition training at Emerald Bay.[1][19]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Catalina Island interior is owned and maintained by the Catalina Island Conservancy\nIn 1972, the Brown Berets, a group of Latino activists, Chicanos and Mexican residents occupied Santa Catalina Island, invoking the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which has no mention of the islands. On February 15, 1975, Philip Wrigley deeded 42,135 acres (17,051 hectares) of the island from the Santa Catalina Island Company to the Catalina Island Conservancy that he had helped to establish in 1972. This gave the Conservancy control of nearly 90 percent of the island.[20] The balance of the Santa Catalina Island Company that was not deeded to the Conservancy maintains control of much of its resort properties and operations on the island.[21]\n\n\nActress Natalie Wood drowned in the waters near the settlement of Two Harbors over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend in 1981 in what was ruled an accidental death.[22] Wood and her husband, Robert Wagner, were vacationing aboard their motor yacht, *Splendour,* along with their guest, Christopher Walken, and *Splendour*'s captain, Dennis Davern. As a result of statements by Davern, and other factors, Wood's death certificate was altered to indicate the cause was \"drowning and other undetermined factors\"[23]\n\n\nIn May 2007, the Island Fire was a large wildfire in the island. Largely due to the assistance of 200 Los Angeles County fire fighters transported by U.S. Marine Corps helicopters and U.S Navy hovercraft, only a few structures were destroyed, though 4,750 acres (1,922 hectares) of wildland were burned.[4] In May 2011, another wildfire started near the Isthmus Yacht Club and was fought by 120 firefighters transported by barge from Los Angeles. It was extinguished the next day after burning 117 acres (47\u00a0ha).[24][25]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Silhouette of Catalina Island at sunset, as seen from the mainland\nCatalina Island is a part of the Channel Islands of California, which are a chain of eight islands located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California. These islands are often referred to as the Channel Islands archipelago. They are not part of the mainland but are remnants of an ancient mountain range. Catalina is primarily composed of two distinct rock units: Catalina Schist from the Early Cretaceous (95 to 109 million years ago), and Miocene volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks. The geological makeup of Catalina Island is primarily igneous and metamorphic rock. The island is composed of a variety of rock types, including basalt, schist, granite, and limestone. These rocks originated from volcanic eruptions, magma intrusions, and sedimentary deposits over millions of years.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe island is rich in quartz, to the extent that some beaches on the seaward side have silvery-grey sand.[26] These deposits provide insights into the island's history, as they contain fossils of ancient marine life. The island is situated along the boundary of two tectonic plates: the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. This boundary is marked by the San Andreas Fault and the East Pacific Rise. The islands in this region have been shaped by tectonic uplift and volcanic activity. This means that the Santa Catalina Island land-mass was never directly connected to mainland California. Other geologic factors that contributed to the island topography include further geologic uplift and subsidence, tectonic plate movement, sedimentation, metamorphic activity, weathering, and erosion. The island's landscape is characterized by rugged terrain, including steep cliffs, canyons, and rolling hills. There are also geologic features such as sea caves and marine terraces along the coastline.[3]\n\n\nCatalina Island has been a site of interest for geologists and researchers studying island geology, as well as the processes of island formation, uplift, and erosion. The island's geology has also contributed to the understanding of tectonic plate interactions in the region. One of the most notable geological features on Catalina Island is the \"*Catalina Schist.*\" This metamorphic rock is unique to the island and has been studied for its geologic significance. It is believed to be one of the oldest rocks on the island. The geology of Catalina Island is also important for conservation efforts. The Catalina Island Conservancy plays a role in protecting and managing the island's natural resources, including its geological formations.[27]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSanta Catalina Island has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification *Csb*) with very mild winters. The National Weather Service maintains cooperative weather records at the Santa Catalina airport. The average January temperatures are a maximum of 58.4\u00a0\u00b0F (14.7\u00a0\u00b0C) and a minimum of 47.6\u00a0\u00b0F (8.7\u00a0\u00b0C). Average July temperatures are a maximum of 78.1\u00a0\u00b0F (25.6\u00a0\u00b0C) and a minimum of 60.0\u00a0\u00b0F (15.6\u00a0\u00b0C). There are an average of 12.5 days with highs of 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) or higher and an average of 0.3 days with lows of 32\u00a0\u00b0F (0\u00a0\u00b0C) or lower. The record high temperature was 105\u00a0\u00b0F (41\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 6, 2018, and the record low temperature was 29\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22122\u00a0\u00b0C) on January 11, 1949. Coastal high fog is common during summer, but usually burns off by the afternoon.\n\n\nAverage annual precipitation at the airport is 13.73 inches (34.9\u00a0cm); the highest mountain peaks get up to 17 inches (43\u00a0cm) per year. There are an average of 45 days with measurable precipitation. The wettest year was 1952 with 21.74 inches (55.2\u00a0cm) and the driest year was 1964 with 5.53 inches (14.0\u00a0cm). The most precipitation in one month was 7.81 inches (19.8\u00a0cm) in January 1952. The most precipitation in 24 hours was 2.95 inches (7.5\u00a0cm) on December 5, 1966. Snowfall is a rarity on the island, averaging only 0.4 inches (1.0\u00a0cm) a year at the airport, but 4.0 inches (10\u00a0cm) fell in 1949, including 3.0 inches (7.6\u00a0cm) in January.[28]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Santa Catalina WB Airport, California (1981\u20132010, extremes 1948\u2013present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 85(29)\n | 87(31)\n | 90(32)\n | 92(33)\n | 96(36)\n | 101(38)\n | 100(38)\n | 103(39)\n | 104(40)\n | 98(37)\n | 89(32)\n | 81(27)\n | 104(40)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 60.4(15.8)\n | 60.2(15.7)\n | 61.2(16.2)\n | 62.5(16.9)\n | 65.6(18.7)\n | 69.1(20.6)\n | 75.4(24.1)\n | 77.6(25.3)\n | 75.4(24.1)\n | 71.7(22.1)\n | 64.8(18.2)\n | 59.3(15.2)\n | 67.0(19.4)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 55.0(12.8)\n | 54.2(12.3)\n | 54.9(12.7)\n | 55.7(13.2)\n | 58.9(14.9)\n | 61.7(16.5)\n | 67.4(19.7)\n | 69.7(20.9)\n | 68.5(20.3)\n | 64.7(18.2)\n | 58.9(14.9)\n | 53.9(12.2)\n | 60.3(15.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 49.5(9.7)\n | 48.2(9.0)\n | 48.5(9.2)\n | 48.9(9.4)\n | 52.1(11.2)\n | 54.3(12.4)\n | 59.5(15.3)\n | 61.7(16.5)\n | 61.5(16.4)\n | 57.7(14.3)\n | 53.0(11.7)\n | 48.6(9.2)\n | 53.7(12.1)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 29(\u22122)\n | 32(0)\n | 36(2)\n | 39(4)\n | 43(6)\n | 45(7)\n | 49(9)\n | 50(10)\n | 48(9)\n | 41(5)\n | 37(3)\n | 34(1)\n | 29(\u22122)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 2.83(72)\n | 3.06(78)\n | 2.05(52)\n | 0.71(18)\n | 0.21(5.3)\n | 0.22(5.6)\n | 0.06(1.5)\n | 0.05(1.3)\n | 0.21(5.3)\n | 0.64(16)\n | 1.23(31)\n | 2.46(62)\n | 13.73(348)\n |\n| Source: NOAA[29][30] |\n\n### El Ni\u00f1o[edit]\n\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is a climate pattern characterized by the periodic warming of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. Conducted in the vicinity of Santa Catalina Island, a well-established research project was derived to investigate how El Ni\u00f1o events influence the local hydrography and the growth dynamics of giant kelp populations in the area. Data collection involved the measurement of sea surface temperatures, kelp biomass, and other pertinent environmental variables during both El Ni\u00f1o events and non-El Ni\u00f1o periods.[31]\n\n\nIt was concluded[*by whom?*] that this temperature rise has had diverse effects on the local hydrography, including shifts in water circulation patterns, heightened nutrient available, and alterations in light penetration.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n*Macrocystis pyrifera*, a species of giant kelp, is a pivotal component of the underwater ecosystem of Catalina Island. The study discerned both positive and negative effects of El Ni\u00f1o events on giant kelp The *Positive Effects* were that El Ni\u00f1o caused an increase in nutrient levels, resulting from shifts in ocean currents, which, in turn, benefited kelp growth in certain areas. The *Negative Effects* were the warm waters accompanying El Ni\u00f1o which can have detrimental consequences for kelp as the warm water disrupts the normal nutrient-rich upwelling, a process vital for kelp growth.[31]\n\n\n\n## Wildlife[edit]\n\n\nSince Catalina Island was never connected to mainland California, it originally lacked any terrestrial life. Any plants or animals that arrived on the island had to make their way across miles of open ocean. The original species to come to the island arrived by chance by blowing over on the wind, drifting or swimming over the ocean, or flown over by wing. Starting with the Native Americans, animals and plants have also been introduced by humans, both intentionally or accidentally.[32]\n\n\nCatalina is home to at least fifty endemic species and subspecies that occur naturally on the island and nowhere else in the world.[33] This limited distribution of a species may result from the extinction of the original population on the mainland combined with its continued survival on the island where there may be fewer threats to its continued existence.[34]\n\n\n\n### Flora[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Catalina manzanita, one of the island's endemic plants\nThe most common native plant communities of Catalina Island are chaparral, coastal sage scrub, island oak-ironwood woodland, and grassland. These ecosystems are integral to the island's biodiversity and have adapted to its Mediterranean climate and conditions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nCatalina Island is home to approximately 400 species of native plants, each playing a vital role in the island's ecosystem. Among these species, six are considered endemic, meaning they are found only on Catalina Island and nowhere else in the world.[35] These endemics include the Catalina manzanita (*Arctostaphylos catalinae*); Catalina mahogany (*Cercocarpus traskiae*); Catalina dudleya (*Dudleya hassei*); St. Catherine's lace (*Eriogonum giganteum* var. *giganteum*); Santa Catalina bedstraw (*Galium catalinense* ssp. *catalinense*); and Santa Catalina Island ironwood (*Lyonothamnus floribundus* ssp. *floribundus*). Additionally, there's a disjunctive population of toyon var. macrocarpa that is unique to Santa Catalina Island.[36] The Wrigley Memorial & Botanical Gardens on the island provide an opportunity for visitors to appreciate and learn about these endemic and native plant species. The gardens emphasize the importance of preserving and showcasing the island's exceptional flora.[37]\n\n\nIn addition to native and endemic species, Catalina Island has been impacted by introduced species, which were introduced by human activities. Some of these introduced species, like eucalyptus trees, have become common on the island and can sometimes outcompete native flora. Conservation efforts, led by organizations such as the Catalina Island Conservancy, aim to manage and control invasive species to protect the native ecosystem. Catalina Island has also been a focal point for botanical research, attracting botanists and researchers who study the island's unique plant species. These studies contribute to our understanding of plant adaptation, island ecology, and conservation.[38]\n\n\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bison on Catalina Island\nThe island is home to five native land mammals: the island fox, the *Spermophilus beecheyi nesioticus* subspecies of California ground squirrel, the Santa Catalina Island harvest mouse (*Reithrodontomys megalotis catalinae*), the Santa Catalina Island deer mouse (*Peromyscus maniculatus catalinae*), and the ornate shrew (*Sorex ornatus*). Only one ornate shrew was ever found, from a now-developed spring area above Avalon. Shrews are difficult to capture and may survive in wetter areas of the island.[39]\n\n\nThe Catalina orangetip butterfly is a notable insect on the island. The Southern Pacific rattlesnake (*Crotalus oreganus helleri*) is also present on the island. This species should not be confused for the Santa Catalina rattlesnake, found on Santa Catalina Island, Mexico.[40]\n\n\nThe Catalina Island bison herd consists of American bison maintained and monitored by the Catalina Island Conservancy. In the 1920s to 1930s, several bison were brought onto Catalina Island for a movie.[41] The bison are popular with the tourists and buildings have painted images of bison and bison weather vanes. Over the decades, the bison herd grew to as many as 600. The population numbered approximately 150 in 2009.[42]\n\n\nOther non-native animals currently living on the island include the blackbuck, bullfrog, feral cat, mule deer, rat, and common starling. Mule deer were introduced to the island in the 1920s and 30s, and currently have a population density roughly 10 times that of California generally.[43] The island was also previously home to populations of cattle, feral goat, feral pig, and sheep, but these animals are no longer present.[44]\n\n\nAccording to the Catalina Island Conservancy, there are 37 resident bird species on the island.[45] Considerably more marine, pelagic, and migrating birds frequent the island, and 127 species have been reported to the Cornell University eBird database from 10 different eBird hotspots.[46] There are several live camera feeds showing bald eagle nests on the island; nests are active February\u2013July.\n\n\nIn the waters surrounding the island, there are schools of fish like Garibaldi, California sheephead, leopard sharks, white seabass, yellowtail, bat rays, giant sea bass, and many more.[47] Great white sharks are also occasionally found or caught off the coast of Catalina, though usually around seal rookeries and not around inhabited areas.[48] \nCommon marine mammals around Catalina include California sea lions and harbor seals.[40]\n\n\nThe Catalina macaw, a type of hybrid parrot, was first bred at Catalina Bird Park in 1940 and is named after Santa Catalina Island.[49]\n\n\n\n### Conservation[edit]\n\n\nMost of the island is managed by the Catalina Island Conservancy, a private nonprofit organization. The mission of the Catalina Island Conservancy is to be a steward of its lands through a balance of conservation, education and recreation. The Conservancy protects the natural and cultural heritage of Santa Catalina Island, stewarding approximately 42,000 acres (170\u00a0km2) of land (88 percent of the island), 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) of shoreline, an airport, and more than 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) of roads.[50]\n\n\nOne of the Conservancy's key goals is the conservation of the island fox, an endangered endemic species. In 1999, all but 100 out of 1,300 foxes on Catalina Island were wiped out because of a virulent strain of canine distemper. Following a successful recovery program which included captive breeding, distemper vaccinations and population monitoring, the Catalina fox community has been restored to more than 1570 in 2018.[51][52] However, mysterious, usually fatal ear tumors continue to plague the Catalina fox. Three Catalina Island Conservancy wildlife biologists continue to monitor the population through pit tagging, trapping and inspection.[53] The conservancy group vaccinates around 300 foxes every year and monitors 50 unvaccinated foxes via radio collar to watch for signs of new disease outbreaks.[54] The current leading cause of death among Island Foxes is road strikes; to combat this, the Conservancy installed new signage about Island Foxes. The Conservancy also introduced wild-life proof trash cans to protect foxes from human garbage, informs boaters about the possibility and danger of wildlife stowaways, and asks dog owners to keep their animals leashed.[54]\n\n\nThe Institute for Wildlife Studies, a separate conservation organization, has worked to restore bald eagles to the island on Conservancy land since the late 1970s. Bald eagles had been common on the island until the 1960s, when it is believed that the effects of dumping the pesticide DDT off the coast of Southern California made it impossible for eagles to successfully hatch their young. The reintroduction of the bald eagle to the island may also edge out an invasive golden eagle population that threatens the native island fox.[55]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Arrow Point to Lion Head Point State Marine Conservation Area\n\nFurther information: Cat Harbor State Marine Conservation Area\n\n### Grazing and fire management[edit]\n\n\nGrazing practices on Santa Catalina Island have a historical legacy dating back to the late 19th century when ranching operations were established. During this period, livestock, primarily sheep and cattle, were introduced to the island, marking the beginning of a substantial human impact on its ecology. [26]\n\n\nThe introduction of herbivores for grazing had significant ecological consequences for the island. Overgrazing by these introduced animals led to the removal of native vegetation and substantially altered the composition of plant communities. As a result, this overgrazing caused notable changes in the island's ecosystem dynamics, influencing both its flora and fauna.[38]\n\n\nThe ecological effects of grazing practices raised legitimate concerns about habitat degradation and the decline of native plant species on Santa Catalina Island. Conservationists and environmentalists responded by considering management strategies to address the negative impacts of grazing and to protect the island's unique flora. This prompted the implementation of conservation efforts to manage and mitigate the ecological consequences of livestock grazing, with the goal of preserving the island's natural heritage.[56]\n\n\nFire is an intrinsic element of the Mediterranean climate in Southern California, and it has played a crucial role in shaping the region's ecosystems over time. Historically, fires occurred infrequently but were a natural part of the landscape. Native plant species have adapted to these fire cycles, and their life histories often depend on periodic burning for regeneration.[57]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, a shift occurred towards extensive fire suppression efforts. These efforts, while well-intentioned to safeguard property and human life, resulted in the accumulation of vegetation, leading to an increased risk of catastrophic wildfires. The suppression of fire disrupted the natural fire regimes that had shaped the region for millennia and had unintended ecological consequences, including changes in plant composition and fuel load.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nContemporary fire management on the island strives to strike a balance between the ecological role of fire and the necessity of protecting human structures and lives. This involves a more nuanced approach that recognizes the importance of fire in maintaining healthy ecosystems.[58]Controlled burns, also known as prescribed fires, are one technique employed to reduce the risk of severe wildfires. These managed fires are intentionally set under controlled conditions to reduce excess vegetation and restore natural fire regimes. Other strategies, such as fuel reduction efforts and public education, are also integral to fire management on Santa Catalina Island. The goal is to protect both human communities and the island's ecological integrity while respecting the historical role of fire in shaping its landscapes.[56]\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Avalon beach in summertime\n![](image)Avalon in March 2015\n![](image)Two Harbors, the smaller of the island's two population centers, in 2015\nOver one million people travel to Catalina Island every year,[59] accounting for $166.7 million in annual direct spending on the Island.[60]\n\n\nGlass bottom boats tour the reefs and shipwrecks of the area, and scuba diving and snorkeling are popular in the clear water. Lover's Cove, to the east of Avalon, and Descanso Beach, to the west of the Casino, are popular places to dive. At Casino Point is the Avalon Underwater Dive Park, which was the first non-profit underwater park in the United States.[61] The area flying fish and the bright orange Garibaldi are attractions.[*citation needed*] Parasailing is also offered. Jeep and bus tours are given of the interior, which is a conservation area managed by the Catalina Island Conservancy. The Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce & Visitors Bureau operates the official island visitor center and provides visitor services[62] assists tourists with any information on how to get to Catalina Island.\n\n\nTwo Harbors is the second, and much smaller, resort village on the island.[63] Located at the isthmus of the island, northwest of Avalon, it is the primary landing spot for those who wish to tour the western half of the island. It is accessible by boat from San Pedro and by bus or boat from Avalon. While tourists rarely have an opportunity to surf, two beaches on the back side of Catalina offer good waves: Shark Harbor and Ben Weston Beach. There are also two camps, Camp Cherry Valley and Camp Emerald Bay, on the northeastern end of the island that offer summer camps for children and Boy Scouts.\n\n\nThe Catalina Island Museum, formerly located in the historic Catalina Casino but since 2016 in a standalone building,[64] is also an attraction as it is the keeper of the island's cultural heritage with collections numbering over 100,000 items and including over 8,000 years of Native American history, over 10,000 photographs and images, a large collection of Catalina-made pottery and tiles, ship models, and much more. The museum features dynamic exhibits on this history, an art gallery, special exhibitions traveling from around the world, and a unique Museum Store. Programs include First Fridays at the Museum, an annual tour of the historic Tuna Club, a Holiday Symphony Concert, book signings, gallery talks, an annual silent film benefit and more. From 1927 until 1937, pottery and tiles were made on the island at the Catalina Clay Products Company, and these items are now highly sought-after collectibles.[65]\n\n\n\n\n![](image)\nCatalina panorama, taken from a sail boat; Avalon is to the far left, Two Harbors to the mid-right.\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sunrise view of the Wrigley Institute lab and Big Fisherman's CoveChildren in Avalon attend schools in the Long Beach Unified School District. There were two schools on Catalina Island. Two Harbors was served by a one-room school house, but it closed down in 2014; students must now travel to Avalon for all grades K\u201312.[66] Avalon schools are housed on one main campus that includes Avalon Elementary School, Avalon Middle School and Avalon High School.[67] Thousands of school-age youths travel from the mainland to study at the Catalina Island Marine Institute every year.[68]\n\n\nThere is also a branch of the County of Los Angeles Public Library system in downtown Avalon, adjacent to the Sheriff's office.[69]\n\n\nThe USC Wrigley Marine Science Center houses research and teaching facilities at Big Fisherman's Cove, near Two Harbors, for the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies. Maintained by the University of Southern California and named for Philip K. Wrigley, it consists of a 30,000-square-foot (3,000\u00a0m2) laboratory building, dormitory housing, cafeteria, a hyperbaric chamber,[70] and a large waterfront staging area complete with dock, pier, helipad, and diving lockers. The facility was expanded with a donation from the Wrigley family in 1995.[71] The institute is open for public visits as part of its \"Saturdays at the Lab\"[72] program.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nCatalina is the starting point for the Catalina Channel swim, the second jewel in the Triple Crown of Open Water Swimming, along with the English Channel, and Manhattan Island. In 1927, a 17-year-old Canadian swimmer, George Young, became the first person to complete a crossing from Catalina Island to the mainland of California in a time of 15:44.30. Since then, over 500 men and women have completed the 20.1 mile swim from Doctor's Cove on Catalina to the mainland near Point Vicente Lighthouse and Rancho Palos Verdes.[73]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Catalina Airport, also known as the Airport-in-the-Sky\n![](image)Little Harbor on the backside of Catalina\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Ferries depart from Long Beach and San Pedro in Los Angeles County as well as Dana Point and Newport Beach in Orange County. The crossing takes approximately an hour.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHelicopter service is also available from Long Beach or San Pedro.[74]\n\n\nCatalina has also been an active port of call for many cruise lines since the 1990s, with Royal Caribbean, Princess Cruises, and Carnival Cruise Lines making the port a regular stop on Baja cruises. The ships anchor about 1,000 feet off Avalon Harbor. Passengers disembark through shore boat tendering services.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe island is also home to the Catalina Airport (FAA Identifier: AVX), also known as Airport-in-the-Sky. The airport terminal was built in 1946 through the efforts of Dick Probert. The runway was built by Philip Wrigley in 1941, who leveled two adjacent hilltops and filled the canyon between them. It was called Buffalo Springs Airport, and was not opened for public use until 1946. By the 2000s the 3,000' (900m) runway was in serious disrepair, and arrangements were made in 2018 to have the Marines replace it with a concrete runway.[75] The work was performed in January 2019, and the airport was returned to service on 3 May.[76] The airport is located 7 miles (11\u00a0km) northwest of Avalon. The runway is 1,602 feet (488\u00a0m) above sea level.[77] Until the time of the airport's construction, the only scheduled passenger air service to the island was provided by seaplanes and helicopters at the Pebbly Beach Seaplane Base (FAA Identifier: L11).[78][79]\n\n\nThe use of motor vehicles on the island is restricted; there is a limit on the number of full-sized vehicles, which translates into a 25-year-long wait list to bring a private car to the island.[80] Most residents use golf carts or mini cars for transportation. Because of these restrictions, there is no regularly scheduled vehicle ferry service. Tourists can hire a taxi from Catalina Transportation Services. Bicycles are also a popular mode of transportation. There are a number of bicycle and golf cart rental agencies on the island. Only the city of Avalon is open to the public without restrictions. The only major road into the back country is Stage Road. Under an agreement with Los Angeles County, the Conservancy has granted an easement to allow day hiking and mountain biking, but visitors must first obtain a permit at the Conservancy's office (on which they declare the parts of the island they intend to visit). Hiking permits are free, whereas bicycle permits are available for a fee.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Communication[edit]\n\n\nCatalina's isolation offered good opportunities to experiment with new communication technologies throughout its history. The first of these communication innovations was the use of pigeons by Catalina's gold prospectors. Homing pigeons delivered messages to the mainland in 45 minutes, compared to 10 days to deliver mail from Isthmus to Wilmington by regular post in 1864. Even today, Avalon Post Office does not match the airmail service enjoyed by the miners. Pigeons were used to deliver messages for Catalina residents until 1899.[81] By 1902, the first commercial wireless telegraph station was built in Avalon where the Chimes Tower now stands.\n\n\nOn July 16, 1920, the world's first commercial wireless radiotelephone toll circuit was opened to the public between San Pedro and Avalon.[82] Designed by and installed under the direction of Western Electric Company/Bell Labs engineer Lewis M. Clement (1892\u20131979), the system drew other engineers from all over the world to study it.[83][84] The Avalon telephone directory in 1920 listed 52 subscribers serviced by a manual switchboard. People stood for hours to use this new technology, the only drawback of which was that all conversations could be monitored by anyone listening to their radio. Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. solved that problem with the installation of two submarine cables running 23 miles (37\u00a0km) from Avalon to San Pedro in 1923. Another communication first touched Catalina when the world's first commercial microwave telephone system was installed in 1946. Although microwave telephones had been used for wartime applications, this was the first peacetime use of this technology.[85]\n\n\nCatalina's isolation also left the island as the last central office in the US Bell System to operate entirely using manual switchboard operators.[86] The Catalina Island exchange was converted to dial in 1978. The island shares area code 310 and overlay area code 424 with parts of Ventura and Los Angeles County.[87]\n\n\n\n### Emergency services[edit]\n\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) operates the Avalon Station serving Santa Catalina Island.[88]\n\n\nFire Protection is provided by the Avalon Fire Department inside city limits, and by the Los Angeles County Fire Department in other areas of the island. Two county fire stations are located on Catalina Island: Station #55 is located just outside Avalon in Avalon Canyon and on-call firefighters staff Station #155 in Two Harbors.[89]\n\n\nParamedic and lifeguard services are provided by the County Fire Department's Lifeguard Division, also known as Baywatch.[90] Catalina Island Medical Center, located in Avalon, is the island's only hospital/medical center. It operates around the clock. Baywatch operates Baywatch Rescue/Lifeguard Boats.[91][92]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\nFor decades the water was supplied primarily by a reservoir.[93] Forty percent of drinking water on the island is provided by a desalination plant that opened in Avalon in 2016.[94]\n\n\nAvalon's sewer system was identified by researchers as the cause of ocean pollution in 2011. Many of the city's century-old clay and metal pipes had deteriorated to the point where they had vanished, allowing human sewage to enter into the bay.[95] From 2000 to 2013, 11 out of 13 annual reports released by the Natural Resources Defense Council listed Avalon as one of the 10 most chronically polluted beaches in the nation for failing state health tests as much as 73% of the time.[96] In February 2012, a cease and desist order was issued against the City for illegally discharging polluted water into the bay. The city invested $5.7 million on sewer main improvements and inspection and tracking systems. The 2014 report showed that water quality had improved, and Avalon Beach was removed from the list of the most polluted beaches.[97][98]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n### Film and television[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of films and TV series set in Santa Catalina Island, California\n\nIn its heyday in the 1930s, due to its proximity to Hollywood, Catalina Island was a favored getaway destination for Hollywood stars such as Clark Gable. The island also served as a filming location for dozens of movies.[99]\n\n\nThe 2008 movie *Step Brothers* features a so-called Catalina Wine Mixer event. While the scene in the movie was filmed at the Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, the real island can be seen offshore in the background.[100] The movie inspired a real-life Catalina Wine Mixer, hosted by the Catalina Island Company every year.[101]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nThe island is mentioned in the 2020 action-adventure game *The Last of Us Part II*, and the Catalina Casino building features as the backdrop of the loading screen after the game is completed.[102]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nIn 1920, the song \"Avalon\", which directly references the town of Avalon on the island, was popularized by Al Jolson.[103]\n\n\nIn 1958, The Four Preps released the song \"26 Miles (Santa Catalina)\", which reached number two on the *Billboard* Hot 100 and number six on the *Billboard* R&B chart.\n\n\nThe 1982 Descendents album Milo Goes to College references a fishing trip to the island in a song named \"Catalina\".\n\n\n\n### Computing[edit]\n\n\nApple's desktop operating system, macOS Catalina, announced on June 3 2019 at WWDC, is named after this region.[104]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n* Spencer Davis, musician.\n* Author Zane Grey built a home in Avalon, which once served as the Zane Grey Pueblo Hotel.[105][106]\n* Gregory Harrison, actor, was born in Catalina Island.\n* Marilyn Monroe lived with her first husband, James Dougherty, in the town of Avalon for several months in 1943.[107]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Farnsworth Onshore and Farnsworth Offshore State Marine Conservation Areas\n* Cat Harbor State Marine Conservation Area\n\n\n* ![flag](image) Greater Los Angeles portal\n* ![icon](image) Islands portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** Otte, Stacey; Pedersen, Jeannine (2004). \"Catalina Island History\". *A Catalina Island History in Brief*.

It is located primarily in southeastern California and southwestern Nevada, with small portions extending into Arizona and Utah.[8][2]\n\n\nThe Mojave Desert, together with the Sonoran, Chihuahuan, and Great Basin deserts, forms a larger North American Desert. Of these, the Mojave is the smallest and driest. The Mojave Desert displays typical basin and range topography, generally having a pattern of a series of parallel mountain ranges and valleys. It is also the site of Death Valley, which is the lowest elevation in North America. The Mojave Desert is often colloquially called the \"high desert\", as most of it lies between 2,000 and 4,000 feet (610 and 1,220\u00a0m). It supports a diversity of flora and fauna.\n\n\nThe 54,000 Sq. Mile desert supports a number of human activities, including recreation, ranching, and military training.[9] The Mojave Desert also contains various silver, tungsten, iron and gold deposits.[10]:\u200a124\n\n\nThe spelling *Mojave* originates from the Spanish language, while the spelling *Mohave* comes from modern English. Both are used today, although the Mojave Tribal Nation officially uses the spelling *Mojave*. *Mojave* is a shortened form of *Hamakhaave*, an endonym in their native language, which means \"beside the water\".[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Joshua tree (*Yucca brevifolia*) is endemic and exclusive to the Mojave Desert.[12]\nThe Mojave Desert is a desert bordered to the west by the Sierra Nevada mountain range and the California montane chaparral and woodlands, and to the south and east by the Sonoran Desert. The boundaries to the east of the Mojave Desert are less distinctive than the other boundaries because there is no presence of an indicator species, such as the Joshua tree (*Yucca brevifolia*),[13] which is endemic to the Mojave Desert. The Mojave Desert is distinguished from the Sonoran Desert and other deserts adjacent to it by its warm temperate climate, as well as flora and fauna such as ironwood (*Olneya* *tesota*), blue Palo Verde (*Parkinsonia florida*), chuparosa (*Justicia californica*), spiny menodora (*Menodora spinescens*), desert senna (*Cassia armata*), California dalea (*Psorothamnus arborescens*), and goldenhead (*Acamptopappus shockleyi*). Along with these other factors, these plants differentiate the Mojave from the nearby Sonoran desert.[2]\n\n\nThe Mojave Desert is bordered by the San Andreas fault to the southwest and the Garlock fault to the north. The mountains elevated along the length of the San Andreas fault provide a clear border between the Mojave desert and the coastal regions to the west.[10] The Garlock fault separates the Mojave Desert from the Sierra Nevada and Tehachapi mountains, which provide a natural border to the Mojave Desert. There are also abundant alluvial fans, which are called bajadas, that form around the mountains within the Mojave desert and extend down toward the low altitude basins,[13] which contain dried lake beds called playas, where water generally collects and evaporates, leaving large volumes of salt. These playas include Rogers Dry Lake, and China Lake. Dry lakes are a noted feature of the Mojave landscape.[2] The Mojave Desert is also home to the Devils Playground, about 40 miles (64\u00a0km) of dunes and salt flats going in a northwest-southeasterly direction. The Devil's Playground is a part of the Mojave National Preserve and is between the town of Baker, California and Providence Mountains. The Cronese Mountains are within the Devil's Playground.\n\n\nThere are very few surface rivers in the Mojave Desert, even given the low precipitation level: two major rivers generally flow underground. The intermittent Mojave River, which begins in the San Bernardino mountains and disappears underground in the Mojave Desert.[14] The Amargosa River also flows partly underground through the Mojave Desert along a southward path.[15] The Manix, Mojave, and the Little Mojave lakes are all large but shallow.[13]:\u200a7 Soda Lake is the principal saline basin of the Mojave desert. Natural springs are typically rare throughout the Mojave desert,[13]:\u200a19 however, there are two notable springs, Ash Meadows, and Oasis Valley. Ash Meadows is formed from several other springs, which all draw from deep underground. Oasis Valley draws from the nearby Amargosa River.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nExtremes in temperatures throughout the seasons characterize the climate of the Mojave Desert. Freezing temperatures as well as strong winds are not uncommon in the winter, as well as precipitation such as rain and snow in the mountains. In contrast, temperatures above 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) are not uncommon during the summer months.[16] There is an annual average precipitation of 2 to 6 inches (51 to 152\u00a0mm), although regions at high altitudes such as the portion of the Mojave desert in the San Gabriel mountains may receive more rain.[10][8] Most of the precipitation in the Mojave comes from the Pacific Cyclonic storms that are generally present passing eastward in November to April.[10] Such storms generally bring rain and snow only in the mountainous regions, as a result of the effect of the mountains, which creates a drying effect on its leeward slopes.[10]\n\n\nDuring the late summer months, there is also the possibility of strong thunderstorms, which bring heavy showers or cloudbursts. These storms can result in flash flooding.[17]\n\n\nThe Mojave Desert has not historically supported a fire regime because of low fuel loads and connectivity. However, in the last few decades, invasive annual plants such as some within the genera *Bromus*, *Schismus* and *Brassica* have facilitated fires by serving as a fuel bed. This has significantly altered many areas of the desert. At higher elevations, fire regimes are regular but infrequent.[18]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Furnace Creek, Death Valley, California (1991\u20132020 normals,[a] extremes 1911\u2013present).

The Los Angeles exurban area of Lancaster-Palmdale has more than 400,000 residents, and the Victorville area to its east has more than 300,000 residents.[8] Smaller cities or micropolitan areas in the Mojave Desert include Helendale, Lake Havasu City, Kingman, Laughlin, Bullhead City and Pahrump. All have experienced rapid population growth since 1990. The California portion of the desert also contains Edwards Air Force Base and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, noted for experimental aviation and weapons projects.\n\n\nThe Mojave Desert has several ghost towns. The most significant are the silver and copper-mining town of Calico, California, and the old railroad depot of Kelso, California. Some of the other ghost towns are more modern, created when U.S. Route 66 (and the lesser-known U.S. Route 91) were abandoned in favor of the construction of Interstates. CA SR 14, Interstate 15, Interstate 40, CA SR 58, CA SR 138, US Route 95, and US Route 395 are the main highways that traverse the Mojave Desert.\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rock formations in Joshua Tree National Park\nThe rock that forms the Mojave Desert was likely created under shallow water in the Precambrian.[13]:\u200a21[10]:\u200a115 Sedimentary processes left large deposits of limestones, silicates, and dolomites. During the Paleozoic era, the area that is now the Mojave was again likely submerged under a greater sea.[10]:\u200a116 During the Mesozoic era, major tectonic activities such as thrust faulting and folding resulted in distinctive shaping as well as intrusion.[13][10]:\u200a116 During the Cenozoic, more tectonic deformation occurred whilst the Mojave was partly submerged. Major volcanic activity is thought to have occurred during the Oligocene. Large downpours during the Miocene likely significantly eroded the rock in the Mojave and accelerated deposition.[10]:\u200a116\n\n\nThe Mojave Desert is a source of various minerals and metallic materials. Due to the climate, there is an accumulation of weathered bedrock, fine sand and silt, both sand and silt sediments becoming converted into colluvium.[27] The deposits of gold, tungsten, and silver have been mined frequently prior to the Second World War.[10]:\u200a124 Additionally, there have been deposits of copper, tin, lead-zinc, manganese, iron, and various radioactive substances but they have not been mined for commercial use.[10]:\u200a124\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n### Flora[edit]\n\n\nThe flora of the Mojave desert consists of various endemic plant species, notably the Joshua Tree, which is a notable endemic and indicator species of the desert. There is more endemic flora in the Mojave desert than almost anywhere in the world.[2] Mojave Desert flora is not a vegetation type, although the plants in the area have evolved in isolation because of the physical barriers of the Sierra Nevadas and the Colorado Plateau. Predominant plants of the Mojave desert include all-scale (*Atriplex polycarpa*), creosote bush (*Larrea tridentata*), brittlebush (*Encelia farinosa*), desert holly (*Atriplex hymenelytra*), white burrobush (Hymenoclea salsola), and most notably, the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia). Additionally, the Mojave desert is also home to various species of cacti, such as silver cholla (*Cylindropuntia echinocarpa*), Mojave prickly pear (*O. erinacea*), beavertail cactus (*O. basilaris*), and many-headed barrel cactus (*Echinocactus polycephalus*). Less common but distinctive plants of the Mojave desert include ironwood (*Olneya* *tesota*), blue Palo Verde (*Parkinsonia Florida*), chuparosa (*Justicia californica*), spiny menodora (*Menodora spinescens*), desert senna (*Cassia armata*), California dalea (*Psorothamnus arborescens*), and goldenhead (*Acamptopappus shockleyi*). The Mojave desert is generally abundant in winter annuals.[13]:\u200a11 The plants of the Mojave desert each generally correspond to an individual geographic feature. As such, there are distinctive flora communities within the desert.\n\n\n\n* ![A depiction of cassia armata, which is particularly characteristic of the Mojave](image)\n\nA depiction of cassia armata, which is particularly characteristic of the Mojave\n* ![California Dalea, an indicator species of the Mojave Desert](image)\n\nCalifornia Dalea, an indicator species of the Mojave Desert\n* ![Goldenhead (Acamptopappus shockleyi) an indicator species of the Mojave](image)\n\nGoldenhead (Acamptopappus shockleyi) an indicator species of the Mojave\n* ![Silver cholla (Opuntia echinocarpa), a common species of cacti in the Mojave](image)\n\nSilver cholla (Opuntia echinocarpa), a common species of cacti in the Mojave\n* ![A creosote bush, which is common in the Mojave](image)\n\nA creosote bush, which is common in the Mojave\n\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A desert tortoise, which can be found in the Mojave Desert\nNotable species of the Mojave desert include bighorn sheep (*Ovis canadensis*), mountain lions (*Puma concolor*), black-tailed jackrabbits (*Lepus californicus*), and desert tortoises (*Gopherus agassizii*).[2] Various other species are particularly common in the Mojave Desert, such as the LeConte's thrasher (*Toxostoma lecontei*), banded gecko (*Coleonyx variegatus*), desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis), chuckwalla (*Sauromalus obesus*), and regal horned lizard (*Phrynosoma solare*). Species of snake include the rosy boa (*Lichanura trivirgata*), Western patch-nosed snake (*Salvadora hexalepis*), and Mojave rattlesnake (*Crotalus scutulatus*). These species can also occur in the neighboring Sonoran and Great Basin deserts.\n\n\nThe animal species of the Mojave Desert have generally fewer endemics than its flora. However, endemic fauna of the Mojave Desert include Kelso Dunes jerusalem cricket (*Ammopelmatus kelsoensis),* the Kelso Dunes shieldback katydid (*Eremopedes kelsoensis*), the Mohave ground squirrel (*Spermophilus Mohavensis*) and Amargosa vole (*Microtus californicus scirpensis*).[28] The Mojave fringe-toed lizard (*Uma Scopari*a) is not endemic, but almost completely limited to the Mojave desert. There are also aquatic species that are found nowhere else,[29] such as the Devils Hole pupfish, limited to one hot spring near Death Valley.[30]\n\n\n\n## In society[edit]\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\nBefore the European colonization of North America, tribes of Native Americans, such as the Mohave, were hunter-gatherers living in the Mojave Desert.[31]\n\n\nEuropean explorers started exploring the deserts beginning in the 18th century. Francisco Garc\u00e9s, a Franciscan friar, was the first explorer of the Mojave desert in 1776.[32] Garc\u00e9s recorded information about the original inhabitants of the deserts.\n\n\nLater, as American interests expanded into California, American explorers started probing the California deserts. Jedediah Smith travelled through the Mojave deserts in 1826, finally reaching the San Gabriel Mission.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Human development[edit]\n\n\nIn recent years, human development in the Mojave desert has become increasingly present. Human development at the major urban and suburban centers of Las Vegas and Los Angeles has had an increasingly damaging effect on the wildlife of the Mojave Desert.[2] An added demand for landfill space as a result of the large metropolitan centers of Las Vegas and Los Angeles also has the real potential to drastically affect flora and fauna of the Mojave Desert. Agricultural development along the Colorado river, close to the Eastern boundary of the Mojave Desert, also causes habitat loss and degradation.[8][2] Areas that are particularly affected by human development include Ward Valley and Riverside county. The United States military also maintains installations in the Mojave Desert, making the Mojave a critical training location for the United States Department of Defense.[9] The Mojave Desert has long been a valuable resource for people, and as its human population grows, its importance will only grow. Miners, ranchers, and farmers rely on the desert for a living.[29] The Mojave is also used by the state of California to meet renewable energy objectives. Large tracts of the desert are owned by federal agencies and are leased at low cost by wind and solar energy companies, although these renewable developments can cause their own environmental impact and disturb cultural landscapes and visual resources.[35] Desert Sunlight Solar Farm, one of the largest solar farms in the world, was built approximately five miles from Joshua Tree National Park. An endangered Yuma clapper rail was found dead at the site in 2014, spurring efforts from conservation groups to protect birds from the so-called lake effect, a phenomenon in which birds can mistake the reflective glare of solar panels for a body of water.[36]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Zabriskie point\n\nThe Mojave Desert is one of the most popular spots for tourism in North America, primarily because of the international destination of Las Vegas. The Mojave is also known for its scenery, playing host to Death Valley National Park, Joshua Tree National Park, and the Mojave National Preserve. Lakes Mead, Mohave, and Havasu provide water sports recreation, and vast off-road areas entice off-road enthusiasts. The Mojave Desert also includes three California State Parks, the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve, in Lancaster, Saddleback Butte State Park, in Hi Vista and Red Rock Canyon State Park. Mojave Narrows Park, operated by San Bernardino County, is a former ranch along the Mojave River. \n\n\nSeveral attractions and natural features are in the Calico Mountains. Calico Ghost Town, in Yermo, is administered by San Bernardino County. The ghost town has several shops and attractions and inspired Walter Knott to build Knott's Berry Farm. The Bureau of Land Management also administers Rainbow Basin and Owl Canyon. The Calico Early Man Site, in the Calico Hills east of Yermo, is believed by some archaeologists, including the late Louis Leakey, to show the earliest evidence with lithic stone tools found here of human activity in North America.\n\n\n\n### Conservation status[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A field of California poppies in the California Poppy Reserve in Antelope Valley\nThe Mojave Desert has a relatively stable and intact conservation status. The Mojave Desert is one of the best protected distinct ecoregions in the United States,[2] as a result of the California Desert Protection Act, which designated 69 wilderness areas and established Death Valley National Park, Joshua Tree National Park, and the Mojave National Preserve.[37] However, the southwest and central east portions of the Mojave Desert are particularly threatened as a result of off-road vehicles, increasing recreational use, human development, and agricultural grazing.[2] The World Wildlife Fund lists the Mojave Desert as relatively \"stable/intact\".[2]\n\n\nVarious habitats and regions of the Mojave Desert have been protected by statute. Notably, Joshua Tree National Park, Death Valley National Park, and the Mojave National Preserve by the California Desert Protection Act of 1994. (Pub.L. 103\u2013433). Various other federal and state land agencies have protected regions within the Mojave Desert. These include Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve, which protects the fields of California poppies, Mojave Trails National Monument, Desert Tortoise Natural Area, Arthur B. Ripley Desert Woodland State Park, Desert National Wildlife Refuge, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Providence Mountains State Recreation Area, Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, Red Rock Canyon State Park, Saddleback Butte State Park, Snow Canyon State Park and Valley of Fire State Park. In 2013, the Mojave Desert was further protected from development by the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP), in which the Bureau of Land Management designated 4.2 million acres of public land as protected wilderness as part of the National Conservation Lands of the California Desert. [38]\n\n\n\n### Cultural significance[edit]\n\n\nThe Mojave desert has served as a backdrop for a number of films. The 2010 video game *Fallout: New Vegas* takes place in the Mojave Desert, or \"Mojave Wasteland\" as it is known in its post-apocalyptic future. At least four music videos were recorded in the Mojave Desert:\n\n\n\n* \"Say You'll Be There\" by the Spice Girls[39]\n* \"Goodbye\" by Mimi Webb[40][41]\n* \"Bodies\" by Robbie Williams\n* \"Burden in My Hand\" by Soundgarden\n\n\nPhotographs related to U2's 1987 album *The Joshua Tree* were taken in the Mojave Desert.[42]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Mean maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n2. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Atlas of Global Conservation\". maps.tnc.org.
