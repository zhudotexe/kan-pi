It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in physics.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to 224 individuals as of 2023.[5] The first prize in physics was awarded in 1901 to Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, of Germany, who received 150,782 SEK. John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice—in 1956 and 1972.\n\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7]\n\n\nOnly five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).[8] Before L'Huillier, each woman only ever received a quarter share of the prize, although Marie Curie did receive an unshared Nobel prize in chemistry in 1911. In 2023 L'Huillier received a one-third share.\n\n\nThere have been six years for which the Nobel Prize in Physics was not awarded (1916, 1931, 1934, 1940–1942). There were also nine years for which the Nobel Prize in Physics was delayed for one year:\n\n\n\n* The 1914 prize awarded to Max von Laue was announced only in November 1915.[9]\n* The Prize was not awarded in 1917, as the Nobel Committee for Physics decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Charles Glover Barkla in 1918 and counted as the 1917 prize.[10]\n* This precedent was followed for the 1918 prize awarded to Max Planck in 1919,[11]\n* the 1921 prize awarded to Albert Einstein in 1922,[12]\n* the 1924 prize awarded to Manne Siegbahn in 1925,[13]\n* the 1925 prize awarded to James Franck and Gustav Hertz in 1926,[14]\n* the 1928 prize awarded to Owen Richardson in 1929,[15]\n* the 1932 prize awarded to Werner Heisenberg in 1933,[16] and\n* the 1943 prize awarded to Otto Stern in 1944.[17]\n\n\nIoannidis *et al.* reported that half of the Nobel Prize for science awarded between 1995 and 2017 are clustered in few disciplines. Particle physics (14%), atomic physics (10.9%), and 3 non-physics disciplines are dominating the prize in recent decades. And then semiconductor physics and magnetics are the next most honoured physics disciplines.[18]\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n*

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in physics.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to 224 individuals as of 2023.[5] The first prize in physics was awarded in 1901 to Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, of Germany, who received 150,782 SEK. John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice—in 1956 and 1972.\n\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7]\n\n\nOnly five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).[8] Before L'Huillier, each woman only ever received a quarter share of the prize, although Marie Curie did receive an unshared Nobel prize in chemistry in 1911. In 2023 L'Huillier received a one-third share.\n\n\nThere have been six years for which the Nobel Prize in Physics was not awarded (1916, 1931, 1934, 1940–1942). There were also nine years for which the Nobel Prize in Physics was delayed for one year:\n\n\n\n* The 1914 prize awarded to Max von Laue was announced only in November 1915.[9]\n* The Prize was not awarded in 1917, as the Nobel Committee for Physics decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Charles Glover Barkla in 1918 and counted as the 1917 prize.[10]\n* This precedent was followed for the 1918 prize awarded to Max Planck in 1919,[11]\n* the 1921 prize awarded to Albert Einstein in 1922,[12]\n* the 1924 prize awarded to Manne Siegbahn in 1925,[13]\n* the 1925 prize awarded to James Franck and Gustav Hertz in 1926,[14]\n* the 1928 prize awarded to Owen Richardson in 1929,[15]\n* the 1932 prize awarded to Werner Heisenberg in 1933,[16] and\n* the 1943 prize awarded to Otto Stern in 1944.[17]\n\n\nIoannidis *et al.* reported that half of the Nobel Prize for science awarded between 1995 and 2017 are clustered in few disciplines. Particle physics (14%), atomic physics (10.9%), and 3 non-physics disciplines are dominating the prize in recent decades. And then semiconductor physics and magnetics are the next most honoured physics disciplines.[18]\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n*

He has received several prizes and awards, including the 1988 Wolf Prize in Physics, which he shared with Stephen Hawking for the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems,[6] and the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity\".[7][8][9][10][a] He is regarded as one of the greatest living physicists, mathematicians and scientists, and is particularly noted for the breadth and depth of his work in both natural and formal sciences.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Colchester, Essex, Roger Penrose is a son of medical doctor Margaret (Leathes) and psychiatrist and geneticist Lionel Penrose.[b] His paternal grandparents were J. Doyle Penrose, an Irish-born artist, and The Hon. Elizabeth Josephine, daughter of Alexander Peckover, 1st Baron Peckover; his maternal grandparents were physiologist John Beresford Leathes and Sonia Marie Natanson, a Russian Jew.[20][21][22][23] His uncle was artist Roland Penrose, whose son with American photographer Lee Miller is Antony Penrose.[24][25] Penrose is the brother of physicist Oliver Penrose, of geneticist Shirley Hodgson, and of chess Grandmaster Jonathan Penrose.[26][27] Their stepfather was the mathematician and computer scientist Max Newman.\n\n\nPenrose spent World War II as a child in Canada where his father worked in London, Ontario.[28] Penrose studied at University College School.[1] He attended and attained a first class degree in mathematics[26] from University College London.\n\n\nIn 1955, while a student, Penrose reintroduced the E. H. Moore generalised matrix inverse, also known as the Moore–Penrose inverse,[29] after it had been reinvented by Arne Bjerhammar in 1951.[30] Having started research under the professor of geometry and astronomy, Sir W. V. D. Hodge, Penrose finished his PhD at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1958, with a thesis on tensor methods in algebraic geometry[31] supervised by algebraist and geometer John A. Todd.[32] He devised and popularised the Penrose triangle in the 1950s in collaboration with his father, describing it as \"impossibility in its purest form\", and exchanged material with the artist M. C. Escher, whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it.[33][34] Escher's Waterfall, and Ascending and Descending were in turn inspired by Penrose.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Penrose triangle\nAs reviewer Manjit Kumar puts it:\n\n\n\n\n> As a student in 1954, Penrose was attending a conference in Amsterdam when by chance he came across an exhibition of Escher's work. Soon he was trying to conjure up impossible figures of his own and discovered the tribar – a triangle that looks like a real, solid three-dimensional object, but isn't. Together with his father, a physicist and mathematician, Penrose went on to design a staircase that simultaneously loops up and down. An article followed and a copy was sent to Escher. Completing a cyclical flow of creativity, the Dutch master of geometrical illusions was inspired to produce his two masterpieces.[36]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Research and career[edit]\n\n\nPenrose spent the academic year 1956–57 as an assistant lecturer at Bedford College, London and was then a research fellow at St John's College, Cambridge. During that three-year post, he married Joan Isabel Wedge, in 1959. Before the fellowship ended Penrose won a NATO Research Fellowship for 1959–61, first at Princeton and then at Syracuse University. Returning to the University of London, Penrose spent two years, 1961–63, as a researcher at King's College, London, before returning to the United States to spend the year 1963–64 as a visiting associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin.[37] He later held visiting positions at Yeshiva, Princeton, and Cornell during 1966–67 and 1969.\n\n\nIn 1964, while a reader at Birkbeck College, London, (and having had his attention drawn from pure mathematics to astrophysics by the cosmologist Dennis Sciama, then at Cambridge)[26] in the words of Kip Thorne of Caltech, \"Roger Penrose revolutionised the mathematical tools that we use to analyse the properties of spacetime\".[38][39] Until then, work on the curved geometry of general relativity had been confined to configurations with sufficiently high symmetry for Einstein's equations to be solvable explicitly, and there was doubt about whether such cases were typical. One approach to this issue was by the use of perturbation theory, as developed under the leadership of John Archibald Wheeler at Princeton.[40] The other, and more radically innovative, approach initiated by Penrose was to overlook the detailed geometrical structure of spacetime and instead concentrate attention just on the topology of the space, or at most its conformal structure, since it is the latter – as determined by the lay of the lightcones – that determines the trajectories of lightlike geodesics, and hence their causal relationships. The importance of Penrose's epoch-making paper \"Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities\"[41] was not its only result, summarised roughly as that if an object such as a dying star implodes beyond a certain point, then nothing can prevent the gravitational field getting so strong as to form some kind of singularity. It also showed a way to obtain similarly general conclusions in other contexts, notably that of the cosmological Big Bang, which he dealt with in collaboration with Dennis Sciama's most famous student, Stephen Hawking.[42][43][44]\n\n\n\n![](image)Predicted view from outside the event horizon of a black hole lit by a thin accretion disc\nIt was in the local context of gravitational collapse that the contribution of Penrose was most decisive, starting with his 1969 cosmic censorship conjecture,[45] to the effect that any ensuing singularities would be confined within a well-behaved event horizon surrounding a hidden space-time region for which Wheeler coined the term black hole, leaving a visible exterior region with strong but finite curvature, from which some of the gravitational energy may be extractable by what is known as the Penrose process, while accretion of surrounding matter may release further energy that can account for astrophysical phenomena such as quasars.[46][47][48]\n\n\nFollowing up his \"weak cosmic censorship hypothesis\", Penrose went on, in 1979, to formulate a stronger version called the \"strong censorship hypothesis\". Together with the Belinski–Khalatnikov–Lifshitz conjecture and issues of nonlinear stability, settling the censorship conjectures is one of the most important outstanding problems in general relativity. Also from 1979, dates Penrose's influential Weyl curvature hypothesis on the initial conditions of the observable part of the universe and the origin of the second law of thermodynamics.[49] Penrose and James Terrell independently realised that objects travelling near the speed of light will appear to undergo a peculiar skewing or rotation. This effect has come to be called the Terrell rotation or Penrose–Terrell rotation.[50][51]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Penrose tiling\nIn 1967, Penrose invented the twistor theory which maps geometric objects in Minkowski space into the 4-dimensional complex space with the metric signature (2,2).[52][53]\n\n\nPenrose is well known for his 1974 discovery of Penrose tilings, which are formed from two tiles that can only tile the plane nonperiodically, and are the first tilings to exhibit fivefold rotational symmetry. In 1984, such patterns were observed in the arrangement of atoms in quasicrystals.[54] Another noteworthy contribution is his 1971 invention of spin networks, which later came to form the geometry of spacetime in loop quantum gravity.[55] He was influential in popularizing what are commonly known as Penrose diagrams (causal diagrams).[56]\n\n\nIn 1983, Penrose was invited to teach at Rice University in Houston, by the then provost Bill Gordon. He worked there from 1983 to 1987.[57] His doctoral students have included, among others, Andrew Hodges,[58] Lane Hughston, Richard Jozsa, Claude LeBrun, John McNamara, Tristan Needham, Tim Poston,[59] Asghar Qadir, and Richard S. Ward.\n\n\nIn 2004, Penrose released *The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe*, a 1,099-page comprehensive guide to the Laws of Physics that includes an explanation of his own theory. The Penrose Interpretation predicts the relationship between quantum mechanics and general relativity, and proposes that a quantum state remains in superposition until the difference of space-time curvature attains a significant level.[60][61]\n\n\nPenrose is the Francis and Helen Pentz Distinguished Visiting Professor of Physics and Mathematics at Pennsylvania State University.[62]\n\n\n\n### An earlier universe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)WMAP image of the (extremely tiny) anisotropies in the cosmic background radiation\nIn 2010, Penrose reported possible evidence, based on concentric circles found in Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data of the cosmic microwave background sky, of an earlier universe existing before the Big Bang of our own present universe.[63] He mentions this evidence in the epilogue of his 2010 book *Cycles of Time*,[64] a book in which he presents his reasons, to do with Einstein's field equations, the Weyl curvature C, and the Weyl curvature hypothesis (WCH), that the transition at the Big Bang could have been smooth enough for a previous universe to survive it.[65][66] He made several conjectures about C and the WCH, some of which were subsequently proved by others, and he also popularized his conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC) theory.[67] In this theory, Penrose postulates that at the end of the universe all matter is eventually contained within black holes which subsequently evaporate via Hawking radiation. At this point, everything contained within the universe consists of photons which \"experience\" neither time nor space. There is essentially no difference between an infinitely large universe consisting only of photons and an infinitely small universe consisting only of photons. Therefore, a singularity for a Big Bang and an infinitely expanded universe are equivalent.[68]\n\n\nIn simple terms, Penrose believes that the singularity in Einstein's field equation at the Big Bang is only an apparent singularity, similar to the well-known apparent singularity at the event horizon of a black hole.[46] The latter singularity can be removed by a change of coordinate system, and Penrose proposes a different change of coordinate system that will remove the singularity at the big bang.[69] One implication of this is that the major events at the Big Bang can be understood without unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, and therefore we are not necessarily constrained by the Wheeler–DeWitt equation, which disrupts time.[70][71] Alternatively, one can use the Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations.[72]\n\n\n\n### Consciousness[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penrose at a conference\nPenrose has written books on the connection between fundamental physics and human (or animal) consciousness. In *The Emperor's New Mind* (1989), he argues that known laws of physics are inadequate to explain the phenomenon of consciousness.[73] Penrose proposes the characteristics this new physics may have and specifies the requirements for a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics (what he calls *correct quantum gravity*).[74] Penrose uses a variant of Turing's halting theorem to demonstrate that a system can be deterministic without being algorithmic. (For example, imagine a system with only two states, ON and OFF. If the system's state is ON when a given Turing machine halts and OFF when the Turing machine does not halt, then the system's state is completely determined by the machine; nevertheless, there is no algorithmic way to determine whether the Turing machine stops.)[75][76]\n\n\nPenrose believes that such deterministic yet non-algorithmic processes may come into play in the quantum mechanical wave function reduction, and may be harnessed by the brain. He argues that computers today are unable to have intelligence because they are algorithmically deterministic systems. He argues against the viewpoint that the rational processes of the mind are completely algorithmic and can thus be duplicated by a sufficiently complex computer.[77] This contrasts with supporters of strong artificial intelligence, who contend that thought can be simulated algorithmically. He bases this on claims that consciousness transcends formal logic because factors such as the insolubility of the halting problem and Gödel's incompleteness theorem prevent an algorithmically based system of logic from reproducing such traits of human intelligence as mathematical insight.[77][78] These claims were originally espoused by the philosopher John Lucas of Merton College, Oxford.[79] G. Hirase has paraphrased Penrose' argument and reinforced it.[80]\n\n\nThe Penrose–Lucas argument about the implications of Gödel's incompleteness theorem for computational theories of human intelligence has been criticised by mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers. Many experts in these fields assert that Penrose's argument fails, though different authors may choose different aspects of the argument to attack.[81] Marvin Minsky, a leading proponent of artificial intelligence, was particularly critical, stating that Penrose \"tries to show, in chapter after chapter, that human thought cannot be based on any known scientific principle.\" Minsky's position is exactly the opposite – he believed that humans are, in fact, machines, whose functioning, although complex, is fully explainable by current physics. Minsky maintained that \"one can carry that quest [for scientific explanation] too far by only seeking new basic principles instead of attacking the real detail. This is what I see in Penrose's quest for a new basic principle of physics that will account for consciousness.\"[82]\n\n\nPenrose responded to criticism of *The Emperor's New Mind* with his follow-up 1994 book *Shadows of the Mind*, and in 1997 with *The Large, the Small and the Human Mind*. In those works, he also combined his observations with those of anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff.[83]\n\n\nPenrose and Hameroff have argued that consciousness is the result of quantum gravity effects in microtubules, which they dubbed Orch-OR (orchestrated objective reduction). Max Tegmark, in a paper in *Physical Review E*,[84] calculated that the time scale of neuron firing and excitations in microtubules is slower than the decoherence time by a factor of at least 10,000,000,000. The reception of the paper is summed up by this statement in Tegmark's support: \"Physicists outside the fray, such as IBM's John A. Smolin, say the calculations confirm what they had suspected all along. 'We're not working with a brain that's near absolute zero. It's reasonably unlikely that the brain evolved quantum behavior'\".[85] Tegmark's paper has been widely cited by critics of the Penrose–Hameroff position.\n\n\n\nIn their reply to Tegmark's paper, also published in *Physical Review E*, the physicists Scott Hagan, Jack Tuszyński and Hameroff[86][87] claimed that Tegmark did not address the Orch-OR model, but instead a model of his own construction. This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24 nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch-OR. As a result, Hameroff's group claimed a decoherence time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark's, but still well short of the 25 ms required if the quantum processing in the theory was to be linked to the 40 Hz gamma synchrony, as Orch-OR suggested. To bridge this gap, the group made a series of proposals.[86] They supposed that the interiors of neurons could alternate between liquid and gel states. In the gel state, it was further hypothesized that the water electrical dipoles are oriented in the same direction, along the outer edge of the microtubule tubulin subunits.[86] Hameroff et al. proposed that this ordered water could screen any quantum coherence within the tubulin of the microtubules from the environment of the rest of the brain. Each tubulin also has a tail extending out from the microtubules, which is negatively charged, and therefore attracts positively charged ions. It is suggested that this could provide further screening. Further to this, there was a suggestion that the microtubules could be pumped into a coherent state by biochemical energy.[88]\n\n![](image)Penrose in the University of Santiago de Compostela to receive the Fonseca Prize Finally, he suggested that the configuration of the microtubule lattice might be suitable for quantum error correction, a means of holding together quantum coherence in the face of environmental interaction.[88]\n\n\nHameroff, in a lecture in part of a Google Tech[*clarification needed*] talks series exploring quantum biology, gave an overview of current research in the area, and responded to subsequent criticisms of the Orch-OR model.[89] In addition to this, a 2011 paper by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff published in the *Journal of Cosmology* gives an updated model of their Orch-OR theory, in light of criticisms, and discusses the place of consciousness within the universe.[90]\n\n\nPhillip Tetlow, although himself supportive of Penrose's views, acknowledges that Penrose's ideas about the human thought process are at present a minority view in scientific circles, citing Minsky's criticisms and quoting science journalist Charles Seife's description of Penrose as \"one of a handful of scientists\" who believe that the nature of consciousness suggests a quantum process.[85]\n\n\nIn January 2014, Hameroff and Penrose ventured that a discovery of quantum vibrations in microtubules by Anirban Bandyopadhyay of the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan[91] supports the hypothesis of Orch-OR theory.[92] A reviewed and updated version of the theory was published along with critical commentary and debate in the March 2014 issue of *Physics of Life Reviews*.[93]\n\n\n\n### Publications[edit]\n\n\nHis popular publications include:\n\n\n\n* *The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and The Laws of Physics* (1989)[94]\n* *Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness* (1994)[95]\n* *The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe* (2004)[96]\n* *Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe* (2010)[97]\n* *Fashion, Faith, and Fantasy in the New Physics of the Universe* (2016)[98]\n\n\nHis co-authored publications include:\n\n\n\n* *The Nature of Space and Time* (with Stephen Hawking) (1996)[99]\n* *The Large, the Small and the Human Mind* (with Abner Shimony, Nancy Cartwright, and Stephen Hawking) (1997)[100]\n* *White Mars: The Mind Set Free* (with Brian Aldiss) (1999)[101]\n\n\nHis academic books include:\n\n\n\n* *Techniques of Differential Topology in Relativity* (1972, ISBN 0-89871-005-7)\n* *Spinors and Space-Time: Volume 1, Two-Spinor Calculus and Relativistic Fields* (with Wolfgang Rindler, 1987) ISBN 0-521-33707-0 (paperback)\n* *Spinors and Space-Time: Volume 2, Spinor and Twistor Methods in Space-Time Geometry* (with Wolfgang Rindler, 1988) (reprint), ISBN 0-521-34786-6 (paperback)\n\n\nHis forewords to other books include:\n\n\n\n* Foreword to “The Map and the Territory: Exploring the foundations of science, thought and reality” by Shyam Wuppuluri and Francisco Antonio Doria.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1972. In 1975, Stephen Hawking and Penrose were jointly awarded the Eddington Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1985, he was awarded the Royal Society Royal Medal. Along with Stephen Hawking, he was awarded the prestigious Wolf Foundation Prize for Physics in 1988.\n\n\nIn 1989, Penrose was awarded the Dirac Medal and Prize of the British Institute of Physics. He was also made an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Physics (HonFInstP).[107]\n\n\nIn 1990, Penrose was awarded the Albert Einstein Medal for outstanding work related to the work of Albert Einstein by the Albert Einstein Society. In 1991, he was awarded the Naylor Prize of the London Mathematical Society. From 1992 to 1995, he served as President of the International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation.\nIn 1994, Penrose was knighted for services to science.[108] In the same year, he was also awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) by the University of Bath,[109] and became a member of Polish Academy of Sciences. In 1998, he was elected Foreign Associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences.[110] In 2000, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Merit (OM).[111]\n\n\nIn 2004, he was awarded the De Morgan Medal for his wide and original contributions to mathematical physics.[112] To quote the citation from the London Mathematical Society:\n\n\n\n\n> His deep work on General Relativity has been a major factor in our understanding of black holes. His development of Twistor Theory has produced a beautiful and productive approach to the classical equations of mathematical physics. His tilings of the plane underlie the newly discovered quasi-crystals.[113]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 2005, Penrose was awarded an honorary doctorate by Warsaw University and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium), and in 2006 by the University of York. In 2006, he also won the Dirac Medal given by the University of New South Wales. In 2008, Penrose was awarded the Copley Medal. He is also a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK and one of the patrons of the Oxford University Scientific Society.\n\n\nHe was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2011.[114] The same year, he was also awarded the Fonseca Prize by the University of Santiago de Compostela.\n\n\nIn 2012, Penrose was awarded the Richard R. Ernst Medal by ETH Zürich for his contributions to science and strengthening the connection between science and society. In 2015 Penrose was awarded an honorary doctorate by CINVESTAV-IPN (Mexico).[115]\n\n\nIn 2017, he was awarded the Commandino Medal at the Urbino University for his contributions to the history of science.\n\n\nIn 2020, Penrose was awarded one half of the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity, a half-share also going to Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy.[9]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nPenrose's first marriage was to American Joan Isabel Penrose (née Wedge), whom he married in 1959. They had three sons.[116][117] Penrose is now married to Vanessa Thomas, director of Academic Development at Cokethorpe School and former head of mathematics at Abingdon School.[118][119] They had one son.[120][118]\n\n\n\n### Religious views[edit]\n\n\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4 on 25 September 2010, Penrose stated, \"I'm not a believer myself. I don't believe in established religions of any kind.\"[121] He regards himself as an agnostic.[122] In the 1991 film *A Brief History of Time*, he also said, \"I think I would say that the universe has a purpose, it's not somehow just there by chance … some people, I think, take the view that the universe is just there and it runs along—it's a bit like it just sort of computes, and we happen somehow by accident to find ourselves in this thing. But I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful way of looking at the universe, I think that there is something much deeper about it.\"[123]\n\n\nPenrose is a patron of Humanists UK.[124]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of things named after Roger Penrose\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Anon (2017). \"Penrose, Sir Roger\". *Who's Who* (online Oxford University Press ed.).

He has received several prizes and awards, including the 1988 Wolf Prize in Physics, which he shared with Stephen Hawking for the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems,[6] and the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity\".[7][8][9][10][a] He is regarded as one of the greatest living physicists, mathematicians and scientists, and is particularly noted for the breadth and depth of his work in both natural and formal sciences.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Colchester, Essex, Roger Penrose is a son of medical doctor Margaret (Leathes) and psychiatrist and geneticist Lionel Penrose.[b] His paternal grandparents were J. Doyle Penrose, an Irish-born artist, and The Hon. Elizabeth Josephine, daughter of Alexander Peckover, 1st Baron Peckover; his maternal grandparents were physiologist John Beresford Leathes and Sonia Marie Natanson, a Russian Jew.[20][21][22][23] His uncle was artist Roland Penrose, whose son with American photographer Lee Miller is Antony Penrose.[24][25] Penrose is the brother of physicist Oliver Penrose, of geneticist Shirley Hodgson, and of chess Grandmaster Jonathan Penrose.[26][27] Their stepfather was the mathematician and computer scientist Max Newman.\n\n\nPenrose spent World War II as a child in Canada where his father worked in London, Ontario.[28] Penrose studied at University College School.[1] He attended and attained a first class degree in mathematics[26] from University College London.\n\n\nIn 1955, while a student, Penrose reintroduced the E. H. Moore generalised matrix inverse, also known as the Moore–Penrose inverse,[29] after it had been reinvented by Arne Bjerhammar in 1951.[30] Having started research under the professor of geometry and astronomy, Sir W. V. D. Hodge, Penrose finished his PhD at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1958, with a thesis on tensor methods in algebraic geometry[31] supervised by algebraist and geometer John A. Todd.[32] He devised and popularised the Penrose triangle in the 1950s in collaboration with his father, describing it as \"impossibility in its purest form\", and exchanged material with the artist M. C. Escher, whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it.[33][34] Escher's Waterfall, and Ascending and Descending were in turn inspired by Penrose.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Penrose triangle\nAs reviewer Manjit Kumar puts it:\n\n\n\n\n> As a student in 1954, Penrose was attending a conference in Amsterdam when by chance he came across an exhibition of Escher's work. Soon he was trying to conjure up impossible figures of his own and discovered the tribar – a triangle that looks like a real, solid three-dimensional object, but isn't. Together with his father, a physicist and mathematician, Penrose went on to design a staircase that simultaneously loops up and down. An article followed and a copy was sent to Escher. Completing a cyclical flow of creativity, the Dutch master of geometrical illusions was inspired to produce his two masterpieces.[36]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Research and career[edit]\n\n\nPenrose spent the academic year 1956–57 as an assistant lecturer at Bedford College, London and was then a research fellow at St John's College, Cambridge. During that three-year post, he married Joan Isabel Wedge, in 1959. Before the fellowship ended Penrose won a NATO Research Fellowship for 1959–61, first at Princeton and then at Syracuse University. Returning to the University of London, Penrose spent two years, 1961–63, as a researcher at King's College, London, before returning to the United States to spend the year 1963–64 as a visiting associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin.[37] He later held visiting positions at Yeshiva, Princeton, and Cornell during 1966–67 and 1969.\n\n\nIn 1964, while a reader at Birkbeck College, London, (and having had his attention drawn from pure mathematics to astrophysics by the cosmologist Dennis Sciama, then at Cambridge)[26] in the words of Kip Thorne of Caltech, \"Roger Penrose revolutionised the mathematical tools that we use to analyse the properties of spacetime\".[38][39] Until then, work on the curved geometry of general relativity had been confined to configurations with sufficiently high symmetry for Einstein's equations to be solvable explicitly, and there was doubt about whether such cases were typical. One approach to this issue was by the use of perturbation theory, as developed under the leadership of John Archibald Wheeler at Princeton.[40] The other, and more radically innovative, approach initiated by Penrose was to overlook the detailed geometrical structure of spacetime and instead concentrate attention just on the topology of the space, or at most its conformal structure, since it is the latter – as determined by the lay of the lightcones – that determines the trajectories of lightlike geodesics, and hence their causal relationships. The importance of Penrose's epoch-making paper \"Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities\"[41] was not its only result, summarised roughly as that if an object such as a dying star implodes beyond a certain point, then nothing can prevent the gravitational field getting so strong as to form some kind of singularity. It also showed a way to obtain similarly general conclusions in other contexts, notably that of the cosmological Big Bang, which he dealt with in collaboration with Dennis Sciama's most famous student, Stephen Hawking.[42][43][44]\n\n\n\n![](image)Predicted view from outside the event horizon of a black hole lit by a thin accretion disc\nIt was in the local context of gravitational collapse that the contribution of Penrose was most decisive, starting with his 1969 cosmic censorship conjecture,[45] to the effect that any ensuing singularities would be confined within a well-behaved event horizon surrounding a hidden space-time region for which Wheeler coined the term black hole, leaving a visible exterior region with strong but finite curvature, from which some of the gravitational energy may be extractable by what is known as the Penrose process, while accretion of surrounding matter may release further energy that can account for astrophysical phenomena such as quasars.[46][47][48]\n\n\nFollowing up his \"weak cosmic censorship hypothesis\", Penrose went on, in 1979, to formulate a stronger version called the \"strong censorship hypothesis\". Together with the Belinski–Khalatnikov–Lifshitz conjecture and issues of nonlinear stability, settling the censorship conjectures is one of the most important outstanding problems in general relativity. Also from 1979, dates Penrose's influential Weyl curvature hypothesis on the initial conditions of the observable part of the universe and the origin of the second law of thermodynamics.[49] Penrose and James Terrell independently realised that objects travelling near the speed of light will appear to undergo a peculiar skewing or rotation. This effect has come to be called the Terrell rotation or Penrose–Terrell rotation.[50][51]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Penrose tiling\nIn 1967, Penrose invented the twistor theory which maps geometric objects in Minkowski space into the 4-dimensional complex space with the metric signature (2,2).[52][53]\n\n\nPenrose is well known for his 1974 discovery of Penrose tilings, which are formed from two tiles that can only tile the plane nonperiodically, and are the first tilings to exhibit fivefold rotational symmetry. In 1984, such patterns were observed in the arrangement of atoms in quasicrystals.[54] Another noteworthy contribution is his 1971 invention of spin networks, which later came to form the geometry of spacetime in loop quantum gravity.[55] He was influential in popularizing what are commonly known as Penrose diagrams (causal diagrams).[56]\n\n\nIn 1983, Penrose was invited to teach at Rice University in Houston, by the then provost Bill Gordon. He worked there from 1983 to 1987.[57] His doctoral students have included, among others, Andrew Hodges,[58] Lane Hughston, Richard Jozsa, Claude LeBrun, John McNamara, Tristan Needham, Tim Poston,[59] Asghar Qadir, and Richard S. Ward.\n\n\nIn 2004, Penrose released *The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe*, a 1,099-page comprehensive guide to the Laws of Physics that includes an explanation of his own theory. The Penrose Interpretation predicts the relationship between quantum mechanics and general relativity, and proposes that a quantum state remains in superposition until the difference of space-time curvature attains a significant level.[60][61]\n\n\nPenrose is the Francis and Helen Pentz Distinguished Visiting Professor of Physics and Mathematics at Pennsylvania State University.[62]\n\n\n\n### An earlier universe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)WMAP image of the (extremely tiny) anisotropies in the cosmic background radiation\nIn 2010, Penrose reported possible evidence, based on concentric circles found in Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data of the cosmic microwave background sky, of an earlier universe existing before the Big Bang of our own present universe.[63] He mentions this evidence in the epilogue of his 2010 book *Cycles of Time*,[64] a book in which he presents his reasons, to do with Einstein's field equations, the Weyl curvature C, and the Weyl curvature hypothesis (WCH), that the transition at the Big Bang could have been smooth enough for a previous universe to survive it.[65][66] He made several conjectures about C and the WCH, some of which were subsequently proved by others, and he also popularized his conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC) theory.[67] In this theory, Penrose postulates that at the end of the universe all matter is eventually contained within black holes which subsequently evaporate via Hawking radiation. At this point, everything contained within the universe consists of photons which \"experience\" neither time nor space. There is essentially no difference between an infinitely large universe consisting only of photons and an infinitely small universe consisting only of photons. Therefore, a singularity for a Big Bang and an infinitely expanded universe are equivalent.[68]\n\n\nIn simple terms, Penrose believes that the singularity in Einstein's field equation at the Big Bang is only an apparent singularity, similar to the well-known apparent singularity at the event horizon of a black hole.[46] The latter singularity can be removed by a change of coordinate system, and Penrose proposes a different change of coordinate system that will remove the singularity at the big bang.[69] One implication of this is that the major events at the Big Bang can be understood without unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, and therefore we are not necessarily constrained by the Wheeler–DeWitt equation, which disrupts time.[70][71] Alternatively, one can use the Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations.[72]\n\n\n\n### Consciousness[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penrose at a conference\nPenrose has written books on the connection between fundamental physics and human (or animal) consciousness. In *The Emperor's New Mind* (1989), he argues that known laws of physics are inadequate to explain the phenomenon of consciousness.[73] Penrose proposes the characteristics this new physics may have and specifies the requirements for a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics (what he calls *correct quantum gravity*).[74] Penrose uses a variant of Turing's halting theorem to demonstrate that a system can be deterministic without being algorithmic. (For example, imagine a system with only two states, ON and OFF. If the system's state is ON when a given Turing machine halts and OFF when the Turing machine does not halt, then the system's state is completely determined by the machine; nevertheless, there is no algorithmic way to determine whether the Turing machine stops.)[75][76]\n\n\nPenrose believes that such deterministic yet non-algorithmic processes may come into play in the quantum mechanical wave function reduction, and may be harnessed by the brain. He argues that computers today are unable to have intelligence because they are algorithmically deterministic systems. He argues against the viewpoint that the rational processes of the mind are completely algorithmic and can thus be duplicated by a sufficiently complex computer.[77] This contrasts with supporters of strong artificial intelligence, who contend that thought can be simulated algorithmically. He bases this on claims that consciousness transcends formal logic because factors such as the insolubility of the halting problem and Gödel's incompleteness theorem prevent an algorithmically based system of logic from reproducing such traits of human intelligence as mathematical insight.[77][78] These claims were originally espoused by the philosopher John Lucas of Merton College, Oxford.[79] G. Hirase has paraphrased Penrose' argument and reinforced it.[80]\n\n\nThe Penrose–Lucas argument about the implications of Gödel's incompleteness theorem for computational theories of human intelligence has been criticised by mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers. Many experts in these fields assert that Penrose's argument fails, though different authors may choose different aspects of the argument to attack.[81] Marvin Minsky, a leading proponent of artificial intelligence, was particularly critical, stating that Penrose \"tries to show, in chapter after chapter, that human thought cannot be based on any known scientific principle.\" Minsky's position is exactly the opposite – he believed that humans are, in fact, machines, whose functioning, although complex, is fully explainable by current physics. Minsky maintained that \"one can carry that quest [for scientific explanation] too far by only seeking new basic principles instead of attacking the real detail. This is what I see in Penrose's quest for a new basic principle of physics that will account for consciousness.\"[82]\n\n\nPenrose responded to criticism of *The Emperor's New Mind* with his follow-up 1994 book *Shadows of the Mind*, and in 1997 with *The Large, the Small and the Human Mind*. In those works, he also combined his observations with those of anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff.[83]\n\n\nPenrose and Hameroff have argued that consciousness is the result of quantum gravity effects in microtubules, which they dubbed Orch-OR (orchestrated objective reduction). Max Tegmark, in a paper in *Physical Review E*,[84] calculated that the time scale of neuron firing and excitations in microtubules is slower than the decoherence time by a factor of at least 10,000,000,000. The reception of the paper is summed up by this statement in Tegmark's support: \"Physicists outside the fray, such as IBM's John A. Smolin, say the calculations confirm what they had suspected all along. 'We're not working with a brain that's near absolute zero. It's reasonably unlikely that the brain evolved quantum behavior'\".[85] Tegmark's paper has been widely cited by critics of the Penrose–Hameroff position.\n\n\n\nIn their reply to Tegmark's paper, also published in *Physical Review E*, the physicists Scott Hagan, Jack Tuszyński and Hameroff[86][87] claimed that Tegmark did not address the Orch-OR model, but instead a model of his own construction. This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24 nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch-OR. As a result, Hameroff's group claimed a decoherence time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark's, but still well short of the 25 ms required if the quantum processing in the theory was to be linked to the 40 Hz gamma synchrony, as Orch-OR suggested. To bridge this gap, the group made a series of proposals.[86] They supposed that the interiors of neurons could alternate between liquid and gel states. In the gel state, it was further hypothesized that the water electrical dipoles are oriented in the same direction, along the outer edge of the microtubule tubulin subunits.[86] Hameroff et al. proposed that this ordered water could screen any quantum coherence within the tubulin of the microtubules from the environment of the rest of the brain. Each tubulin also has a tail extending out from the microtubules, which is negatively charged, and therefore attracts positively charged ions. It is suggested that this could provide further screening. Further to this, there was a suggestion that the microtubules could be pumped into a coherent state by biochemical energy.[88]\n\n![](image)Penrose in the University of Santiago de Compostela to receive the Fonseca Prize Finally, he suggested that the configuration of the microtubule lattice might be suitable for quantum error correction, a means of holding together quantum coherence in the face of environmental interaction.[88]\n\n\nHameroff, in a lecture in part of a Google Tech[*clarification needed*] talks series exploring quantum biology, gave an overview of current research in the area, and responded to subsequent criticisms of the Orch-OR model.[89] In addition to this, a 2011 paper by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff published in the *Journal of Cosmology* gives an updated model of their Orch-OR theory, in light of criticisms, and discusses the place of consciousness within the universe.[90]\n\n\nPhillip Tetlow, although himself supportive of Penrose's views, acknowledges that Penrose's ideas about the human thought process are at present a minority view in scientific circles, citing Minsky's criticisms and quoting science journalist Charles Seife's description of Penrose as \"one of a handful of scientists\" who believe that the nature of consciousness suggests a quantum process.[85]\n\n\nIn January 2014, Hameroff and Penrose ventured that a discovery of quantum vibrations in microtubules by Anirban Bandyopadhyay of the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan[91] supports the hypothesis of Orch-OR theory.[92] A reviewed and updated version of the theory was published along with critical commentary and debate in the March 2014 issue of *Physics of Life Reviews*.[93]\n\n\n\n### Publications[edit]\n\n\nHis popular publications include:\n\n\n\n* *The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and The Laws of Physics* (1989)[94]\n* *Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness* (1994)[95]\n* *The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe* (2004)[96]\n* *Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe* (2010)[97]\n* *Fashion, Faith, and Fantasy in the New Physics of the Universe* (2016)[98]\n\n\nHis co-authored publications include:\n\n\n\n* *The Nature of Space and Time* (with Stephen Hawking) (1996)[99]\n* *The Large, the Small and the Human Mind* (with Abner Shimony, Nancy Cartwright, and Stephen Hawking) (1997)[100]\n* *White Mars: The Mind Set Free* (with Brian Aldiss) (1999)[101]\n\n\nHis academic books include:\n\n\n\n* *Techniques of Differential Topology in Relativity* (1972, ISBN 0-89871-005-7)\n* *Spinors and Space-Time: Volume 1, Two-Spinor Calculus and Relativistic Fields* (with Wolfgang Rindler, 1987) ISBN 0-521-33707-0 (paperback)\n* *Spinors and Space-Time: Volume 2, Spinor and Twistor Methods in Space-Time Geometry* (with Wolfgang Rindler, 1988) (reprint), ISBN 0-521-34786-6 (paperback)\n\n\nHis forewords to other books include:\n\n\n\n* Foreword to “The Map and the Territory: Exploring the foundations of science, thought and reality” by Shyam Wuppuluri and Francisco Antonio Doria.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1972. In 1975, Stephen Hawking and Penrose were jointly awarded the Eddington Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1985, he was awarded the Royal Society Royal Medal. Along with Stephen Hawking, he was awarded the prestigious Wolf Foundation Prize for Physics in 1988.\n\n\nIn 1989, Penrose was awarded the Dirac Medal and Prize of the British Institute of Physics. He was also made an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Physics (HonFInstP).[107]\n\n\nIn 1990, Penrose was awarded the Albert Einstein Medal for outstanding work related to the work of Albert Einstein by the Albert Einstein Society. In 1991, he was awarded the Naylor Prize of the London Mathematical Society. From 1992 to 1995, he served as President of the International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation.\nIn 1994, Penrose was knighted for services to science.[108] In the same year, he was also awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) by the University of Bath,[109] and became a member of Polish Academy of Sciences. In 1998, he was elected Foreign Associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences.[110] In 2000, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Merit (OM).[111]\n\n\nIn 2004, he was awarded the De Morgan Medal for his wide and original contributions to mathematical physics.[112] To quote the citation from the London Mathematical Society:\n\n\n\n\n> His deep work on General Relativity has been a major factor in our understanding of black holes. His development of Twistor Theory has produced a beautiful and productive approach to the classical equations of mathematical physics. His tilings of the plane underlie the newly discovered quasi-crystals.[113]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 2005, Penrose was awarded an honorary doctorate by Warsaw University and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium), and in 2006 by the University of York. In 2006, he also won the Dirac Medal given by the University of New South Wales. In 2008, Penrose was awarded the Copley Medal. He is also a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK and one of the patrons of the Oxford University Scientific Society.\n\n\nHe was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2011.[114] The same year, he was also awarded the Fonseca Prize by the University of Santiago de Compostela.\n\n\nIn 2012, Penrose was awarded the Richard R. Ernst Medal by ETH Zürich for his contributions to science and strengthening the connection between science and society. In 2015 Penrose was awarded an honorary doctorate by CINVESTAV-IPN (Mexico).[115]\n\n\nIn 2017, he was awarded the Commandino Medal at the Urbino University for his contributions to the history of science.\n\n\nIn 2020, Penrose was awarded one half of the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity, a half-share also going to Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy.[9]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nPenrose's first marriage was to American Joan Isabel Penrose (née Wedge), whom he married in 1959. They had three sons.[116][117] Penrose is now married to Vanessa Thomas, director of Academic Development at Cokethorpe School and former head of mathematics at Abingdon School.[118][119] They had one son.[120][118]\n\n\n\n### Religious views[edit]\n\n\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4 on 25 September 2010, Penrose stated, \"I'm not a believer myself. I don't believe in established religions of any kind.\"[121] He regards himself as an agnostic.[122] In the 1991 film *A Brief History of Time*, he also said, \"I think I would say that the universe has a purpose, it's not somehow just there by chance … some people, I think, take the view that the universe is just there and it runs along—it's a bit like it just sort of computes, and we happen somehow by accident to find ourselves in this thing. But I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful way of looking at the universe, I think that there is something much deeper about it.\"[123]\n\n\nPenrose is a patron of Humanists UK.[124]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of things named after Roger Penrose\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Anon (2017). \"Penrose, Sir Roger\". *Who's Who* (online Oxford University Press ed.).

He was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy\", which he shared with Andrea Ghez and Roger Penrose.[2][3] In a 2021 interview given to Federal University of Pará in Brazil, Genzel recalls his journey as a physicist; the influence of his father, Ludwig Genzel [de]; his experiences working with Charles H. Townes; and more.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\nGenzel was born in Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Germany, the son of Eva-Maria Genzel and Ludwig Genzel, a professor of solid state physics (1922–2003). He studied physics at the University of Freiburg and the University of Bonn, graduating in 1978 with a PhD in radioastronomy which he prepared at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy.[6] Subsequently he worked at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was a Miller Fellow from 1980 until 1982, and also Associate and finally Full Professor in the Department of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley from 1981. In 1986, he left Berkeley to become a director at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching and Scientific Member of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft.[7] During that time he also lectured at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, where he has been Honorary Professor since 1988.[6] From 1999 to 2016, he also had a part-time joint appointment as Full Professor at the University of California, Berkeley.[6][7] Additional activities include sitting on the selection committee for the Shaw Prize in astronomy.[8]\n\n\n\n## Work[edit]\n\n\nReinhard Genzel studies infrared- and submillimetre astronomy. He and his group are\nactive in developing ground- and space-based instruments for astronomy. They used these to track the motions of stars at the centre of the Milky Way, around Sagittarius A\\*, and show that they were orbiting a very massive object, now known to be a black hole.[9] Genzel is also active in studies of the formation and evolution of galaxies.[7]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Reinhard Genzel *et al.* reported that star S2 orbiting Sgr A\\* had been recorded at 7,650 km/s or 2.55% the speed of light leading up to the pericentre approach in May 2018 at about 120 AU ≈ 1400 Schwarzschild radii from Sgr A\\*. This allowed them to test the redshift predicted by general relativity at relativistic velocities, finding additional confirmation of the theory.[10][11]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes, 1973–1975[12]\n* Miller Research Fellowship, 1980–1982[13]\n* Otto Hahn Medal, Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, 1980[13]\n* Presidential Young Investigator Award, National Science Foundation, 1984[13]\n* Newton Lacy Pierce Prize, American Astronomical Society, 1986[13]\n* Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, 1990[13]\n* De Vaucouleurs Medal, University of Texas, 2000[13]\n* Prix Jules Janssen, Société astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society), 2000[13]\n* Stern Gerlach Medal for experimental physics, Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, 2003[13]\n* Balzan Prize for Infrared Astronomy, 2003[13]\n* Albert Einstein Medal, 2007[14]\n* Shaw Prize, 2008[15]\n* \"Galileo 2000\" Prize, 2009[13]\n* Karl Schwarzschild Medal, Deutsche Astronomische Gesellschaft, 2011[16]\n* Crafoord Prize, Royal Swedish Academy, 2012[17]\n* Tycho Brahe Prize, European Astronomical Society, 2012[18]\n* Pour le Mérite, 2013[19]\n* Harvey Prize, Technion Institute, Israel, 2014[20]\n* Herschel Medal, Royal Astronomical Society, 2014[21]\n* Nobel Prize in Physics, 2020[2]\n\n\n## Membership of scientific societies[edit]\n\n\n* Fellow of the American Physical Society, 1985[19]\n* Foreign member of the Académie des Sciences (Institut de France), 1998[19]\n* Foreign member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, 2000[22]\n* Member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, 2002[23]\n* Senior member of the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 2003[24]\n* Foreign member of the Royal Spanish Academy of Sciences, 2011[13]\n* Foreign member of the Royal Society of London, 2012[1]\n* Member of the Pontifical Academy, 2020[25]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** http://royalsociety.org/people/reinhard-genzel/ Professor Reinhard Genzel ForMemRS\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Press release: The Nobel Prize in Physics 2020\".

He was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy\", which he shared with Andrea Ghez and Roger Penrose.[2][3] In a 2021 interview given to Federal University of Pará in Brazil, Genzel recalls his journey as a physicist; the influence of his father, Ludwig Genzel [de]; his experiences working with Charles H. Townes; and more.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\nGenzel was born in Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Germany, the son of Eva-Maria Genzel and Ludwig Genzel, a professor of solid state physics (1922–2003). He studied physics at the University of Freiburg and the University of Bonn, graduating in 1978 with a PhD in radioastronomy which he prepared at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy.[6] Subsequently he worked at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was a Miller Fellow from 1980 until 1982, and also Associate and finally Full Professor in the Department of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley from 1981. In 1986, he left Berkeley to become a director at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching and Scientific Member of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft.[7] During that time he also lectured at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, where he has been Honorary Professor since 1988.[6] From 1999 to 2016, he also had a part-time joint appointment as Full Professor at the University of California, Berkeley.[6][7] Additional activities include sitting on the selection committee for the Shaw Prize in astronomy.[8]\n\n\n\n## Work[edit]\n\n\nReinhard Genzel studies infrared- and submillimetre astronomy. He and his group are\nactive in developing ground- and space-based instruments for astronomy. They used these to track the motions of stars at the centre of the Milky Way, around Sagittarius A\\*, and show that they were orbiting a very massive object, now known to be a black hole.[9] Genzel is also active in studies of the formation and evolution of galaxies.[7]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Reinhard Genzel *et al.* reported that star S2 orbiting Sgr A\\* had been recorded at 7,650 km/s or 2.55% the speed of light leading up to the pericentre approach in May 2018 at about 120 AU ≈ 1400 Schwarzschild radii from Sgr A\\*. This allowed them to test the redshift predicted by general relativity at relativistic velocities, finding additional confirmation of the theory.[10][11]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes, 1973–1975[12]\n* Miller Research Fellowship, 1980–1982[13]\n* Otto Hahn Medal, Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, 1980[13]\n* Presidential Young Investigator Award, National Science Foundation, 1984[13]\n* Newton Lacy Pierce Prize, American Astronomical Society, 1986[13]\n* Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, 1990[13]\n* De Vaucouleurs Medal, University of Texas, 2000[13]\n* Prix Jules Janssen, Société astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society), 2000[13]\n* Stern Gerlach Medal for experimental physics, Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, 2003[13]\n* Balzan Prize for Infrared Astronomy, 2003[13]\n* Albert Einstein Medal, 2007[14]\n* Shaw Prize, 2008[15]\n* \"Galileo 2000\" Prize, 2009[13]\n* Karl Schwarzschild Medal, Deutsche Astronomische Gesellschaft, 2011[16]\n* Crafoord Prize, Royal Swedish Academy, 2012[17]\n* Tycho Brahe Prize, European Astronomical Society, 2012[18]\n* Pour le Mérite, 2013[19]\n* Harvey Prize, Technion Institute, Israel, 2014[20]\n* Herschel Medal, Royal Astronomical Society, 2014[21]\n* Nobel Prize in Physics, 2020[2]\n\n\n## Membership of scientific societies[edit]\n\n\n* Fellow of the American Physical Society, 1985[19]\n* Foreign member of the Académie des Sciences (Institut de France), 1998[19]\n* Foreign member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, 2000[22]\n* Member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, 2002[23]\n* Senior member of the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 2003[24]\n* Foreign member of the Royal Spanish Academy of Sciences, 2011[13]\n* Foreign member of the Royal Society of London, 2012[1]\n* Member of the Pontifical Academy, 2020[25]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** http://royalsociety.org/people/reinhard-genzel/ Professor Reinhard Genzel ForMemRS\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Press release: The Nobel Prize in Physics 2020\".

He then taught for three years in Cameroon as a replacement for then compulsory military service.[9]\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, while working on his doctorat d'État (habilitation thesis),[10] he performed the Bell test experiments that showed that Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen's putative reductio ad absurdum of quantum mechanics, namely that it implied 'ghostly action at a distance', did in fact appear to be realized when two particles were separated by an arbitrarily large distance (see EPR paradox and Aspect's experiment). A correlation between the particles' wave functions remains, as long as they were once part of the same undisturbed wave function before one of the child particles was measured. He defended his doctorat d'État in 1983 at Université Paris-Sud (today part of Paris-Saclay University).[11]\n\n\nAspect received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2008.[12]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nAspect's experiments, following the first experiment of Stuart Freedman and John Clauser in 1972, were considered to provide further support to the thesis that Bell's inequalities are violated in its CHSH version, in particular by closing a form of the locality loophole. However, his results were not completely conclusive since there were loopholes that allowed for alternative explanations that comply with local realism.[13]\n\n\nAfter his work on Bell's inequalities, Aspect turned toward studies of laser cooling of neutral atoms, and Bose–Einstein condensates at the Kastler-Brossel Laboratory.[14]\n\n\n\n![Picture of Alain Aspect](image)Aspect at the École Polytechnique (Polytechnic Institute of Paris).\nAspect was deputy director of the French \"grande école\" École supérieure d'optique until 1994. He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences and French Academy of Technologies, and a professor at the École Polytechnique.[2]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alain Aspect at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, 2013.\n![](image)Alain Aspect at Institut d'Optique, October 4, 2022.\n## Distinctions[edit]\n\n\nAspect was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2015.[15] His certificate of election reads \n\n\n> For his fundamental experiments in quantum optics and atomic physics. Alain Aspect was the first to exclude subluminal communication between the measurement stations in experimental demonstrations that quantum mechanics invalidates separable hidden-variable theories and the first to demonstrate experimentally the wave–particle duality of single photons. He co-invented the technique of velocity-selective coherent population trapping, was the first to compare the Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations of fermions and bosons under the same conditions, and the first to demonstrate Anderson localization in an ultra-cold atom system. His experiments illuminate fundamental aspects of the quantum-mechanical behaviour of single photons, photon pairs and atoms.[1]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 2005 he was awarded the gold medal of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique, where he is Research Director. The 2010 Wolf Prize in physics was awarded to Aspect, Anton Zeilinger and John Clauser. In 2013 Aspect was awarded both the Niels Bohr International Gold Medal and the UNESCO Niels Bohr Medal. In 2011, he was assigned the Medal of the City of Paris. In 2013, he was also awarded the Balzan Prize for Quantum Information Processing and Communication. In 2014, he was named Officer of the Legion of Honour.[16]\n\n\nAsteroid 33163 Alainaspect, discovered by astronomers at Caussols in 1998, was named after him.[17] The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 8 November 2019 (M.P.C. 118220).[18]\n\n\nAspect was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics alongside John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger \"for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell's inequalities and pioneering quantum information science\".[8]\n\n\n\n## Honours and awards[edit]\n\n\nAccolades received by Aspect include the following:[19][20]\n\n\n\n### Honours[edit]\n\n\n* 2022 : Commander of the Legion of Honour.\n* 2014 : Officier of the Legion of Honour.\n* 2011 : Officier of the National Order of Merit.\n* 2011 : Commander of the Palmes académiques.\n* 2011 : Medal of the City of Paris.\n* 2005 : Knight of the Legion of Honour.\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alain Aspect at the Balzan Prize ceremony (Bern, November 15, 2013).\n* 2022: Nobel Prize in Physics (with John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger)\n* 2013: Balzan Prize\n* 2013: Niels Bohr International Gold Medal\n* 2013: UNESCO Niels Bohr Medal\n* 2013: Frederic Ives Medal / Quinn Prize - Awards\n* 2012: Albert Einstein Medal\n* 2011: Herbert Walther award\n* 2010: Wolf Prize\n* 2005: CNRS Gold Medal\n* 1999: Gay-Lussac–Humboldt Prize\n* 1991: Fernand Holweck Medal and Prize\n* 1987: International Commission for Optics Award\n* 1985: Commonwealth Award for Science and Invention\n* 1983: *Prix Servant*\n\n\n### Acknowledgement[edit]\n\n\n* Member of the Academia Europaea\n* Member of the French Academy of Sciences\n* Member of the French Academy of Technologies\n* Foreign Member of the Royal Society\n* Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences\n* Associate Member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium\n* Corresponding member abroad of the Austrian Academy of Sciences\n* Fellow of Optica\n\n\n### Honorary degrees[edit]\n\n\n* 2006: Université de Montréal\n* 2008: Australian National University\n* 2008: Heriot-Watt University\n* 2010: University of Glasgow\n* 2011: University of Haifa\n* 2014: University of Waterloo\n* 2018: City University of Hong Kong\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Certificate of Election: EC/2015/48: Aspect, Alain\".

He then taught for three years in Cameroon as a replacement for then compulsory military service.[9]\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, while working on his doctorat d'État (habilitation thesis),[10] he performed the Bell test experiments that showed that Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen's putative reductio ad absurdum of quantum mechanics, namely that it implied 'ghostly action at a distance', did in fact appear to be realized when two particles were separated by an arbitrarily large distance (see EPR paradox and Aspect's experiment). A correlation between the particles' wave functions remains, as long as they were once part of the same undisturbed wave function before one of the child particles was measured. He defended his doctorat d'État in 1983 at Université Paris-Sud (today part of Paris-Saclay University).[11]\n\n\nAspect received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2008.[12]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nAspect's experiments, following the first experiment of Stuart Freedman and John Clauser in 1972, were considered to provide further support to the thesis that Bell's inequalities are violated in its CHSH version, in particular by closing a form of the locality loophole. However, his results were not completely conclusive since there were loopholes that allowed for alternative explanations that comply with local realism.[13]\n\n\nAfter his work on Bell's inequalities, Aspect turned toward studies of laser cooling of neutral atoms, and Bose–Einstein condensates at the Kastler-Brossel Laboratory.[14]\n\n\n\n![Picture of Alain Aspect](image)Aspect at the École Polytechnique (Polytechnic Institute of Paris).\nAspect was deputy director of the French \"grande école\" École supérieure d'optique until 1994. He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences and French Academy of Technologies, and a professor at the École Polytechnique.[2]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alain Aspect at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, 2013.\n![](image)Alain Aspect at Institut d'Optique, October 4, 2022.\n## Distinctions[edit]\n\n\nAspect was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2015.[15] His certificate of election reads \n\n\n> For his fundamental experiments in quantum optics and atomic physics. Alain Aspect was the first to exclude subluminal communication between the measurement stations in experimental demonstrations that quantum mechanics invalidates separable hidden-variable theories and the first to demonstrate experimentally the wave–particle duality of single photons. He co-invented the technique of velocity-selective coherent population trapping, was the first to compare the Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations of fermions and bosons under the same conditions, and the first to demonstrate Anderson localization in an ultra-cold atom system. His experiments illuminate fundamental aspects of the quantum-mechanical behaviour of single photons, photon pairs and atoms.[1]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 2005 he was awarded the gold medal of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique, where he is Research Director. The 2010 Wolf Prize in physics was awarded to Aspect, Anton Zeilinger and John Clauser. In 2013 Aspect was awarded both the Niels Bohr International Gold Medal and the UNESCO Niels Bohr Medal. In 2011, he was assigned the Medal of the City of Paris. In 2013, he was also awarded the Balzan Prize for Quantum Information Processing and Communication. In 2014, he was named Officer of the Legion of Honour.[16]\n\n\nAsteroid 33163 Alainaspect, discovered by astronomers at Caussols in 1998, was named after him.[17] The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 8 November 2019 (M.P.C. 118220).[18]\n\n\nAspect was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics alongside John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger \"for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell's inequalities and pioneering quantum information science\".[8]\n\n\n\n## Honours and awards[edit]\n\n\nAccolades received by Aspect include the following:[19][20]\n\n\n\n### Honours[edit]\n\n\n* 2022 : Commander of the Legion of Honour.\n* 2014 : Officier of the Legion of Honour.\n* 2011 : Officier of the National Order of Merit.\n* 2011 : Commander of the Palmes académiques.\n* 2011 : Medal of the City of Paris.\n* 2005 : Knight of the Legion of Honour.\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alain Aspect at the Balzan Prize ceremony (Bern, November 15, 2013).\n* 2022: Nobel Prize in Physics (with John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger)\n* 2013: Balzan Prize\n* 2013: Niels Bohr International Gold Medal\n* 2013: UNESCO Niels Bohr Medal\n* 2013: Frederic Ives Medal / Quinn Prize - Awards\n* 2012: Albert Einstein Medal\n* 2011: Herbert Walther award\n* 2010: Wolf Prize\n* 2005: CNRS Gold Medal\n* 1999: Gay-Lussac–Humboldt Prize\n* 1991: Fernand Holweck Medal and Prize\n* 1987: International Commission for Optics Award\n* 1985: Commonwealth Award for Science and Invention\n* 1983: *Prix Servant*\n\n\n### Acknowledgement[edit]\n\n\n* Member of the Academia Europaea\n* Member of the French Academy of Sciences\n* Member of the French Academy of Technologies\n* Foreign Member of the Royal Society\n* Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences\n* Associate Member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium\n* Corresponding member abroad of the Austrian Academy of Sciences\n* Fellow of Optica\n\n\n### Honorary degrees[edit]\n\n\n* 2006: Université de Montréal\n* 2008: Australian National University\n* 2008: Heriot-Watt University\n* 2010: University of Glasgow\n* 2011: University of Haifa\n* 2014: University of Waterloo\n* 2018: City University of Hong Kong\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Certificate of Election: EC/2015/48: Aspect, Alain\".

His father, Francis H. Clauser, was a professor of aeronautical engineering who founded and chaired the aeronautics department at Johns Hopkins University. He later served as the Clark Blanchard Millikan Professor of Engineering at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).[3] His mother, Catharine McMillan, was the humanities librarian at Caltech and sister of 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry laureate Edwin McMillan.[4]\n\n\nHe received a bachelor of science in physics from Caltech in 1964, where he was a member of Dabney House.[5] He received a master of arts in physics in 1966 and a doctor of philosophy in physics in 1969 from Columbia University[1] under the direction of Patrick Thaddeus.[6][7]\n\n\nFrom 1969 to 1975, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In 1972, working with Berkeley graduate student Stuart Freedman, he carried out the first experimental test of the CHSH-Bell's theorem predictions. This was the first experimental observation of a violation of a Bell inequality.[1][8] In 1974, working with Michael Horne, he first showed that a generalization of Bell's Theorem provides severe constraints for all local realistic theories of nature (a.k.a. objective local theories). That work introduced the Clauser–Horne (CH) inequality as the first fully general experimental requirement set by local realism. It also introduced the \"CH no-enhancement assumption\", whereupon the CH inequality reduces to the CHSH inequality, and whereupon associated experimental tests also constrain local realism. Also in 1974 he made the first observation of sub-Poissonian statistics for light (via a violation of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality for classical electromagnetic fields), and thereby, for the first time, demonstrated an unambiguous particle-like character for photons. \n\n\nClauser worked as a research physicist mainly at Lawrence Livermore and Berkeley from 1975 to 1997. In 1976 he carried out the world's second experimental test of the CHSH-Bell's Theorem predictions.[9]\n\n\nClauser was awarded the Wolf Prize in Physics in 2010 together with Alain Aspect and Anton Zeilinger. The three were also jointly awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics.[10]\n\n\n\n### Climate change denial[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Clauser joined the board of the CO2 Coalition, a climate change denial organization.[11]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Clauser called himself a \"climate denier\" at an event organized by the Deposit of Faith Coalition, a group of Catholic organizations. He believes that Earth's temperature is primarily determined by cloud cover instead of, as stated by the scientific consensus on climate change,[12] carbon dioxide emissions. He has concluded that clouds have a net cooling effect on the planet, and stated \"there is no climate crisis.\"[13] Low-altitude, thick clouds do have a net cooling effect, in contrast with high-altitude, thin ones,[14] but there is observational evidence that the current cloud feedback is positive, not negative.[15]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* *Epistemological Letters*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"John F.

His father, Francis H. Clauser, was a professor of aeronautical engineering who founded and chaired the aeronautics department at Johns Hopkins University. He later served as the Clark Blanchard Millikan Professor of Engineering at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).[3] His mother, Catharine McMillan, was the humanities librarian at Caltech and sister of 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry laureate Edwin McMillan.[4]\n\n\nHe received a bachelor of science in physics from Caltech in 1964, where he was a member of Dabney House.[5] He received a master of arts in physics in 1966 and a doctor of philosophy in physics in 1969 from Columbia University[1] under the direction of Patrick Thaddeus.[6][7]\n\n\nFrom 1969 to 1975, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

He studied physics at the University of Vienna from 1963 to 1971.[12] He received a doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1971, with a thesis on \"Neutron depolarization measurements on a Dy-single crystal\" under Helmut Rauch. He qualified as a university lecturer (habilitation) at the Vienna University of Technology in 1979.[13][14][15]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1970s, Zeilinger worked at the Vienna Atominstitut as a research assistant and later as an associate researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Neutron Diffraction Laboratory until 1979, when he accepted the position of assistant professor at the same Atominstitut. That year he qualified as a university professor. at the Vienna University of Technology.[12] [16]\n\n\nIn 1981 Zeilinger returned to MIT in 1981 as an associate professor on the physics faculty until 1983. Between 1980 and 1990 he worked as a professor at the Vienna University of Technology, the Technical University of Munich, the University of Innsbruck and the University of Vienna.[17]\n\n\nHe was also, between 2004 and 2013, the scientific director of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information in Vienna between 2004 and 2013.[12] Zeilinger became professor emeritus at the University of Vienna in 2013.[12] He was president of the Austrian Academy of Sciences from 2013 till 2022.[18]\n\n\nSince 2006, Zeilinger is the vice chairman of the board of trustees of the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, an ambitious project initiated by Zeilinger's proposal. In 2009, he founded the International Academy Traunkirchen,[19] which is dedicated to the support of gifted students in science and technology. He is a fan of the *Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy* by Douglas Adams, going so far as to name his sailboat 42.[20]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n### Quantum teleportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Quantum teleportation\n\nMost widely known is his first realization of quantum teleportation of an independent qubit.[21] He later expanded this work to developing a source for freely propagating teleported qubits[22] and quantum teleportation over 144 kilometers between two Canary Islands.[23] Quantum teleportation is an essential concept in many quantum information protocols. Besides its role for the transfer of quantum information, it is also considered as an important possible mechanism for building gates within quantum computers.[24]\n\n\n\n### Entanglement swapping – teleportation of entanglement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Entanglement swapping\n\nEntanglement swapping is the teleportation of an entangled state. After its proposal,[25] entanglement swapping has first been realized experimentally by Zeilinger's group in 1998.[26] It was then applied to carry out a delayed-choice entanglement swapping test.[27]\n\n\n\n### Entanglement beyond two qubits – GHZ-states and their realizations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anton Zeilinger holding a sculpture by Julian Voss-Andreae, photo by J. Godany\nAnton Zeilinger contributed to the opening up of the field of multi-particle entanglement.[28] In 1990, he was the first with Daniel Greenberger and Michael Horne to work on entanglement of more than two qubits.[29] The resulting GHZ theorem (see Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state) is fundamental for quantum physics, as it provides the most succinct contradiction between local realism and the predictions of quantum mechanics.[30]\n\n\nGHZ states were the first instances of multi-particle entanglement ever investigated.[31]\n\n\nFinally, in 1999, he succeeded in providing the first experimental evidence of entanglement beyond two particles[32] and also the first test of quantum nonlocality for GHZ states.[33]\n\n\n\n### Quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum computation[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998 (published in 2000), his group was the first to implement quantum cryptography with entangled photons.[34][35]\n\n\n  \n\nHe then also applied quantum entanglement to optical quantum computation, where in 2005,[36] he performed the first implementation of one-way quantum computation. This is a protocol based on quantum measurement as proposed by Knill, Laflamme and Milburn.[37]\n\n\nThe experiments of Zeilinger and his group on the distribution of entanglement over large distances began with both free-space and fiber-based quantum communication and teleportation between laboratories located on the different sides of the river Danube.[38] This was then extended to larger distances across the city of Vienna[39] and over 144 km between two Canary Islands, resulting in a successful demonstration that quantum communication with satellites is feasible. His dream is to put sources of entangled light onto a satellite in orbit.[20] A first step was achieved during an experiment at the Italian Matera Laser Ranging Observatory [it].[40]\n\n\n\n### Further novel entangled states[edit]\n\n\nWith his group, Anton Zeilinger made many contributions to the realization of novel entangled states. The source for polarization-entangled photon pairs developed with Paul Kwiat when he was a PostDoc in Zeilinger's group[41] is used in many laboratories. The first demonstration of entanglement of orbital angular momentum of photons opened up a new field of research in many laboratories.[42]\n\n\n\n### Macroscopic quantum superposition[edit]\n\n\nZeilinger is also interested to extend quantum mechanics into the macroscopic domain. In the early 1990s, he started experiments in the field of atom optics. He developed a number of ways to coherently manipulate atomic beams, many of which, like the coherent energy shift of an atomic De Broglie wave upon diffraction at a time-modulated light wave, have become part of today's ultracold atom experiments. In 1999, Zeilinger abandoned atom optics for experiments with very complex and massive macro-molecules – fullerenes. The successful demonstration of quantum interference for these C60 and C70 molecules[43] in 1999 opened up a very active field of research. \n\n\nIn 2005, Zeilinger with his group again started a new field, the quantum physics of mechanical cantilevers. The group was the first – in the year 2006 along with work from Heidmann in Paris and Kippenberg in Garching – to demonstrate experimentally the self-cooling of a micro-mirror by radiation pressure, that is, without feedback.[44]\n\n\nUsing orbital angular momentum states, he was able to demonstrate entanglement of angular momentum up to 300 ħ.[45]\n\n\n\n### Further fundamental tests[edit]\n\n\nZeilinger's program of fundamental tests of quantum mechanics is aimed at implementing experimental realizations of many non-classical features of quantum physics for individual systems. In 1998,[46] he provided the final test of Bell's inequality closing the communication loophole by using superfast random number generators. His group also realized the first Bell inequality experiment implementing the freedom-of-choice condition[47] and provided the first realization of a Bell test without the fair sampling assumption for photons.[48]\n\n\nAmong the further fundamental tests he performed the most notable one is his test of a large class of nonlocal realistic theories proposed by Leggett.[49] The group of theories excluded by that experiment can be classified as those which allow reasonable subdivision of ensembles into sub-ensembles. It goes significantly beyond Bell's theorem. While Bell showed that a theory which is both local and realistic is at variance with quantum mechanics, Leggett considered nonlocal realistic theories where the individual photons are assumed to carry polarization. The resulting Leggett inequality was shown to be violated in the experiments of the Zeilinger group.[50]\n\n\nIn an analogous way, his group showed that even quantum systems where entanglement is not possible exhibit non-classical features which cannot be explained by underlying non-contextual probability distributions.[51]\n\n\n\n### Neutron interferometry[edit]\n\n\nAnton Zeilinger's earliest work is perhaps his least known. His work on neutron interferometry has provided a foundation for his later research.[52]\n\n\nAs a member of the group of his thesis supervisor, Helmut Rauch, at the Technical University of Vienna, Zeilinger participated in a number of neutron interferometry experiments at the Institut Laue–Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble. His very first such experiment confirmed a fundamental prediction of quantum mechanics, the sign change of a spinor phase upon rotation.[53] This was followed by the first experimental realization of coherent spin superposition of matter waves. He continued his work in neutron interferometry at MIT with C.G. Shull (Nobel Laureate), focusing specifically on dynamical diffraction effects of neutrons in perfect crystals which are due to multi-wave coherent superposition. After his return to Europe, he built up an interferometer for very cold neutrons which preceded later similar experiments with atoms. The fundamental experiments there included a most precise test of the linearity of quantum mechanics. Zeilinger built a double-slit diffraction experiment[54] on the S18 instrument at the Institut Laue-Langevin which, later on, gained in accuracy and could act with only one neutron at a time in the apparatus.[55]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\nZeilinger has written more than 550 scientific articles, of which 500 are peer reviewed and 16 are considered highly cited papers.[56]\n\n\n\n## Honours and awards[edit]\n\n\n### International prizes and awards[edit]\n\n\n* Nobel Prize in Physics (2022, with John Clauser, Alain Aspect)[11]\n* Micius Quantum Prize, Micius Quantum Foundation (2019, with Stephen Wiesner, Charles H.

He studied physics at the University of Vienna from 1963 to 1971.[12] He received a doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1971, with a thesis on \"Neutron depolarization measurements on a Dy-single crystal\" under Helmut Rauch. He qualified as a university lecturer (habilitation) at the Vienna University of Technology in 1979.[13][14][15]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1970s, Zeilinger worked at the Vienna Atominstitut as a research assistant and later as an associate researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Neutron Diffraction Laboratory until 1979, when he accepted the position of assistant professor at the same Atominstitut. That year he qualified as a university professor. at the Vienna University of Technology.[12] [16]\n\n\nIn 1981 Zeilinger returned to MIT in 1981 as an associate professor on the physics faculty until 1983. Between 1980 and 1990 he worked as a professor at the Vienna University of Technology, the Technical University of Munich, the University of Innsbruck and the University of Vienna.[17]\n\n\nHe was also, between 2004 and 2013, the scientific director of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information in Vienna between 2004 and 2013.[12] Zeilinger became professor emeritus at the University of Vienna in 2013.[12] He was president of the Austrian Academy of Sciences from 2013 till 2022.[18]\n\n\nSince 2006, Zeilinger is the vice chairman of the board of trustees of the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, an ambitious project initiated by Zeilinger's proposal. In 2009, he founded the International Academy Traunkirchen,[19] which is dedicated to the support of gifted students in science and technology. He is a fan of the *Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy* by Douglas Adams, going so far as to name his sailboat 42.[20]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n### Quantum teleportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Quantum teleportation\n\nMost widely known is his first realization of quantum teleportation of an independent qubit.[21] He later expanded this work to developing a source for freely propagating teleported qubits[22] and quantum teleportation over 144 kilometers between two Canary Islands.[23] Quantum teleportation is an essential concept in many quantum information protocols. Besides its role for the transfer of quantum information, it is also considered as an important possible mechanism for building gates within quantum computers.[24]\n\n\n\n### Entanglement swapping – teleportation of entanglement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Entanglement swapping\n\nEntanglement swapping is the teleportation of an entangled state. After its proposal,[25] entanglement swapping has first been realized experimentally by Zeilinger's group in 1998.[26] It was then applied to carry out a delayed-choice entanglement swapping test.[27]\n\n\n\n### Entanglement beyond two qubits – GHZ-states and their realizations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anton Zeilinger holding a sculpture by Julian Voss-Andreae, photo by J. Godany\nAnton Zeilinger contributed to the opening up of the field of multi-particle entanglement.[28] In 1990, he was the first with Daniel Greenberger and Michael Horne to work on entanglement of more than two qubits.[29] The resulting GHZ theorem (see Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state) is fundamental for quantum physics, as it provides the most succinct contradiction between local realism and the predictions of quantum mechanics.[30]\n\n\nGHZ states were the first instances of multi-particle entanglement ever investigated.[31]\n\n\nFinally, in 1999, he succeeded in providing the first experimental evidence of entanglement beyond two particles[32] and also the first test of quantum nonlocality for GHZ states.[33]\n\n\n\n### Quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum computation[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998 (published in 2000), his group was the first to implement quantum cryptography with entangled photons.[34][35]\n\n\n  \n\nHe then also applied quantum entanglement to optical quantum computation, where in 2005,[36] he performed the first implementation of one-way quantum computation. This is a protocol based on quantum measurement as proposed by Knill, Laflamme and Milburn.[37]\n\n\nThe experiments of Zeilinger and his group on the distribution of entanglement over large distances began with both free-space and fiber-based quantum communication and teleportation between laboratories located on the different sides of the river Danube.[38] This was then extended to larger distances across the city of Vienna[39] and over 144 km between two Canary Islands, resulting in a successful demonstration that quantum communication with satellites is feasible. His dream is to put sources of entangled light onto a satellite in orbit.[20] A first step was achieved during an experiment at the Italian Matera Laser Ranging Observatory [it].[40]\n\n\n\n### Further novel entangled states[edit]\n\n\nWith his group, Anton Zeilinger made many contributions to the realization of novel entangled states. The source for polarization-entangled photon pairs developed with Paul Kwiat when he was a PostDoc in Zeilinger's group[41] is used in many laboratories. The first demonstration of entanglement of orbital angular momentum of photons opened up a new field of research in many laboratories.[42]\n\n\n\n### Macroscopic quantum superposition[edit]\n\n\nZeilinger is also interested to extend quantum mechanics into the macroscopic domain. In the early 1990s, he started experiments in the field of atom optics. He developed a number of ways to coherently manipulate atomic beams, many of which, like the coherent energy shift of an atomic De Broglie wave upon diffraction at a time-modulated light wave, have become part of today's ultracold atom experiments. In 1999, Zeilinger abandoned atom optics for experiments with very complex and massive macro-molecules – fullerenes. The successful demonstration of quantum interference for these C60 and C70 molecules[43] in 1999 opened up a very active field of research. \n\n\nIn 2005, Zeilinger with his group again started a new field, the quantum physics of mechanical cantilevers. The group was the first – in the year 2006 along with work from Heidmann in Paris and Kippenberg in Garching – to demonstrate experimentally the self-cooling of a micro-mirror by radiation pressure, that is, without feedback.[44]\n\n\nUsing orbital angular momentum states, he was able to demonstrate entanglement of angular momentum up to 300 ħ.[45]\n\n\n\n### Further fundamental tests[edit]\n\n\nZeilinger's program of fundamental tests of quantum mechanics is aimed at implementing experimental realizations of many non-classical features of quantum physics for individual systems. In 1998,[46] he provided the final test of Bell's inequality closing the communication loophole by using superfast random number generators. His group also realized the first Bell inequality experiment implementing the freedom-of-choice condition[47] and provided the first realization of a Bell test without the fair sampling assumption for photons.[48]\n\n\nAmong the further fundamental tests he performed the most notable one is his test of a large class of nonlocal realistic theories proposed by Leggett.[49] The group of theories excluded by that experiment can be classified as those which allow reasonable subdivision of ensembles into sub-ensembles. It goes significantly beyond Bell's theorem. While Bell showed that a theory which is both local and realistic is at variance with quantum mechanics, Leggett considered nonlocal realistic theories where the individual photons are assumed to carry polarization. The resulting Leggett inequality was shown to be violated in the experiments of the Zeilinger group.[50]\n\n\nIn an analogous way, his group showed that even quantum systems where entanglement is not possible exhibit non-classical features which cannot be explained by underlying non-contextual probability distributions.[51]\n\n\n\n### Neutron interferometry[edit]\n\n\nAnton Zeilinger's earliest work is perhaps his least known. His work on neutron interferometry has provided a foundation for his later research.[52]\n\n\nAs a member of the group of his thesis supervisor, Helmut Rauch, at the Technical University of Vienna, Zeilinger participated in a number of neutron interferometry experiments at the Institut Laue–Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble. His very first such experiment confirmed a fundamental prediction of quantum mechanics, the sign change of a spinor phase upon rotation.[53] This was followed by the first experimental realization of coherent spin superposition of matter waves. He continued his work in neutron interferometry at MIT with C.G. Shull (Nobel Laureate), focusing specifically on dynamical diffraction effects of neutrons in perfect crystals which are due to multi-wave coherent superposition. After his return to Europe, he built up an interferometer for very cold neutrons which preceded later similar experiments with atoms. The fundamental experiments there included a most precise test of the linearity of quantum mechanics. Zeilinger built a double-slit diffraction experiment[54] on the S18 instrument at the Institut Laue-Langevin which, later on, gained in accuracy and could act with only one neutron at a time in the apparatus.[55]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\nZeilinger has written more than 550 scientific articles, of which 500 are peer reviewed and 16 are considered highly cited papers.[56]\n\n\n\n## Honours and awards[edit]\n\n\n### International prizes and awards[edit]\n\n\n* Nobel Prize in Physics (2022, with John Clauser, Alain Aspect)[11]\n* Micius Quantum Prize, Micius Quantum Foundation (2019, with Stephen Wiesner, Charles H.
