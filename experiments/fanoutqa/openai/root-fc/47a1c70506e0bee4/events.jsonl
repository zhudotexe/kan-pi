There are also corporations having foundation in the United States, such as corporate headquarters, operational headquarters and independent subsidiaries. The list excludes large privately held companies such as Cargill and Koch Industries whose financial data is not necessarily available to the public. However, this list does include several government-sponsored enterprises that were created by acts of Congress and later became publicly traded.\n\n\n\n\n## List of the largest

By 1988, it was the most profitable retailer in the U.S.,[18] and it had become the largest in terms of revenue by October 1989.[19] The company was originally geographically limited to the South and lower Midwest, but it had stores from coast to coast by the early 1990s. Sam's Club opened in New Jersey in November 1989, and the first California outlet opened in Lancaster, in July 1990. A Walmart in York, Pennsylvania, opened in October 1990, the first main store in the Northeast.[20]\n\n\nWalmart's investments outside the U.S. have seen mixed results. Its operations and subsidiaries in Canada,[21] the United Kingdom (ASDA),[22] Central America, South America, and China are successful, but its ventures failed in Germany, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Argentina.[23][24][25][26]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Walmart\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n39. **^** \"Our History\". *Corporate – US*.

The largest Supercenter in the world, covering 260,000 square feet (24,000 square meters) on two floors, is located in Crossgates Commons in Albany, New York.[153]\n\n\nA typical supercenter sells approximately 120,000 items, compared to the 35 million products sold in Walmart's online store.[154]\n\n\nThe \"Supercenter\" name has since been phased out, with these stores now simply referred to as \"Walmart\", since the company introduced the new Walmart logo in 2008.

Large externally-oriented businesses tend to be associated with lower local standards of living, greater inequality, and less social and civic participation. In contrast, locally oriented businesses are associated with higher rates of church membership, community engagement, civic improvement and recreation. They may also be associated with higher rates of home-ownership and expenditures on health and public schools. The presence of local entrepreneurs with resources and motivation to invest in local communities may be key to addressing community problems. This research is not specific to Walmart, but to large businesses in general.[449]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n440. **^** \"When Vaccines Roll Out in the U.S., Walmart Stands Ready to Serve\". *Corporate – US*.

The same year, the company opened a home office and first distribution center in Bentonville, Arkansas. It had 38  stores operating with 1,500 employees and sales of $44.2  million. It began trading stock as a publicly held company on October 1, 1970, and was soon listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The first stock split occurred in May 1971 for $47 per share. By this time, Wal-Mart was operating in five states: Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma; it entered Tennessee in 1973 and Kentucky and Mississippi in 1974.

By the mid-1990s, it was the most powerful retailer in the U.S. and expanded into Mexico in 1991 and Canada in 1994.[44] Wal-Mart stores opened throughout the rest of the U.S., with Vermont being the last state to get a store in 1995.[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| State | Supercenters | DiscountStores | NeighborhoodMarkets | Amigos | Sam'sClubs | OtherPharmacyFormats | Totalstores\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alabama[192] | 101\n | 1\n | 28\n |  | 13\n | 1\n | 144\n |\n| Alaska[193] | 7\n | 2\n |  |  |  |  | 9\n |\n| Arizona[194] | 84\n | 2\n | 26\n |  | 12\n |  | 124\n |\n| Arkansas[195] | 76\n | 5\n | 33\n |  | 11\n | 8\n | 133\n |\n| California[196] | 144\n | 68\n | 66\n |  | 30\n | 1\n | 309\n |\n| Colorado[197] | 70\n | 4\n | 14\n |  | 17\n |  | 105\n |\n| Connecticut[198] | 12\n | 21\n |  |  | 1\n |  | 34\n |\n| Delaware[199] | 6\n | 3\n |  |  | 1\n |  | 10\n |\n| District of Columbia[200] | 3\n |  |  |  |  |  | 3\n |\n| Florida[201] | 232\n | 9\n | 98\n |  | 46\n | 2\n | 387\n |\n| Georgia[202] | 154\n | 2\n | 31\n |  | 24\n | 4\n | 215\n |\n| Hawaii[203] |  | 10\n |  |  | 2\n |  | 12\n |\n| Idaho[204] | 23\n |  | 3\n |  | 1\n |  | 27\n |\n| Illinois[205] | 139\n | 15\n | 5\n |  | 25\n |  | 184\n |\n| Indiana[206] | 97\n | 6\n | 9\n |  | 13\n | 2\n | 127\n |\n| Iowa[207] | 58\n | 2\n |  |  | 9\n |  | 69\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2015, the company closed five stores on short notice for plumbing repairs.[96] However, employees and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) alleged some stores were closed in retaliation for strikes aimed at increasing wages and improving working conditions.[97] The UFCW filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board.

A similar concept, Hypermart USA, had opened a year earlier in Garland, Texas. All Hypermart USA stores were later closed or converted into Supercenters.\n\n\nAs of October 31, 2022,[update] there were 3,572 Walmart Supercenters in 49 of the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.[2][3] Hawaii is the only state to not have a Supercenter location. The largest Supercenter in the world, covering 260,000 square feet (24,000 square meters) on two floors, is located in Crossgates Commons in Albany, New York.[153]\n\n\nA typical supercenter sells approximately 120,000 items, compared to the 35 million products sold in Walmart's online store.[154]\n\n\nThe \"Supercenter\" name has since been phased out, with these stores now simply referred to as \"Walmart\", since the company introduced the new Walmart logo in 2008. However, the branding is still used in Walmart's Canadian stores (spelled as \"Supercentre\" in Canadian English).[155]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Our History\". *Corporate.Walmart.com*.

Large externally-oriented businesses tend to be associated with lower local standards of living, greater inequality, and less social and civic participation. In contrast, locally oriented businesses are associated with higher rates of church membership, community engagement, civic improvement and recreation. They may also be associated with higher rates of home-ownership and expenditures on health and public schools. The presence of local entrepreneurs with resources and motivation to invest in local communities may be key to addressing community problems. This research is not specific to Walmart, but to large businesses in general.[449]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n440. **^** \"When Vaccines Roll Out in the U.S., Walmart Stands Ready to Serve\". *Corporate – US*.

The same year, the company opened a home office and first distribution center in Bentonville, Arkansas. It had 38  stores operating with 1,500 employees and sales of $44.2  million. It began trading stock as a publicly held company on October 1, 1970, and was soon listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The first stock split occurred in May 1971 for $47 per share. By this time, Wal-Mart was operating in five states: Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma; it entered Tennessee in 1973 and Kentucky and Mississippi in 1974. As the company moved into Texas in 1975, there were 125 stores with 7,500 employees and total sales of $340.3  million.[34]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. **^** Kenneth E.

Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5 million, $5 million and $9.5 million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.[175] In 2019, it spent $16.8 million and had a team of 104 lobbyists.[176]\n\n\nAmazon.com was a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) until it dropped membership following protests at its shareholders' meeting on May 24, 2012.[177]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that has earned it the moniker *The Everything Store*.[8] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmazon directly employs people to work at its warehouses, bulk distribution centers, staffed \"Amazon Hub Locker+\" locations, and delivery stations where drivers pick up packages.

Amazon has several types of distribution facilities consisting of cross-dock centers, fulfillment centers, sortation centers, delivery stations, Prime now hubs, and Prime air hubs. There are 75 fulfillment centers and 25 sortation centers with over 125,000 employees.[147][148] Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress.

He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address.[174] One of Bezos's most well-known internal memos was his mandate for \"all teams\" to \"expose their data and functionality\" through service interfaces \"designed from the ground up to be externalizable\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n55. **^** \"About Deliveries to Switzerland\".

The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates. Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019. These brands account for 0.15% of Amazon's global sales, whereas the average for other large retailers is 18%.[75] Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Third-party sellers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, \"that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\"[51] In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent.[192] In 2019, Amazon banned selling skin-lightening products after pushback from Minnesota health and environmental activists.[193] In 2022, a lawsuit filed by state attorney-general Letitia James was dismissed by the New York state court of appeals.[194]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon.[77] Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Affiliate program[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Achievements | * Music award\n* Best-selling music artists\n\t+ In: Brazil\n\t+ Finland\n\t+ Germany\n\t+ Japan\n\t+ United Kingdom (Females)\n\t+ United States\n\t+ Genre:\n\t\t- Latin\n\t+ Nationality:\n\t\t- Belgian\n\t\t- Brazilian\n\t\t- British\n\t\t- Italian\n\t\t- Swedish\n* Best-selling albums\n\t+ by country\n* Best-selling singles\n\t+ by country\n* Highest-paid musicians\n* Highest-grossing live music artists\n* Highest-grossing concert tours\n\t+ by women\n\t+ Latin\n* Most-attended concert tours\n* Most-attended concerts\n* Global Recording Artist of the Year\n* Wealthiest musical artists\n |\n| Other | * Album era\n* Album-equivalent unit\n* A-side and B-side\n* Backmasking\n* Bootleg recording\n* Christian music industry\n* Environmental impact\n* Hidden track\n* Largest music deals\n* Largest recorded music markets\n* Most expensive albums\n* Most valuable records\n* Music certification\n* Parental Advisory\n* Record sales\n* Surprise album\n* White label\n |\n| * **![](image) Record production portal**\n* **![](image) Category**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors.[88] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,[89] though Amazon states:\n\n\n\n\n> Please keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers—we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources\n> \n> — Amazon.com Help[90]\n> \n\n\n### Physical stores[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments. In an email to sellers Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: \"... *the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used*.\" The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse). If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.[83]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.[86] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.[86] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.[87] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2001, Amazon entered into a similar agreement with Borders Group, under which Amazon would comanage Borders.com as a co-branded service.[63] Borders pulled out of the arrangement in 2007, with plans to also launch its own online store.[64]\n\n\nOn October 18, 2011, Amazon.com announced a partnership with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to many popular comics, including *Superman*, *Batman*, *Green Lantern*, *The Sandman*, and *Watchmen*. The partnership has caused well-known bookstores like Barnes & Noble to remove these titles from their shelves.[65]\n\n\nIn November 2013, Amazon announced a partnership with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon's standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and New York because of the high-volume and inability to deliver in a timely way, with plans to expand into Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, Amazon expanded its lobbying practices as it prepared to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its drone delivery program, hiring the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld lobbying firm in June.[178] Amazon and its lobbyists have visited with Federal Aviation Administration officials and aviation committees in Washington, D.C. to explain its plans to deliver packages.[179] In September 2020 this moved one step closer with the granting of a critical certificate by the FAA.[180]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Criticism of Amazon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJane Friedman[195] discovered six listings of books fraudulently using her name, on Amazon and Goodreads.

It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany. In the subsequent year, it initiated the sale of a diverse range of products, including music, video games, consumer electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and toys..[26][27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n193. **^** \"Amazon pulls \"racist\" skin-lightening products\". *www.cbsnews.com*.

Twitch was acquired by Amazon in August 2014 for $970 million.[104] The site's rapid growth had been boosted primarily by the prominence of major esports competitions on the service, leading GameSpot senior esports editor Rod Breslau to have described the service as \"the ESPN of esports\".[105] As of 2015[update], the service had over 1.5 million broadcasters and 100 million monthly viewers.[106]\n\n\n\n#### Whole Foods Market[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Whole Foods Market store in Ann Arbor, Michigan\nWhole Foods Market is an American supermarket chain exclusively featuring foods without artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats.[107] Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August 2017.[108][109][9]\n\n\n\n#### Other[edit]\n\n\nOther Amazon subsidiaries include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis process, commonly known as a service-oriented architecture (SOA), resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Lobbying[edit]\n\n\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve. Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5 million, $5 million and $9.5 million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.[175] In 2019, it spent $16.8 million and had a team of 104 lobbyists.[176]\n\n\nAmazon.com was a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) until it dropped membership following protests at its shareholders' meeting on May 24, 2012.[177]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that has earned it the moniker *The Everything Store*.[8] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmazon directly employs people to work at its warehouses, bulk distribution centers, staffed \"Amazon Hub Locker+\" locations, and delivery stations where drivers pick up packages. As of December 2020, it is not hiring delivery drivers as employees.[144]\n\n\nRakuten Intelligence estimated that in 2020 in the United States, the proportion of last-mile deliveries was 56% by Amazon's directly contracted services (mostly in urban areas), 30% by the US Postal Service (mostly in rural areas), and 14% by UPS.[145] In April 2021, Amazon reported to investors it had increased its in-house delivery capacity by 50% in the last 12 months (which included the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States).[146]\n\n\n\n### Supply chain[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n174. **^** Ritson, Mark (February 3, 2021). \"Jeff Bezos's success at Amazon is down to one thing: focusing on the customer\". *Marketing Week*.

Amazon has several types of distribution facilities consisting of cross-dock centers, fulfillment centers, sortation centers, delivery stations, Prime now hubs, and Prime air hubs. There are 75 fulfillment centers and 25 sortation centers with over 125,000 employees.[147][148] Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. Some warehouses are partially automated with systems built by Amazon Robotics.[149]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJeff Bezos\n |\n| --- |\n| Organizations | * Amazon\n\t+ Amazon Web Services\n\t+ Alexa\n\t+ Amazon Appstore\n\t+ Amazon Luna\n\t+ Amazon Music\n\t+ Amazon Pay\n\t+ Amazon Prime\n\t+ Amazon Prime Video\n\t+ Ring\n\t+ Amazon Robotics\n\t+ Twitch\n* Blue Origin\n* Bezos Expeditions\n* Bezos Family Foundation\n* Washington Post\n |\n| Family | * Ted Jorgensen\n* Miguel Bezos\n* Jackie Bezos\n* Mark Bezos\n* MacKenzie Scott\n* Lauren Sánchez\n |\n| Related | * *Koru*\n* Billionaire space race\n* *The Everything Store*\n* *The Space Barons*\n* Phone hacking incident\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ Prime Pantry\n\t+ Prime Video\n\t\t- Sports\n* Marketplace\n* Music (Wondery)\n* Silk\n* Wireless\n |\n| Devices | * Astro\n* Echo\n\t+ Show\n* Echo Buds\n* Fire\n\t+ Fire HD\n\t+ Fire HDX\n* Fire TV\n\t+ Stick\n* Kindle\n |\n| Technology | * 1-Click\n* Dynamo\n* Obidos\n* Lumberyard\n |\n| Media | * Amazon Games\n* Amazon Publishing\n* Breakthrough Novel Award\n* Best Books of the Year\n* Amazon MGM Studios\n\t+ Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\t+ Orion Pictures\n\t+ American International Pictures\n\t+ MGM+\n* Kindle Direct Publishing\n* YES Network (15%)\n |\n| Retail | * Amazon Fresh\n* Amazon Go\n* Whole Foods Market\n |\n| Logistics | * Amazon Air\n* Amazon Prime Air\n |\n| Former | * 43 Things\n* Askville\n* Alexa Internet\n* Amapedia\n* Amazon Books\n* Amie Street (Songza)\n* CDNow\n* Dash buttons\n* Dash wand\n* Diapers.com\n* Digital Photography Review\n* Drive\n* Endless.com\n* Fire Phone\n* Lexcycle\n* Liquavista\n* LivingSocial\n* LoveFilm\n* MGM Holdings\n* Mobipocket\n* PlanetAll\n* Reflexive Entertainment\n* Sellaband\n* Shelfari\n* TenMarks\n* Treasure Truck\n* Withoutabox\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** Meyersohn, Nathaniel (January 24, 2023). \"Amazon launches $5-a-month unlimited prescription plan | CNN Business\". *CNN*.

The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates. Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019. These brands account for 0.15% of Amazon's global sales, whereas the average for other large retailers is 18%.[75] Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Third-party sellers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, \"that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\"[51] In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent.[192] In 2019, Amazon banned selling skin-lightening products after pushback from Minnesota health and environmental activists.[193] In 2022, a lawsuit filed by state attorney-general Letitia James was dismissed by the New York state court of appeals.[194]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon.[77] Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Affiliate program[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Achievements | * Music award\n* Best-selling music artists\n\t+ In: Brazil\n\t+ Finland\n\t+ Germany\n\t+ Japan\n\t+ United Kingdom (Females)\n\t+ United States\n\t+ Genre:\n\t\t- Latin\n\t+ Nationality:\n\t\t- Belgian\n\t\t- Brazilian\n\t\t- British\n\t\t- Italian\n\t\t- Swedish\n* Best-selling albums\n\t+ by country\n* Best-selling singles\n\t+ by country\n* Highest-paid musicians\n* Highest-grossing live music artists\n* Highest-grossing concert tours\n\t+ by women\n\t+ Latin\n* Most-attended concert tours\n* Most-attended concerts\n* Global Recording Artist of the Year\n* Wealthiest musical artists\n |\n| Other | * Album era\n* Album-equivalent unit\n* A-side and B-side\n* Backmasking\n* Bootleg recording\n* Christian music industry\n* Environmental impact\n* Hidden track\n* Largest music deals\n* Largest recorded music markets\n* Most expensive albums\n* Most valuable records\n* Music certification\n* Parental Advisory\n* Record sales\n* Surprise album\n* White label\n |\n| * **![](image) Record production portal**\n* **![](image) Category**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors.[88] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,[89] though Amazon states:\n\n\n\n\n> Please keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers—we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources\n> \n> — Amazon.com Help[90]\n> \n\n\n### Physical stores[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments. In an email to sellers Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: \"... *the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used*.\" The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse). If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.[83]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.[86] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.[86] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.[87] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2001, Amazon entered into a similar agreement with Borders Group, under which Amazon would comanage Borders.com as a co-branded service.[63] Borders pulled out of the arrangement in 2007, with plans to also launch its own online store.[64]\n\n\nOn October 18, 2011, Amazon.com announced a partnership with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to many popular comics, including *Superman*, *Batman*, *Green Lantern*, *The Sandman*, and *Watchmen*. The partnership has caused well-known bookstores like Barnes & Noble to remove these titles from their shelves.[65]\n\n\nIn November 2013, Amazon announced a partnership with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon's standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and New York because of the high-volume and inability to deliver in a timely way, with plans to expand into Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, Amazon expanded its lobbying practices as it prepared to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its drone delivery program, hiring the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld lobbying firm in June.[178] Amazon and its lobbyists have visited with Federal Aviation Administration officials and aviation committees in Washington, D.C. to explain its plans to deliver packages.[179] In September 2020 this moved one step closer with the granting of a critical certificate by the FAA.[180]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Criticism of Amazon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJane Friedman[195] discovered six listings of books fraudulently using her name, on Amazon and Goodreads.

It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany.

Rockefeller's Standard Oil. The company, which took its present name in 1999 per the merger of Exxon and Mobil, is vertically integrated across the entire oil and gas industry, and within it is also a chemicals division which produces plastic, synthetic rubber, and other chemical products. ExxonMobil is headquartered near the Houston suburb of Spring, Texas, though officially incorporated in the U.S. state of New Jersey.[7][8]: 1\n\n\nExxonMobil's history traces its earliest roots to 1866 with the formation of the Vacuum Oil Company, itself acquired by Standard Oil in 1879. The company that is today known as ExxonMobil grew out of the **Standard Oil Company of New Jersey** (or **Jersey Standard** for short), the corporate entity which effectively controlled all of Standard Oil prior to its breakup. Jersey Standard grew alongside and with extensive partnership another Standard Oil descendant and its future merger partner, the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), both of which grew bigger by merging with various third companies like Humble Oil (which merged with Jersey Standard) and Vacuum Oil (merged with Socony). Both companies underwent rebranding in the 1960s and early 1970s, and by the time of the 1999 merger, Jersey Standard had been known as Exxon, and Socony known as Mobil. The merger agreement between Exxon and Mobil stipulated that Exxon would buy Mobil and rebrand as ExxonMobil, with Mobil's CEO becoming the vice-chairman of the company.[9]\n\n\nExxonMobil is one of the world's largest and most powerful companies. ExxonMobil since its merger varied from the first to tenth largest publicly traded company by revenue, and has one of the largest market capitalizations out of any company.[10][11] As of 2023, in the most recent rankings released in the *Fortune* 500, ExxonMobil was ranked third, and twelfth on the *Fortune* Global 500.[12] ExxonMobil is the largest investor-owned oil company in the world, the largest oil company headquartered in the Western world, and the largest of the Big Oil companies in both production and market value.[13][14] ExxonMobil's reserves were 20 billion BOE at the end of 2016 and the 2007 rates of production were expected to last more than 14 years.[15] With 21 oil refineries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 4.9 million barrels (780,000 m3), ExxonMobil is the second largest oil refiner in the world, trailing only Sinopec.[16][17] Approximately 55.56% of the company's shares are held by institutions, the largest of which as of 2019 were The Vanguard Group (8.15%), BlackRock (6.61%), and State Street Corporation (4.83%).\n\n\nExxonMobil has been widely criticized, mostly for environmental incidents and its history of climate change denial against the scientific consensus that fossil fuels significantly contribute to global warming. The company is responsible for many oil spills, the largest and most notable of which was the *Exxon Valdez* oil spill in Alaska and itself considered to be one of the world's worst oil spills in terms of damage to the environment.[18][19] The company has also been the target of accusations of human rights violations, excessive influence on America's foreign policy, and its impact on various societies across the world.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of ExxonMobil\n\nExxonMobil traces its roots to Vacuum Oil Company, founded in 1866. Vacuum Oil later was acquired by Standard Oil in 1879, divested from Standard in 1911 with its breakup, and merged by the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), later known as Mobil, in 1931. After the 1911 breakup, Standard Oil continued to exist through its New Jersey subsidiary, sometimes shortened to Jersey Standard, and retained the Standard Oil name in much of the eastern United States. Jersey Standard grew by acquiring Humble Oil in the 1930s and became the dominant oil company on the world stage. The company's lack of ownership over the Standard Oil name across the United States, however, prompted a name change to unify all of its brands under one name, choosing to name itself Exxon in 1972 over continuing to use three distinct brands of Esso, Enco, and Humble.[21][9]\n\n\nIn 1998, the two companies agreed to merge and form ExxonMobil, with the deal closing on November 30, 1999. The two companies cited lower oil prices and a better ability to compete with other state-owned oil companies outside of the United States like Pemex and Aramco. With the deal, the two companies practically merged, with the new company's name containing both of the trade names of its immediate predecessors. However, the structure of the merger provided that Exxon was the surviving company and bought Mobil, rather than a new company being created.[9][22][23][24]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil is the largest non-government-owned company in the energy industry and produces about 3% of the world's oil and about 2% of the world's energy.[25]\n\n\nExxonMobil is vertically integrated into a number of global operating divisions. These divisions are grouped into three categories for reference purposes, though the company also has several standalone divisions, such as Coal & Minerals. It also owns hundreds of smaller subsidiaries such as XTO Energy and SeaRiver Maritime. ExxonMobil also has a majority ownership stake in Imperial Oil.[26]\n\n\n\n* Upstream (oil exploration, extraction, shipping, and wholesale operations)\n* Product Solutions (downstream, chemical)\n* Low Carbon Solutions [27]\n\n\n### Upstream[edit]\n\n\nThe upstream division makes up the majority of ExxonMobil's revenue, accounting for approximately 70% of it.[28] In 2021, ExxonMobil had about 30 billion barrels of oil and oil equivalents, as well as 38.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas.[29]\n\n\nIn the United States, ExxonMobil's petroleum exploration and production activities are concentrated in the Permian Basin, Bakken Formation, Woodford Shale, Caney Shale, and the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, ExxonMobil has several gas developments in the regions of Marcellus Shale, Utica Shale, Haynesville Shale, Barnett Shale, and Fayetteville Shale. All natural gas activities are conducted by its subsidiary, XTO Energy. As of December 31, 2014, ExxonMobil owned 14.6 million acres (59,000 km2) in the United States, of which 1.7 million acres (6,900 km2) were offshore, 1.5 million acres (6,100 km2) of which were in the Gulf of Mexico.[30] In California, it has a joint venture called Aera Energy LLC with Shell Oil. In Canada, the company holds 5.4 million acres (22,000 km2), including 1 million acres (4,000 km2) offshore and 0.7 million acres (2,800 km2) of the Kearl Oil Sands Project.[30]\n\n\nIn Argentina, ExxonMobil holds 0.9 million acres (3,600 km2) and 4.9 million acres (20,000 km2) in Germany. In the Netherlands ExxonMobil owns 1.5 million acres (6,100 km2), in Norway it owns 0.4 million acres (1,600 km2) offshore, and the United Kingdom 0.6 million acres (2,400 km2) offshore. In Africa, upstream operations are concentrated in Angola, where it owns 0.4 million acres (1,600 km2) offshore, Chad where it owns 46,000 acres (19,000 ha), Equatorial Guinea, where it owns 0.1 million acres (400 km2) offshore, and Nigeria, where it owns 0.8 million acres (3,200 km2) offshore.[30] In addition, ExxonMobil plans to start exploration activities off the coast of Liberia and the Ivory Coast.[31][32] In the past, ExxonMobil had exploration activities in Madagascar, however these operations were ended due to unsatisfactory results.[33]\n\n\nIn Asia, it holds 9,000 acres (3,600 ha) in Azerbaijan, 1.7 million acres (6,900 km2) in Indonesia, of which 1.3 million acres (5,300 km2) are offshore, 0.7 million acres (2,800 km2) in Iraq, 0.3 million acres (1,200 km2) in Kazakhstan, 0.2 million acres (810 km2) in Malaysia, 65,000 acres (26,000 ha) in Qatar, 10,000 acres (4,000 ha) in Yemen, 21,000 acres (8,500 ha) in Thailand, and 81,000 acres (33,000 ha) in the United Arab Emirates.[30]\n\n\nUntil the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, ExxonMobil held 85,000 acres (34,000 ha) in the Sakhalin-I project through its subsidiary Exxon Neftegas. Together with Rosneft, it has developed 63.6 million acres (257,000 km2) in Russia, including the East-Prinovozemelsky field. In Australia, ExxonMobil held 1.7 million acres (6,900 km2), including 1.6 million acres (6,500 km2) offshore. It also operates the Longford Gas Conditioning Plant, and participates in the development of Gorgon LNG project. In Papua New Guinea, it holds 1.1 million acres (4,500 km2), including the PNG Gas project.[30] After Russia's 2022 invasion began, though, ExxonMobil announced it was fully pulling out of both Russia and Sakhalin-I, and launched a lawsuit against Russia's federal government on August 30.[34]\n\n\n\n### Product Solutions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An ExxonMobil gas station in Hiawassee, Georgia\nExxonMobil formed its Product Solutions division in 2022, combining its previously separate Downstream and Chemical divisions into a single company.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Downstream and Retail[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil markets products around the world under the brands of Exxon, Mobil, and Esso. Mobil is ExxonMobil's primary retail gasoline brand in California, Florida, New York, New England, the Great Lakes, and the Midwest. Exxon is the primary brand in the rest of the United States, with the highest concentration of retail outlets located in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas (shared with Mobil), and in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states. ExxonMobil has stations in 46 states, just behind Shell USA and ahead of Phillips 66, lacking a presence only in Alaska, Hawaii, Iowa, and Kansas.[36]\n\n\nOutside of the United States, Esso and Mobil are primarily used, with Esso operating in 14 countries and Mobil operating in 29 countries and regions.[37]\n\n\nIn Japan, ExxonMobil had a 22% stake in TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K., a refining company that merged into Eneos in 2017.[38][39]\n\n\nExxonMobil's primary retail brands worldwide are Exxon, Esso, Mobil, with the former being used exclusively in the United States and the latter two being used in most other countries where ExxonMobil operates. Esso is the only one of its brands not used widely in the United States. Since 2008, Mobil is the only brand for the company lubricants. Since 2018, ExxonMobil has operated a loyalty program, ExxonMobil Rewards+, where customers earn rewards points when filling up at its stations in the United States and later the United Kingdom.[40][41][42]\n\n\n\n#### Chemicals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nExxonMobil Chemical is a petrochemical company that was created by merging Exxon's and Mobil's chemical industries in 1999. Its principal products include basic olefins and aromatics, ethylene glycol, polyethylene, and polypropylene along with speciality lines such as elastomers, plasticizers, solvents, process fluids, oxo alcohols and adhesive resins. The company also produces synthetic lubricant base stocks as well as lubricant additives, propylene packaging films and catalysts. ExxonMobil is the largest producer of butyl rubber.[43] Infineum, a joint venture with Shell plc, is manufacturing and marketing crankcase lubricant additives, fuel additives, and specialty lubricant additives, as well as automatic transmission fluids, gear oils, and industrial oils.[44]\n\n\n\n#### Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mobil 1\n\nMobil 1, a brand of synthetic motor oil, is a major sponsor of multiple racing teams and as the official motor oil of NASCAR since 2003.[45] ExxonMobil is currently in partnerships with Oracle Red Bull Racing in Formula One and Kalitta Motorsports.[46][47][48]\n\n\n\n#### Refineries[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil operates 21 refineries worldwide, and the company claims 80% of its refining capacity is integrated with chemical or lube basestocks. ExxonMobil's largest refinery in the United States is its Baytown Refinery, located in Baytown, Texas, and its largest refinery overall is its Jurong Island facility in Singapore; these two refineries combined output over 1.15 million barrels of oil per day. In 2021, ExxonMobil's global average refining capacity was 4.6 million barrels per day, with the United States producing a plurality of the company's refining capacity at about 1.77 million barrels per day. ExxonMobil's corporate website claims it refines almost 5 million barrels per day.[49][50][51][52]\n\n\nExxonMobil was one of few U.S. refiners to expand capacity by a significant margin following an industry downturn suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic.[53] The company completed a 250,000 barrels per day expansion at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery in early 2023.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Low Carbon Solutions[edit]\n\n\nOfficially formed with ExxonMobil's 2022 corporate restructuring, and currently led by former General Motors president Dan Ammann, Low Carbon Solutions is the company's alternative energy division. The division intends to lower emissions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as heavy industry, commercial transportation, and power generation using a combination of lower-emission fuels, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Low Carbon Solutions conducts research on clean energy technologies, including algae biofuels, biodiesel made from agricultural waste, carbonate fuel cells, and refining crude oil into plastic by using a membrane and osmosis instead of heat.[55][56] The company speculated in April 2023 that pending good economic conditions, the low-carbon solutions business could eclipse the value of its oil and gas operations.[57]\n\n\nThe company is in the process of designing its inaugural large-scale plant dedicated to producing low-carbon hydrogen, situated within its refining and petrochemical complex in Baytown, Texas. This project is set to become the world's largest low-carbon hydrogen project.[58][59]\n\n\n\n#### Carbon capture and storage[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil publicly announced it would be investing $15 billion in what it deemed a \"lower carbon future\", and claims to be the world leader in carbon capture and storage (CCS). The company additionally plans that its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions will be carbon neutral by 2050. ExxonMobil additionally acquired biofuel company Biojet AS in 2022, and its Canadian subsidiary Imperial Oil is moving ahead with plans to produce a renewable diesel biofuel.[60][61] In July 2023, Exxon agreed to acquire Denbury Resources for $4.9 billion to further its low-carbon efforts.[62]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\nBig Oil companies[b]\n| Company\n | Revenue (USD)[63] | Profit (USD)\n | Brands\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ExxonMobil | $286 billion\n | $23 billion\n | MobilEssoImperial Oil |\n| Shell plc | $273 billion\n | $20 billion\n | Jiffy LubePennzoil |\n| TotalEnergies | $185 billion\n | $16 billion\n | Elf AquitaineSunPower |\n| BP | $164 billion\n | $7.6 billion\n | AmocoAral AG |\n| Chevron | $163 billion\n | $16 billion\n | TexacoCaltexHavoline |\n| Marathon | $141 billion\n | $10 billion\n | ARCO[64] |\n| Phillips 66 | $115 billion\n | $1.3 billion\n | 76ConocoJET |\n| Valero | $108 billion\n | $0.9 billion\n | —\n |\n| Eni | $77 billion\n | $5.8 billion\n | —\n |\n| ConocoPhillips | $48.3 billion\n | $8.1 billion\n | —\n |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Financial data[edit]\n\n\nAccording to *Fortune* Global 500, ExxonMobil was the second largest company, second largest publicly held corporation, and the largest oil company in the United States by 2017 revenue.[65] For the fiscal year 2020, ExxonMobil reported a loss of US$22.4 billion, with an annual revenue of US$181.5 billion, a decline of 31.5% over the previous fiscal cycle.[66]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenue(mln.

Former ExxonMobil offices in Downtown Houston were vacated in early 2015.\nExxonMobil's headquarters are located in Spring, Texas, a suburb of Houston.[78][79]\n\n\nThe company decided to consolidate its Houston operations into one new campus located in northern Harris County and vacate its offices on 800 Bell St. which it had occupied since 1963.[80] The new operation complex includes twenty office buildings totaling 3,000,000 square feet (280,000 m2), a wellness center, laboratory, and three parking garages.[81] It is designed to house nearly 10,000 employees.\n\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nThe current chairman of the board and CEO of ExxonMobil Corp. is Darren W. Woods. Woods was elected chairman of the board and CEO effective January 1, 2017, after the retirement of former chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson. Before his election as chairman and CEO, Woods was elected president of ExxonMobil and a member of the board of directors in 2016.[82]\n\n\nAs of July 28, 2021[update], the current ExxonMobil board members are:[83]\n\n\n\n* Michael J.

Ubben, Founder, Portfolio Manager, and Managing Partner, Inclusive Capital Partners, L.P.\n* Darren W. Woods, chair of the board and CEO, ExxonMobil Corporation\n\n\nHooley is presently the lead independent director, having succeeded former Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier upon his retirement in May 2022.[84] Three of the directors nominated at the last Annual General Meeting were nominated after a proxy battle against hedge fund Engine No.1 and were nominated against the suggestion of the board.[85]\n\n\n\n### Key Executives[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil's key executives are:[86]\n\n\n\n* Darren Woods, chairman and CEO\n* Neil Chapman, Senior Vice President\n* Kathryn Mikells, CFO and Senior Vice President\n* Jack Williams, Senior Vice President\n* James Spellings, General Tax Counsel and Vice President\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Criticism of ExxonMobil\n\n![](image)Extinction Rebellion protestors demonstrating against ExxonMobil\n### Climate change denial[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: ExxonMobil climate change denial\n\nExxonMobil's environmental record has faced much criticism for its stance[87] and impact on global warming.[88] In 2018, the Political Economy Research Institute ranks ExxonMobil tenth among American corporations emitting airborne pollutants,[89] thirteenth by emitting greenhouse gases,[90] and sixteenth by emitting water pollutants.[91] A 2017 report places ExxonMobil as the fifth largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions from 1988 to 2015.[92][93] As of 2005[update], ExxonMobil had committed less than 1% of their profits towards researching alternative energy,[94] which, according to the advocacy organization Ceres, is less than other leading oil companies.[95][*needs update*] According to the 2021 Arctic Environmental Responsibility Index (AERI), ExxonMobil is ranked as the sixth most environmentally responsible company among 120 oil, gas, and mining companies involved in resource extraction north of the Arctic Circle.[96] The company's activities gained international notoriety from many incidents, most notably the *Exxon Valdez* oil spill in 1989. As of 2020, ExxonMobil has been responsible for more than 3,000 oil spills and leakages which resulted in a loss of more than one barrel of oil, with the most in a single year being 484 spills in 2011.[97] Additionally, since 1965, ExxonMobil has released more than 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide pollution.[98]\n\n\nIn 2023, *Science* journal published a paper reporting that the global warming projections and models created by ExxonMobil's own scientists between 1977 and 2003 had \"accurately\" projected and \"skillfully\" modeled global warming due to fossil fuel burning, and had reasonably estimated how much CO2 would lead to dangerous warming. The authors of the paper concluded: \"Yet, whereas academic and government scientists worked to communicate what they knew to the public, ExxonMobil worked to deny it.\"[99][100]\n\n\nBetween the 1980s and 2014, ExxonMobil was a notable denier of climate change, though the company officially changed its position in 2014 to acknowledge the existence of climate change. ExxonMobil's prolonged response incited the creation of the *Exxon Knew* movement, which aims to hold the company accountable for various climate-related incidents. ExxonMobil has used its own website to attack *Exxon Knew*, claiming that it is a coordinated effort to defame the company.[101][102][103][104]\n\n\nIn December 2022, U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney and U.S. House Oversight Environment Subcommittee Chair Ro Khanna sent a memorandum to all House Oversight and Reform Committee members summarizing additional findings from the committee's investigation into the fossil fuel industry disinformation campaign to obscure the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming. Upon reviewing internal company documents, they accused ExxonMobil along with BP, Chevron, and Shell of greenwashing their Paris Agreement carbon neutrality pledges while continuing long-term investment in fossil fuel production and sales, for engaging in a campaign to promote the use of natural gas as a clean energy source and bridge fuel to renewable energy, and of intimidating journalists reporting about the companies' climate actions and of obstructing the committee's investigation, which ExxonMobil, Shell, and the American Petroleum Institute denied.[105][106][107]\n\n\n\n### Oil spills and plastic pollution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup\nExxonMobil's operations have been subject to numerous oil spills both before and after the 1999 merger. The most widely publicized oil spill was the 1989 *Valdez* oil spill, where an Exxon tanker discharged approximately 11 million U.S. gallons (42,000 m3) of oil into Prince William Sound,[108] oiling 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of the remote Alaskan coastline. The spill remains the second largest in American history, only trailing BP's *Deepwater Horizon* spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[109]\n\n\nExxonMobil was also responsible for various other oil spills across the world. Some of Exxon's largest and most notable oil spills in the United States include long-lasting oil leaks totaling into an estimated 30 million gallon spill into New York City's Newtown Creek over the course of a century by Exxon and other Standard Oil predecessors,[110] a 2011 oil spill which leaked 1,500 barrels of oil into the Yellowstone River (resulting in about $135 million in damages),[111] and a 2012 1,900 barrel (80,000 gallon) spill from the company's Baton Rouge Refinery in the rivers of Point Coupee Parish, Louisiana.[112] ExxonMobil's actives in Louisiana in particular, especially its Baton Rouge Refinery, have given the area the nickname of *Cancer Alley*. The company's activities, along with other operations and refineries in the area, have been the source of increased cancer infections, lower air quality, and as seen by some, potential environmental racism committed by the company.[113][114]\n\n\nIn May 2021, ExxonMobil topped the Plastic Waste Makers Index report published by the Minderoo Foundation of 20 petrochemical companies that manufactured 55 percent of the single-use plastic waste in the world in 2019 (which were part of a larger group of 100 petrochemical companies that manufactured 90 percent of the waste),[115][116] while in April 2022, California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a subpoena to ExxonMobil for information related to the company's role in overstating the effectiveness of plastic recycling in reducing plastic pollution as part of an industry campaign to promote plastic usage.[117][118][119]\n\n\n\n### Geopolitical influence and human rights violations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Conflict in the Niger Delta\n\n![](image)Former CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, May 2017\nExxonMobil has also been accused of human rights violations and abusing its geopolitical influence.[20] In the book *Private Empire* by Steve Coll, ExxonMobil is described as extremely powerful \"corporate state within the American state\" in dealing with the countries in which it drills, going to the point as describing such countries' governments as \"constrained\".[120] The company's corporate ancestors are also blamed for the outbreak of the 1954 Jebel Akhdar War, which was sparked by the Iraq Petroleum Company's activities.[121][122]\n\n\n\n#### Indonesia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in Aceh\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, ExxonMobil (through predecessor Mobil) hired military units of the Indonesian National Army to provide security for their gas extraction and liquefaction project in Aceh, Indonesia, and these military units were accused of committing human rights violations. ExxonMobil eventually pulled out from Indonesia completely in 2001, while denying any wrongdoing.[123]\n\n\n\n### Other controversies[edit]\n\n\nDuring a 2022 surge in profits among ExxonMobil and other large oil companies, partly due to the war in Ukraine,[124][125] U.S. President Joe Biden criticized ExxonMobil. In June 2022, amid record oil prices, he said that \"Exxon made more money than God this year\".[126] When the oil giant reported its second quarter earnings in 2022, CNN reported that Exxon made US$2,245.62 per second in profit across the 92-day long second quarter.[127]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Esso\n* History of ExxonMobil\n* Litigation involving ExxonMobil:\n\t+ *Connecticut v.

Rockefeller's Standard Oil. The company, which took its present name in 1999 per the merger of Exxon and Mobil, is vertically integrated across the entire oil and gas industry, and within it is also a chemicals division which produces plastic, synthetic rubber, and other chemical products. ExxonMobil is headquartered near the Houston suburb of Spring, Texas, though officially incorporated in the U.S. state of New Jersey.[7][8]: 1\n\n\nExxonMobil's history traces its earliest roots to 1866 with the formation of the Vacuum Oil Company, itself acquired by Standard Oil in 1879. The company that is today known as ExxonMobil grew out of the **Standard Oil Company of New Jersey** (or **Jersey Standard** for short), the corporate entity which effectively controlled all of Standard Oil prior to its breakup. Jersey Standard grew alongside and with extensive partnership another Standard Oil descendant and its future merger partner, the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), both of which grew bigger by merging with various third companies like Humble Oil (which merged with Jersey Standard) and Vacuum Oil (merged with Socony). Both companies underwent rebranding in the 1960s and early 1970s, and by the time of the 1999 merger, Jersey Standard had been known as Exxon, and Socony known as Mobil. The merger agreement between Exxon and Mobil stipulated that Exxon would buy Mobil and rebrand as ExxonMobil, with Mobil's CEO becoming the vice-chairman of the company.[9]\n\n\nExxonMobil is one of the world's largest and most powerful companies. ExxonMobil since its merger varied from the first to tenth largest publicly traded company by revenue, and has one of the largest market capitalizations out of any company.[10][11] As of 2023, in the most recent rankings released in the *Fortune* 500, ExxonMobil was ranked third, and twelfth on the *Fortune* Global 500.[12] ExxonMobil is the largest investor-owned oil company in the world, the largest oil company headquartered in the Western world, and the largest of the Big Oil companies in both production and market value.[13][14] ExxonMobil's reserves were 20 billion BOE at the end of 2016 and the 2007 rates of production were expected to last more than 14 years.[15] With 21 oil refineries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 4.9 million barrels (780,000 m3), ExxonMobil is the second largest oil refiner in the world, trailing only Sinopec.[16][17] Approximately 55.56% of the company's shares are held by institutions, the largest of which as of 2019 were The Vanguard Group (8.15%), BlackRock (6.61%), and State Street Corporation (4.83%).\n\n\nExxonMobil has been widely criticized, mostly for environmental incidents and its history of climate change denial against the scientific consensus that fossil fuels significantly contribute to global warming. The company is responsible for many oil spills, the largest and most notable of which was the *Exxon Valdez* oil spill in Alaska and itself considered to be one of the world's worst oil spills in terms of damage to the environment.[18][19] The company has also been the target of accusations of human rights violations, excessive influence on America's foreign policy, and its impact on various societies across the world.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of ExxonMobil\n\nExxonMobil traces its roots to Vacuum Oil Company, founded in 1866. Vacuum Oil later was acquired by Standard Oil in 1879, divested from Standard in 1911 with its breakup, and merged by the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), later known as Mobil, in 1931. After the 1911 breakup, Standard Oil continued to exist through its New Jersey subsidiary, sometimes shortened to Jersey Standard, and retained the Standard Oil name in much of the eastern United States. Jersey Standard grew by acquiring Humble Oil in the 1930s and became the dominant oil company on the world stage. The company's lack of ownership over the Standard Oil name across the United States, however, prompted a name change to unify all of its brands under one name, choosing to name itself Exxon in 1972 over continuing to use three distinct brands of Esso, Enco, and Humble.[21][9]\n\n\nIn 1998, the two companies agreed to merge and form ExxonMobil, with the deal closing on November 30, 1999. The two companies cited lower oil prices and a better ability to compete with other state-owned oil companies outside of the United States like Pemex and Aramco. With the deal, the two companies practically merged, with the new company's name containing both of the trade names of its immediate predecessors. However, the structure of the merger provided that Exxon was the surviving company and bought Mobil, rather than a new company being created.[9][22][23][24]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil is the largest non-government-owned company in the energy industry and produces about 3% of the world's oil and about 2% of the world's energy.[25]\n\n\nExxonMobil is vertically integrated into a number of global operating divisions. These divisions are grouped into three categories for reference purposes, though the company also has several standalone divisions, such as Coal & Minerals. It also owns hundreds of smaller subsidiaries such as XTO Energy and SeaRiver Maritime. ExxonMobil also has a majority ownership stake in Imperial Oil.[26]\n\n\n\n* Upstream (oil exploration, extraction, shipping, and wholesale operations)\n* Product Solutions (downstream, chemical)\n* Low Carbon Solutions [27]\n\n\n### Upstream[edit]\n\n\nThe upstream division makes up the majority of ExxonMobil's revenue, accounting for approximately 70% of it.[28] In 2021, ExxonMobil had about 30 billion barrels of oil and oil equivalents, as well as 38.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas.[29]\n\n\nIn the United States, ExxonMobil's petroleum exploration and production activities are concentrated in the Permian Basin, Bakken Formation, Woodford Shale, Caney Shale, and the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, ExxonMobil has several gas developments in the regions of Marcellus Shale, Utica Shale, Haynesville Shale, Barnett Shale, and Fayetteville Shale. All natural gas activities are conducted by its subsidiary, XTO Energy. As of December 31, 2014, ExxonMobil owned 14.6 million acres (59,000 km2) in the United States, of which 1.7 million acres (6,900 km2) were offshore, 1.5 million acres (6,100 km2) of which were in the Gulf of Mexico.[30] In California, it has a joint venture called Aera Energy LLC with Shell Oil. In Canada, the company holds 5.4 million acres (22,000 km2), including 1 million acres (4,000 km2) offshore and 0.7 million acres (2,800 km2) of the Kearl Oil Sands Project.[30]\n\n\nIn Argentina, ExxonMobil holds 0.9 million acres (3,600 km2) and 4.9 million acres (20,000 km2) in Germany. In the Netherlands ExxonMobil owns 1.5 million acres (6,100 km2), in Norway it owns 0.4 million acres (1,600 km2) offshore, and the United Kingdom 0.6 million acres (2,400 km2) offshore. In Africa, upstream operations are concentrated in Angola, where it owns 0.4 million acres (1,600 km2) offshore, Chad where it owns 46,000 acres (19,000 ha), Equatorial Guinea, where it owns 0.1 million acres (400 km2) offshore, and Nigeria, where it owns 0.8 million acres (3,200 km2) offshore.[30] In addition, ExxonMobil plans to start exploration activities off the coast of Liberia and the Ivory Coast.[31][32] In the past, ExxonMobil had exploration activities in Madagascar, however these operations were ended due to unsatisfactory results.[33]\n\n\nIn Asia, it holds 9,000 acres (3,600 ha) in Azerbaijan, 1.7 million acres (6,900 km2) in Indonesia, of which 1.3 million acres (5,300 km2) are offshore, 0.7 million acres (2,800 km2) in Iraq, 0.3 million acres (1,200 km2) in Kazakhstan, 0.2 million acres (810 km2) in Malaysia, 65,000 acres (26,000 ha) in Qatar, 10,000 acres (4,000 ha) in Yemen, 21,000 acres (8,500 ha) in Thailand, and 81,000 acres (33,000 ha) in the United Arab Emirates.[30]\n\n\nUntil the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, ExxonMobil held 85,000 acres (34,000 ha) in the Sakhalin-I project through its subsidiary Exxon Neftegas. Together with Rosneft, it has developed 63.6 million acres (257,000 km2) in Russia, including the East-Prinovozemelsky field. In Australia, ExxonMobil held 1.7 million acres (6,900 km2), including 1.6 million acres (6,500 km2) offshore. It also operates the Longford Gas Conditioning Plant, and participates in the development of Gorgon LNG project. In Papua New Guinea, it holds 1.1 million acres (4,500 km2), including the PNG Gas project.[30] After Russia's 2022 invasion began, though, ExxonMobil announced it was fully pulling out of both Russia and Sakhalin-I, and launched a lawsuit against Russia's federal government on August 30.[34]\n\n\n\n### Product Solutions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An ExxonMobil gas station in Hiawassee, Georgia\nExxonMobil formed its Product Solutions division in 2022, combining its previously separate Downstream and Chemical divisions into a single company.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Downstream and Retail[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil markets products around the world under the brands of Exxon, Mobil, and Esso. Mobil is ExxonMobil's primary retail gasoline brand in California, Florida, New York, New England, the Great Lakes, and the Midwest. Exxon is the primary brand in the rest of the United States, with the highest concentration of retail outlets located in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas (shared with Mobil), and in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states. ExxonMobil has stations in 46 states, just behind Shell USA and ahead of Phillips 66, lacking a presence only in Alaska, Hawaii, Iowa, and Kansas.[36]\n\n\nOutside of the United States, Esso and Mobil are primarily used, with Esso operating in 14 countries and Mobil operating in 29 countries and regions.[37]\n\n\nIn Japan, ExxonMobil had a 22% stake in TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K., a refining company that merged into Eneos in 2017.[38][39]\n\n\nExxonMobil's primary retail brands worldwide are Exxon, Esso, Mobil, with the former being used exclusively in the United States and the latter two being used in most other countries where ExxonMobil operates. Esso is the only one of its brands not used widely in the United States. Since 2008, Mobil is the only brand for the company lubricants. Since 2018, ExxonMobil has operated a loyalty program, ExxonMobil Rewards+, where customers earn rewards points when filling up at its stations in the United States and later the United Kingdom.[40][41][42]\n\n\n\n#### Chemicals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nExxonMobil Chemical is a petrochemical company that was created by merging Exxon's and Mobil's chemical industries in 1999. Its principal products include basic olefins and aromatics, ethylene glycol, polyethylene, and polypropylene along with speciality lines such as elastomers, plasticizers, solvents, process fluids, oxo alcohols and adhesive resins. The company also produces synthetic lubricant base stocks as well as lubricant additives, propylene packaging films and catalysts. ExxonMobil is the largest producer of butyl rubber.[43] Infineum, a joint venture with Shell plc, is manufacturing and marketing crankcase lubricant additives, fuel additives, and specialty lubricant additives, as well as automatic transmission fluids, gear oils, and industrial oils.[44]\n\n\n\n#### Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mobil 1\n\nMobil 1, a brand of synthetic motor oil, is a major sponsor of multiple racing teams and as the official motor oil of NASCAR since 2003.[45] ExxonMobil is currently in partnerships with Oracle Red Bull Racing in Formula One and Kalitta Motorsports.[46][47][48]\n\n\n\n#### Refineries[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil operates 21 refineries worldwide, and the company claims 80% of its refining capacity is integrated with chemical or lube basestocks. ExxonMobil's largest refinery in the United States is its Baytown Refinery, located in Baytown, Texas, and its largest refinery overall is its Jurong Island facility in Singapore; these two refineries combined output over 1.15 million barrels of oil per day. In 2021, ExxonMobil's global average refining capacity was 4.6 million barrels per day, with the United States producing a plurality of the company's refining capacity at about 1.77 million barrels per day. ExxonMobil's corporate website claims it refines almost 5 million barrels per day.[49][50][51][52]\n\n\nExxonMobil was one of few U.S. refiners to expand capacity by a significant margin following an industry downturn suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic.[53] The company completed a 250,000 barrels per day expansion at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery in early 2023.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Low Carbon Solutions[edit]\n\n\nOfficially formed with ExxonMobil's 2022 corporate restructuring, and currently led by former General Motors president Dan Ammann, Low Carbon Solutions is the company's alternative energy division. The division intends to lower emissions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as heavy industry, commercial transportation, and power generation using a combination of lower-emission fuels, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Low Carbon Solutions conducts research on clean energy technologies, including algae biofuels, biodiesel made from agricultural waste, carbonate fuel cells, and refining crude oil into plastic by using a membrane and osmosis instead of heat.[55][56] The company speculated in April 2023 that pending good economic conditions, the low-carbon solutions business could eclipse the value of its oil and gas operations.[57]\n\n\nThe company is in the process of designing its inaugural large-scale plant dedicated to producing low-carbon hydrogen, situated within its refining and petrochemical complex in Baytown, Texas. This project is set to become the world's largest low-carbon hydrogen project.[58][59]\n\n\n\n#### Carbon capture and storage[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil publicly announced it would be investing $15 billion in what it deemed a \"lower carbon future\", and claims to be the world leader in carbon capture and storage (CCS). The company additionally plans that its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions will be carbon neutral by 2050. ExxonMobil additionally acquired biofuel company Biojet AS in 2022, and its Canadian subsidiary Imperial Oil is moving ahead with plans to produce a renewable diesel biofuel.[60][61] In July 2023, Exxon agreed to acquire Denbury Resources for $4.9 billion to further its low-carbon efforts.[62]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\nBig Oil companies[b]\n| Company\n | Revenue (USD)[63] | Profit (USD)\n | Brands\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ExxonMobil | $286 billion\n | $23 billion\n | MobilEssoImperial Oil |\n| Shell plc | $273 billion\n | $20 billion\n | Jiffy LubePennzoil |\n| TotalEnergies | $185 billion\n | $16 billion\n | Elf AquitaineSunPower |\n| BP | $164 billion\n | $7.6 billion\n | AmocoAral AG |\n| Chevron | $163 billion\n | $16 billion\n | TexacoCaltexHavoline |\n| Marathon | $141 billion\n | $10 billion\n | ARCO[64] |\n| Phillips 66 | $115 billion\n | $1.3 billion\n | 76ConocoJET |\n| Valero | $108 billion\n | $0.9 billion\n | —\n |\n| Eni | $77 billion\n | $5.8 billion\n | —\n |\n| ConocoPhillips | $48.3 billion\n | $8.1 billion\n | —\n |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Financial data[edit]\n\n\nAccording to *Fortune* Global 500, ExxonMobil was the second largest company, second largest publicly held corporation, and the largest oil company in the United States by 2017 revenue.[65] For the fiscal year 2020, ExxonMobil reported a loss of US$22.4 billion, with an annual revenue of US$181.5 billion, a decline of 31.5% over the previous fiscal cycle.[66]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenue(mln.

Former ExxonMobil offices in Downtown Houston were vacated in early 2015.\nExxonMobil's headquarters are located in Spring, Texas, a suburb of Houston.[78][79]\n\n\nThe company decided to consolidate its Houston operations into one new campus located in northern Harris County and vacate its offices on 800 Bell St. which it had occupied since 1963.[80] The new operation complex includes twenty office buildings totaling 3,000,000 square feet (280,000 m2), a wellness center, laboratory, and three parking garages.[81] It is designed to house nearly 10,000 employees.\n\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nThe current chairman of the board and CEO of ExxonMobil Corp. is Darren W. Woods. Woods was elected chairman of the board and CEO effective January 1, 2017, after the retirement of former chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson. Before his election as chairman and CEO, Woods was elected president of ExxonMobil and a member of the board of directors in 2016.[82]\n\n\nAs of July 28, 2021[update], the current ExxonMobil board members are:[83]\n\n\n\n* Michael J. Angelakis, chair and chief executive officer of Atairos Group Inc.\n* Susan Avery, president emerita of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n* Angela Braly, former president and CEO of WellPoint (now Anthem)\n* Ursula Burns, former chair and CEO of Xerox\n* Gregory J.

Ubben, Founder, Portfolio Manager, and Managing Partner, Inclusive Capital Partners, L.P.\n* Darren W. Woods, chair of the board and CEO, ExxonMobil Corporation\n\n\nHooley is presently the lead independent director, having succeeded former Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier upon his retirement in May 2022.[84] Three of the directors nominated at the last Annual General Meeting were nominated after a proxy battle against hedge fund Engine No.1 and were nominated against the suggestion of the board.[85]\n\n\n\n### Key Executives[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil's key executives are:[86]\n\n\n\n* Darren Woods, chairman and CEO\n* Neil Chapman, Senior Vice President\n* Kathryn Mikells, CFO and Senior Vice President\n* Jack Williams, Senior Vice President\n* James Spellings, General Tax Counsel and Vice President\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Criticism of ExxonMobil\n\n![](image)Extinction Rebellion protestors demonstrating against ExxonMobil\n### Climate change denial[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: ExxonMobil climate change denial\n\nExxonMobil's environmental record has faced much criticism for its stance[87] and impact on global warming.[88] In 2018, the Political Economy Research Institute ranks ExxonMobil tenth among American corporations emitting airborne pollutants,[89] thirteenth by emitting greenhouse gases,[90] and sixteenth by emitting water pollutants.[91] A 2017 report places ExxonMobil as the fifth largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions from 1988 to 2015.[92][93] As of 2005[update], ExxonMobil had committed less than 1% of their profits towards researching alternative energy,[94] which, according to the advocacy organization Ceres, is less than other leading oil companies.[95][*needs update*] According to the 2021 Arctic Environmental Responsibility Index (AERI), ExxonMobil is ranked as the sixth most environmentally responsible company among 120 oil, gas, and mining companies involved in resource extraction north of the Arctic Circle.[96] The company's activities gained international notoriety from many incidents, most notably the *Exxon Valdez* oil spill in 1989. As of 2020, ExxonMobil has been responsible for more than 3,000 oil spills and leakages which resulted in a loss of more than one barrel of oil, with the most in a single year being 484 spills in 2011.[97] Additionally, since 1965, ExxonMobil has released more than 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide pollution.[98]\n\n\nIn 2023, *Science* journal published a paper reporting that the global warming projections and models created by ExxonMobil's own scientists between 1977 and 2003 had \"accurately\" projected and \"skillfully\" modeled global warming due to fossil fuel burning, and had reasonably estimated how much CO2 would lead to dangerous warming. The authors of the paper concluded: \"Yet, whereas academic and government scientists worked to communicate what they knew to the public, ExxonMobil worked to deny it.\"[99][100]\n\n\nBetween the 1980s and 2014, ExxonMobil was a notable denier of climate change, though the company officially changed its position in 2014 to acknowledge the existence of climate change. ExxonMobil's prolonged response incited the creation of the *Exxon Knew* movement, which aims to hold the company accountable for various climate-related incidents. ExxonMobil has used its own website to attack *Exxon Knew*, claiming that it is a coordinated effort to defame the company.[101][102][103][104]\n\n\nIn December 2022, U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney and U.S. House Oversight Environment Subcommittee Chair Ro Khanna sent a memorandum to all House Oversight and Reform Committee members summarizing additional findings from the committee's investigation into the fossil fuel industry disinformation campaign to obscure the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming. Upon reviewing internal company documents, they accused ExxonMobil along with BP, Chevron, and Shell of greenwashing their Paris Agreement carbon neutrality pledges while continuing long-term investment in fossil fuel production and sales, for engaging in a campaign to promote the use of natural gas as a clean energy source and bridge fuel to renewable energy, and of intimidating journalists reporting about the companies' climate actions and of obstructing the committee's investigation, which ExxonMobil, Shell, and the American Petroleum Institute denied.[105][106][107]\n\n\n\n### Oil spills and plastic pollution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup\nExxonMobil's operations have been subject to numerous oil spills both before and after the 1999 merger. The most widely publicized oil spill was the 1989 *Valdez* oil spill, where an Exxon tanker discharged approximately 11 million U.S. gallons (42,000 m3) of oil into Prince William Sound,[108] oiling 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of the remote Alaskan coastline. The spill remains the second largest in American history, only trailing BP's *Deepwater Horizon* spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[109]\n\n\nExxonMobil was also responsible for various other oil spills across the world. Some of Exxon's largest and most notable oil spills in the United States include long-lasting oil leaks totaling into an estimated 30 million gallon spill into New York City's Newtown Creek over the course of a century by Exxon and other Standard Oil predecessors,[110] a 2011 oil spill which leaked 1,500 barrels of oil into the Yellowstone River (resulting in about $135 million in damages),[111] and a 2012 1,900 barrel (80,000 gallon) spill from the company's Baton Rouge Refinery in the rivers of Point Coupee Parish, Louisiana.[112] ExxonMobil's actives in Louisiana in particular, especially its Baton Rouge Refinery, have given the area the nickname of *Cancer Alley*. The company's activities, along with other operations and refineries in the area, have been the source of increased cancer infections, lower air quality, and as seen by some, potential environmental racism committed by the company.[113][114]\n\n\nIn May 2021, ExxonMobil topped the Plastic Waste Makers Index report published by the Minderoo Foundation of 20 petrochemical companies that manufactured 55 percent of the single-use plastic waste in the world in 2019 (which were part of a larger group of 100 petrochemical companies that manufactured 90 percent of the waste),[115][116] while in April 2022, California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a subpoena to ExxonMobil for information related to the company's role in overstating the effectiveness of plastic recycling in reducing plastic pollution as part of an industry campaign to promote plastic usage.[117][118][119]\n\n\n\n### Geopolitical influence and human rights violations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Conflict in the Niger Delta\n\n![](image)Former CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, May 2017\nExxonMobil has also been accused of human rights violations and abusing its geopolitical influence.[20] In the book *Private Empire* by Steve Coll, ExxonMobil is described as extremely powerful \"corporate state within the American state\" in dealing with the countries in which it drills, going to the point as describing such countries' governments as \"constrained\".[120] The company's corporate ancestors are also blamed for the outbreak of the 1954 Jebel Akhdar War, which was sparked by the Iraq Petroleum Company's activities.[121][122]\n\n\n\n#### Indonesia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in Aceh\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, ExxonMobil (through predecessor Mobil) hired military units of the Indonesian National Army to provide security for their gas extraction and liquefaction project in Aceh, Indonesia, and these military units were accused of committing human rights violations. ExxonMobil eventually pulled out from Indonesia completely in 2001, while denying any wrongdoing.[123]\n\n\n\n### Other controversies[edit]\n\n\nDuring a 2022 surge in profits among ExxonMobil and other large oil companies, partly due to the war in Ukraine,[124][125] U.S. President Joe Biden criticized ExxonMobil. In June 2022, amid record oil prices, he said that \"Exxon made more money than God this year\".[126] When the oil giant reported its second quarter earnings in 2022, CNN reported that Exxon made US$2,245.62 per second in profit across the 92-day long second quarter.[127]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Esso\n* History of ExxonMobil\n* Litigation involving ExxonMobil:\n\t+ *Connecticut v.

Its revenue in the same period rose 2% year-on-year to $83 billion, though this figure was also lower than in 2021, where the increase was at 36%.

According to *The New York Times*, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the \"Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich\", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.[306][307]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n284. **^** Goel, Vindu (November 20, 2016). \"How Apple Empowers, and Employs, the American Working Class\". *The New York Times*.

He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues.

Offering insurance services under UnitedHealthcare and healthcare products under Optum, it is the world's eleventh-largest company by revenue and the largest healthcare company by revenue, and the largest insurance company by net premiums. Optum and UnitedHealthcare had roughly equal earnings from operations in 2022.\n\n\nThe company is ranked 10th on the 2023 Fortune Global 500. UnitedHealth Group had a market capitalization of $477.4 billion as of August 7, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealth Group has origins dating back to late 1974 with the founding of Minnesota-based Charter Med Incorporated by Richard Taylor Burke. It originally processed claims for doctors at the Hennepin County Medical Society.[3] United HealthCare Corporation was founded in 1977 to purchase Charter Med and create a network-based health plan for seniors.[4] It became a publicly traded company in 1984 and changed its name to UnitedHealth Group in 1998.[5]\n\n\nIn 1988, United HealthCare started its first pharmacy benefit management, through its Diversified Pharmaceutical Services subsidiary. It managed pharmacy benefits delivered both through retail pharmacies and mail. The subsidiary was sold to SmithKline Beecham in 1994 for $2.3 billion.[6]\n\n\nIn 1994, United HealthCare acquired Ramsey-HMO, a Florida insurer.[7] In 1995, the company acquired The MetraHealth Companies Inc. for $1.65 billion. MetraHealth was a privately held company formed by combining the group healthcare operations of The Travelers Companies and MetLife. In 1996, United HealthCare acquired HealthWise of America, which operated HMOs in Arkansas, Maryland, Kentucky and Tennessee.[8]\n\n\nIn 1998, the company was reorganized as the holding of independent companies UnitedHealthcare, Ovations, Uniprise, Specialized Care Services and Ingenix, and rebranded as \"UnitedHealth Group\". Also in 1998, United Health Group acquired HealthPartners of Arizona, operator of Arizona's largest AHCCCS provider.[9]\n\n\nIn 2001, EverCare, a UnitedHealth Group subsidiary, merged with LifeMark Health Plans[10] In 2002, UnitedHealth Group acquired GeoAccess and Medicaid insurance company AmeriChoice.[11] In 2003, UnitedHealth Group acquired Mid Atlantic Medical Services, an insurer serving Maryland, Washington D.C., Virginia, Delaware and West Virginia.[12] Also in 2003, UnitedHealth Group acquired Golden Rule Financial, a provider of health savings accounts.[13] On July 21, 2003, Exante Bank started operating in Salt Lake City, Utah, as a Utah state-chartered industrial loan corporation. It changed its name to OptumHealth Bank in 2008[14] and to Optum Bank in 2012.\n\n\nIn April 2004, UnitedHealth Group acquired Touchpoint Health Plan, a Wisconsin health plan.[15] In July 2004, the company acquired Oxford Health Plans.[16]\n\n\nIn December 2005, the company acquired PacifiCare Health Systems.[17] It agreed to divest parts of PacifiCare's commercial health insurance business in Tucson, Arizona and Boulder, Colorado to satisfy antitrust regulator concerns, and also agreed to end its network access agreement with Blue Shield of California. The Tucson business was sold to Cigna.[18] The company acquired Prescription Solutions, another pharmacy benefits manager, as part of its acquisition of PacifiCare Health Systems.[19] This business was later rebranded OptumRx.\n\n\nIn February 2006, the company acquired John Deere Health Care.[20][21][22] The same year, William W. McGuire stepped down as chairman and director due to his involvement in the employee stock options scandal.[23] He was replaced by CEO Stephen Hemsley who had served as president and COO and a member of the board of directors. McGuire's exit compensation from UnitedHealth was anticipated to be $1.1 billion,[24] but he only received $618 million after returning $420 million in stock options.[25]\n\n\nIn February 2008, the company acquired Sierra Health Services for $2.6 billion.[26] As part of the transaction, to obtain regulatory approval, 25,000 customers were sold to Humana.[27] In July 2009, UnitedHealth Group agreed to acquire Health Net's Northeast licensed subsidiaries for up to $570 million in payments spread out over two years.[28] Through 2010 and into 2011, senior executives of the company met monthly with executives of other health insurers to limit the effect of the health care reform law.[29]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Ingenix acquired Picis Clinical Solutions, Inc., a health information provider for the high-acuity areas of hospitals.[30][31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Former LHI buildings in La Crosse\nIn 2011, Logistics Health, Inc. of La Crosse, Wisconsin, was acquired by OptumHealth.[32] In September 2014, the office buildings where LHI is based were sold to UnitedHealth Group for $45 million.[33][34]\n\n\nIn February 2012, the company acquired XLHealth, a sponsor of Medicare Advantage health plans with a primary focus on medicare recipients with special needs such as those with chronic illness and those eligible for Medicaid (\"dual eligibles\").[35] In October 2012, UnitedHealth Group and Amil Participações, one of the biggest Brazilian health insurance companies, completed the first phase of their merger.[36][37][38]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Optum secured a majority stake in the Washington, D.C.-based startup Audax Health.[39] Audax's CEO, Grant Verstandig, continued running the firm alongside COO David Ko.[39] In October 2014, Optum Health acquired the health services unit of Alere for $600 million cash.[40]\n\n\nIn March 2015, it was announced that CatamaranRx would be acquired by OptumRx.[41]\n\n\nIn April 2016, the company announced it was pulling out of all but a \"handful\" of state healthcare exchanges provided under Affordable Care Act and will continue to sell only in three states in 2017.[42][43]\n\n\nIn 2017, UnitedHealth's Optum unit acquired Rally Health,[44] a company started by Audax Health's executives.[45] Prior to acquisition, in 2015, UnitedHealth supported Rally Health as a majority investor,[46] and through enrolling 5 million UnitedHealth policy holders in Rally Health's flagship product, RallySM.[45][47][nt 1] The close relations between UnitedHealth, Audax Health and Rally Health follows a close personal relationship between Grant Vrestandig (Audax and Rally) and UnitedHealth's President and CFO at the time, David Wichmann.[48]\n\n\nIn June 2019, UnitedHealth's Optum division acquired Davita Medical Group from DaVita Inc. for $4.3 billion.[49][50][51] That year, the company also agreed to acquire Equian for $3.2 billion.[52][53][54][55] On June 19, 2019, UnitedHealth acquired the online patient community platform PatientsLikeMe for an undisclosed amount and it will be incorporated into UnitedHealth Group's research division.[56]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Andrew Witty was named president of UnitedHealth, in addition to his role as chief executive of the company's Optum division.[57]\n\n\nUnitedHealth announced in March 2022 that it would acquire LHC Group for $5.4 billion. The deal will expand its home health capabilities by combining LHC's services with UnitedHealth's Optum unit.[58]\n\n\nIn 2022, UnitedHealth Group said there would be no out-of-pocket costs for albuterol, epinephrine, glucagon, insulin, and naloxone for fully insured members starting in 2023. The discounts were guaranteed for less than a quarter of UnitedHealthcare's membership.[59]\n\n\n\n## Organizational structure[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealth Group has two subsidiaries: Optum and UnitedHealthcare.\n\n\n\n### Optum[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Optum\n\nFormed in 2011, Optum says that it provides \"data and analytics, pharmacy care services, population health, healthcare delivery and healthcare operations\".[60]\n\n\nIt is organized into three businesses:\n\n\n\n* OptumHealth – provides primary and secondary care.[60][61]\n* OptumInsight – provides data analytics, technology, and operations services.[60]\n* OptumRX – provides pharmacy services and also.[60]\n\n\n### UnitedHealthcare[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo for UnitedHealthcare\n**UnitedHealthcare** is an insurance and managed care company with four main divisions:\n\n\n\n* UnitedHealthcare Employer and Individual – provides health benefit plans and services for large national employers.\n* UnitedHealthcare Medicare and Retirement – provides health and well-being services to individuals age 65 and older.[62]\n* UnitedHealthcare Community and State – serves state programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved, and people without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program.[62]\n* UnitedHealthcare Global – serves 6.2 million people with medical benefits, residing principally in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru but also in more than 130 other countries.[62]\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\n### Health insurance plans[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare offers commercial group insurance plans across the United States under several product names with different offerings.[63]\n\n\n\n* **UnitedHealthcare Select** is an exclusive provider organization (EPO) with no coverage for out-of-network providers[64]\n* **UnitedHealthcare Select Plus** is a preferred provider organization (PPO).[64]\n* **UnitedHealthcare Choice** functions as a HMO plan with access to specialists,[64] whereas UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus is a plan which allows for out-of-network coverage.[64]\n* **UnitedHealthcare Navigate, Charter, and Compass** require a primary care physician referral to see a specialist[63] meaning that they are more restrictive managed care plans, similar to point of service plans.\n\n\n#### Provider networks[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare negotiates with providers in periodic contract negotiation; contracts may be discontinued from time to time.[63] High-profile contract disputes can span provider networks across the nation, as in the case of a 2018 dispute with a major emergency room doctor group, Envision Healthcare.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Provider directory[edit]\n\n\nMaintaining up-to-date provider directories is necessary since the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can fine insurers with outdated directories.[66] As a condition of participation, UnitedHealthcare requires that providers notify them of changes, but also has a Professional Verification Outreach program to proactively request information from providers.[63] However, providers are burdened by having to maintain their information with multiple networks (e.g., competitors to UnitedHealthcare). The total cost of maintaining these directories is estimated at $2.1b annually, and a blockchain initiative began in 2018 to share the directory.[66]\n\n\n\n## Finance[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2022, UnitedHealth Group reported earnings of US$20.64 billion, with an annual revenue of US$324.16 billion.[67]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenuein million US$\n | Net incomein million US$\n | Total assetsin million US$\n | Price per sharein US$\n | Employees\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2005[68] | 46,425\n | 3,083\n | 41,288\n | 45.24\n |  |\n| 2006[69] | 71,542\n | 4,159\n | 48,320\n | 44.83\n |  |\n| 2007[70] | 75,431\n | 4,654\n | 50,899\n | 45.91\n |  |\n| 2008[71] | 81,186\n | 2,977\n | 55,815\n | 28.40\n |  |\n| 2009[72] | 87,138\n | 3,822\n | 59,045\n | 23.10\n | 80,000\n |\n| 2010[73] | 94,155\n | 4,634\n | 63,063\n | 29.20\n | 87,000\n |\n| 2011[74] | 101,862\n | 5,142\n | 67,889\n | 41.68\n | 99,000\n |\n| 2012[75] | 110,618\n | 5,526\n | 80,885\n | 50.04\n | 133,000\n |\n| 2013[76] | 122,489\n | 5,625\n | 81,882\n | 60.29\n | 156,000\n |\n| 2014[77] | 130,474\n | 5,619\n | 86,382\n | 78.28\n | 170,000\n |\n| 2015[78] | 157,107\n | 5,813\n | 111,254\n | 111.06\n | 200,000\n |\n| 2016[79] | 184,840\n | 7,017\n | 122,810\n | 131.31\n | 230,000\n |\n| 2017[80] | 201,159\n | 10,558\n | 139,058\n | 183.48\n | 260,000\n |\n| 2018[81] | 226,247\n | 11,986\n | 152,221\n | 245.88\n | 300,000\n |\n| 2019[82] | 242,155\n | 13,839\n | 173,889\n | 249.59\n | 325,000\n |\n| 2020[82] | 257,141\n | 15,403\n | 197,289\n | 301.28\n | 330,000\n |\n| 2021[82] | 287,597\n | 17,285\n | 212,206\n | 403.71\n | 350,000\n |\n| 2022[82] | 324,162\n | 20,639\n | 245,705\n |  | 400,000\n |\n\n\n## Criticism and controversies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

UnitedHealth Group subsequently spent $2.75 million to $4.86 million from 2011 to 2021 and the company went on to pull in $78,692 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 alone.[83]\n\n\nThe UnitedHealth Group hired seven different lobbying firms to work on its behalf in 2010.[84] In addition, its corporate political action committee or PAC, called **United for Health,** spent an additional $1 million on lobbying activities in 2010.[85]\n\n\nQSSI, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, is one of the 55 contractors hired by the United States Department of Health and Human Services to work on the HealthCare.gov web site.[86]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth Group's management and directors, for backdating of stock options. Investigations were also begun by the Internal Revenue Service and prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, who subpoenaed documents from the company. The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the *Wall Street Journal* in May 2006, discussing apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock options by UHC management. The backdating apparently occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, according to the *Journal*. Major shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean and UHC's other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty.[87] On October 15, 2006, CEO William W. McGuire was forced to resign, and relinquish hundreds of millions of dollars in stock options. On December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire will repay $468 million, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution.[88][89][90]\n\n\nOn December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire was to repay $468 million, including a $7 million civil penalty, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution. He was also barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years.[91][92][93] This was the first time in which the little-used \"clawback\" provision under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was used against an individual by the SEC. The SEC continued its investigations even after it in 2008 settled legal actions against both UnitedHealth Group itself and its former general counsel.[94]\n\n\nIn June 2006, the American Chiropractic Association filed a national class-action lawsuit against the American Chiropractic Network (ACN), which is owned by UnitedHealth Group and administers chiropractic benefits, and against UnitedHealth Group itself, for alleged practices in violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).[95]\n\n\n\n#### OptumInsight, aka Ingenix[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2008, New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced an industry-wide investigation into a scheme by health insurers to defraud consumers by manipulating reasonable and customary rates. The announcement included a statement that Cuomo intended \"to file suit against Ingenix, Inc., its parent UnitedHealth Group, and three additional subsidiaries.\" Cuomo asserted that his investigation found that rates found in a database of health care charges maintained by Ingenix were lower than what he determined was the actual cost of certain medical expenses. Cuomo said this inappropriately allowed health insurance companies to deny a portion of provider claims, thereby pushing costs down to members.[96]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2009, Ingenix announced an agreement with the New York State attorney settling the probe into the independence of the health pricing database. Under the settlement, UnitedHealth Group and Ingenix would pay $50 million to finance a new, non-profit entity that would develop a new health care pricing database. Ingenix would discontinue its medical pricing databases when the new entity makes its product available. The company acknowledged the appearance of a conflict of interest but admitted no wrongdoing.[97]\n\n\nOn January 15, 2009, UnitedHealth Group announced a $350 million settlement of three class action lawsuits filed in Federal court by the American Medical Association, UnitedHealth Group members, healthcare providers, and state medical societies for not paying out-of-network benefits. This settlement came two days after a similar settlement with Cuomo.[98]\n\n\nOn October 27, 2009, Cuomo announced the creation of FAIR Health, the independent, non-profit organization that will develop a nationwide database for consumer reimbursement, as well as a website where consumers will be able to compare prices before they choose doctors. To fund FAIR Health, the Attorney General's office secured nearly $100 million from insurers such as Aetna, UnitedHealth Group, and Anthem Inc.[99]\n\n\n\n#### Investigations and lawsuits[edit]\n\n\n#### Medicare overbilling lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nA whistleblower lawsuit, filed in 2011, charges UnitedHealth Group's data analytics division with assisting in defrauding Medicare by boosting risk adjustment scores from Medicare Advantage companies. The suit alleges that UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Ingenix (now OptumInsight) \"defrauded the United States of hundreds of millions — and likely billions — of dollars.\" Former UnitedHealth executive Benjamin Poehling brought the suit under the False Claims Act. The government said it would proceed on claims against two health care companies, UnitedHealth and its Texas subsidiary WellMed Medical Management. In February 2017, a federal judge unsealed the suit after the Department of Justice announced it would join the case.[100][101]\n\n\n\n#### *Richard Cole, and others v. United Healthcare*[edit]\n\n\nOn April 29, 2019, Judge Robert N. Scola Jr. of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, a cancer survivor, recused himself from a case against United Healthcare, stating that the company's denial of treatment was \"immoral and barbaric\", and that his opinions regarding the company would prevent him from \"deciding this case fairly and impartially.\"[102][103]\n\n\n\n#### PacifiCare fine in California[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the California Department of Insurance took action against UnitedHealthcare's subsidiary PacifiCare Health Systems, acquired in 2005, ultimately fining UnitedHealthcare around $173 million for an estimated over 900,000 violations of the Unfair Insurance Practices Act; by 2019, the case was still being disputed in court, with the possibility of affirming $91 million in penalties.[104]\n\n\n\n#### CMS fine over Medicare Part D[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, CMS fined UnitedHealthcare after discovering issues in Medicare Part D leading to delays or denials in a 2016 audit.[105]\n\n\n\n#### New Jersey fine in 2018[edit]\n\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance fined UnitedHealthcare $2.5 million due to various compliance issues; this was the largest fine against a licensee in nine years.[106]\n\n\n\n#### Pennsylvania[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare assessed $1 million penalty for claims payment violations.[107]\n\n\n\n#### Northern California[edit]\n\n\nUnited Behavioral Health sued over $5 million in denied claims.[108]\n\n\n\n#### Policy Research ownership[edit]\n\n\nThe Lewin Group is a policy research and consulting firm that provides an economic analysis of health care and human services issues and policies.[109]\nThe organization has existed for about 40 years and has maintained a nonpartisan reputation through its many ownership changes that have occurred over that time.[109]\nThe Lewin Group was purchased in 2007 by Ingenix, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, but alleges editorial and analytical \"independence\" from UnitedHealth Group, its parent company.[109]\nThe Lewin Group discloses its ownership in its reports and on its website. While the Lewin Group does not advocate for or against any legislation, both Democratic and Republican politicians frequently cite the firm's studies to argue for and against various U.S. healthcare reform proposals.[110] For example, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden uses Lewin Group estimates to cite the feasibility of his Healthy Americans Act.[111] Former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, the former House Republican Whip, has referred to the organization as \"the nonpartisan Lewin Group\" in arguing against government-funded health insurance proposals.\n\n\nSeveral Lewin studies have been used to argue both for and against the inclusion of a public option in national health reform. Lewin clients who often cite its findings include The Commonwealth Fund which recently held up a Lewin study it commissioned to advocate for a public plan. The report showed that legislative proposals would achieve nearly universal coverage and \"estimated that a public plan could offer small businesses insurance that is at least 9 percent cheaper than current small-business policies.\"[112]\n\n\nHowever, The Lewin Group has acknowledged that clients sometimes choose not to publicize the results of studies they have commissioned. Indeed, Lewin Group Vice President John Sheils told *The Washington Post* that \"sometimes studies come out that don't show exactly what the client wants to see. And in those instances, they have [the] option to bury the study.\"[113]\n\n\n\n#### Influencing the research of Yale University economist Zack Cooper[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2021, a report from *The Intercept* revealed that UnitedHealthcare worked behind the scenes to guide Yale University healthcare economist Zack Cooper's research on surprise medical billing.[114] United provided Cooper with anonymous data and made edits to his paper, which blamed physician networks TeamHealth and EmCare for the rise in balance billing. United Health Network CEO Dan Rosenthal later confirmed United's work with Cooper during a deposition in a lawsuit filed against United by TeamHealth.[115] Cooper's work was presented as independent, unbiased academic research before Congress, the White House, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and numerous media reports.[116]\n\n\n\n#### Underpaying physicians[edit]\n\n\nIn late 2021, Tennessee-based physician network TeamHealth sued UnitedHealthcare in the 8th District Court of Clark County, Nevada, alleging the insurer underpaid claims to three of TeamHealth's Nevada-based affiliates. In November 2021, the jury unanimously found United guilty of \"oppression, fraud, and malice\" in its conduct and awarded TeamHealth $2.65 million in compensatory damages.[117] In December, the jury reconvened to determine punitive damages and awarded TeamHealth $60 million.[118] TeamHealth plans to pursue similar legal action against United and other insurers in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Change Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2022, the United States Department of Justice sued to stop UnitedHealth Group's $8 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare, arguing that the deal would give UnitedHealth access to its competitors' data and ultimately push up healthcare cost. The Justice Department said that UnitedHealth knew that access to claims would give it a view into rival health plans at Humana, Anthem Inc, CVS Health, Aetna, and Cigna.[120] A U.S. judge rejected the department's bid in September. Following completion of the acquisition in October 2022, the parties agreed that the appeal would be voluntarily dismissed, with the Justice Department not providing reasons for dropping the appeal.[121]\n\n\n\n#### Medicare Advantage Overbilling[edit]\n\n\nThe New York Times report in October 2021 identified UnitedHealth in a list of Medicare insurers accused of over-billing. UnitedHealth has been accused by a whistle blower, accused of fraud by the U.S. government and over-billed according to the Inspector General. Executives at UnitedHealth Group told workers to mine old medical records for more illnesses, to identify diagnoses of serious diseases that might have never existed, inflating bills paid by the federal government's Medicare Advantage program.[122]\n\n\nA study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that in 2021, Medicare Advantage programs provided insurers with double the gross margin than insurance for individuals, groups, or Medicaid Managed Care.[123][124]\n\n\n\n## Foundations[edit]\n\n\nFoundations affiliated with UnitedHealth Group include the United Health Foundation (UHF) and the UnitedHealthcare Children's Foundation (UHCCF), both of which were established in 1999.[125]\n\n\nUHF pledged $100 million over ten years to fund scholarships and workforce development programs focused on increasing ethnic and racial diversity within the health care industry.[126]\n\n\nUHCCF administers grants to help pay for medical costs for families with coverage gaps. According to UHCCF, the foundation raises money for medical grants by selling gift items such as backpacks, books, cards, and games, some of which are created by children.[127]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* America's Health Rankings (reports released annually in conjunction with UnitedHealth Group's United Health Foundation since 1990)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Also referred to as Rally.(Staff (February 3, 2015). \"Rally Health Launches Digital Wellness Platform With Over 5M People\". *HIT Consultant*.

Offering insurance services under UnitedHealthcare and healthcare products under Optum, it is the world's eleventh-largest company by revenue and the largest healthcare company by revenue, and the largest insurance company by net premiums. Optum and UnitedHealthcare had roughly equal earnings from operations in 2022.\n\n\nThe company is ranked 10th on the 2023 Fortune Global 500. UnitedHealth Group had a market capitalization of $477.4 billion as of August 7, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealth Group has origins dating back to late 1974 with the founding of Minnesota-based Charter Med Incorporated by Richard Taylor Burke. It originally processed claims for doctors at the Hennepin County Medical Society.[3] United HealthCare Corporation was founded in 1977 to purchase Charter Med and create a network-based health plan for seniors.[4] It became a publicly traded company in 1984 and changed its name to UnitedHealth Group in 1998.[5]\n\n\nIn 1988, United HealthCare started its first pharmacy benefit management, through its Diversified Pharmaceutical Services subsidiary. It managed pharmacy benefits delivered both through retail pharmacies and mail. The subsidiary was sold to SmithKline Beecham in 1994 for $2.3 billion.[6]\n\n\nIn 1994, United HealthCare acquired Ramsey-HMO, a Florida insurer.[7] In 1995, the company acquired The MetraHealth Companies Inc. for $1.65 billion. MetraHealth was a privately held company formed by combining the group healthcare operations of The Travelers Companies and MetLife. In 1996, United HealthCare acquired HealthWise of America, which operated HMOs in Arkansas, Maryland, Kentucky and Tennessee.[8]\n\n\nIn 1998, the company was reorganized as the holding of independent companies UnitedHealthcare, Ovations, Uniprise, Specialized Care Services and Ingenix, and rebranded as \"UnitedHealth Group\". Also in 1998, United Health Group acquired HealthPartners of Arizona, operator of Arizona's largest AHCCCS provider.[9]\n\n\nIn 2001, EverCare, a UnitedHealth Group subsidiary, merged with LifeMark Health Plans[10] In 2002, UnitedHealth Group acquired GeoAccess and Medicaid insurance company AmeriChoice.[11] In 2003, UnitedHealth Group acquired Mid Atlantic Medical Services, an insurer serving Maryland, Washington D.C., Virginia, Delaware and West Virginia.[12] Also in 2003, UnitedHealth Group acquired Golden Rule Financial, a provider of health savings accounts.[13] On July 21, 2003, Exante Bank started operating in Salt Lake City, Utah, as a Utah state-chartered industrial loan corporation. It changed its name to OptumHealth Bank in 2008[14] and to Optum Bank in 2012.\n\n\nIn April 2004, UnitedHealth Group acquired Touchpoint Health Plan, a Wisconsin health plan.[15] In July 2004, the company acquired Oxford Health Plans.[16]\n\n\nIn December 2005, the company acquired PacifiCare Health Systems.[17] It agreed to divest parts of PacifiCare's commercial health insurance business in Tucson, Arizona and Boulder, Colorado to satisfy antitrust regulator concerns, and also agreed to end its network access agreement with Blue Shield of California. The Tucson business was sold to Cigna.[18] The company acquired Prescription Solutions, another pharmacy benefits manager, as part of its acquisition of PacifiCare Health Systems.[19] This business was later rebranded OptumRx.\n\n\nIn February 2006, the company acquired John Deere Health Care.[20][21][22] The same year, William W. McGuire stepped down as chairman and director due to his involvement in the employee stock options scandal.[23] He was replaced by CEO Stephen Hemsley who had served as president and COO and a member of the board of directors. McGuire's exit compensation from UnitedHealth was anticipated to be $1.1 billion,[24] but he only received $618 million after returning $420 million in stock options.[25]\n\n\nIn February 2008, the company acquired Sierra Health Services for $2.6 billion.[26] As part of the transaction, to obtain regulatory approval, 25,000 customers were sold to Humana.[27] In July 2009, UnitedHealth Group agreed to acquire Health Net's Northeast licensed subsidiaries for up to $570 million in payments spread out over two years.[28] Through 2010 and into 2011, senior executives of the company met monthly with executives of other health insurers to limit the effect of the health care reform law.[29]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Ingenix acquired Picis Clinical Solutions, Inc., a health information provider for the high-acuity areas of hospitals.[30][31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Former LHI buildings in La Crosse\nIn 2011, Logistics Health, Inc. of La Crosse, Wisconsin, was acquired by OptumHealth.[32] In September 2014, the office buildings where LHI is based were sold to UnitedHealth Group for $45 million.[33][34]\n\n\nIn February 2012, the company acquired XLHealth, a sponsor of Medicare Advantage health plans with a primary focus on medicare recipients with special needs such as those with chronic illness and those eligible for Medicaid (\"dual eligibles\").[35] In October 2012, UnitedHealth Group and Amil Participações, one of the biggest Brazilian health insurance companies, completed the first phase of their merger.[36][37][38]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Optum secured a majority stake in the Washington, D.C.-based startup Audax Health.[39] Audax's CEO, Grant Verstandig, continued running the firm alongside COO David Ko.[39] In October 2014, Optum Health acquired the health services unit of Alere for $600 million cash.[40]\n\n\nIn March 2015, it was announced that CatamaranRx would be acquired by OptumRx.[41]\n\n\nIn April 2016, the company announced it was pulling out of all but a \"handful\" of state healthcare exchanges provided under Affordable Care Act and will continue to sell only in three states in 2017.[42][43]\n\n\nIn 2017, UnitedHealth's Optum unit acquired Rally Health,[44] a company started by Audax Health's executives.[45] Prior to acquisition, in 2015, UnitedHealth supported Rally Health as a majority investor,[46] and through enrolling 5 million UnitedHealth policy holders in Rally Health's flagship product, RallySM.[45][47][nt 1] The close relations between UnitedHealth, Audax Health and Rally Health follows a close personal relationship between Grant Vrestandig (Audax and Rally) and UnitedHealth's President and CFO at the time, David Wichmann.[48]\n\n\nIn June 2019, UnitedHealth's Optum division acquired Davita Medical Group from DaVita Inc. for $4.3 billion.[49][50][51] That year, the company also agreed to acquire Equian for $3.2 billion.[52][53][54][55] On June 19, 2019, UnitedHealth acquired the online patient community platform PatientsLikeMe for an undisclosed amount and it will be incorporated into UnitedHealth Group's research division.[56]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Andrew Witty was named president of UnitedHealth, in addition to his role as chief executive of the company's Optum division.[57]\n\n\nUnitedHealth announced in March 2022 that it would acquire LHC Group for $5.4 billion. The deal will expand its home health capabilities by combining LHC's services with UnitedHealth's Optum unit.[58]\n\n\nIn 2022, UnitedHealth Group said there would be no out-of-pocket costs for albuterol, epinephrine, glucagon, insulin, and naloxone for fully insured members starting in 2023. The discounts were guaranteed for less than a quarter of UnitedHealthcare's membership.[59]\n\n\n\n## Organizational structure[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealth Group has two subsidiaries: Optum and UnitedHealthcare.\n\n\n\n### Optum[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Optum\n\nFormed in 2011, Optum says that it provides \"data and analytics, pharmacy care services, population health, healthcare delivery and healthcare operations\".[60]\n\n\nIt is organized into three businesses:\n\n\n\n* OptumHealth – provides primary and secondary care.[60][61]\n* OptumInsight – provides data analytics, technology, and operations services.[60]\n* OptumRX – provides pharmacy services and also.[60]\n\n\n### UnitedHealthcare[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo for UnitedHealthcare\n**UnitedHealthcare** is an insurance and managed care company with four main divisions:\n\n\n\n* UnitedHealthcare Employer and Individual – provides health benefit plans and services for large national employers.\n* UnitedHealthcare Medicare and Retirement – provides health and well-being services to individuals age 65 and older.[62]\n* UnitedHealthcare Community and State – serves state programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved, and people without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program.[62]\n* UnitedHealthcare Global – serves 6.2 million people with medical benefits, residing principally in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru but also in more than 130 other countries.[62]\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\n### Health insurance plans[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare offers commercial group insurance plans across the United States under several product names with different offerings.[63]\n\n\n\n* **UnitedHealthcare Select** is an exclusive provider organization (EPO) with no coverage for out-of-network providers[64]\n* **UnitedHealthcare Select Plus** is a preferred provider organization (PPO).[64]\n* **UnitedHealthcare Choice** functions as a HMO plan with access to specialists,[64] whereas UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus is a plan which allows for out-of-network coverage.[64]\n* **UnitedHealthcare Navigate, Charter, and Compass** require a primary care physician referral to see a specialist[63] meaning that they are more restrictive managed care plans, similar to point of service plans.\n\n\n#### Provider networks[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare negotiates with providers in periodic contract negotiation; contracts may be discontinued from time to time.[63] High-profile contract disputes can span provider networks across the nation, as in the case of a 2018 dispute with a major emergency room doctor group, Envision Healthcare.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Provider directory[edit]\n\n\nMaintaining up-to-date provider directories is necessary since the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can fine insurers with outdated directories.[66] As a condition of participation, UnitedHealthcare requires that providers notify them of changes, but also has a Professional Verification Outreach program to proactively request information from providers.[63] However, providers are burdened by having to maintain their information with multiple networks (e.g., competitors to UnitedHealthcare). The total cost of maintaining these directories is estimated at $2.1b annually, and a blockchain initiative began in 2018 to share the directory.[66]\n\n\n\n## Finance[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2022, UnitedHealth Group reported earnings of US$20.64 billion, with an annual revenue of US$324.16 billion.[67]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenuein million US$\n | Net incomein million US$\n | Total assetsin million US$\n | Price per sharein US$\n | Employees\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2005[68] | 46,425\n | 3,083\n | 41,288\n | 45.24\n |  |\n| 2006[69] | 71,542\n | 4,159\n | 48,320\n | 44.83\n |  |\n| 2007[70] | 75,431\n | 4,654\n | 50,899\n | 45.91\n |  |\n| 2008[71] | 81,186\n | 2,977\n | 55,815\n | 28.40\n |  |\n| 2009[72] | 87,138\n | 3,822\n | 59,045\n | 23.10\n | 80,000\n |\n| 2010[73] | 94,155\n | 4,634\n | 63,063\n | 29.20\n | 87,000\n |\n| 2011[74] | 101,862\n | 5,142\n | 67,889\n | 41.68\n | 99,000\n |\n| 2012[75] | 110,618\n | 5,526\n | 80,885\n | 50.04\n | 133,000\n |\n| 2013[76] | 122,489\n | 5,625\n | 81,882\n | 60.29\n | 156,000\n |\n| 2014[77] | 130,474\n | 5,619\n | 86,382\n | 78.28\n | 170,000\n |\n| 2015[78] | 157,107\n | 5,813\n | 111,254\n | 111.06\n | 200,000\n |\n| 2016[79] | 184,840\n | 7,017\n | 122,810\n | 131.31\n | 230,000\n |\n| 2017[80] | 201,159\n | 10,558\n | 139,058\n | 183.48\n | 260,000\n |\n| 2018[81] | 226,247\n | 11,986\n | 152,221\n | 245.88\n | 300,000\n |\n| 2019[82] | 242,155\n | 13,839\n | 173,889\n | 249.59\n | 325,000\n |\n| 2020[82] | 257,141\n | 15,403\n | 197,289\n | 301.28\n | 330,000\n |\n| 2021[82] | 287,597\n | 17,285\n | 212,206\n | 403.71\n | 350,000\n |\n| 2022[82] | 324,162\n | 20,639\n | 245,705\n |  | 400,000\n |\n\n\n## Criticism and controversies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

UnitedHealth Group subsequently spent $2.75 million to $4.86 million from 2011 to 2021 and the company went on to pull in $78,692 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 alone.[83]\n\n\nThe UnitedHealth Group hired seven different lobbying firms to work on its behalf in 2010.[84] In addition, its corporate political action committee or PAC, called **United for Health,** spent an additional $1 million on lobbying activities in 2010.[85]\n\n\nQSSI, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, is one of the 55 contractors hired by the United States Department of Health and Human Services to work on the HealthCare.gov web site.[86]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth Group's management and directors, for backdating of stock options. Investigations were also begun by the Internal Revenue Service and prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, who subpoenaed documents from the company. The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the *Wall Street Journal* in May 2006, discussing apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock options by UHC management. The backdating apparently occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, according to the *Journal*. Major shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean and UHC's other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty.[87] On October 15, 2006, CEO William W. McGuire was forced to resign, and relinquish hundreds of millions of dollars in stock options. On December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire will repay $468 million, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution.[88][89][90]\n\n\nOn December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire was to repay $468 million, including a $7 million civil penalty, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution. He was also barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years.[91][92][93] This was the first time in which the little-used \"clawback\" provision under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was used against an individual by the SEC. The SEC continued its investigations even after it in 2008 settled legal actions against both UnitedHealth Group itself and its former general counsel.[94]\n\n\nIn June 2006, the American Chiropractic Association filed a national class-action lawsuit against the American Chiropractic Network (ACN), which is owned by UnitedHealth Group and administers chiropractic benefits, and against UnitedHealth Group itself, for alleged practices in violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).[95]\n\n\n\n#### OptumInsight, aka Ingenix[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2008, New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced an industry-wide investigation into a scheme by health insurers to defraud consumers by manipulating reasonable and customary rates. The announcement included a statement that Cuomo intended \"to file suit against Ingenix, Inc., its parent UnitedHealth Group, and three additional subsidiaries.\" Cuomo asserted that his investigation found that rates found in a database of health care charges maintained by Ingenix were lower than what he determined was the actual cost of certain medical expenses. Cuomo said this inappropriately allowed health insurance companies to deny a portion of provider claims, thereby pushing costs down to members.[96]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2009, Ingenix announced an agreement with the New York State attorney settling the probe into the independence of the health pricing database. Under the settlement, UnitedHealth Group and Ingenix would pay $50 million to finance a new, non-profit entity that would develop a new health care pricing database. Ingenix would discontinue its medical pricing databases when the new entity makes its product available. The company acknowledged the appearance of a conflict of interest but admitted no wrongdoing.[97]\n\n\nOn January 15, 2009, UnitedHealth Group announced a $350 million settlement of three class action lawsuits filed in Federal court by the American Medical Association, UnitedHealth Group members, healthcare providers, and state medical societies for not paying out-of-network benefits. This settlement came two days after a similar settlement with Cuomo.[98]\n\n\nOn October 27, 2009, Cuomo announced the creation of FAIR Health, the independent, non-profit organization that will develop a nationwide database for consumer reimbursement, as well as a website where consumers will be able to compare prices before they choose doctors. To fund FAIR Health, the Attorney General's office secured nearly $100 million from insurers such as Aetna, UnitedHealth Group, and Anthem Inc.[99]\n\n\n\n#### Investigations and lawsuits[edit]\n\n\n#### Medicare overbilling lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nA whistleblower lawsuit, filed in 2011, charges UnitedHealth Group's data analytics division with assisting in defrauding Medicare by boosting risk adjustment scores from Medicare Advantage companies. The suit alleges that UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Ingenix (now OptumInsight) \"defrauded the United States of hundreds of millions — and likely billions — of dollars.\" Former UnitedHealth executive Benjamin Poehling brought the suit under the False Claims Act. The government said it would proceed on claims against two health care companies, UnitedHealth and its Texas subsidiary WellMed Medical Management. In February 2017, a federal judge unsealed the suit after the Department of Justice announced it would join the case.[100][101]\n\n\n\n#### *Richard Cole, and others v. United Healthcare*[edit]\n\n\nOn April 29, 2019, Judge Robert N. Scola Jr. of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, a cancer survivor, recused himself from a case against United Healthcare, stating that the company's denial of treatment was \"immoral and barbaric\", and that his opinions regarding the company would prevent him from \"deciding this case fairly and impartially.\"[102][103]\n\n\n\n#### PacifiCare fine in California[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the California Department of Insurance took action against UnitedHealthcare's subsidiary PacifiCare Health Systems, acquired in 2005, ultimately fining UnitedHealthcare around $173 million for an estimated over 900,000 violations of the Unfair Insurance Practices Act; by 2019, the case was still being disputed in court, with the possibility of affirming $91 million in penalties.[104]\n\n\n\n#### CMS fine over Medicare Part D[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, CMS fined UnitedHealthcare after discovering issues in Medicare Part D leading to delays or denials in a 2016 audit.[105]\n\n\n\n#### New Jersey fine in 2018[edit]\n\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance fined UnitedHealthcare $2.5 million due to various compliance issues; this was the largest fine against a licensee in nine years.[106]\n\n\n\n#### Pennsylvania[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare assessed $1 million penalty for claims payment violations.[107]\n\n\n\n#### Northern California[edit]\n\n\nUnited Behavioral Health sued over $5 million in denied claims.[108]\n\n\n\n#### Policy Research ownership[edit]\n\n\nThe Lewin Group is a policy research and consulting firm that provides an economic analysis of health care and human services issues and policies.[109]\nThe organization has existed for about 40 years and has maintained a nonpartisan reputation through its many ownership changes that have occurred over that time.[109]\nThe Lewin Group was purchased in 2007 by Ingenix, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, but alleges editorial and analytical \"independence\" from UnitedHealth Group, its parent company.[109]\nThe Lewin Group discloses its ownership in its reports and on its website. While the Lewin Group does not advocate for or against any legislation, both Democratic and Republican politicians frequently cite the firm's studies to argue for and against various U.S. healthcare reform proposals.[110] For example, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden uses Lewin Group estimates to cite the feasibility of his Healthy Americans Act.[111] Former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, the former House Republican Whip, has referred to the organization as \"the nonpartisan Lewin Group\" in arguing against government-funded health insurance proposals.\n\n\nSeveral Lewin studies have been used to argue both for and against the inclusion of a public option in national health reform. Lewin clients who often cite its findings include The Commonwealth Fund which recently held up a Lewin study it commissioned to advocate for a public plan. The report showed that legislative proposals would achieve nearly universal coverage and \"estimated that a public plan could offer small businesses insurance that is at least 9 percent cheaper than current small-business policies.\"[112]\n\n\nHowever, The Lewin Group has acknowledged that clients sometimes choose not to publicize the results of studies they have commissioned. Indeed, Lewin Group Vice President John Sheils told *The Washington Post* that \"sometimes studies come out that don't show exactly what the client wants to see. And in those instances, they have [the] option to bury the study.\"[113]\n\n\n\n#### Influencing the research of Yale University economist Zack Cooper[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2021, a report from *The Intercept* revealed that UnitedHealthcare worked behind the scenes to guide Yale University healthcare economist Zack Cooper's research on surprise medical billing.[114] United provided Cooper with anonymous data and made edits to his paper, which blamed physician networks TeamHealth and EmCare for the rise in balance billing. United Health Network CEO Dan Rosenthal later confirmed United's work with Cooper during a deposition in a lawsuit filed against United by TeamHealth.[115] Cooper's work was presented as independent, unbiased academic research before Congress, the White House, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and numerous media reports.[116]\n\n\n\n#### Underpaying physicians[edit]\n\n\nIn late 2021, Tennessee-based physician network TeamHealth sued UnitedHealthcare in the 8th District Court of Clark County, Nevada, alleging the insurer underpaid claims to three of TeamHealth's Nevada-based affiliates. In November 2021, the jury unanimously found United guilty of \"oppression, fraud, and malice\" in its conduct and awarded TeamHealth $2.65 million in compensatory damages.[117] In December, the jury reconvened to determine punitive damages and awarded TeamHealth $60 million.[118] TeamHealth plans to pursue similar legal action against United and other insurers in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Change Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2022, the United States Department of Justice sued to stop UnitedHealth Group's $8 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare, arguing that the deal would give UnitedHealth access to its competitors' data and ultimately push up healthcare cost. The Justice Department said that UnitedHealth knew that access to claims would give it a view into rival health plans at Humana, Anthem Inc, CVS Health, Aetna, and Cigna.[120] A U.S. judge rejected the department's bid in September. Following completion of the acquisition in October 2022, the parties agreed that the appeal would be voluntarily dismissed, with the Justice Department not providing reasons for dropping the appeal.[121]\n\n\n\n#### Medicare Advantage Overbilling[edit]\n\n\nThe New York Times report in October 2021 identified UnitedHealth in a list of Medicare insurers accused of over-billing. UnitedHealth has been accused by a whistle blower, accused of fraud by the U.S. government and over-billed according to the Inspector General. Executives at UnitedHealth Group told workers to mine old medical records for more illnesses, to identify diagnoses of serious diseases that might have never existed, inflating bills paid by the federal government's Medicare Advantage program.[122]\n\n\nA study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that in 2021, Medicare Advantage programs provided insurers with double the gross margin than insurance for individuals, groups, or Medicaid Managed Care.[123][124]\n\n\n\n## Foundations[edit]\n\n\nFoundations affiliated with UnitedHealth Group include the United Health Foundation (UHF) and the UnitedHealthcare Children's Foundation (UHCCF), both of which were established in 1999.[125]\n\n\nUHF pledged $100 million over ten years to fund scholarships and workforce development programs focused on increasing ethnic and racial diversity within the health care industry.[126]\n\n\nUHCCF administers grants to help pay for medical costs for families with coverage gaps. According to UHCCF, the foundation raises money for medical grants by selling gift items such as backpacks, books, cards, and games, some of which are created by children.[127]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* America's Health Rankings (reports released annually in conjunction with UnitedHealth Group's United Health Foundation since 1990)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Also referred to as Rally.(Staff (February 3, 2015). \"Rally Health Launches Digital Wellness Platform With Over 5M People\". *HIT Consultant*.
