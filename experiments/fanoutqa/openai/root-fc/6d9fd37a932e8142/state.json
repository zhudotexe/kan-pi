The two principal belligerent powers were Germany and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies. Though never sending in ground troops to the Eastern Front, the United States and the United Kingdom both provided substantial material aid to the Soviet Union in the form of the Lend-Lease program along with naval and air support. The joint German\u2013Finnish operations across the northernmost Finnish\u2013Soviet border and in the Murmansk region are considered part of the Eastern Front. In addition, the Soviet\u2013Finnish Continuation War is generally also considered the northern flank of the Eastern Front.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Anschluss, Munich Agreement, and Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Dutch famine of 1944\u20131945\n |\n| 1945 | * Vistula\u2013Oder\n* Battle of Manila\n* Battle of Iwo Jima\n* Indochina\n* Vienna offensive\n* Project Hula\n* Western invasion of Germany\n* Bratislava\u2013Brno offensive\n* Battle of Okinawa\n* Second Guangxi campaign\n* West Hunan\n* Italy (Spring 1945)\n* Battle of Berlin\n* Prague offensive\n* Surrender of Germany\n\t+ document\n* Borneo\n* Taipei\n* Naval bombardment of Japan\n* Manchuria\n* Atomic bombings\n\t+ Debate\n* South Sakhalin\n* Kuril Islands\n\t+ Shumshu\n* Surrender of Japan\n\t+ Potsdam Declaration\n\t+ document\n\t+ End of World War II in Asia\n |\n\n |\n| * **![](image) World portal**\n* Bibliography\n* Category\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Eastern Front**[j] was a theatre of World War II that fought between the European Axis powers against the Soviet Union (USSR), Poland and other Allies, which encompassed Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Northeast Europe (Baltics), and Southeast Europe (Balkans) from 22 June 1941 to 9 May 1945. Of the estimated 70\u201385 million deaths attributed to World War II, around 30\u00a0million occurred on the Eastern Front, including 9 million children.[1][2] The Eastern Front was decisive in determining the outcome in the European theatre of operations in World War II, eventually serving as the main reason for the defeat of Nazi Germany and the Axis nations.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

The distinctly brutal nature of warfare on the Eastern Front was exemplified by an often wilful disregard for human life by both sides.

The war ended on 9 May 1945, when Germany's armed forces surrendered unconditionally following the Battle of Berlin (also known as the Berlin Offensive), a strategic operation executed by the Red Army.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 25 January 1945, Hitler renamed three army groups. Army Group North became Army Group Courland; Army Group Centre became Army Group North and Army Group A became Army Group Centre. Army Group North (old Army Group Centre) was driven into an ever-smaller pocket around K\u00f6nigsberg in East Prussia.\n\n\nA limited counter-attack (codenamed Operation Solstice) by the newly created Army Group Vistula, under the command of *Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS* Heinrich Himmler, had failed by 24 February, and the Red Army drove on to Pomerania and cleared the right bank of the Oder River. In the south, the German attempts, in Operation Konrad, to relieve the encircled garrison at Budapest failed and the city fell on 13 February. On 6 March, the Germans launched what would be their final major offensive of the war, Operation Spring Awakening, which failed by 16 March. On 30 March the Red Army entered Austria and captured Vienna on 13 April.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Adolf Hitler led Germany during World War II.\nHitler exercised tight control over the German war-effort, spending much of his time in his command bunkers (most notably at Rastenburg in East Prussia, at Vinnitsa in Ukraine, and under the garden of the Reich Chancellery in Berlin).

Both wings would converge on the area east of Kursk, and by that means restore the lines of Army Group South to the exact points that it held over the winter of 1941\u20131942.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Belligerents |\n| **Axis**:* **![](image)\u00a0Germany**\n* ![](image)\u00a0Romania (until 1944)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Finland (until 1944)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Hungary[a]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Italy (until 1943)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Slovakia[b]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Croatia[c]\n | **Allies**:* **![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union**\n* ![](image) Poland[d]\n* ![](image) Czechoslovakia[e]\n\n**Former Axis powers**:* ![](image)\u00a0Romania (from 1944)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Bulgaria (from 1944)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Finland (from 1944)\n\n**Support:**\n\n* ![](image)\u00a0United States[f]\n* ![](image)\u00a0British Empire[g]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Free France[h] (from 1943)\n |\n| Commanders and leaders |\n| **Axis leaders:**\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Germany's initial success at the Battle of Kiev in 1941, Hitler saw the Soviet Union as militarily weak and ripe for immediate conquest. In a speech at the Berlin Sportpalast on 3 October, he announced, \"We have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down.\"[19] Thus, Germany expected another short *Blitzkrieg* and made no serious preparations for prolonged warfare. However, following the decisive Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943 and the resulting dire German military situation, Nazi propaganda began to portray the war as a German defence of Western civilisation against destruction by the vast \"Bolshevik hordes\" that were pouring into Europe.\n\n\n\n### Soviet situation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Semyon Timoshenko and Georgy Zhukov in 1940\nSee also: Great Purge, Purge of the Red Army in 1941, Spanish Civil War, and Battles of Khalkhin Gol\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe defeat of Germany in 1945 freed approximately 11\u00a0million foreigners (categorised as \"displaced persons\"), most of whom were forced labourers and POWs.

The Red Army started the strong offensive operation in the northern Orel salient and achieved a breakthrough on the flank of the German 9th Army. Also worried by the Allies' landing in Sicily on 10 July, Hitler made the decision to halt the offensive even as the German 9th Army was rapidly giving ground in the north. The Germans' final strategic offensive in the Soviet Union ended with their defence against a major Soviet counteroffensive that lasted into August.\n\n\nThe Kursk offensive was the last on the scale of 1940 and 1941 that the *Wehrmacht* was able to launch; subsequent offensives would represent only a shadow of previous German offensive might.\n\n\n\n### Autumn and winter 1943\u201344[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** \"The Wannsee Protocol\". *Literature of the Holocaust*.

To the south, the Red Army broke through Army Group South's Belgorod positions and headed for Kharkov once again. Although intense battles of movement throughout late July and into August 1943 saw the Tigers blunting Soviet tank attacks on one axis, they were soon outflanked on another line to the west as the Soviet forces advanced down the Psel, and Kharkov was abandoned for the final time on 22 August.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Gellately, Robert (June 1996). \"Reviewed work(s): Vom Generalplan Ost zum Generalsiedlungsplan by Czeslaw Madajczyk; Der \"Generalplan Ost.\" Hauptlinien der nationalsozialistischen Planungs- und Vernichtungspolitik by Mechtild R\u00f6ssler and Sabine Schleiermacher\". *Central European History*. **29** (2): 270\u2013274. doi:10.1017/S0008938900013170.

However, access to (and control of) the resources, raw materials and production capacity required to entertain long-term goals (such as European control, German territorial expansion and the destruction of the USSR) were limited. Political demands necessitated the expansion of Germany's control of natural and human resources, industrial capacity and farmland beyond its borders (conquered territories). Germany's military production was tied to resources outside its area of control, a dynamic not found amongst the Allies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAside from the ideological conflict, the mindframe of the leaders of Germany and the Soviet Union, Hitler and Stalin, respectively, contributed to the escalation of terror and murder on an unprecedented scale. Stalin and Hitler both disregarded human life in order to achieve their goal of victory. This included the terrorisation of their own people, as well as mass deportations of entire populations. All these factors resulted in tremendous brutality both to combatants and civilians that found no parallel on the Western Front. According to *Time* magazine: \"By measure of manpower, duration, territorial reach and casualties, the Eastern Front was as much as four times the scale of the conflict on the Western Front that opened with the Normandy invasion.\"[113] Conversely, General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, calculated that without the Eastern Front, the United States would have had to double the number of its soldiers on the Western Front.[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* \"Operation Typhoon\": Video on YouTube, lecture by David Stahel, author of *Operation Typhoon.

During the Warsaw Uprising, the Red Army were ordered to halt at the Vistula River. Whether Stalin was unable or unwilling to come to the aid of the Polish resistance is disputed.[97]\n\n\nIn Slovakia, the Slovak National Uprising started as an armed struggle between German *Wehrmacht* forces and rebel Slovak troops between August and October 1944. It was centered at Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica.[98]\n\n\n\n### Autumn 1944[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Baltic Offensive (1944), Belgrade Offensive, and Budapest Offensive\n\nIn the Autumn of 1944, the Soviets paused their offensive towards Berlin to first gain control over the Balkans.\n\n\nOn 8 September 1944 the Red Army began an attack on the Dukla Pass on the Slovak\u2013Polish border. Two months later, the Soviet forces won the battle and entered Slovakia. The toll was high: 20,000 Red Army soldiers died, plus several thousand Germans, Slovaks and Czechs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo establish air supremacy, the *Luftwaffe* began immediate attacks on Soviet airfields, destroying much of the forward-deployed Soviet Air Force airfield fleets consisting of largely obsolescent types before their pilots had a chance to leave the ground.[68] For a month the offensive conducted on three axes was completely unstoppable as the panzer forces encircled hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops in huge pockets that were then reduced by slower-moving infantry armies while the panzers continued the offensive.\n\n\nArmy Group North's objective was Leningrad via the Baltic states. Comprising the 16th and 18th Armies and the 4th Panzer Group, this formation advanced through the Baltic states, and the Russian Pskov and Novgorod regions. Local insurgents seized the moment and controlled most of Lithuania, northern Latvia and southern Estonia prior to the arrival of the German forces.[69][70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSummary of Axis and Soviet tank and self-  \npropelled gun production during the war[138]\n| Year\n | Tanks and self-propelled guns\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Soviet\n | German\n | Italian\n | Hungarian\n | Romanian\n | Japanese\n |\n| 1941\n | 6,590\n | 5,200[140] | 595\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | 595\n |\n| 1942\n | 24,446\n | 9,300[140] | 1,252\n | 500\n | \u2013\n | 557\n |\n| 1943\n | 24,089\n | 19,800\n | 336\n | 105\n | 558\n |\n| 1944\n | 28,963\n | 27,300\n | \u2013\n | 353\n |\n| 1945[139] | 15,400\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | 137\n |\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Axis and Soviet aircraft production during the war[138]\n| Year\n | Aircraft\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Soviet\n | German\n | Italian\n | Hungarian\n | Romanian\n | Japanese\n |\n| 1941\n | 15,735\n | 11,776\n | 3,503\n | \u2013\n | 1,000\n | 5,088\n |\n| 1942\n | 25,436\n | 15,556\n | 2,818\n | 6\n | 8,861\n |\n| 1943\n | 34,845\n | 25,527\n | 967\n | 267\n | 16,693\n |\n| 1944\n | 40,246\n | 39,807\n | \u2013\n | 773\n | 28,180\n |\n| 1945[139] | 20,052\n | 7,544\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | 8,263\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)German soldiers in a Panzer III tank; Kalmyk steppe north of Stalingrad, September 1942\nBy July 1943, the Wehrmacht numbered 6,815,000 troops. Of these, 3,900,000 were deployed in eastern Europe, 180,000 in Finland, 315,000 in Norway, 110,000 in Denmark, 1,370,000 in western Europe, 330,000 in Italy, and 610,000 in the Balkans.[41] According to a presentation by Alfred Jodl, the Wehrmacht was up to 7,849,000 personnel in April 1944. 3,878,000 were deployed in eastern Europe, 311,000 in Norway/Denmark, 1,873,000 in western Europe, 961,000 in Italy, and 826,000 in the Balkans.[42] About 15\u201320% of total German strength were foreign troops (from allied countries or conquered territories). The German high water mark was just before the Battle of Kursk, in early July 1943: 3,403,000 German troops and 650,000 Finnish, Hungarian, Romanian and other countries' troops.[34][35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe offensive to capture central Germany and Berlin started on 16 April with an assault on the German front lines on the Oder and Neisse rivers. After several days of heavy fighting the Soviet 1BF and 1UF punched holes through the German front line and were fanning out across central Germany. By 24 April, elements of the 1BF and 1UF had completed the encirclement of the German capital and the Battle of Berlin entered its final stages. On 25 April the 2BF broke through the German 3rd Panzer Army's line south of Stettin. They were now free to move west towards the British 21st Army Group and north towards the Baltic port of Stralsund. The 58th Guards Rifle Division of the 5th Guards Army made contact with the US 69th Infantry Division of the First Army near Torgau, Germany at the Elbe river.[102][103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Axis forces, led by Nazi Germany, began their advance into the Soviet Union under the codename Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, the opening date of the Eastern Front. Initially, Soviet forces were unable to halt the Axis forces, which came close to Moscow. Despite their many attempts, the Axis failed to capture Moscow and soon focused on the oil fields in the Caucasus. German forces invaded the Caucasus under *Fall Blau* (\"Case Blue\") on 28 June 1942. The Soviets successfully halting further Axis advance at Stalingrad \u2014 the bloodiest battle in the war \u2014 lost the Axis powers their morale and became the turning point of the front.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1 May 1944 | 2,460,000 Germans, 60,000 (northern Norway); 300,000 Finns, 550,000 Romanians and HungariansTotal: **3,370,000** in the east (62% of the German Army) | **6,425,000** |\n| 1 January 1945 | 2,230,000 Germans, 100,000 HungariansTotal: **2,330,000** in the east (60% of the German Army) | **6,532,000** (360,000 Poles, Romanians, Bulgarians, and Czechs)\n |\n| 1 April 1945 | 1,960,000 GermansTotal: **1,960,000** (66% of the German Army) | **6,410,000** (450,000 Poles, Romanians, Bulgarians, and Czechs)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne final move in the south completed the 1943\u201344 campaigning season, which had wrapped up a Soviet advance of over 800 kilometres (500\u00a0mi). In March, 20 German divisions of *Generaloberst* Hans-Valentin Hube's 1st Panzer Army were encircled in what was to be known as Hube's Pocket near Kamenets-Podolskiy. After two weeks' of heavy fighting, the 1st Panzer managed to escape the pocket, at the cost of losing almost the entire heavy equipment. At this point, Hitler sacked several prominent generals, Manstein included. In April, the Red Army took back Odessa, followed by 4th Ukrainian Front's campaign to restore control over the Crimea, which culminated in the capture of Sevastopol on 10 May.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n82. **^** Deighton, Len (1993). *Blood, Tears and Folly*.

As tension heightened in spring, 1941, Stalin desperately tried not to give Hitler any provocation that Berlin could use as an excuse for a German attack; Stalin refused to allow the military to go on the alert \u2013 even as German troops gathered on the borders and German reconnaissance planes overflew installations. This refusal to take necessary action was instrumental in the destruction of major portions of the Red Air Force, lined up on its airfields, in the first days of the German\u2013Soviet war.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Soviet and Polish Armia Krajowa soldiers in Vilnius, July 1944\n*Wehrmacht* planners were convinced that the Red Army would attack again in the south, where the front was 80 kilometres (50\u00a0mi) from Lviv and offered the most direct route to Berlin. Accordingly, they stripped troops from Army Group Centre, whose front still protruded deep into the Soviet Union. The Germans had transferred some units to France to counter the invasion of Normandy two weeks before. The Belorussian Offensive (codenamed Operation Bagration), which was agreed upon by Allies at the Tehran Conference in December 1943 and launched on 22 June 1944, was a massive Soviet attack, consisting of four Soviet army groups totalling over 120 divisions that smashed into a thinly held German line.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe enormous territorial gains of 1941 presented Germany with vast areas to pacify and administer. For the majority of people of the Soviet Union, the Nazi invasion was viewed as a brutal act of unprovoked aggression. While it is important to note that not all parts of Soviet society viewed the German advance in this way, the majority of the Soviet population viewed German forces as occupiers. In areas such as Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania (which had been annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940) the *Wehrmacht* was tolerated by a relatively more significant part of the native population.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n153. **^** R\u00fcdiger Overmans, *Deutsche milit\u00e4rische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg*.

Because of Stalin's suspicions about the intentions of the Western Allies to hand over territory occupied by them in the post-war Soviet sphere of influence, the offensive was to be on a broad front and was to move as rapidly as possible to the west, to meet the Western Allies as far west as possible. But the over-riding objective was to capture Berlin. The two were complementary because possession of the zone could not be won quickly unless Berlin was taken. Another consideration was that Berlin itself held strategic assets, including Adolf Hitler and part of the German atomic bomb program.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe states that provided forces and other resources for the German war effort included the Axis Powers \u2013 primarily Romania, Hungary, Italy, pro-Nazi Slovakia, and Croatia. Anti-Soviet Finland, which had fought the Winter War against the Soviet Union, also joined the offensive. The *Wehrmacht* forces were also assisted by anti-Communist partisans in places like Western Ukraine, and the Baltic states.

Debate among the General Staff was polarised, with even Hitler nervous about any attempt to pinch off the Kursk salient. He knew that in the intervening six months the Soviet position at Kursk had been reinforced heavily with anti-tank guns, tank traps, landmines, barbed wire, trenches, pillboxes, artillery and mortars.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Edwards, Robert (15 August 2018). *The Eastern Front: The Germans and Soviets at War in World War II*.

The Nazi vision for the future of Eastern Europe was codified most clearly in the *Generalplan Ost*. The populations of occupied Central Europe and the Soviet Union were to be partially deported to West Siberia, enslaved and eventually exterminated; the conquered territories were to be colonised by German or \"Germanized\" settlers.[16] In addition, the Nazis also sought to wipe out the large Jewish population of Central and Eastern Europe[17]\nas part of their program aiming to exterminate all European Jews.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMemorandum for the President's Special Assistant Harry Hopkins, Washington, D.C., 10 August 1943:\n\n\n\n\n> In War II Russia occupies a dominant position and is the decisive factor looking toward the defeat of the Axis in Europe. While in Sicily the forces of Great Britain and the United States are being opposed by 2 German divisions, the Russian front is receiving attention of approximately 200 German divisions. Whenever the Allies open a second front on the Continent, it will be decidedly a secondary front to that of Russia; theirs will continue to be the main effort. Without Russia in the war, the Axis cannot be defeated in Europe, and the position of the United Nations becomes precarious. Similarly, Russia's post-war position in Europe will be a dominant one. With Germany crushed, there is no power in Europe to oppose her tremendous military forces.[115]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Soviets also lost 102,600 aircraft (combat and non-combat causes), including 46,100 in combat.[165] According to Soviet claims, the Germans lost 75,700 aircraft on the Eastern front.[166]\n\n\nPolish Armed Forces in the East, initially consisting of Poles from Eastern Poland or otherwise in the Soviet Union in 1939\u20131941, began fighting alongside the Red Army in 1943, and grew steadily as more Polish territory was liberated from the Nazis in 1944\u20131945.\n\n\n\n![](image)Dead Soviet soldiers in Kholm, January 1942\nWhen the Axis countries of Central Europe were occupied by the Soviets, they changed sides and declared war on Germany (see Allied Commissions).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nas well as the reluctance of the British and French governments to sign a full-scale anti-German political and military alliance with the USSR,[30] led to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Germany in late August 1939.[31] The separate Tripartite Pact between what became the three prime Axis Powers would not be signed until some four years after the Anti-Comintern Pact.\n\n\n\n## Forces[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Aufbau Ost (1940) and Lossberg study\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Lubbeck, William and David B.

Much of the combat took place in or close to populated areas, and the actions of both sides contributed to massive loss of civilian life and tremendous material damage. According to a summary, presented by Lieutenant General Roman Rudenko at the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, the property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the Axis invasion was estimated to a value of 679\u00a0billion rubles. The largest number of civilian deaths in a single city was 1.2\u00a0million citizens dead during the Siege of Leningrad.[117]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe advance into the Caucasus bogged down, with the Germans unable to fight their way past Malgobek and to the main prize of Grozny. Instead, they switched the direction of their advance to approach it from the south, crossing the Malka at the end of October and entering North Ossetia and entered the suburbs of Ordzhonikidze on 2 November.\n\n\n\n### Stalingrad: Winter 1942[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Battle of Stalingrad, Operation Little Saturn, Operation Mars, Third Battle of Kharkov, and Battle for Velikiye Luki (1943)\n\n![](image)Soviet advances on the Eastern Front, 18 November 1942 to March 1943: to 12 December 1942\n to 18 February 1943\n to March 1943 (Soviet gains only)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n119. **^** Glantz 2005, p.\u00a0181.\n120. **^** Toppe, Alfred (1998), *Night Combat*, Diane, p.\u00a028, ISBN\u00a0978-0-7881-7080-5\n121. **^** Roberts, Geoffrey (2006). *Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939\u20131953*.

Further north still, the Soviet 2nd Shock Army was unleashed on the Volkhov River. Initially this made some progress; however, it was unsupported, and by June a German counterattack cut off and destroyed the army. The Soviet commander, Lieutenant General Andrey Vlasov, later defected to Germany and formed the ROA or Russian Liberation Army. In the south the Red Army lunged over the Donets River at Izyum and drove a 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) deep salient. The intent was to pin Army Group South against the Sea of Azov, but as the winter eased the Wehrmacht counter-attacked and cut off the over-extended Soviet troops in the Second Battle of Kharkov.\n\n\n\n### Don, Volga, and Caucasus: Summer 1942[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 1940 the Soviet Union occupied and illegally annexed the three Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania).[8] The Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact ostensibly provided security to the Soviets in the occupation both of the Baltics and of the north and northeastern regions of Romania (Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia, June\u2013July 1940), although Hitler, in announcing the invasion of the Soviet Union, cited the Soviet annexations of Baltic and Romanian territory as having violated Germany's understanding of the pact. Moscow partitioned the annexed Romanian territory between the Ukrainian and Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republics.\n\n\n\n## Ideologies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Germany\u2013Soviet Union relations, 1918\u20131941\n\n### German ideology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mein Kampf, Racial policy of Nazi Germany, and Nazism and race\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon learning of Hitler and Goebbels's death, D\u00f6nitz (now President of the Reich) appointed Johann Ludwig Schwerin von Krosigk as new \"Leading Minister\" of the German Reich.[106] Rapidly advancing Allied forces limited the jurisdiction of the new German government to an area around Flensburg near the Danish border, where D\u00f6nitz's headquarters were located, along with M\u00fcrwik. Accordingly, this administration was referred to as the Flensburg government.[107] D\u00f6nitz and Schwerin von Krosigk attempted to negotiate an armistice with the Western Allies while continuing to resist the Soviet Army, but were eventually forced to accept an unconditional surrender on all fronts.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the war, as Germany acquired new territories (either by direct annexation or by installing puppet governments in defeated countries), these new territories were forced to sell raw materials and agricultural products to German buyers at extremely low prices. Overall, France made the largest contribution to the German war effort. Two-thirds of all French trains in 1941 were used to carry goods to Germany. In 1943\u201344, French payments to Germany may have risen to as much as 55% of French GDP.[53] Norway lost 20% of its national income in 1940 and 40% in 1943.[54] Axis allies such as Romania and Italy, Hungary, Finland, Croatia and Bulgaria benefited from Germany's net imports. Overall, Germany imported 20% of its food and 33% of its raw materials from conquered territories and Axis allies.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to a report prepared by the General Staff of the Army issued in December 1944, materiel losses in the East from the period of 22 June 1941 until November 1944 stood at 33,324 armoured vehicles of all types (tanks, assault guns, tank destroyers, self-propelled guns and others). Paul Winter, *Defeating Hitler*, states \"these figures are undoubtedly too low\".[161] According to Soviet claims, the Germans lost 42,700 tanks, tank destroyers, self-propelled guns and assault guns on the Eastern front.[162] Overall, Germany produced 3,024 reconnaissance vehicles,[*unreliable source?*] 2,450 other armoured vehicles, 21,880 armoured personnel carriers, 36,703 semi-tracked tractors and 87,329 semi-tracked trucks,[163] estimated 2/3 were lost on the Eastern Front.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Soviets lost 96,500 tanks, tank destroyers, self-propelled guns and assault guns, as well as 37,600 other armoured vehicles (such as armoured cars and semi-tracked trucks) for a total of 134,100 armoured vehicles lost.[164]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe war inflicted huge losses and suffering upon the civilian populations of the affected countries. Behind the front lines, atrocities against civilians in German-occupied areas were routine, including those carried out as part of the Holocaust. German and German-allied forces treated civilian populations with exceptional brutality, massacring whole village populations and routinely killing civilian hostages (see German war crimes). Both sides practised widespread scorched earth tactics, but the loss of civilian lives in the case of Germany was incomparably smaller than that of the Soviet Union, in which at least 20\u00a0million were killed. According to British historian Geoffrey Hosking, \"The full demographic loss to the Soviet peoples was even greater: since a high proportion of those killed were young men of child-begetting age, the postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than post-1939 projections would have led one to expect.\"[116]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Zhukov, Georgy (1972). *Vospominaniya i razmyshleniya*.

Officers with initiative were replaced with yes-men or with fanatical Nazis. The disastrous encirclements later in the war \u2013 at Stalingrad, Korsun and many other places \u2013 resulted directly from Hitler's orders. This idea of holding territory led to another failed plan, dubbed[*by whom?*] \"*Heaven-bound Missions*\", which involved fortifying even the most unimportant or insignificant of cities and the holding of these \"fortresses\" at all costs. Many divisions became cut off in \"fortress\" cities, or wasted uselessly in secondary theatres, because Hitler would not sanction retreat or voluntarily abandon any of his conquests.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNaval vessels alone constituted 10\u201315% of Germany's war expenditures from 1940 to 1944 depending on the year, while armoured vehicles by comparison were only 5\u20138%.[137]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter the German defeat, Stalin promised his allies Truman and Churchill that he would attack the Japanese within 90 days of the German surrender. The Soviet invasion of Manchuria began on 8 August 1945, with an assault on the Japanese puppet states of Manchukuo and neighbouring Mengjiang; the greater offensive would eventually include northern Korea, southern Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands. Apart from the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, it marked the only military action of the Soviet Union against Imperial Japan; at the Yalta Conference, it had agreed to Allied pleas to terminate the neutrality pact with Japan and enter the Second World War's Pacific theatre within three months after the end of the war in Europe. While not a part of the Eastern Front operations, it is included here because the commanders and much of the forces used by the Red Army came from the European Theatre of operations and benefited from the experience gained there.[111]\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The Italian front is considered a separate but related theatre.[nb 12] The Western Front's 1944\u20131945 phase was officially deemed the European Theater by the United States, whereas Italy fell under the Mediterranean Theater along with North Africa. The Western Front was marked by two phases of large-scale combat operations. The first phase saw the capitulation of Luxembourg, Netherlands, Belgium, and France during May and June 1940 after their defeat in the Low Countries and the northern half of France, and continued into an air war between Germany and Britain that climaxed with the Battle of Britain. The second phase consisted of large-scale ground combat (supported by a massive strategic air war considered to be an additional front), which began in June 1944 with the Allied landings in Normandy and continued until the defeat of Germany in May 1945 with its invasion.\n\n\n\n\n## 1939\u20131940: Axis victories[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 September 1939, World War II began with the German invasion of Poland. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September. The next few months in the war were marked by the Phoney War.\n\n\n\n### Phoney War[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Phoney War\n\nThe Phoney War was an early phase of World War II marked by a few military operations in Continental Europe in the months following the German invasion of Poland and preceding the Battle of France. Although the great powers of Europe had declared war on one another, neither side had yet committed to launching a significant attack, and there was relatively little fighting on the ground. This was also the period in which the United Kingdom and France did not supply significant aid to Poland, despite their pledged alliance.\n\n\nThe French forces launched a small offensive, the Saar Offensive against Germany in the Saar region but halted their advance and returned. While most of the German Army was fighting against Poland, a much smaller German force manned the Siegfried Line, their fortified defensive line along the French border. At the Maginot Line on the other side of the border, French troops stood facing them, whilst the British Expeditionary Force and other elements of the French Army created a defensive line along the Belgian border. There were only some local, minor skirmishes. The British Royal Air Force dropped propaganda leaflets on Germany and the first Canadian troops stepped ashore in Britain, while Western Europe was in a strange calm for seven months.\n\n\nIn their hurry to re-arm, Britain and France had both begun to buy large numbers of weapons from manufacturers in the United States at the outbreak of hostilities, supplementing their own production. The non-belligerent United States contributed to the Western Allies by discounted sales of military equipment and supplies. German efforts to interdict the Allies' trans-Atlantic trade at sea ignited the Battle of the Atlantic.\n\n\n\n### Operation Weser\u00fcbung[edit]\n\n\nWhile the Western Front remained quiet in April 1940, the fighting between the Allies and the Germans began in earnest with the Norwegian Campaign when the Germans launched Operation Weser\u00fcbung, the German invasion of Denmark and Norway. In doing so, the Germans beat the Allies to the punch; the Allies had been planning an amphibious landing in which they could begin to surround Germany, cutting off her supply of raw materials from Sweden. However, when the Allies made a counter-landing in Norway following the German invasion, the Germans repulsed them and defeated the Norwegian armed forces, driving the latter into exile. The *Kriegsmarine*, nonetheless, suffered very heavy losses during the two months of fighting required to seize all of mainland Norway.\n\n\n\n### Battles for Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and France[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German invasion of Luxembourg, Battle of the Netherlands, Battle of Belgium, and Battle of France\n\nIn May 1940, the Germans launched the Battle of France. The Western Allies (primarily the French, Belgian and British land forces) soon collapsed under the onslaught of the so-called \"*blitzkrieg*\" strategy. Following the German breakthrough at Sedan, the BEF, along with the best of the French and Belgian armies became trapped in Flanders. With the use of paratroopers and concentrated firepower, the Belgian and Dutch armies surrendered after several days. Luxembourg fell within the first day. \n\n\nThe majority of the British and elements of the French forces escaped at Dunkirk. This was due to the combined factors of poor weather, Germans mishaps, and the incredible number of British civilian ships assembled for the undertaking. Following the conclusion of events at Dunkirk on June 4, the Wehrmacht commenced Fall Rot, an offensive against the remaining French armies. With most of the French armies either destroyed or taken prisoner, the Germans quickly broke through the French lines, taking Paris on June 14. As France was falling, the British began the strategic withdrawal of all remaining British troops from France, via French ports still under Allied control. \n\n\nWith the war all but decided, Italy also declared war on the UK and France, but made little progress. With the situation becoming dire, French Prime Minister Philippe P\u00e9tain signed the Second Armistice of Compi\u00e8gne on June 22, 1940, with its terms taking effect on the 25th of June. The terms of the armistice called for the occupation of Northern France, along with the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine into the German Reich. Italy also was allowed a small occupation zone in the southeast. France was allowed to continue its existence in the form of Vichy France, a rump state of the former French Republic, led by Philippe P\u00e9tain. the Vichy regime was allowed to keep their colonial empire and navy fleet, as some of Hitler's few concessions. \n\n\nIn six weeks of fighting, the combined allied armies suffered more than 375,000 killed or wounded, as well as 1,800,000 soldiers becoming prisoners of war. Meanwhile, Germany suffered a more modest 43,110 killed and 111,000 wounded. Hitler had expected a million men to die in the conquest of France. Remarkedly low casualties and France's quick defeat led to a massive rise in morale among the German people. With the fighting ended, the Germans began to consider ways of resolving the question of how to deal with Britain. If the British refused to agree to a peace treaty, one option was to invade. However, Nazi Germany's *Kriegsmarine*, had suffered serious losses in Norway, and in order to even consider an amphibious landing, Germany's Air Force (the Luftwaffe) had to first gain air superiority or air supremacy.\n\n\n\n## 1941\u20131944: Interlude[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Commando raids on the Atlantic Wall and Defence of the Reich\n\nWith the Luftwaffe unable to defeat the RAF in the Battle of Britain, the invasion of Great Britain could no longer be thought of as an option. While the majority of the German army was mustered for the invasion of the Soviet Union, construction began on the Atlantic Wall \u2013 a series of defensive fortifications along the French coast of the English Channel. These were built in anticipation of an Allied invasion of France.\n\n\n\n![](image)Dieppe's pebble beach and cliff immediately following the raid on 19 August 1942. A scout car has been abandoned.\nBecause of the massive logistical obstacles a cross-channel invasion would face, the Allied high command decided to conduct a practice attack against the French coast. On 19 August 1942, the Allies began the Dieppe Raid, an attack on Dieppe, France. Most of the troops were Canadian, with some British contingents and a small American and Free French presence along with British and Polish naval support. The raid was a disaster, almost two-thirds of the attacking force became casualties. However, much was learned as a result of the operation \u2013 these lessons would be put to good use in the subsequent invasion.\n\n\nFor almost two years, there was no land-fighting on the Western Front with the exception of commando raids and the guerrilla actions of the resistance aided by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and Office of Strategic Services (OSS). However, in the meantime, the Allies took the war to Germany, with a strategic bombing campaign the US Eighth Air Force bombing Germany by day and RAF Bomber Command bombing by night. The bulk of the Allied armies were occupied in the Mediterranean, seeking to clear the sea lanes to the Indian Ocean and capture the Foggia Airfield Complex.\n\n\nTwo early British raids for which battle honours were awarded were Operation Collar in Boulogne (24 June 1940) and Operation Ambassador in Guernsey (14\u201315 July 1940). The raids for which the British awarded the \"North-West Europe Campaign of 1942\" battle honour were: Operation Biting \u2013 Bruneval (27\u201328 February 1942), St Nazaire (27\u201328 March 1942), Operation Myrmidon \u2013 Bayonne (5 April 1942), Operation Abercrombie \u2013 Hardelot (21\u201322 April 1942), Dieppe (19 August 1942) and Operation Frankton \u2013 Gironde (7\u201312 December 1942).[30][31]\n\n\nA raid on Sark on the night of 3/4 October 1942 is notable because a few days after the incursion the Germans issued a propaganda communiqu\u00e9 implying at least one prisoner had escaped and two were shot while resisting having their hands tied. This instance of tying prisoner's hands contributed to Hitler's decision to issue his Commando Order instructing that all captured Commandos or Commando-type personnel were to be executed as a matter of procedure.\n\n\n\n![](image)Field Marshal Erwin Rommel visiting the Atlantic Wall defences near the Belgian port of Ostend\nBy the summer of 1944, when an expectation of an Allied invasion was freely admitted by German commanders, the disposition of troops facing it came under the command of OB West (HQ in Paris). In turn, it commanded three groups: the Wehrmacht Netherlands Command (*Wehrmachtbefehlshaber Niederlande*) or WBN, covering the Dutch and Belgian coasts and Army Group B, covering the coast of northern France with the German 15th Army (HQ in Tourcoing), in the area north of the Seine; the 7th Army, (HQ in Le Mans), between the Seine and the Loire defending the English Channel and the Atlantic coast, and Army Group G with responsibility for the Bay of Biscay coast and Vichy France, with its 1st Army, (HQ in Bordeaux), responsible for the Atlantic coast between the Loire and the Spanish border and the 19th Army, (HQ in Avignon), responsible for the Mediterranean coast.\n\n\nIt was not possible to predict where the Allies might choose to launch their invasion. The chance of an amphibious landing necessitated the substantial dispersal of the German mobile reserves, which contained the majority of their panzer troops. Each army group was allocated its mobile reserves. Army Group\u00a0B had the 2nd Panzer Division in northern France, 116th Panzer Division in the Paris area, and the 21st Panzer Division in Normandy. Army Group\u00a0G, considering the possibility of an invasion on the Atlantic coast, had dispersed its mobile reserves, locating the 11th Panzer Division in Gironde, the 2nd SS Panzer Division *Das Reich* refitting around the southern French town of Montauban, and the 9th Panzer Division stationed in the Rhone delta area.\n\n\nThe OKW retained a substantial reserve of such mobile divisions also, but these were dispersed over a large area: the 1st SS Panzer Division *Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler* was still Netherlands, the 12th SS Panzer Division *Hitlerjugend* and the *Panzer-Lehr* Division were located in the Paris\u2013Orleans area, since the Normandy coastal defence sectors or (*K\u00fcstenverteitigungsabschnitte* \u2013 KVA) were considered the most likely areas for an invasion. The 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division *G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen* was located just south of the Loire in the vicinity of Tours.\n\n\n\n## 1944\u20131945: The Second Front[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Western Front command tenures (World War II)\n\n### Allied landing in Normandy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Operation Overlord\n\n![](image)Routes taken by the D-Day invasion\nOn 6 June 1944, the Allies began Operation Overlord (also known as \"D-Day\") \u2013 the long-awaited liberation of France. The deception plans, Operation Fortitude and Operation Bodyguard, had the Germans convinced that the invasion would occur in the Pas-de-Calais, while the real target was Normandy. Following two months of slow fighting in hedgerow country, Operation Cobra allowed the Americans to break out at the western end of the lodgement. Soon after, the Allies were racing across France. They encircled around 200,000 Germans in the Falaise Pocket. As had so often happened on the Eastern Front Hitler refused to allow a strategic withdrawal until it was too late. Approximately 150,000 Germans were able to escape from the Falaise pocket, but they left behind most of their irreplaceable equipment and 50,000 Germans were killed or taken prisoner.\n\n\nThe Allies had been arguing about whether to advance on a broad-front or a narrow-front from before D-Day.[32] If the British had broken out of the Normandy bridgehead (or beachhead) around Caen when they launched Operation Goodwood and pushed along the coast, facts on the ground might have turned the argument in favour of a narrow front. However, as the breakout took place during Operation Cobra at the western end of the bridge-head, the 21st Army Group that included the British and Canadian forces swung east and headed for Belgium, the Netherlands and Northern Germany, while the U.S. Twelfth Army Group advanced to their south via eastern France, Luxembourg and the Ruhr Area, rapidly fanning out into a broad front. As this was the strategy favoured by the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, and most of the American high command, it was soon adopted.\n\n\n\n### Liberation of France[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The US Seventh Army and the French First Army, making up the US 6th Army Group, rapidly consolidated this beachhead and liberated Southern France in two weeks; they then moved north up the Rhone valley. Their advance only slowed down as they encountered regrouped and entrenched German troops in the Vosges Mountains.\n\n\nThe Germans in France were now faced by three powerful Allied army groups: in the north the British 21st Army Group commanded by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, in the center the American 12th Army Group, commanded by General Omar Bradley and to the south the US 6th Army Group commanded by Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers. By mid-September, the 6th Army Group, advancing from the south, came into contact with Bradley's formations advancing from the west and overall control of Devers' force passed from AFHQ in the Mediterranean so that all three army groups came under Eisenhower's central command at SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Forces).\n\n\nUnder the onslaught in both the north and south of France, the German Army fell back. On 19 August, the French Resistance (FFI) organised a general uprising and the liberation of Paris took place on 25 August when general Dietrich von Choltitz accepted the French ultimatum and surrendered to general Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, commander of the Free French 2nd Armored Division, ignoring orders from Hitler that Paris should be held to the last and destroyed.\n\n\nThe liberation of Northern France and the Benelux countries was of special significance for the inhabitants of London and the southeast of England because it denied the Germans launch sites for their mobile V-1 and V-2 *Vergeltungswaffen* (reprisal weapons).\n\n\nAs the Allies advanced across France, their supply lines stretched to breaking point. The Red Ball Express, the Allied trucking effort, was simply unable to transport enough supplies from the port facilities in Normandy all the way to the front line, which by September, was close to the German border.\n\n\nMajor German units in the French southwest that had not been committed in Normandy withdrew, either eastwards towards Alsace (sometimes directly across the US 6th Army Group's advance) or into the ports with the intention of denying them to the Allies. These latter groups were not thought worth much effort and were left \"to rot\", with the exception of Bordeaux, which was liberated in May 1945 by French forces under General Edgard de Larminat (Operation Venerable).[33]\n\n\n\n### Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Starting in early September, the Americans began slow and bloody fighting through the Hurtgen Forest (\"*Passchendaele with tree bursts*\"\u2014Hemingway) to breach the Line.\n\n\nThe port of Antwerp was liberated on 4 September by the British 11th Armoured Division.\nHowever, it lay at the end of the long Scheldt Estuary, and so it could not be used until its approaches were clear of heavily fortified German positions. The Breskens pocket on the southern bank of the Scheldt was cleared with heavy casualties by allied forces in Operation Switchback, during the Battle of the Scheldt. This was followed by a tedious campaign to clear a peninsula dominating the estuary, and finally, the amphibious assault on Walcheren Island in November. The campaign to clear the Scheldt Estuary along with Operation Pheasant was a decisive victory for the Allies, as it allowed a greatly improved delivery of supplies directly from Antwerp, which was far closer to the front than the Normandy beaches.\n\n\nIn October the Americans decided that they could not just invest Aachen and let it fall in a slow siege, because it threatened the flanks of the U.S. Ninth Army. As it was the first major German city to face capture, Hitler ordered that the city be held at all costs. In the resulting battle, the city was taken, at a cost of 5,000 casualties on both sides, with an additional 5,600 German prisoners.\n\n\nSouth of the Ardennes, American forces fought from September until mid-December to push the Germans out of Lorraine and from behind the Siegfried Line. The crossing of the Moselle River and the capture of the fortress of Metz proved difficult for the American troops in the face of German reinforcements, supply shortages, and unfavorable weather. During September and October, the Allied 6th Army Group (U.S. Seventh Army and French First Army) fought a difficult campaign through the Vosges Mountains that was marked by dogged German resistance and slow advances. In November, however, the German front snapped under the pressure, resulting in sudden Allied advances that liberated Belfort, Mulhouse, and Strasbourg, and placed Allied forces along the Rhine River. The Germans managed to hold a large bridgehead (the Colmar Pocket), on the western bank of the Rhine and centered around the city of Colmar. On 16 November the Allies started a large scale autumn offensive called Operation Queen. With its main thrust again through the H\u00fcrtgen Forest, the offensive drove the Allies to the Rur River, but failed in its core objectives to capture the Rur dams and pave the way towards the Rhine. The Allied operations were then succeeded by the German Ardennes offensive.\n\n\n\n### Operation Market Garden[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, commanding the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, persuaded the Allied High Command to launch a bold attack, Operation Market Garden, which he hoped would get the Allies across the Rhine and create the narrow-front he favoured. Airborne troops would fly in from the United Kingdom and take bridges over the main rivers of the German-occupied Netherlands in three main cities; Eindhoven, Nijmegen, and Arnhem. The British XXX Corps would punch through the German lines along the Maas\u2013Schelde canal and link up with the airborne troops of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division in Eindhoven, the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division at Nijmegen and the British 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem. If all went well XXX Corps would advance into Germany without any remaining major obstacles. XXX Corps was able to advance beyond six of the seven airborne-held bridges but was unable to link up with the troops near the bridge over the Rhine at Arnhem. \n\n\nThe result was the near-destruction of the British 1st Airborne Division during the Battle of Arnhem, which sustained almost 8,000 casualties. The offensive ended with Arnhem remaining in German hands and the Allies holding an extended salient from the Belgian border to the area between Nijmegen and Arnhem. A German attempt to recapture the salient ended in failure in early October.\n\n\n\n### Winter counter-offensives[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The plan called *Wacht am Rhein (\"Watch on the Rhine\")* was to attack through the Ardennes and swing north to Antwerp, splitting the American and British armies. The attack started on 16 December in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. Defending the Ardennes were troops of the US First Army. Initial successes in bad weather, which gave them cover from the Allied air forces, resulted in a German penetration of over 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) to within less than 16\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) of the Meuse. Having been taken by surprise, the Allies regrouped and the Germans were stopped by a combined air and land counter-attack which eventually pushed them back to their starting points by 25 January 1945.\n\n\nThe Germans launched a second, smaller offensive (*Nordwind*) into Alsace on 1 January 1945. Aiming to recapture Strasbourg, the Germans attacked the 6th Army Group at multiple points. Because the Allied lines had become severely stretched in response to the crisis in the Ardennes, holding and throwing back the *Nordwind* offensive was a costly affair that lasted almost four weeks. The culmination of Allied counter-attacks restored the front line to the area of the German border and collapsed the Colmar Pocket.\n\n\n\n### Invasion of Germany[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Western Allied invasion of Germany\n\nIn January 1945 the German bridgehead over the river Roer between Heinsberg and Roermond was cleared during Operation Blackcock. This was followed by a pincer movement of the First Canadian Army in Operation Veritable advancing from the Nijmegen area of the Netherlands, and the US Ninth Army crossing the Roer in Operation Grenade. Veritable and Grenade were planned to start on 8 February 1945, but Grenade was delayed by two weeks when the Germans flooded the Roer valley by destroying the gates of the Rur Dam upstream. Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt requested permission to withdraw east behind the Rhine, arguing that further resistance would only delay the inevitable, but was ordered by Hitler to fight where his forces stood.\n\n\nBy the time the water had subsided and the US Ninth Army was able to cross the Roer on 23 February, other Allied forces were also close to the Rhine's west bank. Von Rundstedt's divisions, which had remained on the west bank, were cut to pieces in the ''battle of the Rhineland' \u2013 280,000 men were taken prisoner. With a large number of men captured, the stubborn German resistance during the Allied campaign to reach the Rhine in February and March 1945 had been costly. Total losses reached an estimated 400,000 men.[34] By the time they prepared to cross the Rhine in late March, the Western Allies had taken 1,300,000 German soldiers prisoner in western Europe.[nb 13]\n\n\n\n![](image)US soldiers cross the Rhine river in assault boats.\nThe crossing of the Rhine was achieved at four points:\n\n\n\n* One was an opportunity taken by US forces when the Germans failed to blow up the Ludendorff bridge at Remagen, one crossing was a hasty assault, and two crossings were planned. Bradley and his subordinates quickly exploited the Remagen crossing made on 7 March and expanded the bridgehead into a full-scale crossing.\n* Bradley told General Patton whose U.S. Third Army had been fighting through the Palatinate, to \"take the Rhine on the run\".[35] The Third Army did just that on the night of 22 March, crossing the river with a hasty assault south of Mainz at Oppenheim.\n* In the North Operation Plunder was the name given to the assault crossing of the Rhine at Rees and Wesel by the British 21st Army Group on the night of 23 March. It included the largest airborne operation in history, which was codenamed Operation Varsity. At the point the British crossed the river, it is twice as wide, with a far higher volume of water, as the points where the Americans crossed and Montgomery decided it could only be crossed with a carefully planned operation.[*citation needed*]\n* In the Allied 6th Army Group area, the US Seventh Army assaulted across the Rhine in the area between Mannheim and Worms on 26 March.[36] A fifth crossing on a much smaller scale was later achieved by the French First Army at Speyer.[37]\n\n\nOnce the Allies had crossed the Rhine, the British fanned out northeast towards Hamburg crossing the river Elbe and on towards Denmark and the Baltic. British forces captured Bremen on 26 April after a week of combat.[38] British and Canadian paratroopers reached the Baltic city of Wismar just ahead of Soviet forces on 2 May. The US Ninth Army, which had remained under British command since the battle of the Bulge, went south as the northern pincer of the Ruhr encirclement as well as pushing elements east. XIX Corps of the Ninth Army captured Magdeburg on 18 April and the US XIII Corps to the north occupied Stendal.[39]\n\n\nThe US 12th Army Group fanned out, and the First Army went north as the southern pincer of the Ruhr encirclement. On 4 April the encirclement was completed and the Ninth Army reverted to the command of Bradley's 12th Army Group. The German Army Group B commanded by Field Marshal Walther Model was trapped in the Ruhr Pocket and 300,000 soldiers became POWs. The Ninth and First American armies then turned east and pushed to the Elbe river by mid-April. During the push east, the cities of Frankfurt am Main, Kassel, Magdeburg, Halle and Leipzig were strongly defended by ad hoc German garrisons made up of regular troops, Flak units, Volkssturm and armed Nazi Party auxiliaries. Generals Eisenhower and Bradley concluded that pushing beyond the Elbe made no sense since eastern Germany was destined in any case to be occupied by the Red Army. The First and Ninth Armies stopped along the Elbe and Mulde rivers, making contact with Soviet forces near the Elbe in late April. The US Third Army had fanned out to the east into western Czechoslovakia and southeast into eastern Bavaria and northern Austria. By V-E Day, the US 12th Army Group was a force of four armies (First, Third, Ninth and Fifteenth) that numbered over 1.3\u00a0million men.[40]\n\n\n\n### Final moves by Western Allies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Race to Berlin\n\nGeneral Eisenhower's Armies were facing resistance that varied from almost non-existent to fanatical[41] as they advanced toward Berlin, which was located 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) from their positions in early April 1945. Britain's Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, urged Eisenhower to continue the advance toward Berlin by the 21st Army Group, under the command of Montgomery with the intention of capturing the city. Even Patton agreed with Churchill that he should order the attack on the city since Montgomery's troops could reach Berlin within three days.[42] The British and Americans contemplated an airborne operation before the attack. In Operation Eclipse, the 17th Airborne Division, 82d Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division, and a British brigade were to seize the Tempelhof, Rangsdorf, Gatow, Staaken, and Oranienburg airfields. In Berlin, the Reichsbanner resistance organization identified possible drop zones for Allied paratroopers and planned to guide them past German defenses into the city.[43]\n\n\nAfter Bradley warned that capturing a city located in a region that the Soviets had already received at the Yalta Conference might cost 100,000 casualties,[43] by 15 April Eisenhower ordered all armies to halt when they reached the Elbe and Mulde Rivers, thus immobilizing these spearheads while the war continued for three more weeks. 21st Army Group was then instead ordered to move northeast toward Bremen and Hamburg. While the U.S. Ninth and First Armies held their ground from Magdeburg through Leipzig to western Czechoslovakia, Eisenhower ordered three Allied field armies (1st French, and the U.S. Seventh and Third Armies) into southeastern Germany and Austria. Advancing from northern Italy, the British Eighth Army[a] pushed to the borders of Yugoslavia to defeat the remaining *Wehrmacht* elements there.[42] This later caused some friction with the Yugoslav forces, notably around Trieste.\n\n\n\n### End of the Third Reich[edit]\n\n\nMain article: End of World War II in Europe\n\n![](image)People gathered in Whitehall to hear Winston Churchill's victory speech and celebrate Victory in Europe, 8 May 1945.\nThe US 6th Army Group fanned out to the southwest, passing to the east of Switzerland through Bavaria and into Austria and northern Italy.[*when?*] The Black Forest and Baden were overrun by the French First Army.[*when?*] Determined stands were made in April by German forces at Heilbronn, Nuremberg, and Munich but were overcome after several days.[*when?*] Elements of the US 3rd Infantry Division were the first Allied troops to arrive at Berchtesgaden, which they secured, while the French 2nd Armoured Division seized the Berghof (Hitler's Alpine residence) on 4 May 1945. German Army Group\u00a0G surrendered to US forces at Haar, in Bavaria, on 5 May. Field Marshal Montgomery took the German military surrender of all German forces in The Netherlands, northwest Germany and Denmark on L\u00fcneburg Heath, an area between the cities of Hamburg, Hanover and Bremen, on 4 May 1945. As the operational commander of some of these forces[*vague*][*clarification needed*] was Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz, the new Reichspr\u00e4sident (head of state) of the Third Reich this signaled that the European war was over.\n\n\nOn 7 May at his headquarters in Rheims, Eisenhower took the unconditional surrender of all German forces to the western Allies and the Soviet Union,[44] from the German Chief-of-Staff, General Alfred Jodl, who signed the first general instrument of surrender at 0241 hours. General Franz B\u00f6hme announced the unconditional surrender of German troops in Norway. Operations ceased at 23:01 hours Central European time (CET) on 8 May. On that same day Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, as head of OKW and Jodl's superior, was brought to Marshal Georgy Zhukov in Karlshorst and signed another instrument of surrender that was essentially identical to that signed in Rheims with two minor additions requested by the Soviets.[45]\n\n\n\n## Casualties[edit]\n\n\n### Allied[edit]\n\n\nThanks to competent management and industrial potential, the Allies suffered relatively low losses: 1,093,000 killed/wounded/missing. Apart from about 2 million prisoners, mostly French. As the main participant in the battles in 1944-1945, the United States suffered the highest losses: 147,783 killed and missing, 365,086 wounded, 73,759 captured.France suffered relatively high losses: 132,590 killed or missing, about 300,000 wounded, and 1,454,730 taken prisoner. Britain lost 58,000 killed, nearly 111,000 wounded and 56,000 captured.The rest of the allied countries lost 284,000 killed, wounded and captured (among them 24,000 killed and missing).[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Axis[edit]\n\n\nGerman losses are much more difficult to deal with, as different sources claim conflicting information. According to George Marshall, the Germans lost 263,000 killed. German historian R\u00fcdger Overmans points to other numbers: 244,891 killed and missing on the Western Front in 1944. He also claims that in the \"final battles\" from January to May 1945, Germany lost 1,230,000 killed and missing, of which 1/3 on the Western Front. Due to low morale, the Germans often surrendered. Unlike their colleagues on the Eastern Front and their Japanese colleagues, the Wehrmacht did not fight to the last and for the most part surrendered when the defeat was obvious. 7,614,790 were held in POW camps by early June of 1945 (including 3,404,950 who were disarmed following the surrender of Germany).[9] See also: Disarmed Enemy Forces\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Ultimately under the command of Field Marshal Harold Alexander, the supreme commander of the Mediterranean, not Eisenhower.\n\n\n1. **^** Vichy officially pursued a policy of armed neutrality and conducted military actions against armed incursions from both Axis and Allied belligerents. The cease fire and pledging of allegiance to the Allies of the Vichy troops in French North Africa during Operation Torch convinced the Axis that Vichy could no longer be trusted to continue this policy, so they invaded and occupied the French rump state in November 1942. Collaborationist units, such as the Milice, continued to fight alongside German troops against French Resistance fighters until the liberation of France in 1944.\n2. **^** Interlude with only minimal activity, excluding the Battle of Britain and The Blitz, between 25 June 1940 to 6 June 1944\n3. **^** Ellis provides no figure for Danish casualties, he places Norwegian losses at 2,000 killed or missing with no information provided on those wounded or captured.

Belgian casualties are placed at 7,500 killed or missing, 15,850 wounded, and 200,000 captured. French casualties amounted to 120,000 killed or missing, 250,000 wounded, and 1,450,000 taken prisoner. British losses totalled to 11,010 killed or missing, 14,070 wounded (only those who were evacuated have been counted), and 41,340 taken prisoner.[6] Losses in 1940, according to Ellis's information, thus amount to 2,121,560.\n4. **^** 360,000 dead or wounded, and 1,900,000 captured[7]\n5. **^** **Ellis's numbers:** American: 109,820 killed or missing, 356,660 wounded, and 56,630 captured; British: 30,280 killed or missing, 96,670 wounded, 14,700 captured; Canadian: 10,740 killed or missing, 30,910 wounded, 2,250 captured; French: 12,590 killed or missing, 49,510 wounded, 4,730 captured; Poles: 1,160 killed or missing, 3,840 wounded, 370 captured.[9]  \n Thus according to Ellis' information, the Western Allies incurred 783,860 casualties.  \n**US Army/Air Forces breakdown:** According to a post-war US Army study using war records, the army and army air forces of the United States suffered 586,628 casualties in western Europe, including 116,991 killed in action and 381,350 wounded, of whom 16,264 later died of their wounds.[10] Total US casualties come to 133,255 killed, 365,086 wounded, 73,759 captured, and 14,528 missing, two thousand of whom were later declared dead.\n6. **^** 43,110 Germans killed or missing, 111,640 wounded, no information is provided on any who were captured.

Washington, DC\u00a0: Center of Military History, 1996. Page 202 Archived 1 May 2017 at the Wayback Machine. US Army historian Charles B. MacDonald (*The European Theater of Operations: The Last Offensive*, Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington D.C., 1993, page 478) holds that \"exclusive of prisoners of war, all German casualties in the west from D-day to V\u2013E Day probably equaled or slightly exceeded Allied losses\". In the related footnote he writes the following: \"The only specific figures available are from OB WEST for the period 2 June 1941 \u2013 10 April 1945 as follows: Dead, 80,819; wounded, 265,526; missing, 490,624; total, 836,969. (Of the total, 4,548 casualties were incurred prior to D-day.) See Rpts, Der Heeresarzt im Oberkommando des Heeres Gen St d H/Gen Qu, Az.: 1335 c/d (IIb) Nr.: H.A./263/45 g. Kdos. of 14 Apr 45 and 1335 c/d (Ilb) (no date, but before 1945). The former is in OCMH X 313, a photostat of a document contained in German armament folder H 17/207; the latter in folder 0KW/1561 (OKW Wehrmacht Verluste). These figures are for the field army only, and do not include the Luftwaffe and Waffen-SS. Since the Germans seldom remained in control of the battlefield in a position to verify the status of those missing, a considerable percentage of the missing probably were killed. Time lag in reporting probably precludes these figures' reflecting the heavy losses during the Allied drive to the Rhine in March, and the cut-off date precludes inclusion of the losses in the Ruhr Pocket and in other stages of the fight in central Germany.\"\n9. **^** R\u00fcdiger Overmans, *Deutsche milit\u00e4rische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg*, Oldenbourg 2000. pp. 265, 266, 275 and 279. Based on extrapolations from a statistical sample (see German casualties in World War II), Overmans claims that losses on the Western Front amounted to 244,891 deaths (fallen, deaths from other causes or missing) in 1944 (Table 53, p. 266). As for 1945, Overmans claims that the German armed forces suffered 1,230,045 deaths in the \"Final Battles\" on the Eastern and Western Fronts from January to May 1945. This figure is broken down as follows (p. 272): 401,660 fallen, 131,066 dead from other causes, 697,319 missing. The number of missing obviously includes soldiers who fell into captivity and died there, possibly months or years later. (The number of deaths in captivity calculated by Overmans is about 459,000, thereof 363,000 in Soviet captivity (p. 286). Overmans' figure of deaths in Soviet captivity is about 700,000 lower than the number (ca. 1,094,000) established between 1962 and 1974 by a German government commission, the Maschke Commission. Overmans (p. 288f.) considers it \"plausible, though not provable\" that these additional 700,000 perished in Soviet captivity.) Nevertheless, Overmans claims (pp. 275, 279) that all 1,230,045 deaths occurred during the period from January to May 1945. He states that about 2/3 of these deaths occurred on the Eastern Front, without explaining how he arrived at this proportion (according to Table 59 on p. 277, there were 883,130 deaths on the Eastern Front between June and December 1944, and according to Table 53 on p. 266 there were 244,891 deaths on the Western Front in the whole of 1944; the relation between these two figures is 78.29% in the East vs. 21.71% in the West). This would leave 410,000 deaths attributable to the Western Allied invasion of Germany between January and May 1945. Overall Overmans estimates deaths on the Eastern Fronts (by all causes, including POW deaths) as 4 million, and deaths on all other fronts (including POW deaths and deaths attributable to bombing) as 1.3 million (p. 265). He believes the men reported as missing on the Eastern Front died either from combat or in captivity. On page 286, he estimates ~80,000 German troops died in Allied POW camps after the war: 34,000 in French camps, 22,000 in American camps, 21,000 in UK camps, and several thousand more in Belgian and Dutch camps.\n10. **^** Total German casualties between September 1939 to 31 December 1944, on the Western Front for both the army, Waffen SS, and foreign volunteers amounts to 128,030 killed, 399,860 wounded. 7,614,790 were held in POW camps by early June of 1945 (including 3,404,950 who were disarmed following the surrender of Germany)[9] See also: Disarmed Enemy Forces\n11. **^** All totals listed only include direct deaths due to military activity and crimes against humanity, including the Holocaust.[20]  \n**Germany: 910,000.** 410,000 in Allied strategic bombing, 300,000 in the Holocaust not including Austrian civilian deaths or deaths from the Nazi T4 program.[21] Counting the Aktion T4 program adds 200,000+ deaths to the total.[22]  \n**France: 390,000.** Includes 77,000 French Jews in the Holocaust.[23]  \n**Netherlands: 187,300.** Includes 100,000 Dutch Jews in the Holocaust.[24]  \n**Belgium: 76,000.** Includes 27,000 Belgian Jews in the Holocaust.[25]  \n**United Kingdom: 67,200.** Mostly died in German bombing.[26]  \n**Norway: 8,200.**[27] Includes 800 Norwegian Jews in the Holocaust.  \n**Denmark: 6,000.**[28]  \n**Luxembourg: 5,000.** Includes 2,000 Luxembourgish Jews.[29]\n12. **^** German deployments to the Western Front (plus Italy) reached levels as high as approximately 40% of their ground forces, and 75% of the Luftwaffe.

In the course of the ensuing winter campaign, the Wehrmacht suffered 510,000 losses in the East against 325,000 in the West. By April 1945, 1,960,000 German troops faced the 6.4\u00a0million Red Army troops at the gates of Berlin, in Czechoslovakia, and in numerous isolated pockets to the east, while four\u00a0million Allied forces in western Germany faced under one\u00a0million Wehrmacht soldiers. In May 1945 the Soviets accepted the surrender of almost 1.5\u00a0million men, while almost one\u00a0million Germans soldiers surrendered to the British and Americans, including many who fled west to escape the dreaded Red Army. \"The Soviet-German War 1941\u20131945: Myths and Realities: A Survey Essay\" (PDF).

The German and the Italian navies operated submarines and raiding ships in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, notably the Monsun Gruppe.\n\n\n\n### Theaters[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1942 and 1945, there were four main areas of conflict in the Pacific War: China, the Central Pacific, South-East Asia and the South West Pacific. US sources refer to two theaters within the Pacific War: the Pacific theater and the China Burma India Theater (CBI). However, these were not operational commands.\n\n\nIn the Pacific, the Allies divided operational control of their forces between two supreme commands, known as Pacific Ocean Areas and Southwest Pacific Area.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Willmott, H.P.

The First Operational Phase was further divided into three separate parts in which the major objectives of the Philippines, British Malaya, Borneo, Burma, Rabaul and the Dutch East Indies would be occupied. The Second Operational Phase called for further expansion into the South Pacific by seizing eastern New Guinea, New Britain, Fiji, Samoa, and strategic points in the Australian area. In the Central Pacific, Midway was targeted as were the Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific. Seizure of these key areas would provide defensive depth and deny the Allies staging areas from which to mount a counteroffensive.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** \"Losses\", Nav source.

The Japanese achieved great success in the initial phase of the campaign, but were gradually driven back using an island hopping strategy. The Allies adopted a Europe first stance, giving first priority to defeating Nazi Germany, but still managed to bring to bear the vast industrial might of the United States. The Japanese had great difficulty replacing their losses in ships and aircraft, while American factories and shipyards produced ever increasing numbers of both. Fighting included some of the largest naval battles in history and massive Allied air raids over Japan, as well as the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** \"Honouring NZ's Pacific War dead\".

Saipan and Tinian were used extensively by the US military as they finally put mainland Japan within round-trip range of American B-29s. Japanese forces attacked the bases on Saipan and Tinian from November 1944 to January 1945. The United States Army Air Forces based out of these islands conducted an intense strategic bombing campaign against Japanese cities of military and industrial importance, including Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe.\n\n\nThe invasion of Peleliu in the Palau Islands on 15 September, was notable for a drastic change in Japanese defensive tactics, resulting in the highest casualty rate amongst US forces in an amphibious operation during the Pacific War.[166] Instead of the predicted four days, it took until 27 November to secure the island. The strategic value of the landings is still contested.[167]\n\n\n\n### Philippine Sea[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Battle of the Philippine Sea\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJapan surrendered unconditionally on 15 August 1945 and was occupied by the Allies. Japan lost its former possessions in Asia and the Pacific and had its sovereignty limited to the four main home islands and other minor islands as determined by the Allies.[48]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Pacific War Council as photographed on 12 October 1942. Pictured are representatives from the United States (seated), Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, China, the Netherlands, and the Philippine Commonwealth\n### Names of the war[edit]\n\n\nIn Allied countries during the war, the \"Pacific War\" was not usually distinguished from World War II, or was known simply as the *War against Japan*. In the United States, the term *Pacific Theater* was widely used. The US Armed Forces considered the China-Burma-India Theater to be distinct from the Asiatic-Pacific Theater during the conflict.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy November these plans were essentially complete, and were modified only slightly over the next month. Japanese military planners' expectation of success rested on the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union being unable to effectively respond to a Japanese attack because of the threat posed to each by Germany; the Soviet Union was even seen as unlikely to commence hostilities.\n\n\nThe Japanese leadership was aware that a total military victory in a traditional sense against the US was impossible; the alternative would be negotiating for peace after their initial victories, which would recognize Japanese hegemony in Asia.[75]\n\n\n\n## Japanese offensives, 1941\u201342[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Japan campaign, Operation Downfall, and Air raids on Japan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Yenne, Bill (2014). *The Imperial Japanese Army: The Invincible Years 1941\u201342*.

This was followed on 1 June by simultaneous assaults in the northwest, on the island of Labuan and the coast of Brunei. A week later the Australians attacked Japanese positions in North Borneo. The attention of the Allies then switched back to the central east coast, with the last major amphibious assault of World War II, at Balikpapan on 1 July.\n\n\nAlthough the campaign was criticized in Australia as a \"waste\" of the lives of soldiers, it achieved a number of objectives, such as increasing the isolation of significant Japanese forces occupying the Dutch East Indies, capturing major oil supplies and freeing Allied prisoners of war, who were being held in deteriorating conditions.[206] At one of the very worst sites, around Sandakan in Borneo, only six of 2,500 British and Australian prisoners survived.[181]\n\n\n\n### Landings in the Japanese home islands (1945)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOpposition to war in the US vanished after the attack.

Four days after Pearl Harbor, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, drawing the country into a two-theater war.

The US used the ensuing period to turn its vast industrial potential into increased numbers of ships, planes, and trained aircrew.[133] At the same time, Japan, lacking an adequate industrial base or technological strategy, a good aircrew training program, or adequate naval resources and commerce defense, fell further and further behind. In strategic terms the Allies began a long movement across the Pacific, seizing one island base after another. Some Japanese strongholds like Truk, Rabaul, and Formosa, were neutralized by air attack and bypassed. The goal was to get close to Japan itself, then launch massive strategic air attacks, improve the submarine blockade, and finally (only if necessary) execute an invasion.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hornfischer, James D.

Japan increased its naval budget as well as putting large formations of the Army and its attached air force under navy command. While formerly the IJA consumed the lion's share of the state's military budget (with a 73/27 split in 1940), from 1942 to 1945 there would instead be a roughly 60/40 split in funds between the army and the navy.[70] Japan's key initial objective was to seize economic resources in the Dutch East Indies and Malaya to escape the effects of the Allied embargo.[71] This was known as the Southern Plan. It was decided\u2014because of the close relationship between the UK and the US,[72][*page\u00a0needed*][73][*page\u00a0needed*] and the (mistaken)[72][*page\u00a0needed*] belief that the US would inevitably become involved\u2014that Japan would also take the Philippines, Wake and Guam.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* McGibbon, Ian, ed.

The seizure of islands in the Ryukyus was to have been the last step before the actual invasion of the Japanese home islands. Okinawa, the largest of the Ryukyu Islands, was located 340 miles (550\u00a0km) from Kyushu.[190] The capture of Okinawa would provide airbases to intensify aerial bombardment of Japan and for direct land-based air support of the invasion of Kyushu.

Although the Japanese captured the city, the Chinese were able to pin them down long enough for reinforcements to arrive and encircle them.

This name was released to the public on 12 December, with an explanation that it involved Asian nations achieving their independence from the Western powers through armed forces of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.[49] Japanese officials integrated what they called the *Japan\u2013China Incident* (\u65e5\u652f\u4e8b\u5909, *Nisshi Jihen*) into the Greater East Asia War. During the Occupation of Japan (1945\u201352), these terms were prohibited in official documents (although their informal usage continued). The war became officially known as the Pacific War (\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u6226\u4e89, *Taiheiy\u014d Sens\u014d*). The *Fifteen Years' War* (\u5341\u4e94\u5e74\u6226\u4e89, *J\u016bgonen Sens\u014d*) is also used, referring to the period from the Mukden Incident of 1931 through 1945.\n\n\n\n### Participants[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Political map of the Asia-Pacific region, 1939\n#### Allies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the South Western Pacific the Allies seized the strategic initiative for the first time during the War and in June 1943, launched Operation Cartwheel, a series of amphibious invasions to recapture the Solomon Islands and New Guinea and ultimately isolate the major Japanese forward base at Rabaul. Following the Japanese Invasion of Salamaua\u2013Lae in March 1942, Cartwheel began with the Salamaua\u2013Lae campaign in Northern New Guinea in April 1943, which was followed in June to October by the New Georgia campaign, in which the Allies used the Landings on Rendova, Drive on Munda Point and Battle of Munda Point to secure a secretly constructed Japanese airfield at Munda and the rest of New Georgia Islands group.

In a series of amphibious assaults between 1 May and 21 July, the Australian I Corps, under General Leslie Morshead, attacked Japanese forces occupying the island. Allied naval and air forces, centered on the US 7th Fleet under Admiral Thomas Kinkaid, the Australian First Tactical Air Force and the US Thirteenth Air Force also played important roles in the campaign.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe battle for Okinawa proved costly and lasted much longer than the Americans had expected. The Japanese skillfully utilized terrain to inflict maximum casualties.[199] Total American casualties were 49,451, including 12,520 dead or missing and 36,631 wounded.[200] Japanese casualties were approximately 110,000 killed, and 7,400 taken prisoner.[200] 94% of the Japanese soldiers died along with many civilians.[201][*page\u00a0needed*] Kamikaze attacks also sank 36 ships, damaged 368 more and killed 4,900 US sailors, for the loss of 7,800 Japanese aircraft.[202]\n\n\n\n### China, 1945[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Battle of West Hunan and Second Guangxi Campaign\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Bombing of Darwin, Australia, 19 February 1942\nMeanwhile, Japanese aircraft had all but eliminated Allied air power in Southeast Asia and were making air attacks on northern Australia, beginning with a psychologically devastating but militarily insignificant bombing of the city of Darwin on 19 February, which killed at least 243 people.[90]\n\n\nAt the Battle of the Java Sea in late February and early March, the IJN inflicted a resounding defeat on the main ABDA naval force, under Admiral Karel Doorman.[91] The Dutch East Indies campaign subsequently ended with the surrender of Allied forces on Java and Sumatra.[92][93]\n\n\nIn March and April, a powerful IJN carrier force launched a raid into the Indian Ocean. British Royal Navy bases in Ceylon were hit and the aircraft carrier HMS\u00a0*Hermes* and other Allied ships were sunk.

A single Japanese carrier, *Hiry\u016b*, remained operational, and launched an immediate counterattack. Both of her attacks hit *Yorktown* and put her out of action. Later in the afternoon, aircraft from the two remaining American carriers found and destroyed *Hiry\u016b*. The crippled *Yorktown*, along with the destroyer *Hammann*, were sunk by the Japanese submarine *I-168*. With the striking power of the Kido Butai having been destroyed, Japan's offensive power was blunted.

China had already been engaged in a bloody war against Japan since 1937. The US and its territories, including the Philippine Commonwealth, entered the war after being attacked by Japan. The British Empire was also a major belligerent consisting of British troops along with large numbers of colonial troops from the armed forces of India as well as from Burma, Malaya, Fiji, Tonga; in addition to troops from Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The Dutch government-in-exile (as the possessor of the Dutch East Indies) was also involved. All of these were members of the Pacific War Council.[50] From 1944 the French commando group Corps L\u00e9ger d'Intervention also took part in resistance operations in Indochina. Some active pro-allied guerrillas in Asia included the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army, the Korean Liberation Army, the Free Thai Movement, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh,[51] and the Hukbalahap.[52][*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLeMay also oversaw Operation Starvation, in which the inland waterways of Japan were extensively mined by air, which disrupted the little remaining Japanese coastal sea traffic. On 26 July 1945, US President Harry S. Truman, Chiang, and Churchill issued the Potsdam Declaration, which outlined the terms of surrender for Japan as agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference. This ultimatum stated that, if Japan did not surrender, it would face \"prompt and utter destruction\".[210]\n\n\n\n### Atomic bombs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The mushroom cloud from the nuclear explosion over Nagasaki\nMain article: Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Fighting an undeclared war against Japan since 7 July 1937, declared war on 9 December 1941.[1]\n2. **^** Although Japan had been invading and occupying China since 1937, war was not officially declared.

Yamamoto got his Midway operation, but only after he had threatened to resign.

It included campaigns fought in the Libyan and Egyptian deserts (Western Desert campaign, also known as the Desert War) and in Morocco and Algeria (Operation Torch), as well as Tunisia (Tunisia campaign). The campaign was fought between the Allies and the Axis Powers. The Allied war effort was dominated by the British Commonwealth and exiles from German-occupied Europe. The United States officially entered the war in December 1941 and began direct military assistance in North Africa on 11 May 1942.\n\n\nFighting in North Africa started with the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940. On 14 June, the British 11th Hussars and part of the 1st Royal Tank Regiment, 1st RTR) crossed the border from Egypt into Libya and captured Fort Capuzzo. This was followed by an Italian counter-offensive into Egypt and the capture of Sidi Barrani in September. The British recaptured Sidi Barrani in December during Operation Compass. The Italian 10th Army was destroyed and the German *Afrika Korps* was dispatched to North Africa in February 1941 in Operation Sonnenblume to reinforce Italians and prevent an Axis defeat.\n\n\nBattles for control of Libya and Egypt followed, with advances and retreats until the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942 when the Eighth Army (Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery) defeated the German\u2013Italian *Panzerarmee Afrika* and forced its remnants into Tunisia. After Operation Torch, the Anglo-American landings in North-West Africa in November 1942 and fighting against Vichy France forces (which then changed sides), the Allies trapped about 250,000 German and Italian personnel in northern Tunisia, forcing their surrender in May 1943.\n\n\nInformation gleaned via British Ultra code-breaking was important in the Allied victory in North Africa. The Italian campaign followed, which culminated in the downfall of the fascist government in Italy and the elimination of Germany's main European ally. German and Italian forces committed atrocities against prisoners of war and Jewish, Berber and Arab populations.\n\n\n\n\n## Western Desert campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Western Desert campaign\n\n![](image)A British Matilda Mk II named \"Glenorchy\" of Major K.P. Harris, MC, commander of 'D' Squadron, 7th Royal Tank Regiment during Operation Compass displaying an Italian flag captured at Tobruk, 24 January 1941\n![](image)The Italian Empire in November 1942\nOn 10 May 1940, the Wehrmacht started the Battle of France (or *Westfeldzug*). Six weeks later, France surrendered. The Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne took place on 22 June 1940 leaving the Vichy government in control of French territory not occupied by Germany.\n\n\nOn 10 June, the Kingdom of Italy aligned itself with Nazi Germany and declared war upon France and the United Kingdom.[13] British forces (along with Indian and Rhodesian troops) based in Egypt were ordered to take defensive measures, but to avoid provocation as much as possible.[14] However, on 11 June they began a series of raids against Italian positions in Libya.[15] Following the defeat of France on 25 June, Italian forces in Tripolitania\u2014facing French troops based in Tunisia\u2014redeployed to Cyrenaica to reinforce the Italian Tenth Army.[16] This, coupled with the steadily degrading equipment of the British forces, led General Archibald Wavell to order an end to the raids and place the defence of the Egyptian border with a small screening force.[17]\n\n\nItalian dictator Benito Mussolini ordered the Tenth Army to invade Egypt by 8 August. Two days later, no invasion having been launched, Mussolini ordered Marshal Graziani that, the moment German forces launched Operation Sea Lion to invade Great Britain, he was to attack.[18] Beaten in the Battle of Britain, the German invasion never took place. On 8 September, the Italians\u2014hampered by a lack of transport, enfeebled by the low level of training among officers, and weakened by the state of its supporting equipment[16]\u2014were ordered to invade Egypt the following day. The battle plan was to advance along the coastal road while limited armoured forces operated on the desert flank.[17]\n\n\nTo counter the Italian advance, Wavell ordered his screening forces to harass the advancing Italians, falling back towards Mersa Matruh, where the main British infantry force was based. Positioned on the desert flank was the 7th Armoured Division, which would strike at the flank of the Italian force.[19][20]\n\n\nBy 16 September, the Italian force had advanced to Maktila, around 130 kilometres (80\u00a0mi) west of Mersa Matruh, where they halted due to supply problems.[21] Despite Mussolini urging them to carry on, Graziani ordered his men to dig in around Sidi Barrani, and fortified camps were established in forward locations; additional troops were also positioned behind the main force.[22] In response to the dispersed Italian camps, the British planned a limited five-day attack, Operation Compass, to strike at these fortified camps one by one.[23][24] The British Commonwealth force, totalling 36,000 men,[25] attacked the forward elements of the 10-division-strong Italian army on 9 December.[26] Following their initial success, the forces of Operation Compass[27] pursued the retreating Italian forces.[28] In January, the small port at Bardia was taken,[29] soon followed by the seizure of the fortified port of Tobruk.[30]\n\n\nSome 40,000 Italians were captured in and around the two ports, with the remainder of the Tenth Army retreating along the coast road back to El Agheila. Richard O'Connor sent the 7th Armoured Division across the desert with a small reconnaissance group. It reached Beda Fomm some ninety minutes before the Italians, cutting off their retreat. Although they tried desperately to overcome the British force at the Battle of Beda Fomm, the Italians were unable to break through, and the remnants of the retreating army surrendered. Over ten weeks Allied forces had destroyed the Italian Tenth Army and reached El Agheila, taking 130,000 prisoners of war in the process.[31][32][33]\n\n\nMussolini requested help from his German allies, while the Italian *Comando Supremo* (\"high command\") speedily sent several large motorized and armoured forces to protect their colonies in North Africa.[34] This greatly expanded reinforcement included the soon-to-be-renowned *Ariete* Armoured division under General Ettore Baldassarre.[35] Meanwhile, the Germans hastily assembled a motorized force, whose lead elements arrived in Tripoli in February. This relatively small expeditionary force, termed the *Afrika Korps* by Adolf Hitler, was placed under the command of Erwin Rommel. His orders were to reinforce the Italians and block Allied attempts to drive them out of the region.[36][37] However, the initial commitment of only one panzer division and subsequently, no more than two panzer and one motorized divisions, indicated the limited extent of German involvement and commitment to this theatre of operations.[35] The bulk of the reinforcements were Italian and therefore it was up to the Italians to do the bulk of the fighting. The forward Allied force\u2014now named XIII Corps\u2014adopted a defensive posture and over the coming months was built up, before most of its veteran forces were redeployed to Greece to counter the German invasion there. In addition, the 7th Armoured Division was withdrawn to the Nile delta.[38][39][40] The veteran forces were replaced by inexperienced newcomers, ill-equipped to face German armour.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Erwin Rommel with Italian governor of Libya, General Italo Gariboldi (on Rommel's right), in Tripoli, February 1941\nAlthough Rommel had been ordered to simply hold the line, an armoured reconnaissance soon became a full-fledged offensive from El Agheila in March.[36][37] In March\u2013April, Allied forces were forced back[42] and leading general officers captured. The Australian 9th Infantry Division fell back to the fortress port of Tobruk,[43] and the remaining British and Commonwealth forces withdrew a further 160 kilometres (100\u00a0mi) east to the Libyan\u2013Egyptian border.[44] With Tobruk under siege by the main Italian-German force, a small battlegroup continued to press eastwards. Capturing Fort Capuzzo and Bardia in passing, it then advanced into Egypt, and by the end of April it had taken Sollum and the tactically important Halfaya Pass. Rommel garrisoned these positions, reinforcing the battle-group and ordering it onto the defensive.[45][46]\n\n\nThough isolated on land, Tobruk's garrison continued to receive supplies and replacements, delivered by the Royal Navy at night. Rommel's forces did not have the strength or training to take the fortress. This created a supply problem for his forward units. His front-line positions at Sollum were at the end of an extended supply chain that stretched back to Tripoli and had to bypass the coast road at Tobruk. Further, he was constantly threatened with a breakout of the British forces at Tobruk.[47] Without Tobruk in Axis hands, further advances into Egypt were impractical.[48][49]\n\n\nThe Allies launched a small-scale counter-attack called Operation Brevity in an attempt to push Axis forces off the key passes at the border, with some initial success. However they could not hold the advance positions and followed *Brevity* up with a much larger-scale offensive, Operation Battleaxe intended to relieve the siege at Tobruk, but this operation also failed.\n\n\nFollowing the failure of Operation Battleaxe, Archibald Wavell was relieved of command and replaced by Claude Auchinleck. The Western Desert Force was reinforced with a second corps, XXX Corps, with the two corps forming the Eighth Army. Eighth Army was made up of army forces from the Commonwealth nations, including the British Army, the Australian Army, the Indian Army, the New Zealand Army, the South African Army, and the Sudan Defence Force. There was also a brigade of Free French under Marie-Pierre Koenig.\n\n\n\n![](image)M13/40 tanks of the *Ariete* Armored Division on the attack during the Battle of Gazala\nThe new formation launched a new offensive, Operation Crusader, in November. After a see-saw battle, the 70th Division garrisoning Tobruk was relieved and the Axis forces were forced to fall back. By January 1942, the front line was again at El Agheila.\n\n\nAfter receiving supplies and reinforcements from Tripoli, the Axis attacked again, defeating the Allies in the Battle of Gazala in June and capturing Tobruk. The Axis forces drove the Eighth Army back over the Egyptian border, but their advance was stopped in July only 90 miles (140\u00a0km) from Alexandria in the First Battle of El Alamein.\n\n\nOf great significance, on 29 June reports of British military operations in North Africa sent to Washington by the US military attach\u00e9 in Cairo, Bonner Fellers, no longer used the compromised \"Black Code\" which the Axis forces had been reading, so the Axis could no longer learn of British \"strengths, positions, losses, reinforcements, supply, situation, plans, morale etc\" as they had since 1940.\n\n\nGeneral Auchinleck, although he had checked Rommel's advance at the First Battle of El Alamein, was replaced by General Harold Alexander. Lieutenant-General William Gott was promoted from XIII Corps commander to command of the entire Eighth Army, but he was killed when his aircraft was intercepted and shot down over Egypt. He was replaced by Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery.\n\n\nAt the end of June, Axis forces made a second attempt to break through the Allied defences at El Alamein at Alam Halfa, but were unsuccessful. After a lengthy period of build-up and training, the Eighth Army launched a major offensive, decisively defeating the Italian-German army in the Second Battle of El Alamein in late October, driving Axis forces west and capturing Tripoli in mid-January 1943. By February, the Eighth Army was facing the Italian-German *Panzer* Army near the Mareth Line and came under command of Alexander's 18th Army Group for the concluding phase of the war in North Africa\u00a0\u2013 the Tunisia campaign.\n\n\n\n## Operation Torch[edit]\n\n\n![](image)American troops on board a Landing Craft Assault heading into Oran, November 1942\nMain article: Operation Torch\n\nOperation Torch in November 1942 was a compromise operation that met the British objective of securing victory in North Africa while allowing American armed forces the opportunity to engage in the fight against Nazi Germany on a limited scale.[50] In addition, as Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, had long been pleading for a second front to be opened to engage the Wehrmacht and relieve pressure on the Red Army, it provided some degree of relief for the Red Army on the Eastern Front by diverting Axis forces to the North African theatre. Over half the German Ju 52 transport planes that were needed to supply the encircled Axis forces at Stalingrad were tied up supplying Axis forces in North Africa.[51]\n\n\nSenior U.S. commanders were strongly opposed to proposed landings in North-West Africa. After the western Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) met in London on 30 July 1942 General George Marshall and Admiral Ernest King declined to approve the plan. Marshall and other U.S. generals advocated the invasion of northern Europe later that year, which the British rejected.[52][53] After Prime Minister Winston Churchill pressed for a landing in French North Africa in 1942, Marshall suggested instead to President Franklin D. Roosevelt that the U.S. abandon the Germany first strategy and take the offensive in the Pacific. Roosevelt said it would do nothing to help Russia.[54] With Marshall unable to persuade the British to change their minds,[55] President Roosevelt gave a direct order that Operation Torch was to have precedence over other operations and was to take place at the earliest possible date, one of only two direct orders he gave to military commanders during the war.\n\n\nThe landings started on 8 November, and finished on 16 November. In an attempt to pincer German and Italian forces, Allied forces (American and British Commonwealth) landed in Vichy-held French North Africa under the assumption that there would be little to no resistance. Nevertheless, Vichy French forces put up a strong and bloody resistance to the Allies in Oran and Morocco, but not in Algiers, where a *coup d'\u00e9tat* by the French resistance on 8 November succeeded in neutralizing the French XIX Corps before the landing and arresting the Vichy commanders. Consequently, the landings met no practical opposition in Algiers, and the city was captured on the first day along with the entire Vichy African command. After three days of talks and threats, Generals Mark Clark and Dwight Eisenhower compelled Vichy Admiral Fran\u00e7ois Darlan and General Alphonse Juin to order the cessation on 10\u201311 November of armed resistance from Vichy forces in Oran and Morocco, promising to make Darlan the head of a Free French administration. During Operation Torch, Americans fought Vichy French and German navy vessels in the Naval Battle of Casablanca, which ended in an American victory.\n\n\nThe Allied landings prompted the Axis occupation of Vichy France (Case Anton). In addition, the Italians captured the French fleet at Toulon, which did them little good, as the main portion of the fleet had been scuttled to prevent their use by the Axis.\n\n\nThe Vichy Army in North Africa joined the Allies.\n\n\n\n## Tunisian campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tunisian campaign\n\nFollowing the Operation Torch landings\u2014from early November 1942\u2014the Germans and Italians initiated a buildup of troops in Tunisia to fill the vacuum left by Vichy troops which had withdrawn. During this period of weakness, the Allies decided against a rapid advance into Tunisia while they wrestled with the Vichy authorities. Many of the Allied soldiers were tied up in garrison duties because of the uncertain status and intentions of the Vichy forces.\n\n\n\n![](image)Captured Tiger I tank #712 of the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion[56]\nBy mid-November, the Allies were able to advance into Tunisia, but only in single division strength. By early December, the Eastern Task Force\u2014which had been redesignated as the British First Army under Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson\u2014was composed of the British 78th Infantry Division, British 6th Armoured Division, 1st Parachute Brigade, No. 6 Commando and elements of US 1st Armored Division. But by this time, one German and five Italian divisions had been shipped from Europe and the remoteness of Allied airfields from the front line gave the Axis clear air superiority over the battlefield. The Allies were halted and pushed back having advanced eastwards to within 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) of Tunis.\n\n\nIn early December, the Allies were met with the reality that they would not be successful in capturing the key cities of Tunis and Bizerta. The air campaigns by the Axis forces proved to be a difficult challenge for the British forces. However, the Allies were left with the advantage of having secured the island of Malta, enabling the Allies to carry out future aerial operations. Additionally, on land, allied British and American forces were able to hold onto their possessions. On December 4, 1942, the Allied Force Headquarters in North Africa reported that military operations were ongoing in the Tebourba area. The Axis powers attempted a second counter-attack in the neighborhood of Tebourba following their failed attempt on December 1. The attack was successfully repulsed by the Allied powers, and the enemy sustained significant damage to their weaponry. During the winter, there followed a period of stalemate during which time both sides continued to build up their forces. By the new year, the British First Army had one British, one US and one French Corps (a second British Corps headquarters was activated in April). In the second half of February, in eastern Tunisia, Rommel and von Arnim had some successes against the mainly inexperienced French and US troops, most notably in routing the US II Corps commanded by Major General Lloyd Fredendall at the Battle of Kasserine Pass.\n\n\nBy the beginning of March, the British Eighth Army\u2014advancing westward along the North African coast\u2014had reached the Tunisian border. Rommel and von Arnim found themselves in an Allied \"two army\" pincer. They were outflanked, outmanned and outgunned. Rommel went back to Germany for health reasons and was substituted by the Italian general Messe.\n\n\nThe British Eighth Army bypassed the Axis defence on the Mareth Line in late March after harsh fighting[*citation needed*] and First Army in central Tunisia launched their main offensive in mid-April to squeeze the Axis forces until their resistance in Africa collapsed. The Axis forces surrendered on 13 May 1943 yielding over 275,000 prisoners of war. The last Axis force to surrender in North Africa was the 1st Italian Army of general Messe.[57] This huge loss of experienced troops greatly reduced the military capacity of the Axis powers, although some Axis troops escaped Tunisia. This defeat in Africa led to all Italian colonies in Africa being captured.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Intelligence[edit]\n\n\n### Axis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A German Signals reception unit in the desert\nThe Axis had considerable success in intelligence gathering through radio communication intercepts and monitoring unit radio traffic. The most important success came through intercepting the reports of Fellers, the US military attach\u00e9 in Egypt. He had been tasked by Marshall with providing detailed reports on the military situation in Africa.[58] Fellers talked with British military and civilian headquarters personnel, read documents and visited the battlefront. Known to the Germans as \"die gute Quelle\" (the good source) or more jokingly as 'the little fellow', he transmitted his reports back to Washington using the \"Black Code\" of the US State Department. However, in September 1941, the Italians had stolen a code book containing the Black Code, photographed it and returned it to the US embassy in Rome.[59] The Italians shared parts of their intercepts with their German allies. In addition the \"Chiffrierabteilung\" (German military cipher branch) were soon able to break the code. Fellers' reports were very detailed and played a significant role in informing the Germans of allied strength and intentions between January and June 1942 \n\n\nIn addition, the Italian *Servizio Informazioni Segrete* or SIS code-breakers were able to successfully intercept much radio encrypted signals intelligence (SIGINT) from British aircraft traffic as well as first-class ciphers from British vessels and land bases, providing Supermarina (Regia Marina) with timely warnings of Allied intentions in the Mediterranean.[60] Indeed, so successful was the Italian SIS in handling the bulk of Axis naval intelligence in the Mediterranean, that \"Britain's offensive use of SIGINT was largely negated by Italy's defensive SIGINT.\"[61]\n\n\nThe Afrika Korps had the intelligence services of the 621st Signals Battalion mobile monitoring element which arrived in North Africa in late April 1941,[62] commanded by Hauptmann Alfred Seeb\u00f6hm. The 621st Signals Battalion monitored radio communications among British units. Unfortunately for the Allies, the British not only failed to change their codes with any frequency, they were also prone to poor radio discipline in combat. Their officers made frequent open, uncoded transmissions to their commands, allowing the Germans to more easily identify British units and deployments.[58] The situation changed after a counterattack during the Battle of Gazala resulted in the 621st Signals Battalion being overrun and destroyed, and a number of their documents captured, alerting British intelligence to the problem.[63] The British responded by instituting an improved call signal procedure, introducing radiotelephonic codes, imposing rigid wireless silence on reserve formations, padding out real messages with dummy traffic, tightening up on their radio discipline in combat and creating an entire fake signals network in the southern sector.[63]\n\n\n\n### Allies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colossus Mark II computer at Bletchley Park\nAllied codebreakers read much enciphered German message traffic, especially that encrypted with the Enigma machine. The Allies' Ultra programme was initially of limited value, as it took too long to get the information to the commanders in the field, and at times provided information that was less than helpful.[64] In terms of anticipating the next move the Germans would make, reliance on Ultra sometimes backfired. Part of the reason the initial German attacks in March 1941 were so successful was that Ultra intercepts had informed Wavell that OKW had clearly directed Rommel not to take any offensive action, but to wait until he was further reinforced with the 15th Panzer Division in May.[65] Rommel received this information, but placed more value on his own assessment of the situation. Trusting that the Germans had no intention of taking major action, the British command did not respond until it was too late.[66] Furthermore, Rommel did not generally provide OKW or the Italian *Comando Supremo* details of his planned operations, for he thought the Italians too prone to leak the information. Thus on 21 January 1942, when Rommel struck out on his second offensive from El Agheila, *Comando Supremo* was just as surprised to learn of it as the British were.[67] Ultra intercepts provided the British with such information as the name of the new German commander, his time of arrival, and the numbers and condition of the Axis forces, but they might not correctly reveal Rommel's intentions.\n\n\n\n![](image)British SAS patrol in armed jeeps\nThe primary benefit of Ultra intercepts to the effort in North Africa was to aid in cutting the Axis supply line to Tunisia. Ultra intercepts provided valuable information about the times and routes of Axis supply shipments across the Mediterranean. This was critical in providing the British with the opportunity to intercept and destroy them. During the time when Malta was under heavy air attack, the ability to act on this information was limited, but as Allied air and naval strength improved, the information became instrumental to Allied success. It is estimated that 40% to 60% of Axis supply shipping was located and destroyed due to decrypted information.[68][69] However, this claim is strongly disputed by the authors Vincent P. O'Hara and Enrico Cernuschi (2013) who claim that authors like F.H. Hinsley have greatly exaggerated the effects of ULTRA. For example, they claim that intelligence provided by ULTRA had little impact in stopping Italian convoys reaching North Africa. Of the 2.67\u00a0million tons of materiel, fuel, and munitions shipped to Africa\u2014nearly all in Italian vessels and under Italian escort\u20142.24\u00a0million tons managed to arrive despite the best efforts of ULTRA and the British Navy to prevent it.[70] In effect, \"Ultra did not deny the Axis armies the supplies they needed to reach the Nile.\"[61]\n\n\nHeavy losses of German paratroopers during the Battle of Crete, made possible by Ultra warnings of the drop times and locations, meant that Hitler hesitated in attacking Malta,[71] which aided the British in gaining control of the Mediterranean, as did the losses of the Italian Navy at the Battle of Cape Matapan.[72] To conceal the fact that German coded messages were being read, a fact critical to the overall Allied war effort, British command required a flyover mission be carried out before a convoy could be attacked in order to give the appearance that a reconnaissance flight had discovered the target.\n\n\n\n## Atrocities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Jews outside Europe under Axis occupation\n\nThe North African campaign was often labeled a \"war without hate\", a pure military clash in the desert without the partisan roundups and ethnic cleansing happening in Europe. This view has been challenged by recent historians, given that there were indeed many civilians who lived in the region,[73] and the campaign was marked by numerous atrocities and abuses by both Italian and German forces towards Allied prisoners of war and local Jewish, Berber, and Arab populations.[74] These acts were often motivated by racism and antisemitism.[75]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wehrmacht fuel barrel in Tunisia, 2010\nAfter victory by the Allies in the North African campaign, the stage was set for the Italian campaign to begin. The invasion of Sicily followed two months later. Nearly 400,000 Axis and Allied troops were lost, injured or died of disease by the end of the North African campaign.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of British military equipment of World War II\n\n\n\n* List of equipment of the United States Army during World War II\n* List of French military equipment of World War II\n* List of German military equipment of World War II\n* List of Italian Army equipment in World War II\n* List of North African campaign battles\n* North African campaign timeline\n* Timelines of World War II by year: 1940\u00a0/ 1941\u00a0/ 1942\u00a0/ 1943\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** November 1942 to May 1943.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** 8\u201311 November 1942.
