Brazilians call this section the Solimões River above its confluence with the Rio Negro[22] forming what Brazilians call the Amazon at the Meeting of Waters (Portuguese: *Encontro das Águas*) at Manaus, the largest city on the river.\n\n\nThe Amazon River has an average discharge of about 215,000–230,000 m3/s (7,600,000–8,100,000 cu ft/s)—approximately 6,591–7,570 km3 (1,581–1,816 cu mi) per year, greater than the next seven largest independent rivers combined. Two of the top ten rivers by discharge are tributaries of the Amazon river. The Amazon represents 20% of the global riverine discharge into oceans.[23] The Amazon basin is the largest drainage basin in the world, with an area of approximately 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi).[2] The portion of the river's drainage basin in Brazil alone is larger than any other river's basin. The Amazon enters Brazil with only one-fifth of the flow it finally discharges into the Atlantic Ocean, yet already has a greater flow at this point than the discharge of any other river.[24][25]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon was initially known by Europeans as the Marañón, and the Peruvian part of the river is still known by that name today. It later became known as Rio Amazonas in Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n\nThe name Rio Amazonas was reportedly given after native warriors attacked a 16th-century expedition by Francisco de Orellana. The warriors were led by women, reminding de Orellana of the Amazon warriors, a tribe of women warriors related to Iranian Scythians and Sarmatians[26][27] mentioned in Greek mythology.\nThe word Amazon itself may be derived from the Iranian compound \\* ha-maz-an- \"(one) fighting together\"[28] or ethnonym *\\* ha-mazan-* \"warriors\", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in Hesychius of Alexandria's gloss \"ἁμαζακάραν· πολεμεῖν. Πέρσαι\" (\"**hamazakaran**: 'to make war' in Persian\"), where it appears together with the Indo-Iranian root *\\* kar-* \"make\" (from which Sanskrit *karma* is also derived).[29]\n\n\nOther scholars[*who?*] claim that the name is derived from the Tupi word *amassona*, meaning \"boat destroyer\".[30]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Timeline of Amazon history\n\n### Geological history[edit]\n\n\nRecent geological studies suggest that for millions of years the Amazon River used to flow in the opposite direction - from east to west. Eventually the Andes Mountains formed, blocking its flow to the Pacific Ocean, and causing it to switch directions to its current mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.[31]\n\n\n\n### Pre-Columbian era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old drawing (from 1879) of Arapaima fishing at the Amazon river. The arapaima has been on Earth for at least 23 million years.[32]\nDuring what many archaeologists called the *formative stage*, Amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of South America's highland agrarian systems. The trade with Andean civilizations in the terrains of the headwaters in the Andes formed an essential contribution to the social and religious development of higher-altitude civilizations like the Muisca and Incas. Early human settlements were typically based on low-lying hills or mounds.\n\n\nShell mounds were the earliest evidence of habitation; they represent piles of human refuse (waste) and are mainly dated between 7500 BC and 4000 BC. They are associated with ceramic age cultures; no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists.[33] Artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds. They are best represented by the Marajoara culture. Figurative mounds are the most recent types of occupation.\n\n\nThere is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed towns and cities.[34] Archaeologists estimate that by the time the Spanish conquistador De Orellana traveled across the Amazon in 1541, more than 3 million indigenous people lived around the Amazon.[35] These pre-Columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations. For instance, pre-Columbian indigenous people on the island of Marajó may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people. To achieve this level of development, the indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest altered the forest's ecology by selective cultivation and the use of fire. Scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repeatedly, the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients. This created dark soil areas known as *terra preta de índio* (\"Indian dark earth\").[36] Because of the terra preta, indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures. Further research has hypothesized that this practice began around 11,000 years ago. Some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the Amazon basin.[36]\n\n\nMany indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. According to James S. Olson, \"The Munduruku expansion (in the 18th century) dislocated and displaced the Kawahíb, breaking the tribe down into much smaller groups ... [Munduruku] first came to the attention of Europeans in 1770 when they began a series of widespread attacks on Brazilian settlements along the Amazon River.\"[37]\n\n\n\n### Arrival of Europeans[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon tributaries near Manaus\nIn March 1500, Spanish conquistador Vicente Yáñez Pinzón was the first documented European to sail up the Amazon River.[38] Pinzón called the stream *Río Santa María del Mar Dulce*, later shortened to *Mar Dulce*, literally, *sweet sea*, because of its freshwater pushing out into the ocean. Another Spanish explorer, Francisco de Orellana, was the first European to travel from the origins of the upstream river basins, situated in the Andes, to the mouth of the river. In this journey, Orellana baptized some of the affluents of the Amazonas like Rio Negro, Napo and Jurua.\nThe name Amazonas is thought to be taken from the native warriors that attacked this expedition, mostly women, that reminded De Orellana of the mythical female Amazon warriors from the ancient Hellenic culture in Greece (see also Origin of the name).\n\n\n\n### Exploration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Fritz's 1707 map showing the Amazon and the Orinoco\nGonzalo Pizarro set off in 1541 to explore east of Quito into the South American interior in search of *El Dorado*, the \"city of gold\" and La Canela, the \"valley of cinnamon\".[39] He was accompanied by his second-in-command Francisco de Orellana. After 170 km (106 mi), the Coca River joined the Napo River (at a point now known as Puerto Francisco de Orellana); the party stopped for a few weeks to build a boat just upriver from this confluence. They continued downriver through an uninhabited area, where they could not find food. Orellana offered and was ordered to follow the Napo River, then known as *Río de la Canela* (\"Cinnamon River\"), and return with food for the party. Based on intelligence received from a captive native chief named Delicola, they expected to find food within a few days downriver by ascending another river to the north.\n\n\nDe Orellana took about 57 men, the boat, and some canoes and left Pizarro's troops on 26 December 1541. However, De Orellana missed the confluence (probably with the Aguarico) where he was searching supplies for his men. By the time he and his men reached another village, many of them were sick from hunger and eating \"noxious plants\", and near death. Seven men died in that village. His men threatened to mutiny if the expedition turned back to attempt to rejoin Pizarro, the party being over 100 leagues downstream at this point. He accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of Spain, and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream. After a journey of 600 km (370 mi) down the Napo River, they reached a further major confluence, at a point near modern Iquitos, and then followed the upper Amazon, now known as the Solimões, for a further 1,200 km (746 mi) to its confluence with the Rio Negro (near modern Manaus), which they reached on 3 June 1542.\n\n\nRegarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon, Pizarro reported to the king that they had found cinnamon trees, but that they could not be profitably harvested. True cinnamon (*Cinnamomum Verum*) is not native to South America. Other related cinnamon-containing plants (of the family *Lauraceae*) are fairly common in that part of the Amazon and Pizarro probably saw some of these. The expedition reached the mouth of the Amazon on 24 August 1542, demonstrating the practical navigability of the Great River.\n\n\n\n![](image)Masked-dance, and wedding-feast of Ticuna Indians, engravings for Bates's 1863 *The Naturalist on the River Amazons*\nIn 1560, another Spanish conquistador, Lope de Aguirre, may have made the second descent of the Amazon. Historians are uncertain whether the river he descended was the Amazon or the Orinoco River, which runs more or less parallel to the Amazon further north.\n\n\nPortuguese explorer Pedro Teixeira was the first European to travel up the entire river. He arrived in Quito in 1637, and returned via the same route.[40]\n\n\nFrom 1648 to 1652, Portuguese Brazilian *bandeirante* António Raposo Tavares led an expedition from São Paulo overland to the mouth of the Amazon, investigating many of its tributaries, including the Rio Negro, and covering a distance of over 10,000 km (6,200 mi).\n\n\nIn what is currently in Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, several colonial and religious settlements were established along the banks of primary rivers and tributaries for trade, slaving, and evangelization among the indigenous peoples of the vast rainforest, such as the Urarina. In the late 1600s, Czech Jesuit Father Samuel Fritz, an apostle of the Omagus established some forty mission villages. Fritz proposed that the Marañón River must be the source of the Amazon, noting on his 1707 map that the Marañón \"has its source on the southern shore of a lake that is called Lauricocha, near Huánuco.\" Fritz reasoned that the Marañón is the largest river branch one encounters when journeying upstream, and lies farther to the west than any other tributary of the Amazon. For most of the 18th–19th centuries and into the 20th century, the Marañón was generally considered the source of the Amazon.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Henry Walter Bates was most famous for his expedition to the Amazon (1848–1859).\n### Scientific exploration[edit]\n\n\nEarly scientific, zoological, and botanical exploration of the Amazon River and basin took place from the 18th century through the first half of the 19th century.\n\n\n\n* Charles Marie de La Condamine explored the river in 1743.[42]\n* Alexander von Humboldt, 1799–1804\n* Johann Baptist von Spix and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius, 1817–1820\n* Georg von Langsdorff, 1826–1828\n* Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace, 1848–1859\n* Richard Spruce, 1849–1864\n\n\n### Post-colonial exploitation and settlement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazonas state\n![Amazon Theatre opera house in Manaus built in 1896 during the rubber boom](image)\nAmazon Theatre opera house in Manaus built in 1896 during the rubber boom\n![Metropolitan Cathedral of Santarém, in Santarém, Brazil](image)\nMetropolitan Cathedral of Santarém, in Santarém, Brazil\n\n![](image)Iglesia Matriz in Iquitos, Peru\nThe Cabanagem revolt (1835–1840) was directed against the white ruling class. It is estimated that from 30% to 40% of the population of Grão-Pará, estimated at 100,000 people, died.[43]\n\n\nThe population of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon basin in 1850 was perhaps 300,000, of whom about 175,000 were Europeans and 25,000 were slaves. The Brazilian Amazon's principal commercial city, Pará (now Belém), had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, including slaves. The town of Manáos, now Manaus, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had a population between 1,000 and 1,500. All the remaining villages, as far up as Tabatinga, on the Brazilian frontier of Peru, were relatively small.[44]\n\n\nOn 6 September 1850, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the Amazon and gave the Viscount of Mauá (Irineu Evangelista de Sousa) the task of putting it into effect. He organised the \"Companhia de Navegação e Comércio do Amazonas\" in Rio de Janeiro in 1852; in the following year it commenced operations with four small steamers, the *Monarca* ('Monarch'), the *Cametá*, the *Marajó* and the *Rio Negro*.[44][45]\n\n\nAt first, navigation was principally confined to the main river; and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between Pará and Manaus, with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity, a second line to make six round voyages a year between Manaus and Tabatinga, and a third, two trips a month between Pará and Cametá.[44] This was the first step in opening up the vast interior.\n\n\nThe success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the Amazon, and a second company soon opened commerce on the Madeira, Purús, and Negro; a third established a line between Pará and Manaus, and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams. In that same period, the Amazonas Company was increasing its fleet. Meanwhile, private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries.[44]\n\n\nOn 31 July 1867, the government of Brazil, constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the upper Amazon basin, especially Peru, decreed the opening of the Amazon to all countries, but they limited this to certain defined points: Tabatinga – on the Amazon; Cametá – on the Tocantins; Santarém – on the Tapajós; Borba – on the Madeira, and Manaus – on the Rio Negro. The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867.[44]\n\n\nThanks in part to the mercantile development associated with steamboat navigation coupled with the internationally driven demand for natural rubber, the Peruvian city of Iquitos became a thriving, cosmopolitan center of commerce. Foreign companies settled in Iquitos, from where they controlled the extraction of rubber. In 1851 Iquitos had a population of 200, and by 1900 its population reached 20,000. In the 1860s, approximately 3,000 tons of rubber were being exported annually, and by 1911 annual exports had grown to 44,000 tons, representing 9.3% of Peru's exports.[46] During the rubber boom it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as typhus and malaria, killed 40,000 native Amazonians.[47]\n\n\nThe first direct foreign trade with Manaus commenced around 1874. Local trade along the river was carried on by the English successors to the Amazonas Company—the Amazon Steam Navigation Company—as well as numerous small steamboats, belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade, navigating the Negro, Madeira, Purús, and many other tributaries,[44] such as the Marañón, to ports as distant as Nauta, Peru.\n\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the exports of the Amazon basin were India-rubber, cacao beans, Brazil nuts and a few other products of minor importance, such as pelts and exotic forest produce (resins, barks, woven hammocks, prized bird feathers, live animals) and extracted goods, such as lumber and gold.\n\n\n\n### 20th-century development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Manaus, the largest city in Amazonas, as seen from a NASA satellite image, surrounded by the dark Rio Negro and the muddy Amazon River\n![](image)City of Manaus\n![](image)Floating houses in Leticia, Colombia\nSince colonial times, the Portuguese portion of the Amazon basin has remained a land largely undeveloped by agriculture and occupied by indigenous people who survived the arrival of European diseases.\n\n\nFour centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than 65 km2 (25 sq mi), excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters.[48] This situation changed dramatically during the 20th century.\n\n\nWary of foreign exploitation of the nation's resources, Brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior, away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land. The original architect of this expansion was president Getúlio Vargas, with the demand for rubber from the Allied forces in World War II providing funding for the drive.\n\n\nIn the 1960s, economic exploitation of the Amazon basin was seen as a way to fuel the \"economic miracle\" occurring at the time. This resulted in the development of \"Operation Amazon\", an economic development project that brought large-scale agriculture and ranching to Amazonia. This was done through a combination of credit and fiscal incentives.[49]\n\n\nHowever, in the 1970s the government took a new approach with the National Integration Program (PIN). A large-scale colonization program saw families from northeastern Brazil relocated to the \"land without people\" in the Amazon Basin. This was done in conjunction with infrastructure projects mainly the Trans-Amazonian Highway (*Transamazônica*).[49]\n\n\nThe Trans-Amazonian Highway's three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise. Large portions of the Trans-Amazonian and its accessory roads, such as BR-317 (Manaus-Porto Velho), are derelict and impassable in the rainy season. Small towns and villages are scattered across the forest, and because its vegetation is so dense, some remote areas are still unexplored.\n\n\nMany settlements grew along the road from Brasília to Belém with the highway and National Integration Program, however, the program failed as the settlers were unequipped to live in the delicate rainforest ecosystem. This, although the government believed it could sustain millions, instead could sustain very few.[50]\n\n\nWith a population of 1.9 million people in 2014, Manaus is the largest city on the Amazon. Manaus alone makes up approximately 50% of the population of the largest Brazilian state of Amazonas. The racial makeup of the city is 64% pardo (mulatto and mestizo) and 32% white.[51]\n\n\nAlthough the Amazon river remains undammed, around 412 dams are in operation in the Amazon's tributary rivers. From these 412 dams, 151 are constructed over six of the main tributary rivers that drain into the Amazon.[52] Since only 4% of the Amazon's hydropower potential has been developed in countries like Brazil,[53] more damming projects are underway and hundreds more are planned.[54] After witnessing the negative effects of environmental degradation, sedimentation, navigation and flood control caused by the Three Gorges Dam in the Yangtze River,[55] scientists are worried that constructing more dams in the Amazon will harm its biodiversity in the same way by \"blocking fish-spawning runs, reducing the flows of vital oil nutrients and clearing forests\".[54] Damming the Amazon River could potentially bring about the \"end of free flowing rivers\" and contribute to an \"ecosystem collapse\" that will cause major social and environmental problems.[52]\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Source of the Amazon River\n\n![](image)The Amazon was thought to originate from the Apacheta cliff in Arequipa at the Nevado Mismi, marked only by a wooden cross.\n![](image)Nevado Mismi, formerly considered to be the source of the Amazon\n![](image)Marañón River in Peru\nThe most distant source of the Amazon was thought to be in the Apurímac river drainage for nearly a century. Such studies continued to be published even recently, such as in 1996,[56] 2001,[57] 2007,[18] and 2008,[58] where various authors identified the snowcapped 5,597 m (18,363 ft) Nevado Mismi peak, located roughly 160 km (99 mi) west of Lake Titicaca and 700 km (430 mi) southeast of Lima, as the most distant source of the river. From that point, Quebrada Carhuasanta emerges from Nevado Mismi, joins Quebrada Apacheta and soon forms Río Lloqueta which becomes Río Hornillos and eventually joins the Río Apurímac.\n\n\nA 2014 study by Americans James Contos and Nicolas Tripcevich in *Area*, a peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Geographical Society, however, identifies the most distant source of the Amazon as actually being in the Río Mantaro drainage.[21] A variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the Mantaro river vs. the Apurímac river from their most distant source points to their confluence, showing the longer length of the Mantaro. Then distances from Lago Junín to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin). The most accurate measurement method was direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence (performed by Contos). Obtaining these measurements was difficult given the class IV–V nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80 km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apurímac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80 km longer than previously thought. Contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the Amazon river from its newly identified source (finishing November 2012), a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.[59]\n\n\nAfter about 700 km (430 mi), the Apurímac then joins Río Mantaro to form the Ene, which joins the Perene to form the Tambo, which joins the Urubamba River to form the Ucayali. After the confluence of Apurímac and Ucayali, the river leaves Andean terrain and is surrounded by floodplain. From this point to the confluence of the Ucayali and the Marañón, some 1,600 km (990 mi), the forested banks are just above the water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage.[44] The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills, and the river enters the enormous Amazon rainforest.\n\n\n\n### The Upper Amazon or Solimões[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon River near Iquitos, Peru\nAlthough the Ucayali–Marañón confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the Amazon River proper, in Brazil the river is known at this point as the *Solimões das Águas*. The river systems and flood plains in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, whose waters drain into the *Solimões* and its tributaries, are called the \"Upper Amazon\".\n\n\nThe Amazon proper runs mostly through Brazil and Peru, and is part of the border between Colombia and Perú. It has a series of major tributaries in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, some of which flow into the Marañón and Ucayali, and others directly into the Amazon proper. These include rivers Putumayo, Caquetá, Vaupés, Guainía, Morona, Pastaza, Nucuray, Urituyacu, Chambira, Tigre, Nanay, Napo, and Huallaga.\n\n\nAt some points, the river divides into anabranches, or multiple channels, often very long, with inland and lateral channels, all connected by a complicated system of natural canals, cutting the low, flat *igapó* lands, which are never more than 5 m (16 ft) above low river, into many islands.[60]\n\n\nFrom the town of Canaria at the great bend of the Amazon to the Negro, vast areas of land are submerged at high water, above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests appear. Near the mouth of the Rio Negro to Serpa, nearly opposite the river Madeira, the banks of the Amazon are low, until approaching Manaus, they rise to become rolling hills.[44]\n\n\n\n### The Lower Amazon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Meeting of Waters; the confluence of Rio Negro (blue) and Rio Solimões (sandy) near Manaus, Brazil\n![](image)Water samples of the Solimões (right) and Rio Negro (left)\nThe Lower Amazon begins where the darkly colored waters of the Rio Negro meets the sandy-colored Rio Solimões (the upper Amazon), and for over 6 km (3.7 mi) these waters run side by side without mixing. At Óbidos, a bluff 17 m (56 ft) above the river is backed by low hills. The lower Amazon seems to have once been a gulf of the Atlantic Ocean, the waters of which washed the cliffs near Óbidos.\n\n\nOnly about 10% of the Amazon's water enters downstream of Óbidos, very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley. The drainage area of the Amazon basin above Óbidos city is about 5,000,000 km2 (1,900,000 sq mi), and, below, only about 1,000,000 km2 (390,000 sq mi) (around 20%), exclusive of the 1,400,000 km2 (540,000 sq mi) of the Tocantins basin.[44] The Tocantins River enters the southern portion of the Amazon delta.\n\n\nIn the lower reaches of the river, the north bank consists of a series of steep, table-topped hills extending for about 240 km (150 mi) from opposite the mouth of the Xingu as far as Monte Alegre. These hills are cut down to a kind of terrace which lies between them and the river.[60]\n\n\nOn the south bank, above the Xingu, a line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to Santarém in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest, and, abutting upon the lower Tapajós, merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the Tapajós river valley.[61]\n\n\n\n### Mouth[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of the mouth of the Amazon River, from the north looking south\nBelém is the major city and port at the mouth of the river at the Atlantic Ocean. The definition of where exactly the mouth of the Amazon is located, and how wide it is, is a matter of dispute, because of the area's peculiar geography. The Pará and the Amazon are connected by a series of river channels called *furos* near the town of Breves; between them lies Marajó, the world's largest combined river/sea island.\n\n\nIf the Pará river and the Marajó island ocean frontage are included, the Amazon estuary is some 325 km (202 mi) wide.[62] In this case, the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo Norte, the cape located straight east of Pracuúba in the Brazilian state of Amapá, to Ponta da Tijoca near the town of Curuçá, in the state of Pará.\n\n\nA more conservative measurement excluding the Pará river estuary, from the mouth of the Araguari River to Ponta do Navio on the northern coast of Marajó, would still give the mouth of the Amazon a width of over 180 km (112 mi). If only the river's main channel is considered, between the islands of Curuá (state of Amapá) and Jurupari (state of Pará), the width falls to about 15 km (9.3 mi).\n\n\nThe plume generated by the river's discharge covers up to 1.3 million km2 and is responsible for muddy bottoms influencing a wide area of the tropical north Atlantic in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation.[23]\n\n\n\n### Lack of bridges[edit]\n\n\nThere are no bridges across the entire width of the river.[63] This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry. The Manaus Iranduba Bridge linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the Rio Negro, the second-largest tributary of the Amazon, just before their confluence.\n\n\n\n### Dispute regarding length[edit]\n\n\n![](image)River taxi in Peru\nSee also: Coastline paradox\n\nWhile debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest. However, the Amazon has been reported as being anywhere between 6,275 km (3,899 mi) and 6,992 km (4,345 mi) long.[3] It is often said to be \"at least\" 6,575 km (4,086 mi) long.[2] The Nile is reported to be anywhere from 5,499 to 7,088 km (3,417 to 4,404 mi).[3] Often it is said to be \"about\" 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long.[17] There are several factors that can affect these measurements, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n\n\nIn July 2008, the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE) published a news article on their webpage, claiming that the Amazon River was 140 km (87 mi) longer than the Nile. The Amazon's length was calculated as 6,992 km (4,345 mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853 km (4,258 mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of *Canal do Sul* and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Marajó and finally including the marine waters of the *Río Pará* bay in its entire length.[58][20] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800 km (4,200 mi) by a Brazilian scientist. In June 2007, Guido Gelli, director of science at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), told London's Telegraph Newspaper that it could be considered that the Amazon was the longest river in the world.[64] However, according to the above sources, none of the two results was published, and questions were raised about the researchers' methodology. In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of 7,088 km (4,404 mi) for the Nile and 6,575 km (4,086 mi) for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon basin\n\nThe Amazon basin, the largest in the world, covers about 40% of South America, an area of approximately 7,050,000 km2 (2,720,000 sq mi). It drains from west to east, from Iquitos in Peru, across Brazil to the Atlantic. It gathers its waters from 5 degrees north latitude to 20 degrees south latitude. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-Andean plateau, just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean.[65]\n\n\nThe Amazon River and its tributaries are characterised by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season. Every year, the river rises more than 9 m (30 ft), flooding the surrounding forests, known as *várzea* (\"flooded forests\"). The Amazon's flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world.[66] In an average dry season, 110,000 km2 (42,000 sq mi) of land are water-covered, while in the wet season, the flooded area of the Amazon basin rises to 350,000 km2 (140,000 sq mi).[62]\n\n\nThe quantity of water released by the Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean is enormous: up to 300,000 m3/s (11,000,000 cu ft/s) in the rainy season, with an average of 209,000 m3/s (7,400,000 cu ft/s) from 1973 to 1990.[67] The Amazon is responsible for about 20% of the Earth's fresh water entering the ocean.[66] The river pushes a vast plume of fresh water into the ocean. The plume is about 400 km (250 mi) long and between 100 and 200 km (62 and 124 mi) wide. The fresh water, being lighter, flows on top of the seawater, diluting the salinity and altering the colour of the ocean surface over an area up to 2,500,000 km2 (970,000 sq mi) in extent. For centuries ships have reported fresh water near the Amazon's mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean.[25]\n\n\nThe Atlantic has sufficient wave and tidal energy to carry most of the Amazon's sediments out to sea, thus the Amazon does not form a true delta. The great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water, while the Amazon empties directly into the turbulent Atlantic.[22]\n\n\nThere is a natural water union between the Amazon and the Orinoco basins, the so-called Casiquiare canal. The Casiquiare is a river distributary of the upper Orinoco, which flows southward into the Rio Negro, which in turn flows into the Amazon. The Casiquiare is the largest river on earth that links two major river systems, a so-called bifurcation.\n\n\n\n## Discharge[edit]\n\n\nAverage discharge at the estuary; Period from 2003 to 2015: 7,200 km3/a (230,000 m3/s)[68][69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n | Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2003\n | 6,470\n | 205,000\n | 2010\n | 6,464\n | 205,000\n |\n| 2004\n | 6,747\n | 214,000\n | 2011\n | 7,378\n | 234,000\n |\n| 2005\n | 6,522\n | 207,000\n | 2012\n | 7,513\n | 238,000\n |\n| 2006\n | 7,829\n | 248,000\n | 2013\n | 7,288\n | 231,000\n |\n| 2007\n | 7,133\n | 226,000\n | 2014\n | 7,674\n | 243,000\n |\n| 2008\n | 7,725\n | 245,000\n | 2015\n | 6,657\n | 211,000\n |\n| 2009\n | 8,200\n | 260,000\n |  |\n\n\nAverage discharge at Óbidos gauge station; Period from 1969 to 2018: 5,520 km3/a (175,000 m3/s)[68][69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n | Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1969\n | 4,813\n | 152,500\n | 1994\n | 6,184\n | 196,000\n |\n| 1970\n | 5,187\n | 164,400\n | 1995\n | 4,887\n | 154,900\n |\n| 1971\n | 5,810\n | 184,100\n | 1996\n | 5,685\n | 180,300\n |\n| 1972\n | 5,735\n | 181,700\n | 1997\n | 5,336\n | 169,200\n |\n| 1973\n | 5,723\n | 181,350\n | 1998\n | 4,713\n | 149,400\n |\n| 1974\n | 6,084\n | 192,800\n | 1999\n | 5,860\n | 185,100\n |\n| 1975\n | 6,122\n | 194,000\n | 2000\n | 5,735\n | 181,800\n |\n| 1976\n | 5,885\n | 186,500\n | 2001\n | 5,536\n | 175,500\n |\n| 1977\n | 5,561\n | 176,200\n | 2002\n | 5,598\n | 177,500\n |\n| 1978\n | 5,660\n | 179,400\n | 2003\n | 5,387\n | 170,800\n |\n| 1979\n | 5,350\n | 169,500\n | 2004\n | 5,207\n | 165,100\n |\n| 1980\n | 4,563\n | 144,600\n | 2005\n | 5,104\n | 161,800\n |\n| 1981\n | 4,838\n | 153,300\n | 2006\n | 5,825\n | 184,700\n |\n| 1982\n | 5,760\n | 182,500\n | 2007\n | 5,490\n | 174,100\n |\n| 1983\n | 4,538\n | 143,800\n | 2008\n | 6,090\n | 193,000\n |\n| 1984\n | 5,536\n | 175,400\n | 2009\n | 6,264\n | 198,500\n |\n| 1985\n | 5,187\n | 164,400\n | 2010\n | 5,233\n | 165,800\n |\n| 1986\n | 5,785\n | 183,300\n | 2011\n | 5,568\n | 176,400\n |\n| 1987\n | 5,261\n | 166,700\n | 2012\n | 5,877\n | 186,200\n |\n| 1988\n | 5,286\n | 167,500\n | 2013\n | 6,083\n | 192,800\n |\n| 1989\n | 6,284\n | 199,100\n | 2014\n | 6,212\n | 196,850\n |\n| 1990\n | 5,324\n | 168,700\n | 2015\n | 5,890\n | 186,650\n |\n| 1991\n | 5,424\n | 171,900\n | 2016\n | 5,025\n | 159,200\n |\n| 1992\n | 4,390\n | 139,100\n | 2017\n | 5,710\n | 180,900\n |\n| 1993\n | 5,710\n | 180,900\n | 2018\n | 5,685\n | 180,150\n |\n\n\nAverage discharge (Q - 173,000 m3/s) and sediment load (S - 754 x 106 ton/year) at Óbidos gauge station (period from 1996 to 2007)[70]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Q\n | S\n | Year\n | Q\n | S\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1996\n | 180,300\n | 672\n | 2002\n | 177,500\n | 802\n |\n| 1997\n | 169,200\n | 691\n | 2003\n | 170,800\n | 832\n |\n| 1998\n | 149,400\n | 652\n | 2004\n | 165,100\n | 807\n |\n| 1999\n | 185,800\n | 732\n | 2005\n | 161,800\n | 797\n |\n| 2000\n | 181,800\n | 692\n | 2006\n | 184,700\n | 742\n |\n| 2001\n | 175,500\n | 787\n | 2007\n | 174,100\n | 842\n |\n\n\nAverage, minimum and maximum discharge at Itacoatiara and Santarém (Lower Amazon).

Many branches begin flooding in November and might continue to rise until June. The rise of the Rio Negro starts in February or March and begins to recede in June. The Madeira River rises and falls two months earlier than most of the rest of the Amazon river.\n\n\nThe depth of the Amazon between Manacapuru and Óbidos has been calculated as between 20 and 26 m (66 and 85 ft). At Manacapuru, the Amazon's water level is only about 24 m (79 ft) above mean sea level. More than half of the water in the Amazon downstream of Manacapuru is below sea level.[74] In its lowermost section, the Amazon's depth averages 20 to 50 m (66 to 164 ft), in some places as much as 100 m (330 ft).[75]\n\n\nThe main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to Manaus, 1,500 km (930 mi) upriver from the mouth. Smaller ocean vessels below 9000 tons and with less than 5.5 m (18 ft) draft can reach as far as Iquitos, Peru, 3,600 km (2,200 mi) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780 km (480 mi) higher, as far as Achual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently ascend to the Pongo de Manseriche, just above Achual Point in Peru.[60]\n\n\nAnnual flooding occurs in late northern latitude winter at high tide when the incoming waters of the Atlantic are funnelled into the Amazon delta. The resulting undular tidal bore is called the *pororoca*, with a leading wave that can be up to 7.6 m (25 ft) high and travel up to 800 km (500 mi) inland.[76][77]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon River originated as a transcontinental river in the Miocene epoch between 11.8 million and 11.3 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 2.4 million years ago in the Early Pleistocene.\n\n\nThe proto-Amazon during the Cretaceous flowed west, as part of a proto-Amazon-Congo river system, from the interior of present-day Africa when the continents were connected, forming western Gondwana. 80 million years ago, the two continents split. Fifteen million years ago, the main tectonic uplift phase of the Andean chain started. This tectonic movement is caused by the subduction of the Nazca Plate underneath the South American Plate. The rise of the Andes and the linkage of the Brazilian and Guyana bedrock shields,[*clarification needed*] blocked the river and caused the Amazon Basin to become a vast inland sea. Gradually, this inland sea became a massive swampy, freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater.[78]\n\n\nEleven to ten million years ago, waters worked through the sandstone from the west and the Amazon began to flow eastward, leading to the emergence of the Amazon rainforest. During glacial periods, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river, which would eventually become the disputed world's longest, draining the most extensive area of rainforest on the planet.[79]\n\n\nParalleling the Amazon River is a large aquifer, dubbed the Hamza River, the discovery of which was made public in August 2011.[80]\n\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Country\n | Coordinates\n | Image\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve | Peru | 3°56′S 73°33′W﻿ / ﻿3.933°S 73.550°W﻿ / -3.933; -73.550 | ![](image) | [81]\n |\n| Amacayacu National Park | Colombia | 3°29′S 72°12′W﻿ / ﻿3.483°S 72.200°W﻿ / -3.483; -72.200 | ![](image) | [82]\n |\n| Amazônia National Park | Brazil | 4°26′S 56°50′W﻿ / ﻿4.433°S 56.833°W﻿ / -4.433; -56.833 | ![](image) | [83]\n |\n| Anavilhanas National Park | Brazil | 2°23′S 60°55′W﻿ / ﻿2.383°S 60.917°W﻿ / -2.383; -60.917 | ![](image) | [84]\n |\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Biodiversity of Colombia § Amazon natural region\n\n### Flora[edit]\n\n\nSee also the categories Flora of the Amazon and Trees of the Amazon rainforest\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The tambaqui, an important species in Amazonian fisheries, breeds in the Amazon River\nSee also: Category:Fauna of the Amazon\n\nMore than one-third of all known species in the world live in the Amazon rainforest.[85] It is the richest tropical forest in the world in terms of biodiversity.[86] In addition to thousands of species of fish, the river supports crabs, algae, and turtles.\n\n\n\n#### Mammals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon river dolphin\nAlong with the Orinoco, the Amazon is one of the main habitats of the *boto*, also known as the Amazon river dolphin (*Inia geoffrensis*). It is the largest species of river dolphin, and it can grow to lengths of up to 2.6 m (8.5 ft). The colour of its skin changes with age; young animals are gray, but become pink and then white as they mature. The dolphins use echolocation to navigate and hunt in the river's tricky depths.[87] The *boto* is the subject of a legend in Brazil about a dolphin that turns into a man and seduces maidens by the riverside.[88]\n\n\nThe tucuxi (*Sotalia fluviatilis*), also a dolphin species, is found both in the rivers of the Amazon basin and in the coastal waters of South America. The Amazonian manatee (*Trichechus inunguis*), also known as \"seacow\", is found in the northern Amazon River basin and its tributaries. It is a mammal and a herbivore. Its population is limited to freshwater habitats, and, unlike other manatees, it does not venture into saltwater. It is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[89]\n\n\nThe Amazon and its tributaries are the main habitat of the giant otter (*Pteronura brasiliensis*).[90] Sometimes known as the \"river wolf,\" it is one of South America's top carnivores. Because of habitat destruction and hunting, its population has dramatically decreased. It is now listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which effectively bans international trade.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Reptiles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Green anaconda is the heaviest and one of the longest known extant snake species\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

One of the world's largest species of snake, the anaconda spends most of its time in the water with just its nostrils above the surface. Species of caimans, that are related to alligators and other crocodilians, also inhabit the Amazon as do varieties of turtles.[92]\n\n\n\n#### Birds[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Birds of the Amazon rainforest\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(February 2017)*\n |\n\n\n#### Fish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Characins, such as the piranha species, are prey for the giant otter, but these aggressive fish may also pose a danger to humans.\n![](image)Neon tetra is one of the most popular aquarium fish\nThe Amazonian fish fauna is the centre of diversity for neotropical fishes, some of which are popular aquarium specimens like the neon tetra and the freshwater angelfish. More than 5,600 species were known as of 2011[update], and approximately fifty new species are discovered each year.[93][94] The arapaima, known in Brazil as the *pirarucu*, is a South American tropical freshwater fish, one of the largest freshwater fish in the world, with a length of up to 15 feet (4.6 m).[95] Another Amazonian freshwater fish is the arowana (or *aruanã* in Portuguese), such as the silver arowana (*Osteoglossum bicirrhosum*), which is a predator and very similar to the arapaima, but only reaches a length of 120 cm (47 in). Also present in large numbers is the notorious piranha, an omnivorous fish that congregates in large schools and may attack livestock. There are approximately 30 to 60 species of piranha. The candirú, native to the Amazon River, is a species of parasitic fresh water catfish in the family Trichomycteridae,[96] just one of more than 1200 species of catfish in the Amazon basin. Other catfish 'walk' overland on their ventral fins,[97] while the kumakuma (*Brachyplatystoma filamentosum*), aka *piraiba* or \"goliath catfish\", can reach 3.6 m (12 ft) in length and 200 kg (440 lb) in weight.[98]\n\n\nThe electric eel (*Electrophorus electricus*) and more than 100 species of electric fishes (Gymnotiformes) inhabit the Amazon basin. River stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) are also known. The bull shark (*Carcharhinus leucas*) has been reported 4,000 km (2,500 mi) up the Amazon River at Iquitos in Peru.[99]\n\n\n\n#### Butterflies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of butterflies of the Amazon River basin and the Andes\n\n#### Microbiota[edit]\n\n\nFreshwater microbes are generally not very well known, even less so for a pristine ecosystem like the Amazon. Recently, metagenomics has provided answers to what kind of microbes inhabit the river.[100] The most important microbes in the Amazon River are Actinomycetota, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Thermoproteota.\n\n\n\n## Challenges[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon River, servas a vital lifeline for more than 47 million people in its basin, faces a multitude of challenges that threaten both its ecosystem and the indigenous communities dependent on its resources. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Yanomami, a tribe of approximately 29,000, struggles to preserve their land, culture, and traditional way of life due to encroaching illegal gold miners, malnutrition, and malaria. Meanwhile, the region's severe drought, has led to a devastating increase in water temperatures, reaching 39.1 degrees Celsius, causing the tragic demise of 125 Amazon river dolphins.[101] This unfortunate event serves as a poignant marker of the deteriorating environmental conditions, indicating the increasing vulnerability of the river's ecosystem. Amazon River has experienced historically low water levels, the lowest in over a century. Brazil, the primary custodian of this invaluable natural resource, grapples with the challenges of mitigating the effects of this drought on communities and ecosystems, further emphasizing the urgency of sustainable environmental management and conservation efforts.

and 7,025 km (3,899 and 4,365 mi).[3]\nThe length measurements of many rivers are only approximations and differ from each other because there are many factors that determine the calculated river length, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n2. **^** The Nile is usually said to be the longest river in the world, with a length of about 6,650 km,[17] and the Amazon the second longest river in the world, with a length of at least 6,400 km.[2] In 2007 and 2008, some scientists claimed that the Amazon has a length of 6,992 km and was longer than the Nile, whose length was calculated as 6,853 km.[18][19] They achieved this result by adding the waterway from the Amazon's southern outlet through tidal canals and the Pará estuary of the Tocantins.[*citation needed*]\nA peer-reviewed article, published in 2009, states a length of 7,088 km for the Nile and 6,575 km for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica, as of 2020, the length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Amazon River at GEOnet Names Server\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c***

Brazilians call this section the Solimões River above its confluence with the Rio Negro[22] forming what Brazilians call the Amazon at the Meeting of Waters (Portuguese: *Encontro das Águas*) at Manaus, the largest city on the river.\n\n\nThe Amazon River has an average discharge of about 215,000–230,000 m3/s (7,600,000–8,100,000 cu ft/s)—approximately 6,591–7,570 km3 (1,581–1,816 cu mi) per year, greater than the next seven largest independent rivers combined. Two of the top ten rivers by discharge are tributaries of the Amazon river. The Amazon represents 20% of the global riverine discharge into oceans.[23] The Amazon basin is the largest drainage basin in the world, with an area of approximately 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi).[2] The portion of the river's drainage basin in Brazil alone is larger than any other river's basin. The Amazon enters Brazil with only one-fifth of the flow it finally discharges into the Atlantic Ocean, yet already has a greater flow at this point than the discharge of any other river.[24][25]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon was initially known by Europeans as the Marañón, and the Peruvian part of the river is still known by that name today. It later became known as Rio Amazonas in Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n\nThe name Rio Amazonas was reportedly given after native warriors attacked a 16th-century expedition by Francisco de Orellana. The warriors were led by women, reminding de Orellana of the Amazon warriors, a tribe of women warriors related to Iranian Scythians and Sarmatians[26][27] mentioned in Greek mythology.\nThe word Amazon itself may be derived from the Iranian compound \\* ha-maz-an- \"(one) fighting together\"[28] or ethnonym *\\* ha-mazan-* \"warriors\", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in Hesychius of Alexandria's gloss \"ἁμαζακάραν· πολεμεῖν. Πέρσαι\" (\"**hamazakaran**: 'to make war' in Persian\"), where it appears together with the Indo-Iranian root *\\* kar-* \"make\" (from which Sanskrit *karma* is also derived).[29]\n\n\nOther scholars[*who?*] claim that the name is derived from the Tupi word *amassona*, meaning \"boat destroyer\".[30]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Timeline of Amazon history\n\n### Geological history[edit]\n\n\nRecent geological studies suggest that for millions of years the Amazon River used to flow in the opposite direction - from east to west. Eventually the Andes Mountains formed, blocking its flow to the Pacific Ocean, and causing it to switch directions to its current mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.[31]\n\n\n\n### Pre-Columbian era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old drawing (from 1879) of Arapaima fishing at the Amazon river. The arapaima has been on Earth for at least 23 million years.[32]\nDuring what many archaeologists called the *formative stage*, Amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of South America's highland agrarian systems. The trade with Andean civilizations in the terrains of the headwaters in the Andes formed an essential contribution to the social and religious development of higher-altitude civilizations like the Muisca and Incas. Early human settlements were typically based on low-lying hills or mounds.\n\n\nShell mounds were the earliest evidence of habitation; they represent piles of human refuse (waste) and are mainly dated between 7500 BC and 4000 BC. They are associated with ceramic age cultures; no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists.[33] Artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds. They are best represented by the Marajoara culture. Figurative mounds are the most recent types of occupation.\n\n\nThere is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed towns and cities.[34] Archaeologists estimate that by the time the Spanish conquistador De Orellana traveled across the Amazon in 1541, more than 3 million indigenous people lived around the Amazon.[35] These pre-Columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations. For instance, pre-Columbian indigenous people on the island of Marajó may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people. To achieve this level of development, the indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest altered the forest's ecology by selective cultivation and the use of fire. Scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repeatedly, the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients. This created dark soil areas known as *terra preta de índio* (\"Indian dark earth\").[36] Because of the terra preta, indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures. Further research has hypothesized that this practice began around 11,000 years ago. Some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the Amazon basin.[36]\n\n\nMany indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. According to James S. Olson, \"The Munduruku expansion (in the 18th century) dislocated and displaced the Kawahíb, breaking the tribe down into much smaller groups ... [Munduruku] first came to the attention of Europeans in 1770 when they began a series of widespread attacks on Brazilian settlements along the Amazon River.\"[37]\n\n\n\n### Arrival of Europeans[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon tributaries near Manaus\nIn March 1500, Spanish conquistador Vicente Yáñez Pinzón was the first documented European to sail up the Amazon River.[38] Pinzón called the stream *Río Santa María del Mar Dulce*, later shortened to *Mar Dulce*, literally, *sweet sea*, because of its freshwater pushing out into the ocean. Another Spanish explorer, Francisco de Orellana, was the first European to travel from the origins of the upstream river basins, situated in the Andes, to the mouth of the river. In this journey, Orellana baptized some of the affluents of the Amazonas like Rio Negro, Napo and Jurua.\nThe name Amazonas is thought to be taken from the native warriors that attacked this expedition, mostly women, that reminded De Orellana of the mythical female Amazon warriors from the ancient Hellenic culture in Greece (see also Origin of the name).\n\n\n\n### Exploration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Fritz's 1707 map showing the Amazon and the Orinoco\nGonzalo Pizarro set off in 1541 to explore east of Quito into the South American interior in search of *El Dorado*, the \"city of gold\" and La Canela, the \"valley of cinnamon\".[39] He was accompanied by his second-in-command Francisco de Orellana. After 170 km (106 mi), the Coca River joined the Napo River (at a point now known as Puerto Francisco de Orellana); the party stopped for a few weeks to build a boat just upriver from this confluence. They continued downriver through an uninhabited area, where they could not find food. Orellana offered and was ordered to follow the Napo River, then known as *Río de la Canela* (\"Cinnamon River\"), and return with food for the party. Based on intelligence received from a captive native chief named Delicola, they expected to find food within a few days downriver by ascending another river to the north.\n\n\nDe Orellana took about 57 men, the boat, and some canoes and left Pizarro's troops on 26 December 1541. However, De Orellana missed the confluence (probably with the Aguarico) where he was searching supplies for his men. By the time he and his men reached another village, many of them were sick from hunger and eating \"noxious plants\", and near death. Seven men died in that village. His men threatened to mutiny if the expedition turned back to attempt to rejoin Pizarro, the party being over 100 leagues downstream at this point. He accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of Spain, and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream. After a journey of 600 km (370 mi) down the Napo River, they reached a further major confluence, at a point near modern Iquitos, and then followed the upper Amazon, now known as the Solimões, for a further 1,200 km (746 mi) to its confluence with the Rio Negro (near modern Manaus), which they reached on 3 June 1542.\n\n\nRegarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon, Pizarro reported to the king that they had found cinnamon trees, but that they could not be profitably harvested. True cinnamon (*Cinnamomum Verum*) is not native to South America. Other related cinnamon-containing plants (of the family *Lauraceae*) are fairly common in that part of the Amazon and Pizarro probably saw some of these. The expedition reached the mouth of the Amazon on 24 August 1542, demonstrating the practical navigability of the Great River.\n\n\n\n![](image)Masked-dance, and wedding-feast of Ticuna Indians, engravings for Bates's 1863 *The Naturalist on the River Amazons*\nIn 1560, another Spanish conquistador, Lope de Aguirre, may have made the second descent of the Amazon. Historians are uncertain whether the river he descended was the Amazon or the Orinoco River, which runs more or less parallel to the Amazon further north.\n\n\nPortuguese explorer Pedro Teixeira was the first European to travel up the entire river. He arrived in Quito in 1637, and returned via the same route.[40]\n\n\nFrom 1648 to 1652, Portuguese Brazilian *bandeirante* António Raposo Tavares led an expedition from São Paulo overland to the mouth of the Amazon, investigating many of its tributaries, including the Rio Negro, and covering a distance of over 10,000 km (6,200 mi).\n\n\nIn what is currently in Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, several colonial and religious settlements were established along the banks of primary rivers and tributaries for trade, slaving, and evangelization among the indigenous peoples of the vast rainforest, such as the Urarina. In the late 1600s, Czech Jesuit Father Samuel Fritz, an apostle of the Omagus established some forty mission villages. Fritz proposed that the Marañón River must be the source of the Amazon, noting on his 1707 map that the Marañón \"has its source on the southern shore of a lake that is called Lauricocha, near Huánuco.\" Fritz reasoned that the Marañón is the largest river branch one encounters when journeying upstream, and lies farther to the west than any other tributary of the Amazon. For most of the 18th–19th centuries and into the 20th century, the Marañón was generally considered the source of the Amazon.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Henry Walter Bates was most famous for his expedition to the Amazon (1848–1859).\n### Scientific exploration[edit]\n\n\nEarly scientific, zoological, and botanical exploration of the Amazon River and basin took place from the 18th century through the first half of the 19th century.\n\n\n\n* Charles Marie de La Condamine explored the river in 1743.[42]\n* Alexander von Humboldt, 1799–1804\n* Johann Baptist von Spix and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius, 1817–1820\n* Georg von Langsdorff, 1826–1828\n* Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace, 1848–1859\n* Richard Spruce, 1849–1864\n\n\n### Post-colonial exploitation and settlement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazonas state\n![Amazon Theatre opera house in Manaus built in 1896 during the rubber boom](image)\nAmazon Theatre opera house in Manaus built in 1896 during the rubber boom\n![Metropolitan Cathedral of Santarém, in Santarém, Brazil](image)\nMetropolitan Cathedral of Santarém, in Santarém, Brazil\n\n![](image)Iglesia Matriz in Iquitos, Peru\nThe Cabanagem revolt (1835–1840) was directed against the white ruling class. It is estimated that from 30% to 40% of the population of Grão-Pará, estimated at 100,000 people, died.[43]\n\n\nThe population of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon basin in 1850 was perhaps 300,000, of whom about 175,000 were Europeans and 25,000 were slaves. The Brazilian Amazon's principal commercial city, Pará (now Belém), had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, including slaves. The town of Manáos, now Manaus, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had a population between 1,000 and 1,500. All the remaining villages, as far up as Tabatinga, on the Brazilian frontier of Peru, were relatively small.[44]\n\n\nOn 6 September 1850, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the Amazon and gave the Viscount of Mauá (Irineu Evangelista de Sousa) the task of putting it into effect. He organised the \"Companhia de Navegação e Comércio do Amazonas\" in Rio de Janeiro in 1852; in the following year it commenced operations with four small steamers, the *Monarca* ('Monarch'), the *Cametá*, the *Marajó* and the *Rio Negro*.[44][45]\n\n\nAt first, navigation was principally confined to the main river; and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between Pará and Manaus, with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity, a second line to make six round voyages a year between Manaus and Tabatinga, and a third, two trips a month between Pará and Cametá.[44] This was the first step in opening up the vast interior.\n\n\nThe success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the Amazon, and a second company soon opened commerce on the Madeira, Purús, and Negro; a third established a line between Pará and Manaus, and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams. In that same period, the Amazonas Company was increasing its fleet. Meanwhile, private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries.[44]\n\n\nOn 31 July 1867, the government of Brazil, constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the upper Amazon basin, especially Peru, decreed the opening of the Amazon to all countries, but they limited this to certain defined points: Tabatinga – on the Amazon; Cametá – on the Tocantins; Santarém – on the Tapajós; Borba – on the Madeira, and Manaus – on the Rio Negro. The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867.[44]\n\n\nThanks in part to the mercantile development associated with steamboat navigation coupled with the internationally driven demand for natural rubber, the Peruvian city of Iquitos became a thriving, cosmopolitan center of commerce. Foreign companies settled in Iquitos, from where they controlled the extraction of rubber. In 1851 Iquitos had a population of 200, and by 1900 its population reached 20,000. In the 1860s, approximately 3,000 tons of rubber were being exported annually, and by 1911 annual exports had grown to 44,000 tons, representing 9.3% of Peru's exports.[46] During the rubber boom it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as typhus and malaria, killed 40,000 native Amazonians.[47]\n\n\nThe first direct foreign trade with Manaus commenced around 1874. Local trade along the river was carried on by the English successors to the Amazonas Company—the Amazon Steam Navigation Company—as well as numerous small steamboats, belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade, navigating the Negro, Madeira, Purús, and many other tributaries,[44] such as the Marañón, to ports as distant as Nauta, Peru.\n\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the exports of the Amazon basin were India-rubber, cacao beans, Brazil nuts and a few other products of minor importance, such as pelts and exotic forest produce (resins, barks, woven hammocks, prized bird feathers, live animals) and extracted goods, such as lumber and gold.\n\n\n\n### 20th-century development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Manaus, the largest city in Amazonas, as seen from a NASA satellite image, surrounded by the dark Rio Negro and the muddy Amazon River\n![](image)City of Manaus\n![](image)Floating houses in Leticia, Colombia\nSince colonial times, the Portuguese portion of the Amazon basin has remained a land largely undeveloped by agriculture and occupied by indigenous people who survived the arrival of European diseases.\n\n\nFour centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than 65 km2 (25 sq mi), excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters.[48] This situation changed dramatically during the 20th century.\n\n\nWary of foreign exploitation of the nation's resources, Brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior, away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land. The original architect of this expansion was president Getúlio Vargas, with the demand for rubber from the Allied forces in World War II providing funding for the drive.\n\n\nIn the 1960s, economic exploitation of the Amazon basin was seen as a way to fuel the \"economic miracle\" occurring at the time. This resulted in the development of \"Operation Amazon\", an economic development project that brought large-scale agriculture and ranching to Amazonia. This was done through a combination of credit and fiscal incentives.[49]\n\n\nHowever, in the 1970s the government took a new approach with the National Integration Program (PIN). A large-scale colonization program saw families from northeastern Brazil relocated to the \"land without people\" in the Amazon Basin. This was done in conjunction with infrastructure projects mainly the Trans-Amazonian Highway (*Transamazônica*).[49]\n\n\nThe Trans-Amazonian Highway's three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise. Large portions of the Trans-Amazonian and its accessory roads, such as BR-317 (Manaus-Porto Velho), are derelict and impassable in the rainy season. Small towns and villages are scattered across the forest, and because its vegetation is so dense, some remote areas are still unexplored.\n\n\nMany settlements grew along the road from Brasília to Belém with the highway and National Integration Program, however, the program failed as the settlers were unequipped to live in the delicate rainforest ecosystem. This, although the government believed it could sustain millions, instead could sustain very few.[50]\n\n\nWith a population of 1.9 million people in 2014, Manaus is the largest city on the Amazon. Manaus alone makes up approximately 50% of the population of the largest Brazilian state of Amazonas. The racial makeup of the city is 64% pardo (mulatto and mestizo) and 32% white.[51]\n\n\nAlthough the Amazon river remains undammed, around 412 dams are in operation in the Amazon's tributary rivers. From these 412 dams, 151 are constructed over six of the main tributary rivers that drain into the Amazon.[52] Since only 4% of the Amazon's hydropower potential has been developed in countries like Brazil,[53] more damming projects are underway and hundreds more are planned.[54] After witnessing the negative effects of environmental degradation, sedimentation, navigation and flood control caused by the Three Gorges Dam in the Yangtze River,[55] scientists are worried that constructing more dams in the Amazon will harm its biodiversity in the same way by \"blocking fish-spawning runs, reducing the flows of vital oil nutrients and clearing forests\".[54] Damming the Amazon River could potentially bring about the \"end of free flowing rivers\" and contribute to an \"ecosystem collapse\" that will cause major social and environmental problems.[52]\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Source of the Amazon River\n\n![](image)The Amazon was thought to originate from the Apacheta cliff in Arequipa at the Nevado Mismi, marked only by a wooden cross.\n![](image)Nevado Mismi, formerly considered to be the source of the Amazon\n![](image)Marañón River in Peru\nThe most distant source of the Amazon was thought to be in the Apurímac river drainage for nearly a century. Such studies continued to be published even recently, such as in 1996,[56] 2001,[57] 2007,[18] and 2008,[58] where various authors identified the snowcapped 5,597 m (18,363 ft) Nevado Mismi peak, located roughly 160 km (99 mi) west of Lake Titicaca and 700 km (430 mi) southeast of Lima, as the most distant source of the river. From that point, Quebrada Carhuasanta emerges from Nevado Mismi, joins Quebrada Apacheta and soon forms Río Lloqueta which becomes Río Hornillos and eventually joins the Río Apurímac.\n\n\nA 2014 study by Americans James Contos and Nicolas Tripcevich in *Area*, a peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Geographical Society, however, identifies the most distant source of the Amazon as actually being in the Río Mantaro drainage.[21] A variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the Mantaro river vs. the Apurímac river from their most distant source points to their confluence, showing the longer length of the Mantaro. Then distances from Lago Junín to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin). The most accurate measurement method was direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence (performed by Contos). Obtaining these measurements was difficult given the class IV–V nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80 km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apurímac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80 km longer than previously thought. Contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the Amazon river from its newly identified source (finishing November 2012), a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.[59]\n\n\nAfter about 700 km (430 mi), the Apurímac then joins Río Mantaro to form the Ene, which joins the Perene to form the Tambo, which joins the Urubamba River to form the Ucayali. After the confluence of Apurímac and Ucayali, the river leaves Andean terrain and is surrounded by floodplain. From this point to the confluence of the Ucayali and the Marañón, some 1,600 km (990 mi), the forested banks are just above the water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage.[44] The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills, and the river enters the enormous Amazon rainforest.\n\n\n\n### The Upper Amazon or Solimões[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon River near Iquitos, Peru\nAlthough the Ucayali–Marañón confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the Amazon River proper, in Brazil the river is known at this point as the *Solimões das Águas*. The river systems and flood plains in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, whose waters drain into the *Solimões* and its tributaries, are called the \"Upper Amazon\".\n\n\nThe Amazon proper runs mostly through Brazil and Peru, and is part of the border between Colombia and Perú. It has a series of major tributaries in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, some of which flow into the Marañón and Ucayali, and others directly into the Amazon proper. These include rivers Putumayo, Caquetá, Vaupés, Guainía, Morona, Pastaza, Nucuray, Urituyacu, Chambira, Tigre, Nanay, Napo, and Huallaga.\n\n\nAt some points, the river divides into anabranches, or multiple channels, often very long, with inland and lateral channels, all connected by a complicated system of natural canals, cutting the low, flat *igapó* lands, which are never more than 5 m (16 ft) above low river, into many islands.[60]\n\n\nFrom the town of Canaria at the great bend of the Amazon to the Negro, vast areas of land are submerged at high water, above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests appear. Near the mouth of the Rio Negro to Serpa, nearly opposite the river Madeira, the banks of the Amazon are low, until approaching Manaus, they rise to become rolling hills.[44]\n\n\n\n### The Lower Amazon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Meeting of Waters; the confluence of Rio Negro (blue) and Rio Solimões (sandy) near Manaus, Brazil\n![](image)Water samples of the Solimões (right) and Rio Negro (left)\nThe Lower Amazon begins where the darkly colored waters of the Rio Negro meets the sandy-colored Rio Solimões (the upper Amazon), and for over 6 km (3.7 mi) these waters run side by side without mixing. At Óbidos, a bluff 17 m (56 ft) above the river is backed by low hills. The lower Amazon seems to have once been a gulf of the Atlantic Ocean, the waters of which washed the cliffs near Óbidos.\n\n\nOnly about 10% of the Amazon's water enters downstream of Óbidos, very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley. The drainage area of the Amazon basin above Óbidos city is about 5,000,000 km2 (1,900,000 sq mi), and, below, only about 1,000,000 km2 (390,000 sq mi) (around 20%), exclusive of the 1,400,000 km2 (540,000 sq mi) of the Tocantins basin.[44] The Tocantins River enters the southern portion of the Amazon delta.\n\n\nIn the lower reaches of the river, the north bank consists of a series of steep, table-topped hills extending for about 240 km (150 mi) from opposite the mouth of the Xingu as far as Monte Alegre. These hills are cut down to a kind of terrace which lies between them and the river.[60]\n\n\nOn the south bank, above the Xingu, a line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to Santarém in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest, and, abutting upon the lower Tapajós, merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the Tapajós river valley.[61]\n\n\n\n### Mouth[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of the mouth of the Amazon River, from the north looking south\nBelém is the major city and port at the mouth of the river at the Atlantic Ocean. The definition of where exactly the mouth of the Amazon is located, and how wide it is, is a matter of dispute, because of the area's peculiar geography. The Pará and the Amazon are connected by a series of river channels called *furos* near the town of Breves; between them lies Marajó, the world's largest combined river/sea island.\n\n\nIf the Pará river and the Marajó island ocean frontage are included, the Amazon estuary is some 325 km (202 mi) wide.[62] In this case, the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo Norte, the cape located straight east of Pracuúba in the Brazilian state of Amapá, to Ponta da Tijoca near the town of Curuçá, in the state of Pará.\n\n\nA more conservative measurement excluding the Pará river estuary, from the mouth of the Araguari River to Ponta do Navio on the northern coast of Marajó, would still give the mouth of the Amazon a width of over 180 km (112 mi). If only the river's main channel is considered, between the islands of Curuá (state of Amapá) and Jurupari (state of Pará), the width falls to about 15 km (9.3 mi).\n\n\nThe plume generated by the river's discharge covers up to 1.3 million km2 and is responsible for muddy bottoms influencing a wide area of the tropical north Atlantic in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation.[23]\n\n\n\n### Lack of bridges[edit]\n\n\nThere are no bridges across the entire width of the river.[63] This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry. The Manaus Iranduba Bridge linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the Rio Negro, the second-largest tributary of the Amazon, just before their confluence.\n\n\n\n### Dispute regarding length[edit]\n\n\n![](image)River taxi in Peru\nSee also: Coastline paradox\n\nWhile debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest. However, the Amazon has been reported as being anywhere between 6,275 km (3,899 mi) and 6,992 km (4,345 mi) long.[3] It is often said to be \"at least\" 6,575 km (4,086 mi) long.[2] The Nile is reported to be anywhere from 5,499 to 7,088 km (3,417 to 4,404 mi).[3] Often it is said to be \"about\" 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long.[17] There are several factors that can affect these measurements, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n\n\nIn July 2008, the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE) published a news article on their webpage, claiming that the Amazon River was 140 km (87 mi) longer than the Nile. The Amazon's length was calculated as 6,992 km (4,345 mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853 km (4,258 mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of *Canal do Sul* and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Marajó and finally including the marine waters of the *Río Pará* bay in its entire length.[58][20] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800 km (4,200 mi) by a Brazilian scientist. In June 2007, Guido Gelli, director of science at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), told London's Telegraph Newspaper that it could be considered that the Amazon was the longest river in the world.[64] However, according to the above sources, none of the two results was published, and questions were raised about the researchers' methodology. In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of 7,088 km (4,404 mi) for the Nile and 6,575 km (4,086 mi) for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon basin\n\nThe Amazon basin, the largest in the world, covers about 40% of South America, an area of approximately 7,050,000 km2 (2,720,000 sq mi). It drains from west to east, from Iquitos in Peru, across Brazil to the Atlantic. It gathers its waters from 5 degrees north latitude to 20 degrees south latitude. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-Andean plateau, just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean.[65]\n\n\nThe Amazon River and its tributaries are characterised by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season. Every year, the river rises more than 9 m (30 ft), flooding the surrounding forests, known as *várzea* (\"flooded forests\"). The Amazon's flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world.[66] In an average dry season, 110,000 km2 (42,000 sq mi) of land are water-covered, while in the wet season, the flooded area of the Amazon basin rises to 350,000 km2 (140,000 sq mi).[62]\n\n\nThe quantity of water released by the Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean is enormous: up to 300,000 m3/s (11,000,000 cu ft/s) in the rainy season, with an average of 209,000 m3/s (7,400,000 cu ft/s) from 1973 to 1990.[67] The Amazon is responsible for about 20% of the Earth's fresh water entering the ocean.[66] The river pushes a vast plume of fresh water into the ocean. The plume is about 400 km (250 mi) long and between 100 and 200 km (62 and 124 mi) wide. The fresh water, being lighter, flows on top of the seawater, diluting the salinity and altering the colour of the ocean surface over an area up to 2,500,000 km2 (970,000 sq mi) in extent. For centuries ships have reported fresh water near the Amazon's mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean.[25]\n\n\nThe Atlantic has sufficient wave and tidal energy to carry most of the Amazon's sediments out to sea, thus the Amazon does not form a true delta. The great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water, while the Amazon empties directly into the turbulent Atlantic.[22]\n\n\nThere is a natural water union between the Amazon and the Orinoco basins, the so-called Casiquiare canal. The Casiquiare is a river distributary of the upper Orinoco, which flows southward into the Rio Negro, which in turn flows into the Amazon. The Casiquiare is the largest river on earth that links two major river systems, a so-called bifurcation.\n\n\n\n## Discharge[edit]\n\n\nAverage discharge at the estuary; Period from 2003 to 2015: 7,200 km3/a (230,000 m3/s)[68][69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n | Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2003\n | 6,470\n | 205,000\n | 2010\n | 6,464\n | 205,000\n |\n| 2004\n | 6,747\n | 214,000\n | 2011\n | 7,378\n | 234,000\n |\n| 2005\n | 6,522\n | 207,000\n | 2012\n | 7,513\n | 238,000\n |\n| 2006\n | 7,829\n | 248,000\n | 2013\n | 7,288\n | 231,000\n |\n| 2007\n | 7,133\n | 226,000\n | 2014\n | 7,674\n | 243,000\n |\n| 2008\n | 7,725\n | 245,000\n | 2015\n | 6,657\n | 211,000\n |\n| 2009\n | 8,200\n | 260,000\n |  |\n\n\nAverage discharge at Óbidos gauge station; Period from 1969 to 2018: 5,520 km3/a (175,000 m3/s)[68][69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n | Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1969\n | 4,813\n | 152,500\n | 1994\n | 6,184\n | 196,000\n |\n| 1970\n | 5,187\n | 164,400\n | 1995\n | 4,887\n | 154,900\n |\n| 1971\n | 5,810\n | 184,100\n | 1996\n | 5,685\n | 180,300\n |\n| 1972\n | 5,735\n | 181,700\n | 1997\n | 5,336\n | 169,200\n |\n| 1973\n | 5,723\n | 181,350\n | 1998\n | 4,713\n | 149,400\n |\n| 1974\n | 6,084\n | 192,800\n | 1999\n | 5,860\n | 185,100\n |\n| 1975\n | 6,122\n | 194,000\n | 2000\n | 5,735\n | 181,800\n |\n| 1976\n | 5,885\n | 186,500\n | 2001\n | 5,536\n | 175,500\n |\n| 1977\n | 5,561\n | 176,200\n | 2002\n | 5,598\n | 177,500\n |\n| 1978\n | 5,660\n | 179,400\n | 2003\n | 5,387\n | 170,800\n |\n| 1979\n | 5,350\n | 169,500\n | 2004\n | 5,207\n | 165,100\n |\n| 1980\n | 4,563\n | 144,600\n | 2005\n | 5,104\n | 161,800\n |\n| 1981\n | 4,838\n | 153,300\n | 2006\n | 5,825\n | 184,700\n |\n| 1982\n | 5,760\n | 182,500\n | 2007\n | 5,490\n | 174,100\n |\n| 1983\n | 4,538\n | 143,800\n | 2008\n | 6,090\n | 193,000\n |\n| 1984\n | 5,536\n | 175,400\n | 2009\n | 6,264\n | 198,500\n |\n| 1985\n | 5,187\n | 164,400\n | 2010\n | 5,233\n | 165,800\n |\n| 1986\n | 5,785\n | 183,300\n | 2011\n | 5,568\n | 176,400\n |\n| 1987\n | 5,261\n | 166,700\n | 2012\n | 5,877\n | 186,200\n |\n| 1988\n | 5,286\n | 167,500\n | 2013\n | 6,083\n | 192,800\n |\n| 1989\n | 6,284\n | 199,100\n | 2014\n | 6,212\n | 196,850\n |\n| 1990\n | 5,324\n | 168,700\n | 2015\n | 5,890\n | 186,650\n |\n| 1991\n | 5,424\n | 171,900\n | 2016\n | 5,025\n | 159,200\n |\n| 1992\n | 4,390\n | 139,100\n | 2017\n | 5,710\n | 180,900\n |\n| 1993\n | 5,710\n | 180,900\n | 2018\n | 5,685\n | 180,150\n |\n\n\nAverage discharge (Q - 173,000 m3/s) and sediment load (S - 754 x 106 ton/year) at Óbidos gauge station (period from 1996 to 2007)[70]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Q\n | S\n | Year\n | Q\n | S\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1996\n | 180,300\n | 672\n | 2002\n | 177,500\n | 802\n |\n| 1997\n | 169,200\n | 691\n | 2003\n | 170,800\n | 832\n |\n| 1998\n | 149,400\n | 652\n | 2004\n | 165,100\n | 807\n |\n| 1999\n | 185,800\n | 732\n | 2005\n | 161,800\n | 797\n |\n| 2000\n | 181,800\n | 692\n | 2006\n | 184,700\n | 742\n |\n| 2001\n | 175,500\n | 787\n | 2007\n | 174,100\n | 842\n |\n\n\nAverage, minimum and maximum discharge at Itacoatiara and Santarém (Lower Amazon).

Many branches begin flooding in November and might continue to rise until June. The rise of the Rio Negro starts in February or March and begins to recede in June. The Madeira River rises and falls two months earlier than most of the rest of the Amazon river.\n\n\nThe depth of the Amazon between Manacapuru and Óbidos has been calculated as between 20 and 26 m (66 and 85 ft). At Manacapuru, the Amazon's water level is only about 24 m (79 ft) above mean sea level. More than half of the water in the Amazon downstream of Manacapuru is below sea level.[74] In its lowermost section, the Amazon's depth averages 20 to 50 m (66 to 164 ft), in some places as much as 100 m (330 ft).[75]\n\n\nThe main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to Manaus, 1,500 km (930 mi) upriver from the mouth. Smaller ocean vessels below 9000 tons and with less than 5.5 m (18 ft) draft can reach as far as Iquitos, Peru, 3,600 km (2,200 mi) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780 km (480 mi) higher, as far as Achual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently ascend to the Pongo de Manseriche, just above Achual Point in Peru.[60]\n\n\nAnnual flooding occurs in late northern latitude winter at high tide when the incoming waters of the Atlantic are funnelled into the Amazon delta. The resulting undular tidal bore is called the *pororoca*, with a leading wave that can be up to 7.6 m (25 ft) high and travel up to 800 km (500 mi) inland.[76][77]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon River originated as a transcontinental river in the Miocene epoch between 11.8 million and 11.3 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 2.4 million years ago in the Early Pleistocene.\n\n\nThe proto-Amazon during the Cretaceous flowed west, as part of a proto-Amazon-Congo river system, from the interior of present-day Africa when the continents were connected, forming western Gondwana. 80 million years ago, the two continents split. Fifteen million years ago, the main tectonic uplift phase of the Andean chain started. This tectonic movement is caused by the subduction of the Nazca Plate underneath the South American Plate. The rise of the Andes and the linkage of the Brazilian and Guyana bedrock shields,[*clarification needed*] blocked the river and caused the Amazon Basin to become a vast inland sea. Gradually, this inland sea became a massive swampy, freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater.[78]\n\n\nEleven to ten million years ago, waters worked through the sandstone from the west and the Amazon began to flow eastward, leading to the emergence of the Amazon rainforest. During glacial periods, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river, which would eventually become the disputed world's longest, draining the most extensive area of rainforest on the planet.[79]\n\n\nParalleling the Amazon River is a large aquifer, dubbed the Hamza River, the discovery of which was made public in August 2011.[80]\n\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Country\n | Coordinates\n | Image\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve | Peru | 3°56′S 73°33′W﻿ / ﻿3.933°S 73.550°W﻿ / -3.933; -73.550 | ![](image) | [81]\n |\n| Amacayacu National Park | Colombia | 3°29′S 72°12′W﻿ / ﻿3.483°S 72.200°W﻿ / -3.483; -72.200 | ![](image) | [82]\n |\n| Amazônia National Park | Brazil | 4°26′S 56°50′W﻿ / ﻿4.433°S 56.833°W﻿ / -4.433; -56.833 | ![](image) | [83]\n |\n| Anavilhanas National Park | Brazil | 2°23′S 60°55′W﻿ / ﻿2.383°S 60.917°W﻿ / -2.383; -60.917 | ![](image) | [84]\n |\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Biodiversity of Colombia § Amazon natural region\n\n### Flora[edit]\n\n\nSee also the categories Flora of the Amazon and Trees of the Amazon rainforest\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The tambaqui, an important species in Amazonian fisheries, breeds in the Amazon River\nSee also: Category:Fauna of the Amazon\n\nMore than one-third of all known species in the world live in the Amazon rainforest.[85] It is the richest tropical forest in the world in terms of biodiversity.[86] In addition to thousands of species of fish, the river supports crabs, algae, and turtles.\n\n\n\n#### Mammals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon river dolphin\nAlong with the Orinoco, the Amazon is one of the main habitats of the *boto*, also known as the Amazon river dolphin (*Inia geoffrensis*). It is the largest species of river dolphin, and it can grow to lengths of up to 2.6 m (8.5 ft). The colour of its skin changes with age; young animals are gray, but become pink and then white as they mature. The dolphins use echolocation to navigate and hunt in the river's tricky depths.[87] The *boto* is the subject of a legend in Brazil about a dolphin that turns into a man and seduces maidens by the riverside.[88]\n\n\nThe tucuxi (*Sotalia fluviatilis*), also a dolphin species, is found both in the rivers of the Amazon basin and in the coastal waters of South America. The Amazonian manatee (*Trichechus inunguis*), also known as \"seacow\", is found in the northern Amazon River basin and its tributaries. It is a mammal and a herbivore. Its population is limited to freshwater habitats, and, unlike other manatees, it does not venture into saltwater. It is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[89]\n\n\nThe Amazon and its tributaries are the main habitat of the giant otter (*Pteronura brasiliensis*).[90] Sometimes known as the \"river wolf,\" it is one of South America's top carnivores. Because of habitat destruction and hunting, its population has dramatically decreased. It is now listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which effectively bans international trade.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Reptiles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Green anaconda is the heaviest and one of the longest known extant snake species\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

One of the world's largest species of snake, the anaconda spends most of its time in the water with just its nostrils above the surface. Species of caimans, that are related to alligators and other crocodilians, also inhabit the Amazon as do varieties of turtles.[92]\n\n\n\n#### Birds[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Birds of the Amazon rainforest\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(February 2017)*\n |\n\n\n#### Fish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Characins, such as the piranha species, are prey for the giant otter, but these aggressive fish may also pose a danger to humans.\n![](image)Neon tetra is one of the most popular aquarium fish\nThe Amazonian fish fauna is the centre of diversity for neotropical fishes, some of which are popular aquarium specimens like the neon tetra and the freshwater angelfish. More than 5,600 species were known as of 2011[update], and approximately fifty new species are discovered each year.[93][94] The arapaima, known in Brazil as the *pirarucu*, is a South American tropical freshwater fish, one of the largest freshwater fish in the world, with a length of up to 15 feet (4.6 m).[95] Another Amazonian freshwater fish is the arowana (or *aruanã* in Portuguese), such as the silver arowana (*Osteoglossum bicirrhosum*), which is a predator and very similar to the arapaima, but only reaches a length of 120 cm (47 in). Also present in large numbers is the notorious piranha, an omnivorous fish that congregates in large schools and may attack livestock. There are approximately 30 to 60 species of piranha. The candirú, native to the Amazon River, is a species of parasitic fresh water catfish in the family Trichomycteridae,[96] just one of more than 1200 species of catfish in the Amazon basin. Other catfish 'walk' overland on their ventral fins,[97] while the kumakuma (*Brachyplatystoma filamentosum*), aka *piraiba* or \"goliath catfish\", can reach 3.6 m (12 ft) in length and 200 kg (440 lb) in weight.[98]\n\n\nThe electric eel (*Electrophorus electricus*) and more than 100 species of electric fishes (Gymnotiformes) inhabit the Amazon basin. River stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) are also known. The bull shark (*Carcharhinus leucas*) has been reported 4,000 km (2,500 mi) up the Amazon River at Iquitos in Peru.[99]\n\n\n\n#### Butterflies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of butterflies of the Amazon River basin and the Andes\n\n#### Microbiota[edit]\n\n\nFreshwater microbes are generally not very well known, even less so for a pristine ecosystem like the Amazon. Recently, metagenomics has provided answers to what kind of microbes inhabit the river.[100] The most important microbes in the Amazon River are Actinomycetota, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Thermoproteota.\n\n\n\n## Challenges[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon River, servas a vital lifeline for more than 47 million people in its basin, faces a multitude of challenges that threaten both its ecosystem and the indigenous communities dependent on its resources. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Yanomami, a tribe of approximately 29,000, struggles to preserve their land, culture, and traditional way of life due to encroaching illegal gold miners, malnutrition, and malaria. Meanwhile, the region's severe drought, has led to a devastating increase in water temperatures, reaching 39.1 degrees Celsius, causing the tragic demise of 125 Amazon river dolphins.[101] This unfortunate event serves as a poignant marker of the deteriorating environmental conditions, indicating the increasing vulnerability of the river's ecosystem. Amazon River has experienced historically low water levels, the lowest in over a century. Brazil, the primary custodian of this invaluable natural resource, grapples with the challenges of mitigating the effects of this drought on communities and ecosystems, further emphasizing the urgency of sustainable environmental management and conservation efforts. [102]\n\n\n\n## Major tributaries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Solimões, the section of the upper Amazon River\n![](image)Aerial view of an Amazon tributary\nThe Amazon has over 1,100 tributaries, twelve of

and 7,025 km (3,899 and 4,365 mi).[3]\nThe length measurements of many rivers are only approximations and differ from each other because there are many factors that determine the calculated river length, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n2. **^** The Nile is usually said to be the longest river in the world, with a length of about 6,650 km,[17] and the Amazon the second longest river in the world, with a length of at least 6,400 km.[2] In 2007 and 2008, some scientists claimed that the Amazon has a length of 6,992 km and was longer than the Nile, whose length was calculated as 6,853 km.[18][19] They achieved this result by adding the waterway from the Amazon's southern outlet through tidal canals and the Pará estuary of the Tocantins.[*citation needed*]\nA peer-reviewed article, published in 2009, states a length of 7,088 km for the Nile and 6,575 km for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica, as of 2020, the length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Amazon River at GEOnet Names Server\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c***

With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains.[17] The main stem is entirely within the United States; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi (2,980,000 km2), of which only about one percent is in Canada. The Mississippi ranks as the thirteenth-largest river by discharge in the world. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.[18][19]\n\n\nNative Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years. Most were hunter-gatherers, but some, such as the Mound Builders, formed prolific agricultural and urban civilizations. The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers, then settlers, ventured into the basin in increasing numbers.[20] The river served first as a barrier, forming borders for New Spain, New France, and the early United States, and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link. In the 19th century, during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny, the Mississippi and several western tributaries, most notably the Missouri, formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States.\n\n\nFormed from thick layers of the river's silt deposits, the Mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile regions of the United States; steamboats were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to ship agricultural and industrial goods. During the American Civil War, the Mississippi's capture by Union forces marked a turning point towards victory, due to the river's strategic importance to the Confederate war effort. Because of the substantial growth of cities and the larger ships and barges that replaced steamboats, the first decades of the 20th century saw the construction of massive engineering works such as levees, locks and dams, often built in combination. A major focus of this work has been to prevent the lower Mississippi from shifting into the channel of the Atchafalaya River and bypassing New Orleans.\n\n\nSince the 20th century, the Mississippi River has also experienced major pollution and environmental problems — most notably elevated nutrient and chemical levels from agricultural runoff, the primary contributor to the Gulf of Mexico dead zone.\n\n\n\n\n## Name and significance[edit]\n\n\nThe word Mississippi itself comes from *Misi zipi*, the French rendering of the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe or Algonquin) name for the river, *Misi-ziibi* (Great River).[21]\n\n\nIn the 18th century, the river was set by the Treaty of Paris as, for the most part, the western border of the new United States. With the Louisiana Purchase and the country's westward expansion, it became a convenient boundary line between the western and eastern halves of the country.[22][23] This is reflected in the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, which was designed to symbolize the opening of the West,[24] and the focus on the \"Trans-Mississippi\" region in the Trans-Mississippi Exposition.[25]\n\n\nRegional landmarks are often classified in relation to the river, such as \"the highest peak east of the Mississippi\"[26] or \"the oldest city west of the Mississippi\".[27] The FCC also uses it as the dividing line for broadcast call-signs, which begin with W to the east and K to the west, overlapping in media markets along the river.\n\n\n\n## Divisions[edit]\n\n\nThe Mississippi River can be divided into three sections: the Upper Mississippi, the river from its headwaters to the confluence with the Missouri River; the Middle Mississippi, which is downriver from the Missouri to the Ohio River; and the Lower Mississippi, which flows from the Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n\n### Upper Mississippi[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Upper Mississippi River\n\n![](image)The source of the Mississippi River at Lake Itasca\n![A log bridge over a very small river on an autumnal, cloudy day with flurries of snow](image)The first bridge (and only log bridge) over the Mississippi, about 25 feet south of its source at Lake Itasca\n![St. Anthony Falls](image)Former head of navigation, St. Anthony Falls, Minneapolis, Minnesota\n![](image)Confluence of the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers, viewed from Wyalusing State Park in Wisconsin\nThe Upper Mississippi runs from its headwaters to its confluence with the Missouri River at St. Louis, Missouri. It is divided into two sections:\n\n\n\n1. The headwaters, 493 miles (793 km) from the source to Saint Anthony Falls in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and\n2. A navigable channel, formed by a series of man-made lakes between Minneapolis and St. Louis, Missouri, some 664 miles (1,069 km).\n\n\nBarge on Upper Mississippi North of Lock and Dam No. 8\nThe source of the Upper Mississippi branch is traditionally accepted as Lake Itasca, 1,475 feet (450 m) above sea level in Itasca State Park in Clearwater County, Minnesota. The name *Itasca* was chosen to designate the \"true head\" of the Mississippi River as a combination of the last four letters of the Latin word for truth (*ver**itas***) and the first two letters of the Latin word for head (***ca**put*).[28] However, the lake is in turn fed by a number of smaller streams.\n\n\nFrom its origin at Lake Itasca to St. Louis, Missouri, the waterway's flow is moderated by 43 dams. Fourteen of these dams are located above Minneapolis in the headwaters region and serve multiple purposes, including power generation and recreation. The remaining 29 dams, beginning in downtown Minneapolis, all contain locks and were constructed to improve commercial navigation of the upper river. Taken as a whole, these 43 dams significantly shape the geography and influence the ecology of the upper river. Beginning just below Saint Paul, Minnesota, and continuing throughout the upper and lower river, the Mississippi is further controlled by thousands of wing dikes that moderate the river's flow in order to maintain an open navigation channel and prevent the river from eroding its banks.\n\n\nThe head of navigation on the Mississippi is the St. Anthony Falls Lock.[29] Before the Coon Rapids Dam in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, was built in 1913, steamboats could occasionally go upstream as far as Saint Cloud, Minnesota, depending on river conditions.\n\n\nThe uppermost lock and dam on the Upper Mississippi River is the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam in Minneapolis. Above the dam, the river's elevation is 799 feet (244 m). Below the dam, the river's elevation is 750 feet (230 m). This 49-foot (15 m) drop is the largest of all the Mississippi River locks and dams. The origin of the dramatic drop is a waterfall preserved adjacent to the lock under an apron of concrete. Saint Anthony Falls is the only true waterfall on the entire Mississippi River. The water elevation continues to drop steeply as it passes through the gorge carved by the waterfall.\n\n\nAfter the completion of the St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam in 1963, the river's head of navigation moved upstream, to the Coon Rapids Dam. However, the Locks were closed in 2015 to control the spread of invasive Asian carp, making Minneapolis once again the site of the head of navigation of the river.[29]\n\n\nThe Upper Mississippi has a number of natural and artificial lakes, with its widest point being Lake Winnibigoshish, near Grand Rapids, Minnesota, over 11 miles (18 km) across. Lake Onalaska, created by Lock and Dam No. 7, near La Crosse, Wisconsin, is more than 4 miles (6.4 km) wide. Lake Pepin, a natural lake formed behind the delta of the Chippewa River of Wisconsin as it enters the Upper Mississippi, is more than 2 miles (3.2 km) wide.[30]\n\n\nBy the time the Upper Mississippi reaches Saint Paul, Minnesota, below Lock and Dam No. 1, it has dropped more than half its original elevation and is 687 feet (209 m) above sea level. From St. Paul to St. Louis, Missouri, the river elevation falls much more slowly and is controlled and managed as a series of pools created by 26 locks and dams.[31]\n\n\nThe Upper Mississippi River is joined by the Minnesota River at Fort Snelling in the Twin Cities; the St. Croix River near Prescott, Wisconsin; the Cannon River near Red Wing, Minnesota; the Zumbro River at Wabasha, Minnesota; the Black, La Crosse, and Root rivers in La Crosse, Wisconsin; the Wisconsin River at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin; the Rock River at the Quad Cities; the Iowa River near Wapello, Iowa; the Skunk River south of Burlington, Iowa; and the Des Moines River at Keokuk, Iowa. Other major tributaries of the Upper Mississippi include the Crow River in Minnesota, the Chippewa River in Wisconsin, the Maquoketa River and the Wapsipinicon River in Iowa, and the Illinois River in Illinois.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Upper Mississippi River at its confluence with the Missouri River north of St. Louis\nThe Upper Mississippi is largely a multi-thread stream with many bars and islands. From its confluence with the St. Croix River downstream to Dubuque, Iowa, the river is entrenched, with high bedrock bluffs lying on either side. The height of these bluffs decreases to the south of Dubuque, though they are still significant through Savanna, Illinois. This topography contrasts strongly with the Lower Mississippi, which is a meandering river in a broad, flat area, only rarely flowing alongside a bluff (as at Vicksburg, Mississippi).\n\n\n\n![](image)The confluence of the Mississippi (left) and Ohio (right) rivers at Cairo, Illinois, the demarcation between the Middle and the Lower Mississippi River\n### Middle Mississippi[edit]\n\n\nThe Mississippi River is known as the Middle Mississippi from the Upper Mississippi River's confluence with the Missouri River at St. Louis, Missouri, for 190 miles (310 km) to its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois.[32][33]\n\n\nThe Middle Mississippi is relatively free-flowing. From St. Louis to the Ohio River confluence, the Middle Mississippi falls 220 feet (67 m) over 180 miles (290 km) for an average rate of 1.2 feet per mile (23 cm/km). At its confluence with the Ohio River, the Middle Mississippi is 315 feet (96 m) above sea level. Apart from the Missouri and Meramec rivers of Missouri and the Kaskaskia River of Illinois, no major tributaries enter the Middle Mississippi River.\n\n\n\n### Lower Mississippi[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lower Mississippi River\n\n![](image)Lower Mississippi River at Algiers Point in New Orleans\nThe Mississippi River is called the Lower Mississippi River from its confluence with the Ohio River to its mouth at the Gulf of Mexico, a distance of about 1,000 miles (1,600 km). At the confluence of the Ohio and the Middle Mississippi, the long-term mean discharge of the Ohio at Cairo, Illinois is 281,500 cubic feet per second (7,970 cubic meters per second),[34] while the long-term mean discharge of the Mississippi at Thebes, Illinois (just upriver from Cairo) is 208,200 cu ft/s (5,900 m3/s).[35] Thus, by volume, the main branch of the Mississippi River system at Cairo can be considered to be the Ohio River (and the Allegheny River further upstream), rather than the Middle Mississippi.\n\n\nIn addition to the Ohio River, the major tributaries of the Lower Mississippi River are the White River, flowing in at the White River National Wildlife Refuge in east-central Arkansas; the Arkansas River, joining the Mississippi at Arkansas Post; the Big Black River in Mississippi; and the Yazoo River, meeting the Mississippi at Vicksburg, Mississippi.\n\n\nDeliberate water diversion at the Old River Control Structure in Louisiana allows the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana to be a major distributary of the Mississippi River, with 30% of the combined flow of the Mississippi and Red Rivers flowing to the Gulf of Mexico by this route, rather than continuing down the Mississippi's current channel past Baton Rouge and New Orleans on a longer route to the Gulf.[36][37][38][39] Although the Red River was once an additional tributary, its water now flows separately into the Gulf of Mexico through the Atchafalaya River.[40]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the Mississippi River watershed\nAn animation of the flows along the rivers of the Mississippi watershed\nSee also: List of drainage basins by area\n\nThe Mississippi River has the world's fourth-largest drainage basin (\"watershed\" or \"catchment\"). The basin covers more than 1,245,000 square miles (3,220,000 km2), including all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. The drainage basin empties into the Gulf of Mexico, part of the Atlantic Ocean. The total catchment of the Mississippi River covers nearly 40% of the landmass of the continental United States. The highest point within the watershed is also the highest point of the Rocky Mountains, Mount Elbert at 14,440 feet (4,400 m).[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sequence of NASA MODIS images showing the outflow of fresh water from the Mississippi (arrows) into the Gulf of Mexico (2004)\nIn the United States, the Mississippi River drains the majority of the area between the crest of the Rocky Mountains and the crest of the Appalachian Mountains, except for various regions drained to Hudson Bay by the Red River of the North; to the Atlantic Ocean by the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River; and to the Gulf of Mexico by the Rio Grande, the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers, the Chattahoochee and Appalachicola rivers, and various smaller coastal waterways along the Gulf.\n\n\nThe Mississippi River empties into the Gulf of Mexico about 100 miles (160 km) downstream from New Orleans. Measurements of the length of the Mississippi from Lake Itasca to the Gulf of Mexico vary somewhat, but the United States Geological Survey's number is 2,340 miles (3,766 km). The retention time from Lake Itasca to the Gulf is typically about 90 days;[42] while speed varies along the course of the river, this gives an overall average of around 26 mi (42 km) per day, or 1 mi (1.6 km) per hour.\n\n\nThe stream gradient of the entire river is 0.01%, a drop of 450 m over 3,766 km.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Outflow[edit]\n\n\nThe Mississippi River discharges at an annual average rate of between 200 and 700 thousand cubic feet per second (6,000 and 20,000 m3/s).[43] The Mississippi is the fourteenth largest river in the world by volume. On average, the Mississippi has 8% the flow of the Amazon River,[44]\nwhich moves nearly 7 million cubic feet per second (200,000 m3/s) during wet seasons.\n\n\nBefore 1900, the Mississippi River transported an estimated 440 million short tons (400 million metric tons) of sediment per year from the interior of the United States to coastal Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico. During the last two decades, this number was only 160 million short tons (145 million metric tons) per year. The reduction in sediment transported down the Mississippi River is the result of engineering modification of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio rivers and their tributaries by dams, meander cutoffs, river-training structures, and bank revetments and soil erosion control programs in the areas drained by them.[45]\n\n\n\n### Mixing with salt water[edit]\n\n\nDenser salt water from the Gulf of Mexico forms a salt wedge along the river bottom near the mouth of the river, while fresh water flows near the surface. In drought years, with less fresh water to push it out, salt water can travel many miles upstream—64 miles (103 km) in 2022—contaminating drinking water supplies and requiring the use of desalination. The United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed \"saltwater sills\" or \"underwater levees\" to contain this in 1988, 1999, 2012, and 2022. This consists of a large mound of sand spanning the width of the river 55 feet below the surface, allowing fresh water and large cargo ships to pass over.[46]\n\n\nFresh river water flowing from the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico does not mix into the salt water immediately. The images from NASA's MODIS show a large plume of fresh water, which appears as a dark ribbon against the lighter-blue surrounding waters. These images demonstrate that the plume did not mix with the surrounding sea water immediately. Instead, it stayed intact as it flowed through the Gulf of Mexico, into the Straits of Florida, and entered the Gulf Stream. The Mississippi River water rounded the tip of Florida and traveled up the southeast coast to the latitude of Georgia before finally mixing in so thoroughly with the ocean that it could no longer be detected by MODIS.\n\n\n\n## Course changes[edit]\n\n\nOver geologic time, the Mississippi River has experienced numerous large and small changes to its main course, as well as additions, deletions, and other changes among its numerous tributaries, and the lower Mississippi River has used different pathways as its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico across the delta region.\n\n\nAs Pangaea began to break up about 95 million years ago, North America passed over a volcanic \"hotspot\" in the Earth's mantle (specifically, the Bermuda hotspot) that was undergoing a period of intense activity. The upwelling of magma from the hotspot forced the further uplift to a height of perhaps 2–3 km of part of the Appalachian-Ouachita range, forming an arch that blocked southbound water flows. The uplifted land quickly eroded and, as North America moved away from the hot spot and as the hotspot's activity declined, the crust beneath the embayment region cooled, contracted and subsided to a depth of 2.6 km, and around 80 million years ago the Reelfoot Rift formed a trough that was flooded by the Gulf of Mexico. As sea levels dropped, the Mississippi and other rivers extended their courses into the embayment, which gradually became filled with sediment with the Mississippi River at its center.[47][48]\n\n\nThrough a natural process known as avulsion or delta switching, the lower Mississippi River has shifted its final course to the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico every thousand years or so. This occurs because the deposits of silt and sediment begin to clog its channel, raising the river's level and causing it to eventually find a steeper, more direct route to the Gulf of Mexico. The abandoned distributaries diminish in volume and form what are known as bayous. This process has, over the past 5,000 years, caused the coastline of south Louisiana to advance toward the Gulf from 15 to 50 miles (24 to 80 km). The currently active delta lobe is called the Birdfoot Delta, after its shape, or the Balize Delta, after La Balize, Louisiana, the first French settlement at the mouth of the Mississippi.\n\n\n\n### Prehistoric courses[edit]\n\n\nThe current form of the Mississippi River basin was largely shaped by the Laurentide Ice Sheet of the most recent Ice Age. The southernmost extent of this enormous glaciation extended well into the present-day United States and Mississippi basin. When the ice sheet began to recede, hundreds of feet of rich sediment were deposited, creating the flat and fertile landscape of the Mississippi Valley. During the melt, giant glacial rivers found drainage paths into the Mississippi watershed, creating such features as the Minnesota River, James River, and Milk River valleys. When the ice sheet completely retreated, many of these \"temporary\" rivers found paths to Hudson Bay or the Arctic Ocean, leaving the Mississippi Basin with many features \"over-sized\" for the existing rivers to have carved in the same time period.\n\n\nIce sheets during the Illinoian Stage, about 300,000 to 132,000 years before present, blocked the Mississippi near Rock Island, Illinois, diverting it to its present channel farther to the west, the current western border of Illinois. The Hennepin Canal roughly follows the ancient channel of the Mississippi downstream from Rock Island to Hennepin, Illinois. South of Hennepin, to Alton, Illinois, the current Illinois River follows the ancient channel used by the Mississippi River before the Illinoian Stage.[49][50]\n\n\n\n![](image)View along the former riverbed at the Tennessee/Arkansas state line near Reverie, Tennessee (2007)\nTimeline of outflow course changes[51]\n\n\n\n* c. 5000 BC: The last ice age ended; world sea level became what it is now.\n* c. 2500 BC: Bayou Teche became the main course of the Mississippi.\n* c. 800 BC: The Mississippi diverted further east.\n* c. 200 AD: Bayou Lafourche became the main course of the Mississippi.\n* c. 1000 AD: The Mississippi's present course took over.\n* Before c. 1400 AD: The Red River of the South flowed parallel to the lower Mississippi to the sea\n* 15th century: Turnbull's Bend in the lower Mississippi extended so far west that it captured the Red River of the South.

The Atchafalaya started to capture the Mississippi and to become its new main lower course.\n* 1963: The Old River Control Structure was completed, controlling how much Mississippi water entered the Atchafalaya.\n\n\n### Historic course changes[edit]\n\n\nIn March 1876, the Mississippi suddenly changed course near the settlement of Reverie, Tennessee, leaving a small part of Tipton County, Tennessee, attached to Arkansas and separated from the rest of Tennessee by the new river channel. Since this event was an avulsion, rather than the effect of incremental erosion and deposition, the state line still follows the old channel.[52]\n\n\nThe town of Kaskaskia, Illinois once stood on a peninsula at the confluence of the Mississippi and Kaskaskia (Okaw) Rivers. Founded as a French colonial community, it later became the capital of the Illinois Territory and was the first state capital of Illinois until 1819. Beginning in 1844, successive flooding caused the Mississippi River to slowly encroach east. A major flood in 1881 caused it to overtake the lower 10 miles (16 km) of the Kaskaskia River, forming a new Mississippi channel and cutting off the town from the rest of the state. Later flooding destroyed most of the remaining town, including the original State House. Today, the remaining 2,300 acres (930 ha) island and community of 14 residents is known as an enclave of Illinois and is accessible only from the Missouri side.[53]\n\n\n\n### New Madrid Seismic Zone[edit]\n\n\nThe New Madrid Seismic Zone, along the Mississippi River near New Madrid, Missouri, between Memphis and St. Louis, is related to an aulacogen (failed rift) that formed at the same time as the Gulf of Mexico. This area is still quite active seismically. Four great earthquakes in 1811 and 1812, estimated at 8 on the Richter magnitude scale, had tremendous local effects in the then sparsely settled area, and were felt in many other places in the Midwestern and eastern U.S. These earthquakes created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee from the altered landscape near the river.\n\n\n\n## Length[edit]\n\n\nWhen measured from its traditional source at Lake Itasca, the Mississippi has a length of 2,340 miles (3,766 km). When measured from its longest stream source (most distant source from the sea), Brower's Spring in Montana, the source of the Missouri River, it has a length of 3,710 miles (5,971 km), making it the fourth longest river in the world after the Nile, Amazon, and Yangtze.[54] When measured by the largest stream source (by water volume), the Ohio River, by extension the Allegheny River, would be the source, and the Mississippi would begin in Pennsylvania.[55]\n\n\n\n## Depth[edit]\n\n\nAt its source at Lake Itasca, the Mississippi River is about 3 feet (0.91 m) deep. The average depth of the Mississippi River between Saint Paul and Saint Louis is between 9 and 12 feet (2.7–3.7 m) deep, the deepest part being Lake Pepin, which averages 20–32 feet (6–10 m) deep and has a maximum depth of 60 feet (18 m). Between where the Missouri River joins the Mississippi at Saint Louis, Missouri, and Cairo, Illinois, the depth averages 30 feet (9 m). Below Cairo, where the Ohio River joins, the depth averages 50–100 feet (15–30 m) deep. The deepest part of the river is in New Orleans, where it reaches 200 feet (61 m) deep.[56][57]\n\n\n\n## Cultural geography[edit]\n\n\n### State boundaries[edit]\n\n\nThe Mississippi River runs through or along 10 states, from Minnesota to Louisiana, and is used to define portions of these states borders, with Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi along the east side of the river, and Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansas along its west side. Substantial parts of both Minnesota and Louisiana are on either side of the river, although the Mississippi defines part of the boundary of each of these states.\n\n\nIn all of these cases, the middle of the riverbed at the time the borders were established was used as the line to define the borders between adjacent states.[58][59] In various areas, the river has since shifted, but the state borders have not changed, still following the former bed of the Mississippi River as of their establishment, leaving several small isolated areas of one state across the new river channel, contiguous with the adjacent state. Also, due to a meander in the river, a small part of western Kentucky is contiguous with Tennessee but isolated from the rest of its state.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nLake Pepin, the widest naturally occurring part of the Mississippi, is part of the Minnesota–Wisconsin border.\n\n![](image)\nThe Mississippi River in downtown Baton Rouge\n\n### Communities along the river[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Metro Area\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Minneapolis–Saint Paul | 3,946,533\n |\n| St. Louis | 2,916,447\n |\n| Memphis | 1,316,100\n |\n| New Orleans | 1,214,932\n |\n| Baton Rouge | 802,484\n |\n| Quad Cities, IA-IL | 387,630\n |\n| St. Cloud, MN | 189,148\n |\n| La Crosse, WI | 133,365\n |\n| Cape Girardeau–Jackson MO-IL | 96,275\n |\n| Dubuque, IA | 93,653\n |\n\n\n![](image)In Minnesota, the Mississippi River runs through the Twin Cities (2007)\n![](image)Community of boathouses on the Mississippi River in Winona, MN (2006)\n![](image)The Mississippi River at the Chain of Rocks just north of St. Louis (2005)\n![](image)A low-water dam deepens the pool above the Chain of Rocks Lock near St. Louis (2006)\nMany of the communities along the Mississippi River are listed below; most have either historic significance or cultural lore connecting them to the river.

It spanned the river in Minneapolis where the current Hennepin Avenue Bridge is located.[61] No highway or railroad tunnels cross under the Mississippi River.\n\n\nThe first railroad bridge across the Mississippi was built in 1856. It spanned the river between the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois and Davenport, Iowa. Steamboat captains of the day, fearful of competition from the railroads, considered the new bridge a hazard to navigation. Two weeks after the bridge opened, the steamboat *Effie Afton* rammed part of the bridge, setting it on fire. Legal proceedings ensued, with Abraham Lincoln defending the railroad. The lawsuit went to the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled in favor of the railroad.[62]\n\n\nBelow is a general overview of selected Mississippi bridges that have notable engineering or landmark significance, with their cities or locations.

The task of maintaining a navigation channel is the responsibility of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which was established in 1802.[65] Earlier projects began as early as 1829 to remove snags, close off secondary channels and excavate rocks and sandbars.\n\n\n\n![](image)Oil tanker on the Lower Mississippi near the Port of New Orleans\n![](image)Barge on the Lower Mississippi River\nA series of 29 locks and dams on the upper Mississippi, most of which were built in the 1930s, is designed primarily to maintain a 9-foot-deep (2.7 m) channel for commercial barge traffic.[66][67] The lakes formed are also used for recreational boating and fishing. The dams make the river deeper and wider but do not stop it. No flood control is intended. During periods of high flow, the gates, some of which are submersible, are completely opened and the dams simply cease to function. Below St. Louis, the Mississippi is relatively free-flowing, although it is constrained by numerous levees and directed by numerous wing dams. The scope and scale of the levees, built along either side of the river to keep it on its course, has often been compared to the Great Wall of China.[36]\n\n\nOn the lower Mississippi, from Baton Rouge to the mouth of the Mississippi, the navigation depth is 45 feet (14 m), allowing container ships and cruise ships to dock at the Port of New Orleans and bulk cargo ships shorter than 150-foot (46 m) air draft that fit under the Huey P. Long Bridge to traverse the Mississippi to Baton Rouge.[68] There is a feasibility study to dredge this portion of the river to 50 feet (15 m) to allow New Panamax ship depths.[69]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lock and Dam No. 11, north of Dubuque, Iowa (2007)\nIn 1829, there were surveys of the two major obstacles on the upper Mississippi, the Des Moines Rapids and the Rock Island Rapids, where the river was shallow and the riverbed was rock. The Des Moines Rapids were about 11 miles (18 km) long and just above the mouth of the Des Moines River at Keokuk, Iowa. The Rock Island Rapids were between Rock Island and Moline, Illinois. Both rapids were considered virtually impassable.\n\n\nIn 1848, the Illinois and Michigan Canal was built to connect the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan via the Illinois River near Peru, Illinois. The canal allowed shipping between these important waterways. In 1900, the canal was replaced by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. The second canal, in addition to shipping, also allowed Chicago to address specific health issues (typhoid fever, cholera and other waterborne diseases) by sending its waste down the Illinois and Mississippi river systems rather than polluting its water source of Lake Michigan.\n\n\nThe Corps of Engineers recommended the excavation of a 5-foot-deep (1.5 m) channel at the Des Moines Rapids, but work did not begin until after Lieutenant Robert E. Lee endorsed the project in 1837. The Corps later also began excavating the Rock Island Rapids. By 1866, it had become evident that excavation was impractical, and it was decided to build a canal around the Des Moines Rapids. The canal opened in 1877, but the Rock Island Rapids remained an obstacle. In 1878, Congress authorized the Corps to establish a 4.5-foot-deep (1.4 m) channel to be obtained by building wing dams that direct the river to a narrow channel causing it to cut a deeper channel, by closing secondary channels and by dredging. The channel project was complete when the Moline Lock, which bypassed the Rock Island Rapids, opened in 1907.\n\n\nTo improve navigation between St. Paul, Minnesota, and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, the Corps constructed several dams on lakes in the headwaters area, including Lake Winnibigoshish and Lake Pokegama. The dams, which were built beginning in the 1880s, stored spring run-off which was released during low water to help maintain channel depth.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lock and Dam No. 2, near Hastings, Minnesota (2007)\n![](image)Lock and Dam No. 15, is the largest roller dam in the world Davenport, Iowa; Rock Island, Illinois. (1990)\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1907, Congress authorized a 6-foot-deep (1.8 m) channel project on the Mississippi River, which was not complete when it was abandoned in the late 1920s in favor of the 9-foot-deep (2.7 m) channel project.\n\n\nIn 1913, construction was complete on Lock and Dam No. 19 at Keokuk, Iowa, the first dam below St. Anthony Falls. Built by a private power company (Union Electric Company of St. Louis) to generate electricity (originally for streetcars in St. Louis), the Keokuk dam was one of the largest hydro-electric plants in the world at the time. The dam also eliminated the Des Moines Rapids. Lock and Dam No. 1 was completed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1917. Lock and Dam No. 2, near Hastings, Minnesota, was completed in 1930.\n\n\nBefore the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the Corps's primary strategy was to close off as many side channels as possible to increase the flow in the main river. It was thought that the river's velocity would scour off bottom sediments, deepening the river and decreasing the possibility of flooding. The 1927 flood proved this to be so wrong that communities threatened by the flood began to create their own levee breaks to relieve the force of the rising river.\n\n\nThe Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930 authorized the 9-foot (2.7 m) channel project, which called for a navigation channel 9 feet (2.7 m) feet deep and 400 feet (120 m) wide to accommodate multiple-barge tows.[70][71] This was achieved by a series of locks and dams, and by dredging. Twenty-three new locks and dams were built on the upper Mississippi in the 1930s in addition to the three already in existence.\n\n\n\n![](image)Formation of the Atchafalaya River and construction of the Old River Control Structure.\n![](image)Project design flood flow capacity for the Mississippi river in thousands of cubic feet per second.[72]\nUntil the 1950s, there was no dam below Lock and Dam 26 at Alton, Illinois. Chain of Rocks Lock (Lock and Dam No. 27), which consists of a low-water dam and an 8.4-mile-long (13.5 km) canal, was added in 1953, just below the confluence with the Missouri River, primarily to bypass a series of rock ledges at St. Louis. It also serves to protect the St. Louis city water intakes during times of low water.\n\n\nU.S. government scientists determined in the 1950s that the Mississippi River was starting to switch to the Atchafalaya River channel because of its much steeper path to the Gulf of Mexico. Eventually, the Atchafalaya River would capture the Mississippi River and become its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico, leaving New Orleans on a side channel. As a result, the U.S. Congress authorized a project called the Old River Control Structure, which has prevented the Mississippi River from leaving its current channel that drains into the Gulf via New Orleans.[73]\n\n\nBecause the large scale of high-energy water flow threatened to damage the structure, an auxiliary flow control station was built adjacent to the standing control station. This $300 million project was completed in 1986 by the Corps of Engineers. Beginning in the 1970s, the Corps applied hydrological transport models to analyze flood flow and water quality of the Mississippi. Dam 26 at Alton, Illinois, which had structural problems, was replaced by the Mel Price Lock and Dam in 1990. The original Lock and Dam 26 was demolished.\n\n\n\n![](image)Soldiers of the Missouri Army National Guard sandbag the River in Clarksville, Missouri, June 2008, following flooding.\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nThe Corps now actively creates and maintains spillways and floodways to divert periodic water surges into backwater channels and lakes, as well as route part of the Mississippi's flow into the Atchafalaya Basin and from there to the Gulf of Mexico, bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans. The main structures are the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway in Missouri; the Old River Control Structure and the Morganza Spillway in Louisiana, which direct excess water down the west and east sides (respectively) of the Atchafalaya River; and the Bonnet Carré Spillway, also in Louisiana, which directs floodwaters to Lake Pontchartrain (see diagram). Some experts blame urban sprawl for increases in both the risk and frequency of flooding on the Mississippi River.[74]\n\n\nSome of the pre-1927 strategy remains in use today, with the Corps actively cutting the necks of horseshoe bends, allowing the water to move faster and reducing flood heights.[75]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nApproximately 50,000 years ago, the Central United States was covered by an inland sea, which was drained by the Mississippi and its tributaries into the Gulf of Mexico—creating large floodplains and extending the continent further to the south in the process. The soil in areas such as Louisiana was thereafter found to be very rich.[76]\n\n\n\n### Native Americans[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Woodland period, Hopewell tradition, and Mississippian culture\n\nThe area of the Mississippi River basin was first settled by hunting and gathering Native American peoples and is considered one of the few independent centers of plant domestication in human history.[77] Evidence of early cultivation of sunflower, a goosefoot, a marsh elder and an indigenous squash dates to the 4th millennium BC. The lifestyle gradually became more settled after around 1000 BC during what is now called the Woodland period, with increasing evidence of shelter construction, pottery, weaving and other practices.\n\n\nA network of trade routes referred to as the Hopewell interaction sphere was active along the waterways between about 200 and 500 AD, spreading common cultural practices over the entire area between the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes. A period of more isolated communities followed, and agriculture introduced from Mesoamerica based on the Three Sisters (maize, beans and squash) gradually came to dominate. After around 800 AD there arose an advanced agricultural society today referred to as the Mississippian culture, with evidence of highly stratified complex chiefdoms and large population centers.\n\n\nThe most prominent of these, now called Cahokia, was occupied between about 600 and 1400 AD[78] and at its peak numbered between 8,000 and 40,000 inhabitants, larger than London, England of that time. At the time of first contact with Europeans, Cahokia and many other Mississippian cities had dispersed, and archaeological finds attest to increased social stress.[79][80][81]\n\n\nModern American Indian nations inhabiting the Mississippi basin include Cheyenne, Sioux, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, Ho-Chunk, Fox, Kickapoo, Tamaroa, Moingwena, Quapaw and Chickasaw.\n\n\nThe word *Mississippi* itself comes from *Messipi*, the French rendering of the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe or Algonquin) name for the river, *Misi-ziibi* (Great River).[82][83] The Ojibwe called Lake Itasca *Omashkoozo-zaaga'igan* (Elk Lake) and the river flowing out of it *Omashkoozo-ziibi* (Elk River). After flowing into Lake Bemidji, the Ojibwe called the river *Bemijigamaag-ziibi* (River from the Traversing Lake). After flowing into Cass Lake, the name of the river changes to *Gaa-miskwaawaakokaag-ziibi* (Red Cedar River) and then out of Lake Winnibigoshish as *Wiinibiigoonzhish-ziibi* (Miserable Wretched Dirty Water River), *Gichi-ziibi* (Big River) after the confluence with the Leech Lake River, then finally as *Misi-ziibi* (Great River) after the confluence with the Crow Wing River.[84] After the expeditions by Giacomo Beltrami and Henry Schoolcraft, the longest stream above the juncture of the Crow Wing River and *Gichi-ziibi* was named \"Mississippi River\". The Mississippi River Band of Chippewa Indians, known as the *Gichi-ziibiwininiwag*, are named after the stretch of the Mississippi River known as the *Gichi-ziibi*. The Cheyenne, one of the earliest inhabitants of the upper Mississippi River, called it the *Máʼxe-éʼometaaʼe* (Big Greasy River) in the Cheyenne language. The Arapaho name for the river is *Beesniicíe*.[85] The Pawnee name is *Kickaátit*.[86]\n\n\nThe Mississippi was spelled Mississipi or Missisipi during French Louisiana and was also known as the Rivière Saint-Louis.[87][88][89]\n\n\n\n### European exploration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Discovery of the Mississippi by De Soto A.D. 1541* by William Henry Powell depicts Hernando de Soto and Spanish Conquistadores seeing the Mississippi River for the first time.\n![](image)Map of the French settlements (blue) in North America in 1750, before the French and Indian War (1754 to 1763).\n![](image)c. 1681 map of Marquette and Jolliet's 1673 expedition.\n![](image)Route of the Marquette-Jolliete Expedition of 1673\nIn 1519 Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda became the first recorded European to reach the Mississippi River, followed by Hernando de Soto who reached the river on May 8, 1541, and called it *Río del Espíritu Santo* (\"River of the Holy Spirit\"), in the area of what is now Mississippi.[90] In Spanish, the river is called *Río Mississippi*.[91]\n\n\nFrench explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette began exploring the Mississippi in the 17th century. Marquette traveled with a Sioux Indian who named it *Ne Tongo* (\"Big river\" in Sioux language) in 1673. Marquette proposed calling it the *River of the Immaculate Conception*.\n\n\nWhen Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi Valley in the 17th century, natives guided him to a quicker way to return to French Canada via the Illinois River. When he found the Chicago Portage, he remarked that a canal of \"only half a league\" (less than 2 miles or 3 kilometers) would join the Mississippi and the Great Lakes.[92] In 1848, the continental divide separating the waters of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley was breached by the Illinois and Michigan canal via the Chicago River.[93] This both accelerated the development, and forever changed the ecology of the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes.\n\n\nIn 1682, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti claimed the entire Mississippi River valley for France, calling the river *Colbert River* after Jean-Baptiste Colbert and the region *La Louisiane*, for King Louis XIV. On March 2, 1699, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville rediscovered the mouth of the Mississippi, following the death of La Salle.[94] The French built the small fort of La Balise there to control passage.[95]\n\n\nIn 1718, about 100 miles (160 km) upriver, New Orleans was established along the river crescent by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, with construction patterned after the 1711 resettlement on Mobile Bay of Mobile, the capital of French Louisiana at the time.\n\n\nIn 1727, Étienne Perier begins work, using enslaved African laborers, on the first levees on the Mississippi River.\n\n\n\n### Colonization[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Flood of 1851\n\n![](image)*A Home on the Mississippi* (1871)\nFollowing Britain's victory in the Seven Years War, the Mississippi became the border between the British and Spanish Empires. The Treaty of Paris (1763) gave Great Britain rights to all land east of the Mississippi and Spain rights to land west of the Mississippi. Spain also ceded Florida to Britain to regain Cuba, which the British occupied during the war. Britain then divided the territory into East and West Florida.\n\n\nArticle 8 of the Treaty of Paris (1783) states, \"The navigation of the river Mississippi, from its source to the ocean, shall forever remain free and open to the subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States\". With this treaty, which ended the American Revolutionary War, Britain also ceded West Florida back to Spain to regain the Bahamas, which Spain had occupied during the war. Initial disputes around the ensuing claims of the U.S. and Spain were resolved when Spain was pressured into signing Pinckney's Treaty in 1795. However, in 1800, under duress from Napoleon of France, Spain ceded an undefined portion of West Florida to France in the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso. The United States then secured effective control of the river when it bought the Louisiana Territory from France in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. This triggered a dispute between Spain and the U.S. on which parts of West Florida Spain had ceded to France in the first place, which would decide which parts of West Florida the U.S. had bought from France in the Louisiana Purchase, versus which were unceded Spanish property. Due to ongoing U.S. colonization creating facts on the ground, and U.S. military actions, Spain ceded both West and East Florida in their entirety to the United States in the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819.\n\n\nThe last serious European challenge to U.S. control of the river came at the conclusion of the War of 1812, when British forces mounted an attack on New Orleans just 15 days after the signing of the Treaty of Ghent. The attack was repulsed by an American army under the command of General Andrew Jackson.\n\n\nIn the Treaty of 1818, the U.S. and Great Britain agreed to fix the border running from the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains along the 49th parallel north. In effect, the U.S. ceded the northwestern extremity of the Mississippi basin to the British in exchange for the southern portion of the Red River basin.\n\n\nSo many settlers traveled westward through the Mississippi river basin, as well as settled in it, that Zadok Cramer wrote a guidebook called *The Navigator*, detailing the features, dangers, and navigable waterways of the area. It was so popular that he updated and expanded it through 12 editions over 25 years.\n\n\n\n![](image)Shifting sand bars made early navigation difficult.\nThe colonization of the area was barely slowed by the three earthquakes in 1811 and 1812, estimated at 8 on the Richter magnitude scale, that were centered near New Madrid, Missouri.\n\n\n\n### Steamboat era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Steamboats of the Mississippi\n\nMark Twain's book, *Life on the Mississippi*, covered the steamboat commerce, which took place from 1830 to 1870, before more modern ships replaced the steamer. *Harper's Weekly* first published the book as a seven-part serial in 1875. James R. Osgood & Company published the full version, including a passage from the then unfinished *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* and works from other authors, in 1885.\n\n\nThe first steamboat to travel the full length of the Lower Mississippi from the Ohio River to New Orleans was the *New Orleans* in December 1811. Its maiden voyage occurred during the series of New Madrid earthquakes in 1811–12. The Upper Mississippi was treacherous, unpredictable and to make traveling worse, the area was not properly mapped out or surveyed. Until the 1840s, only two trips a year to the Twin Cities landings were made by steamboats, which suggests it was not very profitable.[96]\n\n\nSteamboat transport remained a viable industry, both in terms of passengers and freight, until the end of the first decade of the 20th century. Among the several Mississippi River system steamboat companies was the noted Anchor Line, which, from 1859 to 1898, operated a luxurious fleet of steamers between St. Louis and New Orleans.\n\n\nItalian explorer Giacomo Beltrami wrote about his journey on the *Virginia*, which was the first steamboat to make it to Fort St. Anthony in Minnesota. He referred to his voyage as a promenade that was once a journey on the Mississippi. The steamboat era changed the economic and political life of the Mississippi, as well as of travel itself. The Mississippi was completely changed by the steamboat era as it transformed into a flourishing tourist trade.[97]\n\n\n\n### Civil War[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mississippi River in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)Battle of Vicksburg (ca. 1888)\n![](image)Mississippi River from Eunice, Arkansas, a settlement destroyed by gunboats during the Civil War.\nControl of the river was a strategic objective of both sides in the American Civil War, forming a part of the U.S. Anaconda Plan. In 1862, Union forces coming down the river successfully cleared Confederate defenses at Island Number 10 and Memphis, Tennessee, while Naval forces coming upriver from the Gulf of Mexico captured New Orleans, Louisiana. One of the last major Confederate strongholds was on the heights overlooking the river at Vicksburg, Mississippi; the Union's Vicksburg Campaign (December 1862–July 1863), and the fall of Port Hudson, completed control of the lower Mississippi River. The Union victory ended the Siege of Vicksburg on July 4, 1863, and was pivotal to the Union's final victory of the Civil War.\n\n\n\n### 20th and 21st centuries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Mississippi River floods\n\nThe \"Big Freeze\" of 1918–19 blocked river traffic north of Memphis, Tennessee, preventing transportation of coal from southern Illinois. This resulted in widespread shortages, high prices, and rationing of coal in January and February.[98]\n\n\nIn the spring of 1927, the river broke out of its banks in 145 places, during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and inundated 27,000 sq mi (70,000 km2) to a depth of up to 30 feet (9.1 m).\n\n\nIn 1930, Fred Newton was the first person to swim the length of the river, from Minneapolis to New Orleans. The journey took 176 days and covered 1,836 miles.[99][100]\n\n\nIn 1962 and 1963, industrial accidents spilled 3.5 million US gallons (13,000 m3) of soybean oil into the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers. The oil covered the Mississippi River from St. Paul to Lake Pepin, creating an ecological disaster and a demand to control water pollution.[101]\n\n\nOn October 20, 1976, the automobile ferry, *MV George Prince*, was struck by a ship traveling upstream as the ferry attempted to cross from Destrehan, Louisiana, to Luling, Louisiana. Seventy-eight passengers and crew died; only eighteen survived the accident.\n\n\nIn 1988, the water level of the Mississippi fell to 10 feet (3.0 m) below zero on the Memphis gauge. The remains of wooden-hulled water craft were exposed in an area of 4.5 acres (1.8 ha) on the bottom of the Mississippi River at West Memphis, Arkansas. They dated to the late 19th to early 20th centuries. The State of Arkansas, the Arkansas Archeological Survey, and the Arkansas Archeological Society responded with a two-month data recovery effort. The fieldwork received national media attention as good news in the middle of a drought.[102]\n\n\nThe Great Flood of 1993 was another significant flood, primarily affecting the Mississippi above its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois.\n\n\nTwo portions of the Mississippi were designated as American Heritage Rivers in 1997: the lower portion around Louisiana and Tennessee, and the upper portion around Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin. The Nature Conservancy's project called \"America's Rivershed Initiative\" announced a 'report card' assessment of the entire basin in October 2015 and gave the grade of D+. The assessment noted the aging navigation and flood control infrastructure along with multiple environmental problems.[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Campsite at the river in Arkansas\nIn 2002, Slovenian long-distance swimmer Martin Strel swam the entire length of the river, from Minnesota to Louisiana, over the course of 68 days. In 2005, the Source to Sea Expedition[104] paddled the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers to benefit the Audubon Society's Upper Mississippi River Campaign.[105][106]\n\n\n\n### Future[edit]\n\n\nGeologists believe that the lower Mississippi could take a new course to the Gulf. Either of two new routes—through the Atchafalaya Basin or through Lake Pontchartrain—might become the Mississippi's main channel if flood-control structures are overtopped or heavily damaged during a severe flood.[107][108][109][110][111]\n\n\nFailure of the Old River Control Structure, the Morganza Spillway, or nearby levees would likely re-route the main channel of the Mississippi through Louisiana's Atchafalaya Basin and down the Atchafalaya River to reach the Gulf of Mexico south of Morgan City in southern Louisiana. This route provides a more direct path to the Gulf of Mexico than the present Mississippi River channel through Baton Rouge and New Orleans.[109] While the risk of such a diversion is present during any major flood event, such a change has so far been prevented by active human intervention involving the construction, maintenance, and operation of various levees, spillways, and other control structures by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Old River Control Structure complex. View is to the east-southeast, looking downriver on the Mississippi, with the three dams across channels of the Atchafalaya River to the right of the Mississippi. Concordia Parish, Louisiana is in the foreground, on the right, and Wilkinson County, Mississippi, is in the background, across the Mississippi on the left.\nThe Old River Control Structure, between the present Mississippi River channel and the Atchafalaya Basin, sits at the normal water elevation and is ordinarily used to divert 30% of the Mississippi flow to the Atchafalaya River. There is a steep drop here away from the Mississippi's main channel into the Atchafalaya Basin. If this facility were to fail during a major flood, there is a strong concern the water would scour and erode the river bottom enough to capture the Mississippi's main channel. The structure was nearly lost during the 1973 flood, but repairs and improvements were made after engineers studied the forces at play. In particular, the Corps of Engineers made many improvements and constructed additional facilities for routing water through the vicinity. These additional facilities give the Corps much more flexibility and potential flow capacity than they had in 1973, which further reduces the risk of a catastrophic failure in this area during other major floods, such as that of 2011.\n\n\nBecause the Morganza Spillway is slightly higher and well back from the river, it is normally dry on both sides.[112] Even if it failed at the crest during a severe flood, the floodwaters would have to erode to normal water levels before the Mississippi could permanently jump channel at this location.[113][114] During the 2011 floods, the Corps of Engineers opened the Morganza Spillway to 1/4 of its capacity to allow 150,000 cubic feet per second (4,200 m3/s) of water to flood the Morganza and Atchafalaya floodways and continue directly to the Gulf of Mexico, bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans.[115] In addition to reducing the Mississippi River crest downstream, this diversion reduced the chances of a channel change by reducing stress on the other elements of the control system.[116]\n\n\nSome geologists have noted that the possibility for course change into the Atchafalaya also exists in the area immediately north of the Old River Control Structure. Army Corps of Engineers geologist Fred Smith once stated, \"The Mississippi wants to go west. 1973 was a forty-year flood. The big one lies out there somewhere—when the structures can't release all the floodwaters and the levee is going to have to give way. That is when the river's going to jump its banks and try to break through.\"[117]\n\n\nAnother possible course change for the Mississippi River is a diversion into Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans. This route is controlled by the Bonnet Carré Spillway, built to reduce flooding in New Orleans. This spillway and an imperfect natural levee about 12–20 ft (3.7–6.1 m) high are all that prevents the Mississippi from taking a new, shorter course through Lake Pontchartrain to the Gulf of Mexico.[118] Diversion of the Mississippi's main channel through Lake Pontchartrain would have consequences similar to an Atchafalaya diversion, but to a lesser extent, since the present river channel would remain in use past Baton Rouge and into the New Orleans area.\n\n\n\n## Recreation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Great River Road in Wisconsin near Lake Pepin (2005)\nThe sport of water skiing was invented on the river in a wide region between Minnesota and Wisconsin known as Lake Pepin.[119] Ralph Samuelson of Lake City, Minnesota, created and refined his skiing technique in late June and early July 1922. He later performed the first water ski jump in 1925 and was pulled along at 80 mph (130 km/h) by a Curtiss flying boat later that year.[119]\n\n\nThere are seven National Park Service sites along the Mississippi River. The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area is the National Park Service site dedicated to protecting and interpreting the Mississippi River itself. The other six National Park Service sites along the river are (listed from north to south):\n\n\n\n* Effigy Mounds National Monument\n* Gateway Arch National Park (includes Gateway Arch)\n* Vicksburg National Military Park\n* Natchez National Historical Park\n* New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park\n* Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mississippi River System § Ecology\n\n![](image)The American paddlefish is an ancient relict from the Mississippi\nThe Mississippi basin is home to a highly diverse aquatic fauna and has been called the \"mother fauna\" of North American freshwater.[120]\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\nAbout 375 fish species are known from the Mississippi basin, far exceeding other North Hemisphere river basins exclusively within temperate/subtropical regions,[120] except the Yangtze.[121] Within the Mississippi basin, streams that have their source in the Appalachian and Ozark highlands contain especially many species. Among the fish species in the basin are numerous endemics, as well as relicts such as paddlefish, sturgeon, gar and bowfin.[120]\n\n\nBecause of its size and high species diversity, the Mississippi basin is often divided into subregions. The Upper Mississippi River alone is home to about 120 fish species, including walleye, sauger, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, white bass, northern pike, bluegill, crappie, channel catfish, flathead catfish, common shiner, freshwater drum, and shovelnose sturgeon.[122][123]\n\n\n\n### Other fauna[edit]\n\n\nA large number of reptiles are native to the river channels and basin, including American alligators, several species of turtle, aquatic amphibians,[124] and cambaridae crayfish, are native to the Mississippi basin.[125]\n\n\nIn addition, approximately 40% of the migratory birds in the US use the Mississippi River corridor during Spring and Fall migrations; 60% of all migratory birds in North America (326 species) use the river basin as their flyway.[126]\n\n\n\n### Introduced species[edit]\n\n\nNumerous introduced species are found in the Mississippi and some of these are invasive. Among the introductions are fish such as Asian carp, including the silver carp that have become infamous for out-competing native fish and their potentially dangerous jumping behavior. They have spread throughout much of the basin, even approaching (but not yet invading) the Great Lakes.[127] The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has designated much of the Mississippi River in the state as infested waters by the exotic species zebra mussels and Eurasian watermilfoil.[128]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Atchafalaya Basin\n* Capes on the Mississippi River\n* Chemetco\n* Great River Road\n* List of crossings of the Lower Mississippi River\n* List of crossings of the Upper Mississippi River\n* List of locks and dams of the Upper Mississippi River\n* List of tributaries of the Mississippi River\n* List of longest rivers of the United States (by main stem)\n* Mississippi embayment\n* Mississippi River floods\n* Mississippi River System\n* *The Waterways Journal Weekly*\n* Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Ojibwe: Misi-ziibi,[8] Dakota: Mníšošethąka,[9] Myaamia: Mihsi-siipiiwi,[10] Cheyenne: Ma'xeé'ometāā'e,[11] Kiowa: Xósáu,[12] Arapaho: Beesniicie,[13] Pawnee: Kickaátit[14]\n2. **^** Arguably, the Mississippi basin is the second-largest drainage system in North America, second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system, although Hudson Bay may rather be considered an arm of the ocean.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** James L.

With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains.[17] The main stem is entirely within the United States; the total drainage basin is 1,151,000 sq mi (2,980,000 km2), of which only about one percent is in Canada. The Mississippi ranks as the thirteenth-largest river by discharge in the world. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.[18][19]\n\n\nNative Americans have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years. Most were hunter-gatherers, but some, such as the Mound Builders, formed prolific agricultural and urban civilizations. The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers, then settlers, ventured into the basin in increasing numbers.[20] The river served first as a barrier, forming borders for New Spain, New France, and the early United States, and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link. In the 19th century, during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny, the Mississippi and several western tributaries, most notably the Missouri, formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States.\n\n\nFormed from thick layers of the river's silt deposits, the Mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile regions of the United States; steamboats were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to ship agricultural and industrial goods. During the American Civil War, the Mississippi's capture by Union forces marked a turning point towards victory, due to the river's strategic importance to the Confederate war effort. Because of the substantial growth of cities and the larger ships and barges that replaced steamboats, the first decades of the 20th century saw the construction of massive engineering works such as levees, locks and dams, often built in combination. A major focus of this work has been to prevent the lower Mississippi from shifting into the channel of the Atchafalaya River and bypassing New Orleans.\n\n\nSince the 20th century, the Mississippi River has also experienced major pollution and environmental problems — most notably elevated nutrient and chemical levels from agricultural runoff, the primary contributor to the Gulf of Mexico dead zone.\n\n\n\n\n## Name and significance[edit]\n\n\nThe word Mississippi itself comes from *Misi zipi*, the French rendering of the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe or Algonquin) name for the river, *Misi-ziibi* (Great River).[21]\n\n\nIn the 18th century, the river was set by the Treaty of Paris as, for the most part, the western border of the new United States. With the Louisiana Purchase and the country's westward expansion, it became a convenient boundary line between the western and eastern halves of the country.[22][23] This is reflected in the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, which was designed to symbolize the opening of the West,[24] and the focus on the \"Trans-Mississippi\" region in the Trans-Mississippi Exposition.[25]\n\n\nRegional landmarks are often classified in relation to the river, such as \"the highest peak east of the Mississippi\"[26] or \"the oldest city west of the Mississippi\".[27] The FCC also uses it as the dividing line for broadcast call-signs, which begin with W to the east and K to the west, overlapping in media markets along the river.\n\n\n\n## Divisions[edit]\n\n\nThe Mississippi River can be divided into three sections: the Upper Mississippi, the river from its headwaters to the confluence with the Missouri River; the Middle Mississippi, which is downriver from the Missouri to the Ohio River; and the Lower Mississippi, which flows from the Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n\n### Upper Mississippi[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Upper Mississippi River\n\n![](image)The source of the Mississippi River at Lake Itasca\n![A log bridge over a very small river on an autumnal, cloudy day with flurries of snow](image)The first bridge (and only log bridge) over the Mississippi, about 25 feet south of its source at Lake Itasca\n![St. Anthony Falls](image)Former head of navigation, St. Anthony Falls, Minneapolis, Minnesota\n![](image)Confluence of the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers, viewed from Wyalusing State Park in Wisconsin\nThe Upper Mississippi runs from its headwaters to its confluence with the Missouri River at St. Louis, Missouri. It is divided into two sections:\n\n\n\n1. The headwaters, 493 miles (793 km) from the source to Saint Anthony Falls in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and\n2. A navigable channel, formed by a series of man-made lakes between Minneapolis and St. Louis, Missouri, some 664 miles (1,069 km).\n\n\nBarge on Upper Mississippi North of Lock and Dam No. 8\nThe source of the Upper Mississippi branch is traditionally accepted as Lake Itasca, 1,475 feet (450 m) above sea level in Itasca State Park in Clearwater County, Minnesota. The name *Itasca* was chosen to designate the \"true head\" of the Mississippi River as a combination of the last four letters of the Latin word for truth (*ver**itas***) and the first two letters of the Latin word for head (***ca**put*).[28] However, the lake is in turn fed by a number of smaller streams.\n\n\nFrom its origin at Lake Itasca to St. Louis, Missouri, the waterway's flow is moderated by 43 dams. Fourteen of these dams are located above Minneapolis in the headwaters region and serve multiple purposes, including power generation and recreation. The remaining 29 dams, beginning in downtown Minneapolis, all contain locks and were constructed to improve commercial navigation of the upper river. Taken as a whole, these 43 dams significantly shape the geography and influence the ecology of the upper river. Beginning just below Saint Paul, Minnesota, and continuing throughout the upper and lower river, the Mississippi is further controlled by thousands of wing dikes that moderate the river's flow in order to maintain an open navigation channel and prevent the river from eroding its banks.\n\n\nThe head of navigation on the Mississippi is the St. Anthony Falls Lock.[29] Before the Coon Rapids Dam in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, was built in 1913, steamboats could occasionally go upstream as far as Saint Cloud, Minnesota, depending on river conditions.\n\n\nThe uppermost lock and dam on the Upper Mississippi River is the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam in Minneapolis. Above the dam, the river's elevation is 799 feet (244 m). Below the dam, the river's elevation is 750 feet (230 m). This 49-foot (15 m) drop is the largest of all the Mississippi River locks and dams. The origin of the dramatic drop is a waterfall preserved adjacent to the lock under an apron of concrete. Saint Anthony Falls is the only true waterfall on the entire Mississippi River. The water elevation continues to drop steeply as it passes through the gorge carved by the waterfall.\n\n\nAfter the completion of the St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam in 1963, the river's head of navigation moved upstream, to the Coon Rapids Dam. However, the Locks were closed in 2015 to control the spread of invasive Asian carp, making Minneapolis once again the site of the head of navigation of the river.[29]\n\n\nThe Upper Mississippi has a number of natural and artificial lakes, with its widest point being Lake Winnibigoshish, near Grand Rapids, Minnesota, over 11 miles (18 km) across. Lake Onalaska, created by Lock and Dam No. 7, near La Crosse, Wisconsin, is more than 4 miles (6.4 km) wide. Lake Pepin, a natural lake formed behind the delta of the Chippewa River of Wisconsin as it enters the Upper Mississippi, is more than 2 miles (3.2 km) wide.[30]\n\n\nBy the time the Upper Mississippi reaches Saint Paul, Minnesota, below Lock and Dam No. 1, it has dropped more than half its original elevation and is 687 feet (209 m) above sea level. From St. Paul to St. Louis, Missouri, the river elevation falls much more slowly and is controlled and managed as a series of pools created by 26 locks and dams.[31]\n\n\nThe Upper Mississippi River is joined by the Minnesota River at Fort Snelling in the Twin Cities; the St. Croix River near Prescott, Wisconsin; the Cannon River near Red Wing, Minnesota; the Zumbro River at Wabasha, Minnesota; the Black, La Crosse, and Root rivers in La Crosse, Wisconsin; the Wisconsin River at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin; the Rock River at the Quad Cities; the Iowa River near Wapello, Iowa; the Skunk River south of Burlington, Iowa; and the Des Moines River at Keokuk, Iowa. Other major tributaries of the Upper Mississippi include the Crow River in Minnesota, the Chippewa River in Wisconsin, the Maquoketa River and the Wapsipinicon River in Iowa, and the Illinois River in Illinois.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Upper Mississippi River at its confluence with the Missouri River north of St. Louis\nThe Upper Mississippi is largely a multi-thread stream with many bars and islands. From its confluence with the St. Croix River downstream to Dubuque, Iowa, the river is entrenched, with high bedrock bluffs lying on either side. The height of these bluffs decreases to the south of Dubuque, though they are still significant through Savanna, Illinois. This topography contrasts strongly with the Lower Mississippi, which is a meandering river in a broad, flat area, only rarely flowing alongside a bluff (as at Vicksburg, Mississippi).\n\n\n\n![](image)The confluence of the Mississippi (left) and Ohio (right) rivers at Cairo, Illinois, the demarcation between the Middle and the Lower Mississippi River\n### Middle Mississippi[edit]\n\n\nThe Mississippi River is known as the Middle Mississippi from the Upper Mississippi River's confluence with the Missouri River at St. Louis, Missouri, for 190 miles (310 km) to its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois.[32][33]\n\n\nThe Middle Mississippi is relatively free-flowing. From St. Louis to the Ohio River confluence, the Middle Mississippi falls 220 feet (67 m) over 180 miles (290 km) for an average rate of 1.2 feet per mile (23 cm/km). At its confluence with the Ohio River, the Middle Mississippi is 315 feet (96 m) above sea level. Apart from the Missouri and Meramec rivers of Missouri and the Kaskaskia River of Illinois, no major tributaries enter the Middle Mississippi River.\n\n\n\n### Lower Mississippi[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lower Mississippi River\n\n![](image)Lower Mississippi River at Algiers Point in New Orleans\nThe Mississippi River is called the Lower Mississippi River from its confluence with the Ohio River to its mouth at the Gulf of Mexico, a distance of about 1,000 miles (1,600 km). At the confluence of the Ohio and the Middle Mississippi, the long-term mean discharge of the Ohio at Cairo, Illinois is 281,500 cubic feet per second (7,970 cubic meters per second),[34] while the long-term mean discharge of the Mississippi at Thebes, Illinois (just upriver from Cairo) is 208,200 cu ft/s (5,900 m3/s).[35] Thus, by volume, the main branch of the Mississippi River system at Cairo can be considered to be the Ohio River (and the Allegheny River further upstream), rather than the Middle Mississippi.\n\n\nIn addition to the Ohio River, the major tributaries of the Lower Mississippi River are the White River, flowing in at the White River National Wildlife Refuge in east-central Arkansas; the Arkansas River, joining the Mississippi at Arkansas Post; the Big Black River in Mississippi; and the Yazoo River, meeting the Mississippi at Vicksburg, Mississippi.\n\n\nDeliberate water diversion at the Old River Control Structure in Louisiana allows the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana to be a major distributary of the Mississippi River, with 30% of the combined flow of the Mississippi and Red Rivers flowing to the Gulf of Mexico by this route, rather than continuing down the Mississippi's current channel past Baton Rouge and New Orleans on a longer route to the Gulf.[36][37][38][39] Although the Red River was once an additional tributary, its water now flows separately into the Gulf of Mexico through the Atchafalaya River.[40]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the Mississippi River watershed\nAn animation of the flows along the rivers of the Mississippi watershed\nSee also: List of drainage basins by area\n\nThe Mississippi River has the world's fourth-largest drainage basin (\"watershed\" or \"catchment\"). The basin covers more than 1,245,000 square miles (3,220,000 km2), including all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. The drainage basin empties into the Gulf of Mexico, part of the Atlantic Ocean. The total catchment of the Mississippi River covers nearly 40% of the landmass of the continental United States. The highest point within the watershed is also the highest point of the Rocky Mountains, Mount Elbert at 14,440 feet (4,400 m).[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sequence of NASA MODIS images showing the outflow of fresh water from the Mississippi (arrows) into the Gulf of Mexico (2004)\nIn the United States, the Mississippi River drains the majority of the area between the crest of the Rocky Mountains and the crest of the Appalachian Mountains, except for various regions drained to Hudson Bay by the Red River of the North; to the Atlantic Ocean by the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River; and to the Gulf of Mexico by the Rio Grande, the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers, the Chattahoochee and Appalachicola rivers, and various smaller coastal waterways along the Gulf.\n\n\nThe Mississippi River empties into the Gulf of Mexico about 100 miles (160 km) downstream from New Orleans. Measurements of the length of the Mississippi from Lake Itasca to the Gulf of Mexico vary somewhat, but the United States Geological Survey's number is 2,340 miles (3,766 km). The retention time from Lake Itasca to the Gulf is typically about 90 days;[42] while speed varies along the course of the river, this gives an overall average of around 26 mi (42 km) per day, or 1 mi (1.6 km) per hour.\n\n\nThe stream gradient of the entire river is 0.01%, a drop of 450 m over 3,766 km.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Outflow[edit]\n\n\nThe Mississippi River discharges at an annual average rate of between 200 and 700 thousand cubic feet per second (6,000 and 20,000 m3/s).[43] The Mississippi is the fourteenth largest river in the world by volume. On average, the Mississippi has 8% the flow of the Amazon River,[44]\nwhich moves nearly 7 million cubic feet per second (200,000 m3/s) during wet seasons.\n\n\nBefore 1900, the Mississippi River transported an estimated 440 million short tons (400 million metric tons) of sediment per year from the interior of the United States to coastal Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico. During the last two decades, this number was only 160 million short tons (145 million metric tons) per year. The reduction in sediment transported down the Mississippi River is the result of engineering modification of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio rivers and their tributaries by dams, meander cutoffs, river-training structures, and bank revetments and soil erosion control programs in the areas drained by them.[45]\n\n\n\n### Mixing with salt water[edit]\n\n\nDenser salt water from the Gulf of Mexico forms a salt wedge along the river bottom near the mouth of the river, while fresh water flows near the surface. In drought years, with less fresh water to push it out, salt water can travel many miles upstream—64 miles (103 km) in 2022—contaminating drinking water supplies and requiring the use of desalination. The United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed \"saltwater sills\" or \"underwater levees\" to contain this in 1988, 1999, 2012, and 2022. This consists of a large mound of sand spanning the width of the river 55 feet below the surface, allowing fresh water and large cargo ships to pass over.[46]\n\n\nFresh river water flowing from the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico does not mix into the salt water immediately. The images from NASA's MODIS show a large plume of fresh water, which appears as a dark ribbon against the lighter-blue surrounding waters. These images demonstrate that the plume did not mix with the surrounding sea water immediately. Instead, it stayed intact as it flowed through the Gulf of Mexico, into the Straits of Florida, and entered the Gulf Stream. The Mississippi River water rounded the tip of Florida and traveled up the southeast coast to the latitude of Georgia before finally mixing in so thoroughly with the ocean that it could no longer be detected by MODIS.\n\n\n\n## Course changes[edit]\n\n\nOver geologic time, the Mississippi River has experienced numerous large and small changes to its main course, as well as additions, deletions, and other changes among its numerous tributaries, and the lower Mississippi River has used different pathways as its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico across the delta region.\n\n\nAs Pangaea began to break up about 95 million years ago, North America passed over a volcanic \"hotspot\" in the Earth's mantle (specifically, the Bermuda hotspot) that was undergoing a period of intense activity. The upwelling of magma from the hotspot forced the further uplift to a height of perhaps 2–3 km of part of the Appalachian-Ouachita range, forming an arch that blocked southbound water flows. The uplifted land quickly eroded and, as North America moved away from the hot spot and as the hotspot's activity declined, the crust beneath the embayment region cooled, contracted and subsided to a depth of 2.6 km, and around 80 million years ago the Reelfoot Rift formed a trough that was flooded by the Gulf of Mexico. As sea levels dropped, the Mississippi and other rivers extended their courses into the embayment, which gradually became filled with sediment with the Mississippi River at its center.[47][48]\n\n\nThrough a natural process known as avulsion or delta switching, the lower Mississippi River has shifted its final course to the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico every thousand years or so. This occurs because the deposits of silt and sediment begin to clog its channel, raising the river's level and causing it to eventually find a steeper, more direct route to the Gulf of Mexico. The abandoned distributaries diminish in volume and form what are known as bayous. This process has, over the past 5,000 years, caused the coastline of south Louisiana to advance toward the Gulf from 15 to 50 miles (24 to 80 km). The currently active delta lobe is called the Birdfoot Delta, after its shape, or the Balize Delta, after La Balize, Louisiana, the first French settlement at the mouth of the Mississippi.\n\n\n\n### Prehistoric courses[edit]\n\n\nThe current form of the Mississippi River basin was largely shaped by the Laurentide Ice Sheet of the most recent Ice Age. The southernmost extent of this enormous glaciation extended well into the present-day United States and Mississippi basin. When the ice sheet began to recede, hundreds of feet of rich sediment were deposited, creating the flat and fertile landscape of the Mississippi Valley. During the melt, giant glacial rivers found drainage paths into the Mississippi watershed, creating such features as the Minnesota River, James River, and Milk River valleys. When the ice sheet completely retreated, many of these \"temporary\" rivers found paths to Hudson Bay or the Arctic Ocean, leaving the Mississippi Basin with many features \"over-sized\" for the existing rivers to have carved in the same time period.\n\n\nIce sheets during the Illinoian Stage, about 300,000 to 132,000 years before present, blocked the Mississippi near Rock Island, Illinois, diverting it to its present channel farther to the west, the current western border of Illinois. The Hennepin Canal roughly follows the ancient channel of the Mississippi downstream from Rock Island to Hennepin, Illinois. South of Hennepin, to Alton, Illinois, the current Illinois River follows the ancient channel used by the Mississippi River before the Illinoian Stage.[49][50]\n\n\n\n![](image)View along the former riverbed at the Tennessee/Arkansas state line near Reverie, Tennessee (2007)\nTimeline of outflow course changes[51]\n\n\n\n* c. 5000 BC: The last ice age ended; world sea level became what it is now.\n* c. 2500 BC: Bayou Teche became the main course of the Mississippi.\n* c. 800 BC: The Mississippi diverted further east.\n* c. 200 AD: Bayou Lafourche became the main course of the Mississippi.\n* c. 1000 AD: The Mississippi's present course took over.\n* Before c. 1400 AD: The Red River of the South flowed parallel to the lower Mississippi to the sea\n* 15th century: Turnbull's Bend in the lower Mississippi extended so far west that it captured the Red River of the South.

Shreve dug a new short course for the Mississippi through the neck of Turnbull's Bend.\n* 1833 to November 1873: The Great Raft (a huge logjam in the Atchafalaya River) was cleared. The Atchafalaya started to capture the Mississippi and to become its new main lower course.\n* 1963: The Old River Control Structure was completed, controlling how much Mississippi water entered the Atchafalaya.\n\n\n### Historic course changes[edit]\n\n\nIn March 1876, the Mississippi suddenly changed course near the settlement of Reverie, Tennessee, leaving a small part of Tipton County, Tennessee, attached to Arkansas and separated from the rest of Tennessee by the new river channel. Since this event was an avulsion, rather than the effect of incremental erosion and deposition, the state line still follows the old channel.[52]\n\n\nThe town of Kaskaskia, Illinois once stood on a peninsula at the confluence of the Mississippi and Kaskaskia (Okaw) Rivers. Founded as a French colonial community, it later became the capital of the Illinois Territory and was the first state capital of Illinois until 1819. Beginning in 1844, successive flooding caused the Mississippi River to slowly encroach east. A major flood in 1881 caused it to overtake the lower 10 miles (16 km) of the Kaskaskia River, forming a new Mississippi channel and cutting off the town from the rest of the state. Later flooding destroyed most of the remaining town, including the original State House. Today, the remaining 2,300 acres (930 ha) island and community of 14 residents is known as an enclave of Illinois and is accessible only from the Missouri side.[53]\n\n\n\n### New Madrid Seismic Zone[edit]\n\n\nThe New Madrid Seismic Zone, along the Mississippi River near New Madrid, Missouri, between Memphis and St. Louis, is related to an aulacogen (failed rift) that formed at the same time as the Gulf of Mexico. This area is still quite active seismically. Four great earthquakes in 1811 and 1812, estimated at 8 on the Richter magnitude scale, had tremendous local effects in the then sparsely settled area, and were felt in many other places in the Midwestern and eastern U.S. These earthquakes created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee from the altered landscape near the river.\n\n\n\n## Length[edit]\n\n\nWhen measured from its traditional source at Lake Itasca, the Mississippi has a length of 2,340 miles (3,766 km). When measured from its longest stream source (most distant source from the sea), Brower's Spring in Montana, the source of the Missouri River, it has a length of 3,710 miles (5,971 km), making it the fourth longest river in the world after the Nile, Amazon, and Yangtze.[54] When measured by the largest stream source (by water volume), the Ohio River, by extension the Allegheny River, would be the source, and the Mississippi would begin in Pennsylvania.[55]\n\n\n\n## Depth[edit]\n\n\nAt its source at Lake Itasca, the Mississippi River is about 3 feet (0.91 m) deep. The average depth of the Mississippi River between Saint Paul and Saint Louis is between 9 and 12 feet (2.7–3.7 m) deep, the deepest part being Lake Pepin, which averages 20–32 feet (6–10 m) deep and has a maximum depth of 60 feet (18 m). Between where the Missouri River joins the Mississippi at Saint Louis, Missouri, and Cairo, Illinois, the depth averages 30 feet (9 m). Below Cairo, where the Ohio River joins, the depth averages 50–100 feet (15–30 m) deep. The deepest part of the river is in New Orleans, where it reaches 200 feet (61 m) deep.[56][57]\n\n\n\n## Cultural geography[edit]\n\n\n### State boundaries[edit]\n\n\nThe Mississippi River runs through or along 10 states, from Minnesota to Louisiana, and is used to define portions of these states borders, with Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi along the east side of the river, and Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansas along its west side. Substantial parts of both Minnesota and Louisiana are on either side of the river, although the Mississippi defines part of the boundary of each of these states.\n\n\nIn all of these cases, the middle of the riverbed at the time the borders were established was used as the line to define the borders between adjacent states.[58][59] In various areas, the river has since shifted, but the state borders have not changed, still following the former bed of the Mississippi River as of their establishment, leaving several small isolated areas of one state across the new river channel, contiguous with the adjacent state. Also, due to a meander in the river, a small part of western Kentucky is contiguous with Tennessee but isolated from the rest of its state.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nLake Pepin, the widest naturally occurring part of the Mississippi, is part of the Minnesota–Wisconsin border.\n\n![](image)\nThe Mississippi River in downtown Baton Rouge\n\n### Communities along the river[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Metro Area\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Minneapolis–Saint Paul | 3,946,533\n |\n| St. Louis | 2,916,447\n |\n| Memphis | 1,316,100\n |\n| New Orleans | 1,214,932\n |\n| Baton Rouge | 802,484\n |\n| Quad Cities, IA-IL | 387,630\n |\n| St. Cloud, MN | 189,148\n |\n| La Crosse, WI | 133,365\n |\n| Cape Girardeau–Jackson MO-IL | 96,275\n |\n| Dubuque, IA | 93,653\n |\n\n\n![](image)In Minnesota, the Mississippi River runs through the Twin Cities (2007)\n![](image)Community of boathouses on the Mississippi River in Winona, MN (2006)\n![](image)The Mississippi River at the Chain of Rocks just north of St. Louis (2005)\n![](image)A low-water dam deepens the pool above the Chain of Rocks Lock near St. Louis (2006)\nMany of the communities along the Mississippi River are listed below; most have either historic significance or cultural lore connecting them to the river.

It spanned the river in Minneapolis where the current Hennepin Avenue Bridge is located.[61] No highway or railroad tunnels cross under the Mississippi River.\n\n\nThe first railroad bridge across the Mississippi was built in 1856. It spanned the river between the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois and Davenport, Iowa. Steamboat captains of the day, fearful of competition from the railroads, considered the new bridge a hazard to navigation. Two weeks after the bridge opened, the steamboat *Effie Afton* rammed part of the bridge, setting it on fire. Legal proceedings ensued, with Abraham Lincoln defending the railroad. The lawsuit went to the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled in favor of the railroad.[62]\n\n\nBelow is a general overview of selected Mississippi bridges that have notable engineering or landmark significance, with their cities or locations.

The task of maintaining a navigation channel is the responsibility of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which was established in 1802.[65] Earlier projects began as early as 1829 to remove snags, close off secondary channels and excavate rocks and sandbars.\n\n\n\n![](image)Oil tanker on the Lower Mississippi near the Port of New Orleans\n![](image)Barge on the Lower Mississippi River\nA series of 29 locks and dams on the upper Mississippi, most of which were built in the 1930s, is designed primarily to maintain a 9-foot-deep (2.7 m) channel for commercial barge traffic.[66][67] The lakes formed are also used for recreational boating and fishing. The dams make the river deeper and wider but do not stop it. No flood control is intended. During periods of high flow, the gates, some of which are submersible, are completely opened and the dams simply cease to function. Below St. Louis, the Mississippi is relatively free-flowing, although it is constrained by numerous levees and directed by numerous wing dams. The scope and scale of the levees, built along either side of the river to keep it on its course, has often been compared to the Great Wall of China.[36]\n\n\nOn the lower Mississippi, from Baton Rouge to the mouth of the Mississippi, the navigation depth is 45 feet (14 m), allowing container ships and cruise ships to dock at the Port of New Orleans and bulk cargo ships shorter than 150-foot (46 m) air draft that fit under the Huey P. Long Bridge to traverse the Mississippi to Baton Rouge.[68] There is a feasibility study to dredge this portion of the river to 50 feet (15 m) to allow New Panamax ship depths.[69]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lock and Dam No. 11, north of Dubuque, Iowa (2007)\nIn 1829, there were surveys of the two major obstacles on the upper Mississippi, the Des Moines Rapids and the Rock Island Rapids, where the river was shallow and the riverbed was rock. The Des Moines Rapids were about 11 miles (18 km) long and just above the mouth of the Des Moines River at Keokuk, Iowa. The Rock Island Rapids were between Rock Island and Moline, Illinois. Both rapids were considered virtually impassable.\n\n\nIn 1848, the Illinois and Michigan Canal was built to connect the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan via the Illinois River near Peru, Illinois. The canal allowed shipping between these important waterways. In 1900, the canal was replaced by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. The second canal, in addition to shipping, also allowed Chicago to address specific health issues (typhoid fever, cholera and other waterborne diseases) by sending its waste down the Illinois and Mississippi river systems rather than polluting its water source of Lake Michigan.\n\n\nThe Corps of Engineers recommended the excavation of a 5-foot-deep (1.5 m) channel at the Des Moines Rapids, but work did not begin until after Lieutenant Robert E. Lee endorsed the project in 1837. The Corps later also began excavating the Rock Island Rapids. By 1866, it had become evident that excavation was impractical, and it was decided to build a canal around the Des Moines Rapids. The canal opened in 1877, but the Rock Island Rapids remained an obstacle. In 1878, Congress authorized the Corps to establish a 4.5-foot-deep (1.4 m) channel to be obtained by building wing dams that direct the river to a narrow channel causing it to cut a deeper channel, by closing secondary channels and by dredging. The channel project was complete when the Moline Lock, which bypassed the Rock Island Rapids, opened in 1907.\n\n\nTo improve navigation between St. Paul, Minnesota, and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, the Corps constructed several dams on lakes in the headwaters area, including Lake Winnibigoshish and Lake Pokegama. The dams, which were built beginning in the 1880s, stored spring run-off which was released during low water to help maintain channel depth.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lock and Dam No. 2, near Hastings, Minnesota (2007)\n![](image)Lock and Dam No. 15, is the largest roller dam in the world Davenport, Iowa; Rock Island, Illinois. (1990)\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1907, Congress authorized a 6-foot-deep (1.8 m) channel project on the Mississippi River, which was not complete when it was abandoned in the late 1920s in favor of the 9-foot-deep (2.7 m) channel project.\n\n\nIn 1913, construction was complete on Lock and Dam No. 19 at Keokuk, Iowa, the first dam below St. Anthony Falls. Built by a private power company (Union Electric Company of St. Louis) to generate electricity (originally for streetcars in St. Louis), the Keokuk dam was one of the largest hydro-electric plants in the world at the time. The dam also eliminated the Des Moines Rapids. Lock and Dam No. 1 was completed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1917. Lock and Dam No. 2, near Hastings, Minnesota, was completed in 1930.\n\n\nBefore the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the Corps's primary strategy was to close off as many side channels as possible to increase the flow in the main river. It was thought that the river's velocity would scour off bottom sediments, deepening the river and decreasing the possibility of flooding. The 1927 flood proved this to be so wrong that communities threatened by the flood began to create their own levee breaks to relieve the force of the rising river.\n\n\nThe Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930 authorized the 9-foot (2.7 m) channel project, which called for a navigation channel 9 feet (2.7 m) feet deep and 400 feet (120 m) wide to accommodate multiple-barge tows.[70][71] This was achieved by a series of locks and dams, and by dredging. Twenty-three new locks and dams were built on the upper Mississippi in the 1930s in addition to the three already in existence.\n\n\n\n![](image)Formation of the Atchafalaya River and construction of the Old River Control Structure.\n![](image)Project design flood flow capacity for the Mississippi river in thousands of cubic feet per second.[72]\nUntil the 1950s, there was no dam below Lock and Dam 26 at Alton, Illinois. Chain of Rocks Lock (Lock and Dam No. 27), which consists of a low-water dam and an 8.4-mile-long (13.5 km) canal, was added in 1953, just below the confluence with the Missouri River, primarily to bypass a series of rock ledges at St. Louis. It also serves to protect the St. Louis city water intakes during times of low water.\n\n\nU.S. government scientists determined in the 1950s that the Mississippi River was starting to switch to the Atchafalaya River channel because of its much steeper path to the Gulf of Mexico. Eventually, the Atchafalaya River would capture the Mississippi River and become its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico, leaving New Orleans on a side channel. As a result, the U.S. Congress authorized a project called the Old River Control Structure, which has prevented the Mississippi River from leaving its current channel that drains into the Gulf via New Orleans.[73]\n\n\nBecause the large scale of high-energy water flow threatened to damage the structure, an auxiliary flow control station was built adjacent to the standing control station. This $300 million project was completed in 1986 by the Corps of Engineers. Beginning in the 1970s, the Corps applied hydrological transport models to analyze flood flow and water quality of the Mississippi. Dam 26 at Alton, Illinois, which had structural problems, was replaced by the Mel Price Lock and Dam in 1990. The original Lock and Dam 26 was demolished.\n\n\n\n![](image)Soldiers of the Missouri Army National Guard sandbag the River in Clarksville, Missouri, June 2008, following flooding.\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nThe Corps now actively creates and maintains spillways and floodways to divert periodic water surges into backwater channels and lakes, as well as route part of the Mississippi's flow into the Atchafalaya Basin and from there to the Gulf of Mexico, bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans. The main structures are the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway in Missouri; the Old River Control Structure and the Morganza Spillway in Louisiana, which direct excess water down the west and east sides (respectively) of the Atchafalaya River; and the Bonnet Carré Spillway, also in Louisiana, which directs floodwaters to Lake Pontchartrain (see diagram). Some experts blame urban sprawl for increases in both the risk and frequency of flooding on the Mississippi River.[74]\n\n\nSome of the pre-1927 strategy remains in use today, with the Corps actively cutting the necks of horseshoe bends, allowing the water to move faster and reducing flood heights.[75]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nApproximately 50,000 years ago, the Central United States was covered by an inland sea, which was drained by the Mississippi and its tributaries into the Gulf of Mexico—creating large floodplains and extending the continent further to the south in the process. The soil in areas such as Louisiana was thereafter found to be very rich.[76]\n\n\n\n### Native Americans[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Woodland period, Hopewell tradition, and Mississippian culture\n\nThe area of the Mississippi River basin was first settled by hunting and gathering Native American peoples and is considered one of the few independent centers of plant domestication in human history.[77] Evidence of early cultivation of sunflower, a goosefoot, a marsh elder and an indigenous squash dates to the 4th millennium BC. The lifestyle gradually became more settled after around 1000 BC during what is now called the Woodland period, with increasing evidence of shelter construction, pottery, weaving and other practices.\n\n\nA network of trade routes referred to as the Hopewell interaction sphere was active along the waterways between about 200 and 500 AD, spreading common cultural practices over the entire area between the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes. A period of more isolated communities followed, and agriculture introduced from Mesoamerica based on the Three Sisters (maize, beans and squash) gradually came to dominate. After around 800 AD there arose an advanced agricultural society today referred to as the Mississippian culture, with evidence of highly stratified complex chiefdoms and large population centers.\n\n\nThe most prominent of these, now called Cahokia, was occupied between about 600 and 1400 AD[78] and at its peak numbered between 8,000 and 40,000 inhabitants, larger than London, England of that time. At the time of first contact with Europeans, Cahokia and many other Mississippian cities had dispersed, and archaeological finds attest to increased social stress.[79][80][81]\n\n\nModern American Indian nations inhabiting the Mississippi basin include Cheyenne, Sioux, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, Ho-Chunk, Fox, Kickapoo, Tamaroa, Moingwena, Quapaw and Chickasaw.\n\n\nThe word *Mississippi* itself comes from *Messipi*, the French rendering of the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe or Algonquin) name for the river, *Misi-ziibi* (Great River).[82][83] The Ojibwe called Lake Itasca *Omashkoozo-zaaga'igan* (Elk Lake) and the river flowing out of it *Omashkoozo-ziibi* (Elk River). After flowing into Lake Bemidji, the Ojibwe called the river *Bemijigamaag-ziibi* (River from the Traversing Lake). After flowing into Cass Lake, the name of the river changes to *Gaa-miskwaawaakokaag-ziibi* (Red Cedar River) and then out of Lake Winnibigoshish as *Wiinibiigoonzhish-ziibi* (Miserable Wretched Dirty Water River), *Gichi-ziibi* (Big River) after the confluence with the Leech Lake River, then finally as *Misi-ziibi* (Great River) after the confluence with the Crow Wing River.[84] After the expeditions by Giacomo Beltrami and Henry Schoolcraft, the longest stream above the juncture of the Crow Wing River and *Gichi-ziibi* was named \"Mississippi River\". The Mississippi River Band of Chippewa Indians, known as the *Gichi-ziibiwininiwag*, are named after the stretch of the Mississippi River known as the *Gichi-ziibi*. The Cheyenne, one of the earliest inhabitants of the upper Mississippi River, called it the *Máʼxe-éʼometaaʼe* (Big Greasy River) in the Cheyenne language. The Arapaho name for the river is *Beesniicíe*.[85] The Pawnee name is *Kickaátit*.[86]\n\n\nThe Mississippi was spelled Mississipi or Missisipi during French Louisiana and was also known as the Rivière Saint-Louis.[87][88][89]\n\n\n\n### European exploration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Discovery of the Mississippi by De Soto A.D. 1541* by William Henry Powell depicts Hernando de Soto and Spanish Conquistadores seeing the Mississippi River for the first time.\n![](image)Map of the French settlements (blue) in North America in 1750, before the French and Indian War (1754 to 1763).\n![](image)c. 1681 map of Marquette and Jolliet's 1673 expedition.\n![](image)Route of the Marquette-Jolliete Expedition of 1673\nIn 1519 Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda became the first recorded European to reach the Mississippi River, followed by Hernando de Soto who reached the river on May 8, 1541, and called it *Río del Espíritu Santo* (\"River of the Holy Spirit\"), in the area of what is now Mississippi.[90] In Spanish, the river is called *Río Mississippi*.[91]\n\n\nFrench explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette began exploring the Mississippi in the 17th century. Marquette traveled with a Sioux Indian who named it *Ne Tongo* (\"Big river\" in Sioux language) in 1673. Marquette proposed calling it the *River of the Immaculate Conception*.\n\n\nWhen Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi Valley in the 17th century, natives guided him to a quicker way to return to French Canada via the Illinois River. When he found the Chicago Portage, he remarked that a canal of \"only half a league\" (less than 2 miles or 3 kilometers) would join the Mississippi and the Great Lakes.[92] In 1848, the continental divide separating the waters of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley was breached by the Illinois and Michigan canal via the Chicago River.[93] This both accelerated the development, and forever changed the ecology of the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes.\n\n\nIn 1682, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti claimed the entire Mississippi River valley for France, calling the river *Colbert River* after Jean-Baptiste Colbert and the region *La Louisiane*, for King Louis XIV. On March 2, 1699, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville rediscovered the mouth of the Mississippi, following the death of La Salle.[94] The French built the small fort of La Balise there to control passage.[95]\n\n\nIn 1718, about 100 miles (160 km) upriver, New Orleans was established along the river crescent by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, with construction patterned after the 1711 resettlement on Mobile Bay of Mobile, the capital of French Louisiana at the time.\n\n\nIn 1727, Étienne Perier begins work, using enslaved African laborers, on the first levees on the Mississippi River.\n\n\n\n### Colonization[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Flood of 1851\n\n![](image)*A Home on the Mississippi* (1871)\nFollowing Britain's victory in the Seven Years War, the Mississippi became the border between the British and Spanish Empires. The Treaty of Paris (1763) gave Great Britain rights to all land east of the Mississippi and Spain rights to land west of the Mississippi. Spain also ceded Florida to Britain to regain Cuba, which the British occupied during the war. Britain then divided the territory into East and West Florida.\n\n\nArticle 8 of the Treaty of Paris (1783) states, \"The navigation of the river Mississippi, from its source to the ocean, shall forever remain free and open to the subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States\". With this treaty, which ended the American Revolutionary War, Britain also ceded West Florida back to Spain to regain the Bahamas, which Spain had occupied during the war. Initial disputes around the ensuing claims of the U.S. and Spain were resolved when Spain was pressured into signing Pinckney's Treaty in 1795. However, in 1800, under duress from Napoleon of France, Spain ceded an undefined portion of West Florida to France in the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso. The United States then secured effective control of the river when it bought the Louisiana Territory from France in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. This triggered a dispute between Spain and the U.S. on which parts of West Florida Spain had ceded to France in the first place, which would decide which parts of West Florida the U.S. had bought from France in the Louisiana Purchase, versus which were unceded Spanish property. Due to ongoing U.S. colonization creating facts on the ground, and U.S. military actions, Spain ceded both West and East Florida in their entirety to the United States in the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819.\n\n\nThe last serious European challenge to U.S. control of the river came at the conclusion of the War of 1812, when British forces mounted an attack on New Orleans just 15 days after the signing of the Treaty of Ghent. The attack was repulsed by an American army under the command of General Andrew Jackson.\n\n\nIn the Treaty of 1818, the U.S. and Great Britain agreed to fix the border running from the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains along the 49th parallel north. In effect, the U.S. ceded the northwestern extremity of the Mississippi basin to the British in exchange for the southern portion of the Red River basin.\n\n\nSo many settlers traveled westward through the Mississippi river basin, as well as settled in it, that Zadok Cramer wrote a guidebook called *The Navigator*, detailing the features, dangers, and navigable waterways of the area. It was so popular that he updated and expanded it through 12 editions over 25 years.\n\n\n\n![](image)Shifting sand bars made early navigation difficult.\nThe colonization of the area was barely slowed by the three earthquakes in 1811 and 1812, estimated at 8 on the Richter magnitude scale, that were centered near New Madrid, Missouri.\n\n\n\n### Steamboat era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Steamboats of the Mississippi\n\nMark Twain's book, *Life on the Mississippi*, covered the steamboat commerce, which took place from 1830 to 1870, before more modern ships replaced the steamer. *Harper's Weekly* first published the book as a seven-part serial in 1875. James R. Osgood & Company published the full version, including a passage from the then unfinished *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* and works from other authors, in 1885.\n\n\nThe first steamboat to travel the full length of the Lower Mississippi from the Ohio River to New Orleans was the *New Orleans* in December 1811. Its maiden voyage occurred during the series of New Madrid earthquakes in 1811–12. The Upper Mississippi was treacherous, unpredictable and to make traveling worse, the area was not properly mapped out or surveyed. Until the 1840s, only two trips a year to the Twin Cities landings were made by steamboats, which suggests it was not very profitable.[96]\n\n\nSteamboat transport remained a viable industry, both in terms of passengers and freight, until the end of the first decade of the 20th century. Among the several Mississippi River system steamboat companies was the noted Anchor Line, which, from 1859 to 1898, operated a luxurious fleet of steamers between St. Louis and New Orleans.\n\n\nItalian explorer Giacomo Beltrami wrote about his journey on the *Virginia*, which was the first steamboat to make it to Fort St. Anthony in Minnesota. He referred to his voyage as a promenade that was once a journey on the Mississippi. The steamboat era changed the economic and political life of the Mississippi, as well as of travel itself. The Mississippi was completely changed by the steamboat era as it transformed into a flourishing tourist trade.[97]\n\n\n\n### Civil War[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mississippi River in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)Battle of Vicksburg (ca. 1888)\n![](image)Mississippi River from Eunice, Arkansas, a settlement destroyed by gunboats during the Civil War.\nControl of the river was a strategic objective of both sides in the American Civil War, forming a part of the U.S. Anaconda Plan. In 1862, Union forces coming down the river successfully cleared Confederate defenses at Island Number 10 and Memphis, Tennessee, while Naval forces coming upriver from the Gulf of Mexico captured New Orleans, Louisiana. One of the last major Confederate strongholds was on the heights overlooking the river at Vicksburg, Mississippi; the Union's Vicksburg Campaign (December 1862–July 1863), and the fall of Port Hudson, completed control of the lower Mississippi River. The Union victory ended the Siege of Vicksburg on July 4, 1863, and was pivotal to the Union's final victory of the Civil War.\n\n\n\n### 20th and 21st centuries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Mississippi River floods\n\nThe \"Big Freeze\" of 1918–19 blocked river traffic north of Memphis, Tennessee, preventing transportation of coal from southern Illinois. This resulted in widespread shortages, high prices, and rationing of coal in January and February.[98]\n\n\nIn the spring of 1927, the river broke out of its banks in 145 places, during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and inundated 27,000 sq mi (70,000 km2) to a depth of up to 30 feet (9.1 m).\n\n\nIn 1930, Fred Newton was the first person to swim the length of the river, from Minneapolis to New Orleans. The journey took 176 days and covered 1,836 miles.[99][100]\n\n\nIn 1962 and 1963, industrial accidents spilled 3.5 million US gallons (13,000 m3) of soybean oil into the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers. The oil covered the Mississippi River from St. Paul to Lake Pepin, creating an ecological disaster and a demand to control water pollution.[101]\n\n\nOn October 20, 1976, the automobile ferry, *MV George Prince*, was struck by a ship traveling upstream as the ferry attempted to cross from Destrehan, Louisiana, to Luling, Louisiana. Seventy-eight passengers and crew died; only eighteen survived the accident.\n\n\nIn 1988, the water level of the Mississippi fell to 10 feet (3.0 m) below zero on the Memphis gauge. The remains of wooden-hulled water craft were exposed in an area of 4.5 acres (1.8 ha) on the bottom of the Mississippi River at West Memphis, Arkansas. They dated to the late 19th to early 20th centuries. The State of Arkansas, the Arkansas Archeological Survey, and the Arkansas Archeological Society responded with a two-month data recovery effort. The fieldwork received national media attention as good news in the middle of a drought.[102]\n\n\nThe Great Flood of 1993 was another significant flood, primarily affecting the Mississippi above its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois.\n\n\nTwo portions of the Mississippi were designated as American Heritage Rivers in 1997: the lower portion around Louisiana and Tennessee, and the upper portion around Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin. The Nature Conservancy's project called \"America's Rivershed Initiative\" announced a 'report card' assessment of the entire basin in October 2015 and gave the grade of D+. The assessment noted the aging navigation and flood control infrastructure along with multiple environmental problems.[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Campsite at the river in Arkansas\nIn 2002, Slovenian long-distance swimmer Martin Strel swam the entire length of the river, from Minnesota to Louisiana, over the course of 68 days. In 2005, the Source to Sea Expedition[104] paddled the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers to benefit the Audubon Society's Upper Mississippi River Campaign.[105][106]\n\n\n\n### Future[edit]\n\n\nGeologists believe that the lower Mississippi could take a new course to the Gulf. Either of two new routes—through the Atchafalaya Basin or through Lake Pontchartrain—might become the Mississippi's main channel if flood-control structures are overtopped or heavily damaged during a severe flood.[107][108][109][110][111]\n\n\nFailure of the Old River Control Structure, the Morganza Spillway, or nearby levees would likely re-route the main channel of the Mississippi through Louisiana's Atchafalaya Basin and down the Atchafalaya River to reach the Gulf of Mexico south of Morgan City in southern Louisiana. This route provides a more direct path to the Gulf of Mexico than the present Mississippi River channel through Baton Rouge and New Orleans.[109] While the risk of such a diversion is present during any major flood event, such a change has so far been prevented by active human intervention involving the construction, maintenance, and operation of various levees, spillways, and other control structures by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Old River Control Structure complex. View is to the east-southeast, looking downriver on the Mississippi, with the three dams across channels of the Atchafalaya River to the right of the Mississippi. Concordia Parish, Louisiana is in the foreground, on the right, and Wilkinson County, Mississippi, is in the background, across the Mississippi on the left.\nThe Old River Control Structure, between the present Mississippi River channel and the Atchafalaya Basin, sits at the normal water elevation and is ordinarily used to divert 30% of the Mississippi flow to the Atchafalaya River. There is a steep drop here away from the Mississippi's main channel into the Atchafalaya Basin. If this facility were to fail during a major flood, there is a strong concern the water would scour and erode the river bottom enough to capture the Mississippi's main channel. The structure was nearly lost during the 1973 flood, but repairs and improvements were made after engineers studied the forces at play. In particular, the Corps of Engineers made many improvements and constructed additional facilities for routing water through the vicinity. These additional facilities give the Corps much more flexibility and potential flow capacity than they had in 1973, which further reduces the risk of a catastrophic failure in this area during other major floods, such as that of 2011.\n\n\nBecause the Morganza Spillway is slightly higher and well back from the river, it is normally dry on both sides.[112] Even if it failed at the crest during a severe flood, the floodwaters would have to erode to normal water levels before the Mississippi could permanently jump channel at this location.[113][114] During the 2011 floods, the Corps of Engineers opened the Morganza Spillway to 1/4 of its capacity to allow 150,000 cubic feet per second (4,200 m3/s) of water to flood the Morganza and Atchafalaya floodways and continue directly to the Gulf of Mexico, bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans.[115] In addition to reducing the Mississippi River crest downstream, this diversion reduced the chances of a channel change by reducing stress on the other elements of the control system.[116]\n\n\nSome geologists have noted that the possibility for course change into the Atchafalaya also exists in the area immediately north of the Old River Control Structure. Army Corps of Engineers geologist Fred Smith once stated, \"The Mississippi wants to go west. 1973 was a forty-year flood. The big one lies out there somewhere—when the structures can't release all the floodwaters and the levee is going to have to give way. That is when the river's going to jump its banks and try to break through.\"[117]\n\n\nAnother possible course change for the Mississippi River is a diversion into Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans. This route is controlled by the Bonnet Carré Spillway, built to reduce flooding in New Orleans. This spillway and an imperfect natural levee about 12–20 ft (3.7–6.1 m) high are all that prevents the Mississippi from taking a new, shorter course through Lake Pontchartrain to the Gulf of Mexico.[118] Diversion of the Mississippi's main channel through Lake Pontchartrain would have consequences similar to an Atchafalaya diversion, but to a lesser extent, since the present river channel would remain in use past Baton Rouge and into the New Orleans area.\n\n\n\n## Recreation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Great River Road in Wisconsin near Lake Pepin (2005)\nThe sport of water skiing was invented on the river in a wide region between Minnesota and Wisconsin known as Lake Pepin.[119] Ralph Samuelson of Lake City, Minnesota, created and refined his skiing technique in late June and early July 1922. He later performed the first water ski jump in 1925 and was pulled along at 80 mph (130 km/h) by a Curtiss flying boat later that year.[119]\n\n\nThere are seven National Park Service sites along the Mississippi River. The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area is the National Park Service site dedicated to protecting and interpreting the Mississippi River itself. The other six National Park Service sites along the river are (listed from north to south):\n\n\n\n* Effigy Mounds National Monument\n* Gateway Arch National Park (includes Gateway Arch)\n* Vicksburg National Military Park\n* Natchez National Historical Park\n* New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park\n* Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mississippi River System § Ecology\n\n![](image)The American paddlefish is an ancient relict from the Mississippi\nThe Mississippi basin is home to a highly diverse aquatic fauna and has been called the \"mother fauna\" of North American freshwater.[120]\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\nAbout 375 fish species are known from the Mississippi basin, far exceeding other North Hemisphere river basins exclusively within temperate/subtropical regions,[120] except the Yangtze.[121] Within the Mississippi basin, streams that have their source in the Appalachian and Ozark highlands contain especially many species. Among the fish species in the basin are numerous endemics, as well as relicts such as paddlefish, sturgeon, gar and bowfin.[120]\n\n\nBecause of its size and high species diversity, the Mississippi basin is often divided into subregions. The Upper Mississippi River alone is home to about 120 fish species, including walleye, sauger, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, white bass, northern pike, bluegill, crappie, channel catfish, flathead catfish, common shiner, freshwater drum, and shovelnose sturgeon.[122][123]\n\n\n\n### Other fauna[edit]\n\n\nA large number of reptiles are native to the river channels and basin, including American alligators, several species of turtle, aquatic amphibians,[124] and cambaridae crayfish, are native to the Mississippi basin.[125]\n\n\nIn addition, approximately 40% of the migratory birds in the US use the Mississippi River corridor during Spring and Fall migrations; 60% of all migratory birds in North America (326 species) use the river basin as their flyway.[126]\n\n\n\n### Introduced species[edit]\n\n\nNumerous introduced species are found in the Mississippi and some of these are invasive. Among the introductions are fish such as Asian carp, including the silver carp that have become infamous for out-competing native fish and their potentially dangerous jumping behavior. They have spread throughout much of the basin, even approaching (but not yet invading) the Great Lakes.[127] The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has designated much of the Mississippi River in the state as infested waters by the exotic species zebra mussels and Eurasian watermilfoil.[128]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Atchafalaya Basin\n* Capes on the Mississippi River\n* Chemetco\n* Great River Road\n* List of crossings of the Lower Mississippi River\n* List of crossings of the Upper Mississippi River\n* List of locks and dams of the Upper Mississippi River\n* List of tributaries of the Mississippi River\n* List of longest rivers of the United States (by main stem)\n* Mississippi embayment\n* Mississippi River floods\n* Mississippi River System\n* *The Waterways Journal Weekly*\n* Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Ojibwe: Misi-ziibi,[8] Dakota: Mníšošethąka,[9] Myaamia: Mihsi-siipiiwi,[10] Cheyenne: Ma'xeé'ometāā'e,[11] Kiowa: Xósáu,[12] Arapaho: Beesniicie,[13] Pawnee: Kickaátit[14]\n2. **^** Arguably, the Mississippi basin is the second-largest drainage system in North America, second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system, although Hudson Bay may rather be considered an arm of the ocean.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** James L.

The Yenisey divides the Western Siberian Plain in the west from the Central Siberian Plateau to the east; it drains a large part of central Siberia.\n\n\nIt is the central one of three large Siberian rivers that flow into the Arctic Ocean (the other two being the Ob and the Lena). The maximum depth of the Yenisey is 61 metres (200 ft) and the average depth is 14 metres (45 ft).\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map including the Yenisey River\nThe Yenisey proper, from the confluence of its source rivers Great Yenisey and Little Yenisey at Kyzyl to its mouth in the Kara Sea, is 3,487 km (2,167 mi) long. From the source of its tributary Selenga, it is 5,075 km (3,153 mi) long.[10] It has a drainage basin of 2,580,000 km2 (1,000,000 sq mi).[11] The Yenisey flows through the Russian federal subjects Tuva, Khakassia[*citation needed*] and Krasnoyarsk Krai. The city of Krasnoyarsk is situated on the Yenisey.[12]\n\n\n\n### Tributaries[edit]\n\n\nThe largest tributaries of the Yenisey are, from source to mouth:[11][13]\n\n\n\n* Little Yenisey (left)\n* Great Yenisey (right)\n* Khemchik (left)\n* Kantegir (left)\n* Abakan (left)\n* Tuba (right)\n* Mana (right)\n* Bazaikha (right)\n* Kacha (left)\n* Kan (right)\n* Angara (right)\n* Kem (left)\n* Bolshoy Pit (right)\n* Sym (left)\n* Dubches (left)\n* Podkamennaya Tunguska (right)\n* Bakhta (right)\n* Yeloguy (left)\n* Nizhnyaya Tunguska (right)\n* Turukhan (left)\n* Kureyka (right)\n* Khantayka (right)\n* Bolshaya Kheta (left)\n* Tanama (left)\n\n## Lake Baikal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lake Baikal\n\nA significant feature of the Upper Yenisei is Lake Baikal, the deepest and oldest lake in the world.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)The river flowing through the Shushensky Forest\n## Brekhovskie Islands[edit]\n\n\nThe Brekhovskie Islands (Russian-language article: *Бреховские острова*) lie in the Yenisey estuary and have an area of some 1,400,000 hectares. They provide a wetland habitat for rare and endangered birds and are an internationally important nesting and breeding area for several types of waterfowl.[15] The most north-easterly of the islands, Nosonovskij Ostrov (\"Nose Island\") was visited by Fridtjof Nansen in 1913.[16]\n\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nThe Yenisey basin (excluding Lake Baikal and lakes of the Khantayka headwaters) is home to 55 native fish species, including two endemics: *Gobio sibiricus* (a gobionine cyprinid) and *Thymallus nigrescens* (a grayling).[17] The grayling is restricted to Khövsgöl Nuur and its tributaries.[17] Most fish found in the Yenisey basin are relatively widespread Euro-Siberian or Siberian species, such as northern pike (*Esox lucius*), common roach (*Rutilus rutilus*), common dace (*Leuciscus leuciscus*), Siberian sculpin (*Cottus poecilopus*), European perch (*Perca fluviatilis*) and Prussian carp (*Carassius gibelio*). The basin is also home to many salmonids (trout, whitefish, charr, graylings, taimen and relatives) and the Siberian sturgeon (*Acipenser baerii*).[17]\n\n\nThe Yenisey valley is habitat for numerous flora and fauna, with Siberian pine and Siberian larch being notable tree species. In prehistoric times Scots pine, *Pinus sylvestris*, was abundant in the Yenisey valley c. 6000 BC.[18] There are also numerous bird species present in the watershed, including, for example, the hooded crow, *Corvus cornix*.[19]\n\n\n\n### Taimyr reindeer herd[edit]\n\n\nThe Taimyr herd of tundra reindeer (*Rangifer tarandus* *sibiricus*), the largest reindeer herd in the world,[20][21] migrates to winter grazing ranges along the Yenisey.[22]: 336 It had an estimated 800,000-850,000 individuals as of 2010, but has peaked at over one million.[23]\n\n\n\n## Navigation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Inclined plane at Krasnoyarsk Dam\nRiver steamers first came to the Yenisey River in 1864 and were brought in from Holland and England across the icy Kara Sea. One was the SS Nikolai. The SS Thames attempted to explore the river, overwintered in 1876, but was damaged in the ice and eventually wrecked in the river. Success came with the steamers Frazer, Express in 1878, and the next year, Moscow hauling supplies in and wheat out. The Dalman reached Yeniseisk in 1881.\n\n\nImperial Russia placed river steamers on the massive river in an attempt to free up communication with land-locked Siberia. One boat was the SS St. Nicholas which took the future Tsar Nicholas II on his voyage to Siberia, and later conveyed Vladimir Lenin to prison.\n\n\nEngineers attempted to place river steamers in regular service on the river during the building of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The boats were needed to bring in the rails, engines and supplies. Captain Joseph Wiggins sailed the Orestes with rail in 1893. However, the sea and river route proved very difficult with several ships lost at sea and on the river. Both the Ob and Yenisey mouths feed into very long inlets, several hundred kilometres in length, which are shallow, ice bound and prone to high winds and thus treacherous for navigation. After the completion of the railway, river traffic reduced only to local service as the Arctic route and long river proved much too indirect a route.\n\n\nThe first recreation team to navigate the Yenisey's entire length, including its violent upper tributary in Mongolia, was an Australian-Canadian effort completed in September 2001. Ben Kozel, Tim Cope, Colin Angus and Remy Quinter were on this team. Both Kozel and Angus wrote books detailing this expedition,[24] and a documentary was produced for National Geographic Television.\n\n\nA canal inclined plane was built on the river in 1985 at the Krasnoyarsk Dam.[25]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nNomadic tribes such as the Ket people and the Yugh people have lived along the banks of the Yenisey since ancient times, and this region is the location of the Yeniseian language family. The Ket, numbering about 1000, are the only survivors today of those who originally lived throughout central southern Siberia near the river banks. Their extinct relatives included the Kotts, Assans, Arins, Baikots and Pumpokols who lived further upriver to the south. The modern Ket lived in the eastern middle areas of the river before being assimilated politically into Russia during the 17th through 19th centuries.[26]\n\n\nSome of the earliest known evidence of Turkic origins was found in the Yenisey Valley in the form of stelae, stone monoliths and memorial tablets dating from between the seventh and ninth centuries AD, along with some documents that were found in China's Xinjiang region. The written evidence gathered from these sources tells of battles fought between the Turks and the Chinese and other legends. There are also examples of Uyghur poetry, though most have survived only in Chinese translation.[27]\n\n\nWheat from the Yenisey was sold by Muslims and Uighurs during inadequate harvests to Bukhara and Soghd during the Tahirid era.[28]\n\n\nRussians first reached the upper Yenisey in 1605, travelling from the Ob, up the Ket, portaging and then down the Yenisey as far as the Sym.[29]\n\n\nDuring World War II, Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire agreed to divide Asia along a line that followed the Yenisey to the border of China and then along the border of China and the Soviet Union.[30]\n\n\n\n## Pollution[edit]\n\n\nStudies have shown that the Yenisey suffers from contamination caused by radioactive discharges from a factory that produced bomb-grade plutonium in the secret city of Krasnoyarsk-26, now known as Zheleznogorsk.[31]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![The bridge over the Yenisey in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, viewed from the left bank.](image)\n\nThe bridge over the Yenisey in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, viewed from the left bank.\n* ![Vinogradovsky Most, the bridge in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, viewed from the left bank.](image)\n\nVinogradovsky Most, the bridge in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, viewed from the left bank.\n* ![The Yenisey (left) and the Ob flow into Kara Sea (south at top in this view).](image)\n\nThe Yenisey (left) and the Ob flow into Kara Sea (south at top in this view).\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Siberia portal\n\n\n* List of rivers of Russia\n* Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam\n* Yenisey Range\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Mongolian: Горлог мөрөн, *Gorlog mörön*, pronounced [ˈɢɔrɮɜ̆q ˈmɵrʉ̆ŋ]; Buryat: Горлог мүрэн, *Gorlog müren*; Tuvan: Улуг-Хем, *Ulug-Hem*; Khakas: *Ким суғ*, *Kim suğ*\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Прокофьев, Александр Андреевич (30 August 1990). *Избранное : стихотворения, поэмы*. \"Худож. лит-ра\", Ленинградское отд-ние.

'long river') is the longest river in Eurasia, the third-longest in the world, and the longest in the world to flow entirely within one country. It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows 6,300 km (3,915 mi) in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea.[8] It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world. Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China, and is home to nearly one-third of the country's population.[9]\n\n\nThe Yangtze has played a major role in the history, culture, and economy of China. For thousands of years, the river has been used for water, irrigation, sanitation, transportation, industry, boundary-marking, and war. The prosperous Yangtze Delta generates as much as 20% of China's GDP. The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world that is in use.[10][11] In mid-2014, the Chinese government announced it was building a multi-tier transport network, comprising railways, roads and airports, to create a new economic belt alongside the river.[12]\n\n\nThe Yangtze flows through a wide array of ecosystems and is habitat to several endemic and threatened species including the Chinese alligator, the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, and also was the home of the now extinct Yangtze river dolphin (or *baiji*) and Chinese paddlefish, as well as the Yangtze sturgeon, which is extinct in the wild. In recent years, the river has suffered from industrial pollution, plastic pollution,[13] agricultural runoff, siltation, and loss of wetland and lakes, which exacerbates seasonal flooding. Some sections of the river are now protected as nature reserves. A stretch of the upstream Yangtze flowing through deep gorges in western Yunnan is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n### Chinese[edit]\n\n\n*Cháng Jiāng* (长江; 長江) or \"**Long River**\" is the official name for the Yangtze in Mandarin Chinese. However, the Chinese have given different names to the upstream sections of the river up to its confluence with the Min River at Yibin, Sichuan.[14][15] Jinsha River (\"Gold Sands River\") refers to the 2,308 km (1,434 mi) of the Yangtze from Yibin upstream to the confluence with the Batang River near Yushu in Qinghai, while the Tongtian River (\"River that leads to Heaven\") describes the 813 km (505 mi) section from Yushu up to the confluence of the Tuotuo River and the Dangqu River.\n\n\nIn Old Chinese, the Yangtze was simply called *Jiang/Kiang* 江,[16] a character of phono-semantic compound origin, combining the water radical 氵 with the homophone 工 (now pronounced *gōng*, but *\\*kˤoŋ* in Old Chinese[17]). *Kong* was probably a word in the Austroasiatic language of local peoples such as the Yue. Similar to *\\*krong* in Proto-Vietnamese and *krung* in Mon, all meaning \"river\", it is related to modern Vietnamese *sông* (river) and Khmer *krung* (city on riverside), whence Thai *krung* (กรุง capital city), not *kôngkea* (water) which is from the Sanskrit root *gáṅgā*.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)The \"Great River\" (大江) with its entrance to the East China Sea marked as the \"Mouth of the Yangtze\" (揚子江口) on the Jiangnan map in the 1754 *Provincial Atlas of the Qing Empire*\nBy the Han dynasty, *Jiāng* had come to mean *any* river in Chinese, and this river was distinguished as the \"Great River\" 大江 (*Dàjiāng*). The epithet 長 (simplified version 长), means \"long\", was first formally applied to the river during the Six Dynasties period.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nVarious sections of the Yangtze have local names. From Yibin to Yichang, the river through Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality is also known as the *Chuān Jiāng* (川江) or \"Sichuan River.\" In Hubei, the river is also called the *Jīng Jiāng* (荆江; 荊江) or the \"Jing River\" after Jingzhou, one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China. In Anhui, the river takes on the local name *Wǎn Jiāng* after the shorthand name for Anhui, *wǎn* (皖). And *Yángzǐ Jiāng* (揚子江; 扬子江) or the \"Yangzi River\", from which the English name Yangtze is derived, is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of Yangzhou. The name likely comes from an ancient ferry crossing called *Yángzǐ* or *Yángzǐjīn* (揚子 / 揚子津).[19] Europeans who arrived in the Yangtze River Delta region applied this local name to the whole river.[14] The dividing site between upstream and midstream is considered to be at Yichang and that between midstream and downstream at Hukou (Jiujiang).[20]\n\n\n\n### English[edit]\n\n\n\nThe river was called **Quian** (江) and **Quianshui** (江水) by Marco Polo[21] and appeared on the earliest English maps as **Kian** or **Kiam**,[22][23] which derives from Cantonese, all recording dialects which preserved forms of the Middle Chinese pronunciation of 江 as *Kæwng*.[16] By the mid-19th century, these romanizations had standardized as **Kiang**; *Dajiang*, e.g., was rendered as \"Ta-Kiang.\" \"Keeang-Koo,\"[24] \"Kyang Kew,\"[25] \"Kian-ku,\"[26] and related names derived from mistaking the Chinese term for the mouth of the Yangtze (江口, p *Jiāngkǒu*) as the name of the river itself.\n\n\nThe name **Blue River** began to be applied in the 18th century,[22] apparently owing to a former name of the Dam Chu[28] or Min[30] and to analogy with the Yellow River,[31][32] but it was frequently explained in early English references as a 'translation' of *Jiang*,[33][34] *Jiangkou*,[24] or *Yangzijiang*.[35] Very common in 18th- and 19th-century sources, the name fell out of favor due to growing awareness of its lack of *any* connection to the river's Chinese names[36][37] and to the irony of its application to such a muddy waterway.[37][38]\n\n\nMatteo Ricci's 1615 Latin account included descriptions of the \"Ianſu\" and \"Ianſuchian.\"[39] The posthumous account's translation of the name as **Fils de la Mer** (\"Son of the Ocean\")[39][40] shows that Ricci, who by the end of his life was fluent in literary Chinese, was introduced to it as the homophonic 洋子江 rather than the usual 揚子江. Further, although railroads and the Shanghai concessions subsequently turned it into a backwater, **Yang**zhou was the lower river's principal port for much of the Qing dynasty, directing Liangjiang's important salt monopoly and connecting the Yangtze with the Grand Canal to Beijing. (That connection also made it one of the Yellow River's principal ports between the floods of 1344 and the 1850s, during which time the Yellow River ran well south of Shandong and discharged into the ocean a mere few hundred kilometers from the mouth of the Yangtze.[36][26])\n\n\nBy 1800, English cartographers such as Aaron Arrowsmith had adopted the French style of the name[41] as **Yang-tse** or **Yang-tse Kiang**.[42] The British diplomat Thomas Wade emended this to **Yang-tzu Chiang** as part of his formerly popular romanization of Chinese, based on the Beijing dialect instead of Nanjing's and first published in 1867. The spellings **Yangtze** and **Yangtze Kiang** was a compromise between the two methods adopted at the 1906 Imperial Postal Conference in Shanghai, which established postal romanization. Hanyu Pinyin was adopted by the PRC's First Congress in 1958, but it was not widely employed in English outside mainland China prior to the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the PRC in 1979; since that time, the spelling **Yangzi** has also been used.\n\n\n\n### Tibetan[edit]\n\n\n\nThe source and upper reaches of the Yangtze are located in ethnic Tibetan areas of Qinghai.[43] In Tibetan, the Tuotuo headwaters are the *Machu* (Tibetan: རྨ་ཆུ་, Wylie: *rma-chu*, lit. \"Red Water\"). The Tongtian is the *Drichu* (འབྲི་ཆུ་ , ‘Bri Chu’), literally \"Water of the Female Yak\"; transliterated into Chinese: 直曲; pinyin: *Zhíqū*).\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A topographical map of China depicting the Yangtze's steady course and the former route of the Yellow River south of Shandong to the Huai mouth, after its stabilization by the Grand Eunuch Li Xing's public works following the 1494 flood\nThe river originates from several tributaries in the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, two of which are commonly referred to as the \"source.\" Traditionally, the Chinese government has recognized the source as the Tuotuo tributary at the base of a glacier lying on the west of Geladandong Mountain in the Tanggula Mountains. This source is found at 33°25′44″N 91°10′57″E﻿ / ﻿33.42889°N 91.18250°E﻿ / 33.42889; 91.18250 and while not the furthest source of the Yangtze, it is the highest source at 5,342 m (17,526 ft) above sea level. The true source of the Yangtze, hydrologically the longest river distance from the sea, is at Jari Hill at the head of the Dam Qu tributary, approximately 325 km (202 mi) southeast of Geladandong.[44] This source was only discovered in the late 20th century and lies in wetlands at 32°36′14″N 94°30′44″E﻿ / ﻿32.60389°N 94.51222°E﻿ / 32.60389; 94.51222 and 5,170 m (16,960 ft) above sea level just southeast of Chadan Township in Zadoi County, Yushu Prefecture, Qinghai.[45] As the historical spiritual source of the Yangtze, the Geladandong source is still commonly referred to as the source of the Yangtze since the discovery of the Jari Hill source.[44]\n\n\nThese tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through Qinghai (Tsinghai), turning southward down a deep valley at the border of Sichuan (Szechwan) and Tibet to reach Yunnan. In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above 5,000 m (16,000 ft) to less than 1,000 m (3,300 ft). Thus, over the first 2,600 km (1,600 mi) of its length, the river has fallen more than 5,200 m (17,000 ft).[46]\n\n\nIt enters the basin of Sichuan at Yibin. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through Mount Wushan bordering Chongqing and Hubei to create the famous Three Gorges. Eastward of the Three Gorges, Yichang is the first city on the Yangtze Plain.\n\n\nAfter entering Hubei province, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi.\n\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi province, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai.\n\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.\n\n\nThe origin of the Yangtze River has been dated by some geologists to about 45 million years ago in the Eocene,[47] but this dating has been disputed.

Based on studies of sedimentation rates, however, it is unlikely that the present discharge site predates the late Miocene (c. 11 Ma).[51] Prior to this, its headwaters drained south into the Gulf of Tonkin along or near the course of the present Red River.[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Afternoon in the jagged mountains rising from the Yangtze River gorge\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Baiyue, state of Wu, state of Yue, state of Chu, Yangtze civilization, and Southward expansion of the Han Dynasty\n\nThe Yangtze River is important to the cultural origins of southern China and Japan.[53] Human activity has been verified in the Three Gorges area as far back as 27,000 years ago,[54] and by the 5th millennium BC, the lower Yangtze was a major population center occupied by the Hemudu and Majiabang cultures, both among the earliest cultivators of rice. By the 3rd millennium BC, the successor Liangzhu culture showed evidence of influence from the Longshan peoples of the North China Plain.[55] What is now thought of as Chinese culture developed along the more fertile Yellow River basin; the \"Yue\" people of the lower Yangtze possessed very different traditions – blackening their teeth, cutting their hair short, tattooing their bodies, and living in small settlements among bamboo groves[56] – and were considered barbarous by the northerners.\n\n\nThe Central Yangtze valley was home to sophisticated Neolithic cultures.[57] Later it became the earliest part of the Yangtze valley to be integrated into the North Chinese cultural sphere. (Northern Chinese were active there since the Bronze Age).[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of the Warring States around 350 BC, showing the former coastline of the Yangtze delta\nIn the lower Yangtze, two Yue tribes, the *Gouwu* in southern Jiangsu and the *Yuyue* in northern Zhejiang, display increasing Zhou (i.e., North Chinese) influence starting in the 9th century BC. Traditional accounts[59] credit these changes to northern refugees (Taibo and Zhongyong in Wu and Wuyi in Yue) who assumed power over the local tribes, though these are generally assumed to be myths invented to legitimate them to other Zhou rulers. As the kingdoms of Wu and Yue, they were famed as fishers, shipwrights, and sword-smiths. Adopting Chinese characters, political institutions, and military technology, they were among the most powerful states during the later Zhou. In the middle Yangtze, the state of Jing seems to have begun in the upper Han River valley a minor Zhou polity, but it adapted to native culture as it expanded south and east into the Yangtze valley. In the process, it changed its name to Chu.[60]\n\n\nWhether native or nativizing, the Yangtze states held their own against the northern Chinese homeland: some lists credit them with three of the Spring and Autumn period's Five Hegemons and one of the Warring States' Four Lords. They fell in against themselves, however. Chu's growing power led its rival Jin to support Wu as a counter. Wu successfully sacked Chu's capital Ying in 506 BC, but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu's southern flank. In 473 BC, King Goujian of Yue fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its eponymous capital at modern Suzhou. In 333 BC, Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue, whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the Minyue kingdom in Fujian. Qin was able to unite China by first subduing Ba and Shu on the upper Yangtze in modern Sichuan, giving them a strong base to attack Chu's settlements along the river.\n\n\nThe state of Qin conquered the central Yangtze region, previous heartland of Chu, in 278 BC, and incorporated the region into its expanding empire. Qin then used its connections along the Yangtze River the Xiang River to expand China into Hunan, Jiangxi and Guangdong, setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication. At the collapse of the Qin Dynasty, these southern commanderies became the independent Nanyue Empire under Zhao Tuo while Chu and Han vied with each other for control of the north.\n\n\nSince the Han dynasty, the region of the Yangtze River grew ever more important to China's economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is Dujiangyan, northwest of Chengdu, built during the Warring States period) made agriculture very stable and productive, eventually exceeding even the Yellow River region. The Qin and Han empires were actively engaged in the agricultural colonization of the Yangtze lowlands, maintaining a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods.[61] By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river. Early in the Qing dynasty, the region called Jiangnan (that includes the southern part of Jiangsu, the northern part of Zhejiang, and the southeastern part of Anhui) provided 1⁄3–1⁄2 of the nation's revenues.\n\n\nThe Yangtze has long been the backbone of China's inland water transportation system, which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years, until the construction of the national railway network during the 20th century. The Grand Canal connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the Jiangnan region south of the river (Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou) and with northern China (all the way from Yangzhou to Beijing). The less well known ancient Lingqu Canal, connecting the upper Xiang River with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the Pearl River Delta.[62]\n\n\nHistorically, the Yangtze became the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see History of China) because of the difficulty of crossing the river. This occurred notably during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the Southern Song. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD during the Three Kingdoms period.\n\n\nThe Yangtze was the site of naval battles between the Song dynasty and Jurchen Jin during the Jin–Song wars. In the Battle of Caishi of 1161, the ships of the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang clashed with the Song fleet on the Yangtze. Song soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulfur using trebuchets at the Jurchen warships. The battle was a Song victory that halted the invasion by the Jin.[63][64] The Battle of Tangdao was another Yangtze naval battle in the same year.\n\n\nPolitically, Nanjing was the capital of China several times, although most of the time its territory only covered the southeastern part of China, such as the Wu kingdom in the Three Kingdoms period, the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and during the Southern and Northern Dynasties and Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms periods. Only the Ming occupied most parts of China from their capital at Nanjing, though it later moved the capital to Beijing. The ROC capital was located in Nanjing in the periods 1911–12, 1927–37, and 1945–49.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n*Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River*, a Ming dynasty landscape painting\n\n### Age of steam[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China Station\n\nThe *Jardine*, the first steamship to sail the river, was built for Jardine, Matheson & Co. in 1835. This small vessel was to carry passengers and mail between Lintin Island, Macao, and Huangpu. However, the Chinese, draconian in their application of the rules relating to foreign vessels, were unhappy about a \"fire-ship\" steaming up the Canton River. The acting Viceroy of Liangguang issued an edict warning that she would be fired on if she attempted the trip.[65] On the *Jardine's* first trial run from Lintin Island the forts on both sides of the Bogue opened fire and she was forced to turn back. The Chinese authorities issued a further warning insisting that the ship leave Chinese waters. The *Jardine* in any case needed repairs and was sent to Singapore.[66]  \nSubsequently, Lord Palmerston, the Foreign Secretary decided mainly on the \"suggestions\" of William Jardine to declare war on China. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannonball fired at a British ship, the *Royal Saxon*, the British started the first of the Opium Wars. Royal Navy warships destroyed numerous shore batteries and Chinese warships, laying waste to several coastal forts along the way. Eventually, they pushed their way up north close enough to threaten the Imperial Palace in Beijing itself.[65]\n\n\nThe China Navigation Company was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after, and in 1883 a regular service to Australia was initiated.[65]\n\n\n\nYangtze River steam boats filmed in 1937\n![](image)USS *Luzon*\n### Navigation on the upper river[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yangtze in 1915\n![](image)Cruise boats on Yangtze\n![](image)A vehicle carrier on Yangtze\n![](image)A container carrier on Yangtze\nSteamers came late to the upper river, the section stretching from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But summer was better navigationally and the three gorges, described as a \"150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass,\" posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 – 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70–80 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver through some of the most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges.[67] Achibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the Chefoo Convention opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built *Kuling* but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes. *Kuling* was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service. In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade as long as it was restricted to native crafts. In 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade. Little took up residence in Chongqing and built *Leechuan*, to tackle the gorges in 1898. In March *Leechuan* completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers. *Leechuan* was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot.[68] In 1898, Little persuaded Captain Samuel Cornell Plant to come out to China to lend his expertise. Captain Plant had just completed navigation of Persia's Upper Karun River and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on *Leechuan* at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS *Pioneer* built with Plant in command. In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing. *Pioneer* was sold to Royal Navy after its first run due to threat from the Boxer Rebellion and renamed HMS *Kinsha*. Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS *Suixing* ended in catastrophe. On *Suixing's* maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze. In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing. Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS *Shutung* and SS *Shuhun*. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too. Plant was appointed by Chinese Maritime Customs Service as First Senior River Inspector in 1915. In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems. He also wrote *Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River*, a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction. Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze. Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield and Swire and Standard Oil added their own steamers on the river between 1917 and 1919. Between 1918 and 1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business.[69] *Shutung* was commandeered by warlords and *Shuhun* was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping.[70] In 1921, when Captain Plant died at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation. The largest shipping companies in service, Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, Mackenzie & Co., Asiatic Petroleum, Robert Dollar, China Merchants S.N. Co. and British-American Tobacco Co., contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots. In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners. One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English. Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.[71][72]\n\n\nStandard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were collectively destroyed on December 12, 1937, when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.[73]\n\n\n\n### Navy ships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Imperial Japanese Navy armored cruiser *Izumo* in Shanghai in 1937. She sank riverboats on the Yangtze in 1941.\nSee also: USS Asheville (PG-21), Yangtze Patrol, and Yangtze Incident\n\n### Contemporary events[edit]\n\n\nChinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong took staged swims in the river in 1956 and 1966 at Wuhan in publicity stunts to demonstrate his health, also starting a swimming craze through party propaganda.[74][75]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Welsh adventurer Ash Dykes became the first person to complete the 4,000-mile (6,437 km) trek along the course of the river, walking for 352 days from its source to its mouth.[76]\n\n\n\n## Hydrology[edit]\n\n\n### Periodic floods[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of deadliest floods\n\nTens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes. The floods large enough to overflow the dikes have caused great distress to those who live and farm there. Floods of note include those of 1931, 1954, and 1998.\n\n\nThe 1931 Central China floods or the Central China floods of 1931 were a series of floods that occurred in the Republic of China. The floods are generally considered among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted). Estimates of the total death toll range from 145,000 to between 3.7 million and 4 million.[77][78] The Yangtze again flooded in 1935, causing great loss of life.\n\n\nFrom June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\n\nThe 1998 Yangtze River floods were a series of major floods that lasted from middle of June to the beginning of September 1998 along the Yangtze.[79]\nIn the summer of 1998, China experienced massive flooding of parts of the Yangtze River, resulting in 3,704 dead, 15 million homeless and $26 billion in economic loss.[80] Other sources report a total loss of 4150 people, and 180 million people were affected.[81] A staggering 25 million acres (100,000 km2) were evacuated, 13.3 million houses were damaged or destroyed. The floods caused $26 billion in damages.[81]\n\n\nThe 2016 China floods caused US$22 billion in damages.\n\n\nIn 2020, the Yangtze river saw the heaviest rainfall since 1961, with a 79% increase in June and July compared to the average for the period over the previous 41 years. A new theory suggested that abrupt reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, caused by shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, was a key cause of the intense downpours. Over the past decades rainfall had decreased due to increase of aerosols in the atmosphere, and lower greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 caused the opposite effect – a major increase in rain. Such a dramatic reduction of aerosols caused a dramatic change in the various components of the climate system, but such sudden change of the climate system would be very different from changes in response to continuous but gradual policy-driven emissions reductions.[82]\n\n\n\n### Degradation of the river[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Water resources in China § Water quality\n\n![](image)Barges on the river\nBeginning in the 1950s, dams and dikes were built for flood control, land reclamation, irrigation, and control of diseases vectors such as blood flukes that caused Schistosomiasis. More than a hundred lakes were thusly cut off from the main river.[83] There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction.[84] Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, Baidang Lake shrunk from 100 square kilometers (39 sq mi) in the 1950s to 40 square kilometers (15 sq mi) in 2005. Zhangdu Lake dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of carp who thrived in eutrophic water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage.[83][85] In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution.[86] The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable \"iron barrier\" that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the baiji dolphin, narrow-ridged finless porpoise and the Yangtze alligator. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.[87]\n\n\nIn 2020, a sweeping law was passed by the Chinese government to protect the ecology of the river. The new laws include strengthening ecological protection rules for hydropower projects along the river, banning chemical plants within 1 kilometer of the river, relocating polluting industries, severely restricting sand mining as well as a complete fishing ban on all the natural waterways of the river, including all its major tributaries and lakes.[88]\n\n\n\n### Contribution to ocean pollution[edit]\n\n\nThe Yangtze River produces more ocean plastic pollution than any other, according to The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch environmental research foundation that focuses on ocean pollution. 10 Rivers transport 90% of all the plastic that reaches the oceans, the Yangtze river being the biggest polluter by far.[89][90]\n\n\n\n### Reconnecting lakes[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002 a pilot program was initiated to reconnect lakes to the Yangtze with the objective to increase biodiversity and to alleviate flooding. The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were Zhangdu Lake, Honghu Lake, and Tian'e-Zhou in Hubei on the middle Yangtze. In 2005 Baidang Lake in Anhui was also reconnected.[85]\n\n\nReconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake, replenishing their numbers and genetic stock. The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding. The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically. Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed, which helped them breed better-quality fish that can be sold for more, increasing their income by 30%. Based on the successful pilot project, other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river. In 2005 a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together 13 riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea.[91] In 2006 China's Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes. As of 2010, provincial governments in five provinces and Shanghai set up a network of 40 effective protected areas, covering 16,500 km2 (6,400 sq mi). As a result, populations of 47 threatened species increased, including the critically endangered Yangtze alligator. In the Shanghai area, reestablished wetlands now protect drinking water sources for the city. It is envisaged to extend the network throughout the entire Yangtze to eventually cover 102 areas and 185,000 km2 (71,000 sq mi). The mayor of Wuhan announced that six huge, stagnating urban lakes including the East Lake (Wuhan) would be reconnected at the cost of US$2.3 billion creating China's largest urban wetland landscape.[83][92]\n\n\n\n## Major cities along the river[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Populated places on the Yangtze River\n\n![](image)Map of the Yangtze river (facing west) showing the major settlements along its banks\n* Yushu\n* Panzhihua\n* Yibin\n* Luzhou\n* Hejiang\n* Chongqing\n* Fuling\n* Fengdu\n* Wanzhou\n* Yichang\n* Yidu\n* Jingzhou\n* Shashi\n* Shishou\n* Yueyang\n* Xianning\n* Wuhan\n* Ezhou\n* Huangshi\n* Huanggang\n* Chaohu\n* Chizhou\n* Jiujiang\n* Anqing\n* Tongling\n* Wuhu\n* Chuzhou\n* Ma'anshan\n* Taizhou\n* Yangzhou\n* Zhenjiang\n* Nanjing\n* Changzhou\n* Nantong\n* Shanghai\n\n## Crossings[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bridges and tunnels across the Yangtze River and Yangtze River power line crossings\n\n**Map all coordinates in \"Yangtze River bridges and tunnels\" using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\nUntil 1957, there were no bridges across the Yangtze River from Yibin to Shanghai. For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry. On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the *Zhong'anlun* disaster (October 15, 1945).\n\n\nThe river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China. In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at Hanyang and Pukou, and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from Wuchang or Nanjing West.\n\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, a dual-use road-rail bridge, built from 1955 to 1957. It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River. The second bridge across the river that was built was a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959. The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in Nanjing. It was built after the Sino-Soviet Split and did not receive foreign assistance. Road-rail bridges were then built in Zhicheng (1971) and Chongqing (1980).\n\n\nBridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century. The Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge was built in 1992 as part of the Beijing-Jiujiang Railway. A second bridge in Wuhan was completed in 1995. By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai. These include some of the longest suspension and cable-stayed bridges in the world on the Yangtze Delta: Jiangyin Suspension Bridge (1,385 m, opened in 1999), Runyang Bridge (1,490 m, opened 2005), Sutong Bridge (1,088 m, opened 2008). The rapid pace of bridge construction has continued. The city of Wuhan now has six bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze.\n\n\nA number of power line crossings have also been built across the river.\n\n\n\n* ![Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the first bridge crossing Yangtze, was completed in 1957.](image)\n\nWuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the first bridge crossing Yangtze, was completed in 1957.\n* ![The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, a beam bridge, was completed in 1968.](image)\n\nThe Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, a beam bridge, was completed in 1968.\n* ![The Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge, an arch bridge, was completed in 1992.](image)\n\nThe Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge, an arch bridge, was completed in 1992.\n* ![The Yichang Yangtze Highway Bridge, a suspension bridge near the Gezhouba Dam lock, was completed in 1996.](image)\n\nThe Yichang Yangtze Highway Bridge, a suspension bridge near the Gezhouba Dam lock, was completed in 1996.\n* ![The Sutong Yangtze River Bridge, between Nantong and Suzhou, was one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in the world when it was completed in 2008.](image)\n\nThe Sutong Yangtze River Bridge, between Nantong and Suzhou, was one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in the world when it was completed in 2008.\n* ![The Caiyuanba Bridge, an arch bridge in Chongqing, was completed in 2007.](image)\n\nThe Caiyuanba Bridge, an arch bridge in Chongqing, was completed in 2007.\n* ![The cable-stayed Anqing Yangtze River Bridge at Anqing, was completed in 2005.](image)\n\nThe cable-stayed Anqing Yangtze River Bridge at Anqing, was completed in 2005.\n* ![Wuhan Metro Line 2 is the first underground rail line crossing the Yangtze River.](image)\n\nWuhan Metro Line 2 is the first underground rail line crossing the Yangtze River.\n\n\n## Dams[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Three Gorges Dam in 2006\n![](image)Diagram showing dams planned for the upper reaches of the Yangtze River\nAs of 2007, there are two dams built on the Yangtze river: Three Gorges Dam and Gezhouba Dam. The Three Gorges Dam is the largest power station in the world by installed capacity, at 22.5 GW. Several dams are operating or are being constructed on the upper portion of the river, the Jinsha River. Among them, the Xiluodu Dam is the third largest power station in the world, and the Baihetan Dam, planned to be commissioned in 2021, will be the second largest after the Three Gorges Dam.\n\n\n\n## Tributaries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A shipyard on the banks of the Yangtze building commercial river freight boats\nThe Yangtze River has over 700 tributaries. The major tributaries (listed from upstream to downstream) with the locations of where they join the Yangtze are:\n\n\n\n* Yalong River (Panzhihua, Sichuan)\n* Min River (Yibin, Sichuan)\n* Tuo River (Luzhou, Sichuan)\n* Chishui River (Hejiang, Sichuan)\n* Jialing River (Chongqing)\n* Wu River (Fuling, Chongqing)\n* Qing River (Yidu, Hubei)\n* Yuan River (via Dongting Lake)\n* Lishui River (via Dongting Lake)\n* Zi River (via Dongting Lake)\n* Xiang River (Yueyang, Hunan)\n* Han River (Wuhan, Hubei)\n* Gan River (near Jiujiang, Jiangxi)\n* Shuiyang River (Dangtu, Anhui)\n* Qingyi River (Wuhu, Anhui)\n* Chao Lake water system (Chaohu, Anhui)\n* Lake Tai water system (Shanghai)\n\n\nThe Huai River flowed into the Yellow Sea until the 20th century, but now primarily discharges into the Yangtze.\n\n\n\n* ![Gan River in Jiangxi](image)\n\nGan River in Jiangxi\n* ![Han River in Hubei](image)\n\nHan River in Hubei\n* ![Lake Dongting and the Yuan, Zi, Li, and Xiang Rivers in Hunan](image)\n\nLake Dongting and the Yuan, Zi, Li, and Xiang Rivers in Hunan\n* ![Wu River in Guizhou](image)\n\nWu River in Guizhou\n* ![Jialing River in eastern Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality](image)\n\nJialing River in eastern Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality\n* ![Min River in central Sichuan](image)\n\nMin River in central Sichuan\n* ![Yalong River in western Sichuan](image)\n\nYalong River in western Sichuan\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\n* Sanjiangyuan (\"Three Rivers' Sources\") National Nature Reserve in Qinghai\n* Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan\n\n\n## Wildlife[edit]\n\n\nThe Yangtze River has a high species richness, including many endemics. A high percentage of these are seriously threatened by human activities.[93]\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The two sturgeon species in the Yangtze (here Chinese sturgeon) are both seriously threatened.\nAs of 2011[update], 416 fish species are known from the Yangtze basin, including 362 that strictly are freshwater species. The remaining are also known from salt or brackish waters, such as the river's estuary or the East China Sea. This makes it one of the most species-rich rivers in Asia and by far the most species-rich in China (in comparison, the Pearl River has almost 300 fish species and the Yellow River 160).[93] 178 fish species are endemic to the Yangtze River Basin.[93] Many are only found in some section of the river basin and especially the upper reach (above Yichang, but below the headwaters in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) is rich with 279 species, including 147 Yangtze endemics and 97 strict endemics (found only in this part of the basin). In contrast, the headwaters, where the average altitude is above 4,500 m (14,800 ft), are only home to 14 highly specialized species, but 8 of these are endemic to the river.[93] The largest orders in the Yangtze are Cypriniformes (280 species, including 150 endemics), Siluriformes (40 species, including 20 endemics), Perciformes (50 species, including 4 endemics), Tetraodontiformes (12 species, including 1 endemic) and Osmeriformes (8 species, including 1 endemic). No other order has more than four species in the river and one endemic.[93]\n\n\nMany Yangtze fish species have declined drastically and 65 were recognized as threatened in the 2009 Chinese red list.[94] Among these are three that are considered entirely extinct (Chinese paddlefish, *Anabarilius liui liui* and *Atrilinea macrolepis*), two that are extinct in the wild (*Anabarilius polylepis*, *Schizothorax parvus*), four that are critically endangered *Euchiloglanis kishinouyei*, *Megalobrama elongata*, *Schizothorax longibarbus* and *Leiocassis longibarbus*).[94][95] Additionally, both the Yangtze sturgeon and Chinese sturgeon are considered critically endangered by the IUCN. The survival of these two sturgeon may rely on the continued release of captive bred specimens.[96][97] Although still listed as critically endangered rather than extinct by both the Chinese red list and IUCN, recent reviews have found that the Chinese paddlefish is extinct.[98][99] Surveys conducted between 2006 and 2008 by ichthyologists failed to catch any, but two probable specimens were recorded with hydroacoustic signals.[100] The last definite record was an individual that was accidentally captured near Yibin in 2003 and released after having been radio tagged.[95] The Chinese sturgeon is the largest fish in the river and among the largest freshwater fish in the world, reaching a length of 5 m (16 ft); the extinct Chinese paddlefish reputedly reached as much as 7 m (23 ft), but its maximum size is labeled with considerable uncertainty.[101][102][103]\n\n\n\n![](image)The silver carp is native to the river, but has (like other Asian carp) been spread through large parts of the world with aquaculture.\nThe largest threats to the Yangtze native fish are overfishing and habitat loss (such as building of dams and land reclamation), but pollution, destructive fishing practices (such as fishing with dynamite or poison) and introduced species also cause problems.[93] About 2⁄3 of the total freshwater fisheries in China are in the Yangtze Basin,[104] but a drastic decline in size of several important species has been recorded, as highlighted by data from lakes in the river basin.[93] In 2015, some experts recommend a 10-year fishing moratorium to allow the remaining populations to recover,[105] and in January 2020 China imposed a 10-year fishing moratorium on 332 sites along the Yangtze.[106] Dams present another serious problem, as several species in the river perform breeding migrations and most of these are non-jumpers, meaning that normal fish ladders designed for salmon are ineffective.[93] For example, the Gezhouba Dam blocked the migration of the paddlerfish and two sturgeon,[96][97][102] while also effectively splitting the Chinese high fin banded shark population into two[107] and causing the extirpation of the Yangtze population of the Japanese eel.[108] In an attempt of minimizing the effect of the dams, the Three Gorges Dam has released water to mimic the (pre-dam) natural flooding and trigger the breeding of carp species downstream.[109] In addition to dams already built in the Yangtze basin, several large dams are planned and these may present further problems for the native fauna.[109]\n\n\nWhile many fish species native to the Yangtze are seriously threatened, others have become important in fish farming and introduced widely outside their native range. A total of 26 native fish species of the Yangtze basin are farmed.[105] Among the most important are four Asian carp: grass carp, black carp, silver carp and bighead carp. Other species that support important fisheries include northern snakehead, Chinese perch, *Takifugu* pufferfish (mainly in the lowermost sections) and predatory carp.[93]\n\n\n\n### Other animals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The critically endangered Chinese alligator is one of the smallest crocodilians, reaching a maximum length of about 2 m (7 ft).[110]\nDue to commercial use of the river, tourism, and pollution, the Yangtze is home to several seriously threatened species of large animals (in addition to fish): the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, baiji (Yangtze river dolphin), Chinese alligator, Yangtze giant softshell turtle and Chinese giant salamander. This is the only other place besides the United States that is native to an alligator and paddlefish species. In 2010, the Yangtze population of finless porpoise was 1000 individuals. In December 2006, the Yangtze river dolphin was declared functionally extinct after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin's inhabitance.[111] In 2007, a large, white animal was sighted and photographed in the lower Yangtze and was tentatively presumed to be a *baiji*.[112] However, as there have been no confirmed sightings since 2004, the *baiji* is presumed to be functionally extinct at this time.[113] \"Baijis were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins.\" It has been argued that the extinction of the Yangtze river dolphin was a result of the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, a project that has affected many species of animals and plant life found only in the gorges area.[114]\n\n\nNumerous species of land mammals are found in the Yangtze valley, but most of these are not directly associated with the river. Three exceptions are the semi-aquatic Eurasian otter, water deer and Père David's deer.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)The entirely aquatic Chinese giant salamander is the world's largest amphibian, reaching up to 1.8 m (5.9 ft) in length.[116]\nIn addition to the very large and exceptionally rare Yangtze giant softshell turtle, several smaller turtle species are found in the Yangtze basin, its delta and valleys. These include the Chinese box turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Pan's box turtle, Yunnan box turtle, yellow pond turtle, Chinese pond turtle, Chinese stripe-necked turtle and Chinese softshell turtle, which all are considered threatened.[117]\n\n\nMore than 160 amphibian species are known from the Yangtze basin, including the world's largest, the critically endangered Chinese giant salamander.[118] It has declined drastically due to hunting (it is considered a delicacy), habitat loss and pollution.[116] The polluted Dian Lake, which is part of the upper Yangtze watershed (via Pudu River), is home to several highly threatened fish, but was also home to the Yunnan lake newt. This newt has not been seen since 1979 and is considered extinct.[119][120] In contrast, the Chinese fire belly newt from the lower Yangtze basin is one of the few Chinese salamander species to remain common and it is considered least concern by the IUCN.[120][121][122]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Chinese mitten crab is a commercially important species in the Yangtze,[123] but invasive in other parts of the world.[124]\nThe Yangtze basin contains a large number of freshwater crab species, including several endemics.[125] A particularly rich genus in the river basin is the potamid *Sinopotamon*.[126] The Chinese mitten crab is catadromous (migrates between fresh and saltwater) and it has been recorded up to 1,400 km (870 mi) up the Yangtze, which is the largest river in its native range.[124] It is a commercially important species in its native range where it is farmed,[123] but the Chinese mitten crab has also been spread to Europe and North America where considered invasive.[124]\n\n\nThe freshwater jellyfish *Craspedacusta sowerbii*, now an invasive species in large parts of the world, originates from the Yangtze.[127]\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\nThe Yangtze River cruise, also called the \"Three Gorges cruise\", is a popular tourist attraction.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Category: Tributaries of the Yangtze River\n* List of rivers in China\n* Northern and Southern China, traditionally divided by the Huai River but sometimes considered to separate at the Yangtze\n* *Rediscovering the Yangtze River*\n* Ship lifts in China\n* South-North Water Transfer Project\n* Steamboats on the Yangtze River\n* Yangtze River Crossing\n* Yangtze Service Medal\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Encyclopædia Britannica: Yangtze River http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110538/Yangtze-River Archived August 21, 2008, at the Wayback Machine\n2. **^** Zhang Zengxin; Tao Hui; Zhang Qiang; Zhang Jinchi; Forher, Nicola; Hörmann, Georg (2009). \"Moisture budget variations in the Yangtze River Basin, China, and possible associations with large-scale circulation\". *Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment*. **24** (5): 579–589. doi:10.1007/s00477-009-0338-7.

Although the Dangqu (or Dam Chu) is the geographic source of the Yangtze River, the Ulan Moron has been traditionally regarded as the main river. With its location in Inner Asia, it therefore belongs to the East China Sea watershed basin.\n\n\nIt begins as melt-off from the Geladandong glaciers and runs to a confluence with the Dangqu, where they form the Tongtian River.\n\n\nIn Chinese, the character 河 originally described the Yellow River and 江 the Yangtze. In modern practice, a *jiang* is usually a longer river, while *he* varies from shorter rivers (as the Tuotuo) to creeks (such as Suzhou Creek in Shanghai).\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Yangtze River\n* List of rivers in China\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Powers, John & al. *Historical Dictionary of Tibet*, p. 155.

It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa and has historically been considered the longest river in the world,[3][4] though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.[5][6] Of the world's major rivers, the Nile is one of the smallest, as measured by annual flow in cubic metres of water.[7] About 6,650 km (4,130 mi)[a] long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt.[9] In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.[10] Additionally, the Nile is an important economic river, supporting agriculture and fishing.\n\n\nThe Nile has two major tributaries – the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream. However, the Blue Nile is the source of most of the water of the Nile downstream, containing 80% of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia[11] and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.[12]\n\n\nThe northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Nubian Desert to Cairo and its large delta, and the river flows into the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may require copy editing for grammar, style, cohesion, tone, or spelling**.

This is how the Nile river looked to Arabs when they first discovered it looking at the river from distance as an indigo snake in the yellow background of desert.[15][16]\n\n\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called *Ḥꜥpy* (Hapy) or *Jtrw* (Iteru), meaning \"river\". In Coptic, the word ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ, pronounced *piaro* (Sahidic) or *phiaro* (Bohairic), means \"the river\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \"the.canal-great\"), and comes from the same ancient name.[17] In Nobiin the river is called *Áman Dawū*, meaning \"the great water\".[2] In Luganda the river is called *Kiira* or *Kiyira*. In Runyoro it is called *Kihiira*. In Egyptian Arabic, the Nile is called *en-Nīl*, while in Standard Arabic it is called *an-Nīl*. In Biblical Hebrew, it is הַיְאוֹר‎, *Ha-Ye'or* or הַשִׁיחוֹר‎, *Ha-Shiḥor*.\n\n\nThe English name *Nile* and the Arabic names *en-Nîl* and *an-Nîl* both derive from the Latin **Nilus** and the Ancient Greek Νεῖλος.[18][19] Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed.[19][20] Homer called the river Αἴγυπτος, *Aiguptos*, but in subsequent periods, Greek authors referred to its lower course as *Neilos*; this term became generalised for the entire river system.[21] Thus, the name may derive from Ancient Egyptian expression *n*ꜣ *r*ꜣ*w-ḥ*ꜣ*w(t)* (lit. 'the mouths of the front parts'), which referred specifically to the branches of the Nile transversing the Delta, and would have been pronounced *ni-lo-he* in the area around Memphis in the 8th century BCE.[21] Hesiod at his *Theogony* refers to Nilus (Νεῖλος) as one of the Potamoi (river gods), son of Oceanus and Tethys.[22]\n\n\nAnother derivation of *Nile* might be related to the term *Nil* (Sanskrit: नील, romanized: *nila*; Egyptian Arabic: نيلة),[17] which refers to *Indigofera tinctoria*, one of the original sources of indigo dye.[23] Another may be *Nymphaea caerulea*, known as \"The Sacred Blue Lily of the Nile\", which was found scattered over Tutankhamun's corpse when it was excavated in 1922.[24][*citation needed*] Another possible etymology derives from the Semitic term *Nahal*, meaning \"river\".[25] Old Libyan has the term *lilu*, meaning water (in modern Berber *ilel* ⵉⵍⴻⵍ means *sea*).[26]\n\n\n\n## Courses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Nile's drainage basin[27]\nWith a total length of about 6,650 km (4,130 mi)[a] between the region of Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile is among the longest rivers on Earth. The drainage basin of the Nile covers 3,254,555 square kilometers (1,256,591 sq mi), about 10% of the area of Africa.[28] Compared to other major rivers, though, the Nile carries little water (5% of that of the Congo River, for example).[29] The Nile basin is complex, and because of this, the discharge at any given point along the main stem depends on many factors including weather, diversions, evaporation and evapotranspiration, and groundwater flow.\n\n\nUpstream from Khartoum (to the south), the river is known as the White Nile, a term also used in a limited sense to describe the section between Lake No and Khartoum. At Khartoum, the river is joined by the Blue Nile. The White Nile starts in equatorial East Africa, and the Blue Nile begins in Ethiopia. Both branches are on the western flanks of the East African Rift.\n\n\n\n### Sources[edit]\n\n\n\"Source of the Nile\" redirects here. For other uses, see Source of the Nile (board game) and Source of the Nile Bridge.\n\n![](image)Spring at Lake Victoria\nThe source of the Blue Nile is Lake Tana[30] in the Gish Abay region[31] in the Ethiopian Highlands.[32][33]\n\n\nThe source of the White Nile, even after centuries of exploration, remains in dispute. The most remote source that is indisputably a source for the White Nile is the Kagera River; however, the Kagera has tributaries that are in contention for the farthest source of the White Nile. Two start in Burundi: the Ruvyironza River (also known as the Luvironza) and the Rurubu River.[34][33] In addition, in 2010, an exploration party in Rwanda[35] went to a place described as the source of the Rukarara tributary,[36] and by hacking a path up steep jungle-choked mountain slopes in the Nyungwe Forest found (in the dry season) an appreciable incoming surface flow for many kilometres upstream, and found a new source, giving the Nile a length of 6,758 km (4,199 mi).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### In Uganda[edit]\n\n\n![](image)White Nile in Uganda\nThe White Nile leaves Lake Victoria at Ripon Falls near Jinja, Uganda, as the \"Victoria Nile.\" It flows north for some 130 kilometers (81 mi) to Lake Kyoga. The last part of the approximately 200 kilometers (120 mi) river section starts from the western shores of the lake and flows at first to the west until just south of Masindi Port, where the river turns north, then makes a great half circle to the east and north to Karuma Falls. For the remaining part, it flows westerly through the Murchison Falls until it reaches the northern shores of Lake Albert where it forms a significant river delta. Lake Albert is on the border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but the Nile is not a border river at this point. After leaving Lake Albert, the river continues north through Uganda and is known as the Albert Nile.\n\n\n\n### In South Sudan[edit]\n\n\nThe White Nile flows into South Sudan just south of Nimule, where it is known as the *Bahr al Jabal* (\"Mountain River\"[37]). Just south of the town is the confluence with the Achwa River. The Bahr al Ghazal, 716 kilometers (445 mi) long, joins the Bahr al Jabal at a small lagoon called Lake No, after which the Nile becomes known as the *Bahr al Abyad*, or the White Nile, from the whitish clay suspended in its waters. When the Nile floods it leaves a rich silty deposit which fertilizes the soil. The Nile no longer floods in Egypt since the completion of the Aswan Dam in 1970. An anabranch river, the Bahr el Zeraf, flows out of the Nile's Bahr al Jabal section and rejoins the White Nile.\n\n\nThe flow rate of the Bahr al Jabal at Mongalla is almost constant throughout the year and averages 1,048 m3/s (37,000 cu ft/s). After Mongalla, the Bahr Al Jabal enters the enormous swamps of the Sudd region. More than half of the Nile's water is lost in this swamp to evaporation and transpiration. The average flow rate of the White Nile at the tails of the swamps is about 510 m3/s (18,000 cu ft/s). From here it meets with the Sobat River at Malakal. On an annual basis, the White Nile upstream of Malakal contributes about 15% of the total outflow of the Nile.[38]\n\n\nThe average flow of the White Nile at Lake Kawaki Malakal, just below the Sobat River, is 924 m3/s (32,600 cu ft/s); the peak flow is approximately 1,218 m3/s (43,000 cu ft/s) in October and minimum flow is about 609 m3/s (21,500 cu ft/s) in April. This fluctuation is caused by the substantial variation in the flow of the Sobat, which has a minimum flow of about 99 m3/s (3,500 cu ft/s) in March and a peak flow of over 680 m3/s (24,000 cu ft/s) in October.[39] During the dry season (January to June) the White Nile contributes between 70% and 90% of the total discharge from the Nile.\n\n\n\n### In Sudan[edit]\n\n\nBelow Renk, the White Nile enters Sudan, it flows north to Khartoum and meets the Blue Nile.\n\n\nThe course of the Nile in Sudan is distinctive. It flows over six groups of cataracts, from the sixth at Sabaloka just north of Khartoum northward to Abu Hamad. The tectonic uplift of the Nubian Swell diverts the river south-west for over 300 km, following the structure of the Central African Shear Zone embracing the Bayuda Desert. At Al Dabbah it resumes its northward course towards the first cataract at Aswan forming the 'S'-shaped Great Bend of the Nile[40] mentioned by Eratosthenes.[41]\n\n\nIn the north of Sudan, the river enters Lake Nasser (known in Sudan as Lake Nubia), the larger part of which is in Egypt.\n\n\n\n### In Egypt[edit]\n\n\nBelow the Aswan Dam, at the northern limit of Lake Nasser, the Nile resumes its historic course. North of Cairo, the Nile splits into two branches (or distributaries) that feed the Mediterranean: the Rosetta Branch to the west and the Damietta to the east, forming the Nile Delta.\n\n\n\n### Sediment transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nile Delta from space\nThe annual sediment transport by the Nile in Egypt has been quantified.[42]\n\n\n\n* At Aswan: 0.14 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 28% of bedload\n* At Beni Sweif: 0.5 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 20% of bedload\n* At Qena: 0.27 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 27% of bedload\n* At Sohag: 1.5 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 13% of bedload\n\n\n## Tributaries[edit]\n\n\n### Red Nile[edit]\n\n\nBelow the confluence with the Blue Nile the only major tributary is the Atbarah River, also known as the Red Nile. Roughly halfway to the sea, it originates in Ethiopia north of Lake Tana, and is around 800 kilometers (500 mi) long. The Atbarah flows only while there is rain in Ethiopia and dries very rapidly. During the dry period of January to June, it typically dries up north of Khartoum.\n\n\n\n### Blue Nile[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Blue Nile\n\n![](image)The Blue Nile Falls fed by Lake Tana near the city of Bahir Dar, Ethiopia\n![](image)Annotated view of the Nile and Red Sea, with a dust storm[43]\nThe Blue Nile (Amharic: ዓባይ, *ʿĀbay*[44][45]) springs from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian Highlands. The Blue Nile flows about 1,400 kilometres to Khartoum, where the Blue Nile and White Nile join to form the Nile.[46] Ninety percent of the water and ninety-six percent of the transported sediment carried by the Nile[47] originates in Ethiopia, with fifty-nine percent of the water from the Blue Nile (the rest being from the Tekezé, Atbarah, Sobat, and small tributaries). The erosion and transportation of silt only occurs during the Ethiopian rainy season when rainfall is especially high in the Ethiopian Highlands; the rest of the year, the great rivers draining Ethiopia into the Nile have a weaker flow. In harsh and arid seasons and droughts, the Blue Nile dries out completely.[48]\n\n\nThe flow of the Blue Nile varies considerably over its yearly cycle and is the main contribution to the large natural variation of the Nile flow. During the dry season the natural discharge of the Blue Nile can be as low as 113 m3/s (4,000 cu ft/s), although upstream dams regulate the flow of the river. During the wet season, the peak flow of the Blue Nile often exceeds 5,663 m3/s (200,000 cu ft/s) in late August (a difference of a factor of 50).\n\n\nBefore the placement of dams on the river the yearly discharge varied by a factor of 15 at Aswan. Peak flows of over 8,212 m3/s (290,000 cu ft/s) occurred during late August and early September, and minimum flows of about 552 m3/s (19,500 cu ft/s) occurred during late April and early May.\n\n\n\n### Bahr el Ghazal and Sobat River[edit]\n\n\nThe Bahr al Ghazal and the Sobat River are the two most important tributaries of the White Nile in terms of discharge.\n\n\nThe Bahr al Ghazal's drainage basin is the largest of any of the Nile's sub-basins, measuring 520,000 square kilometers (200,000 sq mi) in size, but it contributes a relatively small amount of water, about 2 m3/s (71 cu ft/s) annually, because tremendous volumes of water are lost in the Sudd wetlands.\n\n\nThe Sobat River, which joins the Nile a short distance below Lake No, drains about half as much land, 225,000 km2 (86,900 sq mi), but contributes 412 cubic meters per second (14,500 cu ft/s) annually to the Nile.[49] When in flood the Sobat carries a large amount of sediment, adding greatly to the White Nile's color.[50]\n\n\n\n### Yellow Nile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Nile tributaries in modern Sudan, showing the Yellow Nile\n![](image)The Nile represented in an ancient Roman mosaic found from the ruins of Pompeii.\n  \n\nThe Yellow Nile is a former tributary that connected the Ouaddaï highlands of eastern Chad to the Nile River Valley c. 8000 to c. 1000 BCE.[51] Its remains are known as the Wadi Howar. The wadi passes through Gharb Darfur near the northern border with Chad and meets up with the Nile near the southern point of the Great Bend.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Sahara § Climate history\n\n![](image)Reconstruction of the Oikoumene (inhabited world), an ancient map based on Herodotus' description of the world, circa 450 BC\nThe Nile has been the lifeline of civilization in Egypt since the Stone Age, with most of the population and all of the cities of Egypt developing along those parts of the Nile valley lying north of Aswan. However, the Nile used to run much more westerly through what is now Wadi Hamim and Wadi al Maqar in Libya and flow into the Gulf of Sidra.[52] As the sea level rose at the end of the most recent ice age, the stream which is now the northern Nile captured the ancestral Nile near Asyut.[53] This change in climate also led to the current extents of the Sahara desert, around 3400 BCE.[54]\n\n\n\n### Khufu branch[edit]\n\n\nThe Giza pyramid complex originally overlooked a branch of the Nile that no longer exists. This branch was highest during the African Humid Period.[55][56]\n\n\n\n### Ancient Niles[edit]\n\n\nThe existing Nile has five earlier phases;\n\n\n\n* i) the Upper Miocenian Eonile, of about 6 million years BP,[57][7]\n* ii) the Upper Pliocenian Paleonile, commencing about 3.32 million years BP, and during the Pleistocene, the Nile phases\n* iii) Proto-Nile, commencing about 600,000 years BP,\n* iv) Pre-Nile,[58] transitioning at about 400,000 years BP to the[57]\n* v) Neo-Nile.[58]\n\n\nFlowing north from the Ethiopian Highlands, satellite imagery was used to identify dry watercourses in the desert to the west of the Nile. A canyon, now filled by surface drift, represents the **Eonile** that flowed during 23–5.3 million years before present. The Eonile transported clastic sediments to the Mediterranean; several natural gas fields have been discovered within these sediments.\n\n\nDuring the late-Miocene Messinian salinity crisis, when the Mediterranean Sea was a closed basin and evaporated to the point of being empty or nearly so, the Nile cut its course down to the new base level until it was several hundred metres below world ocean level at Aswan and 2,400 m (7,900 ft) below Cairo.[59][60] This created a very long and deep canyon which was filled with sediment after the Mediterranean was recreated.[61] At some point the sediments raised the riverbed sufficiently for the river to overflow westward into a depression to create Lake Moeris.\n\n\nLake Tanganyika drained northwards into the Nile until the Virunga Volcanoes blocked its course in Rwanda. The Nile was much longer at that time, with its furthest headwaters in northern Zambia. The currently existing Nile first flowed during the former parts of the Würm glaciation period.[7]\n\n\nAffad 23 is an archaeological site located in alluvial deposits formed by an ancient channel of the Nile in the Affad region of southern Dongola Reach, Sudan.[62]\n\n\n\n### Integrated Nile[edit]\n\n\nThere are two theories about the age of the integrated Nile. One is that the integrated drainage of the Nile is of young age and that the Nile basin was formerly broken into series of separate basins, only the most northerly of which fed a river following the present course of the Nile in Egypt and Sudan. Rushdi Said postulates that Egypt supplied most of the waters of the Nile during the early part of its history.[63]\n\n\nThe other theory is that the drainage from Ethiopia via rivers equivalent to the Blue Nile, the Atbara and the Takazze flowed to the Mediterranean via the Egyptian Nile since well back into Tertiary times.[64]\n\n\nSalama suggests that during the Paleogene and Neogene Periods (66 million to 2.588 million years ago) a series of separate closed continental basins each occupied one of the major parts of the Sudanese Rift System: Mellut rift, White Nile rift, Blue Nile rift, Atbara rift and Sag El Naam rift.[65]\nThe Mellut Basin is nearly 12 kilometers (7.5 mi) deep at its central part. This rift is possibly still active, with reported tectonic activity in its northern and southern boundaries. The Sudd swamp which forms the central part of the basin may still be subsiding. The White Nile Rift system, although shallower than the Bahr el Arab rift, is about 9 kilometers (5.6 mi) deep. Geophysical exploration of the Blue Nile Rift System estimated the depth of the sediments to be 5–9 kilometers (3.1–5.6 mi). These basins were not interconnected until their subsidence ceased, and the rate of sediment deposition was enough to fill and connect them.\n\n\nThe Egyptian Nile connected to the Sudanese Nile, which captures the Ethiopian and Equatorial headwaters during the current stages of tectonic activity in the Eastern, Central and Sudanese Rift systems.[66] The connection of the different Niles occurred during cyclic wet periods. The Atbarah overflowed its closed basin during the wet periods that occurred about 100,000 to 120,000 years ago. The Blue Nile connected to the main Nile during the 70,000–80,000 years B.P. wet period. The White Nile system in Bahr El Arab and White Nile Rifts remained a closed lake until the connection of the Victoria Nile to the main system some 12,500 years ago during the African humid period.\n\n\n\n### Role in the founding of Egyptian civilization[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Ancient Egyptian agriculture\n\n![](image)An aerial view of irrigation from the Nile River supporting agriculture in Luxor, Egypt\n![](image)A felucca traversing the Nile near Aswan\nThe Greek historian Herodotus wrote that \"Egypt was the gift of the Nile\". An unending source of sustenance, it played a crucial role in the development of Egyptian civilization. Because the river overflowed its banks annually and deposited new layers of silt, the surrounding land was very fertile. The Ancient Egyptians cultivated and traded wheat, flax, papyrus and other crops around the Nile. Wheat was a crucial crop in the famine-plagued Middle East. This trading system secured Egypt's diplomatic relationships with other countries and contributed to economic stability. Far-reaching trade has been carried on along the Nile since ancient times.[*citation needed*] A tune, Hymn to the Nile, was created and sung by the ancient Egyptian peoples about the flooding of the Nile River and all of the miracles it brought to Ancient Egyptian civilization.[67]\n\n\nWater buffalo were introduced from Asia, and the Assyrians introduced camels in the 7th century BCE. These animals were raised for meat and were domesticated and used for ploughing—or in the camels' case, carriage. Water was vital to both people and livestock. The Nile was also a convenient and efficient means of transportation for people and goods.\n\n\nThe Nile was also an important part of ancient Egyptian spiritual life. Hapi was the god of the annual floods, and both he and the pharaoh were thought to control the flooding. The Nile was considered to be a causeway from life to death and the afterlife. The east was thought of as a place of birth and growth, and the west was considered the place of death, as the god Ra, the Sun, underwent birth, death, and resurrection each day as he crossed the sky. Thus, all tombs were west of the Nile, because the Egyptians believed that in order to enter the afterlife, they had to be buried on the side that symbolized death.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAs the Nile was such an important factor in Egyptian life, the ancient calendar was even based on the three cycles of the Nile. These seasons, each consisting of four months of thirty days each, were called Akhet, Peret, and Shemu. Akhet, which means inundation, was the time of the year when the Nile flooded, leaving several layers of fertile soil behind, aiding in agricultural growth.[68] Peret was the growing season, and Shemu, the last season, was the harvest season when there were no rains.[68]\n\n\n\n### European search for the source[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Hanning Speke c. 1863. Speke was the Victorian explorer who first reached Lake Victoria in 1858, returning to establish it as the source of the Nile by 1862.[69]\nOwing to their failure to penetrate the Sudd wetlands of South Sudan, the upper reaches of the White Nile remained largely unknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans. Vitruvius thought that source of the Nile is in Mauritania, on the \"other\" (south) side of the Atlas Mountains.[70] Various expeditions failed to determine the river's source. Agatharchides records that in the time of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, a military expedition had penetrated far enough along the course of the Blue Nile to determine that the summer floods were caused by heavy seasonal rainstorms in the Ethiopian Highlands, but no European of antiquity is known to have reached Lake Tana. The *Tabula Rogeriana* depicted the source as three lakes in 1154.\n\n\nEuropeans began to learn about the origins of the Nile in the 14th century when the Pope sent monks as emissaries to Mongolia who passed India, the Middle East and Africa, and described being told of the source of the Nile in Abyssinia (Ethiopia)[71] Later in the 15th and 16th centuries, travelers to Ethiopia visited Lake Tana and the source of the Blue Nile in the mountains south of the lake. Putatively, Paolo Trevisani (circa 1452-1483), a Venetian traveller in Ethiopia, wrote a journal of his travels to the *origin of the Nile* that has since been lost.[72][73] Although James Bruce claimed to be the first European to have visited the headwaters,[74] modern writers give the credit to the Jesuit Pedro Páez. Páez's account of the source of the Nile[75] is a long and vivid account of Ethiopia. It was published in full only in the early 20th century, although it was featured in works of Páez's contemporaries, including Baltazar Téllez,[76] Athanasius Kircher[77] and by Johann Michael Vansleb.[78]\n\n\nEuropeans had been resident in Ethiopia since the late 15th century, and one of them may have visited the headwaters even earlier without leaving a written trace. The Portuguese João Bermudes published the first description of the Tis Issat Falls in his 1565 memoirs, compared them to the Nile Falls alluded to in Cicero's *De Republica*.[79] Jerónimo Lobo describes the source of the Blue Nile, visiting shortly after Pedro Páez. Telles also uses his account.\n\n\nThe White Nile was even less understood. The ancients mistakenly believed that the Niger River represented the upper reaches of the White Nile. For example, Pliny the Elder writes that the Nile had its origins \"in a mountain of lower Mauretania\", flowed above ground for \"many days\" distance, then went underground, reappeared as a large lake in the territories of the Masaesyli, then sank again below the desert to flow underground \"for a distance of 20 days' journey till it reaches the nearest Ethiopians.\"[80]\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of the Nile c. 1911, a time when its entire primary course ran through British occupations, condominiums, colonies, and protectorates[19]\nModern exploration of the Nile basin began with the conquest of the northern and central Sudan by the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, and his sons from 1821 onward. As a result of this, the Blue Nile was known as far as its exit from the Ethiopian foothills and the White Nile as far as the mouth of the Sobat River. Three expeditions under a Turkish officer, Selim Bimbashi, were made between 1839 and 1842, and two got to the point about 30 kilometres (20 miles) beyond the present port of Juba, where the country rises and rapids make navigation very difficult.\n\n\nLake Victoria was first sighted by Europeans in 1858 when British explorer John Hanning Speke reached its southern shore while traveling with Richard Francis Burton to explore central Africa and locate the great lakes. Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this \"vast expanse of open water\" for the first time, Speke named the lake after Queen Victoria. Burton, recovering from illness and resting further south on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, was outraged that Speke claimed to have proven his discovery to be the true source of the Nile when Burton regarded this as still unsettled. A quarrel ensued which sparked intense debate within the scientific community and interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke's discovery. British explorer and missionary David Livingstone pushed too far west and entered the Congo River system instead. It was ultimately Welsh-American explorer Henry Morton Stanley who confirmed Speke's discovery, circumnavigating Lake Victoria and reporting the great outflow at Ripon Falls on the lake's northern shore.\n\n\n\n### Since 1950[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The confluence of the Kagera and Ruvubu rivers near Rusumo Falls, part of the Nile's upper reaches\n![](image)Dhows on the Nile ![](image)The Nile passes through Cairo, Egypt's capital city.\nThe Nile has long been used to transport goods along its length. Winter winds blow south, up river, so ships could sail up river using sails and down river using the flow of the river. While most Egyptians still live in the Nile valley, the 1970 completion of the Aswan Dam ended the summer floods and their renewal of the fertile soil, fundamentally changing farming practices. The Nile supports much of the population living along its banks, enabling Egyptians to live in otherwise inhospitable regions of the Sahara. The river's flow is disturbed at several points by the Cataracts of the Nile which form an obstacle to navigation by boats. The Sudd also forms a formidable navigation obstacle and impedes water flow, to the extent that Sudan had once attempted to build the Jonglei Canal to bypass the swamp.[81][82]\n\n\nNile cities include Khartoum, Aswan, Luxor (Thebes), and the Giza – Cairo conurbation. The first cataract, the closest to the mouth of the river, is at Aswan, north of the Aswan Dam. This part of the river is a regular tourist route, with cruise ships and traditional wooden sailing boats known as feluccas. Many cruise ships ply the route between Luxor and Aswan, stopping at Edfu and Kom Ombo along the way. Security concerns have limited cruising on the northernmost portion for many years.\n\n\nA computer simulation study to plan the economic development of the Nile was directed by H.A.W. Morrice and W.N. Allan, for the Ministry of Hydro-power of Sudan, during 1955–57[83][84][85] Morrice was their hydrological adviser, and Allan his predecessor. The calculations were enabled by accurate monthly inflow data collected for 50 years. The underlying principle was the use of over-year storage, to conserve water from rainy years for use in dry years. Irrigation, navigation and other needs were considered. Each computer run postulated a set of reservoirs and operating equations for the release of water as a function of the month and the levels upstream. The behavior that would have resulted given the inflow data was modeled. Over 600 models were run. Recommendations were made to the Sudanese authorities. The calculations were run on an IBM 650 computer. Simulation studies to design water resources are discussed further in the article on hydrology transport models, which have been used since the 1980s to analyze water quality.\n\n\nDespite the development of many reservoirs, drought during the 1980s led to widespread starvation in Ethiopia and Sudan, but Egypt was nourished by water impounded in Lake Nasser. Drought has proven to be a major cause of fatality in the Nile river basin. According to a report by the Strategic Foresight Group around 170 million people have been affected by droughts in the last century with half a million lives lost.[86] From the 70 incidents of drought which took place between 1900 and 2012, 55 incidents took place in Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya and Tanzania.[86]\n\n\n\n## Water sharing dispute[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hydropower dams in the Nile (plus huge dam under construction in Ethiopia)\nThe Nile's water has affected the politics of East Africa and the Horn of Africa for many decades. The dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the $4.5 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam has become a national preoccupation in both countries, stoking patriotism, deep-seated fears and even murmurs of war.[87] Countries including Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya have complained about Egyptian domination of its water resources. The Nile Basin Initiative promotes a peaceful cooperation among those states.[88][89]\n\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to establish agreements between the countries sharing the Nile waters. On 14 May 2010 at Entebbe, Uganda, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Tanzania signed a new agreement on sharing the Nile water even though this agreement raised strong opposition from Egypt and Sudan. Ideally, such international agreements should promote equitable and efficient usage of the Nile basin's water resources. Without a better understanding about the availability of the future water resources of the Nile, it is possible that conflicts could arise between these countries relying on the Nile for their water supply, economic and social developments.[10]\n\n\n\n## Modern achievements and exploration[edit]\n\n\n### White Nile[edit]\n\n\nIn 1951, American John Goddard together with two French explorers became the first to successfully navigate the entire Nile from its source in Burundi at the potential headsprings of the Kagera River in Burundi to its mouth on the Mediterranean Sea, a journey of approximately 6,800 km (4,200 mi). Their 9-month journey is described in the book *Kayaks down the Nile*.[90]\n\n\nThe White Nile Expedition, led by South African national Hendrik Coetzee, navigated the White Nile's entire length of approximately 3,700 kilometres (2,300 mi). The expedition began at the White Nile's beginning at Lake Victoria in Uganda, on 17 January 2004 and arrived at the Mediterranean in Rosetta, four and a half months later.[91]\n\n\n\n### Blue Nile[edit]\n\n\nThe Blue Nile Expedition, led by geologist Pasquale Scaturro and his partner, kayaker and documentary filmmaker Gordon Brown became the first known people to descend the entire Blue Nile, from Lake Tana in Ethiopia to the beaches of Alexandria on the Mediterranean. Their approximately 5,230-kilometre (3,250 mi) journey took 114 days, from 25 December 2003 to 28 April 2004. Though their expedition included others, Brown and Scaturro were the only ones to complete the entire journey.[92] Although they descended whitewater manually, the team used outboard motors for much of their journey.\n\n\nOn 29 January 2005, Canadian Les Jickling and New Zealander Mark Tanner completed the first human-powered transit of Ethiopia's Blue Nile. Their journey of over 5,000 kilometres (3,100 mi) took five months. They recount that they paddled through two war zones, regions notorious for bandits, and were arrested at gunpoint.[93]\n\n\n\n## Crossings[edit]\n\n\n### Crossings from Khartoum to the Mediterranean Sea[edit]\n\n[*clarification needed*]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qasr El Nil Bridge in Cairo, with Gezira Island in the background\n![](image)El Mek Nimr Bridge in Khartoum\nThe following bridges cross the Blue Nile and connect Khartoum to Khartoum North:\n\n\n\n* Mac Nimir Bridge\n* Blue Nile Road & Railway Bridge\n* Burri Bridge\n* Elmansheya Bridge\n* Soba Bridge\n\n\nThe following bridges cross the White Nile and connect Khartoum to Omdurman:\n\n\n\n* White Nile Bridge\n* Fitayhab Bridge\n* Al Dabbaseen Bridge (under construction)[*when?*]\n* Omhuraz Bridge (proposed)[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe following bridges cross from Omdurman: to Khartoum North:\n\n\n\n* Shambat Bridge\n* Halfia Bridge\n\n\nThe following bridges cross to Tuti from Khartoum state's three cities\n\n\n\n* Khartoum-Tuti Bridge\n* Omdurman-Tuti Suspension Bridge (proposed)[*citation needed*]\n* Khartoum North-Tuti Bridge (proposed)[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOther bridges\n\n\n\n* Shandi Bridge, Shendi\n* Atbarah Bridge, Atbarah\n* Merowe Dam, Merowe\n* Merowe Bridge, Merowe\n* Aswan Bridge, Aswan\n* Luxor Bridge, Luxor\n* Suhag Bridge, Suhag\n* Assiut Bridge, Assiut\n* Al Minya Bridge, Minya\n* Al Marazeek Bridge, Helwan\n* First Ring Road Bridge (Moneeb Crossing), Cairo\n* Abbas Bridge, Cairo\n* University Bridge, Cairo\n* Qasr al-Nil Bridge, Cairo\n* 6th October Bridge, Cairo\n* Abu El Ela Bridge, Cairo (removed in 1998)\n* New Abu El Ela Bridge, Cairo\n* Imbaba Bridge, Cairo\n* Rod Elfarag Bridge, Cairo\n* Second Ring Road Bridge, Cairo\n* Banha Bridge, Banha\n* Samanoud Bridge, Samanoud\n* Mansoura 2 Bridges, Mansoura\n* Talkha Bridge, Talkha\n* Shirbine high Bridge\n* Shirbine Bridge\n* Kafr Sad – Farscor Bridge\n* International Coastal Road Bridge\n* Damietta high Bridge, Damietta\n* Damietta Bridge, Damietta\n* Kafr El Zayat Bridges, Kafr El Zayat\n* Zefta Bridge, Zefta\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(August 2008)*\n |\n\n\n### Crossings from Jinja, Uganda to Khartoum[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(April 2009)*\n |\n\n\n* Source of the Nile Bridge, Jinja, Uganda\n* River Nile Railway Bridge, Jinja, Uganda\n* Nalubaale Bridge, Jinja, Uganda (Formerly Owen Falls Bridge)\n* Karuma Bridge, Karuma, Uganda\n* Pakwach Bridge, Uganda\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Rivers portal\n* ![map](image)Africa portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* Bujagali Hydroelectric Power Station\n* Egyptian Public Works\n* Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station\n* Water politics in the Nile Basin\n* Merowe Dam\n* Nalubaale Hydroelectric Power Station\n* Orders of magnitude\n* Vid Flumina, a river of liquid methane and ethane on Saturn's moon Titan\n* *The River War* (1899), Winston Churchill's second book, an account of steaming up the Nile to the Battle of Omdurman, Sudan, in 1898\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\nNotes\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** The length of the Nile is usually said to be about 6,650 km (4,130 mi),[3] but reported values lie anywhere between 5,499 km (3,417 mi) and 7,088 km (4,404 mi).[4] The measurements of many rivers' lengths are only approximations and may differ from each other because there are many factors that determine the calculated length of a river, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the technique used to measure length (see also List of rivers by length).[4][8]\n2. **^** Arabic: النيل, romanized: *an-Nīl*, Arabic pronunciation: [an'niːl], Bohairic Coptic: ⲫⲓⲁⲣⲟ Coptic pronunciation: [pʰjaˈro],[1] Luganda: *Kiira* Luganda pronunciation: [ki:ra], Nobiin: Áman Dawū[2]\n\nReferences\n1. **^** \"ⲓⲁⲣⲟ - Wiktionary\". *en.wiktionary.org*.

The name comes from the clay sediment carried in the water that changes the water to a pale color.[4]\n\n\nIn the strict meaning, \"White Nile\" refers to the river formed at Lake No, at the confluence of the Bahr al Jabal and Bahr el Ghazal Rivers. In the wider sense, \"White Nile\" refers to all the stretches of river draining from Lake Victoria through to the merger with the Blue Nile: the \"Victoria Nile\" from Lake Victoria via Lake Kyoga to Lake Albert, then the \"Albert Nile\" to the South Sudan border, and then the \"Mountain Nile\" or \"Bahr-al-Jabal\" down to Lake No.[5] \"White Nile\" may sometimes include the headwaters of Lake Victoria, the most remote of which being 3,700 km (2,300 mi) from the Blue Nile.[3]\n\n\nThe 19th-century search by Europeans for the source of the Nile was mainly focused on the White Nile, which disappeared into the depths of what was then known as \"Darkest Africa\".\n\n\n\n![](image)A map showing the White Nile and the Blue Nile in East Africa.\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n### Headwaters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rusumo Falls\nThe Kagera River, which flows into Lake Victoria near the Tanzanian town of Bukoba, is the longest feeder river for Lake Victoria, although sources do not agree on which is the longest tributary of the Kagera, and hence the most distant source of the Nile.[6] The source of the Nile can be considered to be either the Ruvyironza, which emerges in Bururi Province, Burundi[7] (near Bukirasaz), or the Nyabarongo, which flows from Nyungwe Forest in Rwanda.[8]\n\n\nThese two feeder rivers meet near Rusumo Falls on the border between Rwanda and Tanzania. These waterfalls are known for an event on 28–29 April 1994, when 250,000 Rwandans crossed the bridge at Rusumo Falls into Ngara, Tanzania, in 24 hours, in what the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees called \"the largest and fastest refugee exodus in modern times\". The Kagera forms part of the Rwanda–Tanzania and Tanzania–Uganda borders before flowing into Lake Victoria.\n\n\n\n### In Uganda[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rafters flipping in Bujagali Falls near the mouth of the Victoria Nile\nThe White Nile in Uganda goes under the name of \"Victoria Nile\" from Lake Victoria via Lake Kyoga to Lake Albert, and then as the \"Albert Nile\" from there to the border with South Sudan.\n\n\n\n#### Victoria Nile[edit]\n\n\nThe Victoria Nile starts at the outlet of Lake Victoria, at Jinja, Uganda, on the northern shore of the lake.[9] Downstream from the Nalubaale Power Station and the Kiira Power Station at the outlet of the lake, the river goes over Bujagali Falls (the location of the Bujagali Power Station) about 15 km (9.3 mi) downstream from Jinja. The river then flows northwest through Uganda to Lake Kyoga in the centre of the country, thence west to Lake Albert.\n\n\nAt Karuma Falls, the river flows under Karuma Bridge (2°14′45.40″N 32°15′9.05″E﻿ / ﻿2.2459444°N 32.2525139°E﻿ / 2.2459444; 32.2525139) at the southeastern corner of Murchison Falls National Park. During much of the insurgency of the Lord's Resistance Army, Karuma Bridge, built in 1963 to help the cotton industry, was the key stop on the way to Gulu, where vehicles gathered in convoys before being provided with a military escort for the final run north. In 2009, the government of Uganda announced plans to construct a 750-megawatt hydropower project several kilometres north of the bridge, which was scheduled for completion in 2016.[10] The World Bank had approved funding a smaller 200-megawatt power plant, but Uganda opted for a larger project, which the Ugandans will fund internally if necessary.[11]\n\n\nJust before entering Lake Albert, the river is compressed into a passage just seven meters wide at Murchison Falls, marking its entry into the western branch of the East African Rift. The river then flows into Lake Albert opposite the Blue Mountains in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\n\nThe stretch of river from Lake Kyoga to Lake Albert is sometimes called the \"Kyoga Nile\".[12]\n\n\n\n#### Albert Nile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bridge on Albert Nile\nThe river draining from Lake Albert to the north is called the \"Albert Nile\". It separates the West Nile sub-region of Uganda from the rest of the country. A bridge passes over the Albert Nile near its inlet in Nebbi District, but no other bridge over this section has been built. A ferry connects the roads between Adjumani and Moyo, and navigation of the river is otherwise done by small boat or canoe.\n\n\n\n### In South Sudan and Sudan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Confluence of Blue and White Nile near Khartoum\nFrom the point at which the river enters South Sudan from Uganda, the river goes under the name of \"Mountain Nile\". From Lake No in South Sudan the river becomes the \"White Nile\" in its strictest sense, and so continues northwards into Sudan where it ends at its confluence with the Blue Nile.\n\n\n\n#### Mountain Nile [edit]\n\n\nFrom Nimule in South Sudan, close to the border with Uganda, the river becomes known as the \"Mountain Nile\" or \"Baḥr al-Jabal\" (also \"Baḥr el-Jebel\", بحر الجبل), literally Mountain River\" or \"River of the Mountain\".[13][14] The Southern Sudanese state of Central Equatoria through which the river flows was known as *Bahr al-Jabal* until 2006.[15]\n\n\nThe southern stretch of the river encounters several rapids before reaching the Sudan plain and the vast swamp of the Sudd. It makes its way to Lake No, where it merges with the Bahr el Ghazal and there forms the White Nile.[16][17] An anabranch river called Bahr el Zeraf flows out of the Bahr al-Jabal at and flows through the Sudd, to eventually join the White Nile. The Mountain Nile cascades through narrow gorges and over a series of rapids that includes the Fula (Fola) Rapids.[17][18]\n\n\n\n![](image)The White and Blue Niles merge at Khartoum, the capital of Sudan.\n#### White Nile proper[edit]\n\n\nTo some people, the White Nile starts at the confluence of the Mountain Nile with the Bahr el Ghazal at Lake No.[16]\n\n\nThe 120 kilometers of White Nile that flow east from Lake No to the mouth of the Sobat are very gently sloping and hold many swamps and lagoons.[19] When in flood, the Sobat River tributary carries a large amount of sediment, adding greatly to the White Nile's pale color.[20] From South Sudan's second city Malakal, the river runs slowly but swamp-free into Sudan and north to Khartoum. Downstream from Malakal lies Kodok, the site of the 1898 Fashoda Incident that marked an end to the Scramble for Africa.\n\n\nIn Sudan the river lends its name to the Sudanese state of White Nile, before merging with the larger Blue Nile at Khartoum and forming the River Nile.\n\n\n\n## Inland waterways[edit]\n\n\nThe White Nile is a navigable waterway from the Lake Albert to Khartoum through Jebel Aulia Dam, only between Juba and Uganda requires the river upgrade or channel to make it navigable.\n\n\nDuring part of the year the rivers are navigable up to Gambela, Ethiopia, and Wau, South Sudan.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of rivers of Sudan\n* List of rivers of South Sudan\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Nile Africa | Africa Nile | Nile Valley | Mystery Nile | Nile White | Egypt Nile | Ancient Capital Nile\". 10 January 2007.

It travels for approximately 1,450 km (900 mi) through Ethiopia and Sudan. Along with the White Nile, it is one of the two major tributaries of the Nile and supplies about 85.6% of the water to the Nile during the rainy season.\n\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\nThe distance of the river from its source to its confluence has been variously reported as being between 1,460 kilometres (910 mi) and 1,600 kilometres (990 mi).[*citation needed*] This uncertainty might result from the fact that the river flows through a series of virtually impenetrable gorges cut in the Ethiopian Highlands to a depth of some 1,500 metres (4,900 ft).[*citation needed*] According to materials published by the Central Statistical Agency, the Blue Nile has a total length of 1,450 kilometres (900 mi), of which 800 kilometres (500 mi) are inside Ethiopia.[1]\n\n\n\n### In Ethiopia[edit]\n\n\nThe Blue Nile originates at Lake Tana in Ethiopia (where it is called the Abay River). The river flows generally south before entering a canyon about 400 km (250 mi) long, about 30 km (19 mi) from Lake Tana, which is a tremendous obstacle for travel and communication between north and south Ethiopia. The canyon was first referred to as the \"Grand Canyon\" in 1968 by a British team that accomplished the first descent of the river from Lake Tana to the end of the canyon; subsequent river rafting parties called it the \"Grand Canyon of the Nile\".[2] The Blue Nile Falls (Amharic: Tis Abay, literally \"great smoke\"), one of Ethiopia's biggest tourist attractions, is located at the start of the canyon.\n\n\nThe river loops across northwest Ethiopia before being fed by numerous tributaries between Lake Tana and the Ethiopia–Sudan border. Those on its left bank, in downstream order, include the Wanqa River, the Bashilo River, the Walaqa River, the Wanchet River, the Jamma River, the Muger River, the Guder River, the Agwel River, the Nedi River, the Didessa River and the Dabus River. Those on the right side, also in downstream order, include the Handassa, Tul, Abaya, Sade, Tammi, Cha, Shita, Suha, Muga, Gulla, Temcha, Bachat, Katlan, Jiba, Chamoga, Weter and the Beles.[3]\n\n\n\n### In Sudan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of where White and Blue Niles merge\nThe Blue Nile then heads northwest into Sudan. It travels for approximately 650 km (400 mi), flowing past Er Roseires and receiving the Dinder River on its right bank at Dinder. At Khartoum, the Blue Nile joins the White Nile and, as the Nile, flows through Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. \n\n\n\n## Water flow[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers near Khartoum, the capital of Sudan\nThe flow of the Blue Nile reaches maximum volume in the rainy season from June to September, when it supplies 80–86% of the water of the Nile proper. The river was a major source of the flooding of the Nile in Egypt that contributed to the fertility of the Nile Valley and the consequent rise of Ancient Egypt and Egyptian mythology. With the completion of the Aswan Dam in 1970, these floods stopped occurring in lower Egypt. During the summer monsoon season, the Blue Nile floods erode a vast amount of fertile soil from the Ethiopian Highlands and carry it downstream as silt, turning the water dark brown or almost black.[4]\n\n\nThe Blue Nile is vital to the livelihood of Egypt: as the most significant tributary of the Nile, it contributes over 85% of the Nile's streamflow.[5] Though shorter than the White Nile, 59% of the water that reaches Egypt originates from the Ethiopian highlands via the Blue Nile.[*citation needed*] The river is also an important resource for Sudan, where the Roseires Dam and Sennar Dam contribute to the 80% of the country's electricity generation from hydropower. These dams also help irrigate the Gezira Scheme, which is most famous for its high-quality cotton, as well as wheat and animal feed crop production in the area.\n\n\nIn November 2012, Ethiopia began construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, a 6000-megawatt hydroelectric dam on the river. The dam is expected to be a boost for the Ethiopian economy. Sudan and Egypt, however, voiced their concerns over a potential reduction in water available.[6] Electricity generation began in February 2022.[7]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Men pull each other across the Blue Nile by rope prior to the building of a new bridge\n![](image)Suspension bridge over the Blue Nile River. It is the only pedestrian cable bridge over the Blue Nile in Ethiopia.\n![](image)Blue Nile Gorge in Ethiopia.\n### Early European exploration[edit]\n\n\nThe first European known to have seen the Blue Nile in Ethiopia and the river's source was Pedro Páez, a Spanish Jesuit who reached the river's source on 21 April 1618.[8] However, the Portuguese João Bermudes, the self-described \"Patriarch of Ethiopia,\" provided the first description of the Tis Abay River Falls in his memoirs published in 1565, and any number of Europeans who lived in Ethiopia in the late 15th century such as Pêro da Covilhã could have seen the river long before Páez, but not reached its source. The source of the Nile proper was also reached in 1629 by the Portuguese Jesuit missionary Jerónimo Lobo and in 1770 by the Scottish explorer James Bruce.\n\n\nAlthough European explorers contemplated tracing the course of the Nile from the Blue Nile's confluence with the White Nile to Lake Tana, the Blue Nile Canyon has discouraged all attempts since Frédéric Cailliaud's attempt in 1821. The first serious attempt by a non-local to explore this reach of the river was undertaken by the American W.W. Macmillan in 1902, assisted by the Norwegian explorer B.H. Jenssen; Jenssen proceeded upriver from Khartoum while Macmillan sailed downstream from Lake Tana. However, Jenssen's boats were blocked by the rapids at Famaka short of the Sudan-Ethiopia border, and Macmillan's boats were wrecked shortly after they had been launched. Macmillan encouraged Jenssen to try to sail upstream from Khartoum again in 1905, but he was forced to stop 500 km (300 mi) short of Lake Tana.[9] Robert Cheesman, who records his surprise on arriving in Ethiopia at finding that the upper waters of \"one of the most famous of the rivers of the world, and one whose name was well known to the ancients\" was in his lifetime \"marked on the map by dotted lines\", managed to map the upper course of the Blue Nile between 1925 and 1933. He did this not by following the river along its banks and through its impassable canyon but by following it from the highlands above, travelling some 8,000 km (5,000 mi) by mule in the adjacent country.[10]\n\n\n\n### Present day[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, several kayakers paddled parts of the canyon. In 1968, at the request of Haile Selassie, a team of 60 British and Ethiopian servicemen and scientists made the first full descent of the river from Lake Tana to a point near the Sudanese border led by explorer John Blashford-Snell.[11] The team used specially-built Avon Inflatables and modified Royal Engineers assault boats to navigate the formidable rapids. Subsequent rafting expeditions in the 1970s and 1980s generally only covered parts of the river canyon.\n\n\nIn 1999, writer Virginia Morell[12] and photographer Nevada Wier made the journey by raft from Lake Tana to Sudan, publishing a documentary about their journey afterwards.[13] In 2000, American and National Geographic reader, Kenneth Frantz, saw a photo taken by Nevada Wier for *National Geographic* which would lead him to found the charity Bridges to Prosperity. This photo showed a bridge broken during World War II, with 10 men on either side of the broken span pulling each other across the dangerous gap by rope. This historic bridge was built by Emperor Fasilides in approximately 1660 with Roman bridge technology brought to Ethiopia by Portuguese soldiers during the battle with the Muslim invaders in 1507.[14] In both 2001 and 2009, Bridges to Prosperity volunteers travelled from the United States to repair the broken bridge across the Blue Nile and later built a new suspension bridge not susceptible to flood.[15]\n\n\nOn 28 April 2004, geologist Pasquale Scaturro and his partner, kayaker and documentary filmmaker Gordon Brown, became the first known people to navigate the Blue Nile in its entirety. Though their expedition included several others, Brown and Scaturro were the only ones to remain on the expedition for the entire journey. They chronicled their adventure with an IMAX camera and two handheld video cameras, sharing their story in the film *Mystery of the Nile* and in a book of the same title.[16]\n\n\nOn 29 January 2005, Canadian Les Jickling and his teammate New Zealander Mark Tanner completed the first fully human-powered transit of the entire Blue Nile and the Nile in the Sudan and Egypt. Their journey of over 5,000 km (3,100 mi) took five months and traveled through Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt. They recount that they paddled through civil war conflict zones, regions known for bandits, and encountered multiple hazards and rapids.[17]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of rivers of Ethiopia\n* List of rivers of Sudan\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Climate, 2008 National Statistics (Abstract)\" Archived 13 November 2010 at the Wayback Machine, Table A.1.
