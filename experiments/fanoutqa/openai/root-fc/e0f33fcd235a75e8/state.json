Curry and Thompson are generally considered among the greatest backcourts of all time.[11][12] The Warriors have the third most NBA championships and have the third most Finals appearances; only the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics have more. Wilt Chamberlain and Stephen Curry have been named the NBA's MVPs while playing for the Warriors, for a total of three MVP awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Golden State Warriors\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe team struggled in the 1980s, then became playoff regulars at the turn of the decade with stars Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin, nicknamed \"Run TMC\". Led by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, the team returned to championship glory in 2015, with defensive swingman Andre Iguodala being named Finals MVP. In 2016, the Warriors set the record for best regular season record at 73-9 before losing the Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers (against whom they played a record four straight finals) and becoming the first team to lose a series after leading 3\u20131 in the Finals. After signing former MVP Kevin Durant, the team won back-to-back championships in 2017 and 2018 (Durant winning both Finals MVPs). They lost the 2019 Finals to the Toronto Raptors, a series which saw Durant and Thompson suffer serious Achilles and ACL injuries, respectively; Durant left that off-season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Golden State Warriors |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) *2023\u201324 Golden State Warriors season* |\n| ![Golden State Warriors logo](image) |\n| Conference | Western |\n| Division | Pacific |\n| Founded | 1946 |\n| History | **Philadelphia Warriors**1946\u20131962**San Francisco Warriors**1962\u20131971**Golden State Warriors**1971\u2013present[1][2] |\n| Arena | Chase Center |\n| Location | San Francisco, California |\n| Team colors | Royal blue, yellow[3][4]\u00a0 \u00a0 |\n| Main sponsor | Rakuten[5] |\n| President | Brandon Schneider[6] |\n| General manager | Mike Dunleavy Jr.[7] |\n| Head coach | Steve Kerr |\n| Ownership | Joe Lacob (majority)Peter Guber |\n| Affiliation(s) | Santa Cruz Warriors |\n| Championships | **7** (1947, 1956, 1975, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2022) |\n| Conference titles | **7** (1975, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022) |\n| Division titles | **12** (1948, 1951, 1956, 1964, 1967, 1975, 1976, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) |\n| Retired numbers | **6** (13, 14, 16, 17, 24, 42) |\n| Website | www.nba.com/warriors |\n|  |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Association jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Association**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Icon jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Icon**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Statement jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Statement**\n |\n| ![](image)\n\n![City jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**City**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Classic jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Classic**\n |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\nThe **Golden State Warriors** are an American professional basketball team based in San Francisco. The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. Founded in 1946 in Philadelphia, the Warriors moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962 and took the city's name, before changing its geographic moniker to Golden State in 1971.[a][b] The club plays its home games at the Chase Center.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter missing the playoffs the following two seasons, the Warriors returned to the playoffs with a healthy Thompson and a new supporting cast that included All-Star Andrew Wiggins and key scorer Jordan Poole; they defeated the Boston Celtics in the 2022 Finals, where Curry won his first Finals MVP. The Warriors' dynasty has seen the team win four titles in eight seasons, as well as reach five consecutive Finals from 2015 to 2019 (six Finals in eight years); Curry, Green, Thompson, and Iguodala were on all four 21st century championship teams, Shaun Livingston and Kevon Looney were on three each.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Warriors swept the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs, defeated Memphis Grizzlies in six games in the second round, and dispatched Houston Rockets in five games in the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975. The team's opponent was the Cleveland Cavaliers, who would later go on to face the Warriors in each of the next three consecutive NBA Finals. After Golden State fell behind 2\u20131 in the series, Kerr gave swingman Andre Iguodala his first start of the season, replacing center Andrew Bogut in Game 4. The Warriors' small lineup (which came to be known as the Death Lineup) helped turn the series around.[71] The Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in six games, and Iguodala was named Finals MVP.[72] Kerr became the first rookie coach to win a title since Pat Riley in 1981\u201382.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 10, 2022, the Warriors clinched the third seed in the Western conference, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since the 2018\u201319 season. In the first round, they advanced past the Denver Nuggets, and triumphed over the Memphis Grizzlies in the conference semi-finals. On May 26, 2022, the Warriors advanced to their seventh NBA Finals after defeating the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals, 4\u20131. On June 16, 2022, the team won their seventh NBA title, beating the Boston Celtics 4\u20132. Curry, Thompson, Green, and Iguodala all won their fourth championship as members of the Warriors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGolden State Warriors\n |\n| --- |\n| * Founded in **1946**\n* Played in **Philadelphia** (1946\u20131962) and **Oakland** (1971\u20132019)\n* Based in **San Francisco, California**\n |\n| Franchise | * History\n* All-time roster\n* Draft history\n* Head coaches\n* Seasons\n* **Current season**\n |\n| Arenas | * Philadelphia Arena\n* Philadelphia Convention Hall\n* Cow Palace\n* San Francisco Civic Auditorium\n* USF War Memorial Gymnasium\n* San Diego Sports Arena\n* San Jose Arena\n* Oracle Arena\n* **Chase Center**\n |\n| Personnel | Owner(s)\nJoe Lacob (majority)\nPeter Guber\nPresident\nBrandon Schneider\nGeneral manager\nMike Dunleavy Jr.\nHead coach\nSteve Kerr\n |\n| G League affiliate | * Santa Cruz Warriors\n |\n| Retired numbers | * 13\n* 14\n* 16\n* 17\n* 24\n* 42\n |\n| NBA championships | * 1947\n* 1956\n* 1975\n* 2015\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2022\n |\n| Rivalries | * Cleveland Cavaliers\n* Los Angeles Lakers\n* Sacramento Kings\n |\n| Culture and lore | * 73\u20139\n* Dance Cam Mom\n* Death Lineup\n* \"Good Feeling\"\n* *Hangin' with Mr. Cooper*\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors swept the Cavaliers to win their second straight NBA championship; previously, there had not been an NBA Finals sweep since 2007.[112] On August 30, 2018, David West announced his retirement from the NBA after 15 seasons.[113][114] Following the 2018 NBA Finals, writers for *Sports Illustrated*,[115] *USA Today*,[91] *The Wall Street Journal*,[116] and the *New York Daily News*[117] described the Warriors as a dynasty.

On February 27, 2016, Curry also tied the NBA record of twelve three-pointers made in a single game, jointly holding it with Donyell Marshall and Kobe Bryant.[88]\n\n\nThe Warriors reached the NBA Finals for the second consecutive year, facing a rematch against the Cleveland Cavaliers.[89] The Warriors won three of the first four games of the 2016 NBA Finals, but the Cavaliers made a comeback to tie the series at three wins apiece.[90] Draymond Green was suspended for Game Five of the series, and Curry was ejected from Game Six.[91] In Game Seven, the Warriors lost the series on their home court, earning the distinction of becoming the first team to lose the NBA Finals after having led three games to one.[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors went into the 2018 playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference after earning a 2017\u201318 regular season record of 58\u201324.

The team finished the season with a record of 73\u20139.[86] On May 10, 2016, Stephen Curry was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second straight season. Curry is the 11th player to win back-to-back MVP honors and became the first player in NBA history to win the MVP award by unanimous vote, winning all 131 first-place votes.[87] Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2016 All-Star Game. Green broke the Golden State franchise record of nine triple-doubles in a season. Curry broke numerous three-point records during the season, including his own NBA record for made three-pointers in a season of 286; he finished the season with 402 three-pointers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors ended the season with a record of 51\u201331. The team won more than 50 games for only the fourth time in franchise history, finished 20 games over .500 for the first time in 22 years, and tied the 1991\u201392 squad for the franchise's all-time mark of 24 wins on the road. Even without Bogut, the Warriors battled the third-seed Los Angeles Clippers to a seventh and deciding game in the first round of the playoffs before their 2013\u201314 season came to an end. It was a season of many thrilling moments; the Warriors played in 17 regular-season games decided by two points or less, six games decided by winning shots in the final three seconds, and seven comeback wins in which the Warriors had been behind by 15 points or more.[62] Curry also made his first appearance in the All-Star Game in 2014. Curry and Klay Thompson continued to set league records in three-point shooting. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCurry, who finished the season with 261 threes, set an individual record for most three-pointers in a span of two seasons with 533, surpassing the previous mark of 478 set by former Seattle SuperSonics legend Ray Allen in 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306. Together, Thompson and Curry combined for 484 threes on the year, besting by one the NBA record they had set the year before.\n\n\n\n#### 2014\u20132019: The Dynasty[edit]\n\n\nJackson was fired as coach on May 6, 2014,[63] despite a unanimous declaration of support from his players[64] and a three-year 121\u2013109 (.526) record that marked a major turnaround and placed him fourth on the franchise's all-time wins list, trailing Alvin Attles (557), Don Nelson (422) and Eddie Gottlieb (263).[65] Over the 17 years before Jackson took the helm in 2011, the franchise had averaged 30.2 wins per season and made the playoffs only once.[66] Jackson became just the third Warriors head coach to notch at least 50 wins in a season, joining Nelson and Attles, who both hit the mark twice.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors posted many notable achievements during the 2016\u201317 regular season. On November 7, 2016, Stephen Curry set the NBA record for most 3-pointers in a game with 13, in a 116\u2013106 win over the Pelicans.[104] On December 5, 2016, Klay Thompson scored 60 points in 29 minutes, in a 142\u2013106 victory over the Pacers. In doing so, Thompson became the first player in NBA history to score 60 or more points in fewer than 30 minutes of playing time.[105] Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, making the Warriors only the eighth team in NBA history to have four All-Stars.[106] On February 10, 2017, Draymond Green recorded a triple-double with 12 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals, becoming the first player in NBA history to post a triple-double with fewer than 10 points.[107] On March 2, 2017, the Warriors' streak for most games without back-to-back losses ended at 146 with a 94\u201387 loss to the Chicago Bulls. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cavaliers\u2013Warriors rivalry\n\nWhile the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the NBA in 1970, the two teams' rivalry began to develop in the 2014\u201315 season when they met in the first of four consecutive NBA Finals. Previously, no pair of teams had faced each other in more than two consecutive Finals. The Warriors have won three of the four NBA Finals in which they faced the Cavaliers, losing in 2016, and winning in 2015, 2017, and 2018.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lakers\u2013Warriors rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Warriors completed the 2014\u20132015 regular season with a league-best record of 67\u201315, setting a Warriors record for wins.[70] The team finished with a home record of 39\u20132, second-best in NBA history. The team ranked first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving-led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. On May 4, Stephen Curry was named the 2014\u201315 NBA Most Valuable Player, the first Warrior since Wilt Chamberlain in 1960.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors earned home-court advantage throughout the 2017 playoffs, thanks to a 2016\u201317 regular-season record of 67\u201315. They were the first team in NBA playoff history to start the playoffs 12\u20130, defeating the Trail Blazers, the Jazz, and the Spurs in consecutive series. The 2017 Finals once again pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers, becoming the first time in NBA history that two teams met in the Finals for three consecutive years. The Warriors won the championship after going 4\u20131 in the Finals, and their 16\u20131 playoff record garnered the best winning percentage (.941) in NBA playoffs history.[109] After the Warriors announced that they were uncertain if they would make the customary visit to the White House by playoff champions, President Donald Trump rescinded his invitation.[110] The team still planned to travel to Washington, D.C. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n112. **^** Smith, Sekou (June 9, 2018). \"A Golden Era: Warriors clean up Cavaliers with a sweep, capture third NBA title in four years\". *NBA*.

Oakland Arena became the team's exclusive home court in 1971.\n\n\nThe Warriors made the playoffs from 1971 to 1977 except in 1974, and won their first NBA championship on the West Coast in 1974\u201375. In what many consider the biggest upset in NBA history, Golden State not only defeated the heavily favored Washington Bullets but humiliated them in a four-game sweep. That team was coached by former Warrior Al Attles, and led on the court by Rick Barry and Jamaal Wilkes. Barry was named Finals MVP.[17]\n\n\nAt 59\u201323, the Warriors had the league's best record during the 1975\u201376 season. They were upset, however, by the 42\u201340 Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\n\n\n### 1978\u20131985: Competitive struggles[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nGolden State Warriors seasons\n |\n| --- |\n| * Franchise\n* History\n* Seasons\n |\n| 1940s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **1946\u201347** | 1947\u201348 | 1948\u201349 |\n |\n| 1950s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1949\u201350 | 1950\u201351 | 1951\u201352 | 1952\u201353 | 1953\u201354 | 1954\u201355 | **1955\u201356** | 1956\u201357 | 1957\u201358 | 1958\u201359 |\n |\n| 1960s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1959\u201360 | 1960\u201361 | 1961\u201362 | 1962\u201363 | 1963\u201364 | 1964\u201365 | 1965\u201366 | 1966\u201367 | 1967\u201368 | 1968\u201369 |\n |\n| 1970s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1969\u201370 | 1970\u201371 | 1971\u201372 | 1972\u201373 | 1973\u201374 | **1974\u201375** | 1975\u201376 | 1976\u201377 | 1977\u201378 | 1978\u201379 |\n |\n| 1980s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Golden State Warriors Hall of Famers\n |\n| --- |\n| Players\n |\n| No. | Name | Position | Tenure | Inducted | No. | Name | Position | Tenure | Inducted\n |\n| **17** | Andy Phillip | G/F | 1950\u20131953 | 1961 | **15** | Tom Gola | F/G | 1955\u20131962 | 1976\n |\n| **10** | Joe Fulks | F | 1946\u20131954 | 1978 | **11** | Paul Arizin | F/G | 1950\u20131962 | 1978\n |\n| **13** | Wilt Chamberlain | C | 1959\u20131965 | 1978 | **32****47** | Jerry Lucas 2 | F/C | 1969\u20131971 | 1980\n |\n| **42** | Nate Thurmond | F/C | 1963\u20131974 | 1985 | **24** | Rick Barry | F | 1965\u201319671972\u20131978 | 1987\n |\n| **6** | Neil Johnston | C | 1951\u20131959 | 1990 | **00** | Robert Parish | C | 1976\u20131980 | 2003\n |\n| **17** | Chris Mullin 1 | G/F | 1985\u201319972000\u20132001 | 2011 | **41** | Jamaal Wilkes | F | 1974\u20131977 | 2012\n |\n| **50** | Ralph Sampson | C/F | 1987\u20131989 | 2012 | **30** | Bernard King | F | 1980\u20131982 | 2013\n |\n| **5****25** | Guy Rodgers | G | 1958\u20131966 | 2014 | **23** | Mitch Richmond | G | 1988\u20131991 | 2014\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArizin, Fulks, Gola, Johnston and Phillip played all or most of their tenure with the Warriors in Philadelphia.

They were owned by Peter A. Tyrrell, who also owned the Philadelphia Rockets of the American Hockey League.[13] Tyrrell hired Eddie Gottlieb, a longtime basketball promoter in the Philadelphia area, as coach and general manager.[14] The owners named the team after the Philadelphia Warriors, an old basketball team who played in the American Basketball League in 1925.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\npossibly returning to their former name of San Francisco Warriors,[127] it was ultimately decided that they would remain the Golden State Warriors upon their return to San Francisco.[128]\n\n\nAfter the Finals loss to Toronto, during which Durant tore his Achilles and Thompson tore his ACL, Durant chose to sign a four-year deal with the Brooklyn Nets. In order to not lose Durant for nothing, the Warriors sent Durant along with a protected first-round pick (2020) to the Nets in exchange for D'Angelo Russell in a two-way sign-and-trade. The sign-and-trade triggered a hard cap for the Warriors, who were forced to trade Iguodala's $17 million salary to the Memphis Grizzlies while also giving them a top-4 protected 2024 first-round pick as incentive.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther highlights of the 2014\u201315 season included Stephen Curry breaking his own record for three-pointers made in a single season with 286.

In the postseason, Curry shattered Reggie Miller's record of 58 made three-pointers in a single postseason with 98. On January 23, 2015, Klay Thompson broke an NBA record for points in a quarter with 37 in the third. Curry was also the leader in the voting polls for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, won the 2014\u201315 NBA Most Valuable Player award and the 2015 ESPYs Best Male Athlete award.\n\n\n\n![](image)Draymond Green was an All-NBA Second Team member in 2015\u201316.\nOn July 27, 2015, David Lee\u2014who had lost his starting power forward job to Draymond Green during the season[74][75]\u2014was traded to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb;[76] Golden State was seeking to offload his salary given his limited role on the team.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** \"Warriors Sign Leandro Barbosa to Contract\". *National Basketball Association*.

They opened the season with six straight losses, but Ellis' rise, Davis' solid injury-free season (21.6 points, 8 assists, 4.6 rebounds per game),[25] and an overall improvement in team chemistry brought them back to playoff contention; but in the end the Warriors failed to make the playoffs despite a 48\u201334 record, which is the best record in NBA history for a non-playoff team since the NBA playoffs had expanded to eight teams per conference. The Western Conference was very strong that season; every playoff team won 50 games, leaving the Warriors two games out of the last playoff spot.

On April 11, in a 112\u201395 stomping of the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center, the Warriors clinched a playoff berth in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. However, just one day earlier in a loss against the Portland Trail Blazers, Andrew Bogut suffered a cracked rib kept him out of the postseason; the injury dealt a blow to the sixth-seed Warriors' playoff hopes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***Note:** GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Season | GP | W | L | W\u2013L% | Finish | Playoffs\n |\n| 2018\u201319 | 82 | 57 | 25 | .695 | 1st, Pacific | Lost in NBA Finals, 2\u20134 (Raptors)\n |\n| 2019\u201320 | 65 | 15 | 50 | .231 | 5th, Pacific | Did not qualify\n |\n| 2020\u201321 | 72 | 39 | 33 | .542 | 4th, Pacific | Did not qualify\n |\n| 2021\u201322 | 82 | 53 | 29 | .646 | 2nd, Pacific | NBA champions, 4\u20132 (Celtics)\n |\n| 2022\u201323 | 82 | 44 | 38 | .537 | 4th, Pacific | Lost in Conference Semifinals, 2\u20134 (Lakers)\n |\n\n\n## Home arenas[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEntering the 2006\u201307 season, the Warriors held the active record (12) for the most consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance (see Active NBA non-playoff appearance streaks). During the 2006 off-season, Golden State announced that it had bought out the remaining two years of coach Montgomery's contract and hired previous Golden State and former Dallas Mavericks coach Don Nelson to take over for him. During training camp, small forward Matt Barnes established himself in the rotation. On January 17, 2007, the Warriors traded the disappointing Murphy and Dunleavy with promising young power forward Ike Diogu and Keith McLeod to the Indiana Pacers for forward Al Harrington, forward/guard Stephen Jackson, guard \u0160ar\u016bnas Jasikevi\u010dius and forward Josh Powell.[22] This trade allowed the Warriors to \"run and gun\" their way to the playoffs with a more athletic and talented team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors were not one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble on June 4, which ended their 2019\u201320 season with a league-worst record of 15\u201350.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Annual events | Draft\neligibility\nSummer League\nChristmas\nMartin Luther King Jr. Day\nAll-Star weekend\ngame\nGlobal Games\nCup tournament\nPlay-in\nPlayoffs\nlist\nfinals\nchampions\n |\n| History | Predecessors\nBAA\nNBL\nABA\nmerger\nWalter A.

After the trade of star Wilt Chamberlain in January 1965, the team finished the 1964\u201365 season with the NBA's worst record (17\u201363). Their rebuilding period was brief due in large part to the Warriors' drafting of Rick Barry four months after the trade.

The loss dropped them to 26\u201335.\n\n\nMarch 4 marked the turning point for the Warriors. The Warriors closed out the regular season (42\u201340) at 16\u20135 in their last 21 games.[23] \"We believe\" became the Warriors' slogan for the last two months of the season and the playoffs.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSince the Sacramento Kings relocated there in 1985, they have shared a geographic rivalry with the Warriors, as both cities are 86 miles apart from one another. However, despite the Kings joining the BAA in 1948 (when they were then known as the Royals and based in Rochester, New York), due to both teams having long periods of failing to make the playoffs, the two teams would not face each other in the postseason until 2023, where they faced off in the first round. [164] In a bitterly fought series, including a rough play between Damontas Sabonis and Draymond Green in game 2 where Green stomped roughly on Sabonis's chest after he grabbed Green's leg (resulting in Green being suspended in game 3)[165] and several violent viral fan scuffles throughout the series (as opposing fans were widespread at both the Chase Center and Golden 1 Center due to the geographic proximity),[166] the Warriors would defeat the Kings in seven games to advance to the semifinals. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Warriors enjoyed a great start to the 2005\u201306 season, entering the new year with a plus .500 winning percentage for the first time since 1994, but managed to win only 13 more games through the end of March due to injuries. Davis often found himself at odds with new head coach Mike Montgomery (used to dealing with college players in his long tenure at Stanford) and failed to remain healthy, playing in just 54 games. On April 5, 2006, the Warriors were officially eliminated from playoff contention in a 114\u2013109 overtime loss to the Hornets, extending their playoff drought to 12 seasons.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Warriors have utilized several different logo and uniform designs throughout their history, with the most recent redesign occurring in 2010.[3] However, on June 12, 2019, the Warriors unveiled subtle adjustments to their primary logo, including a new custom font.[153] The club then unveiled six new uniform designs using the newly updated logo on September 17, 2019.[154]\n\n\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, the Warriors wore a \"City\" uniform that paid tribute to the \"We Believe\" era in Oakland, as well as their 47 seasons there in general. It features the same coloring scheme as well as the \"Oakland\" location identifier in the lettering of the previous logo.[155]\n\n\nFor the 2021\u201322 season, the Warriors wore a Warriors Origins jersey, which is a modernization of their 1961\u201362 road uniform. The 1961\u201362 season was their last season in Philadelphia, as well as the season in which Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in a single game. The jersey also commemorates the 75th anniversary of the franchise.[156]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Warriors had another injury-prone year in 2009\u201310[28] as they were consistently unable to field their ideal starting lineup. In November, a malcontented Stephen Jackson and seldom-used Acie Law were traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for Raja Bell (out for the season with an injury) and Vladimir Radmanovic. Four days later, they signed center Chris Hunter. Starting in January 2010, they issued multiple 10-day contracts, most notably to power forward Anthony Tolliver from the Idaho Stampede. Due to their multiple injuries, they were granted an exception allowing them to sign Reggie Williams from the Sioux Falls Skyforce to a 10-day contract on March 2. They eventually waived the injured Bell to sign Williams for the rest of the year and finished the season 26\u201356, failing to make the playoffs. Curry finished second in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting to the Sacramento Kings' Tyreke Evans and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 2020 NBA draft lottery, the Warriors landed the second overall pick in the draft, which they used to draft James Wiseman.[130] They also drafted Nico Mannion with the 48th overall pick. Just as the 2020\u201321 NBA season was about to begin, guard Klay Thompson was reported to miss the incoming season due to an Achilles tendon injury making the second season he missed in his career.[131] At the beginning of the season against the Nets, Curry dropped 20 points to a 99\u2013125 loss to the Nets.[132] They finished the regular season with a 39\u201333 record, qualifying for the new NBA play-in-tournament[133] against the seventh seeded Los Angeles Lakers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLed by early scoring sensation Joe Fulks, the team won the championship in the league's inaugural 1946\u201347 season by defeating the Chicago Stags, four games to one. The NBA, which was created by a 1949 merger, officially recognizes that as its own first championship.[c] Gottlieb bought the team in 1951.\n\n\nThe Warriors won its next championship in Philadelphia in the 1955\u201356 season, defeating the Fort Wayne Pistons four games to one. The Warrior stars of this era were future Hall of Famers Paul Arizin, Tom Gola and Neil Johnston.\n\n\n\n### 1959\u20131965: The Wilt Chamberlain era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDue of the loss of key players such as Barry, Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements, the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some players such as high-scoring forward Purvis Short (1978), former Purdue center Joe Barry Carroll (1980) and center Robert Parish (1976), who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become Kevin McHale for the pick used to draft Carroll. In 1983, the Warriors matched the New York Knicks' offer for free-agent Bernard King, but, unable to pay his high salary, quickly traded him to the Knicks for guard Micheal Ray Richardson, whom they soon shipped to New Jersey in exchange for former Georgetown Hoya point guard Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd, and journeyman forward Mickey Johnson. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors began the 2013\u201314 season showing flashes of brilliance and also plenty of lapses. In early December their record was 12\u20139, as compared to 17\u20134 the year before. One challenging factor was a tough starting schedule that saw them play 14 of their first 22 games on the road, including 10 games against teams holding playoff spots in the standings. A stream of injuries also held the team back, including injuries to Ezeli, Douglas, and O'Neal. Most prominently of all, Iguodala suffered a hamstring pull in late November that kept him out for over a month; during this period, the Warriors' performance suffered significantly on both the defensive and offensive ends of the court and the team posted a losing 5\u20137 record while revealing a lack of bench depth. With Iguodala back in the lineup, the Warriors went on a 10-game winning streak that included six consecutive wins on a single road trip, tying an NBA record. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors won 36 games and failed to make the playoffs in 2010\u201311. The team broke a franchise record with 21 made three-pointers in a win against the Orlando Magic. In February 2011, the Warriors traded Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric for Troy Murphy and a 2012 second-round pick that was used on Draymond Green. On February 27, Murphy and the Warriors reached a buyout agreement and he was waived.[33][34] In April 2011, Dorell Wright made a franchise record of 184 three-pointers in a season in a home win versus Los Angeles Lakers, surpassing Richardson's 183 in 2005\u201306. In a win against the Portland Trail Blazers, Wright then broke another NBA record, becoming the first player to have scored more points in his seventh season than in all his first six seasons combined. Wright ended the season with the most three-pointers made in the NBA that season with 194, as well as the most three-pointers attempted with 516; each mark set a new Warriors franchise record. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** \"B&H Basketball Player Ognjen Kuzmi\u0107 is the New Player of the Golden State Warriors\". *Sarajevo Times*.

On July 4, 2016, Kevin Durant announced he was leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder to sign a two-year contract with the Golden State Warriors.[93] On July 7, Durant signed his contract, which gave the Warriors a fourth All-NBA player on their team.[94] The Durant signing made the Warriors prohibitive favorites to win the 2017 NBA championship, according to oddsmakers.[95] On July 9, 2016, free-agent forward Harrison Barnes signed with the Dallas Mavericks.[96][97] Centers Festus Ezeli[98] and Marreese Speights[99] left the Warriors for other teams, as did guard Leandro Barbosa.[100] Center Andrew Bogut was traded, along with a future second-round pick, to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for a future conditional second-round pick.[101] Veteran power forward David West signed with the Warriors,[102] as did free-agent center Zaza Pachulia.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn July 15, 2010, owner Chris Cohan sold the Warriors to Peter Guber of Mandalay Entertainment and his partner Joe Lacob for a then-record $450\u00a0million.[30] On November 15, the Warriors announced the new 19-person ownership group composed of Joe Lacob, Peter Guber, Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9, Erika Glazer, Fred Harman, Bob Piccinini, Larry Bowman, Danny German, Marty Glick, Chad Hurley, Craig R. Johnson, Bruce Karsh, Jeffrey A. Miller, Paul Schaeffer, David Scially, Nick Swinmurn, Harry Tsao, John Walecka, Dennis Wong and Chamath Palihapitiya.[31]\n\n\nThe Warriors continued their 2010 off-season signing spree by adding Harvard guard Jeremy Lin to their roster with a one-year partially guaranteed contract containing a second-year team option; Lin became the first Taiwanese-American player in NBA history. Louis Amundson was then added for little under $5\u00a0million in mid-September. After coach Don Nelson resigned in September 2010, assistant coach Keith Smart was hired as the team's new head coach.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2021, the Golden State Warriors, among other high-profile athletes and celebrities, were a paid spokespersons for FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. In November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, wiping out billions of dollars in customer funds. The Warriors, alongside other spokespeople, are currently being sued for promoting unregistered securities through a class-action lawsuit.[148] In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.[149]\n\n\n\n#### 2022\u20132023: Uncertainty[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2022\u201323 season, the Warriors faced a challenging regular season due to numerous injuries. Key players like Iguodala, DiVincenzo, Thompson, Green, Kuminga, and Curry, who was also unable to participate in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, were impacted.[150][151][152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n123. **^** \"Board gives Warriors' arena initial green light\". *The San Francisco Chronicle*.\n124. **^** \"The Warriors gamble their soul as they swap Oakland for San Francisco\". *The Guardian*.\n125. **^** \"Warriors formally purchase Mission Bay site\".

Due to the 2011 NBA lockout, Jackson could not establish his system in training camp. Hindered by several injuries to key players, the team then entered into another chaotic rebuilding phase. Team leader Monta Ellis was traded in mid-March 2012, along with Kwame Brown and Ekpe Udoh, to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Andrew Bogut (out injured for the season) and former Warrior small forward Stephen Jackson, who without playing a game for the Warriors was quickly traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Richard Jefferson and a conditional first-round pick on March 15. These moves saw the rise of Stephen Curry and David Lee to team co-captains, and saw Thompson move into a starting role. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1962, Franklin Mieuli purchased the majority shares of the team and relocated the franchise to the San Francisco Bay Area, renaming them the San Francisco Warriors. The Warriors played most of their home games at the Cow Palace in Daly City (the facility lies just south of the San Francisco city limits) from 1962 to 1964 and the San Francisco Civic Auditorium from 1964 to 1966, though occasionally playing home games in nearby cities such as Oakland and San Jose. They also played frequently at The University of San Francisco gymnasium.\n\n\nPrior to the 1963\u201364 NBA season, the Warriors drafted big man Nate Thurmond to go along with Chamberlain. The Warriors won the Western Division crown that season, but lost the 1964 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics, four games to one. In the 1964\u201365 season, the Warriors traded Chamberlain to the Philadelphia 76ers for Connie Dierking, Lee Shaffer, Paul Neumann and $150,000 and won only 17 games.\n\n\n\n### 1965\u20131978: Thurmond and Barry[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n156. **^** \"Warriors Unveil 2021\u201322 Warriors Origins Jersey, Presented by Rakuten, Ahead of 75th Anniversary Season\". *Warriors.com*.

Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike. Unlike the Dodgers\u2013Giants rivalry of MLB, or the 49ers\u2013Rams rivalry of the NFL in which both teams express fierce animosity against one another.[157][158] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991. Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

In 2016, the Cavaliers won their first NBA Championship, marking Cleveland's first major sports title since 1964. The 2016 NBA Finals victory over the Golden State Warriors marked the first time in Finals history a team had come back to win the series after trailing, 3\u20131.

While the Heat had a 224\u201388 record during James' four-year tenure and won NBA titles in 2012 and 2013, the Cavaliers went 97\u2013215 and missed the playoffs each season.[57] The Cavaliers made several moves to build a championship-contending team around James, most notably acquiring power forward Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, which created what many fans and media referred to as a \"Big Three\" with James, Love and Irving.[58] The Lebron-led Cavaliers made four consecutive Finals appearances from 2015 to 2018 \u2013 all against the Golden State Warriors \u2013 winning in 2016.[38][59] The 2016 NBA Championship marked the Cavaliers' first title in franchise history, as they became the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 deficit to win the Finals.[59] It was also Cleveland's first championship in major professional sports since the 1964 Browns, signaling the end of the so-called Cleveland sports curse.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNational Basketball Association team in Cleveland, Ohio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Cleveland Cavaliers |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) *2023\u201324 Cleveland Cavaliers season* |\n| ![Cleveland Cavaliers logo](image) |\n| Conference | Eastern |\n| Division | Central |\n| Founded | 1970 |\n| History | **Cleveland Cavaliers**1970\u2013present[1][2] |\n| Arena | Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse |\n| Location | Cleveland, Ohio |\n| Team colors | Wine, gold, black[3][4][5]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n| Main sponsor | Cleveland-Cliffs[6] |\n| CEO | Nic Barlage[7] |\n| President | Koby Altman |\n| General manager | Mike Gansey |\n| Head coach | J.

The Cavaliers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team began play as an expansion team in 1970, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Buffalo Braves. Home games were first held at Cleveland Arena from 1970 to 1974, followed by the Richfield Coliseum from 1974 to 1994. Since 1994, the Cavs have played home games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in downtown Cleveland, which is shared with the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. Dan Gilbert has owned the team since March 2005.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Cavaliers began play in the 1970\u201371 season as an expansion team.[9] They set losing records in each of their first five seasons before winning their first division title in 1976.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16] The 1976 team was led by Austin Carr, Bobby \"Bingo\" Smith, Jim Chones, Dick Snyder, Nate Thurmond and head coach Bill Fitch.[17] It was remembered for the \"Miracle at Richfield\", in which the Cavaliers defeated the Washington Bullets, 4\u20133, in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.[18] They won Game 7, 87\u201385, on a shot by Snyder with four seconds to go.[18] The Cavaliers moved on to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time,[18] but were without Chones after he broke his toe before the series opener.[19] As a result, the Cavaliers went on to lose, 4\u20132, to the Boston Celtics.[20] They made playoff appearances in the following two seasons before a six-year playoff drought.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Cavaliers' roster went through many changes in the 2017\u201318 season, most notably the trade of Irving to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Isaiah Thomas and other assets.[61][62] Thomas was later traded to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a trade deadline overhaul that saw the Cavaliers add Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr. (son of Cavs legend Larry Nance) and others.[63] The following offseason, James declined his player option to rejoin the team, instead signing with the Lakers.[64] In the following two seasons, the team recorded only 19 wins and failed to make the playoffs.[38]\n\n\nIn the first three seasons since James left the second time, the Cavaliers won a total of 60 games, missed the playoffs each season and have had four different head coaches: Tyronn Lue, Larry Drew, John Beilein and current head coach J.B. Bickerstaff.[38][65][66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** \"1982-83 Cleveland Cavaliers Schedule and Results\". *Basketball-Reference.com*.

During the latter half of the 1980s and through much of the 1990s, the Cavs were a regular playoff contender \u2013 led by players such as Mark Price and Brad Daugherty \u2013 and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992. After the team's playoff appearance in the 1997\u201398 season, however, the Cavs had six consecutive losing seasons with no playoff action. Cleveland was awarded with the top overall pick in the 2003 draft, and they selected LeBron James. Behind James and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers again became a regular playoff contender by 2005. They made their first appearance in the NBA Finals in 2007 after winning the first Eastern Conference championship in franchise history. After failing to return to the NBA Finals in the ensuing three seasons, James joined the Miami Heat in 2010. As a result, the Cavaliers finished the 2010\u201311 season last in the conference, enduring a 26-game losing streak, the second-longest in NBA history. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **NBA Most Valuable Player**\n* LeBron James\u00a0\u2013 2009, 2010\n\n**NBA Rookie of the Year**\n* LeBron James\u00a0\u2013 2004\n* Kyrie Irving\u00a0\u2013 2012\n\n**NBA Coach of the Year**\n* Bill Fitch\u00a0\u2013 1976\n* Mike Brown\u00a0\u2013 2009\n\n**NBA Executive of the Year**\n* Wayne Embry\u00a0\u2013 1992, 1998\n\n**NBA Sportsmanship Award**\n* Terrell Brandon\u00a0\u2013 1997\n\n**J.

This also marks the team's first postseason basketball since 2017\u201318 and the first time a non-LeBron-led team qualified for postseason play since 1997\u201398. The team, however, didn't make it out of the play-in tournament, losing the 7-seed vs. 8-seed game to the Brooklyn Nets and the 8-seed vs. 9-seed game to the Atlanta Hawks, ending their season.\n\n\nOn March 26, 2023, the Cavaliers clinched a spot in the NBA playoffs, making this the first time since 2018 that the team entered the playoffs, with a 108\u201391 win over the Houston Rockets.

The franchise was purchased by Ted Stepien in 1980. Stepien's tenure as owner was marked by six coaching changes, questionable trades and draft decisions, and poor attendance, leading to $15 million in financial losses.

The team's alternate jersey was navy blue with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as a wine, gold and navy blue checkerboard trim.

The white Association uniforms have \"Cavs\" across the front, with wine color letters and numbers both front and back. All teams have the choice of which uniform to wear for any home game.

On the right pant leg, an outline of the Great Lakes (with Lake Erie highlighted) is featured with the slogan \"1 OUT OF 5 GREATS.\" For the home games in which these uniforms were worn, the floor at Quicken Loans Arena was modified with an orange and blue design, as well.[86] The same uniform design of the \"City Edition\" uniform was used for the team's \"Earned Edition\" uniform (exclusive to the 2018 NBA playoff teams), except the top part was white, while the bottom was powder blue and featured navy letters and numbers.[87]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCoinciding with the move to Gund Arena in the 1994\u201395 season, the Cavaliers changed logos and uniforms, adding black in addition to the already existing blue, orange and white colors. The uniforms feature a blue splash in the abdomen area in front. From 1994 to 1997, the word \"CAVS\" on the home uniforms was orange with black lines, while the numbers are in black with white lines; \"CLEVELAND\" on the road uniforms was also orange with black lines, while the numbers are in white with a black line. From 1997 to 1999, the numbers and lettering were slightly tweaked: The word \"CAVS\" and the numbers on the home uniforms were black with orange lines, while the word \"CLEVELAND\" and the numbers on the road uniforms were white with orange lines. In the latter iteration, the blue splash was moved from the right leg to the left leg, surrounding \"CLEVELAND\" on the home uniforms and \"CAVS\" on the road uniforms, with a minor change in striping.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1 pick in the 2003 NBA draft, selecting future NBA MVP LeBron James, a native of nearby Akron.[42] On January 3, 2005, the team was sold to businessman Dan Gilbert for $375 million,[43][44][45] and the deal was finalized on March 1, 2005.[46] That year, the team also hired head coach Mike Brown and general manager Danny Ferry.[47] The Cavaliers built a team around James and \u017dydr\u016bnas Ilgauskas by adding players such as Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes and Anderson Varajao.[48][49] Under this new leadership, the Cavaliers made five straight playoffs from 2006 to 2010, advancing to at least the second round each time.[38] The 2006\u201307 Cavaliers advanced to the franchise's first NBA Finals, but were swept by the San Antonio Spurs.[50][51] The 2008\u201309 Cavaliers won a franchise-record 66 games, including a franchise-best 39\u20132 record at home, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe inaugural class of Wall of Honor inductees included all personnel (players, coaches, executives, etc.) who have had their number retired or were honored with similar banners in the rafters, as well as the following:\n\n\n\n* Original owner Nick Mileti\n* Original general manager/head coach Bill Fitch\n* Former general manager Wayne Embry\n* Former forward John Johnson\n* Former forward/center John \"Hot Rod\" Williams\n\n\nAnother group of former Cavs personnel was added in 2022, including:\n\n\n\n* Former owner Gordon Gund\n* Former guard World B.

The drop shadows were also removed.

The former was inspired by Cleveland radio DJ Alan Freed, who popularized the phrase \"rock and roll\" and had called himself \"Moondog\". Moondog was an NBA All-Star selection in 2003 and 2004, and he made his first appearance on November 5, 2003. Sir C.C., a swashbuckler character, debuted during a game on November 27, 2010.[117]\n\n\n\n### Past[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, the Cavs had a polar bear mascot named Whammer, who was introduced on November 9, 1995. He still makes occasional appearances throughout the season at Cavaliers games.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n96. **^** Kroll, John (September 19, 2007). \"Cleveland Cavaliers open new practice facility\". *The Plain Dealer*.

The last time was in the 2012\u201313 season, when Carmelo Anthony won the 2013 scoring title and helped them win the Atlantic Division for the first time since 1994. The Knicks faced the Celtics, who were without Rajon Rondo because of a mid-season injury, in the 1st round of the 2013 playoffs. In both games 1 and 2, Celtics had a lead going into halftime but were held to 25 and 23 points respectively in the second half, which was an all-time low for the franchise in the playoffs. Knicks gained a 3\u20130 lead in the series, but Boston avoided elimination in games 4 and 5. In game six, Knicks once led by 26 points in the fourth quarter, then the Celtics went onto a 20\u20130 run in less than 5 minutes to make it a close game, but Knicks still won and moved on to round 2.\n\n\n\n### Brooklyn Nets[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Knicks\u2013Nets rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics are two of the three remaining teams from the original 1946 NBA (the other is the Golden State Warriors). The rivalry stems from the old rivalry between the cities of New York City and Boston, which is also mirrored in both the Yankees\u2013Red Sox and Jets\u2013Patriots rivalries. The fact that Boston and New York City are only 190 miles apart contributes to it.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Art Heyman\u00a0\u2013 1964\n* Jim Barnes\u00a0\u2013 1965\n* Howard Komives\u00a0\u2013 1965\n* Willis Reed\u00a0\u2013 1965\n* Dick Van Arsdale\u00a0\u2013 1966\n* Cazzie Russell\u00a0\u2013 1967\n* Walt Frazier\u00a0\u2013 1968\n* Phil Jackson\u00a0\u2013 1968\n* Bill Cartwright\u00a0\u2013 1980\n* Darrell Walker\u00a0\u2013 1984\n* Patrick Ewing\u00a0\u2013 1986\n* Mark Jackson\u00a0\u2013 1988\n* Channing Frye\u00a0\u2013 2006\n* Landry Fields\u00a0\u2013 2011\n* Iman Shumpert\u00a0\u2013 2012\n* Tim Hardaway Jr.\u00a0\u2013 2014\n* Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is\u00a0\u2013 2016\n* Willy Hernang\u00f3mez\u00a0\u2013 2017\n\n\n**NBA All-Rookie Second Team**\n\n\n\n* Rod Strickland\u00a0\u2013 1989\n* Langston Galloway\u00a0\u2013 2015\n* Mitchell Robinson\u00a0\u2013 2019\n* Immanuel Quickley\u00a0\u2013 2021\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### Boston Celtics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Knicks\u2013Celtics rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 season, the Knicks traded Charles Oakley to the Toronto Raptors for Marcus Camby while also trading John Starks in a package to the Golden State Warriors for 1994's 1st team all-league shooting guard Latrell Sprewell (whose contract was voided by the Warriors after choking Warriors' head coach P. J. Carlesimo during the previous season). After barely getting into the playoffs with a 27\u201323 record, the Knicks started a Cinderella run. It started with the Knicks eliminating the #1 seeded Heat in the first round after Allan Houston bounced in a running one-hander off the front of the rim, high off the backboard, and in with 0.8 seconds left in the deciding 5th game.

The team, who acquired Derek Harper in a midseason trade with the Dallas Mavericks, once again won the Atlantic Division with a 57\u201325 record. In the playoffs, the team played a then NBA-record 25 games (the Boston Celtics played 26 games in the 2008 playoffs); they started by defeating the New Jersey Nets in the first round before finally getting past the Bulls, defeating them in the second round in seven games. In the Eastern Conference Finals, they faced the Indiana Pacers, who at one point held a three games-to-two lead. They had this advantage thanks to the exploits of Reggie Miller, who scored 25 fourth-quarter points in Game 5 to lead the Pacers to victory. However, the Knicks won the next two games to reach their first NBA Finals since 1973.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe playoff-level Knicks of the 1990s were led by future Hall of Fame center Patrick Ewing; this era was marked by passionate rivalries with the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers, and Miami Heat. During this time, they were known for playing tough defense under head coaches Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy, making NBA Finals appearances in 1994 and 1999. However, they were unable to win an NBA championship during this era.\n\n\nSince 2000, the Knicks have struggled to regain their former successes, but won their first division title in 19 years in 2012\u201313, led by a core of forwards Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire. They were eventually eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Indiana Pacers, and had failed to make the playoffs for eight years until 2020\u201321 when they were led by forward Julius Randle and sophomore RJ Barrett, who was selected third overall in the 2019 NBA draft.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of New York Knicks seasons\n\n### 1946\u20131967: early years[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Knicks.

The team plays its home games at Madison Square Garden, an arena they share with the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL).

The Knicks drafted center Willis Reed, who made an immediate impact on the court and was named NBA Rookie of the Year for his efforts.[24] However, the leaders of the team still remained in flux. In an attempt to reorganize, the Knicks named former standout Harry Gallatin as head coach while reassigning Donovan to general manager position.[33] After a slow start in 1965, Dick McGuire, another former Knick, replaced his former teammate Gallatin midway through the season.[30] Though he failed to guide the Knicks to the playoffs in 1965, he managed to do so the following season, however, the Knicks lost in the Eastern Division semi-finals.[30]\n\n\n\n### 1967\u20131975: championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nWillis Reed and Walt \"Clyde\" Frazier, under coach Red Holzman, brought the Knicks two NBA Championships in the early 1970s\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Carl Braun\u00a0\u2013 1948, 1954\n* Dick McGuire\u00a0\u2013 1951\n* Harry Gallatin\u00a0\u2013 1955\n* Richie Guerin\u00a0\u2013 1959, 1960, 1962\n* Willis Reed\u00a0\u2013 1967\u20131969, 1971\n* Dave DeBusschere\u00a0\u2013 1969\n* Walt Frazier\u00a0\u2013 1971, 1973\n* Patrick Ewing\u00a0\u2013 1988, 1989, 1991\u20131993, 1997\n* Amar'e Stoudemire\u00a0\u2013 2011\n* Carmelo Anthony\u00a0\u2013 2013\n* Julius Randle\u00a0\u2013 2021\n\n\n**All-NBA Third Team**\n\n\n\n* Carmelo Anthony\u00a0\u2013 2012\n* Tyson Chandler\u00a0\u2013 2012\n* Julius Randle\u00a0\u2013 2023\n\n\n**NBA All-Defensive First Team**\n\n\n\n* Dave DeBusschere\u00a0\u2013 1969\u20131974\n* Walt Frazier\u00a0\u2013 1969\u20131975\n* Willis Reed\u00a0\u2013 1970\n* Micheal Ray Richardson\u00a0\u2013 1981\n* Charles Oakley\u00a0\u2013 1994\n* Tyson Chandler\u00a0\u2013 2013\n\n\n**NBA All-Defensive Second Team**\n\n\n\n* Patrick Ewing\u00a0\u2013 1988, 1989, 1992\n* John Starks\u00a0\u2013 1993\n* Charles Oakley\u00a0\u2013 1998\n* Tyson Chandler\u00a0\u2013 2012\n**NBA All-Rookie First Team**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe loss denied New York the distinction of having both NBA and NHL championships in the same year.

They met in the playoffs 6 times from 1993 to 2000, fueling a rivalry epitomized by the enmity between Reggie Miller and prominent Knick fan Spike Lee. Miller likened it to the Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud, and The New York Times said in 1998 that it was \"as combustible as any in the league\".\nThe rivalry gave Miller the nickname \"The Knick-Killer\". His clutch performances were frequently followed by jabs at Lee like the choke sign, adding fuel to the rivalry. The rivalry renewed during the 2013 NBA playoffs in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, with Indiana taking the series 4 games to 2.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Knicks\u2013Heat rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn November 21, 2008, the Knicks dealt one of their top scorers, Jamal Crawford, to the Golden State Warriors for Al Harrington.[107] Hours later, New York traded Zach Randolph, along with Mardy Collins, to the Los Angeles Clippers for Cuttino Mobley and Tim Thomas, with the intention of freeing cap space for the 2010 off-season, when top-flight players such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and Amar'e Stoudemire would be available.[107] In February 2009, the Knicks traded Tim Thomas, Jerome James, and Anthony Roberson to the Chicago Bulls for Larry Hughes, in addition to sending Malik Rose to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Chris Wilcox.[108][109]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n131. **^** \"Knicks Acquire Four-Time All-Star Carmelo Anthony\". *NYKnicks.com*.

The Knicks were successful during their early years and were constant playoff contenders under the franchise's first head coach Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, all of which were losing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began to falter.\n\n\nIt was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzman became the head coach that the Knicks began to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided the Knicks to two NBA championships, in 1970 and 1973. The Knicks of the 1980s had mixed success that included six playoff appearances; however, they failed to participate in the NBA Finals.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1996\u201397 season, the Knicks, with the additions of such players as Larry Johnson and Allan Houston, registered a 57\u201325 record. In the playoffs, the Knicks swept the Charlotte Hornets in the first round before facing the Miami Heat (coached by Riley) in the second round. The Knicks took a 3\u20131 lead in the series before a brawl near the end of Game 5 resulted in suspensions of key players. Many of the suspended Knicks players, Ewing in particular, were disciplined not for participating in the altercation itself, but for violating an NBA rule stipulating that a benched player may not leave the bench during a fight (the rule was subsequently amended, making it illegal to leave the \"bench area\"). With Ewing and Houston suspended for Game 6, Johnson and Starks suspended for Game 7, and Charlie Ward suspended for both, the Knicks lost the series.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnder his direction, the Knicks went 28\u201317 and finished with a 43\u201339 record thus salvaging a playoff berth, however, the Knicks were again vanquished in the Eastern Division semi-finals by the Philadelphia 76ers.[30] However their roster was slowly coming together piece by piece. Rookies Phil Jackson and Walt Frazier were named to the NBA All-Rookie Team while Dick Barnett and Willis Reed performed in the 1968 NBA All-Star Game.[24]\n\n\nThe following season, the team acquired Dave DeBusschere from the Detroit Pistons, and the team went 54\u201328.[30][37] In the playoffs, New York made it past the first round of contention for the first time since 1953, sweeping the Baltimore Bullets in four games, before falling to the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Division finals.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1 Also served as a broadcaster.\n* 2 Also served as head coach (1965\u20131968) and scouting director.\n* 3 Also served as head coach (1977\u20131978).\n* 4 As head coach; the number represents his 613 victories coaching the Knicks.\n* 5 Number retired twice, first for Monroe and six years later for McGuire.[239]\n* The NBA retired Bill Russell's No. 6 for all its member teams on August 11, 2022.[240][241]\n\n\n### Basketball Hall of Famers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Annual events | Draft\neligibility\nSummer League\nChristmas\nMartin Luther King Jr. Day\nAll-Star weekend\ngame\nGlobal Games\nCup tournament\nPlay-in\nPlayoffs\nlist\nfinals\nchampions\n |\n| History | Predecessors\nBAA\nNBL\nABA\nmerger\nWalter A.

The Knicks then signed veteran power forward Kenyon Martin to a 10-day contract. In late March, the Knicks went on to compile a four-game losing streak, tying their worst skid of the season. They would go on and face the Jazz on the road, eventually winning the game and starting what would turn out to be a 13-game winning streak, including wins against the Miami Heat and the Oklahoma City Thunder. This was the third-longest winning streak in franchise history. On April 9, the Knicks beat the Washington Wizards to secure the Atlantic Division title for the first time since the 1993\u201394 NBA season. The Knicks' 13-game winning streak came to an end on April 11 as they lost to the Chicago Bulls. Despite that, they set the NBA single-season record for three-pointers. On May 3, the Knicks defeated the Boston Celtics in the first round of the NBA playoffs, 4\u20132, their first playoff victory since 2000. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rivalry was dormant through much of the 2000s, with both teams rebuilding after the retirements of Patrick Ewing and Michael Jordan. However, with the arrival of future NBA MVP Derrick Rose in 2008, the Chicago Bulls began experiencing success once again. In the summer of 2010, the Bulls signed Carlos Boozer and the Knicks signed Amar'e Stoudemire, making both teams playoff contenders once again. Carmelo Anthony and Tyson Chandler joined the Knicks soon after, and the rivalry between the two teams appears to have been reborn.\n\n\n\n### Indiana Pacers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Knicks\u2013Pacers rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter defeating the Atlanta Hawks in the second round four games to none, they faced the Pacers yet again in the Eastern Conference Finals. Despite losing Ewing to injury for the rest of the playoffs prior to Game 3, the Knicks won the series (aided in part to a four-point play by Larry Johnson in the final seconds of Game 3) to become the first eighth-seeded playoff team to make it to the NBA Finals. However, in the Finals, the San Antonio Spurs, with superstars David Robinson and Tim Duncan, proved too much for the injury-laden Knicks, who lost in five games. The remarkable fifth game of this Finals is remembered for its 2nd half scoring duel between the Spurs' Tim Duncan and the Knicks' Latrell Sprewell, and was decided by a long jumper by Avery Johnson with 47 seconds left to clinch the title for the Spurs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNational Basketball Association team in New York City\n\nThis article is about the professional basketball team.

With multiple players still serving a suspension as a result of the brawl, on December 20, 2006, David Lee created one of the most memorable plays in recent Knicks history, and served as a bright spot as the team's struggles persisted, during a game against the Charlotte Bobcats.

The throwback set they wore that season represented the franchise's first season in 1946\u201347. However, both the blue and white throwbacks featured blue letters with orange trim (the originals had only orange letters on the blue uniform and blue letters on the white uniform minus any additional trim).\n\n\nIn the 2004\u201305 season, the Knicks wore throwback white uniforms from the \"maroon era\" of the early 1980s. The only difference from the originals was that the letters on the player's name were arranged in a radial arch (the originals were designed in a vertical arch) and were smaller in size.\n\n\nThe following season, the Knicks wore throwback blue checkerboard uniforms from the mid-1950s, which featured the \"Father Knickerbocker\" logo on the left leg (the originals did not feature said logo).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Knicks would introduce an iconic logo that would endure for the next three decades. Designed by Bud Freeman, the word \"Knicks\" superimposed over a brown basketball is known as the \"classic roundball logo\", with minor changes throughout its lifespan such as maroon wordmark and orange basketball.[3] An alternate logo featuring the full team name inside an orange basketball was used during the late 1960s and into the 1970s. As the 1960s began, the Knicks updated their uniforms again. This time the lettering is in serifed fonts, and the blue lettering and numbers on the home uniforms are now trimmed in orange. The away uniforms maintained the orange lettering but added white trim; it later changed to white letters while adding white trim on the piping. Side stripes were also added to the uniform. The \"NY\" monogram is on the left leg of the shorts.\n\n\n\n#### 1968\u20131979; 1983\u20131997: championship era uniforms[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Sphere, the Next-Generation Entertainment Venue, Named the New York Knicks Official Jersey Patch Partner\". *NYKnicks.com* (Press release).

President David Checketts reached out to Pat Riley, who was working as a commentator for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), to see if he was interested in returning to coaching. Riley accepted the Knicks proposition on May 31, 1991.[67] Riley, who coached the Lakers to four NBA titles during the 1980s, implemented a rough and physical style emphasizing defense.[67] Under Riley, the team, led by Ewing and guard John Starks, who scored 24 points per game and 13.9 points per game respectively, improved to a 51\u201331 record, tying them for first place in the Atlantic Division.[68][69] After defeating the Pistons in the first round of the playoffs, the team faced the Bulls, losing the series 4\u20133 in seven games.[69] The 1992\u201393 season proved to be even more successful, as the Knicks won the Atlantic Division with a 60\u201322 record. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 1999\u20132000 season, would prove to be the last one in New York for Ewing, as the Knicks, who had a 50\u201332 record that season swept the Toronto Raptors a team led by Vince Carter, Antonio Davis and a young Tracy McGrady in three games in the first round, defeated the Miami Heat in another dramatic seven-game series in which Ewing's dunk with over a minute remaining in game 7, provided the winning margin in a 1-point road victory. They would, however, lose in the Eastern Conference Finals to the Reggie Miller-led Indiana Pacers in six games. After the season, Ewing was traded[71] on September 20, 2000, to the Seattle SuperSonics, and the Ewing era, which produced many successful playoff appearances but no NBA championship titles, came to an end.[72]\n\n\n\n### 2000\u20132003: downfall[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

This was the second consecutive year that the Raptors clinched the Atlantic Division title.[150] On April 11, 2015, the Raptors beat the Miami Heat, Toronto's first road win over the Heat since November 19, 2008, ending a ten-game slide on Miami's home floor. The win was Toronto's 48th of the season and 22nd on the road, both tying franchise records.[151] Four days later, the Raptors broke their franchise record with their 49th win of the season.

The Raptors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Scotiabank Arena, which it shares with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team was founded in 1995 as part of the NBA's expansion into Canada, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies. Since the 2001\u201302 season, the Raptors have been the only Canadian-based team in the league, as the Grizzlies relocated from Vancouver to Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite resting Leonard for more than 20 games due to his injury from the previous season, the Raptors finished the regular season with the second seed in the East, and the second-best record in the league behind the Milwaukee Bucks.[168] The Raptors faced the Orlando Magic in the first round of the 2019 playoffs, defeating them in five games.[176] In the following round, the Raptors defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in a tightly contested seven-game series. In the closing seconds of Game 7 with the game tied, Leonard hit the game-winning 15-foot buzzer-beater to lift the Raptors to a 92\u201390 victory\u2014the first Game 7 buzzer-beater in NBA playoff history.[177] They went on to face the Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nToronto attempted to try for the game-winning shot, but Jefferson intercepted a pass to seal the series for the Nets.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nJorge Garbajosa (left) and Chris Bosh (right) during the 2007\u201308 season.

The Raptors won the division final but then faced the Nets in the opening round of the 2014 NBA Playoffs. Prior to Game 1 of the series, Raptors' general manager Masai Ujiri spoke at a Raptors rally outside Air Canada Centre's Maple Leaf Square. During the rally, Ujiri yelled \"Fuck Brooklyn!\" which found its way onto various social media platforms within minutes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs predicted by analysts, the team easily secured a berth in the 2001 NBA playoffs with a franchise-high 47 wins. The Raptors won their first ever playoff series as they defeated New York 3\u20132, advancing to the Eastern Conference semifinals for the first time in franchise history.[57][60] Wilkens was praised for having Williams defend shooting guard Allan Houston and Carter defend small forward Latrell Sprewell, the two major Knicks offensive threats. The series with Philadelphia 76ers was a landmark for the Raptors in terms of performance and entertainment value. The Sixers relied on Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo for their respective offensive and defensive abilities, along with steady help from Aaron McKie. Toronto was the more balanced team with Carter, Alvin Williams and Davis providing much of the offensive game and Chris Childs and Jerome Williams on defence. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Young, Chris (May 25, 1994). \"'Piston for life' Thomas named Raptors' GM NBA superstar to have 10% stake in new franchise\". *Toronto Star*.\n20. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Campbell, Neil (December 29, 1995). \"Thomas to double stake in Raptors Price undisclosed, but thought to be bargain for Toronto GM\". *The Globe and Mail*.\n21. **^** Young, Chris (August 13, 1995). \"Raptors' Thomas 'voice of reason' in NBA talks\". *Toronto Star*.\n22. **^** Israelson, David (October 19, 1995). \"Thomas is key player on Raptors' court He handles everything but the ball for new basketball squad\". *Toronto Star*.\n23. **^** \"Thomas to up stake in Raptors\". *The Vancouver Sun*.

The Nets took home court advantage in Game 1, holding off a late Raptors rally in the fourth quarter. The Raptors pulled away in another tight game to even the series at one game apiece. When the series shifted to New Jersey, the Nets took charge of the series, winning Games 3 and 4 in routs. New Jersey had a chance to win the series in game 5 in Toronto, but the Raptors took a 20-point lead after one quarter. Still, New Jersey chipped away and had a chance to win the game, but Bo\u0161tjan Nachbar's three-pointer missed at the buzzer. Needing to win in New Jersey to force a game 7, Toronto held a one-point lead with under a minute to play in game 6, but Richard Jefferson hit a layup with eight seconds left to play. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn May 24, 1994, the team's logo and first general manager, Isiah Thomas, were revealed at a press conference.[1] As part of the deal, Thomas received an option to purchase part of the team, reportedly for under market value.[19][20] He would purchase 4.5 per cent in May 1995[21][22] and a further 4.5 per cent in December 1995,[20][23] half each from Bitove and Slaight, decreasing their share to 39.5 per cent.[1][24] The team's colours of bright red, purple, black, and silver were also revealed; \"Naismith\" silver was chosen to honour Canadian James Naismith, the inventor of basketball.[1] The team originally competed in the Central Division,[25] and before the inaugural season began, sales of Raptors merchandise ranked seventh in the league, marking a successful return of professional basketball to Canada.[1]\n\n\n\n### 1995\u20131999: Struggles of a new franchise[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2020, the Raptors went on a 15-game winning streak and set a new record for the longest winning streak by a Canadian-based professional sports franchise.[217]\n\n\n\n## Broadcasters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Toronto Raptors broadcasters\n\nRaptors games are primarily broadcast on television by Canadian sports channels TSN and Sportsnet, owned by Bell Media and Rogers Communications, respectively. Through MLSE, the Raptors also operate the Canadian version of NBA TV (formerly known as Raptors NBA TV), which airs reruns of Raptors telecasts along with other news and analysis programs focusing on the team and the rest of the NBA.[218] During the 2019 NBA Finals, for simultaneous substitution purposes, Citytv (for games aired by Sportsnet)[219] and CTV 2 (for games aired by TSN) aired the ABC feed.[220]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBefore the 2021\u201322 season, the Raptors signed and traded Lowry to the Miami Heat for Goran Dragi\u0107 and Precious Achiuwa.[193] On September 10, 2021, the Canadian government allowed the Raptors to return to Scotiabank Arena for the first time since March 2020, requiring spectators to show a proof of COVID-19 vaccination to attend.[194] Despite a multitude of injuries to key players, the Raptors won 48 games to return to the postseason, entering the 2022 NBA playoffs as the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. However, the Raptors would lose to the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round in six games, after going down 0\u20133 to start the series.[195] Siakam was named to his second All-NBA Team, tying Vince Carter and Demar DeRozan for the most All-NBA selections in Raptors history. Scottie Barnes, whom the Raptors had selected fourth overall in the 2021 NBA draft, was named the 2022 NBA Rookie of the Year.[196][197]\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs general manager, Isiah Thomas quickly staffed the management positions with his own personnel, naming long-time Detroit Pistons assistant Brendan Malone as the Raptors' head coach.[1] The team's roster was then filled as a result of an expansion draft in 1995. Following a coin flip, Toronto was given first choice and selected Chicago Bulls point guard and three-point specialist B. J. Armstrong.[1] Armstrong refused to report to the club, and Thomas promptly traded him to the Golden State Warriors for power forwards Carlos Rogers and Victor Alexander.[26] Thomas then selected a wide range of players in the expansion draft, including veterans Jerome Kersey, Willie Anderson and his former Pistons teammate John Salley.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Raptors opened a new practice facility, the OVO Athletic Centre, originally known as the BioSteel Centre, in Exhibition Place, on February 10, 2016. The Raptors hosted the 2016 NBA All-Star Game on February 14, 2016, and its associated weekend for the first time in its history. With a 105\u201397 win at home against the Atlanta Hawks on March 30, 2016, the Raptors attained their first-ever 50-win season.[154] The following day the Raptors clinched the Atlantic Division title for the third consecutive season as a result of a Boston Celtics loss against the Portland Trail Blazers.[155] The 56\u201326 record became the best Raptors regular season ever, fourth overall in the league and second only to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference. Entering the 2016 playoffs as the East's second seed,[156] the Raptors were pushed to seven games by the Indiana Pacers, but won their first playoff series in 15 years.[157] Another seven-game series against the Miami Heat ensued, which Toronto also won. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Carter left, Chris Bosh emerged as the team leader. For the 2006\u201307 season, Bryan Colangelo was appointed as general manager, and through a combination of Bosh, 2006 first overall draft pick Andrea Bargnani, and a revamp of the roster, the Raptors qualified for their first playoff berth in five years, capturing the Atlantic Division title. In the 2007\u201308 season, they also advanced to the playoffs but failed to reach the postseason in each of the next five seasons. Colangelo overhauled the team's roster for the 2009\u201310 season in a bid to persuade pending free agent Bosh to stay, but Bosh departed to sign with the Miami Heat in July 2010, ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSeveral changes to the roster were made before the 2007\u201308 campaign as Toronto sought to reproduce the same form as the previous campaign. Most notably, the Raptors acquired Carlos Delfino in a trade with Detroit for two second-round draft picks,[115] and signed Jamario Moon[116] and three-point specialist Jason Kapono as free agents.[117] On the other hand, veteran swingman Morris Peterson joined the New Orleans Hornets.[118] Despite being defending division champions, the Raptors were widely tipped as outside contenders for the division and conference titles.[119] However, Toronto quickly fell behind Boston in the division, as Bargnani's inability to play well consistently, along with injuries to Garbajosa (75 games), Bosh (15 games) and Ford (31 games), derailed the possibility of a smooth campaign.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the Raptors won their first championship, Leonard left in free agency and Siakam became the face of the franchise.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\nOn November 1, 1946, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, in what was the first game played in NBA history (as the Basketball Association of America). However, the Huskies folded after the initial 1946\u201347 season.[9] Toronto did not host another NBA game until the 1970s, when the Buffalo Braves (predecessor to the Los Angeles Clippers) played a total of 16 regular season games at Maple Leaf Gardens from 1971 to 1975.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMaple Leaf Sports & Entertainment\n |\n| --- |\n| Founded in 1931 as **Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd.**\n |\n| Teams | * Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL) (1931\u2013present)\n* Toronto Raptors (NBA) (1998\u2013present)\n* Toronto FC (MLS) (2005\u2013present)\n* Toronto Argonauts (CFL) (2018\u2013present)\n* Toronto Marlies (AHL) (2005\u2013present)\n* Raptors 905 (NBA G League) (2015\u2013present)\n* Toronto FC II (MLSNP) (2014\u2013present)\n |\n| Venues | * Scotiabank Arena\n* BMO Field (operator)\n* Coca-Cola Coliseum (primary lessee)\n* Ford Performance Centre (operator)\n* OVO Athletic Centre (operator)\n* BMO Training Ground (operator)\n* Lamport Stadium (partnership)\n |\n| People | * Larry Tanenbaum\n* Michael Friisdahl\n* George A.

The season was also the first full year played at the Air Canada Centre, after having played four years at the cavernous SkyDome, which was better suited to baseball and Canadian football.[54] Overall, the Raptors concluded the season with a 45\u201337 record.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first half of the season produced mixed results as Toronto struggled towards the .500 mark.[103] After the All-Star break, Bargnani continued to work on his defence and shooting (averaging 14.3 points per game and 3.9 rebounds per game in 12 games for the month of February 2007), and he was selected as the Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for the second straight time on March 1, 2007.[104] Bargnani became the third Raptor ever to win the award twice, joining Vince Carter and Damon Stoudamire.[104] Toronto ended the regular season with a 47\u201335 record, securing the third seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2007 NBA playoffs along with the Atlantic Division title, as well as homecourt advantage for the first time in franchise history.[105][106] Bosh was voted to start in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game.[107] The Raptors were also praised for their improved defence, ball-sharing and tremendous team chemistry.[108] Colangelo, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** NBA Playoffs 2001, nba.com, accessed June 16, 2007.\n61. **^** Associated Press.

From the 2008\u221209 season through the 2014\u221215 season, the Raptors unveiled their alternate black road uniforms, which were actually worn as often as the primary red ones.\n\n\n\n1995\u22121998\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Home jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Home**\n | ![](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Bryan Colangelo (right) at a Raptors game in 2009.

After 50 games, Toronto was 25\u201325 and in a position to make the playoffs, but injuries to key players sent the Raptors plummeting down the standings. Rose, Carter and Alvin Williams all suffered injuries as the Raptors struggled to a record of 8\u201324 in their remaining games.[74] The notable individual season performances were Carter's 22.5 ppg, Marshall's 10.7 rpg, and rookie Bosh, a 6\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.08\u00a0m) forward-centre, averaging 11.5\u00a0ppg and 7.4\u00a0rpg and being named to the NBA All-Rookie Team.[75] Williams' knee injury turned out to be career-ending.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 2016\u201317 NBA season, the Raptors not only unveiled the season's \"retro\" uniforms in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Toronto Huskies, but also revealed a Huskies-themed throwback court.[202] The franchise also launched a special red Chinese New Year jersey in celebration of the event. The Chinese New Year jersey features a stylized rendering of \"Toronto\" in white traditional Chinese characters (\u591a\u502b\u591a, Pinyin: *Du\u014dl\u00fandu\u014d*, Wade-Giles: To1-lun2-to1) with the head of a leftward-facing (viewer's perspective) Chinese dragon replacing the upper half of the first \u591a character and the Raptors slashed basketball logo replacing much of the bottom half of the \u502b character.[203]\n\n\nOther jerseys worn by the Raptors include a green uniform worn from the 2007\u221208 season through to the 2011\u221212 season on St. Patrick's Day.[204]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Raptors have enjoyed a consistent fanbase throughout their history. They set NBA attendance records in their 2000, 2001, and 2002 seasons when they made the playoffs. Attendance dipped slightly between 2003 and 2006. This improved during the 2006\u201307 regular season to an average of 18,258 fans (13th in the league), 92.2 per cent of capacity at the Air Canada Centre.[221] Following the success of the 2006\u201307 season, Toronto became one of the league leaders in season ticket sales for the 2007\u201308 season.[222]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMasai Ujiri replaced Colangelo in 2013 and helped herald a new era of success, led by a backcourt duo of DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. The Raptors returned to the playoffs the following year and became a consistent playoff team in every year of Ujiri's tenure. Under Ujiri, the team also won five Division titles and registered their most successful regular season in 2018. However, the team's failure to reach the NBA Finals prompted Ujiri to fire head coach Dwane Casey after the 2018 playoffs concluded and to trade DeRozan for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green later that summer, as well as to acquire Marc Gasol before the trade deadline. Toronto also saw the breakout of Pascal Siakam, the 27th overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft, who won the NBA Most Improved Player that year. In the 2019 playoffs, the Raptors won their first Eastern Conference title and advanced to their first NBA Finals, where they won their first NBA championship.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs with most expansion teams, the Raptors struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft-day trade in 1998, the franchise set league-attendance records and made the NBA playoffs in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Carter was instrumental in leading the team to their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals. During the 2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304 seasons, they failed to make significant progress, and Carter was traded in 2004 to the New Jersey Nets.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n167. **^** \"Spurs obtain Demar DeRozan, Jacob Poeltl and first round pick from raptors in exchange for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green\". *www.nba.com*.

Kevin Willis, another veteran acquired from the trade, solidified the centre position, while the coaching staff temporarily rotated Brown, Williams and Doug Christie to play point guard. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. **^** \"NBA at a Glance / Daily Report\". *Los Angeles Times*.

The team's original colours were purple, bright red, black and \"Naismith silver\" (in honour of the Canadian inventor of basketball, James Naismith). The logo proved to be very popular among fans, as by the end of 1994, the Raptors were seventh in the league in merchandise sales.[1] For the 2008\u221209 season, the franchise dropped the colour purple from the original logo, making bright red the predominant colour in both the logo and the team's jerseys.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Raptors finished 41\u201341, six fewer wins than the previous season, but still good enough for a playoff spot as the sixth seed. They were pitted against Dwight Howard and the resurgent Orlando Magic. In Game 1, Dwight Howard gave the Magic their first playoff win since 2003 as they practically led the entire game.[120] Howard would put up a 29\u201320 in Game 2, as Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu scored the final four go-ahead points to give the Magic a 2\u20130 lead. The Raptors would respond with a strong Game 3 victory keyed by great point guard play from Ford and Jos\u00e9 Calderon. However, Jameer Nelson, Rashard Lewis and Keith Bogans keyed strong three-point shooting in Game 4 and overcame Bosh's 39 points and 15 rebounds to bring the Magic out of Toronto with a 3\u20131 lead. Howard would finish off the series in Game 5 as impressively as he started: 21 points, 21 rebounds, 3 blocks.[121][122] Whereas the preceding season was considered a success, the 2007\u201308 campaign was considered a disappointment. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe team was formalized on November 4, 1993, when the NBA Board of Governors endorsed the decision of Expansion Committee and awarded its 28th franchise to a group headed by Toronto businessman John Bitove for a then-record expansion fee of US$125 million.[1][12] Bitove and Allan Slaight of Slaight Communications each owned 44 per cent, with the Bank of Nova Scotia (10 per cent), David Peterson (1 per cent), and Phil Granovsky (1 per cent) being minority partners.[1][13] Wagering on NBA games in Ontario nearly cost Toronto the expansion franchise, due to strict league rules at the time that prohibited gambling. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** Smith, Doug (November 16, 1996). \"Allan Slaight wins control of Raptors\". *The Kingston Whig-Standard*.\n35. **^** \"Slaight maps out the future: Bitove bows out of Raptors' life\". *The Hamilton Spectator*.

The team said in a press release that the new uniform designs were intended to pay tribute to the city of Toronto and to Canada as a whole, noting that the Raptors were the sole Canadian club in the NBA since the Grizzlies' move to Memphis. The main colours would remain centred on Canada's national colours of red and white, whereas black and silver will continue to be used for trim on the white home and red road uniforms. The uniforms themselves underwent changes. Most notably, the chevrons on the side panels now point up, which the team said aligns with its current slogan of \"We The North\". Since being introduced as a uniform accent in 1999, the chevrons had pointed downward, the team said. In addition, at the waist-level hem of the jersey is an upside-down tag with the team's \"We The North\" slogan. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Toronto Raptors unveiled a new primary logo, which the team described as \"a circular shield with a ball torn by the unmistakable attack of a Raptor\".[198]\n\n\n\n#### Court art[edit]\n\n\nThe Toronto Raptors used various court art over the team's existence. For retro games, the Raptors used the Huskies logo, given that the Raptors are among the newest NBA teams. Beginning in early 2018, in some games, the Raptors use the Welcome Toronto logo, as the Raptors have strong connections with Toronto-based rapper Drake, as well as the 3D Raptors logo. Scotiabank subsidiary Tangerine Bank's name and logo are printed on the court as well (Tangerine Bank was formerly ING Direct Canada, until Scotiabank purchased the company in 2012 and re-branded it in 2013).\n\n\n\n### Uniforms[edit]\n\n\n#### Uniform evolution[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2018, Drake unveiled the Welcome Toronto program with the Raptors. As a part of the program, the Raptors wore \"city edition\" uniforms for six home games throughout the 2017\u201318 season. As a salute to the earlier We the North campaign, the uniforms feature a gold chevron with \"NORTH\" written across it. The six Welcome Toronto home games also featured an OVO-themed black and gold home court, with chevrons pointing north.[247] In addition to the Welcome Toronto home games, it was also announced that the Raptors and OVO would donate $1 million in order to refurbish local community basketball courts, as well as another $2 million to Canada Basketball.[248]\n\n\n\n### Community service[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs it turned out, a blockbuster trade was agreed in principle before the 2008\u201309 campaign: six-time All-Star Jermaine O'Neal was acquired from the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Ford (who had become expendable with the emergence of Calder\u00f3n), Rasho Nesterovi\u0107, Maceo Baston, and Roy Hibbert, the 17th pick in the 2008 NBA draft, giving the Raptors a potential boost in the frontcourt.[123] Meanwhile, Bargnani, who had spent the summer working on his interior game, was projected to come off the bench. The Raptors also introduced a black alternate road jersey for the season similar to the earlier purple design that was dropped a few seasons ago. It had a maple leaf featured on the back neck of the jersey, symbolizing the Raptors as \"Canada's team\".[124] Despite the introduction of O'Neal, who brought home the rebounds and the blocks, and a much improved Bargnani, the Raptors were too inconsistent. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt times, footage from the square is broadcast to the Raptors locker room.[224][225] The victorious Game 7 against the Indiana Pacers on the 2016 playoffs was the most-watched Raptors broadcast ever and the biggest television audience in Canada that day, averaging 1.53 million viewers with a peak of 2.63 million.[226] This record has since been broken during the Raptors' victorious 2019 playoff run, averaging 7.7 million viewers with a peak of 10 million.[227]\n\n\nThe value of the Raptors franchise has risen over the years. In 1998, the franchise was bought for US$125\u00a0million. With the continued popularity of the Raptors, the value of the franchise doubled from US$148\u00a0million in 2000 to $297\u00a0million in 2004. The value of the franchise grew again from $315\u00a0million in 2006 to $373\u00a0million in 2007, and $400\u00a0million in 2008. By 2018, *Forbes* estimated the Raptors were worth $1.4\u00a0billion, 12th in the NBA.[228][229][230][231][232][233]\n\n\n\nSee also: List of NBA mascots\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn January 30, 2013, the Raptors acquired Memphis Grizzlies star Rudy Gay and centre Hamed Haddadi as well as Pistons player Austin Daye in a three-way deal that sent Calder\u00f3n to the Detroit Pistons and Davis, along with Pistons veteran Tayshaun Prince and a second-round pick to the Grizzlies. Haddadi was later traded, along with a second-round pick, to Phoenix in exchange for guard Sebastian Telfair. The 2012\u201313 season was the first season since 2009\u201310 that the Raptors finished the season with a winning home record (21\u201320), despite their overall losing record (34\u201348).\n\n\n\n### 2013\u2013present: The Masai Ujiri era and continued success[edit]\n\n\n#### 2013\u20132018: The DeRozan and Lowry era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Brown as a team in the Basketball Association of America. In 1948, the team earned its first playoff appearance, only to lose to the Chicago Stags 4\u20131. In 1949, the team missed the playoffs, fifth in the Eastern Division. Then, on August 3, 1949, the team became part of the National Basketball Association after the absorption of the National Basketball League by the BAA.[13] In 1950, the Celtics signed Chuck Cooper, becoming the first NBA franchise to draft a black player.[14] Chuck Connors of *The Rifleman* fame was an original member of the Celtics in 1946.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Celtics completed the largest single-season turnaround in NBA history. The team went 66\u201316 in the regular season, a 42-game improvement over its 2006\u201307 record. However, the team struggled in the early rounds of the playoffs, needing seven games to defeat the Atlanta Hawks in the first round and another seven to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference semifinals. The Celtics then beat the Detroit Pistons in six games in the Eastern Conference Finals, winning two road games.[106]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 2011 NBA playoffs started with the Celtics sweeping the New York Knicks 4\u20130 in the opening round. In the second round, they were ousted by eventual Eastern Conference champions Miami Heat in five games.

In 1964, the Celtics became the first NBA team to have an all African-American starting lineup. On December 26, 1964, Willie Naulls replaced an injured Tom Heinsohn, joining Tom 'Satch' Sanders, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, and Bill Russell in the starting lineup. The Celtics defeated St. Louis 97\u201384. Boston won its next 11 games with Naulls starting in place of Heinsohn.[26] The Celtics of the late 1950s\u20131960s are widely considered one of the most dominant teams of all time.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n176. **^** \"Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov's win-at-all-costs mentality is reminiscent of late George Steinbrenner\". *NY Daily News*.

On the team's opening night game in the first quarter against the Cavaliers, Hayward suffered a fractured tibia and dislocated ankle in his left leg,[141] causing him to be ruled out for the rest of the regular season.[142] Despite the loss, the Celtics went on a 16-game winning streak, which also went down as the fourth-longest winning streak in the teams' history.[143] The streak started with a 102\u201392 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on October 20 and ended on November 22 to the hands of the Miami Heat with a 104\u201398 loss. The Celtics finished the year with a 55\u201327 record, good enough for second place in the Eastern Conference. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1980s, the Celtics returned to dominance, as well as renewed competition with the \"Showtime\" Lakers, who were led by Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Anchored by the \"Big Three\" of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, the Celtics won championships in 1981, 1984, and 1986. The team defeated the Lakers in the 1984 Finals, but lost to Los Angeles in 1985 and 1987.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2012 off-season started with the Celtics having only six players under contract. While Kevin Garnett was signed to a new contract, Ray Allen signed with the Miami Heat for less money than the Celtics offered; this move brought the five-year \"Big Three\" era to a somewhat acrimonious end. The Celtics finished the season with 41 wins.[119] The Celtics trailed the New York Knicks 3\u20130 in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs before losing the series in six games. In Game Six, the Celtics nearly completed a comeback when they went on a 20\u20130 run to cut the lead to four.[120]\n\n\n\n### 2013\u20132016: post-Pierce era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, with the return of Garnett from injury and the additions of Rasheed Wallace and Marquis Daniels, the Celtics started the season 23\u20135 and at one point had the best record in the NBA. However, Doc Rivers decided to lessen his aging stars' minutes to keep them fresh for the playoffs. As a result, the Celtics sputtered to an even 27\u201327 record the rest of the way and finished the 2009\u201310 regular season with a 50\u201332 record.[112] Despite being the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, the Celtics managed to make the NBA Finals. Rajon Rondo emerged as a star during postseason play.[113] For the 12th time, the Celtics faced the Lakers in the Finals. After taking a 3\u20132 lead heading into Los Angeles for Game Six, the Celtics appeared poised to win their 18th title. However, starting center Kendrick Perkins suffered a severe knee injury early in Game Six,[114] and the Celtics went on to lose the series in seven games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Celtics\u2013Hawks rivalry is a rivalry in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association that has lasted for over five decades, although the two teams have played each other since the 1949\u201350 season, when the then-Tri-Cities Blackhawks joined the NBA as part of the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America merger. However, the Blackhawks could not field a truly competitive team until they moved to St. Louis as the St. Louis Hawks after a four-year stopover at Milwaukee. The two teams have faced each other eleven times in the NBA Playoffs, four times in the NBA Finals, with the Celtics winning ten of twelve series against the Hawks, including three out of four NBA Finals.[172] While the Hawks have only defeated the Celtics twice out of eleven series in the NBA Playoffs, they still often managed to make their series with the Celtics memorable. The rivalry intensified in 2016 with Hawks All-Star Center Al Horford spurning the team and joining the Celtics.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the summer of 2007, general manager Danny Ainge made a series of moves that returned the Celtics to prominence. On draft night, he traded No. 5 pick Jeff Green, Wally Szczerbiak and Delonte West to Seattle for perennial All-Star Ray Allen and Seattle's second-round pick, which the team used to select LSU's Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis.[104] The Celtics then traded Ryan Gomes, Gerald Green, Al Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Sebastian Telfair, and a first-round draft pick to the Timberwolves in exchange for superstar power forward Kevin Garnett.[105] These moves created a new \"Big Three\" of Pierce, Allen, and Garnett.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nKevin Garnett and Ray Allen were key players in the Celtics' 2008 NBA title victory\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNational Basketball Association team in Boston, Massachusetts\n\n\"Celtics\" redirects here.

Garnett was eventually shelved for the playoffs. The 2009 Celtics still finished with 62 victories, but their playoff run would end against the Magic in the second round.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a deal with the Portland Trail Blazers, the Celtics sent former 6th man of the year Malcom Brogdon, Robert Williams III, the Warriors 2024 First round pick, and an unprotected 2029 first round pick in exchange for Jrue Holliday on October 1.\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry\n\nThe rivalry between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers involves the two most storied franchises in NBA history. It has been called the NBA's best rivalry.[171] The two teams have met a record twelve times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s, three times in the 1980s, in 2008, and in 2010.\n\n\nThe Celtics have won the first eight finals meetings, while the Lakers won three of last four.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder Ford's leadership, the Celtics improved to 56\u201326 in 1990\u201391, recapturing the Atlantic Division title even though Bird missed 22 games with several injuries. The Celtics again lost to the Pistons in the playoffs. In 1992, a late-season rally allowed a 51\u201331 Celtics team to catch the New York Knicks and repeat as Atlantic Division champions. After sweeping the Indiana Pacers in the first round, the Celtics lost a seven-game Eastern Conference Semifinals series to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Back injuries limited Bird to only 45 regular-season games, and just four of ten in the playoffs. After thirteen NBA seasons and a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics with the Dream Team, continued back trouble led Bird to retire in 1992.\n\n\n\n### 1993\u20131998: tragedy and decline[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 2015 NBA draft Boston selected Terry Rozier, R.J. Hunter, Jordan Mickey, and Marcus Thornton with the 16th, 28th, 33rd, and 45th selections respectively. During the off-season, the Celtics signed forward Amir Johnson and traded Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb in exchange for Warriors forward David Lee. The Celtics finished the 2015\u201316 NBA season with a 48\u201334 record, earning the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. They played the fourth seed Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs. After leading by 3 points in the fourth quarter of Game 1, guard Avery Bradley went down with a hamstring injury, making him sit out for the rest of the series. The Celtics lost the series 4\u20132 to the Hawks, ending their season.\n\n\n\n### 2016\u2013present: \"The Jays\": Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum era[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the NBA Europe Live Tour prior to the 2007\u201308 season, the Celtics used the alternate road jerseys in their game against the Toronto Raptors in Rome, except that the words \"Boston\" on the front side of the jersey and the shamrock on the shorts and on the reverse side of the jersey contained the green, white and red tricolors of the Italian flag. In the second game in London, the regular road jerseys featured a patch containing the Union Jack.\n\n\nAt the 2008\u201309 season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Celtics wore a modified version of their home uniforms, accented with gold, to commemorate last season's championship team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, the rivalry between the Nets and the Celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets in exchange for Wallace, Humphries, and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two Atlantic Division teams.[176] Celtics announcer Sean Grande said \"It's almost as if you found a great home for these guys. You couldn't have found a better place. These guys will be in the New York market, they'll be on a competitive team, they'll stay on national TV. It's funny, because the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So with Celtics fans feeling the way they do about the Heat, feeling the way they do about the Knicks, the Nets are going to become almost the second [Boston] team now.\"[177] The trade would end up crippling the Nets who posted a record of 151\u2013259 following the trade including three consecutive seasons with fewer than 30 wins from 2016 to 2018. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt first, the Celtics received a much-needed boost from guard Tony Allen but he tore his ACL and MCL on a needless dunk attempt after the whistle.[102] The Celtics compiled a record of 24\u201358, second-worst in the NBA, including a franchise-record 18-game losing streak.[103] At the end of the season, the Celtics, with the second-worst record in the NBA, were at least hopeful that they could secure a high draft pick and select either Greg Oden or Kevin Durant to help rebuild the franchise, but the Celtics fell to fifth in the Draft Lottery.\n\n\n\n####  2007\u20132012: new \"Big Three\": Pierce, Allen, and Garnett era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter the departure of Parish as a free agent, the retirements of Bird and McHale, as well as the untimely deaths of 2nd overall draft pick Len Bias and star player Reggie Lewis, the team struggled through the 1990s and much of the early 2000s. It was not until the Celtics assembled a new \"Big Three\" of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen that they found success once again. Under the leadership of head coach Doc Rivers, the team beat the Lakers to win a championship in 2008, but lost to Los Angeles in a seven-game series in 2010, the latest Finals matchup between the two ancient rivals. By the start of the 2013\u201314 season, none of the new \"Big Three\" were still with the team. Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce were traded away to the Brooklyn Nets, while Allen left as a free agent. After a period of rebuilding, the Celtics became a force again under head coach Brad Stevens. During the 2016\u201317 season, the Celtics clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference, but were eliminated in the Conference Finals. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1983\u201384, the Celtics under new coach K. C. Jones would go 62\u201320 and return to the NBA Finals after a three-year hiatus.[66] Boston came back from a 2\u20131 deficit to defeat the Lakers for their 15th championship.[67] Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers star Magic Johnson during this series. After the season, Auerbach officially retired as general manager, but maintained the position of team president.[68] He was succeeded by Jan Volk.[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Celtics' rise to dominance began in the late 1950s, after the team, led by coach Red Auerbach, acquired center Bill Russell, who would become the cornerstone of the Celtics dynasty, in a draft-day trade in 1956. Led by Russell and point guard Bob Cousy, the Celtics won their first NBA championship in 1957. Russell, along with a talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers including John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, K. C. Jones, Sam Jones, Satch Sanders, and Bill Sharman, would usher the Celtics into the greatest period in franchise history, winning eight consecutive NBA championships from 1959 to 1966. After Russell retired in 1969, the team entered a period of rebuilding. In the mid-1970s, the Celtics became contenders once again, winning two championships in 1974 and 1976 under the leadership of center Dave Cowens, forward John Havlicek, and point guard Jo Jo White. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n119. **^** Ben Golliver. \"NBA cancels game between Celtics and Pacers after Boston Marathon blasts\". *SI.com*.

The injury of Brown was particularly impactful as he would miss the playoffs. Boston could not automatically qualify for the playoffs and were sent to the play-in tournament where they defeated the Washington Wizards 119\u2013100.

However, with the acquisition of Paul Silas and future Hall of Famers Dave Cowens[32] and Jo Jo White,[33] the Celtics soon became dominant again. After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1972, the Celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an excellent 68\u201314 regular-season record. But the season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in seven games by the New York Knicks in the Conference Finals. John Havlicek injured his right shoulder in game six and was forced to play game seven shooting left-handed.[34] The Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1974 NBA Finals for their 12th NBA championship.[35] Boston took a 3\u20132 series lead and had a chance to claim the title on their home court. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Head coach Doc Rivers led the Celtics to an NBA title in 2008.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n58. **^** \"Larry Bird Bio\". *NBA.com*.

The Celtics won Game One at home 98\u201388, fueled by strong play by Garnett and Pierce's dramatic comeback from a second-half knee injury. They won Game Two 108\u2013102 despite nearly blowing a 24-point lead in the fourth quarter. As the series shifted to Los Angeles, the Lakers stifled Pierce and Garnett in Game Three and won 87\u201381. However, the Celtics would overcome a 24-point deficit in Game 4 to win 97\u201391, making the largest in-game comeback in NBA Finals history. After again blowing a large lead, the Lakers hung on to win Game 5 103\u201398, sending the series back to Boston. In Game 6, the Celtics overpowered the Lakers, winning 131\u201392 and clinching their 17th NBA title. Paul Pierce was named Finals MVP.[107] With the win the Celtics set a record for most games a team had ever played in a postseason with 26.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in six games. The Finals featured one of the greatest games in NBA history. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed.[36] After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another rebuilding phase. In the 1977 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted a young forward from UNC Charlotte named Cedric Maxwell.[37] \"Cornbread\" Maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed promise. Auerbach's job became even tougher following the 1977\u201378 season in which they went 32\u201350 as Havlicek, the Celtics' all-time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C. | December 2002 \u2013 present*[94]* |\n\n\n\\**Sale not approved by NBA*[246]\n\n\n\n### Team presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| All-time Team presidents\n |\n| --- |\n| President\n | Tenure\n |\n| Walter A.

In 2012, the year the Nets returned to New York in the borough of Brooklyn, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on November 28, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo, Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined.[175] The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1988, the Celtics lost in six games to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals.[74] Following the season, head coach K.C.

Boston's hopes for 1988\u201389 faded when Bird underwent a procedure to remove bone spurs in his feet early in the season, and the Celtics won just 42 games before a first-round playoff defeat to the Pistons. Bird returned in 1989\u201390 and led the Celtics to a 52\u201330 record. In the playoffs, the Celtics collapsed after winning the first two games in a best-of-five series against the New York Knicks, losing three straight games and the series.

During the following off-season, the Celtics acquired Bill Walton from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Cedric Maxwell.[70] Walton had been an All-Star and league MVP while leading the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1977 NBA championship, but injuries had hobbled him since. Considered the best passing center in NBA history, he stayed healthy and was a big part of the Celtics' success in 1986.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAuerbach retired as coach after the 1965\u201366 season and Russell took over as player-coach, which was Auerbach's ploy to keep Russell interested.[28] With his appointment Russell became the first African-American coach in any U.S. pro sport. Auerbach would remain the general manager, a position he would hold well into the 1980s. However, the Celtics' string of NBA titles ended when they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1967 Eastern Conference Finals. The aging team managed two more championships in 1968 and 1969, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers each time.[29] Russell retired after the 1969 season, effectively ending a Celtics dynasty that had garnered an unrivaled 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons.[30] The team's run of 8 consecutive is the longest championship streak in U.S. professional sports history.[31]\n\n\n\n### 1970\u20131978: Cowens\u2013Havlicek\u2013White era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nJohn Havlicek, 16 years with the Celtics\n![](image)\nDave Cowens, two titles and MVP in 1973\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Most steals\n |\n| --- |\n| Player\n | Steals\n |\n| Paul Pierce | 1,583\n |\n| Larry Bird | 1,556\n |\n| *Rajon Rondo* | 990\n |\n| *Marcus Smart* | 914\n |\n| Robert Parish | 873\n |\n| Antoine Walker | 828\n |\n| Dee Brown | 675\n |\n| Danny Ainge | 671\n |\n| Dennis Johnson | 654\n |\n| Dave Cowens and Reggie Lewis | 569\n |\n| Most blocks\n |\n| --- |\n| Player\n | Blocks\n |\n| Robert Parish | 1,703\n |\n| Kevin McHale | 1,690\n |\n| Larry Bird | 755\n |\n| Paul Pierce | 668\n |\n| Kendrick Perkins | 646\n |\n| Dave Cowens | 473\n |\n| Reggie Lewis | 417\n |\n| **Al Horford** | 403\n |\n| Kevin Garnett | 394\n |\n| Cedric Maxwell | 378\n |\n| Most three-pointers made\n |\n| --- |\n| Player\n | 3-pointers made\n |\n| Paul Pierce | 1,823\n |\n| **Jayson Tatum** | 1,067\n |\n| Antoine Walker | 937\n |\n| *Marcus Smart* | 911\n |\n| **Jaylen Brown** | 883\n |\n| Ray Allen | 798\n |\n| Larry Bird | 649\n |\n| *Avery Bradley* | 520\n |\n| **Al Horford** | 490\n |\n| *Isaiah Thomas* | 460\n |\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n### Head coaches[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Celtics entered the 2001\u201302 season with low expectations.

The Celtics won a hard-fought 5-game series with the 76ers in the first round, 3\u20132. Pierce scored 46 points in the series-clinching game at the Fleet Center. In the Conference Semifinals, the Celtics defeated the favored Detroit Pistons 4\u20131.

Yet they seemed to have a core of good young players, led by Pierce and rookie Al Jefferson, to go along with a group of able veterans. The Celtics went 45\u201337 and won their first Atlantic Division title since 1991\u201392, receiving a boost from returning star Antoine Walker in mid-season. The Pacers defeated them in the first round yet again, with the series culminating in an embarrassing 27-point loss in Game 7 at the Fleet Center.

The 2014\u201315 season had several roster moves, the most prominent being Rondo and rookie Dwight Powell traded to the Dallas Mavericks for center Brandan Wright, forward Jae Crowder, veteran point guard Jameer Nelson, and future picks.[126] A total of 22 players spent time with the Celtics,[127] leading scorer and rebounder Sullinger suffered a season-ending left metatarsal stress fracture,[128] and the team was only tenth in the East with 28 games remaining.[129] However, midseason acquisition Isaiah Thomas helped the team win 22 of their last 34 games, finishing the season with a 40\u201342 record, enough for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.[130] The Celtics were swept by the second seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor much of their history, the Celtics wore green uniforms on the road and white uniforms at home. The basic template of the current Celtics' uniforms was formalized in the team's early years, and along the way they made a few adjustments in the lettering and stripes.[216]\n\n\nAmong the more notable changes in the uniforms were the switch from serifed to sans-serif block lettering in 1968, the addition of names in 1972, and the incorporation of the three-leaf shamrock logo in 1998. While the white uniforms remained largely intact, the green uniforms have featured either the city name (1950s\u20131965; 2014\u2013present) or the team name (1965\u20132014).[3]\n\n\nWhen Nike became the NBA's uniform provider in 2017, they decided to eliminate the \"home\" and \"away\" uniform designations. Thus the white Celtics uniforms became known as the \"Association\" uniforms while the green uniforms became the \"Icon\" uniforms. Both sets are now used regardless of home and road games.[217][218]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the playoffs, they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the First Round in seven games, and continued the feat in the Conference Semifinals by defeating the Philadelphia 76ers in five games before losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games in the Conference Finals.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the 2018\u201319 season, the Celtics wore white \"City\" uniforms with green letters and shamrocks trimmed in gold. It also has Red Auerbach's signature near the uniform tag and a gold-trimmed alternate Celtics logo on the beltline.[228][229] In addition, the Celtics wore an \"Earned\" edition uniform exclusive only to the 16 teams that made the 2018 NBA playoffs. Their rendition is a palette swap of the \"City\" uniforms with a green base and gold letters and shamrocks with white trim.[230]\n\n\nThe Celtics' \"City\" uniform for the 2019\u201320 season featured a green base and a stylized \"Boston\" wordmark and numbers in gold with black trim. A Celtic knot in the shape of a shamrock adorn the beltline.[231]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n141. **^** Rapaport, Daniel (October 17, 2017). \"Gordon Hayward Suffers Dislocated Ankle, Fractured Tibia in First Quarter of Season Opener\". *Sports Illustrated*.

The initial uniforms were worn from 2006 to 2013 and it strongly resembled their regular green uniforms save for gold and white trim and the city name in front.[225] For 2014 and 2015, the uniforms were sleeved, replaced the city name in front in favor of the team name, and now resembled their green/black alternates.[226] In 2016 and 2017, the uniforms were again sleeveless and featured the city name in front, but kept the previous striping.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Celtics have also worn special edition Christmas Day uniforms since the 2008\u201309 season. For the first four games, they wore their regular green uniforms modified with the NBA logo inside a snowflake. Then in the 2012\u201313 season, they wore monochrome uniforms with green lettering trimmed in white. For the 2016\u201317 season, the Celtics wore a special green uniform with a more ornate script lettering, but without the additional striping.\n\n\nStarting with the 2017\u201318 season, the Celtics wore special edition \"City\" uniforms designed by Nike. Their first \"City\" uniforms were in gray and featured a pattern of the parquet floor throughout, a green shamrock with white trim on the left leg, green letters with white trim, Red Auerbach's signature near the uniform tag, and a portion of the 2008 championship banner on the beltline.[227]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n223. **^** \"Boston Celtics and adidas Unveil Parquet Pride Collection\". *Celtics.com* (Press release).

The alternate logo is based on logos used by the Celtics before they used the Zang Auerbach leprechaun. For much of its history, the shamrock was trimmed in gold, as seen in the old team warmup jackets. A new secondary logo, unveiled in 2014, featured a variation of the leprechaun logo, in silhouette form.[214][215]\n\n\n\n### Uniforms[edit]\n\n\n#### Primary uniforms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe Celtics uniforms, as worn by Bill Sharman, Dennis Johnson, Rajon Rondo and Semi Ojeleye, have seen minimal changes since the 1950s.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Name | Position | Tenure\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Dave Gavitt | CEO | 1990\u20131994\n |\n| Larry Bird | Special assistant to front office | 1992\u20131997\n |\n| M.

The young team that lost 67 games the year before was dismantled, with David Wesley, Dino Ra\u0111a and Rick Fox being let go, and Williams traded to the Denver Nuggets for a pair of second round draft picks (Williams would return to the Celtics in 1999 and played for four years). Walter McCarty was also acquired in a trade with the Knicks. With a promising start, upsetting the defending champions Chicago Bulls at home on opening night,[83] and hard play from the youngsters that led to leaderships in turnovers and steals, the team improved its victories from 15 to 36 despite many losing streaks.[84][85] Billups was subsequently traded to the Raptors during his rookie year,[86] and Mercer was traded to the Nuggets during his third season.[87]\n\n\n\n### 1998\u20132013: Paul Pierce era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n202. **^** The Associated Press (November 28, 1996). \"Magic Edge Hawks\". *Gainesville Sun*.
