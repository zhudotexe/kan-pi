The source of the data is the U.S. Census Bureau and the data is current as of the indicated year. Independent cities are considered county-equivalent by the Census Bureau.\n\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nBefore the American Civil War, the wealthiest counties were primarily located in Louisiana and Mississippi, because of the high number of enslaved people, who were not included in the population.[1]\n\n\nLoudoun County, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., is the highest-income county by median household income. Another Washington, D.C. suburb, Arlington County, Virginia, ranked as the highest-income county by median family income as of 2013.[2]\n\n\n\n## Median household income[edit]\n\n\n### 2020 Census[edit]\n\n\nThe chart below depicts the 100 highest income counties in the United States by median household income according to the 2020 United States census.[3] Virginia has the most counties in the top 100 with 18. It is followed by California with 11; Maryland with 10; New Jersey with nine; New York and Texas with six each; Illinois with five; Colorado, Massachusetts, and Minnesota with four each; Ohio and Pennsylvania with three each; Georgia, Indiana, Utah, and Washington with two each; and Connecticut, Washington, D.C., Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Wisconsin with
