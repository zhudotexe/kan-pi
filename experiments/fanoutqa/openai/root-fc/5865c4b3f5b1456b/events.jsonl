The drama featured the members as themselves, as well as Kim Sae-ron, Seo Kang-joon, and the girl group Hello Venus.[8]\n\n\nAfter their web drama finished airing, the group started the \"Meet U\" project. As part of the project, Astro traveled through South Korea, covering songs in front of crowds and holding fan meetings. Along with the performances, a KakaoTalk Plus Friends account was set up. Fantagio stated that once the group had gathered 10,000 friends on the app, they would announce their official debut date.[9] The goal was met by December 2015.[10] Their debut showcase, held on January 28, 2016, was sold out in under a minute and far exceeded the original limit of 1,000 attendants.[11][12] There, they also announced their official fan club name, Aroha.\n\n\nThey also appeared in their own reality TV show titled *Astro OK! Ready*, which began airing on January 21, 2016, on MBC every1[13] and concluded on February 18, 2016.[14]\n\n\n\n### 2016: Debut with *Spring Up* and rising popularity[edit]\n\n\nOn February 23, 2016, Astro released their debut extended play *Spring Up* alongside its lead single \"Hide & Seek\".[15] For two days, starting on February 22, 2016, showcases and press conferences were held at Lotte Card Art Center[16] and Wapop Concert Hall[17] to commemorate the group's first release. Within a week of its release, *Spring Up* reached number six on the *Billboard* World Albums Chart in the United States,[18] as well as number four on the Gaon Album Chart.\n[19] On February 25, the group released the music video for \"Cat's Eye\" (장화 신은 고양이), containing clips from their web drama *To Be Continued*. On April 13, Astro was the only Korean act invited to the LeTV Entertainment Awards in China. Due to their popularity in China, Cha Eun-woo was also offered a role in a Chinese drama shortly after their debut.[20]\n\n\nTheir second extended play *Summer Vibes* was released on July 1.[21] The album peaked at number six on the *Billboard* World Albums Chart[22] and at number two on the Gaon Album Chart.[23] Furthermore, the music video for \"Breathless\" (숨가빠), featuring labelmate Choi Yoo-jung of Weki Meki, surpassed half a million views in just three days.[24] The same month, on July 31, Astro performed in front of more than 20,000 people at Staples Center in Los Angeles for KCON 2016.[25][26]\n\n\nJust five months after their debut, Astro held their first solo mini concert titled *Astro 2016 Mini Live – Thankx Aroha* from August 27 to 28 at the KEPCO Art Center in Seoul.[27][28] Additional showcases were held in Japan,[29] Indonesia,[30] and Thailand[31] throughout the months of October and November.\n\n\nThe group released their third extended play *Autumn Story* on November 10.[32] The music video to its lead single \"Confession\" (고백) featured Sei of Weki Meki.

We are discussing the possibility of an autopsy to determine the precise cause of death.\"[1][26][27] On April 20, Gangnam Police told CNN that \"no signs of foul play have been found related to this case.\"[28]\n\n\nAccording to an official statement released by Fantagio on April 21, Moonbin was to be buried on April 22, 2023. The funeral procession and the burial site was kept private per the request of his family.[29][30]\n\n\nA day before his death, it had been announced that Moonbin was set to perform at the Dream Concert in Busan with fellow Astro member Sanha as part of their duo, Moonbin & Sanha.[25] The organizers expressed their condolences on their social media accounts.[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Astro (South Korean band) § Discography\n\nSee also: Moonbin & Sanha § Discography\n\n\n\n| Title\n | Year\n | Peak chart positions\n | Album\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| KORDown.[33] |\n| As lead artist\n |\n| \"Let's Go Ride\"\n | 2022\n | 59\n | *Drive to the Starry Road* |\n| \"Desire\" (이끌려)\n | 2023\n | 15\n | *Incense* |\n| Collaborations\n |\n| \"Language Test\"  (with Weki Meki Ji Su-yeon) | 2018\n | —\n | *FM2018\\_12Hz* |\n\n\n### Songwriting credits[edit]\n\n\nAll credits are listed under the Korea Music Copyright Association unless otherwise stated.[34]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Artist\n | Album\n | Lyricist\n | Composer\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\n | \"You & Me (Thanks Aroha)\"\n | Astro | *Winter Dream* | ![Yes](image) | ![No](image) |\n| 2018\n | \"By Your Side\" (너의 뒤에서)\n | *Rise Up* | ![Yes](image) | ![No](image) |\n| \"Merry-Go-Round (Christmas Edition)\"\n | Non-album single\n | ![Yes](image) | ![No](image) |\n| 2019\n | \"Merry-Go-Round\"\n | *All Light* | ![Yes](image) | ![No](image) |\n| 2021\n | \"Footprint\" (발자국)\n | *Switch On* | ![Yes](image) | ![No](image) |\n| 2022\n | \"Candy Sugar Pop\"\n | *Drive to the Starry Road* | ![Yes](image) | ![No](image) |\n| 2023\n | \"Madness\"\n | Moonbin & Sanha | *Incense* | ![Yes](image) | ![No](image) |\n| \"Desire\" (이끌려)\n | Himself\n | ![Yes](image) | ![Yes](image) |\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Television series[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2009\n | *Boys Over Flowers* | So Yi-jung (young)\n |  | [35] |\n| 2019\n | *Moment of Eighteen* | Jung Oh-je\n |  | [36][37] |\n\n\n### Web series[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2015\n | *To be Continued* | Himself\n |  | [7] |\n| 2016\n | *My Romantic Some Recipe* |  | Cameo appearance; episode 6\n | [38] |\n| 2017\n | *Idol Fever* |  | Cameo appearance\n | [39] |\n| *Sweet Revenge* | Himself\n | Cameo appearance\n | [40] |\n| 2019\n | *Soul Plate* | Angel Muriel\n |  | [41] |\n| 2020\n | *The Mermaid Prince* | Woo Hyuk\n | Lifetime Korea\n | [15] |\n| *The Mermaid Prince: The Beginning* | Choi Woo Hyuk\n | [16] |\n| 2021\n | *No Going Back Romance* |  | Cameo appearance\n | [42] |\n| *Find Me If You Can* |  | Cameo appearance; episode 6\n | [43] |\n\n\n### Television shows[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018–2019\n | *The Ultimate Watchlist of Latest Trend*  | Cast member\n | Season 1–2\n | [44][45] |\n| 2020\n | *Food Avengers* |  | [46] |\n| 2020–2022\n | *Show Champion* | Host\n | with Yoon San-ha and Kangmin | [47] |\n\n\n### Web shows[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021\n | *Insa Oppa* | Cast\n |  | [48] |\n| 2021–2022\n | *Saturday Night Live Korea* | Cast member\n | Season 2\n | [22] |\n| 2022\n | *Challenge* | Host\n | TikTok Stage on Air; with Yoon San-ha | [49] |\n\n\n### Hosting[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018\n | Incheon K-Pop Concert\n | with Kim Do-yeon | [50] |\n| 2020\n | Gangnam Festival K-Pop Concert\n | with Tiffany | [51] |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Astro (South Korean band) § Awards and nominations\n\n\n\nName of the award ceremony, year presented, category, nominee of the award, and the result of the nomination\n| Award ceremony\n | Year\n | Category\n | Nominee / Work\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| APAN Music Awards | 2020\n | Entertainer of the Year – Male\n | Moonbin\n | Nominated\n | [52] |\n| Seoul Webfest Film Festival\n | 2022\n | Best Supporting Actor\n | *Find Me If You Can* | Nominated\n | [53][54] |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"[단독] 아이돌 그룹 아스트로 멤버 문빈 자택서 숨진채 발견\" [[Exclusive] Idol group Astro member Moonbin found dead at home]. *Yonhap News* (in Korean).
