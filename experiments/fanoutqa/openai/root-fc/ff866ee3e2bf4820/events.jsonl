Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Endowment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard University endowment\n\nHarvard has the largest university endowment in the world, valued at about $50.7 billion as of 2023.[3][4]\nDuring the recession of 2007–2009, it suffered significant losses that forced large budget cuts, in particular temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex.[61]\nThe endowment has since recovered.[62][63][64][65]\n\n\nAbout $2 billion of investment income is annually distributed to fund operations.[66]\nHarvard's ability to fund its degree and financial aid programs depends on the performance of its endowment; a poor performance in fiscal year 2016 forced a 4.4% cut in the number of graduate students funded by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.[67]\nEndowment income is critical, as only 22% of revenue is from students' tuition, fees, room, and board.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Divestment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Financial endowment § Criticism and reforms\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** \"SCImago Institutions Rankings – Higher Education – All Regions and Countries – 2019 – Overall Rank\". *www.scimagoir.com*.

Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B.

Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \"Master's Teas\", but do not contain programs of study or academic departments.

Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Campus safety[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nECAC Hockey\n |\n| --- |\n| Teams | * **Brown Bears**\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* **Clarkson Golden Knights**\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* **Colgate Raiders**\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* **Cornell Big Red**\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* **Dartmouth Big Green**\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* **Harvard Crimson**\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* **Princeton Tigers**\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* **Quinnipiac Bobcats**\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* **Rensselaer Engineers**\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* **St. Lawrence Saints**\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* **Union Garnet Chargers**\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* **Yale Bulldogs**\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n |\n| Venues | * Meehan Auditorium (Brown)\n* Cheel Arena (Clarkson)\n* Class of 1965 Arena (Colgate)\n* Lynah Rink (Cornell)\n* Thompson Arena (Dartmouth)\n* Bright Hockey Center (Harvard)\n* Hobey Baker Memorial Rink (Princeton)\n* People's United Center (Quinnipiac)\n* Houston Field House (Rensselaer)\n* Appleton Arena (St. Lawrence)\n* Achilles Rink (Union)\n* Ingalls Rink (Yale)\n* Herb Brooks Arena (Men's tournament)\n |\n| Men's awards | * All-ECAC Hockey Team\n* Player of the Year\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n148. **^** AJ Giannini.

Vassar, then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[48] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[49] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[50] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n206. **^** \"About UOFC\".

All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history.

Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \"Master's Teas\", but do not contain programs of study or academic departments.

Classes vary in their format, ranging from small seminars to medium-sized lecture courses to large lecture courses.[238] The latter two typically have precepts, which are extra weekly discussion sessions that are led by either the professor or a graduate student.[238][239] The average class meeting time is 3–4 hours a week, although this can vary depending on the course.[238] The student to faculty ratio is 5 to 1,[239] and a majority of classes have fewer than 20 students.[234] In the *Fiske Guide to Colleges*, academic culture is considered as \"tight-knit, extremely hardworking, highly cooperative, and supportive.\"[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n313. **^** Quiñones, Eric (September 20, 2007). \"Residential life remodeled: Princeton moves into new four-year college system\". *Princeton University*.

Established in 1754 as **King's College** on the grounds of Trinity Church in Manhattan, it is the oldest institution of higher education in New York and the fifth-oldest in the United States.\n\n\nColumbia was established as a colonial college by royal charter under George II of Great Britain. It was renamed Columbia College in 1784 following the American Revolution, and in 1787 was placed under a private board of trustees headed by former students Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. In 1896, the campus was moved to its current location in Morningside Heights and renamed Columbia University.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)College Walk\nThe majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in the Upper Manhattan neighborhood of Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts planning principles by the architects McKim, Mead & White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or 32 acres (13 ha), in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive tunnel system, more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.[94]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOther teaching hospitals affiliated with Columbia through the NewYork-Presbyterian network include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan, and the Payne Whitney Westchester, a psychiatric institute located in White Plains, New York.[115] On the northern tip of Manhattan island (in the neighborhood of Inwood), Columbia owns the 26-acre (11 ha) Baker Field, which includes the Lawrence A. Wien Stadium as well as facilities for field sports, outdoor track, and tennis. There is a third campus on the west bank of the Hudson River, the 157-acre (64 ha) Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory and Earth Institute in Palisades, New York. A fourth is the 60-acre (24 ha) Nevis Laboratories in Irvington, New York, for the study of particle and motion physics. A satellite site in Paris holds classes at Reid Hall.[12]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Centers andInstitutes | * Women\n* Radiological\n* Oral History\n* Computer Music\n* Earth\n* Global\n* Goddard Institute\n* Harriman\n* Social and Economic Research\n* Social Research (former)\n* Tele-Information\n* War and Peace Studies\n* Earth Observatory\n* Neurological\n* Nevis\n\t+ RARAF\n* Psychiatric\n* East Asian\n |\n| Libraries | * Law\n* Architectural and Fine Arts\n* Burke\n* Butler\n* East Asian\n* Gottesman\n* Jewish Theological Seminary\n* Rare Book and Manuscript\n |\n| Athletics | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Teams | * Columbia Lions\n* Football\n* Baseball\n* Men's basketball\n* Women's basketball\n* Men's soccer\n* Men's squash\n* Women's squash\n* Fencing\n |\n| Spirit | * Columbia blue\n* Columbia–Cornell football rivalry\n* Deans' Cup\n* Liberty Cup\n* Marching Band\n* \"Roar, Lion, Roar\"\n* Roar-ee the Lion\n |\n| Venues | * Campbell Sports Center\n* Commisso Soccer Stadium\n* Lawrence A.

The Baker Athletics Complex also includes facilities for baseball, softball, soccer, lacrosse, field hockey, tennis, track, and rowing, as well as the new Campbell Sports Center, which opened in January 2013. The basketball, fencing, swimming & diving, volleyball, and wrestling programs are based at the Dodge Physical Fitness Center on the main campus.[245]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nColumbia is organized into twenty schools, including four undergraduate schools and 16 graduate schools. The university's research efforts include the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and accelerator laboratories with Big Tech firms such as Amazon and IBM.[10][11] Columbia is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and was the first school in the United States to grant the MD degree.[12] The university also annually administers the Pulitzer Prize. Its endowment stands at $13.3 billion as of 2022[update], which is among the largest of any academic institution.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn April 2007, the university purchased more than two-thirds of a 17 acres (6.9 ha) site for a new campus in Manhattanville, an industrial neighborhood to the north of the Morningside Heights campus. Stretching from 125th Street to 133rd Street, Columbia Manhattanville houses buildings for Columbia's Business School, School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia School of the Arts, and the Jerome L. Greene Center for Mind, Brain, and Behavior, where research will occur on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.[108][109] The $7 billion expansion plan included demolishing all buildings, except three that are historically significant (the Studebaker Building, Prentis Hall, and the Nash Building), eliminating the existing light industry and storage warehouses, and relocating tenants in 132 apartments. Replacing these buildings created 6.8 million square feet (630,000 m2) of space for the university. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** This figure does not include the Columbia University School of General Studies, which, though technically an undergraduate school of the university, is generally not counted as such when calculating undergraduate student body size and admission rates as it involves mainly non-traditional students. The office of Columbia Undergraduate Admissions only oversees students from Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.[6] Furthermore, the OPIR differentiates these undergraduate student bodies in separate Common Data Sets.[7]\n2. **^** Founding Fathers include five alumni: Alexander Hamilton,[19] John Jay,[20] Robert R. Livingston,[21] Egbert Benson,[22] and Gouverneur Morris.[23] Additionally, Founding Fathers George Clinton[24] and William Samuel Johnson[25] served as presidents of the university.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n118. **^** \"Columbia Greenmarket\".

For much of the 19th century, the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[92] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.[93]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n### Morningside Heights[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Access to Columbia is enhanced by the 116th Street–Columbia University subway station (1 train) on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.\nAccording to the A.

The plan commits to incorporating smart growth, new urbanism and \"green\" building design principles.[116] Columbia is one of the 2030 Challenge Partners, a group of nine universities in the city of New York that have pledged to reduce their greenhouse emissions by 30% within the next ten years.

The term refers to the long series of granite steps leading from the lower part of campus (South Field) to its upper terrace. With a design inspired by the City Beautiful movement, the steps of Low Library provides Columbia University and Barnard College students, faculty, and staff with a comfortable outdoor platform and space for informal gatherings, events, and ceremonies. McKim's classical facade epitomizes late 19th-century new-classical designs, with its columns and portico marking the entrance to an important structure.[107]\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the Morningside Heights campus as seen from Butler Library and facing Low Memorial Library\n\n### Other campuses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 14, 2010, Mayor Michael R.

Established in 1754 as **King's College** on the grounds of Trinity Church in Manhattan, it is the oldest institution of higher education in New York and the fifth-oldest in the United States.\n\n\nColumbia was established as a colonial college by royal charter under George II of Great Britain. It was renamed Columbia College in 1784 following the American Revolution, and in 1787 was placed under a private board of trustees headed by former students Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. In 1896, the campus was moved to its current location in Morningside Heights and renamed Columbia University.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)College Walk\nThe majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in the Upper Manhattan neighborhood of Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts planning principles by the architects McKim, Mead & White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or 32 acres (13 ha), in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive tunnel system, more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.[94]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOther teaching hospitals affiliated with Columbia through the NewYork-Presbyterian network include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan, and the Payne Whitney Westchester, a psychiatric institute located in White Plains, New York.[115] On the northern tip of Manhattan island (in the neighborhood of Inwood), Columbia owns the 26-acre (11 ha) Baker Field, which includes the Lawrence A. Wien Stadium as well as facilities for field sports, outdoor track, and tennis. There is a third campus on the west bank of the Hudson River, the 157-acre (64 ha) Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory and Earth Institute in Palisades, New York.

The university's research efforts include the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and accelerator laboratories with Big Tech firms such as Amazon and IBM.[10][11] Columbia is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and was the first school in the United States to grant the MD degree.[12] The university also annually administers the Pulitzer Prize. Its endowment stands at $13.3 billion as of 2022[update], which is among the largest of any academic institution.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn April 2007, the university purchased more than two-thirds of a 17 acres (6.9 ha) site for a new campus in Manhattanville, an industrial neighborhood to the north of the Morningside Heights campus. Stretching from 125th Street to 133rd Street, Columbia Manhattanville houses buildings for Columbia's Business School, School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia School of the Arts, and the Jerome L. Greene Center for Mind, Brain, and Behavior, where research will occur on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.[108][109] The $7 billion expansion plan included demolishing all buildings, except three that are historically significant (the Studebaker Building, Prentis Hall, and the Nash Building), eliminating the existing light industry and storage warehouses, and relocating tenants in 132 apartments. Replacing these buildings created 6.8 million square feet (630,000 m2) of space for the university. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** This figure does not include the Columbia University School of General Studies, which, though technically an undergraduate school of the university, is generally not counted as such when calculating undergraduate student body size and admission rates as it involves mainly non-traditional students.

For much of the 19th century, the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[92] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.[93]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n### Morningside Heights[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Access to Columbia is enhanced by the 116th Street–Columbia University subway station (1 train) on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.\nAccording to the A.

A large number of students migrating to universities under the G.I. Bill, and the ensuing increase in Penn's student population highlighted that Penn had outgrown previous expansions, which ended during the Great Depression era. But in addition to a significant student population from the Delaware Valley, the university continued to attract international students from at least 50 countries and from all 50 states as early as of the second decade of the 1920s.[84][87] Penn Trustee Paul Miller wrote that, in the post-World War II era,: \"[t]he bricks-and-mortar Capital Campaign of the Sixties...built the facilities that turned Penn from a commuter school to a residential one....\"[88] By 1961, 79% of male undergraduates and 57% of female undergraduates lived on campus.[89]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPenn's men's rugby team plays in the Ivy Rugby Conference[452] and have finished as runners-up in both 15s and 7s in the Conference and won the Ivy Rugby Tournament in 1992.[453] As of 2011[update], the club uses the state-of-the-art facilities at Penn Park. The Penn Quakers' rugby team played on national TV at the 2013 Collegiate Rugby Championship, a college rugby tournament that for number of years had been played each June at PPL Park (now known as Subaru Park) in Philadelphia and was broadcast live on NBC. In their inaugural year of participation, the Penn men's rugby team won the Shield Competition, beating local Big Five rival, Temple University, 17–12 in the final. In the semifinal match of that Shield Competition, Penn Rugby became the first Philadelphia team to beat a non-Philadelphia team in CRC history, with a 14–12 win over the University of Texas.[454]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPenn is also a top feeder school for careers in finance and investment banking on Wall Street[511] and its alumni have a strong presence in financial and economic life.

Since 1895, Franklin Field has hosted the annual collegiate track and field event \"the Penn Relays\", which is the oldest and largest track and field competition in the United States.[492]\n\n\nPenn's home court, the Palestra, is an arena used for men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball teams, wrestling team, and Philadelphia Big Five basketball, and other high school sporting events. The Palestra has hosted more NCAA Tournament basketball games than any other facility. Penn staff and students make use of the Palestra to play and/or watch basketball, volleyball, and fencing.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^**  Penn is the fourth-oldest using the founding dates claimed by each institution. The College of Philadelphia, which became Penn, College of New Jersey, which became Princeton University, and King's College, which later became Columbia College and ultimately Columbia University, all originated within a few years of each other. After initially designating 1750 as its founding date, Penn later considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century with Penn alumni observing a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1895, several elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the Intercollegiate Commission at the invitation of John J. McCook, a Union Army officer during the American Civil War and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress. The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **University of Pennsylvania** (often abbreviated simply as **Penn**[12] or **UPenn**[13]) is a private Ivy League research university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university's founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEven after its construction, however, many students sought living quarters elsewhere, where they would have more personal freedom, resulting in a loss of funds to the university. In the fall of 1775, Penn's trustees voted to advertise to lease the dormitory to a private family who would board the pupils at lesser cost to Penn.[70] In another attempt to control the off-campus activities of the students, the trustees agreed not to admit any out-of-town student unless he was lodged in a place which they and the faculty considered proper.[65] As of 1779, Penn, through its trustees, owned three houses on Fourth Street, just north of the campus's new building with the largest residence located on the corner of Fourth and Arch Streets.[71][65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, Princeton has not asserted this, and a Princeton historian says that \"the facts do not warrant\" such an interpretation.[40] Columbia also implicitly challenges Penn's use of either 1750, 1749 or 1740 as its founding date since it claims to be the fifth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States after Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and Princeton based on its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755.[41] Academic histories of American higher education typically list Penn variously as either the nation's fifth or sixth-oldest institution of higher learning in the nation after Princeton and immediately before or after Columbia.[42][43][44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nnear Independence Hall and Washington Square; (8) humanities and social sciences library (including Weigle Information Commons) located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street in the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (9) Lea library collection of Roman Catholic Church history, located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street, on the 6th floor of Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (10) Lippincott business library, located on campus, between 35th and 36th streets on Locust Street, in the second floor of the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (11) Math/Physics/Astronomy library, located on campus, on 3200 block of Walnut Streets, adjacent to The Palestra on the third floor of David Rittenhouse Laboratory; (12) archaeology and anthropology library within Penn Museum; (13) Rare Books and Manuscripts library (including the Yarnall Library of Theology) located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n541. **^** Slatin, Peter (May 9, 1993). \"Penn's Racing to Join Clubhouse Row\". *The New York Times*.

Starting in 1875 and through 1880, Penn fielded a varsity eleven, which played a few matches each year against opponents that included Haverford College and Columbia College.[412]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n(B) Judaism:\nOrganized Jewish life did not begin on campus in earnest until the start of 20th century.[374] Jewish Life on campus is centered at Penn branch of Hillel International,[375][311] which inspires students to explore Judaism, creates patterns of Jewish living that can be sustained after graduation, provides religious communities, promotes educational initiatives, social justice projects, social and cultural opportunities, and groups focusing on Israel education and politics, and hosts a Kosher Penn approved dining hall (supervised by the Community Kashrus of Greater Philadelphia).[376] In addition to Hillel, the other major Jewish organization with significant impact on Penn's campus is The Chabad Lubavitch House at Penn (founded in 1980[377]), which, among other activities, brings together Jewish college students with noted Jewish academics for in-depth discussions and debate.[378]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n443. **^** \"Penn's Olympic Competitors • University Archives and Records Center\". *University Archives and Records Center*.\n444. **^** as reported in *Evolvements of Early American Foot Ball: (see EASTERN USA RUGBY UNION TEAMS 1929/30-1950/51)* by Melvin I.

Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) Final Four appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to Magic Johnson-led Michigan State in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn's team is also a member of the Philadelphia Big 5, along with La Salle, Saint Joseph's, Temple, Villanova, and Drexel. In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Texas A&M.

In recent decades, they often have been league champions in football (14 times from 1982 to 2010) and basketball (22 times from 1970 to 2006). The first athletic team at Penn was the cricket team, which formed in 1842 and played regularly through 1846, the year it lost its \"grounds\", and then only played intermittently until 1864, the year it played its first intercollegiate game (against Haverford College).[403] The rowing (or crew) team composed of Penn students but not officially representing Penn was formed in 1854 but did not compete against other colleges as official part of Penn until 1879. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: University of Pennsylvania College Houses\n\nEvery College House at the University of Pennsylvania has at least four members of faculty in the roles of House Dean, Faculty Master, and College House Fellows.[148] Within the College Houses, Penn has nearly 40 themed residential programs for students with shared interests such as world cinema or science and technology.

But in addition to a significant student population from the Delaware Valley, the university continued to attract international students from at least 50 countries and from all 50 states as early as of the second decade of the 1920s.[84][87] Penn Trustee Paul Miller wrote that, in the post-World War II era,: \"[t]he bricks-and-mortar Capital Campaign of the Sixties...built the facilities that turned Penn from a commuter school to a residential one....\"[88] By 1961, 79% of male undergraduates and 57% of female undergraduates lived on campus.[89]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPenn's men's rugby team plays in the Ivy Rugby Conference[452] and have finished as runners-up in both 15s and 7s in the Conference and won the Ivy Rugby Tournament in 1992.[453] As of 2011[update], the club uses the state-of-the-art facilities at Penn Park.

The College of Philadelphia, which became Penn, College of New Jersey, which became Princeton University, and King's College, which later became Columbia College and ultimately Columbia University, all originated within a few years of each other. After initially designating 1750 as its founding date, Penn later considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century with Penn alumni observing a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1895, several elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the Intercollegiate Commission at the invitation of John J. McCook, a Union Army officer during the American Civil War and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress. The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **University of Pennsylvania** (often abbreviated simply as **Penn**[12] or **UPenn**[13]) is a private Ivy League research university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university's founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEven after its construction, however, many students sought living quarters elsewhere, where they would have more personal freedom, resulting in a loss of funds to the university. In the fall of 1775, Penn's trustees voted to advertise to lease the dormitory to a private family who would board the pupils at lesser cost to Penn.[70] In another attempt to control the off-campus activities of the students, the trustees agreed not to admit any out-of-town student unless he was lodged in a place which they and the faculty considered proper.[65] As of 1779, Penn, through its trustees, owned three houses on Fourth Street, just north of the campus's new building with the largest residence located on the corner of Fourth and Arch Streets.[71][65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, Princeton has not asserted this, and a Princeton historian says that \"the facts do not warrant\" such an interpretation.[40] Columbia also implicitly challenges Penn's use of either 1750, 1749 or 1740 as its founding date since it claims to be the fifth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States after Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and Princeton based on its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755.[41] Academic histories of American higher education typically list Penn variously as either the nation's fifth or sixth-oldest institution of higher learning in the nation after Princeton and immediately before or after Columbia.[42][43][44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nnear Independence Hall and Washington Square; (8) humanities and social sciences library (including Weigle Information Commons) located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street in the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (9) Lea library collection of Roman Catholic Church history, located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street, on the 6th floor of Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (10) Lippincott business library, located on campus, between 35th and 36th streets on Locust Street, in the second floor of the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (11) Math/Physics/Astronomy library, located on campus, on 3200 block of Walnut Streets, adjacent to The Palestra on the third floor of David Rittenhouse Laboratory; (12) archaeology and anthropology library within Penn Museum; (13) Rare Books and Manuscripts library (including the Yarnall Library of Theology) located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n541. **^** Slatin, Peter (May 9, 1993). \"Penn's Racing to Join Clubhouse Row\". *The New York Times*.

Emerging into national prominence at the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth was considered to be the most prestigious undergraduate college in the United States in the early 1900s.[8][9] While Dartmouth is now a research university rather than simply an undergraduate college, it continues to go by \"Dartmouth College\" to emphasize its focus on undergraduate education.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, Dartmouth College was the third highest in the nation in \"total of reports of rape\" on their main campus, with 42 reports of rape.[170] The *Washington Post* attributed the high number of rape reports to the fact that a growing number of sexual assault victims feel comfortable enough to report sexual assaults that would have gone unreported in previous years.[170] In 2015, the Huffington Post reported that Dartmouth had the highest rate of bystander intervention of any college surveyed, with 57.7% of Dartmouth students reporting that they would take some sort of action if they saw someone acting in a \"sexually violent or harassing manner,\" compared to 45.5% of students nationally.[171]\n\n\nDartmouth fraternities have an extensive history of hazing and alcohol abuse, leading to police raids and accusations of sexual harassment.[172][173]\n\n\n\n### Student groups[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Dartmouth College student groups, Dartmouth College publications, and Dartmouth College Greek organizations\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** \"Dartmouth College: At a Glance\". *U.S. News & World Report*.

Its 269-acre (1.09 km2) campus is centered on a 5-acre (2 ha) \"Green\",[107] a former field of pine trees cleared in 1771.[108] Dartmouth is the largest private landowner of the town of Hanover,[109] and its total landholdings and facilities are worth an estimated $434 million.[110] In addition to its campus in Hanover, Dartmouth owns 4,500 acres (18 km2) of Mount Moosilauke in the White Mountains[111] and a 27,000-acre (110 km2) tract of land in northern New Hampshire known as the Second College Grant.[112]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing a liberal arts curriculum, Dartmouth provides undergraduate instruction in 40 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs, including 60 majors in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering, and enables students to design specialized concentrations or engage in dual degree programs.[10] In addition to the undergraduate faculty of arts and sciences, Dartmouth has four professional and graduate schools: the Geisel School of Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, the Tuck School of Business, and the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies.[11] The university also has affiliations with the Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center. Dartmouth is home to the Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences, the Hood Museum of Art, the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding, and the Hopkins Center for the Arts. With a student enrollment of about 6,700, Dartmouth is the smallest university in the Ivy League. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDartmouth's original sports field was the Green, where students played cricket and old division football during the 19th century.[108] Today, two of Dartmouth's athletic facilities are located in the southeast corner of campus.[142] The center of athletic life is the Alumni Gymnasium, which includes the Karl Michael Competition Pool and the Spaulding Pool, a fitness center, a weight room, and a 1/13th-mile (123 m) indoor track.[143] Attached to Alumni Gymnasium is the Berry Sports Center, which contains basketball and volleyball courts (Leede Arena), as well as the Kresge Fitness Center.[144] Behind the Alumni Gymnasium is Memorial Field, a 15,600-seat stadium overlooking Dartmouth's football field and track.[145] The nearby Thompson Arena, designed by Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi and constructed in 1975, houses Dartmouth's ice rink.[146] Also visible from Memorial Field is the 91,800-square-foot (8,530 m2) Nathaniel Leverone Fieldhouse, home to the indoor track. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n113. **^** \"Kemeny Hall and Haldeman Center\".

Most prominent among them is the Sphinx society, housed in a prominent Egyptian tomb-like building near the center of campus. The Sphinx has been the subject of numerous rumors as to its facilities, practices, and membership.[187]\n\n\nThe college has an additional classification of social/residential organizations known as undergraduate societies.[188]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dartmouth Big Green\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeginning in the fall term of 2016, Dartmouth placed all undergraduate students in one of six House communities, similar to residential colleges, including Allen House, East Wheelock House, North Park House, School House, South House, and West House, alongside independent Living Learning Communities.[151] Dartmouth used to have nine residential communities located throughout campus, instead of ungrouped dormitories or residential colleges.[152] The dormitories varied in design from modern to traditional Georgian styles, and room arrangements range from singles to quads and apartment suites.[152] Since 2006, the college has guaranteed housing for students during their freshman and sophomore years.[153] More than 3,000 students elect to live in housing provided by college.[152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)\nThe college also offers 26 club and intramural sports such as fencing, rugby, water polo, figure skating, boxing, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and cricket, leading to a 75% participation rate in athletics among the undergraduate student body.[53][193] The Dartmouth Fencing Team, despite being entirely self-coached, won the USACFC club national championship in 2014.[194] The Dartmouth Men's Rugby Team, founded in 1951, has been ranked among the best collegiate teams in that sport, winning for example the Ivy Rugby Conference every year between 2008 and 2020.[195] The figure skating team won the national championship five straight times from 2004 through 2008.[196] In addition to the academic requirements for graduation, Dartmouth requires every undergraduate to complete a 50-yard (46 m) swim and three terms of physical education.[197]\n\n\n\n### Native Americans at Dartmouth[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n128. **^** \"Dartmouth College: Services and Facilities\". *U.S. News & World Report*.

The Dartmouth Plan (or simply \"D-Plan\") is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman year and two terms of their senior year, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year.[97] However, students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during terms of their senior year or sophomore summer terms.[98] During all terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects.[97] The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2019, Dartmouth College was elected to the Association of American Universities (AAU).[49]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Dartmouth College returned the papers of Samson Occum (who helped Eleazar Wheelock secure the funds for Dartmouth College for what Occom believed would be a school for Native students in Connecticut) to the Mohegan Tribe.[50][51]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Dartmouth Hall was rededicated after a $42 million renovation.

The university's central campus sits on a 15-acre (6.1-hectare) block bounded by Waterman, Prospect, George, and Thayer Streets; newer buildings extend northward, eastward, and southward. Brown's core, historic campus, constructed primary between 1770 and 1926, is defined by three greens: the Front or Quiet Green, the Middle or College Green, and the Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle (historically known as Lincoln Field).[57][58] A brick and wrought-iron fence punctuated by decorative gates and arches traces the block's perimeter. This section of campus is primarily Georgian and Richardsonian Romanesque in its architectural character.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBrown University\n |\n| --- |\n| Schools | * College\n* Graduate School\n* Alpert Medical School\n* School of Engineering\n* School of Public Health\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Centers | * Annenberg Institute\n* Arts Institute\n* Carney Institute\n* ICERM\n* Joukowsky Institute\n* Pembroke Center\n* Political Theory Project\n* Watson Institute\n |\n| Athletics | * Ivy League\n* Brown Bears\n* Football\n* Baseball\n* Men's basketball\n* Women's basketball\n* Men's lacrosse\n* Men's soccer\n* Men's ice hockey\n* Women's ice hockey\n* Sailing\n* Gouse Field\n* Marvel Gymnasium\n* Meehan Auditorium\n* Murray Stadium\n* Pizzitola Sports Center\n* Stevenson Field\n |\n| Campus | * Buildings\n* Statues\n* Angell Street\n* Andrews House\n* Annmary Brown Memorial\n* Bell Gallery\n* Computing Laboratory\n* Corliss–Brackett House\n* Granoff Center\n* Haffenreffer Museum\n* Hay Library\n* Joseph Haile House\n* John Carter Brown Library\n* Ladd Observatory\n* Lindemann Performing Arts Center\n* Nightingale–Brown House\n* Jerimoth Hill\n* Rockefeller Library\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university is home to the oldest applied mathematics program in the United States, the oldest engineering program in the Ivy League, and the third-oldest medical program in New England.[a][8][9][10] It was one of the early doctoral-granting U.S. institutions in the late 19th century, adding masters and doctoral studies in 1887.[11] In 1969, it adopted its Open Curriculum after a period of student lobbying, which eliminated mandatory \"general education\" distribution requirements, made students \"the architects of their own syllabus\", and allowed them to take any course for a grade of satisfactory (Pass) or no-credit (Fail) which is unrecorded on external transcripts.[12][13] In 1971, Brown's coordinate women's institution, Pembroke College, was fully merged into the university.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown is the largest institutional landowner in Providence, with properties on College Hill and in the Jewelry District.[55] The university was built contemporaneously with the eighteenth and nineteenth-century precincts surrounding it, making Brown's campus tightly integrated into Providence's urban fabric. Among the noted architects who have shaped Brown's campus are McKim, Mead & White, Philip Johnson, Rafael Viñoly, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and Robert A. M. Stern.[56]\n\n\n\n### Main campus[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Brown announced it had sold 90 percent of its fossil fuel investments as part of a broader divestment from direct investments and managed funds that focus on fossil fuels.[81] In 2021, the university adopted the goal of reducing quantifiable campus emissions by 75 percent by 2025 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2040.[82] Brown is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions. [83]\n\n\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Brown would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (*104*) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (*25*).[84]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### The College[edit]\n\n\nMain article: College of Brown University\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Brown Bears has one of the largest university sports programs in the United States, sponsoring 32 varsity intercollegiate teams.[213] Brown's athletic program is one of the *U.S. News & World Report* top 20—the \"College Sports Honor Roll\"—based on breadth of the program and athletes' graduation rates. \n\nAthletic facilities\n![](image)\nBrown Stadium (opened 1925)\n![](image)\nNelson Fitness Center (opened 2012)\n![](image)\nMarston Boathouse, on the Seekonk River\n![](image)\nMeehan Auditorium (opened 1961)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo the south of the central campus are academic buildings and residential quadrangles, including Wriston, Keeney, and Gregorian quadrangles. Immediately to the east of the campus core sit Sciences Park and Brown's School of Engineering. North of the central campus are performing and visual arts facilities, life sciences labs, and the Pembroke Campus, which houses both dormitories and academic buildings. Facing the western edge of the central campus sit two of the Brown's seven libraries, the John Hay Library and the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library.\n\n\nThe university's campus is contiguous with that of the Rhode Island School of Design, which is located immediately to Brown's west, along the slope of College Hill.\n\n\n\n#### Van Wickle Gates[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Van Wickle Gates\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrown women's gymnastics won the Ivy League tournament in 2013 and 2014. The Brown women's sailing team has won 5 national championships, most recently in 2019[216] while the coed sailing team won 2 national championships in 1942 and 1948.[217] Both teams are consistency ranked in the top 10 in the nation.[218]\n\n\nThe first intercollegiate ice hockey game in America was played between Brown and Harvard on January 19, 1898.[219] The first university rowing regatta larger than a dual-meet was held between Brown, Harvard, and Yale at Lake Quinsigamond in Massachusetts on July 26, 1859.[220][11]\n\n\nBrown also supports competitive intercollegiate club sports, including ultimate frisbee. The men's ultimate team, Brownian Motion, has won three national championships, in 2000, 2005, and 2019.[221]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Brown University alumni\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEast Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, originally served as the campus of Bryant University. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to relocate to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown purchased their Providence campus for $5 million. The transaction expanded the Brown campus by 10 acres (40,000 m2) and 26 buildings. In 1971, Brown renamed the area East Campus.[74] Today, the area is largely used for dormitories.\n\n\nThayer Street runs through Brown's main campus. As a commercial corridor frequented by students, Thayer is comparable to Harvard Square or Berkeley's Telegraph Avenue. Wickenden Street, in the adjacent Fox Point neighborhood, is another commercial street similarly popular among students.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university comprises the College, the Graduate School, Alpert Medical School, the School of Engineering, the School of Public Health and the School of Professional Studies. Its international programs are organized through the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, and it is academically affiliated with the Marine Biological Laboratory and the Rhode Island School of Design; with the latter, it offers undergraduate and graduate dual degree programs.\n\n\nBrown's main campus is in the College Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island. The university is surrounded by a federally listed architectural district with a dense concentration of Colonial-era buildings. Benefit Street, which runs along the campus's western edge, has one of America's richest concentrations of 17th- and 18th-century architecture.[14][15] Brown's undergraduate admissions are among the most selective in the country, with an overall acceptance rate of 5% for the class of 2026.[16][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. **^** Rubinton, Noel (October 20, 2017). \"Where to See (Really See) the Art of Maya Lin\". *The New York Times*.

This relationship has since strengthened resulting in both institutions offering a dual degree program.[126] In this partnership, Brown provides its traditional coursework while IE provides most of the business-related subjects making a differentiated alternative program to other Ivy League's EMBAs.[127] The cohort typically consists of 25–30 EMBA candidates from some 20 countries.[128] Classes are held in Providence, Madrid, Cape Town and Online.\n\n\n\n![](image)Pembroke Hall (1897) houses the administrative offices of the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women.\n### The Pembroke Center[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1770, the college moved from Warren to Providence. To establish a campus, John and Moses Brown purchased a four-acre lot on the crest of College Hill on behalf of the school. The majority of the property fell within the bounds of the original home lot of Chad Brown, an ancestor of the Browns and one of the original proprietors of Providence Plantations.[34] After the college was relocated to the city, work began on constructing its first building.\n\n\nA building committee, organized by the corporation, developed plans for the college's first purpose-built edifice, finalizing a design on February 9, 1770. The subsequent structure, referred to as \"The College Edifice\" and later as University Hall, may have been modeled on Nassau Hall, built 14 years prior at the College of New Jersey. President Manning, an active member of the building process, was educated at Princeton and might have suggested that Brown's first building resemble that of his alma mater.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Brown family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** \"Brown launches two free online courses\".

The university's central campus sits on a 15-acre (6.1-hectare) block bounded by Waterman, Prospect, George, and Thayer Streets; newer buildings extend northward, eastward, and southward. Brown's core, historic campus, constructed primary between 1770 and 1926, is defined by three greens: the Front or Quiet Green, the Middle or College Green, and the Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle (historically known as Lincoln Field).[57][58] A brick and wrought-iron fence punctuated by decorative gates and arches traces the block's perimeter. This section of campus is primarily Georgian and Richardsonian Romanesque in its architectural character.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBrown University\n |\n| --- |\n| Schools | * College\n* Graduate School\n* Alpert Medical School\n* School of Engineering\n* School of Public Health\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Centers | * Annenberg Institute\n* Arts Institute\n* Carney Institute\n* ICERM\n* Joukowsky Institute\n* Pembroke Center\n* Political Theory Project\n* Watson Institute\n |\n| Athletics | * Ivy League\n* Brown Bears\n* Football\n* Baseball\n* Men's basketball\n* Women's basketball\n* Men's lacrosse\n* Men's soccer\n* Men's ice hockey\n* Women's ice hockey\n* Sailing\n* Gouse Field\n* Marvel Gymnasium\n* Meehan Auditorium\n* Murray Stadium\n* Pizzitola Sports Center\n* Stevenson Field\n |\n| Campus | * Buildings\n* Statues\n* Angell Street\n* Andrews House\n* Annmary Brown Memorial\n* Bell Gallery\n* Computing Laboratory\n* Corliss–Brackett House\n* Granoff Center\n* Haffenreffer Museum\n* Hay Library\n* Joseph Haile House\n* John Carter Brown Library\n* Ladd Observatory\n* Lindemann Performing Arts Center\n* Nightingale–Brown House\n* Jerimoth Hill\n* Rockefeller Library\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university is home to the oldest applied mathematics program in the United States, the oldest engineering program in the Ivy League, and the third-oldest medical program in New England.[a][8][9][10] It was one of the early doctoral-granting U.S. institutions in the late 19th century, adding masters and doctoral studies in 1887.[11] In 1969, it adopted its Open Curriculum after a period of student lobbying, which eliminated mandatory \"general education\" distribution requirements, made students \"the architects of their own syllabus\", and allowed them to take any course for a grade of satisfactory (Pass) or no-credit (Fail) which is unrecorded on external transcripts.[12][13] In 1971, Brown's coordinate women's institution, Pembroke College, was fully merged into the university.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown is the largest institutional landowner in Providence, with properties on College Hill and in the Jewelry District.[55] The university was built contemporaneously with the eighteenth and nineteenth-century precincts surrounding it, making Brown's campus tightly integrated into Providence's urban fabric. Among the noted architects who have shaped Brown's campus are McKim, Mead & White, Philip Johnson, Rafael Viñoly, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and Robert A. M. Stern.[56]\n\n\n\n### Main campus[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Brown announced it had sold 90 percent of its fossil fuel investments as part of a broader divestment from direct investments and managed funds that focus on fossil fuels.[81] In 2021, the university adopted the goal of reducing quantifiable campus emissions by 75 percent by 2025 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2040.[82] Brown is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions. [83]\n\n\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Brown would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (*104*) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (*25*).[84]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### The College[edit]\n\n\nMain article: College of Brown University\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Brown Bears has one of the largest university sports programs in the United States, sponsoring 32 varsity intercollegiate teams.[213] Brown's athletic program is one of the *U.S. News & World Report* top 20—the \"College Sports Honor Roll\"—based on breadth of the program and athletes' graduation rates. \n\nAthletic facilities\n![](image)\nBrown Stadium (opened 1925)\n![](image)\nNelson Fitness Center (opened 2012)\n![](image)\nMarston Boathouse, on the Seekonk River\n![](image)\nMeehan Auditorium (opened 1961)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo the south of the central campus are academic buildings and residential quadrangles, including Wriston, Keeney, and Gregorian quadrangles. Immediately to the east of the campus core sit Sciences Park and Brown's School of Engineering. North of the central campus are performing and visual arts facilities, life sciences labs, and the Pembroke Campus, which houses both dormitories and academic buildings. Facing the western edge of the central campus sit two of the Brown's seven libraries, the John Hay Library and the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library.\n\n\nThe university's campus is contiguous with that of the Rhode Island School of Design, which is located immediately to Brown's west, along the slope of College Hill.\n\n\n\n#### Van Wickle Gates[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Van Wickle Gates\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrown women's gymnastics won the Ivy League tournament in 2013 and 2014. The Brown women's sailing team has won 5 national championships, most recently in 2019[216] while the coed sailing team won 2 national championships in 1942 and 1948.[217] Both teams are consistency ranked in the top 10 in the nation.[218]\n\n\nThe first intercollegiate ice hockey game in America was played between Brown and Harvard on January 19, 1898.[219] The first university rowing regatta larger than a dual-meet was held between Brown, Harvard, and Yale at Lake Quinsigamond in Massachusetts on July 26, 1859.[220][11]\n\n\nBrown also supports competitive intercollegiate club sports, including ultimate frisbee. The men's ultimate team, Brownian Motion, has won three national championships, in 2000, 2005, and 2019.[221]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Brown University alumni\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEast Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, originally served as the campus of Bryant University. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to relocate to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown purchased their Providence campus for $5 million. The transaction expanded the Brown campus by 10 acres (40,000 m2) and 26 buildings. In 1971, Brown renamed the area East Campus.[74] Today, the area is largely used for dormitories.\n\n\nThayer Street runs through Brown's main campus. As a commercial corridor frequented by students, Thayer is comparable to Harvard Square or Berkeley's Telegraph Avenue. Wickenden Street, in the adjacent Fox Point neighborhood, is another commercial street similarly popular among students.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university comprises the College, the Graduate School, Alpert Medical School, the School of Engineering, the School of Public Health and the School of Professional Studies. Its international programs are organized through the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, and it is academically affiliated with the Marine Biological Laboratory and the Rhode Island School of Design; with the latter, it offers undergraduate and graduate dual degree programs.\n\n\nBrown's main campus is in the College Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island. The university is surrounded by a federally listed architectural district with a dense concentration of Colonial-era buildings. Benefit Street, which runs along the campus's western edge, has one of America's richest concentrations of 17th- and 18th-century architecture.[14][15] Brown's undergraduate admissions are among the most selective in the country, with an overall acceptance rate of 5% for the class of 2026.[16][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. **^** Rubinton, Noel (October 20, 2017). \"Where to See (Really See) the Art of Maya Lin\". *The New York Times*.

This relationship has since strengthened resulting in both institutions offering a dual degree program.[126] In this partnership, Brown provides its traditional coursework while IE provides most of the business-related subjects making a differentiated alternative program to other Ivy League's EMBAs.[127] The cohort typically consists of 25–30 EMBA candidates from some 20 countries.[128] Classes are held in Providence, Madrid, Cape Town and Online.\n\n\n\n![](image)Pembroke Hall (1897) houses the administrative offices of the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women.\n### The Pembroke Center[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1770, the college moved from Warren to Providence. To establish a campus, John and Moses Brown purchased a four-acre lot on the crest of College Hill on behalf of the school. The majority of the property fell within the bounds of the original home lot of Chad Brown, an ancestor of the Browns and one of the original proprietors of Providence Plantations.[34] After the college was relocated to the city, work began on constructing its first building.\n\n\nA building committee, organized by the corporation, developed plans for the college's first purpose-built edifice, finalizing a design on February 9, 1770. The subsequent structure, referred to as \"The College Edifice\" and later as University Hall, may have been modeled on Nassau Hall, built 14 years prior at the College of New Jersey. President Manning, an active member of the building process, was educated at Princeton and might have suggested that Brown's first building resemble that of his alma mater.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Brown family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** \"Brown launches two free online courses\".

The campus is dominated by brick architecture, largely of the Georgian and Victorian styles. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907), and Metcalf Hall (1919), while the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910).

The more ornate buildings generally predate World War II, while the student population doubled from 7,000 in 1950 to 15,000 by 1970, leading to modernist architectural styles becoming more prevalent.[39]\n\n\nSeveral university buildings are listed as historic landmarks,[40] highlighting the architectural and historical significance of the campus. Those listed on the National Register of Historic Places include the Andrew Dickson White House, Bailey Hall, Caldwell Hall, the Computing and Communications Center, Morrill Hall, Rice Hall, Fernow Hall, Wing Hall, Llenroc, and 13 South Avenue (Deke House).[41] Three other listed historic buildings—the original Roberts Hall, East Robert Hall, and Stone Hall—were demolished in the 1980s to make way for new development.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Central, North, and West campuses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n120. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"An Act to establish Cornell University, and to appropriate to it the income of the sale of public lands granted to this State by Act of Congress, July 2, 1862.\". *Report of the Commissioner of Education, with circulars and documents accompanying the same*.

The university was founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White. Since its founding, Cornell has been a co-educational, non-sectarian institution where admission has not been restricted by religion or race. The student body for the fall 2022 semester consisted of more than 15,000 undergraduate and 7,000 graduate students from all 50 American states and 130 countries.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Ithaca campus is located in the Finger Lakes region and has views of the city, Cayuga Lake, and the surrounding valleys. The campus is bordered by two gorges, Fall Creek Gorge and Cascadilla Gorge, which contribute to the university's natural landscape. Although these gorges are popular swimming spots during warmer months, their use is discouraged by the university and city code due to potential safety hazards.[49] Adjacent to the main campus, Cornell owns the 2,800-acre (1,100 ha) Cornell Botanic Gardens, featuring various plants, trees, and ponds. The gardens' trails allow visitors to explore the natural surroundings.[50]\n\n\n\n#### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Cornell Central Campus, Cornell North Campus, and Cornell West Campus\n\nCentral Campus is the heart of the university, housing the majority of academic and administrative facilities. The architectural styles on Central Campus range from ornate Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and Neoclassical buildings to more spare international, and modernist structures. Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park, proposed a \"grand terrace\" overlooking Cayuga Lake in one of the earliest plans for the campus.[43]\n\n\nNorth Campus features primarily residential buildings, with ten residence halls designed to accommodate first and second-year students, as well as transfer students in the Townhouse Community.,[44] The architectural styles of North Campus are more modern, reflecting the growth of the university and the need for additional housing during the mid-20th century.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCornell's football team had at least a share of the national championship four times before 1940[234][235] and has won the Ivy League championship three times, last in 1990.[236]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Cornell men's basketball team appeared for the first time in the NCAA tournament's East Regional semifinals, known as the \"Sweet 16\". It was the first Ivy League team to make the semifinals since 1979.[237]\n\n\n\n### Cornell Outdoor Education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The sarcophagus in Sage Chapel of Jennie McGraw, a Cornell benefactor.\nCornell University, under Section 9 of its original charter, ensures equal access to education by admitting students without distinction based on rank, class, occupation, or locality.[120] The charter also mandates free instruction for one student from each Assembly district in the state.[120]\n\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1980s, Cornell collaborated with other Ivy League institutions to establish a uniform financial aid system.[121] Although a 1989 consent decree ended this collaboration due to an antitrust investigation, all Ivy League schools still offer need-based financial aid without athletic scholarships.[122] In December 2010, Cornell pledged to match any grant component of financial aid offers from other Ivy League schools, MIT, Duke, or Stanford for accepted applicants considering these institutions.[123]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Cornell Big Red\n\n![](image)A 1908 print depicting a Cornell Big Red baseball player\nCornell has 35[231] varsity intercollegiate teams that have the nickname of the Big Red. An NCAA division I institution, Cornell is a member of the Ivy League and ECAC Hockey and competes in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), the largest athletic conference in North America.[232] (ECAC Hockey is no longer affiliated with the ECAC.) Cornell's varsity athletic teams consistently challenge for NCAA Division I titles in a number of sports, including men's wrestling, men's lacrosse, men's ice hockey, and rowing (the women's crew program is subject to the NCAA, while the men's rowing program is governed by its own administrative body, the Intercollegiate Rowing Association). Under the Ivy League athletic agreement, the university does not offer athletic scholarships for athletic recruiting.[233]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCornell University| ![](image) |\n| Latin: *Universitas Cornelliana* |\n| Type | Private[1] land-grant research university |\n| Established | April 27, 1865; 159 years ago (1865-04-27) |\n| Founder | * Ezra Cornell\n* Andrew Dickson White\n |\n| Accreditation | MSCHE |\n| Academic affiliations\n | * AAU\n* COFHE\n* NAICU\n* SUNY\n* URA\n* Sea-grant\n* Space-grant\n |\n| Endowment | $10.0 billion (2023)[2] |\n| Budget | $5.4 billion (2023)[3] |\n| President | Martha E.

These colleges operate independently of state funding and oversight, giving them greater autonomy in determining their academic programs, admissions, and advising. They also do not offer discounted tuition for New York residents.\n\n\nOf the 15,182 undergraduate students at Cornell, 4,602 (30.3%) are affiliated with the largest college by enrollment, Arts and Sciences, followed by 3,203 (21.1%) in Engineering and 3,101 (20.4%) in Agriculture and Life Sciences. The smallest of the seven undergraduate colleges is Architecture, Art, and Planning, with 503 (3.3%) students.[4] The only university-wide requirements for a baccalaureate degree are to pass a swimming test, take two physical education courses, and satisfy a writing requirement. \n\n\n\n### Fundraising and financial support[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther press outlets include *The Cornell Lunatic*, a campus humor magazine; the *Cornell Chronicle*, the university's newspaper of record; and *Kitsch Magazine*, a feature magazine published in cooperation with Ithaca College. *The Cornellian* is an independent student organization that organizes, arranges, produces, edits, and publishes the yearbook of the same name; it is composed of artistic photos of the campus, student life, and athletics, and the standard senior portraits. It carries the Silver Crown Award for Journalism and a Benjamin Franklin Award for Print Design – the only Ivy League Yearbook with such a distinction.[218] Cornellians are represented over the radio waves on WVBR-FM, an independent commercial FM radio station owned and operated by Cornell students. Other student groups also operate internet streaming audio sites.[219]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn an attempt to create a sense of community and an atmosphere of education outside the classroom and continue Andrew Dickson White's vision, a $250 million reconstruction of West Campus created residential colleges there for undergraduates.[222] The idea of building a house system can be attributed in part to the success of Risley Residential College, the oldest continually operating residential college at Cornell.[223] In 2018, Cornell announced its North Campus Residential Expansive project. By 2022, the university aims to add 2,000 beds on North Campus. Five new dorms and a dining hall will be created, three of which will be located in Appel Field and will be exclusive for freshmen. Sophomores will have two new dorms located in the current CC Parking Lot.[224]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Culture**: All Sports Competition\n* \"Give My Regards to Davy\"\n* Harvard Hockey Rivalry\n* Touchdown (mascot)\n |\n| Campus | * **Campuses**: Central\n* North\n* Tech\n* West\n\n\n* **Buildings**: Arboretum\n* Art Museum\n* Bailey Hall\n* Balch Hall\n* Barnes Hall\n* Botanic Gardens\n* Bradfield Hall\n* Brain Collection\n* Caldwell Hall\n* Center for Advanced Computing\n* Computing and Communications Center\n* Comstock Hall\n* Dairy\n* Deke\n* Fernow Hall\n* Fuertes Observatory\n* Libraries\n* Llenroc\n* Hartung–Boothroyd Observatory\n* McGraw Tower\n* Morrill Hall\n* Ornithology Lab\n* Press\n* Rice Hall\n* Risley Residential College\n* Sage Chapel\n* Sage Hall\n* Statue of Ezra Cornell\n* Synchrotron\n* Straight Hall\n* Telluride House\n* Thompson Institute\n* A.D.

Of these, Schuyler House, which was formerly a part of Sage Infirmary,[225] has a dorm layout. Maplewood Apartments, Hasbrouck Apartments, and Thurston Court Apartments are apartment-style, some even allowing for family living. Off campus, many single-family houses in the East Hill neighborhoods adjacent to the university have been converted to apartments. Private developers have also built several multi-story apartment complexes in the Collegetown neighborhood. Nine percent of undergraduate students reside in fraternity and sorority houses, although first semester freshmen are not permitted to join them.[226] Cornell's Greek system has 67 chapters and over 54 Greek residences that house approximately 1,500 students. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)One of several footbridges that span Cornell's gorges and ease commuting from housing to academic buildings on campus\nUniversity housing is broadly divided into three sections: North Campus, West Campus, and Collegetown. Cornell began experiments with co-ed dormitories in 1971 and continued the tradition of residential advisors (RAs) within the campus system. In 1991, new students could be found throughout West Campus, including at the historic Baker and Boldt Hall complexes; since a 1997 residential initiative, West Campus houses transfer and returning students, whereas North Campus is almost entirely populated by freshmen as well as sorority and fraternity houses.[220]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA graduate student group, At What Cost?, formed at Cornell in August 2002 to oppose a graduate student unionization drive run by an organization called CASE/UAW that was affiliated with the United Auto Workers. The unionization vote was held October 23–24, 2002, and the union was rejected. At What Cost? was considered instrumental in the unusually large 90% turnout for the vote and in the 2-to-1 defeat of the unionization proposal. There had been no prior instance in American graduate student unionization history where a unionization proposal was defeated by a vote.[32][33][34]\n\n\nCornell also opened a graduate campus and research center on Roosevelt Island, Manhattan, New York City.\n\n\nThe university offers over 4,000 courses as of 2023.[35]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** \"Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar\" (Press release).

Key projects include a gas-fired combined heat and power facility,[51] an on-campus hydroelectric plant,[52] and a lake source cooling system.[53] In 2007, Cornell established a Center for a Sustainable Future.[54] The university has committed to achieving net carbon neutrality by 2035[55] and, as of 2020, is powered by six solar farms providing a total of 28 megawatts of power.[56] Additionally, Cornell is developing an enhanced geothermal system, Earth Source Heating, to meet campus heating needs.[57]\n\n\n\n### New York City campuses[edit]\n\n\n#### Weill Cornell[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Weill Cornell Medicine\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCornell runs one of the largest collegiate outdoor education programs in the country, serving over 20,000 people every year. The program runs over 130 different courses including but not limited to: Backpacking and Camping, Mountain Biking, Bike Touring, Caving, Hiking, Rock and Ice Climbing, Wilderness First Aid, and tree climbing.[238] COE also oversees one of the largest student-run pre-freshman summer programs, known as Outdoor Odyssey.[239] Most classes are often entirely taught by paid student instructors and courses count toward Cornell's physical education graduation requirement.[240]\n\n\nOne notable facility at Cornell Outdoor Education is the Lindseth Climbing Wall. The wall was renovated in 2016, and now includes 8,000 square feet of climbing surface up from 4,800 square feet previously.[241] The new wall now offers a more modern environment with bouldering, top-rope, and lead climbing facilities appropriate for various skill levels.[242]\n\n\n\n### Cornelliana[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cornelliana\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAdmission to Cornell University is highly competitive. In spring of 2022 (Class of 2026), Cornell's undergraduate programs received 71,164 applications and admitted only 5,168 for a 7.2% acceptance rate.[116] For Fall 2019 enrolling freshmen, the middle 50% range of SAT scores were 680–760 for evidence-based reading and writing and 720–800 for mathematics.[117] The middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 32–35.[117]\n\n\nThe university continues to attract a diverse and inclusive student body. The proportion of admitted students who self-identify as underrepresented minorities increased to 34.2% from 33.7% in 2021, and 59.3% self-identify as students of color. That number has increased steadily over the past five years, enrollment officials said, from 52.5% in 2017 and 57.2% in 2020.\n\n\nOf those admitted, 1,163 will be first-generation college students, another increase over 2020's 844.[118] The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.[119]\n\n\n\n### Financial aid[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCornell University is a non-profit organization with a decentralized structure where colleges and schools exercise wide autonomy in defining academic programs, admissions, advising, and conferring degrees. The university comprises nine privately endowed colleges and four publicly supported statutory colleges, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs. Cornell operates eCornell for online professional development and certificate programs[89] and participates in New York's land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant programs.[90][91]\n\n\n\n### Governance and administration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university is also host to various student pranks. For example, on at least two different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7 m) tall McGraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27 kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery.[245] The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day.[246] The clock tower also plays music.\n\n\nThe school colors are carnelian (a shade of red) and white, a play on \"Cornellian\" and Andrew Dickson White. A bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot \"Touchdown\" in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games.[8] The university's alma mater is \"Far Above Cayuga's Waters\", and its fight song is \"Give My Regards to Davy\". People associated with the university are called \"Cornellians\".\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Cornell University Mission\". Cornell University.

The university was founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White. Since its founding, Cornell has been a co-educational, non-sectarian institution where admission has not been restricted by religion or race. The student body for the fall 2022 semester consisted of more than 15,000 undergraduate and 7,000 graduate students from all 50 American states and 130 countries.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Ithaca campus is located in the Finger Lakes region and has views of the city, Cayuga Lake, and the surrounding valleys. The campus is bordered by two gorges, Fall Creek Gorge and Cascadilla Gorge, which contribute to the university's natural landscape. Although these gorges are popular swimming spots during warmer months, their use is discouraged by the university and city code due to potential safety hazards.[49] Adjacent to the main campus, Cornell owns the 2,800-acre (1,100 ha) Cornell Botanic Gardens, featuring various plants, trees, and ponds. The gardens' trails allow visitors to explore the natural surroundings.[50]\n\n\n\n#### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Cornell Central Campus, Cornell North Campus, and Cornell West Campus\n\nCentral Campus is the heart of the university, housing the majority of academic and administrative facilities. The architectural styles on Central Campus range from ornate Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and Neoclassical buildings to more spare international, and modernist structures. Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park, proposed a \"grand terrace\" overlooking Cayuga Lake in one of the earliest plans for the campus.[43]\n\n\nNorth Campus features primarily residential buildings, with ten residence halls designed to accommodate first and second-year students, as well as transfer students in the Townhouse Community.,[44] The architectural styles of North Campus are more modern, reflecting the growth of the university and the need for additional housing during the mid-20th century.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCornell's football team had at least a share of the national championship four times before 1940[234][235] and has won the Ivy League championship three times, last in 1990.[236]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Cornell men's basketball team appeared for the first time in the NCAA tournament's East Regional semifinals, known as the \"Sweet 16\". It was the first Ivy League team to make the semifinals since 1979.[237]\n\n\n\n### Cornell Outdoor Education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The sarcophagus in Sage Chapel of Jennie McGraw, a Cornell benefactor.\nCornell University, under Section 9 of its original charter, ensures equal access to education by admitting students without distinction based on rank, class, occupation, or locality.[120] The charter also mandates free instruction for one student from each Assembly district in the state.[120]\n\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1980s, Cornell collaborated with other Ivy League institutions to establish a uniform financial aid system.[121] Although a 1989 consent decree ended this collaboration due to an antitrust investigation, all Ivy League schools still offer need-based financial aid without athletic scholarships.[122] In December 2010, Cornell pledged to match any grant component of financial aid offers from other Ivy League schools, MIT, Duke, or Stanford for accepted applicants considering these institutions.[123]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Cornell Big Red\n\n![](image)A 1908 print depicting a Cornell Big Red baseball player\nCornell has 35[231] varsity intercollegiate teams that have the nickname of the Big Red. An NCAA division I institution, Cornell is a member of the Ivy League and ECAC Hockey and competes in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), the largest athletic conference in North America.[232] (ECAC Hockey is no longer affiliated with the ECAC.) Cornell's varsity athletic teams consistently challenge for NCAA Division I titles in a number of sports, including men's wrestling, men's lacrosse, men's ice hockey, and rowing (the women's crew program is subject to the NCAA, while the men's rowing program is governed by its own administrative body, the Intercollegiate Rowing Association). Under the Ivy League athletic agreement, the university does not offer athletic scholarships for athletic recruiting.[233]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCornell University| ![](image) |\n| Latin: *Universitas Cornelliana* |\n| Type | Private[1] land-grant research university |\n| Established | April 27, 1865; 159 years ago (1865-04-27) |\n| Founder | * Ezra Cornell\n* Andrew Dickson White\n |\n| Accreditation | MSCHE |\n| Academic affiliations\n | * AAU\n* COFHE\n* NAICU\n* SUNY\n* URA\n* Sea-grant\n* Space-grant\n |\n| Endowment | $10.0 billion (2023)[2] |\n| Budget | $5.4 billion (2023)[3] |\n| President | Martha E.

These colleges operate independently of state funding and oversight, giving them greater autonomy in determining their academic programs, admissions, and advising. They also do not offer discounted tuition for New York residents.\n\n\nOf the 15,182 undergraduate students at Cornell, 4,602 (30.3%) are affiliated with the largest college by enrollment, Arts and Sciences, followed by 3,203 (21.1%) in Engineering and 3,101 (20.4%) in Agriculture and Life Sciences. The smallest of the seven undergraduate colleges is Architecture, Art, and Planning, with 503 (3.3%) students.[4] The only university-wide requirements for a baccalaureate degree are to pass a swimming test, take two physical education courses, and satisfy a writing requirement. \n\n\n\n### Fundraising and financial support[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther press outlets include *The Cornell Lunatic*, a campus humor magazine; the *Cornell Chronicle*, the university's newspaper of record; and *Kitsch Magazine*, a feature magazine published in cooperation with Ithaca College. *The Cornellian* is an independent student organization that organizes, arranges, produces, edits, and publishes the yearbook of the same name; it is composed of artistic photos of the campus, student life, and athletics, and the standard senior portraits. It carries the Silver Crown Award for Journalism and a Benjamin Franklin Award for Print Design – the only Ivy League Yearbook with such a distinction.[218] Cornellians are represented over the radio waves on WVBR-FM, an independent commercial FM radio station owned and operated by Cornell students. Other student groups also operate internet streaming audio sites.[219]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn an attempt to create a sense of community and an atmosphere of education outside the classroom and continue Andrew Dickson White's vision, a $250 million reconstruction of West Campus created residential colleges there for undergraduates.[222] The idea of building a house system can be attributed in part to the success of Risley Residential College, the oldest continually operating residential college at Cornell.[223] In 2018, Cornell announced its North Campus Residential Expansive project. By 2022, the university aims to add 2,000 beds on North Campus. Five new dorms and a dining hall will be created, three of which will be located in Appel Field and will be exclusive for freshmen. Sophomores will have two new dorms located in the current CC Parking Lot.[224]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Culture**: All Sports Competition\n* \"Give My Regards to Davy\"\n* Harvard Hockey Rivalry\n* Touchdown (mascot)\n |\n| Campus | * **Campuses**: Central\n* North\n* Tech\n* West\n\n\n* **Buildings**: Arboretum\n* Art Museum\n* Bailey Hall\n* Balch Hall\n* Barnes Hall\n* Botanic Gardens\n* Bradfield Hall\n* Brain Collection\n* Caldwell Hall\n* Center for Advanced Computing\n* Computing and Communications Center\n* Comstock Hall\n* Dairy\n* Deke\n* Fernow Hall\n* Fuertes Observatory\n* Libraries\n* Llenroc\n* Hartung–Boothroyd Observatory\n* McGraw Tower\n* Morrill Hall\n* Ornithology Lab\n* Press\n* Rice Hall\n* Risley Residential College\n* Sage Chapel\n* Sage Hall\n* Statue of Ezra Cornell\n* Synchrotron\n* Straight Hall\n* Telluride House\n* Thompson Institute\n* A.D.

Of these, Schuyler House, which was formerly a part of Sage Infirmary,[225] has a dorm layout. Maplewood Apartments, Hasbrouck Apartments, and Thurston Court Apartments are apartment-style, some even allowing for family living. Off campus, many single-family houses in the East Hill neighborhoods adjacent to the university have been converted to apartments. Private developers have also built several multi-story apartment complexes in the Collegetown neighborhood. Nine percent of undergraduate students reside in fraternity and sorority houses, although first semester freshmen are not permitted to join them.[226] Cornell's Greek system has 67 chapters and over 54 Greek residences that house approximately 1,500 students. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)One of several footbridges that span Cornell's gorges and ease commuting from housing to academic buildings on campus\nUniversity housing is broadly divided into three sections: North Campus, West Campus, and Collegetown. Cornell began experiments with co-ed dormitories in 1971 and continued the tradition of residential advisors (RAs) within the campus system. In 1991, new students could be found throughout West Campus, including at the historic Baker and Boldt Hall complexes; since a 1997 residential initiative, West Campus houses transfer and returning students, whereas North Campus is almost entirely populated by freshmen as well as sorority and fraternity houses.[220]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA graduate student group, At What Cost?, formed at Cornell in August 2002 to oppose a graduate student unionization drive run by an organization called CASE/UAW that was affiliated with the United Auto Workers.

At What Cost? was considered instrumental in the unusually large 90% turnout for the vote and in the 2-to-1 defeat of the unionization proposal. There had been no prior instance in American graduate student unionization history where a unionization proposal was defeated by a vote.[32][33][34]\n\n\nCornell also opened a graduate campus and research center on Roosevelt Island, Manhattan, New York City.\n\n\nThe university offers over 4,000 courses as of 2023.[35]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** \"Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar\" (Press release).

Key projects include a gas-fired combined heat and power facility,[51] an on-campus hydroelectric plant,[52] and a lake source cooling system.[53] In 2007, Cornell established a Center for a Sustainable Future.[54] The university has committed to achieving net carbon neutrality by 2035[55] and, as of 2020, is powered by six solar farms providing a total of 28 megawatts of power.[56] Additionally, Cornell is developing an enhanced geothermal system, Earth Source Heating, to meet campus heating needs.[57]\n\n\n\n### New York City campuses[edit]\n\n\n#### Weill Cornell[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Weill Cornell Medicine\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCornell runs one of the largest collegiate outdoor education programs in the country, serving over 20,000 people every year. The program runs over 130 different courses including but not limited to: Backpacking and Camping, Mountain Biking, Bike Touring, Caving, Hiking, Rock and Ice Climbing, Wilderness First Aid, and tree climbing.[238] COE also oversees one of the largest student-run pre-freshman summer programs, known as Outdoor Odyssey.[239] Most classes are often entirely taught by paid student instructors and courses count toward Cornell's physical education graduation requirement.[240]\n\n\nOne notable facility at Cornell Outdoor Education is the Lindseth Climbing Wall. The wall was renovated in 2016, and now includes 8,000 square feet of climbing surface up from 4,800 square feet previously.[241] The new wall now offers a more modern environment with bouldering, top-rope, and lead climbing facilities appropriate for various skill levels.[242]\n\n\n\n### Cornelliana[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cornelliana\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAdmission to Cornell University is highly competitive. In spring of 2022 (Class of 2026), Cornell's undergraduate programs received 71,164 applications and admitted only 5,168 for a 7.2% acceptance rate.[116] For Fall 2019 enrolling freshmen, the middle 50% range of SAT scores were 680–760 for evidence-based reading and writing and 720–800 for mathematics.[117] The middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 32–35.[117]\n\n\nThe university continues to attract a diverse and inclusive student body. The proportion of admitted students who self-identify as underrepresented minorities increased to 34.2% from 33.7% in 2021, and 59.3% self-identify as students of color. That number has increased steadily over the past five years, enrollment officials said, from 52.5% in 2017 and 57.2% in 2020.\n\n\nOf those admitted, 1,163 will be first-generation college students, another increase over 2020's 844.[118] The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.[119]\n\n\n\n### Financial aid[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCornell University is a non-profit organization with a decentralized structure where colleges and schools exercise wide autonomy in defining academic programs, admissions, advising, and conferring degrees. The university comprises nine privately endowed colleges and four publicly supported statutory colleges, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs. Cornell operates eCornell for online professional development and certificate programs[89] and participates in New York's land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant programs.[90][91]\n\n\n\n### Governance and administration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university is also host to various student pranks. For example, on at least two different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7 m) tall McGraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27 kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery.[245] The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day.[246] The clock tower also plays music.\n\n\nThe school colors are carnelian (a shade of red) and white, a play on \"Cornellian\" and Andrew Dickson White. A bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot \"Touchdown\" in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games.[8] The university's alma mater is \"Far Above Cayuga's Waters\", and its fight song is \"Give My Regards to Davy\". People associated with the university are called \"Cornellians\".\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Cornell University Mission\". Cornell University.
