premiers of the State Council of the People's Republic of China** are high-ranking officials under the premier and above the state councillors and ministers.[1] Generally, the title is held by multiple individuals at any given time, with each vice-premier holding a broad portfolio of responsibilities. The first vice-premier takes over duties of the premier at the time of the latter's incapacity. The incumbent vice premiers, in order of rank, are Ding Xuexiang, He Lifeng, Zhang Guoqing and Liu Guozhong.\n\n\nThe highest-ranked office holder is informally called the **Senior Vice Premier** or **First Vice Premier** (Chinese: 第一副总理) or **Executive Vice Premier** (Chinese: 常务副总理), a most prominent case being Deng Xiaoping in the mid-to-late 1970s.[2][3] In irregular instances, the position of a senior vice premier has been named either to indicate degree of power, nominal power, or when the premier is incapacitated and requires a full-time deputy to carry out his regular duties.\n\n\n\n\n## Selection[edit]\n\n\nOfficially, the vice premiers are appointed by the National People's Congress (NPC) upon the nomination of the premier.[4] The NPC also has the power to remove the vice premiers and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote.[4] In practice, the vice premiers are chosen within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership, including the Politburo Standing Committee.[5]\n\n\nThe length of the vice premier's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years, and the vice premiers are restricted to two consecutive terms.[4] Immediately after the election, the president signs the presidential order formalizing the appointment of the vice premiers. Since 2018, the vice premiers are required to collectively recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.[5]\n\n\n\n## Powers and authority[edit]\n\n\nVice premiers are the deputies to the premier, with each vice premier overseeing a certain area of administration.[6] Vice premiers are members of the executive meetings of the State Council, along with the premier, secretary-general and state councillors.[4] Additionally, all vice premiers have been members of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party in recent decades, with the executive vice premier being a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.[7]\n\n\n\n## Current vice premiers[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of vice premiers of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n\n| Vice Premiers of the People's Republic of China |\n| --- |\n| Portrait\n | Information\n | Posts\n |\n| ![Ding Xuexiang](image)Ding Xuexiang | Rank\n | 1st\n | Member of the Politburo Standing Committee (6th Ranked)\n\n\n---\n\n\nDevelopment and reform, education, science and technology, finance, ecology and environment, statistics, and intellectual property\n |\n| Name\n | Ding Xuexiang |\n| Constituency\n | Liaoning At-large\n |\n| Birthplace\n | Nantong, Jiangsu |\n| Took office\n | 12 March 2023\n |\n|  |\n| ![He Lifeng](image)He Lifeng | Rank\n | 2nd\n | Member of the Politburo\n\n\n---\n\n\nPublic finance, natural resource management, housing and urban development, transportation, commerce\n |\n| Name\n | He Lifeng |\n| Constituency\n | Inner Mongolia At-large\n |\n| Birthplace\n | Xingning, Guangdong |\n| Took office\n | 12 March 2023\n |\n|  |\n| ![Zhang Guoqing](image)Zhang Guoqing | Rank\n | 3rd\n | Member of the Politburo\n\n\n---\n\n\nIndustry and information technology, emergency management, and state-owned enterprises\n |\n| Name\n | Zhang Guoqing |\n| Constituency\n | Tibet At-large\n |\n| Birthplace\n | Luoshan County, Henan |\n| Took office\n | 12 March 2023\n |\n|  |\n| ![Liu Guozhong](image)Liu Guozhong | Rank\n | 4th\n | Member of the Politburo\n\n\n---\n\n\nAgriculture and rural affairs, health, poverty alleviation, and meteorology\n |\n| Name\n | Liu Guozhong |\n| Constituency\n | Henan At-large\n |\n| Birthplace\n | Wangkui County, Heilongjiang |\n| Took office\n | 12 March 2023\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Organic Law of the State Council of the People's Republic of China\". *National People's Congress*.

premiers of the State Council of the People's Republic of China** are high-ranking officials under the premier and above the state councillors and ministers.[1] Generally, the title is held by multiple individuals at any given time, with each vice-premier holding a broad portfolio of responsibilities. The first vice-premier takes over duties of the premier at the time of the latter's incapacity. The incumbent vice premiers, in order of rank, are Ding Xuexiang, He Lifeng, Zhang Guoqing and Liu Guozhong.\n\n\nThe highest-ranked office holder is informally called the **Senior Vice Premier** or **First Vice Premier** (Chinese: 第一副总理) or **Executive Vice Premier** (Chinese: 常务副总理), a most prominent case being Deng Xiaoping in the mid-to-late 1970s.[2][3] In irregular instances, the position of a senior vice premier has been named either to indicate degree of power, nominal power, or when the premier is incapacitated and requires a full-time deputy to carry out his regular duties.\n\n\n\n\n## Selection[edit]\n\n\nOfficially, the vice premiers are appointed by the National People's Congress (NPC) upon the nomination of the premier.[4] The NPC also has the power to remove the vice premiers and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote.[4] In practice, the vice premiers are chosen within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership, including the Politburo Standing Committee.[5]\n\n\nThe length of the vice premier's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years, and the vice premiers are restricted to two consecutive terms.[4] Immediately after the election, the president signs the presidential order formalizing the appointment of the vice premiers. Since 2018, the vice premiers are required to collectively recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.[5]\n\n\n\n## Powers and authority[edit]\n\n\nVice premiers are the deputies to the premier, with each vice premier overseeing a certain area of administration.[6] Vice premiers are members of the executive meetings of the State Council, along with the premier, secretary-general and state councillors.[4] Additionally, all vice premiers have been members of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party in recent decades, with the executive vice premier being a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.[7]\n\n\n\n## Current vice premiers[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of vice premiers of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n\n| Vice Premiers of the People's Republic of China |\n| --- |\n| Portrait\n | Information\n | Posts\n |\n| ![Ding Xuexiang](image)Ding Xuexiang | Rank\n | 1st\n | Member of the Politburo Standing Committee (6th Ranked)\n\n\n---\n\n\nDevelopment and reform, education, science and technology, finance, ecology and environment, statistics, and intellectual property\n |\n| Name\n | Ding Xuexiang |\n| Constituency\n | Liaoning At-large\n |\n| Birthplace\n | Nantong, Jiangsu |\n| Took office\n | 12 March 2023\n |\n|  |\n| ![He Lifeng](image)He Lifeng | Rank\n | 2nd\n | Member of the Politburo\n\n\n---\n\n\nPublic finance, natural resource management, housing and urban development, transportation, commerce\n |\n| Name\n | He Lifeng |\n| Constituency\n | Inner Mongolia At-large\n |\n| Birthplace\n | Xingning, Guangdong |\n| Took office\n | 12 March 2023\n |\n|  |\n| ![Zhang Guoqing](image)Zhang Guoqing | Rank\n | 3rd\n | Member of the Politburo\n\n\n---\n\n\nIndustry and information technology, emergency management, and state-owned enterprises\n |\n| Name\n | Zhang Guoqing |\n| Constituency\n | Tibet At-large\n |\n| Birthplace\n | Luoshan County, Henan |\n| Took office\n | 12 March 2023\n |\n|  |\n| ![Liu Guozhong](image)Liu Guozhong | Rank\n | 4th\n | Member of the Politburo\n\n\n---\n\n\nAgriculture and rural affairs, health, poverty alleviation, and meteorology\n |\n| Name\n | Liu Guozhong |\n| Constituency\n | Henan At-large\n |\n| Birthplace\n | Wangkui County, Heilongjiang |\n| Took office\n | 12 March 2023\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Organic Law of the State Council of the People's Republic of China\". *National People's Congress*.

He has also been leader of the Central Leading Group on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs since March 2023.\n\n\nConsidered a close confidant of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping, Ding served on Xi's staff beginning in Shanghai, then followed him to Beijing. He served as the director of the CCP General Secretary's Office between 2013 and 2023 and the director of the CCP General Office between 2017 and 2023. He was also a member of the 19th Party Politburo, and a Secretary of the Party Secretariat between 2017 and 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nDing Xuexiang was born in Nantong, Jiangsu province, on 13 September 1962. He graduated from the Northeast Heavy Machinery Institute in Qinghuangdao, later renamed Yanshan University, in 1982 with a degree in engineering. Ding Xuexiang got his first job at the Shanghai Research Institute of Materials (SRIM) from 1982 to 1999, and joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1984.[1] Ding Xuexiang received a master's degree in public administration from Fudan University's School of Management in 1993.[2] At the Shanghai Research Institute of Materials, Ding advanced rapidly through various research, administrative, and party positions.\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nDing's rise to the Politburo was achieved primarily by climbing the ranks of the party.[2] Ding moved into politics after obtaining his first cadre position, as the deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Science & Technology Commission, in 1999.[3] Throughout his tenure at the SRIM, he attained leadership roles in propaganda, organization, general office, politics, and legal affairs, gaining valuable experience in all said fields. He moved up the ranks of the party apparatus in Shanghai, finishing off his time in the city as Secretary of the Political and Legal Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee in 2013.[4] He would first be elected to the Central Committee as an alternate member at the 18th Party Congress in 2012.\n\n\n\n### Politburo and Secretariat[edit]\n\n\nDing joined the Politburo and the Secretariat of the CCP in October 2017, as the director of the CCP General Office, and remained his post of the CCP General Secretary's office director (chief of staff).[5][6]\n\n\n\n## Vice Premiership[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the first plenary session of the 20th CCP Central Committee in October 2022, Ding was elevated to the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, the top decision-making body in China.[7] Ding also succeeded Han Zheng as the first vice premier of China and leader of the Central Leading Group on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs in March 2023.[8] His portfolio included development and reform,[9] education,[10] science and technology,[11] finance,[12] ecology and environment,[13] statistics,[14] and intellectual property.[15]\nIn July 2023 China and the European Union hold the Fourth EU-China High Level Environment and Climate Dialogue. The European delegation to China was led by Frans Timmermans, while China was represented by Ding Xuexiang as the Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China. Both sides declared they will continue to cooperate in stopping climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Both sides agree to ensure the success of COP28, implement the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, advance the High Seas Treaty, cooperate in water policy, reach a global agreement on plastic pollution by 2024. Both sides agree to support Circular economy.[16]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Ding Xuexiang\" (PDF). *brookings.edu*.

He has also been leader of the Central Leading Group on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs since March 2023.\n\n\nConsidered a close confidant of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping, Ding served on Xi's staff beginning in Shanghai, then followed him to Beijing. He served as the director of the CCP General Secretary's Office between 2013 and 2023 and the director of the CCP General Office between 2017 and 2023. He was also a member of the 19th Party Politburo, and a Secretary of the Party Secretariat between 2017 and 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nDing Xuexiang was born in Nantong, Jiangsu province, on 13 September 1962. He graduated from the Northeast Heavy Machinery Institute in Qinghuangdao, later renamed Yanshan University, in 1982 with a degree in engineering. Ding Xuexiang got his first job at the Shanghai Research Institute of Materials (SRIM) from 1982 to 1999, and joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1984.[1] Ding Xuexiang received a master's degree in public administration from Fudan University's School of Management in 1993.[2] At the Shanghai Research Institute of Materials, Ding advanced rapidly through various research, administrative, and party positions.\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nDing's rise to the Politburo was achieved primarily by climbing the ranks of the party.[2] Ding moved into politics after obtaining his first cadre position, as the deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Science & Technology Commission, in 1999.[3] Throughout his tenure at the SRIM, he attained leadership roles in propaganda, organization, general office, politics, and legal affairs, gaining valuable experience in all said fields. He moved up the ranks of the party apparatus in Shanghai, finishing off his time in the city as Secretary of the Political and Legal Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee in 2013.[4] He would first be elected to the Central Committee as an alternate member at the 18th Party Congress in 2012.\n\n\n\n### Politburo and Secretariat[edit]\n\n\nDing joined the Politburo and the Secretariat of the CCP in October 2017, as the director of the CCP General Office, and remained his post of the CCP General Secretary's office director (chief of staff).[5][6]\n\n\n\n## Vice Premiership[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the first plenary session of the 20th CCP Central Committee in October 2022, Ding was elevated to the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, the top decision-making body in China.[7] Ding also succeeded Han Zheng as the first vice premier of China and leader of the Central Leading Group on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs in March 2023.[8] His portfolio included development and reform,[9] education,[10] science and technology,[11] finance,[12] ecology and environment,[13] statistics,[14] and intellectual property.[15]\nIn July 2023 China and the European Union hold the Fourth EU-China High Level Environment and Climate Dialogue. The European delegation to China was led by Frans Timmermans, while China was represented by Ding Xuexiang as the Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China. Both sides declared they will continue to cooperate in stopping climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Both sides agree to ensure the success of COP28, implement the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, advance the High Seas Treaty, cooperate in water policy, reach a global agreement on plastic pollution by 2024. Both sides agree to support Circular economy.[16]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Ding Xuexiang\" (PDF). *brookings.edu*.

Previously, he served as the mayor of Tianjin, one of the four direct-controlled municipalities of China. An economics doctorate from Tsinghua University, Zhang had previously served as the Communist Party secretary of Liaoning, mayor of Chongqing, the chief executive of North Industries, a military contractor.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nZhang was born in 1964 in the town of Lingshan, Luoshan County, Henan province. He studied electrical engineering at the Changchun Institute of Optical Mechanics (now Changchun University of Science and Technology) and graduated in 1985. After graduating, he pursued a master's degree from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology in international trade.\n\n\n\n## Corporate career[edit]\n\n\nZhang worked at Norinco, a military supplier. He began work as a project manager, then worked in the company's operations in the Middle East, including a stint in the company's office in Tehran. He was promoted to vice president in 1996, and by 1998, he had become the Communist Party Secretary of the company, first-in-charge. He also became chairman of the Board of China Wanbao Engineering Ltd.[1] In 1999, Zhang began work for the China North Industries Group Corporation as a vice-president. By April 2004 he was promoted to chief executive of North Industries. During this time he also earned a doctorate in economics from Tsinghua University. Between September and November 2001 he took part in an executive management course at Harvard Business School.\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Zhang was named an alternate member of the 17th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and was one of the youngest members with a seat on the body (he was only 42 at the time). By 2012, China North Industries had secured a place in the Fortune Global 500. In 2012, he became a full member of the 18th CCP Central Committee.\n\n\nIn April 2013, Zhang took on a political office for the first time in his life, and was named deputy party chief of Chongqing;[2] three months later he also took on the role of president of the Chongqing party school, which is customary for deputy party chiefs of a jurisdiction.[3] Along with Ma Xingrui, Zhang was the only provincial-level deputy party chief with a full seat on the 18th Central Committee. In December 2016, Zhang was appointed the acting mayor of Chongqing.[4]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Zhang was appointed as the CCP Deputy Secretary of Tianjin.[5] Later, he was appointed as Mayor in January 2018.[6]\n\n\nOn September 1, 2020, Zhang was appointed as the CCP Secretary of Liaoning.[7]\n\n\nZhang is seen as a promising candidate for the \"6th generation of Chinese leadership\". Compared to his contemporaries, Zhang's background is unusual in that much of his career was spent as a corporate executive rather than in politics.\n\n\nAfter the 20th Party National Congress, he was elected as a member of the CCP Politburo. On 12 March 2023, he was appointed as a vice premier of China. His portfolio consisted of industry and information technology,[8] emergency management,[9] and state-owned enterprises.[10]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 张国清简历\n2. **^** 张国清接替张轩任重庆市委副书记\n3. **^** \"张国清兼任重庆市委党校校长\". 中国经济网.

Previously, he served as the mayor of Tianjin, one of the four direct-controlled municipalities of China. An economics doctorate from Tsinghua University, Zhang had previously served as the Communist Party secretary of Liaoning, mayor of Chongqing, the chief executive of North Industries, a military contractor.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nZhang was born in 1964 in the town of Lingshan, Luoshan County, Henan province. He studied electrical engineering at the Changchun Institute of Optical Mechanics (now Changchun University of Science and Technology) and graduated in 1985. After graduating, he pursued a master's degree from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology in international trade.\n\n\n\n## Corporate career[edit]\n\n\nZhang worked at Norinco, a military supplier. He began work as a project manager, then worked in the company's operations in the Middle East, including a stint in the company's office in Tehran. He was promoted to vice president in 1996, and by 1998, he had become the Communist Party Secretary of the company, first-in-charge. He also became chairman of the Board of China Wanbao Engineering Ltd.[1] In 1999, Zhang began work for the China North Industries Group Corporation as a vice-president. By April 2004 he was promoted to chief executive of North Industries. During this time he also earned a doctorate in economics from Tsinghua University. Between September and November 2001 he took part in an executive management course at Harvard Business School.\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Zhang was named an alternate member of the 17th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and was one of the youngest members with a seat on the body (he was only 42 at the time). By 2012, China North Industries had secured a place in the Fortune Global 500. In 2012, he became a full member of the 18th CCP Central Committee.\n\n\nIn April 2013, Zhang took on a political office for the first time in his life, and was named deputy party chief of Chongqing;[2] three months later he also took on the role of president of the Chongqing party school, which is customary for deputy party chiefs of a jurisdiction.[3] Along with Ma Xingrui, Zhang was the only provincial-level deputy party chief with a full seat on the 18th Central Committee. In December 2016, Zhang was appointed the acting mayor of Chongqing.[4]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Zhang was appointed as the CCP Deputy Secretary of Tianjin.[5] Later, he was appointed as Mayor in January 2018.[6]\n\n\nOn September 1, 2020, Zhang was appointed as the CCP Secretary of Liaoning.[7]\n\n\nZhang is seen as a promising candidate for the \"6th generation of Chinese leadership\". Compared to his contemporaries, Zhang's background is unusual in that much of his career was spent as a corporate executive rather than in politics.\n\n\nAfter the 20th Party National Congress, he was elected as a member of the CCP Politburo. On 12 March 2023, he was appointed as a vice premier of China. His portfolio consisted of industry and information technology,[8] emergency management,[9] and state-owned enterprises.[10]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 张国清简历\n2. **^** 张国清接替张轩任重庆市委副书记\n3. **^** \"张国清兼任重庆市委党校校长\". 中国经济网.
